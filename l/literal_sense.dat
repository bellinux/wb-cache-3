5|$|The term hatt-ı hümayun is {{occasionally}} {{used in the}} <b>literal</b> <b>sense</b> of {{the handwriting}} of the Sultan. For example, the imperial poet Nef'i has written a masnavi of 22 couplets describing the calligraphy of Sultan Murad IV, called Der-Vasf-ı Hatt-ı Humayun-ı Sultan Murad Han. The whole poem is a compliment to {{the writings of the}} Sultan.|$|E

25|$|The <b>literal</b> <b>sense</b> of {{understanding}} scripture {{is the meaning}} conveyed by the words of Scripture and discovered by exegesis, following the rules of sound interpretation. It has three subdivisions: the allegorical, moral, and anagogical (meaning mystical or spiritual) senses.|$|E
25|$|There {{may also}} be a {{connection}} between less <b>literal</b> <b>senses</b> of bitch and the Greek goddess Artemis. As she is the goddess of the hunt, she was often portrayed with a pack of hunting dogs and sometimes transformed into an animal herself. She is free, vigorous, cold, impetuous, unsympathetic, beautiful.|$|R
40|$|Metonymic {{location}} names {{refer to}} other, related entities and possess a meaning {{different from the}} <b>literal,</b> geographic <b>sense.</b> Metonymic names are to be treated differently to improve performance of geographic information retrieval (GIR). This paper presents a method for disambiguating location names in textual information to distinguish <b>literal</b> and metonymic <b>senses,</b> based on shallow features. The evaluation of this method is two-fold: First, we use a memory based learner to train a classifier and determine standard evaluation measures such as F-score and accuracy. Second, we perform retrieval experiments based on the Geo-CLEF data (newspaper article corpus and queries) from 2005. We compare searching for location names in an index containing their <b>literal</b> and metonymic <b>sense</b> with searching in an index containing <b>literal</b> <b>senses</b> only. Evaluation results indicate that, using a large annotated corpus of location names, a classifier based on shallow features achieves adequate performance, and removing metonymic senses from a database index yields a higher performance for GIR...|$|R

Rather, wretched serves here as a politer equivalent of expletive bloody and the like.|$|R
25|$|Not all Christians {{believe that}} demons {{exist in the}} <b>literal</b> <b>sense.</b> There is {{the view that the}} {{language}} of exorcism in the New Testament is an example of what was once employed to describe the healings of what would be classified in modern days as epilepsy, mental illness etc.|$|E
25|$|Social {{documentary}} in the <b>literal</b> <b>sense</b> are multifaceted documentations from workaday life {{in certain}} cities, landscapes and cultures.

Roman Vishniac may be mentioned as a characteristic representative, who documented Jewish life in Eastern Europe prior to the Holocaust (Verschwundene Welt, A Vanished World)|.|$|E
25|$|The terms blind (adjective) or {{to blind}} (transitive verb) {{when used in}} this sense are figurative {{extensions}} of the literal idea of blindfolding someone. The terms masked or to mask {{may be used for}} the same concept; this is commonly the case in ophthalmology, where the word 'blind' is often used in the <b>literal</b> <b>sense.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{theory of}} the mind is a core {{capacity}} in the social development of people {{that allows us to}} infer what another is thinking or feeling and behaving in a manner appropriate to a social situation. One of the main criticisms made to instruments measuring Theory of Mind, is that their results are not reflected in the situations of everyday life. In 1994, Happe created a test trying to overcome the constraints. The aim of this paper was to generate empirical evidence contributing to the validation and Spanish adaptation of the mind theory test named Strange Stories of Happé, used to assess the capability to recognise non <b>literal</b> <b>senses.</b> Results revealed a good internal consistency of the test. The factorial analysis showed five factors that explained the 54 % of the variance of data. Significant associations were found between non <b>literal</b> <b>senses</b> and social sensibility tests. Happé Strange stories are attempts to analyze aspects that come into play in everyday life and are an appropriate tool for evaluating the Theory of mind...|$|R
50|$|In {{the study}} of transsexualism, the essentialist idea of a {{feminine}} essence refers to the proposal that male-to-female transsexuals are females trapped in male bodies. This idea has been interpreted in many senses, as a female mind, spirit, soul, personality, etc., {{as well as in}} more <b>literal</b> <b>senses</b> such as having a female brain structure; it is also a psychological narrative, that is, a self-description of how some transsexuals see themselves, or of how they may portray themselves to qualify for certain medical treatments.|$|R

25|$|Ophelia, in Paul Griffiths' novel let me {{tell you}} (2008), is a {{derivative}} of Shakespeare's character who tells her story in her own words, in the <b>literal</b> <b>sense</b> that she can use only the words she is given in the play. She speaks of her childhood, of her parents and brother, of Hamlet, and of events leading up to {{the point at which the}} play begins.|$|E
25|$|Originally, all cricketers were amateurs in the <b>literal</b> <b>sense</b> of the word. Village cricket {{developed}} through the 17th century and teams typically comprised {{players who were}} all resident in the same village or parish. There {{is no evidence of}} professionalism before the English Civil War or during the Commonwealth but legal cases of the period have shown that cricket was played jointly by gentry and workers.|$|E
25|$|It is now {{believed}} that the club was originally a Thursday Club in the <b>literal</b> <b>sense</b> {{but that it was}} understood from the beginning that it considered itself to be representative of Middlesex as a county. It may even have had a Middlesex birth qualification for membership, like Yorkshire CCC so famously had until recently. Very soon, they decided to call themselves the Middlesex county team and so we have here a parallel with Hambledon Club/Hampshire.|$|E

25|$|Although {{prayer in}} its <b>literal</b> <b>sense</b> {{is not used}} in animism, {{communication}} with the spirit world {{is vital to the}} animist way of life. This is usually accomplished through a shaman who, through a trance, gains access to the spirit world and then shows the spirits' thoughts to the people. Other ways to receive messages from the spirits include using astrology or contemplating fortune tellers and healers. The native religions in some parts of North, East and South Asia, America, Africa, and Oceania are often animistic.|$|E
25|$|This visual {{interpretation}} encapsulates the personal piety of rural peasants, many illiterate, for whom salvation history was expressed in these crucial aspects of God's loving relationship {{with us and}} the Christian duty to love of neighbor. Sanctifying grace flows from the Paschal Victim on the Cross, an image Nicholas described in his vision by the stream, where the Tabernacle sits atop a spring that flows forth covering the earth, echoing the rivers flowing from the Temple in Ezekiel's visions. Such profound insights on the allegorical, anagogical and tropological senses of scripture are often lost in modern biblical exegesis that focuses too narrowly on the <b>literal</b> <b>sense,</b> the historical-critical method.|$|E
25|$|The <b>literal</b> <b>sense</b> {{pertains}} {{to the meaning of}} the words themselves, including any figurative meanings. The spiritual senses pertain to the significance of the things (persons, places, objects or events) denoted by the words. Of the three spiritual senses, the allegorical sense is foundational. It relates persons, events, and institutions of earlier covenants to those of later covenants, and especially to the New Covenant. Building on the allegorical sense, the moral sense instructs in regard to action, and the anagogical sense points to man's final destiny. The teaching of the Catechism on Scripture has encouraged the recent pursuit of covenantal theology, an approach that employs the four senses to structure salvation history via the biblical covenants.|$|E

40|$|The 'heart', {{together}} with 'hand' and 'head', {{is one of}} the three significant body parts in the letter H in both Old English and Modern English. This paper will explore how figurative and transferred senses may have arisen in English from the <b>literal</b> <b>senses</b> of 'heart', and also will suggest some of the phrasal richnesses which 'heart' develops, beginning with the earliest period of the language. This bodily organ is not only the vital principle, but is also the seat of feeling/will/intellect in the broadest sense. The word also deepens down both intellectually and emotionally to refer to the seat of one's innermost thoughts and of one's emotions (especially of love and affection, of courage or fear). This paper will attempt to trace the path of interiority and centredness which this word takes in its sense development in Old English with a view to its later history in English.

25|$|Several charges {{described}} as taxes are not, in the <b>literal</b> <b>sense,</b> actual taxes, but withholdings from certain payments made. In each case, the payer withholds the relevant percentage and pays it to Revenue. The recipient is still liable for {{tax on the}} full amount, but can set the withholding against his overall tax liability. If the amount withheld {{is less than the}} tax payable, the recipient is still liable for the difference, and if the amount withheld exceeds the tax payable, the recipient can set it off against other tax due, or obtain a refund. This contrasts with DIRT, which, while a withholding tax, discharges the entire tax liability of the recipient.|$|E
25|$|Statement {{measures}} tend {{to comprise}} more words, and hence consume more research instrument space, than lexical measures. Respondents are asked {{the extent to}} which they, for example, Talk to a lot of different people at parties or Often feel uncomfortable around others. While some statement-based measures of extraversion/introversion have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For example, statements asking about talkativeness in parties are hard to answer meaningfully by those who do not attend parties, as Americans are assumed to do. Moreover, the sometimes colloquial North American language of statements makes them less suited to use outside America. For instance, statements like Keep in the background and Know how to captivate people are sometimes hard for non-native English-speakers to understand except in a <b>literal</b> <b>sense.</b>|$|E
25|$|Verbal prefixes (cf. Vorsilben in German) {{are only}} written {{together}} with the verb they belong to if they immediately precede that verb. If the same verbal prefix is repeated to express repeated action, the first is divided by a hyphen, the second is written in one word (meg-megáll ’keep stopping once in a while’). If two verbal prefixes with an opposite meaning follow each other, both are written separately (le-föl sétál ’walk up and down’). Verbal prefixes may be written separately if {{the meaning of the}} prefix is stressed and the prefix is meant in a <b>literal</b> <b>sense,</b> but they must be written as one word if the meaning is changed (e.g. fenn marad ’stay upstairs’ but fennmarad ’survive, remain’). Some verbal prefixes coincide with adverbs that can have personal endings. In this case, they can only be written as one word if they are in the third person plural and the prefix/adverb is not stressed on its own (especially if the meaning is changed). Otherwise (if another person is used and/or the prefix/adverb is stressed) they should be written in two words.|$|E
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} semantic {{contribution of the}} individual words ‘why’ and ‘because', attempting to get clear on whether and how some of our central explanatory terminology gets disambiguated, and thereby to make some progress on a theory of ‘why’-questions that can tell us something substantive about explanation. I argue that ‘why’ and ‘because’ have <b>literal</b> causal <b>senses,</b> as well as distinct senses that we use to communicate metaphysical explanations. I show that apparent further semantic variations in the meaning of ‘because’ in its so-called epistemic and metalinguistic uses are illusory, and give a full explanation of those variations in terms of syntactic ambiguities. Finally, I argue that a causal metaphor unifies the senses of 'why' and 'because' at issue in metaphysical explanations with their <b>literal</b> causal <b>senses.</b> What this semantic investigation turns out to offer us, I argue, is {{a new understanding of}} the centrality of causal explanation to explanation in general...|$|R
