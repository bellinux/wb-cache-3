5|$|Due to {{the heavier}} {{concentration}} of Japanese surface combat vessels and their well-positioned <b>logistical</b> <b>base</b> at Simpson Harbor, Rabaul, and their {{victory at the}} Battle of Savo Island in early August, the Japanese had established operational control over the waters around Guadalcanal at night. However, any Japanese ship remaining within range—about —of American aircraft at Henderson Field, during the daylight hours, {{was in danger of}} damaging air attacks. This persisted for the months of August and September, 1942. The presence of Admiral Scott's task force at Cape Esperance represented the U.S. Navy's first major attempt to wrest night time operational control of waters around Guadalcanal away from the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Portuguese traders reached Sri Lanka by 1505 {{where their}} initial forays were against the {{south-western}} coastal Kotte kingdom {{due to the}} lucrative monopoly on trade in spices that the Kotte kingdom enjoyed that was also {{of interest to the}} Portuguese. The Jaffna kingdom {{came to the attention of}} Portuguese officials in Colombo for multiple reasons which included their interference in Roman Catholic missionary activities, (which was assumed to be patronizing Portuguese interests) and their support to anti-Portuguese factions of the Kotte kingdom, such as the chieftains from Sittawaka. The Jaffna Kingdom also functioned as a <b>logistical</b> <b>base</b> for the Kandyan kingdom, located in the central highlands without access to any seaports, as an entrypot for military aid arriving from South India. Further, due to its strategic location, it was feared that the Jaffna kingdom may become a beachhead for the Dutch landings. It was king Cankili I who resisted contacts with the Portuguese and even massacred 600-700 Parava Catholics in the island of Mannar. These Catholics were brought from India to Mannar to take over the lucrative pearl fisheries from the Jaffna kings.|$|E

Instead, in maneuver warfare, the destruction of certain enemy targets (command and control centers, <b>logistical</b> <b>bases,</b> fire support assets, etc.) is combined with isolation of enemy forces and the exploitation by movement of enemy weaknesses.|$|R
5|$|Khalid's {{strategy}} of {{withdrawing from the}} occupied areas and concentrating all of his troops for a decisive battle forced the Byzantines to concentrate their five armies in response. The Byzantines had for centuries avoided engaging in large-scale decisive battles, and the concentration of their forces created logistical strains for which the empire was ill-prepared. Damascus was the closest <b>logistical</b> <b>base,</b> but Mansur, leader of Damascus, could not fully supply the massive Byzantine army that was gathered at the Yarmouk plain. Several clashes were reported with local citizens over supply requisition, as summer was at an end {{and there was a}} decline of pasturage. Greek court sources accused Vahan of treason for his disobedience to Heraclius' command not to engage in large-scale battle with Arabs. Given the massing of the Muslim armies at Yarmouk, however, Vahan {{had little choice but to}} respond in kind. Relations between the various Byzantine commanders were also fraught with tension. There was a struggle for power between Trithurios and Vahan, Jarajis, and Qanatir (Buccinator). Jabalah, the Christian Arab leader, was largely ignored, to the detriment of the Byzantines given his knowledge of the local terrain. An atmosphere of mistrust thus existed between the Romans, Greeks, Armenians, and Arabs. Longstanding ecclesiastical feuds between the Monophysite and Chalcedonian factions, while of negligible direct impact, certainly inflamed underlying tensions. The effect of these feuds was decreased coordination and planning, one of the reasons for the catastrophic Byzantine defeat.|$|E
5|$|On 16 December 1944, the Germans {{launched}} a huge offensive in the Ardennes forest, with the German objective to split British and American forces apart and capture {{the port of}} Antwerp, an important <b>logistical</b> <b>base</b> for the Allies. The initial assaults were extremely successful, creating a salient some fifty miles wide and forty-five miles deep, and by 23 December German units were advancing towards Dinant. American resistance was fierce, however, and blunted German advances in several areas, particularly the U.S. 101st Airborne Division around the town of Bastogne. By Christmas Day the offensive had been halted and contained, and an Allied counter-offensive began. Although {{the majority of the}} troops committed belonged to the American First and Third Armies, British XXX Corps also participated, with the British 6th Airborne Division as one of its leading divisions. The division had been in England since the beginning of September, and had been due to go on Christmas leave only days before the counter-offensive began; however, it was quickly transported to the Ardennes, arriving on the night of 24 December. By 26 December the 6th Airborne Division, now commanded by Major-General Eric Bols, had positioned itself between the towns of Dinant and Namur, and on 29 December it advanced against the German salient, with the 3rd Parachute Brigade, under James Hill, occupying an area around Rochefort.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{increased}} resources of consolidated, bureaucratic states, {{coupled with the}} logistical needs of mass levies and large-scale warfare, led to the proliferation of economic projects such as large-scale waterworks. Major examples of such waterworks include the Dujiangyan Irrigation System, which controlled the Min River in Sichuan and turned the former backwater region into a major Qin <b>logistical</b> <b>base,</b> and the Zhengguo Canal which irrigated large areas {{of land in the}} Guanzhong Plain, again increasing Qin's agricultural output.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of transport infrastructure has been vital {{to maintain the}} economic position of Madrid.

25|$|In 1974, as Deputy Commander of Operations/III Corps, {{assistant}} to General Pham Quoc Thuan, Hiếu applied Blitzkrieg (lightning war) tactics {{to alleviate the}} pressure exerted by 5th NVA Division originating from Svay Rieng Province in the Parrot's Beak area of Cambodian territory aiming at Đức Huệ base camp. Hiếu employed twenty mobile battalions to surround the Parrot's Beak area. Secondly, on April 27, he launched 49th Infantry Regiment and 7th Ranger Group through the swamp lands around Đức Huệ towards the Cambodian border, and had VNAF airplanes attack positions of 5th NVA Division units. In the meantime, he relied on two Regional Force battalions belonging to IV Corps to move from Mộc Hóa up north to establish blocking positions on the southwestern edge of the 5th NVA Division's <b>logistical</b> <b>base</b> and assembly area. On 28 April, General Hiếu launched eleven battalions into the battleground to conduct preliminary operation in preparation of the main offensive.|$|E
25|$|The first amalgame {{began in}} 1793 and by 5 September five demi-brigades were created with a nominal {{strength}} of 2,437 men and {{divided into three}} battalions of 812 soldiers. Eventually, 18 more demi-brigades were formed, giving the army a total of 60,000 men. Of these, probably one-third served in garrisons and were of lower quality. Because {{it was difficult to}} procure forage, the cavalry was perpetually understrength and about two-thirds of the horses died {{during the course of the}} war. Fortunately, the terrain did not lend itself to operations by mounted troops. Military transport and the artillery also suffered from the problem of inadequate forage and never had enough horses. The artillery arm was built up from scratch into a considerable force thanks largely to the capture of 535 Spanish guns and the efforts of the army's artillery chief Augustin de Lespinasse. He also created a pontoon train and units of artisans who repaired muskets taken from the Spaniards. Another innovation of the Army of the Western Pyrenees was its organization of work companies. While the army's soldiers initially suffered due to lack of supplies, by the end of the war the troops were well equipped by their <b>logistical</b> <b>base</b> at Bayonne.|$|E

He had also agreed to allow the use of the port of Sihanoukville by communist-flagged vessels delivering supplies and material to support the PAVN/Viet Cong military effort in South Vietnam.

50|$|From {{the early}} days of the rebellion, Nasserite and other left wing {{movements}} in the neighbouring Aden Protectorate, later the Protectorate of South Arabia, were also involved. In 1967, two events combined to give the Rebellion a more revolutionary complexion. One was the Six Day War which radicalised opinion throughout the Arab world. The other was the British withdrawal from Aden and the establishment of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY). From this point, the rebels had a source of arms, supplies and training facilities adjacent to Dhofar, and fresh recruits from groups in the PDRY. Training camps, <b>logistical</b> <b>bases</b> and other facilities were set up in the coastal town of Hawf, only a few miles from the border with Oman.|$|R
50|$|The Central Intelligence Agency {{has been}} in the Philippines almost since the agency was created. The CIA was founded in 1947 and {{played a major role in}} the Philippines three years later. The visual aspects of having U.S. {{military}} bases imposed in the Philippines gave the CIA a greater presence. During this time the CIA ran many covert operations in the Philippines as it was also the place where other covert operations against other countries started. The CIA also has supply, training, and <b>logistical</b> <b>bases</b> on several different Filipino Islands. After their successful defeat of the Huk the CIA used this model in Vietnam and Latin America. The CIA used psychological warfare in the Philippines instead of just brute force to operate missions there.|$|R

50|$|To {{support the}} Bar Lev Line, Israel built an {{elaborate}} system of roads. Three main roads ran north-south. The {{first was the}} Lexicon Road (Infantry Road), running along the canal, which allowed the Israelis to move between the fortifications and conduct patrols. The second was the Artillery Road, around 10 - 12 km from the canal. Its name came from the twenty artillery and air defense positions located on it: it also linked armored concentration areas and <b>logistical</b> <b>bases.</b> The Lateral Road (Supply Road), 30 km from the canal, was meant to allow the concentration of Israeli operational reserves which, {{in case of an}} Egyptian offensive, would counterattack the main Egyptian assault. A number of other roads running east to west, Quantara Road, Hemingway Road, and Jerusalem Road, were designed to facilitate the movement of Israeli troops towards the canal.|$|R

He received numerous entreaties from President Abraham Lincoln, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, and General-in-Chief Henry W. Halleck to resume campaigning against Bragg, but rebuffed them through the winter and spring. A primary concern of the government was that if Rosecrans continued to sit idly, the Confederates might move units from Bragg's army in an attempt to relieve the pressure that Union Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant was applying to Vicksburg, Mississippi. Lincoln wrote to Rosecrans, [...] "I would not push you to any rashness, but I am very anxious that you do your utmost, short of rashness, to keep Bragg from getting lost to help Johnston against Grant." [...] Rosecrans offered the excuse that if he were to start to move against Bragg, then Bragg would likely relocate his entire army to Mississippi and threaten Grant's Vicksburg Campaign even more. Thus, by not attacking Bragg, he was helping Grant. Frustration with Rosecrans's excuses led Halleck to threaten to relieve him if he did not move, but in the end he merely protested [...] "against the expense to which [...] put the government for telegrams." ...|$|E
