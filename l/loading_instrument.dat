Lack of such knowledge precludes formulation of engineered scaffolds or tissue constructs that would deliver specific growth-inductive signals required for improved tissue restoration. This article describes a new mechanical loading–imaging technique that allows investigations of structural–mechanical properties of biomaterials {{as well as the}} structural–mechanical basis of cell–scaffold interactions at a microscopic level and in three dimensions. The technique is based upon the integration of a modified, miniature mechanical <b>loading</b> <b>instrument</b> with a confocal microscope. Confocal microscopy is conducted in a reflection and/or fluorescence mode for selective visualization of load-induced changes to the scaffold and any resident cells, while maintaining each specimen in a “live, ” fully hydrated state. This innovative technique offers several advantages over current biomechanics methodologies, including simultaneous visualization of scaffold and/or cell microstructure in three dimensions during mechanical loading; quantification of macroscopic mechanical parameters including true stress and strain; and the ability to perform multiple analyses on the same specimen.

In order to study the pressure changes in different parts of interior eyeball wall, it is necessary to develop a novel eye ball FEM with more accurate geometry and material properties. Use this model to study the stress changes in different parts of eyeball, especially the lamina cribrosa (LC) under normal physiological and pathological IOP, and provide a mathematical model for biomechanical studies of selected retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) death. Methods: (1) Sclera was cut into 3. 8 -mm wide, 14. 5 -mm long strips, and cornea was cut into 9. 5 -mm-wide and 10 -mm-long strips; (2) 858 Mini BionixII biomechanical <b>loading</b> <b>instrument</b> was used to stretch sclera and cornea. The stretching rate for sclera was 0. 3 mm/s, 3 mm/s, 30 mm/s, 300 mm/s; and for cornea were 0. 3 mm/s and 30 mm/s. The deformation-stress curve was recorded; (3) Naso-temporal and longitudinal distance of LC were measured; (4) Micro-CT was used to accurately scan fresh bovine eyes and obtain the geometrical image and data to establish bovine eye model. 3 -D reconstruction was performed using these images and data to work out the geometric shape of bovine eye; (5) IOP levels for eyeball FEM was set and the inner wall of eyeball was used taken as load-bearing part.

40|$|Lateritic unpaved {{roads are}} widely spread in Malaysian territory. These red-yellow {{lateritic}} layers normally have poor engineering properties such as large settlements, low shear strength and bearing capacity. Major difficulties may arise during {{the construction of}} a lateritic layer which are deterioration and diffusion of dust on the road surface, and also durability problems associated with cyclic loading repetition. Waste tires are encountered all over the world in increasing numbers. Shredded scrap tires and crumbssoil mixtures are currently used {{in a wide range of}} civil engineering structures like lightweight fills for slopes, retaining walls, embankments etc. This thesis presents and discusses the condition of lateritic soil stabilized by using the shredded tires, tire crumbs and traditional active additive materials such as cement and lime for unpaved road application. Experimental tests such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), california bearing ratio (CBR), consolidated undrained (CU) triaxial, permeability, and highway accelerated <b>loading</b> <b>instrument</b> (HALI) tests were carried out to evaluate the microstructures, elements, durability and geotechnical strength properties of tropical laterite soils. These tests were conducted to determine the influence of stabilizers on the surface of the lateritic soil layers in terms of loading cycles, and short term behaviour. The quick undrained triaxial and CBR tests were carried out on samples at different curing times to establish the optimum mix design. The strength parameters were determined from CU triaxial tests on unsoaked samples. The HALI test was used to study the strength, durability and deformation after determination of the best formulation for each stabilizer in combination with laterite soils under accelerated trafficking load, simultaneously. The close range Photogrammetry technique was also used to capture images of deformed untreated and treated surface. The camera data were analysed using software known as Australis, and Surfer 10 were used to evaluate the performance of unpaved road stabilization with traditional active additives and waste tires. After eliciting of results and data and use of the comparison curves, the behaviour of stabilized soil with different combination were determined. The highest and lowest permeability were STc (soil and tire crumbs) and SC (soil and cement) at 14 days, respectively. The highest CBR values occurred for SC on unsoaked condition in 14 days. The HALI test shows that the highest reduction in settlement was exhibited by SL (soil- 6 %lime) after 14 days curing. Also, the experimental results show that 6 % of lime/cement and 6 % of shredded tires/tires crumbs changed the soil strength, durability, and permeability properties of the lateritic soil for unpaved road applications. The results indicate that the shredded scrap tire and crumbs mixed with active additive had reduced the settlement significantly and also had increased the strength. The analysis of data by close range Photogrammetry technique shows a close approximation to the data obtained from LVDT’s equipment (less than 4. 5 % variance). The numerical simulation results carried out using ABAQUS 6. 11 show a noticeable similarity to the results obtained by full scale HALI model and it is recommended using ABAQUS to simulate the unpaved road behaviour under cyclic loading to save time and cost...|$|E

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of its development, the X-ray CT technique originally was developed for medical analysis. However, along with the advances in technology, the ability of X-ray CT continues to increase. Therefore, the use of X-ray CT is no longer intended for medical application but has expanded to other fields such as civil engineering especially for material science. Related to construction materials, there are many experimental methods {{that can be used}} to study the microstructure of cementitious materials such as scanning electron microscope (SEM), backscattered electron (BSE), mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and permeability test. However, each of those experimental methods generally only provides a few aspects related to the microstructure of cementitious materials. On the other hand, there are many aspects which can be obtained from the microstructure of cementitious materials just through the use of X-ray CT technique. This present study describes the versatility of the application of X-ray CT technique to study the microstructure and diffusivity of cementitious materials. In this research, there are two types of X-ray CT systems used to acquire the 3 D image of the internal structure of cementitious materials i. e. synchrotron X-ray CT with spatial resolution of 0. 5 m and micro-focus X-ray CT with lower resolution (> 10 m/pixel). The first and arguably the most important in the use of X-ray CT is the observation of the three-dimensional pore structure of the hardened cementitious materials. The application of X-ray CT certainly can be expanded through the use of different types of cementitiousmaterials as well as its curing period. In this case, cement paste specimen mixed with silica fume and fly ash (low alkali binder) was used and Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) cement paste was prepared as a comparison. The pore structure parameters such ash total porosity, connectivity, and pore size distribution were obtained through the analysis of 3 D microtomographic images. Furthermore, Random Walk Simulation (RWS) was performed to quantify the diffusion tortuosity in the pore structure. It is found that the diffusion tortuosityof percolated porosity of OPC cement paste was higher than that of low alkali cement paste at the same curing periods. On the other hand, despite having a lower resolution, the use of micro-focus X-ray CTwas intended to identify the larger void space in cementitious materials such as cracks and air voids and also allows us to use the specimens with larger size. Micro-focus X-ray CT wasemployed to observe cracked mortar specimens due to mechanical loading. The cracks in beam specimens of the size of 10 x 20 x 60 mm and cylinder specimens of the size of 20 mmin diameter and 40 mm in height were induced by flexural test and splitting tensile test,respectively. Subsequently, the 3 D crack geometry was obtained from microtomographicimages. Through the analysis of 3 D crack geometry, the crack geometry parameters such astortuosity and constrictivity were obtained. The tortuosity of flexural crack and splittingtensile crack in the mortar specimen with maximum size of aggregate of 1. 7 mm were foundto be around 1. 13 and 1. 25, respectively, and it was independent to the crack opening widthand whether fly ash was added or not. Meanwhile, it is found that the type of cracks and thepresence of void play an important role on the constrictivity of the crack. The constrictivityincreased for fly ash mortar having roughly the equivalent crack opening width of OPCmortar. The scope of the observation using X-ray CT was expanded even further. Theapplication of micro-focus X-ray CT coupled with in-situ tracer diffusion test was conductedto clarify the transport mechanism in cracked mortar specimens. Diffusivity in the crack wascontrolled by following factors: the crack opening width, as well as, by its constrictivity. Thediffusive transport was also restricted due to the presence of air pockets in the crack. In thisregard, a diffusion-accessible path factor was proposed to account for the degree of wateriisaturation within the crack space. In addition, it was confirmed that the addition of fly ashcould reduce the diffusivity through the uncracked body as compared with normal OPCmortar of equivalent diffusion coefficient along the crack. Furthermore, the variations in cementitious materials were added. In this regard,deteriorated specimens were used in X-ray CT observation. There were three types ofdeterioration applied in the specimen namely leaching, mechanical loading and hightemperature exposure followed by re-curing. X-ray CT technique was used to observe thechange in microstructure in cementitious materials as the effect of deterioration. As forleaching, after the observation using synchrotron X-ray CT and image analysis, the totalporosity and percolated porosity of normal cement paste specimen significantly increasedafter leaching test as compared to that of cement paste specimen with low alkali binder. Dissolution of hydration product in normal cement paste specimen dramatically reduced thediffusion tortuosity in the percolated porosity of normal cement paste specimen. On the otherhand, although there was a reduction in the diffusion tortuosity for percolated porosity ofcement paste specimen with low alkali binder, however, it was not dramatically whencompared with that of normal cement paste specimen. In the study of deteriorated cementitious materials due to mechanical loading,synchrotron X-ray CT was combined with micro-tensile instrument and the observationduring the application of load was conducted in-situ inside synchrotron X-ray CT chamber. Although there was no definite result of this experiment, however, by improving the qualityboth sample preparation and <b>loading</b> <b>instrument,</b> the behavior of microstructure under externalload can be observed through the application of synchrotron X-ray CT combined with othermechanical tests. Using micro-focus X-ray CT, concrete specimen in three different conditions, namelybefore heating, after heating and re-curing was examined. It was observed that cracksoccurred in the concrete specimen due to heating can be categorized into three types of cracks,namely interfacial cracks between mortar and coarse aggregates, bridging cracks betweenaggregates and bridging cracks between aggregates and air voids. Therefore, the volume oftotal and percolated porosity of heated specimen increased due to the presence of these cracks. Furthermore, we observed that water re-curing is more effective in the recovery ofmicrostructure of concrete after high temperature exposure as compared with that of airre-curing. Through the application of X-ray CT technique this research could provide betterunderstanding of the microstructure change in cementitious materials. In addition, with theproposed X-ray CT technique coupled with in-situ tracer diffusion test, the transportmechanism of diffusion inside crack and through the uncracked matrix would be furtherunderstood. Therefore, this research can contribute to the clarification of durability aspect andto more accurate prediction of service life for concrete structures...|$|E

Four multilayer NbN/CrN coatings were produced with different periodicities (20 nm, 10 nm, 7. 5 nm and 4 nm) with total thickness from 25 to 30 μm in all cases. The coatings were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), which provided the lattice parameter {{in each of the}} constituent layers and structural analysis of the multilayers, respectively. The multilayer coating system is composed of CrN and NbN with similar structures, but with a lattice mismatch, which varies the fraction of the region with lattice strain depending on the periodicity. For the thicker individual layers, the adjustment of lattice parameter at the interfaces does not represent a predominant fraction of the entire structure, i. e. separate peaks of NbN and CrN can be distinguished in the XRD analysis. In the presence of low periodicity (lower than 10 nm), the lattice of each constituent may be coherently strained and just one intermediate lattice (d-spacing) is detected for the NbN/CrN multilayer. Mechanical and tribological characterization was conducted by microhardness measurements using a 500 mN <b>load</b> (<b>Instrumented</b> indentation) and scratch tests using a conical diamond indenter with a 0. 1 mm tip radius.
