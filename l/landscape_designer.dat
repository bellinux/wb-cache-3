5|$|Further major {{additions}} {{were made}} to the building by Sir John Hugh Smyth (1734–1802). He inherited the estate in 1783 and added the new library to the north west of the house. Sir John also asked the famous <b>landscape</b> <b>designer</b> Humphry Repton for advice about the east front of the house. Repton drafted a plan but Sir John's death halted any further work on the house. However Repton's landscape designs were implemented by Sir John's successor Sir Hugh Smyth. In his book Humphry Repton gave {{a detailed description of the}} old and newer parts of the house before the library additions and included a drawing of the eastern front of the house as he saw it in about 1790.|$|E

25|$|Botanical Gardens, {{designed}} by French architect and <b>landscape</b> <b>designer</b> Carlos Thays, {{the garden was}} inaugurated on 7 September 1898. Thays and his family lived in an English style mansion, located within the gardens, between 1892 and 1898, when he served as director of parks and walks in the city. The mansion, built in 1881, is currently the main building of the complex.|$|E
25|$|Walker Arboretum: Located {{along the}} {{hillside}} of Rodman Hall and the Twelve Mile Creek below, the original owner of this estate was Thomas Rodman Merritt, son of William Hamilton Merritt. In the late 19th century, an English <b>landscape</b> <b>designer</b> named Samuel Richardson {{was hired by}} Merritt to tend the grounds. As a result, the arboretum is an extensive, rambling garden with rare conifers which benefit from an exceptional micro-climate. It boasts {{one of the largest}} Chinese Empress trees in Canada.|$|E

25|$|The first {{superintendent}} of the Port Phillip region, Charles La Trobe, set aside large tracts of land around the city for open space, parkland and gardens. Much of this land has since been excised for public infrastructure like sporting complexes, railways, hospitals and other public buildings, and also for residential development, but a substantial amount has remained. This allowed <b>landscape</b> <b>designer</b> Clement Hodgkinson and Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne, William Guilfoyle, to landscape many of the parks and gardens. Many of these parks and gardens are within easy {{walking distance of the}} central business district.|$|E
25|$|A {{memorial}} {{was erected}} {{on the grounds}} of Montoursville High School. It is a statue of an angel (sculpted by James Barnhill of Asheville, North Carolina) on a base engraved with the names of the 21 local victims and a brief history. The memorial is in a circular grove of 21 trees, one for each person lost. The angel was chosen because onlookers thought a cloud seen above the high school on July 21, 1996, resembled an angel, with 21 small clouds at its feet. Randolph Hudson of State College was chosen as the memorial designer and Beth Hershberger served as <b>landscape</b> <b>designer.</b>|$|E
25|$|Niagara Falls {{have long}} {{been a source of}} {{inspiration}} for explorers, travelers, artists, authors, filmmakers, residents and visitors, few of whom realize the falls were nearly devoted solely to industrial and commercial use. In the 1870s, sightseers had limited access to Niagara Falls and often had to pay for a glimpse, and industrialization threatened to carve up Goat Island to further expand commercial development. Other industrial encroachments and lack of public access led to a conservation movement in the U.S. known as Free Niagara, led by such notables as Hudson River School artist Frederic Edwin Church, <b>landscape</b> <b>designer</b> Frederick Law Olmsted, and architect Henry Hobson Richardson. Church approached Lord Dufferin, governor-general of Canada, with a proposal for international discussions on the establishment of a public park.|$|E

25|$|In 1865–67 {{a beacon}} was {{installed}} on the southeast terrace {{of the building and}} a telegraph service was started, while nearby a gas factory was built, producing smoke that prompted many protests. The first moves to preserve and rehabilitate the tower began {{in the latter part of}} the 20th century. First, the tower was transferred to the Ministry of Finance in 1940, which undertook small conservation works. Then the military quarters on the battlements were removed and the inner cloister was built. The architectural <b>landscape</b> <b>designer</b> António Viana Barreto began a three-year project in 1953 to integrate the tower with the local shoreline. In 1983 the site hosted the 17th European Exhibition on Art, Science and Culture, and various projects involving the building were undertaken, among them covering the cloister with a transparent plastic cupola. In the same year the Belém Tower was classified by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.|$|E
25|$|Ignacio Messina (Cheech Marin): He is the <b>landscape</b> <b>designer</b> whom Maxine {{hired to}} work on her garden. The two became close, but Maxine learned he was not legally {{divorced}} from his wife and he had two children: Courtney Messina (Jossara Jinaro) and Raul Messina (Tito Ortiz). Ignacio's mother hated Maxine, which she found extremely funny. Maxine refused to date him when she learned his divorce wasn't final. They continued their friendship bound by a complicated set of rules Maxine established to prove they weren't dating. He remained very supportive during Maxine's health problems. When his divorce became final, they began dating again in a complicated relationship. At one point Maxine thought they were getting too close and she actually gave him away to her friend Patsy. She later regretted it and asked Ignacio to dump Patsy. He refuses to live by Maxine's ever changing rules and confronts her with a marriage proposal as a solution, which she accepts.|$|E
25|$|Hammerwood is sited on a south-facing hill, {{commanding}} extensive {{views from}} the south-west to the south-east; its own southern façade looking across the valley to a stream where the iron forge which gave the estate its name once sat. A serpentine lake, artificially dammed from this steam apparently {{as part of the}} Sperlings' landscaping (not shown on a Gardner and Gream map of 1795 but visible on the OS drawing of 1808) sits {{at the bottom of the}} valley with open parkland on either side; views of distant hills continue for two or three miles beyond. Scholars Fazio and Snadon note Latrobe's 1794 reference to a 'very intimate' acquaintance with Humphry Repton (1752–1818), the English <b>landscape</b> <b>designer,</b> and suggest that many features of the Hammerwood landscape (including unobstructed views to the south which extend far further than the 1792 boundaries of the estate) align with Repton's ideas. The influence of Capability Brown has also been noted, and ring counts of oaks felled by the Great Storm of 1987 dated them to 1793 and 1796 (suggesting that landscaping and replanting did indeed take place).|$|E

To encourage people to settle in the area, each parcel included a membership to Lagunita Country Club, which was officially opened in 1964. Brazilian <b>landscape</b> <b>designer</b> Roberto Burle Marx contributed to this project, constructed on the 4.3 million m² hacienda that once belonged to former Venezuelan president, Eleazar López Contreras.

500|$|Walter Law hired Pennsylvania {{architect}} Guy King {{to construct}} the Briarcliff Lodge on the highest point of Law's estate. At its June 26, 1902 opening, the Tudor Revival-style building was a premier resort hotel with 93 rooms. The Olmsted Brothers, sons of the eminent <b>landscape</b> <b>designer</b> Frederick Law Olmsted, designed the lodge's surrounding grounds, including a large hillside landscape garden with shady walks, winding drives, green lawns, and flowers. In 1903, the lodge additionally began being used by Mary Elizabeth Dow as Mrs. Dow's School.
