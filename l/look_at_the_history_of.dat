25|$|When {{addressing}} {{police brutality}} in Latvia, {{it is important}} to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the country and how this affects its police and brutality towards the population. Latvia became an independent Republic in 1918 and attempted to develop an effective and accepted police force, moving away from the untrusted Russian Tsarist Administration. Despite positive post-independence aims to reform the police system and to maintain public order and security, the Latvian police were underfunded and under-resourced. The National Militia was created in response, being a voluntary force for the protection of public order. Policing during this period was quite successful, being assimilated to what is today referred to as community policing.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the current}} state of cinema, Korine comments, [...] "When I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> film – the early {{commercial}} narrative movies directed by D.W.

2500|$|Now there's a {{weird thing}} going on. Partly {{proposed}} by {{a colleague of}} mine writing in The Nation, Christopher Hitchens. He is saying, somehow {{he seems to be}} saying, it is wrong to look at history, it is wrong to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the past century. You don't have to exonerate the appalling deeds of Osama bin Laden and his associates, if it be Osama bin Laden, to say who brought this down, who contributed to this, a number of factors. We have to look at history. For someone like Hitchens to attack Chomsky, as he's done in The Nation, saying he is somehow 'soft' on fascism because [...] tries to read history is an outrage – an absolute outrage.|$|E

2500|$|Birdo {{has been}} the subject of {{discussion}} relating to her gender identity. Simon Carless, writing for Gamasutra, described Birdo as [...] "infamously gender-confused". It is speculated by Wireds Chris Kohler that the gender issue was retconned to make her female, while video game developer Jennifer Diane Reitz suggests that she underwent gender reassignment surgery. In the book Vintage Games: An Insider <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>History</b> <b>of</b> Grand Theft Auto, Super Mario, and the Most Influential Games of All Time, the authors describe Birdo as the most notable character in Super Mario Bros. 2 due to being the first transgender character in video games. In three different articles for GamesRadar, Chris Antista commented about her gender confusion and stated that the revelation was similar to when [...] "lead singer of Judas Priest came out to a legion of homophobic metalheads dressed to the nines in skin tight leather left wondering if their dicks will fall off." ...|$|E
2500|$|Common to {{the trilogy}} was a {{somewhat}} morbid <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the Russian monarchy {{of the previous}} three centuries, where, as the author saw it, all the efficient rulers happened to be evil, and all the 'good' ones proved to be inefficient. The three stories of three different historical figures had similarly didactic finales: [...] "God help you, Tsar Ivan, and God forgive us all! That's the fate autocracy deserved! Here's the result of our disintegration!" [...] (Zakharyin's words over Ivan the Terrible's dead body), [...] "I am to blame for all of this... Oh God, why did you make me Tsar?!" [...] (Tsar Fyodor), [...] "What Evil spawns is only more evil and nothing else." [...] (Boris Godunov). All three parts of the trilogy, which, according to Nestor Kotlyarevsky, were [...] "united {{by the idea of}} tragedy being intrinsic to Tsarist power in Russia," [...] had serious problems with the censorship. The trilogy continued to divide opinion in Russia up until 1917. Not long before the Revolution, in Alexandrinsky Theatre the public reacted to Tsar Boris in an overtly political fashion. Monarchists applauded Boris Godunov's words, the left [...] "supported" [...] boyarin Sitsky, seeing in him a fighter of despotism.|$|E
2500|$|Similar {{to season}} eight and nine, {{there will also}} be a new main villain. The {{producers}} revealed that Darkseid will fulfill this role for the final season, but will be a different incarnation than his comic book counterpart. They explained that Darkseid's presence will be felt throughout the whole season, but that he will not actually appear until near the end; unlike in previous seasons where the main villain was present from the start. Instead, Darkseid's minions—Granny Goodness, Desaad, Glorious Godfrey, and others to be named—will appear throughout the season as the physical presence for Clark to battle. That said, Darkseid will make an appearance in the season premiere, digitally created to start with, but with [...] "more solid forms" [...] making a short appearance by the third episode. The plan is for Darkseid's presence to be established as he takes over the bodies of various characters. The executive producers also wanted to take a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> Smallvilles Clark Kent in the 200th episode of the series. According to Peterson, [...] " [...] explore {{a little bit of the}} past, the present and the future. We kind of do a little look back to where we've been and we also take a look at where Clark is going." ...|$|E

60|$|Secondly, {{they have}} made the king the prime mover in all this {{political}} wickedness: {{they have made}} the king tell his people that they were deprived of their rights, and, by direct and necessary implication, that they and their ancestors for a century past had been slaves: they have made the king vilify {{the memory of his}} own brother and father. Rights! There are no rights whatever without corresponding duties. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the growth of our constitution, and you will see that our ancestors never upon any occasion stated, as a ground for claiming any of their privileges, an abstract right inherent in themselves; you will nowhere in our parliamentary records find the miserable sophism of the Rights of Man. No! they were too wise for that. They took good care to refer their claims to custom and prescription, and boldly--sometimes very impudently--asserted them upon traditionary and constitutional grounds. The Bill is bad enough, God knows; but the arguments of its advocates, and the manner of their advocacy, are a thousand times worse than the Bill itself; and you will live to think so.|$|E

60|$|In {{carrying}} out all this, {{it will be}} safest, as always, to follow the course of nature, and begin where God begins with us. For as {{every one of us}} is truly a microcosm, a whole miniature world within ourselves, so is the history of each individual more or less the history of the whole human race, and there are few of us but pass through the same course of intellectual growth, through which the whole English nation has passed, with an exactness and perfection proportionate, of course, to the richness and vigour of each person's character. Now as in the nation, so in the individual, poetry springs up before prose. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> English literature, how completely it is the history of our own childhood and adolescence, in its successive fashions. First, fairy tales--then ballads of adventure, love, and war--then a new tinge of foreign thought and feeling, generally French, as it was with the English nation in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries--then elegiac and reflective poetry--then classic art begins to influence our ripening youth, as it did the youth of our nation in the sixteenth century, and delight in dramatic poetry follows as a natural consequence--and last, but not least, as the fruit of all these changes, a vigorous and matured prose. For indeed, as elocution is the highest melody, so is true prose the highest poetry. Consider how in an air, the melody is limited to a few arbitrary notes, and recurs at arbitrary periods, while the more scientific the melody becomes, the more numerous and nearly allied are the notes employed, and the more complex and uncertain is their recurrence--in short, the nearer does the melody of the air approach to the melody of elocution, in which the notes of the voice ought continually to be passing into each other, by imperceptible gradations, and their recurrence to depend entirely on the emotions conveyed in the subject words. Just so, poetry employs a confined and arbitrary metre, and a periodic recurrence of sounds which disappear gradually in its higher forms of the ode and the drama, till the poetry at last passes into prose, a free and ever-shifting flow of every imaginable rhythm and metre, determined by no arbitrary rules, but only by the spiritual intent of the subject. The same will hold good of whole prose compositions, when compared with whole poems.|$|E
