5000|$|Many of Kerala's export-based {{industries}} that use Kochi port to route their shipments can grow considerably if they tap {{the potential of}} the State's inland water transport system. Kochi port is connected to Kerala's hinterland through inland waterways which run virtually parallel to the Arabian Sea and link major trading centres. [...] Future potentiality of business improves with improvements in external and internal factors. International Container Trans-shipment Terminal (ICTT) at Vallarpadam at Cochin Coast is one of such external factor which will create lot of future potential for IWAI in Kerala. The expectations from ICTT are to attract more international cargo movement through India and to reduce the freight cost of India’s international trade. IWAI has already taken steps to utilize such opportunity. Two special terminals, which support the interchange of containers by <b>LO-LO</b> (Lift On, Lift Off) and RO-RO (Roll On, Roll Off) barges, are constructed on NW3, near Kochi port.Traffic will, in all likelihood, come to a halt in Kochi when hundreds of container-laden lorries take to the city roads and highways when the Vallarpadam container transhipment terminal becomes functional.Presuming that a container will be loaded and another one unloaded every minute, 2,880 lorries will pass through Kochi’s highways daily. It is proposed to be given to transport the containers in vessels passing through the National Waterway III,” he said.A number of industrial plants on the banks of Udyogamandal Canal, where the public sector FACT and Travancore Cochin Chemicals (TCC) are located. Though waterways are the cheapest, safest and most eco-friendly mode of transport, many of the navigable canals in Kochi are now being used to dump waste from households, shops and markets. Many houses and businesses have encroached on these canals, narrowing them. Bridges such as the one at Kaloor are low-level, hampering the safe passage of boats. This calls for concerted efforts by agencies such as the Inland Waterways Authority of India, the KSINC and the Irrigation and Fisheries departments.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the main}} {{features}} of Short Sea Shipping (SSS) services offered at Italian ports are analysed. Both container and Ro-Ro Italian SSS networks are considered. In {{the first part of}} the paper, domestic and international Ro-Ro routes in 2008 and 2010 are taken into account, which depart or arrive from/to Italian ports; weekly frequencies are presented, and their values in years 2008 and 2010 are compared. For each Italian port the number of domestic and international Mediterranean direct and indirect destinations are reported (direct connections are routes where two ports are linked without any intermediate stop: for example, in the route Livorno-Olbia-Cagliari, Livorno is directly linked to Olbia and is indirectly linked to Cagliari). An accessibility matrix is shown, which reports for each Italian seaport the number of Ro-Ro ship departures to all other Italian ports. The Mediterranean containerised SSS links to/from Italian ports are taken into consideration in the second section of the work. Italian ports served by <b>Lo-Lo</b> containerised SSS services are listed, together with the number of direct and indirect destinations and the number of monthly ship departures, for both domestic and international freight traffic. Accessibility matrixes for <b>Lo-Lo</b> containerised Italian domestic SSS services are reported which point out that the majority of <b>Lo-Lo</b> containerised routes are “circular”. 	In the third part of the note a comparison between Italian Ro-Ro and containerised SSS networks have been carried out. First it can be noticed that Ro-Ro connections are routes that link together two or three ports, and only rarely involve a greater number of ports, whereas <b>Lo-Lo</b> routes connect together a huge number of ports, up to 10 or more. Furthermore, the most relevant ports in Ro-Ro and <b>Lo-Lo</b> Italian SSS networks are different ones. In order to evaluate the connectivity of the <b>Lo-Lo</b> and Ro-Ro SSS networks, two measures have been used: the beta index and the gamma index. Very small differences emerge from the analysis of connectivity: with a slightly higher degree of connectivity showed by the <b>Lo-Lo</b> containerised network. From the comparison between the Italian <b>Lo-Lo</b> containerised and Ro-Ro SSS networks carried out in the paper results that Ro-Ro and containerised SSS service at Italian ports form networks with different characteristics. The most relevant ports in Ro-Ro and <b>Lo-Lo</b> Italian SSS networks are different ones. The routes are also different: the Ro-Ro network is based mainly on return origin-destination trips, whereas <b>Lo-Lo</b> lines do operate longer routes, with several intermediate stops. The number of destinations served in the Mediterranean region at Italian ports is higher for the container network compared to the Ro-Ro network, but the number of monthly ship departures registered in the container network is lower. With reference to the Italian domestic services, the accessibility analysis clearly demonstrates that the connectivity of <b>Lo-Lo</b> network relies very much on indirect links, whereas the Ro-Ro network is formed almost only by direct port connections...|$|E

40|$|Phonons {{represent}} the quantization of lattice vibration, responsible for heat transfer in semiconductors and dielectrics. Phonon heat conduction across interfaces is crucially {{important for the}} thermal management of real-life devices such as smartphones, electric vehicles, and satellites. Although recent studies have broadly investigated spectral phonon contribution to lattice thermal conductivity, the mechanism of phonon modal transport across interfaces is still not well-understood. Previous models, including the acoustic mismatch model (AMM) and diffuse mismatch model (DMM), only consider elastic process while neglecting inelastic phonon contributions. Herein, we employ spectral Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics Simulation (NEMD) to probe the temperature and heat flux of each phonon mode, particularly resolving phonon information near the interface constructed by silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge). We impose a heat flux across the interfaces and observe a temperature profile. After exactly mapping the phonon modal transmission from Si to Ge, we find that all the acoustic-acoustic transmission is elastic and optical phonons contribute almost 50 % of the heat flux. Surprisingly, inelastic phonon transmission contributes 43 % to interfacial conductance, all by TO-TO and <b>LO-LO</b> transmissions. Besides, there exists nearly 20 % mode conversion, i. e., TA-LA and LA-LO conversions, where T, L, O, and A denotes transverse, longitudinal, optical and acoustic, respectively. The results show significant non-equilibrium between different phonon modes at the interface. Also, low-energy phonons carry {{a large amount of}} heat with small temperature drops. The modal phonon heat flux corroborates that the thermal transport across interfaces is contributed by both elastic and inelastic phonon transmission...|$|E
40|$|In Zn ion-buffered media, oceanic species (Thalassiosira oceanica and Emiliania hu. xZeyi) grew at near-maximal {{rates at}} the lowest free Zn ion {{concentration}} ([Zn 2 +] = lo- 12, 3 M), whereas coastal species (Thalassiosira pseudonana and Thalassiosira weissflogii) were limited at [Zn 2 +] < lo- ” M. The ability of the oceanic species to outgrow coastal ones at low [Zn 2 +] was due almost entirely to a reduced growth requirement for cellular Zn rather than to an increased capability for uptake. All isolates exhibited similar sigmoidal relationships between cellular Zn: C ratios and [Zn 2 +] with minimal slopes at [Zn 2 +] of lO-‘o. 5 to- 1 O- 9. 5 M and increasing slopes above and below this range. The minimal slopes at intermediate [Zr?+] {{could be explained by}} negative feedback regulation of a high-affinity Zn uptake system, while increased slopes at high [Zn 2 +] appeared to be related to uptake by a low-affinity site. Measured relationships between cellular Zn: C ratios and [Zn’+] agreed well with those computed from a modified Redfield model based on depth profiles for Zn and PO, concentrations and Zn chelation in the nutricline of the North Pacific. This agreement provides evidence that Zn concentrations in the nutricline are controlled by biological uptake and regen-eration as occurs for major nutrients. There is mounting evidence that the dis-tribution and chemical speciation of certain trace metal nutrients and the growth and species composition of phytoplankton com-munities are tightly linked (Morel and Hud-son 1984; Sunda 199 1). Like major nutri-ents, many trace metal nutrients occur at concentrations in surface oceanic waters that are orders of magnitude lower than those in coastal environments.

30|$|It is {{regularly}} claimed that SSS has more potential to transport freight. When {{the data are}} analyzed (e.g. in terms of ton kilometers) {{it is found that}} SSS already has a market share of 33 %. In order to understand the influencing factors on SSS in European countries also the SSS market segments are important. The SSS sector and market segments; The short sea market is diverse and complicated and can be divided into several different classifications of market segments. Basically, there are six ways to distinguish market segments (adapted from European Commission 2015): 1. Type of products, 2. Volumes according to geography, 3. Vessels, 4. Type of contracts, 5. Transport distance, and 6. SSS suppliers. Precise data (e.g. origin-destination) about type of products being transported in Europe by SSS are lacking but {{it would be interesting to}} analyze data about dry bulk, liquid bulk, containers, neo-bulk, and ferries in much more detail. Secondly, the SSS sector can be viewed according to volumes transported with a geographical focus. Data about volumes could be distinguished according to sea regions or country (which is the basis for the data analysis that we perform on the influencing factors of SSS in countries in Section 4). Thirdly, transport means could be used to distinguish different market segments: the size of the SSS vessels, or roll-on-roll-off (RO-RO) versus load-on-load-off (<b>LO-LO).</b> The SSS market could also be distinguished according to contract type: voyage versus period charters. Fifthly, different market segments according to transport distance could be of interest for data analysis. According to Brooks and Trifts (2008), mode choice for distances under 700 kms is dominated by truck, and distances over 1400 kms by intermodal transport. Finally, the focus could be on the number and type of SSS companies. These different ways of distinguishing the different market segments in SSS serve to indicate the quite fragmented and complicated character of the SSS market (see also Medda and Trujillo 2010, p. 286). Paixão-Casaca and Marlow (2005) made a first analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of SSS. Medda and Trujillo (2010) analyzed the advantages, disadvantages, and goals of SSS. In this paper, we have extended these strengths and weaknesses (See Appendix). The main conclusions that arise are: 1) the SSS strengths are mainly positive external effects, important to policy makers, and 2) the SSS weaknesses are mainly challenges in the price/quality ratio, important to companies. Therefore, the main challenge for SSS is to define options to improve its quality, reliability, speed, and price, in order to make it more attractive to customers.|$|E
40|$|The EU {{transport}} policy supports {{the development of}} the motorways of the sea (MOS) network as a priority axis of the Trans European Transport Network (TEN-T). In the general context of the EU {{transport policy}} and legislation, the Italian national authorities recognise the specific role of motorways of the sea links as one of the strategic action areas that can facilitate the mobility of freight. In this paper, {{the state of the art}} regarding the implementation of the MOS program in Italy is illustrated, with special regard to the services now in operation and the specific transport policy initiatives promoted by the Italian national authorities. Following the “Piano Generale della Mobilità”, published by the Italian Ministry of Transport in 2007, ports, together with airports and railway terminals, are included in the list of the so-called “international doors”, which are considered to be the most important nodes of the Italian transport network as a whole. The “Piano Generale della Mobilità” aims to encourage the development of synergies and to increase the level of integration between <b>lo-lo</b> and ro-ro services, which deploy more or less the same amount of capacity. In 2002 the Italian government promoted the so-called “Ecobonus” initiative. In 2004 it set up a new government-controlled company, Rete Autostrade Mediterranee (R. A. M.), with the specific task to support and co-ordinate actions for the development of motorways of the sea services at the national and European level. The Ecobonus is an incentive that the Italian national authorities offer to the trucking community in order to shift traffic volumes from road to motorways of the sea routes involving Italian ports. The Ecobonus accounts for up to 30 % of the price of the ticket and it is offered to those truckers who opt for the sea instead of the road, with a particular premium for truckers who reach a high number of trips/year (1600). This kind of premium aims also to enhance the pooling of small operators. Both national and EU routes to be promoted through the ecobonus initiative are identified by the Italian Law. In this work, for each Italian domestic and international scheduled MOS route, the operator, the weekly frequency, the average travel time, the sea distance and the price have been identified and reported. Nowadays, traffic volumes on Italian MOS represent 5 % of the total freight traffic volumes served by the Italian inland motorway system and an amount of 8 % is the target-value expected for year 2011. A total amount of 460 return trips on 79 routes are operated by 39 companies. The average route length and the average speed are equal to 536 km and 34 km/h respectively. The most important operator that serves Italian ports with MOS lines is Grimaldi Group Napoli, which accounts for the 13 % of the services in km per week. 24 Italian ports offer motorways of the sea services and Genoa, Ancona and Civitavecchia ports are the top three for km per week of scheduled MOS services. The price-distance functions for MOS services to/from Italian ports have been calculated, for a full-load 16 -metre-long truck. The price rises, as travel distance increases. Nevertheleses, distance explains only a part of the variance of price with respect to a linear relationship between price and route length and actually prices strongly depend on the particular shipping company that operates the line. It can be noted that, actually, no Italian domestic continental motorways of the sea line is in operation yet, despite the Italian peninsula is characterised by two quite long “natural” motorways of the sea corridors like the Tyrrhenian and Adriatic Seas. Indeed, MOS will effectively succeed to determine a modal shift towards waterway transport, only if they provide services whose quality and competitiveness are comparable to road transport. Both the efficiency of ports and the cruise speed are crucial elements for MOS lines to compete against road-only transport...|$|E
