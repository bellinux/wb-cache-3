Elizabeth Brundage, three years younger than her husband, was a trained soprano, a talent she exhibited for visitors to the Brundage home. She had {{a strong interest in}} classical music, one which may not have been fully shared by her husband, who said of a performance of Wagner's Die Walküre that it [...] "started at 7o'clock, at 10:00pm I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> watch and it registered exactly 8o'clock". She died at age 81 in 1971.|$|E

In 1985, {{he won the}} four-in-hand carriage driving competition at the Royal Windsor Horse Show in the United Kingdom and later was an honorary lifetime officer of the show. According to Sports Illustrated, Caspersen, described as [...] "portly and patrician, tall and splendidly erect, {{with a lot of}} beef in his jowls" [...] recalled being asked by Queen Elizabeth II at the awards ceremony about his role in driving his team of Holsteiners: [...] "I told her it was to lower the carriage's center of gravity,...

500|$|By {{the time}} the break began, Stump was the {{heaviest}} {{he had ever been}} and loathed the band's image as an [...] "emo" [...] band. Coming home from tour, drummer Andy Hurley [...] "went through the darkest depression [...] ever felt. I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> calendar and it was just empty." [...] Wentz, who had been abusing Xanax and Klonopin, was divorced by his wife Ashlee Simpson and returned to therapy. [...] "I'd basically gone from being the guy in Fall Out Boy to being the guy who, like, hangs out all day," [...] Wentz recalled. Previously known as the [...] "overexposed, despised" [...] leader of the band, Wentz [...] "simply grew up," [...] sharing custody of his son and embracing maturity: [...] "There was a jump-cut in my life. I started thinking – like, being old would be cool." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{finishing}} {{college in}} 1992, Welch and Rawlings moved to Nashville, Tennessee. [...] She recalled, [...] "I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> record collection {{and saw that}} all the music I loved {{had been made in}} Nashville—Bill Monroe, Dylan, the Stanley Brothers, Neil Young—so I moved there. Not ever thinking I was thirty years too late." [...] Rawlings soon followed. In Nashville, after singing [...] "Long Black Veil", the two first realized that their voices harmonized well and they started to perform as a duo. [...] They never considered using a working name, so the duo were simply billed as [...] "Gillian Welch". [...] A year after moving to Nashville, Welch found a manager, Denise Stiff, who already managed Alison Krauss. Both Welch and Stiff ignored frequent advice that Welch should stop playing with Rawlings and join a band. They eventually signed a recording contract with Almo Sounds. [...] Following a performance opening for Peter Rowan at the Station Inn, producer T-Bone Burnett expressed interest in recording an album. Burnett did not plan to disturb Welch's and Rawlings' preference for minimal instrumentation, and Welch agreed to take him on as a producer.|$|E
500|$|Between 1901 and 1903, Leno {{recorded}} {{more than}} twenty-five songs and monologues on the Gramophone and Typewriter Company label. He also made 14 short films {{towards the end of}} his life, in which he portrayed a bumbling buffoon who struggles to carry out everyday tasks, such as riding a bicycle or opening a bottle of champagne. On 26 November 1901, Leno, along with Seymour Hicks and his wife, the actress Ellaline Terriss, was invited to Sandringham House {{to take part in a}} Royal Command Performance to entertain King Edward VII, Queen Alexandra, their son George and his wife, Mary, the Prince and Princess of Wales. [...] Leno performed a thirty-five-minute solo act that included two of his best-known songs: [...] "How to Buy a House" [...] and [...] "The Huntsman". After the performance, Leno reported, [...] "The King, the Queen and the Prince of Wales all very kindly shook hands with me and told me how much they had enjoyed it. The Princess of Wales was just going to shake hands with me, when she <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> face, and couldn't do it for some time, because she laughed so much. I wasn't intending to look funny– I was really trying to look dignified and courtly; but I suppose I couldn't help myself." [...] As a memento, the king presented Leno with a jewel-encrusted royal tie pin, and thereafter, Leno became known as [...] "the King's Jester". Leno was the first music hall performer to give a Royal Command Performance during the king's reign.|$|E

500|$|Unlike the Browns, the Braves were contenders {{all the way}} to the end of the 1948 season. In a {{game against}} the Philadelphia Phillies on 3 September, and with the Braves tied for the NL lead, Heath hit a two-run home run and the Braves went on to win the game, 3–1, and stayed in first place for the {{remainder}} of the regular season. With the Braves up five games in the NL standings and four games remaining on their regular season schedule, the Braves had a match-up with the Brooklyn Dodgers on 29 September but according to teammate Clint Conatser, Heath asked Braves manager Billy Southworth for the night off but his request was denied. During the game, Heath attempted to score from second base and slid towards home plate to try and beat the tag by Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella. As he slid, his foot got caught in the dirt which caused his ankle to twist. [...] "I began to slide about five feet from the plate. Funny thing, I generally get my spikes up off the ground, but this time I didn't. I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> foot, which was twisted all the way around, and honestly I thought it would come right off", Heath said the next day from a local hospital. After playing in the majors for parts of 12 years, he would be forced to miss the World Series as it was later diagnosed he fractured his ankle. He called the broken ankle [...] "the biggest disappointment of my life." [...] A widely published newspaper photograph of the play showed Heath sliding toward the plate, mouth open in shock, with his leg bent mid-ankle with the lower ankle rotated ninety degrees to the upper ankle. He was quoted asking himself [...] "Why did I slide?" [...] when he was carried off the field on a stretcher and later put in an ambulance. In 1964, Heath said: ...|$|E

At the age of 19, while attending Wayne State University in Detroit, Ellison converted from Catholicism to Islam, later giving the following explanation: [...] "I can't claim that I was the most observant Catholic at the time [...] I had begun to really look around and ask myself about the social circumstances of the country, issues of justice, issues of change. When I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> spiritual life, and I looked at what might inform social change, justice in society... I found Islam." ...|$|E

2500|$|Green and McCreery [...] {{found that}} 14% of their 1800 self-selected {{subjects}} reported a purely auditory hallucination, and of these nearly half involved the hearing of articulate or inarticulate human speech sounds. An {{example of the}} former {{would be the case}} of an engineer facing a difficult professional decision, who, while sitting in a cinema, heard a voice saying, ‘loudly and distinctly’: ‘You can’t do it, you know’. [...] He adds: ‘It was so clear and resonant that I turned and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> companion who was gazing placidly at the screen I was amazed and somewhat relieved when it became apparent that I was the only person who had heard anything.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{awaiting}} sentencing, Madoff {{met with}} the SEC's Inspector General, H.

They never even <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> stock records. If investigators had checked with The Depository Trust Company, a central securities depository, it would've been easy for them to see. If you're looking at a Ponzi scheme, it's the first thing you do.

2500|$|He was a {{guest on}} The Howard Stern Show on April 10, 2008; {{when he was asked}} if he would direct Ghostbusters III and cast Howard, he said [...] "Do you know how many times I get asked if I want to do Ghostbusters III? Looking at my career so far, I mean, if you just <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> two films, I would make the most boring Ghostbusters movie. It would just be people talking about ghosts, there wouldn't be any ghost-busting in it." [...] Stern, a friend of Ivan Reitman, also {{revealed}} that he had seen Jason's early short films and was impressed enough to offer him the opportunity to direct an episode of Son of the Beach (a TV series he produced, a goofy parody of Baywatch), which Jason declined, citing that he was busy obtaining financing for Thank You for Smoking at the time.|$|E

2500|$|Cage {{returned}} to the United States in 1931. He went to Santa Monica, California, where he made a living partly by giving small, private lectures on contemporary art. He got to know various important figures of the Southern California art world, such as pianist Richard Buhlig (who became his first teacher) and arts patron Galka Scheyer. By 1933 Cage decided to concentrate on music rather than painting. [...] "The people who heard my music had better {{things to say about}} it than the people who <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> paintings had to say about my paintings", Cage later explained. In 1933 he sent some of his compositions to Henry Cowell; the reply was a [...] "rather vague letter", in which Cowell suggested that Cage study with Arnold Schoenberg—Cage's musical ideas at the time included composition based on a 25-tone row, somewhat similar to Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique. Cowell also advised that, before approaching Schoenberg, Cage should take some preliminary lessons, and recommended Adolph Weiss, a former Schoenberg pupil.|$|E
2500|$|Rumors and misquotes led to {{confusion}} as to {{what such}} a break truly meant; Wentz preferred to not refer to the break as a [...] "hiatus", instead explaining that the band was just [...] "decompressing". Fall Out Boy played its last show at Madison Square Garden on October 4, 2009. Near the end, Blink-182's Mark Hoppus shaved Wentz's head in a move Rolling Stone would later describe as a [...] "symbolic cleansing of the past, but also {{the beginning of a}} very dark chapter for the band." [...] By the time the break began, Stump was the heaviest he had ever been and loathed the band's image as an [...] "emo" [...] band.

2500|$|Tsar Nicholas II, {{the last}} Emperor of Russia, {{reported}} witnessing {{what he called}} [...] "a fiery ball" [...] while {{in the company of}} his grandfather, Tsar Alexander II: [...] "Once my parents were away," [...] recounted the Tsar, [...] "and I was at the all-night vigil with my grandfather in the small church in Alexandria. During the service there was a powerful thunderstorm, streaks of lightning flashed one after the other, and {{it seemed as if the}} peals of thunder would shake even the church and the whole world to its foundations. Suddenly it became quite dark, a blast of wind from the open door blew out the flame of the candles which were lit in front of the iconostasis, there was a long clap of thunder, louder than before, and I suddenly saw a fiery ball flying from the window straight towards the head of the Emperor. The ball (it was of lightning) whirled around the floor, then passed the chandelier and flew out through the door into the park. My heart froze, I glanced at my grandfather– his face was completely calm. He crossed himself just as calmly as he had when the fiery ball had flown near us, and I felt that it was unseemly and not courageous to be frightened as I was. I felt that one had only to look at what was happening and believe in the mercy of God, as he, my grandfather, did. After the ball had passed through the whole church, and suddenly gone out through the door, I again <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> grandfather. A faint smile was on his face, and he nodded his head at me. My panic disappeared, and from that time I had no more fear of storms." ...|$|E
