In 1985, they entered the mutual fund market with the PBHG Growth Fund. For its first eight years, the fund went largely undiscovered {{due to the fact that}} it was a <b>load</b> <b>fund</b> and was not marketed to the public. Its performance was impressive, however. The fund returned 46.6% in 1993, and rose 225% over the three years ending November 1993. [...] This performance came to light in late 1993 when the fund went no-load and received a torrent of media attention, beginning with the August edition of Money Magazine which declared that [...] "few people other than his clients recognize the name of today's hottest fund manager: Gary Pilgrim." [...] At a time when public awareness of mutual funds was rapidly increasing, Pilgrim quickly became one of the industry's most famous names. The fund continued to deliver very strong performance over the next three years - in the beginning of 1996, it had a three year annualized return of nearly 30%. At the end of June 1996, it was the #1 performer among all equity funds over the previous 10 years, according to Lipper Analytical Services. Meanwhile, the fund's assets under management had increased from about US$8 million in 1993 to US$5 billion in mid-1996. During Pilgrim's peak popularity in 1996, Sheldon Jacobs, the editor in chief of The No-Load Fund Investor, stated [...] "I have never seen a group that has done so consistently well."

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I examine {{mutual fund}} performance from {{the points of}} view of three distinct, but interrelated parties: individual investors, financial advisors, and the boards of directors of mutual fund companies. In the first essay, 2 ̆ 2 Comparing Fund Flow Sensitivity for Load and No-Load Funds Under Different Market States, 2 ̆ 2 I compare the flow-performance sensitivity of no-load funds and the three main classes of <b>load</b> <b>fund</b> shares, assuming investment advisors {{are more likely to}} guide the decision-making process of <b>load</b> <b>fund</b> investors. I find that load investors are more sensitive to raw fund return than are no-load investors. The flow to performance relation increases during good market states, but portfolios formed from the top performing funds after good market years actually tend to underperform during the following three years. 	In the second essay, 2 ̆ 2 Mutual Fund Performance and Board Characteristics Relating to Manager Terminations, 2 ̆ 2 I examine the timing of the decision to replace fund managers. I find that while returns and flows improve for those funds which replace their managers, very similar improvement is found in funds which do not terminate their managers. However, for mutual fund boards which do choose to replace a poorly performing manager, stronger board governance characteristics are associated with a greater probability of early replacement. 	In the third essay, 2 ̆ 2 Mutual Fund Performance in Extreme Market States, 2 ̆ 2 I examine performance of actively managed mutual funds separately for good and bad states of the market to test whether mutual funds perform differently under different market conditions. I find that the sample of funds performs 2. 3 percentage points better in good states over bad on a risk adjusted basis.

We also document a strong {{negative correlation between}} fund out flows and S&P market returns {{with the exception of}} outflows from a back-end <b>load</b> <b>fund.</b> These effects may be interpreted in two ways. Either investor supply and demand affects S&P market prices, or investors condition their demand and supply on intra-day market fluctuations. To sort out these effects, we examine trailing investor reaction to market moves. Our results suggest the market reacts to daily demand. However, only negative reactions appear due to past returns. We investigate whether index investor demand shocks are permanent or temporary by examining the related behavior of the S&P futures index. Clear evidence supports the hypothesis that they are permanent. This result may help explain the unusual recent relative performance of the S&P 500 index. Using the average market-timing newsletter recommendation over the period, we find that investors appear to react to "expert" advice about the market. Bullish newsletter sentiment is associated with greater inflows, although outflows are not well explained by newsletter advice. Dispersion in advice is associated with lower inflows. We find a high correlation among a number of variables used as a proxy for investor disagreement. ...|$|E

Prior {{research}} shows that mutual fund investors are often aware of up-front charges like sales loads, but they are less mindful of annual operating expenses, even though both types of fees lower overall performance. This study documents the historical trend and recent abuse of annual mutual fund expenses. As the industry becomes more adept at segmenting customers by level of investment sophistication, we claim that load mutual fund companies {{take advantage of this}} ability and charge higher expenses to their target customer: the lessknowledgeable investor.

The {{aim of this study}} was to measure glucose metabolism and microvascular blood flow in the skin during local insulin delivery and after an oral glucose load. METHODS: Microdialysis catheters were inserted intracutanously in human subjects. In eight subjects two microdialysis catheters were inserted, one perfused with insulin and one with control solution. First the local effects of insulin was studied, followed by a systemic provocation by an oral glucose load. Additionally, as control experiment, six subjects did not recieve local delivery of insulin or the oral glucose load. During microdialysis the local blood flow was measured by urea clearance and by laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI). RESULTS: Within 15 minutes of local insulin delivery, microvascular blood flow in the skin increased (urea clearance: P=. 047, LSCI: P=. 002) paralleled by increases in pyruvate (P=. 01) and lactate (P=. 04), indicating an increase in glucose uptake. An oral glucose load increased urea clearance from the catheters, indicating an increase in skin perfusion, although no perfusion changes were detected with LSCI. The concentration of glucose, pyruvate and lactate increased in the skin after the oral glucose load. CONCLUSION: Insulin has metabolic and vasodilatory effects in the skin both when given locally and after systemic delivery through an oral glucose <b>load.</b> <b>Funding</b> agencies: ALF grants; Region Ostergotland; Sinnescentrum; Gronberg Foundation</p...|$|R
