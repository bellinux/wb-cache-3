40|$|We {{present a}} robust {{framework}} for extracting <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> from point clouds. First, we show {{a novel approach}} to denoising the input point cloud using robust statistical estimates of surface normal and curvature which automatically rejects outliers and corrects points by energy minimization. Then the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> are constructed on the point cloud with controllable density. Our approach is applicable to surfaces of arbitrary genus, with or without boundaries, and is statistically robust to noise and outliers while preserving sharp surface features. We show our approach to be effective over a range of synthetic and real-world input datasets with varying amounts of noise and outliers. The extraction <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> information can benefit many applications in CAD, computer vision and graphics for point cloud shape analysis, recognition and segmentation. Here, we show the possibility <b>of</b> using the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> for feature-preserving mesh construction directly from noisy point clouds.

40|$|A {{classical}} result {{attributed to}} Joachimsthal in 1846 states that if two surfaces intersect with constant angle along a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> of one surface, then {{the curve of}} intersection is also a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> of the other surface. In this note we prove a global analogue of this result, as follows. Suppose that two closed convex surfaces intersect with constant angle along a curve that is not umbilic in either surface. We prove that the principal foliations of the two surfaces along the curve are either both orientable, or both non-orientable. We prove this by characterizing the constant angle intersection of two surfaces in Euclidean 3 -space as the intersection of a surface and a hypersurface {{in the space of}} oriented lines. The surface is Lagrangian, while the hypersurface is null, with respect to the canonical neutral Kaehler structure. We establish a relationship between the principal directions of the two surfaces along the intersection curve in Euclidean space, which yields the result. This method of proof is motivated by topology and, in particular, the slice problem for curves in the boundary of a 4 -manifold. Comment: 7 pages, 1 figure.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem in mobile robotics is {{the exploration of}} unknown fields that might be inaccessible or hostile to humans. Exploration missions of great importance include geological survey, disaster prediction and recovery, and search and rescue. For missions in relatively large regions, mobile sensor networks (MSN) are ideal candidates. The basic idea of MSN is that mobile robots form a sensor network that collects information, meanwhile, the behaviors of the mobile robots adapt {{to changes in the}} environment. To design feasible motion patterns and control of MSN, we draw inspiration from biology, where animal groups demonstrate amazingly complex but adaptive collective behaviors to changing environments. The main contributions of this thesis include platform independent mathematical models for the coupled motion-sensing dynamics of MSN and biologically-inspired provably convergent cooperative control and filtering algorithms for MSN exploring unknown scalar fields in both 2 D and 3 D spaces. We introduce a novel model of behaviors of mobile agents that leads to fundamental theoretical results for evaluating the feasibility and difficulty of exploring a field using MSN. Under this framework, we propose and implement source seeking algorithms using MSN inspired by behaviors of fish schools. To balance the cost and performance in exploration tasks, a switching strategy, which allows the mobile sensing agents to switch between individual and cooperative exploration, is developed. Compared to fixed strategies, the switching strategy brings in more flexibility in engineering design. To reveal the geometry of 3 D spaces, we propose a control and sensing co-design for MSN to detect and track a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> on a desired level surface. Ph. D...|$|E
