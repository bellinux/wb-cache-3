5|$|Pinnipeds have lifespans {{averaging}} 25–30 years. Females usually live <b>longer,</b> <b>as</b> males tend {{to fight}} and often die before reaching maturity. The longest recorded lifespans include 43 years for a wild female ringed seal and 46 years for a wild female grey seal. The age at which a pinniped sexually matures can vary from 2–12 years depending on the species. Females typically mature earlier than males.|$|E

All but Chapter 11 have the same titles in the second edition, but many are <b>longer,</b> <b>as</b> indicated by the page numbering of {{the start of each}} chapter. Bonner's abridgment shortened all the chapters, and removed some completely, again as indicated at the start of each chapter's entry below.|$|E
5|$|The raids {{ended in}} mid-1944 on {{the orders of}} Major-General Robert Laycock, the chief of Combined Operations Headquarters. He {{suggested}} that they were no <b>longer</b> <b>as</b> effective and only resulted in the Germans strengthening their beach defences, which could be detrimental to Allied plans.|$|E

5|$|In early April, {{the monsoon}} trough spawned a {{tropical}} depression early on April7 {{to the northeast}} of the Cocos Islands in the Australian basin. It moved to the southwest due to a ridge along {{the west coast of}} Australia, and quickly intensified into Tropical Cyclone Dianne. Favorable conditions allowed for continued strengthening, and the storm developed a small eye late on April7. The next day, the storm entered into South-West Indian Ocean and was renamed Jery. Shortly thereafter it intensified into a tropical cyclone, although by that time, the conditions were no <b>longer</b> <b>as</b> favorable for rapid intensification. On April9, MFR estimated peak 10‑minute winds of 150km/h (90mph); around the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1‑minute winds of 195km/h (120mph).|$|E
5|$|New York State Route210 (NY210) is a {{state highway}} in Orange County, New York, in the United States. It runs north from the New Jersey state line—where it {{continues}} south as Passaic County Route511 (CR511)—along the west shore of Greenwood Lake to the eponymous village of Greenwood Lake, where it ends at a junction with NY17A. It was once much <b>longer,</b> <b>as</b> it originally extended east along NY17A and CR106 in Orange and Rockland counties to Stony Point when it was assigned {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. The route was truncated to its current length in 1982. Prior to becoming NY210 in 1930, the road alongside Greenwood Lake was part of NY55, a route connecting New Jersey to Goshen, in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|On 13 December, von Frank {{informed}} Potiorek that {{he considered}} it impossible for Austro-Hungarian forces to remain in Belgrade for much <b>longer.</b> <b>As</b> a result, Potiorek ordered the Austro-Hungarian forces {{in the city to}} withdraw. The Austro-Hungarians left Belgrade on 14 and 15 December and retreated back into Austria-Hungary under the cover of their river monitors on the Sava and the Danube. The Serbian Army re-entered Belgrade on 15 December and was in full control of the city {{by the end of the}} following day.|$|E

5|$|On November 8, 1864, the {{regiment}} left their Front Royal, Virginia, camp for Martinsburg, West Virginia. They stopped near Winchester, Virginia, and {{voted in the}} presidential election. After a short period, 240 officers and enlisted men departed for Wheeling, West Virginia. These were {{the men who had}} completed their 3-year enlistment, and did not re-enlist. These men were discharged on November 28, 1864. Among those discharged was Lieutenant Colonel John J. Hoffman, commander of {{the regiment}}. General William H. Powell did not remain with the army much <b>longer,</b> <b>as</b> he resigned to attend to family issues. His resignation was reluctantly approved after a protest that the army could not afford to lose an officer of his quality, and he gave his farewell speech on January 10, 1865.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} sources of income in the {{territory}} during the 1850s was U.S. government annuity payments to the Ojibwe and other tribes required by earlier treaties. These payments amounted to more than $380,000 per year on average ($ in present-day terms) compared to approximately $120,000 per year ($ in present-day terms) given to the territory itself for development. Because of corruption, and mishandling of the payments to the tribes, {{a great deal of}} the money was used directly by U.S. settlers for commercial and community development with questionable benefit to the tribes. At the beginning of the Minnesota Territory, in fact, these payments were the territory's most important source of income since the fur trade was no <b>longer</b> <b>as</b> lucrative as it had once been and other exports were still negligible.|$|E
5|$|The Segaran {{lake area}} {{was the main}} complex of the Taman Sari during its era. This complex {{consisted}} of a man-made lake called Segaran ("artificial sea") with some buildings located on artificial islands {{in the middle of}} a lake. The buildings are connected by an underwater tunnel. It was used as the starting point for the royal family to reach the Taman Sari pools via a vessel. Today, the Segaran lake cannot be seen any <b>longer</b> <b>as</b> the water had been drained and the lake bed is now filled with human settlements. The underwater tunnel, which is now underground after the water had gone, still exist and can be accessed.|$|E

5|$|The Shelleys {{moved to}} Windsor {{in the summer}} of 1815. Hogg visited them there when his {{workload}} permitted. They left England for Continental Europe again in May 1816, and Hogg resumed his visits after their return, but he was no <b>longer</b> <b>as</b> close to them as he had been. This was in part due to his awkwardness with Mary, who was preoccupied with her efforts to finish writing Frankenstein. Percy and Hogg were nonetheless able to convince Mary to attend the opera with them on a few occasions.|$|E
5|$|Through Bar Sauma {{and other}} later envoys, such as Buscarello de Ghizolfi, Arghun promised the European leaders that if Jerusalem were conquered, {{he would have}} himself baptized and would return Jerusalem to the Christians. Bar Sauma was greeted warmly by the European monarchs, but Western Europe was no <b>longer</b> <b>as</b> {{interested}} in the Crusades, and the mission to form an alliance was ultimately fruitless. England did respond by sending a representative, Geoffrey of Langley, {{who had been a}} member of Edward I's Crusade 20 years earlier, and was sent to the Mongol court as an ambassador in 1291.|$|E
5|$|Christian {{communities}} grew {{quickly in}} many parts of the empire (and especially in the East) after 260, when Gallienus brought peace to the Church. The data to calculate the figures are nearly non-existent, but the historian and sociologist Keith Hopkins has given crude and tentative estimates for Christian population in the 3rd century. Hopkins estimates that the Christian community grew from a population of 1.1 million in 250 to a population of 6 million by 300, about 10% of the empire's total population. Christians even expanded into the countryside, where they had never been numerous before. Churches in the later 3rd century were no <b>longer</b> <b>as</b> inconspicuous as they had been in the first and second. Large churches were prominent in certain major cities throughout the empire. The church in Nicomedia even sat on a hill overlooking the imperial palace. These new churches probably represented not only absolute growth in Christian population, but also the increasing affluence of the Christian community. In some areas where Christians were influential, such as North Africa and Egypt, traditional deities were losing credibility.|$|E

5|$|Gatineau, Saskatchewan, and Qu'Appelle {{were used}} to ferry Canadian troops back home before they were placed in reserve in 1946 and {{subsequently}} sold for scrap, although Gatineau was scuttled in 1948 in British Columbia {{to serve as a}} breakwater. Faulknor and Forester were reduced to reserve in 1945 and broken up the following year; Escapade lasted on active duty a year <b>longer</b> <b>as</b> she served in the Anti-Submarine Training Flotilla until 1946, but the ship was scrapped the next year. Unlike most of her sisters, Fame remained on active duty until 1947 when she was placed in reserve. She was sold to the Dominican Republic in 1949 and renamed Generalissimo. The ship was renamed Sanchez in 1962 and finally discarded in 1968. Navarinon later became a training ship before she was returned to the Royal Navy in 1956 and broken up the following year.|$|E
5|$|Hoshino enjoyed drawing Lenalee's hair, despite {{finding her}} D.Gray-man {{character}} Yu Kanda's hair impossible to top. She enjoyed drawing Lenalee {{because of her}} personality, and her relationship with other series' characters such as Komui and Reever Wenhamm. Because her hair grew <b>longer</b> <b>as</b> the series went on, the author gave her different hairstyles. When the manga moved to Jump Square, a magazine for older readers, Hoshino decided to increase Lenalee's sex appeal by having her skirt shorter {{even though she is}} also wearing shorts beneath it. After Allen Walker became a fugitive from the Order, Hoshino wanted to have Lenalee chase after him, {{to the point where they}} would clash. When asked about Allen's farewell hug with Lenalee as he leaves the Order, Hoshino joked that she was happy with how Lenalee had matured, and at the same time become taller than Allen, in contrast to the beginning of the series when they were both the same height.|$|E
5|$|If the German {{air force}} had prevailed and {{attempted}} a landing, a much-reduced Royal Air Force {{would have been}} obliged to operate from airfields {{well away from the}} southeast of England. Any airfield that was in danger of being captured would have been made inoperable and there were plans to remove all portable equipment from vulnerable radar bases and completely destroy anything that could not be moved. Whatever was left of the RAF would have been committed to intercepting the invasion fleet in concert with the Royal Navy—to fly in the presence of an enemy that enjoys air superiority is very dangerous. However, the RAF would have kept several advantages, such as being able to operate largely over friendly territory, as well as having the ability to fly for <b>longer</b> <b>as,</b> until the Germans were able to operate from airfields in England, Luftwaffe pilots would still have to fly significant distances to reach their operational area.|$|E

5|$|In {{first-class}} matches during 1892, Peel scored 772 runs at 19.79 {{and took}} 121 wickets at 16.80. Additionally, in a non-first-class games against Leicestershire, he scored 226 {{as well as}} taking five wickets in Leicestershire's first innings. In the 1893 season, he took slightly more wickets at a lower average (126 at 14.51) but his run aggregate fell to 550 runs at 13.75. He {{was part of a}} successful Yorkshire team. The county won their first official County Championship title and the team was no <b>longer</b> <b>as</b> dependent on Peel with the ball—Ted Wainwright took more wickets than he did. The Australians toured England once again, but Peel played in just one of the three Test matches. He did not take a wicket, did little with the bat, and was left out of the team for the second Test. As the Australians had proved poor on the field, Lord Hawke withdrew Peel and Stanley Jackson from the team for the third Test so that they could play for Yorkshire. In 1894, Peel scored 699 runs at 16.25, failing to score a half-century. With the ball, he took 145 wickets at 13.44. During the season, he was awarded a benefit match at Bradford, which raised £2,000. The retirement of George Ulyett that season made Peel the team's senior professional, an important position at the time.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry firmly {{believed}} that throwaway clothes were {{the future of}} the industry, and this idea was incorporated into the costumes of The Motion Picture. William Ware Theiss, the designer who created the original television series costumes, was too busy to work on the film. Instead Robert Fletcher, considered one of American theater's most successful costume and scenic designers, was selected to design the new uniforms, suits, and robes for the production. Fletcher eschewed man-made synthetics for natural materials, finding that these fabrics sewed better and lasted <b>longer.</b> <b>As</b> times had changed, the Starfleet uniforms, with their bright reds, blues, greens, and golds, had to be revised: the miniskirts worn by females in the original series would now be considered sexist. Wise deemed the original multicolored uniforms too garish, and Fletcher {{believed that}} the brightness of these old designs would work against believability when seen on the wide screen—the designer's first task was to create new, less conspicuous uniforms.|$|E
5|$|Sasuke {{was also}} the most {{difficult}} character for Kishimoto to draw. He felt that his drawings tended to make Sasuke look too old, {{a result of his}} inexperience in drawing younger characters mature beyond their years. Sasuke's hair, originally kept short to save Kishimoto time, slowly grew <b>longer</b> <b>as</b> the series has progressed. Midway through Part I, Kishimoto drew a new costume for Sasuke featuring a number of belts strapped around his arms and legs, but because it took too long to draw, he returned to Sasuke's original costume design. Despite the time and energy Kishimoto spends drawing Sasuke, he has become his favorite character to draw. He ranked Sasuke alongside Sakura in terms of drawing difficulty. In some cases, his superiors even asked Kishimoto to redraw parts of the manga that did not illustrate Sasuke well.|$|E
