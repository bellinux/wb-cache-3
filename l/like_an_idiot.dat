[...] The Times stated that whoever {{thought it was a}} good idea for will.i.am to participate in the song ought to be [...] "locked in a windowless cell with nothing but those songs on a continuous loop". PopMatters, however, praised Thriller 25 and the remix of [...] "The Girl Is Mine". They wrote, [...] "Any album good enough to make you forgive (although maybe not forget) a song as bad as the Paul McCartney duet 'The Girl is Mine' has got to be damn good." [...] They added that will.i.am had put a [...] "breezy spin" [...] on the track and that the song's omission of McCartney did not suffer because of it.|$|E
500|$|When Lasance {{secured the}} role, he said [...] "Aden causes {{a bit of}} {{mischief}} in the Bay but he's really a good guy." [...] Aden {{has been described as}} a [...] "good looking guy with a smile that melts every heart." [...] Aden is initially portrayed as an [...] "anti-social bully with a huge chip on his shoulder" [...] where authority figures are concerned. Aden's mother died while he was young and he was raised by his father Larry Jefferies (Paul Gleeson). Aden is a keen football player, though Larry did not approve or support his ambitions. When Lasance returned to the serial in 2007, he described Aden as being [...] "an absolute bad-arse". When he read the scripts, he thought Aden seemed <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>idiot</b> and that viewers would take a dislike to the character. He added that Aden is a strong character and he enjoyed making him [...] "believable". Lasance said that he did not want Aden to turn into a [...] "good guy". The good thing about Aden is the fact [...] "he never quite shakes off the bad-boy image" [...] despite his [...] "different facets".|$|E

2500|$|Film critic Roger Ebert, who {{praised the}} first film, {{notes that the}} plot of the sequel was rather simple: [...] "The plot of Halloween II {{absolutely}} depends, of course, on our old friend the Idiot Plot, which requires that everyone in the movie behave at all times <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>idiot.</b> That's necessary because if anyone were to use common sense, the problem would be solved and the movie would be over." [...] Characters were described as shallow and like cardboard. Hill rebuffed such critiques by arguing that [...] "in a thriller film, what a character says is often irrelevant, especially in those sequences where the objective is to build up suspense." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{worker at}} DC Central Kitchen saw Tracht's apology on TV and heard {{his desire to}} show he was sorry. She thought that the [...] "Kitchen" [...] {{would be a good}} place for him to prove himself, and shared the idea with a co-worker who knew Rock Newman; he made a phone call. Soon, Tracht was mopping floors and {{cleaning}} bathrooms for four hours a day, several times a week. He volunteered for four months, laboring with unemployed and homeless people. Of the experience, Tracht stated: [...] "It's {{the kind of place where}} you can rediscover yourself. I did things I'd never done in my life. I went in there <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>idiot,</b> and now I know how to clean and mop, how to shovel and unload, how to slice and dice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other reviews {{were also}} {{critical}} of the episode's lack of scientific accuracy, mainly around Earth's moon. Writing for Slate, Phil Plait remarked, [...] "The science mistakes were so egregious and so obvious that they kept pulling me {{right out of the}} story. A lot of the mistakes were fixable with a simple Google search." [...] In his review for Doctor Who TV, Clint Hassell had a similar objection. While he praised both the actors' performances and the story's ability to [...] "examine aspects of the human condition", he said the episode was [...] "also terrible, presenting a version of science so incorrect that it almost creates a new genre – 'not-so-science fiction'". Though part of the fun of the show is [...] "obviously make-believe, sciencey-wiencey facts and jargon", he believed that, [...] "When [...] states blatantly wrong science 'facts' because the writer couldn’t be bothered to think rationally, or consult a scientist, that makes the Doctor look <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>idiot,</b> and...ruins part of the believability of the show." ...|$|E

[...] Kim Newman awarded it three out of five stars, stating [...] "every supporting character acts <b>like</b> <b>an</b> unhelpful <b>idiot</b> to keep the plot stirring, while yet again a seemingly all-powerful conspiracy seems to consist of two whole evil guys." ...|$|R
60|$|Then, {{there is}} the Diligence, twice or thrice a-day; with the dusty {{outsides}} in blue frocks, like butchers; and the insides in white nightcaps; and its cabriolet head on the roof, nodding and shaking, <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>idiot's</b> head; and its Young-France passengers staring out of window, with beards down to their waists, and blue spectacles awfully shading their warlike eyes, and very big sticks clenched in their National grasp. Also the Malle Poste, with {{only a couple of}} passengers, tearing along at a real good dare-devil pace, and out of sight in no time. Steady old Cures come jolting past, now and then, in such ramshackle, rusty, musty, clattering coaches as no Englishman would believe in; and bony women dawdle about in solitary places, holding cows by ropes while they feed, or digging and hoeing or doing field-work of a more laborious kind, or representing real shepherdesses with their flocks--to obtain an adequate idea of which pursuit and its followers, in any country, it is only necessary to take any pastoral poem, or picture, and imagine to yourself whatever is most exquisitely and widely unlike the descriptions therein contained.|$|R

6000|$|The orderly {{had gone}} {{about in a}} stupor all the evening. He drank some beer because he was parched, but not much, the alcohol made his feeling come back, {{and he could not}} bear it. He was dulled, as if nine-tenths of the {{ordinary}} man in him were inert. He crawled about disfigured. Still, when he thought of the kicks, he went sick, and when he thought of the threat of more kicking, in the room afterwards, his heart went hot and faint, and he panted, remembering the one that had come. He had been forced to say, [...] "For my girl." [...] He was much too done even to want to cry. His mouth hung slightly open, <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>idiot's.</b> He felt vacant, and wasted. So, he wandered at his work, painfully, and very slowly and clumsily, fumbling blindly with the brushes, and finding it difficult, when he sat down, to summon the energy to move again. His limbs, his jaw, were slack and nerveless. But he was very tired. He got to bed at last, and slept inert, relaxed, in a sleep that was rather stupor than slumber, a dead night of stupefaction shot through with gleams of anguish.|$|R

And he was like, 'I really want you to do this movie, you're doing this movie.' And I kept saying, 'No, no, no,' and he kept saying, 'How much more money?' And at a certain point I was <b>like,</b> 'I'm <b>an</b> <b>idiot</b> if I don't do it'. I should have been more focused on who the director was than what kind of trailer I got because... after the third week he stopped speaking to anyone on the set. It was difficult because here I am, I'm not an actress, and literally I would get zero direction. It wasn't the worst movie ever made, I've certainly seen worse, but it just didn't do well and people weren't that impressed with my performance." ...|$|R

Rebecca Bowden, of Yahoo! commented that during the episodes Callum is [...] "acting <b>like</b> <b>an</b> absolute <b>idiot,</b> and it's making me really start to hate his character", citing Callum's reaction to Holly's ordeal and his lack of care for others as her reason for this. Bowden felt that Callum's death was a shock, explaining that the graphic nature would not have suited the pre-watershed main show. She added that {{she was glad to}} see Callum die, although she commented that during the series he [...] "lost his personality for a little while".|$|R
