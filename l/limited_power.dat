5|$|After the war, Radford was a {{principal}} opponent {{to a plan}} to merge the uniformed services. A plan existed to split the Army and the Army Air Forces into separate branches and unite them and the Navy under one Cabinet-level defense organization. Fearing {{the loss of their}} branch's influence, Navy commanders opposed the formation of a separate Air Force and favored a more loose defense organization. Radford was picked by Forrestal to form the Secretary's Committee of Research and Reorganization. Months of discussion resulted in the National Security Act of 1947, a political victory for the Navy because it created the U.S. Air Force while resulting in a coordinated, not unified, U.S. Department of Defense with <b>limited</b> <b>power</b> and with the Navy maintaining control of its air assets. In 1947, Radford was briefly appointed commander of the Second Task Fleet, a move he felt was to distance him from the budget negotiations in Washington, but nonetheless preferred.|$|E
5|$|Harrison lost {{a bid for}} Senate in 1831, {{and found}} {{insufficient}} support to mount {{a run for the}} House of Representatives in 1832. His large family gave him money problems, and he remained out of public life in the early 1830s. By 1834, opposition to President Jackson was coalescing into {{what became known as the}} Whig Party. Harrison, though several years out of active politics was a war hero with roots in both North and South, and had been fired by Jackson. Thus, he looked attractive as a possible presidential candidate to the new party, something that Harrison did nothing to discourage. Harrison wrote a letter to the newspapers that won over many Whigs, assuring them of his fidelity to party principles, such as the <b>limited</b> <b>power</b> of the executive and federal subsidies for roads, canals and railroads.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the Durbin–Watson and several other tests for first-order {{autocorrelation}} have <b>limiting</b> <b>power</b> of either zero or one in a linear regression model without an intercept, and a constant lying strictly between these values when an intercept term is present. This paper considers the <b>limiting</b> <b>power</b> of these tests in models with possibly incorrect restrictions on the coefficients. It is found that with linear restrictions on the coefficients, the <b>limiting</b> <b>power</b> can still drop to zero even with the inclusion of an intercept in the regression. Our results also accommodate the situation of a possibly mis-specified linear model...|$|R

5|$|Scotland {{has limited}} {{self-government}} within the United Kingdom, {{as well as}} representation in the UK Parliament. Executive and legislative powers respectively have been devolved to the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood in Edinburgh since 1999.

The Scottish Parliament has legislative authority for all other areas relating to Scotland. It initially had only a <b>limited</b> <b>power</b> to vary income tax, but powers over taxation and social security were significantly expanded by the Scotland Acts of 2012 and 2016.|$|E
5|$|In the 1080s, Sélestat was the {{property}} of Hildegard von Eguisheim, mother of Frederick I, Duke of Swabia, {{the first member of}} the House of Hohenstaufen. Hildegard transformed the place into a religious centre when she founded St. Faith's Church, which she gave to the Benedictines of Conques Abbey. Monks from Conques opened a priory next to the church in 1092. The House of Hohenstaufen quickly became the leading dynasty of the Holy Roman Empire, which came to the imperial throne in 1152. Being under their protection, the priory of Sélestat strongly influenced local life. Even though Sélestat constituted a distinct parish, its priest had only <b>limited</b> <b>power</b> and the Benedictine prior was the true head of the municipality. At the end of the 12th century, the Hohenstaufen dynasty gradually lost power and as a result the priory started to decline. The citizens used this opportunity to reduce the prior's dominance and secure the power of their parish. They started to build a new parish church in the 1220s. St. George's Church was designed in Gothic style and was significantly larger than St. Faith's Church, another way to signify the end of Benedictine hegemony.|$|E

40|$|The {{peak power}} {{consumption}} of hardware components affects their power supply, packaging, and cooling requirements. When the peak power consumption is high, the hardware components or the systems that use them can become expensive and bulky. Given that components and systems rarely (if ever) actually require peak power, {{it is highly}} desirable to <b>limit</b> <b>power</b> consumption to a lessthan-peak power budget, based on which power supply, packaging, and cooling infrastructures can be more intelligently provisioned. In this paper, we study dynamic approaches for <b>limiting</b> the <b>power</b> consumption of main memories. Specifically, we propose four techniques that limit consumption by adjusting the power states of the memory devices, {{as a function of}} the load on the memory subsystem. Our simulations of applications from three benchmarks demonstrate that our techniques can consistently <b>limit</b> <b>power</b> to a pre-established budget. Two of the techniques can <b>limit</b> <b>power</b> with very low performance degradation. Our results also show that, when using these superior techniques, <b>limiting</b> <b>power</b> is at least as effective an energy-conservation approach as state-of-the-art techniques explicitly designed for performance-aware energy conservation. These latter results represent a departure from current energy management research and practice...|$|R
