5|$|The <b>low-pressure</b> {{oxygen and}} <b>low-pressure</b> fuel turbopumps were mounted 180° apart on the orbiter's aft {{fuselage}} thrust structure. The {{lines from the}} <b>low-pressure</b> turbopumps to the high-pressure turbopumps contain flexible bellows that enable the <b>low-pressure</b> turbopumps to remain stationary {{while the rest of}} the engine is gimbaled for thrust vector control, and also to prevent damage to the pumps when loads were applied to them. The liquid-hydrogen line from the LPFTP to the HPFTP is insulated to prevent the formation of liquid air.|$|E
5|$|Cyclogenesis is the {{development}} or strengthening of cyclonic circulation in the atmosphere (a <b>low-pressure</b> area).|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 is a {{high-bypass}} {{turbofan engine}} (most {{of the air}} accelerated by the fan bypasses {{the core of the}} engine and is exhausted out of the fan case) with several variants having bypass ratios ranging from 5:1 to 6:1, generating 18,500 to 34,000lbf (80kN to 150kN) of thrust. The variants share a common design, but the details differ. The CFM56 is a two-shaft (or two-spool) engine, meaning that there are two rotating shafts, one high-pressure and one <b>low-pressure.</b> Each is powered by its own turbine section (the high-pressure and <b>low-pressure</b> turbines, respectively). The fan and booster (<b>low-pressure</b> compressor) evolved over the different iterations of the engine, as did the compressor, combustor and turbine sections.|$|E
5|$|With a {{thrust rating}} of between 31,200 and 34,000lbf (139kN and 151kN), the CFM56-5C series {{is the most}} {{powerful}} of the CFM56 family. It powers Airbus' long-range A340-200 and -300 airliners, and entered service in 1993. The major changes are a larger fan, a fifth <b>low-pressure</b> turbine stage, and the same four-stage <b>low-pressure</b> compressor found in the -5B variant.|$|E
5|$|Air {{rises and}} rotates around a {{vertical}} axis, {{usually in the}} same direction as <b>low-pressure</b> systems in both northern and southern hemisphere. They are most often cyclonic, that is, associated with a localized <b>low-pressure</b> region within a supercell. Such storms can feature strong surface winds and severe hail. Mesocyclones often occur together with updrafts in supercells, where tornadoes may form. About 1700 mesocyclones form annually across the United States, but only half produce tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|On November 2, a trough of <b>low-pressure</b> was {{analyzed}} near the Lesser Antilles. The system moved westward into the Caribbean Sea without much organization. On November 7, the <b>low-pressure</b> area moved south of Cuba and became sufficiently organized {{to be considered}} a tropical depression with a pressure of at least 1010 mbar (hPa; 29.83 inHg). The depression moved over Cuba and into the Atlantic, where it dissipated the following day. On November 9, a second system was detected northeast of Bermuda with a pressure of 1005 mbar (hPa; 29.68 inHg), though it remained unclear whether the two systems were related.|$|E
5|$|The work {{split between}} the two {{companies}} gave GE responsibility for the high-pressure compressor (HPC), the combustor, and the high-pressure turbine (HPT); SNECMA {{was responsible for the}} fan, the <b>low-pressure</b> compressor (LPC), and the <b>low-pressure</b> turbine (LPT). SNECMA was also responsible for the initial airframe integration engineering, mostly involving the nacelle design, and was initially responsible for the gearbox, but shifted that work to GE when it became apparent that it would be more efficient for GE to assemble that component along with their other parts.|$|E
5|$|Along southeastern Lake Erie, {{near the}} city of Erie, Pennsylvania, a {{southern}} <b>low-pressure</b> area was moving toward the lake. This low had formed overnight, so was absent from Friday's weather map. It had been traveling northward and began moving northwestward after passing over Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|Improvements {{are due to}} its 61-inch {{titanium}} wide chord fan, 3D aerodynamics designed new {{core and}} <b>low-pressure</b> turbine with single crystal high-pressure turbine and Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC). Fan blades are reduced from 38 to 24 and it incorporates features from the CFM56-5 series such as a double-annular combustor as an option.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{oligonucleotide}} synthesis {{was carried}} out manually in solution or on solid phase. The solid phase synthesis was implemented using, as containers for the solid phase, miniature glass columns similar in their shape to <b>low-pressure</b> chromatography columns or syringes equipped with porous filters.|$|E
5|$|Indium(III) oxide and indium {{tin oxide}} (ITO) are used as a {{transparent}} conductive coating on glass substrates in electroluminescent panels. Indium tin oxide {{is used as a}} light filter in <b>low-pressure</b> sodium-vapor lamps. The infrared radiation is reflected back into the lamp, which increases the temperature within the tube and improves the performance of the lamp.|$|E
5|$|June 9, 2015: Just {{four days}} after Andres brought record-breaking rain to the Desert Southwest, another <b>low-pressure</b> system {{containing}} the remnants of Hurricane Blanca brought more record-breaking rainfall to many Arizona cities, including Tucson and Yuma.|$|E
5|$|Later that day, a {{low-level}} <b>low-pressure</b> area developed west of Wichita Falls {{at the intersection}} of a dry line extended southward across Central Texas and the stationary front extended eastward across the Red River valley. With the <b>low-pressure</b> system now in place, the air mass over the Red River valley became increasingly unstable, featuring surface temperatures near 90°F (32°C) and high dew points caused by the northerly surge of moisture induced by the subtropical jet. The combination of high temperatures and a moist atmosphere resulted in a favorable environment for thunderstorm development. However, despite the heat, temperatures alone were insufficient in breaking the capping inversionan area of warmer air aloft that prevents the relativity cooler air near the surface from rising. Instead, the approaching shortwave trough provided the impetus necessary to force convection to occur, allowing for the formation of showers and thunderstorms.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56-5A {{series is}} the initial CFM56-5 series, {{designed}} {{to power the}} short-to-medium range Airbus A320 family. Derived from the CFM56-2 and CFM56-3 families, the -5A series produces thrusts between 22,000 and 26,500lbf (98kN and 118kN). Aerodynamic improvements such as an updated fan, <b>low-pressure</b> compressor, high-pressure compressor and combustor make this variant 10–11% more fuel efficient than its predecessors.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Typhoon Amy {{can be traced}} back to a <b>low-pressure</b> area first {{detected}} over Kwajalein at 0500UTC on November29. Tracking westward, the Fleet Weather Center in Guam began to monitor vorticity for potential development, assigning the numeric designation 11122 to the tropical system. Late on December2, a routine weather reconnaissance flight unexpectedly intercepted the disturbance and detected unusually strong westerly winds, a characteristic typically indicative of a tropical cyclone. As such, the flight, named Vulture George, was rerouted to investigate the area. After finding conclusive evidence of a closed <b>low-pressure</b> area, the Fleet Weather Center in Guam classified the disturbance as a tropical storm with winds of 100km/h (60mph). At the time, Amy had two separate centers of circulation, resulting in an asymmetrical wind field.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{system that}} caused the tornado had {{produced}} severe weather, including two weak tornadoes, in eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey that morning. This was an unusual setup for a significant tornado, associated with a warm front near a <b>low-pressure</b> center. A thunderstorm cell formed south of Long Island around 10:20 am, and became a supercell sometime later after interacting with a surface <b>low-pressure</b> center. It turned north as a left-moving supercell, meaning it moved left {{with respect to the}} mean atmospheric flow. Left-moving supercells are very rare, as cyclonic storms usually turn {{to the right of the}} mean flow. It is unknown whether this leftward movement was due to an atmospheric interaction or terrain-induced movement, as the storm moved straight up the Connecticut River valley.|$|E
5|$|The {{subtropical}} {{storm had}} an unusual origin by forming from an interaction {{of two different}} systems near the Yucatán Peninsula. This occurrence is unusual, but not unique, as Subtropical Storm One in the 1974 season formed in similar pattern. A reconnaissance flight on June 17 reported that {{there appeared to be}} multiple transient circulations at the surface, but no well-defined center. The first disturbance {{can be traced back to}} June 15 in the northwest Caribbean Sea. The disturbance moved north, along with a <b>low-pressure</b> area that formed over the Yucatán Peninsula. A trough merged with the <b>low-pressure</b> area creating an even stronger trough over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Conditions in the Gulf of Mexico were favorable for tropical storm formation. Some severe weather had been occurring over the Florida Peninsula as early as June 16, as the fringes of disturbance moved across the Florida Straits and over the Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The {{thickness}} of the cylinder walls {{is directly related to}} the working pressure, and this affects the buoyancy characteristics of the cylinder. A <b>low-pressure</b> cylinder will be more buoyant than a high-pressure cylinder with similar size and proportions of length to diameter and in the same alloy.|$|E
5|$|When a {{tropical}} cyclone crosses the subtropical ridge axis, normally through {{a break in}} the high-pressure area caused by a system traversing the Westerlies, its general track around the high-pressure area is deflected significantly by winds moving towards the general <b>low-pressure</b> area to its north. When the cyclone track becomes strongly poleward with an easterly component, the cyclone has begun recurvature, entering the Westerlies. A typhoon moving through the Pacific Ocean towards Asia, for example, will recurve offshore of Japan to the north, and then to the northeast, if the typhoon encounters southwesterly winds (blowing northeastward) around a <b>low-pressure</b> system passing over China or Siberia. Many tropical cyclones are eventually forced toward the northeast by extratropical cyclones in this manner, which move from west to east {{to the north of the}} subtropical ridge. An example of {{a tropical}} cyclone in recurvature was Typhoon Ioke in 2006, which took a similar trajectory.|$|E
5|$|A tornado is a violently {{rotating}} {{column of}} air {{that is in}} contact with both {{the surface of the}} earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or, in rare cases, the base of a cumulus cloud. Also referred to as twisters, a collequial term in America, or cyclones, although the word cyclone is used in meteorology, in a wider sense, to name any closed <b>low-pressure</b> circulation.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm {{was believed to}} have formed from a <b>low-pressure</b> area, possibly on {{the tail end of}} a cold front on October 14. The storm moved westward; however, it began to curve west-southwestward on October 15, as it reached its peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). The storm continued to trek towards the west-southwest on October 16, later making landfall in eastern Florida on October 17 as a tropical depression. No damage is known to have been caused by the {{tropical storm}}.|$|E
5|$|An {{improvement}} of the CFM56-5A series, it was originally designed to power the A321. With a thrust range between 22,000 and 33,000lbf (98kN and 147kN) it can power every model in the A320 family (A318/A319/A320/A321) and has superseded the CFM56-5A series. Among the changes from the CFM56-5A is the option of a double-annular combustor that reduces emissions (particularly NOx), a new fan in a longer fan case, and a new <b>low-pressure</b> compressor with a fourth stage (up from three in earlier variants). It is the most numerous engine supplied to Airbus.|$|E
5|$|By early afternoon, the <b>low-pressure</b> {{area had}} moved east into Nebraska, while the warm front had moved northward into {{southern}} Minnesota. The atmosphere {{to the south}} of the warm front was strongly capped, meaning that the best chance of thunderstorm development was in areas along and slightly north of the front. By the time the thunderstorms started developing, CAPE values were 2000J/kg, indicating moderate atmospheric instability. Also present were low-level and deep-layer wind shear values of , respectively. All of these factors combined to create very favorable conditions for the development of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Centers {{of surface}} high- and <b>low-pressure</b> {{areas that are}} found within closed isobars on a surface weather {{analysis}} are the absolute maxima and minima in the pressure field, and can tell a user in a glance what the general weather is in their vicinity. Weather maps in English-speaking countries will depict their highs as Hs and lows as Ls, while Spanish-speaking countries will depict their highs as As and lows as Bs.|$|E
5|$|Compressor diving is a {{rudimentary}} method of surface-supplied diving {{used in some}} tropical regions such as the Philippines and the Caribbean. The divers swim with a half mask and fins and are supplied with air from an industrial <b>low-pressure</b> air compressor on the boat through plastic tubes. There is no reduction valve; the diver holds the hose end in his mouth with no demand valve or mouthpiece and allows excess air to spill out between the lips.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen {{is in the}} {{oceanic climate}} zone (Köppen: Cfb ). Its weather is subject to <b>low-pressure</b> systems from the Atlantic which result in {{unstable}} conditions throughout the year. Apart from slightly higher rainfall from July to September, precipitation is moderate. While snowfall occurs mainly from late December to early March, there can also be rain, with average temperatures around the freezing point.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{had long}} been an {{acquaintance}} of John Fitch, the first to build a steamboat in the United States, and the two had worked together on steam projects. The Oruktor Amphibolos was Evans's lone attempt at building his own steamboat powered by a high-pressure engine and Evans himself was often vague in appraising its capabilities. Yet Robert Fulton had found success with the North River Steamboat on the Hudson River in 1807, and thereafter steamboats became a reality. Although he used <b>low-pressure</b> engines, Fulton had in 1812 contacted Evans {{about the possibility of}} using Evans's engines, though that correspondence did not lead to the implementation of any of Evans's designs for Fulton's steamships. The Mississippi and tributaries experienced far stronger currents than eastern counterparts, and <b>low-pressure</b> steamboats lacked the power to counteract these. The Enterprise was the first viable steamboat to run on these rivers, and its designer Daniel French employed an adapted Evans' engine for the purpose. High-pressure engines became the standard on the Mississippi, though relatively few of those were actually built by the Pittsburgh works as Evans' patent on high-pressure engines was not widely enforced, and many other engine shops opened on the Mississippi that freely adapted Evans' designs for their own purposes.|$|E
5|$|In November2011, {{the first}} officially {{designated}} Mediterranean tropical cyclone by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) formed, christened as 01M by the Satellite Analysis Branch {{and given the}} name Rolf by the Free University of Berlin (FU Berlin), {{despite the fact that}} no agency is officially responsible for monitoring tropical cyclone activity in the Mediterranean. On 4November 2011, a frontal system associated with another <b>low-pressure</b> area monitored by FU Berlin, designated Quinn, spawned a second <b>low-pressure</b> system inland near Marseille, which was subsequently named Rolf by the university. An upper-level trough on the European mainland stalled as it approached the Pyrenees before approaching and interacting with the low known as Rolf. Heavy rainfall consequently fell over regions of southern France and northwestern Italy, resulting in widespread landslides and flooding. On 5November, Rolf slowed while stationed above the Massif Central, maintaining a pressure of 1000mbar (29.53inHg). A stationary front, stationed between Madrid and Lisbon, approached Rolf the same day, with the cold front later encountering and become associated with Rolf, which would continue for several days.|$|E
5|$|In meteorology, a cyclone is a {{large scale}} air mass that rotates around a strong center of low {{atmospheric}} pressure. Cyclones are characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate about a zone of low pressure. The largest <b>low-pressure</b> systems are polar vortices and extratropical cyclones of the largest scale (the synoptic scale). Warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale.|$|E
5|$|<b>Low-pressure</b> {{deposition}} of thin films of cubic boron nitride is possible. As in diamond growth, {{the major problem}} is to suppress the growth of hexagonal phases (h-BN or graphite, respectively). Whereas in diamond growth this is achieved by adding hydrogen gas, boron trifluoride is used for c-BN. Ion beam deposition, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, pulsed laser deposition, reactive sputtering, and other physical vapor deposition methods are used as well.|$|E
5|$|North Carolina is a U.S. state {{located on}} the Atlantic Seaboard in the southeastern United States. Tropical cyclones—storms {{characterized}} by a large <b>low-pressure</b> center and numerous thunderstorms that produce strong winds and heavy rain—regularly affect the state. According to statistical hurricane research between 1886 and 1996 by the North Carolina State Climatology Office, a tropical cyclone makes landfall along the coastline about once every four years. An estimated 17.5% of all North Atlantic tropical cyclones have affected the state.|$|E
5|$|The fan {{diameter}} {{varies with}} the different models of the CFM56, and that change has {{a direct impact on}} the engine performance. For example, the <b>low-pressure</b> shaft rotates at the same speed for both the CFM56-2 and the CFM56-3 models; the fan diameter is smaller on the -3, which lowers the tip speed of the fan blades. The lower speed allows the fan blades to operate more efficiently (5.5% more in this case), which increases the overall fuel efficiency of the engine (improving specific fuel consumption nearly 3%).|$|E
5|$|The {{flags and}} pennants point to the low pressure, so it is {{possible}} to determine at which hemisphere the station is standing. The barbs in the figure at the right are located at the Northern Hemisphere, because the wind is circling counter clock-wise around a <b>low-pressure</b> area at the Northern Hemisphere (the wind is blowing in the opposite direction at the Southern Hemisphere, see also Buys Ballot's law).|$|E
5|$|The <b>low-pressure</b> {{oxidizer}} turbopump (LPOTP) is an {{axial-flow pump}} which operates at approximately 5,150 rpm {{driven by a}} six-stage turbine powered by high-pressure liquid oxygen from the high-pressure oxidizer turbopump (HPOTP). It boosts the liquid oxygen's pressure from , with the flow from the LPOTP then being supplied to the HPOTP. During engine operation, the pressure boost permits the high-pressure oxidizer turbine to operate at high speeds without cavitating. The LPOTP, which measures approximately , {{is connected to the}} vehicle propellant ducting and supported in a fixed position by being mounted on the launch vehicle's structure.|$|E
5|$|The main factor {{behind this}} shift {{is the high}} summer {{temperature}} difference between Central Asia and the Indian Ocean. This {{is accompanied by a}} seasonal excursion of the normally equatorial intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), a <b>low-pressure</b> belt of highly unstable weather, northward towards India. This system intensified to its present strength {{as a result of the}} Tibetan Plateau's uplift, which accompanied the Eocene–Oligocene transition event, a major episode of global cooling and aridification which occurred 34–49Ma.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Cindy can be {{attributed}} to a deepening <b>low-pressure</b> area that tracked from the Great Lakes as a related cold front traveled southeastward and became stationary over the Atlantic, extending from northern Florida to Bermuda. On July 5, the front spawned a separate cut-off cold-core low off the coast of the Carolinas. This complex scenario resulted in the formation of a tropical depression later during the day, which slowly meandered north-northeastward. Tropical cyclones of this origin typically remain at a small size and evolve slowly, and Cindy complied to this pattern.|$|E
