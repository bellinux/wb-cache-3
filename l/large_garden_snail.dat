50|$|<b>Garden</b> <b>snails</b> can {{be easily}} {{controlled}} and trapped with a simple trap created by cutting a plastic bottle in half and burying the bottom half so the top is level with the soil, then partially filling the bottle bottom with any variety of beer. Snails are attracted to the carbohydrates and yeast in beer, and crawl into the trap and drown. This method requires that the trap be checked every day and dead snails removed and the trap refilled with beer as it evaporates over time. Traps should be spaced every three to four meters from one another for coverage of a <b>large</b> <b>garden.</b>|$|R

50|$|Rumina decollata is a {{voracious}} predator, and feeds readily upon common <b>garden</b> <b>snails</b> and slugs {{and their}} eggs. The snail eats plant matter as well, {{but the damage}} it causes to plants is considered minor {{when compared with the}} benefit of its predation on <b>garden</b> <b>snails</b> and other pest species of snails. Unfortunately it will also consume harmless local species of land gastropods, and beneficial annelids.|$|R

50|$|Oliva Lecoquiana are small, round snails. Commonly, they {{resemble}} <b>garden</b> <b>snails</b> {{with slightly}} more noodly heads. The shells are generally composed entirely of noodles.|$|R
40|$|The nutritive {{and market}} value of meat of edible <b>garden</b> <b>snail</b> from {{northern}} Turkey was deter¬mined. Protein, fat, ash, water and carbohydrate value of edible <b>garden</b> <b>snail</b> were found 9. 87, 0. 58, 1. 07, 82. 50 and 5. 99 % wet weight, respectively. The {{results of this study}} have showed that <b>garden</b> <b>snails</b> are good sources of amino acid, fatty acid, vitamins and minerals. The ly¬sine, isoleucine and leucine content from essential amino acids were 721, 467. 57 and 611. 50 mg/ 100 g, respectively. The major amino acids detected were aspartic acid (996. 814 mg/ 100 g), glutamic acid (1405. 158 mg/ 100 g), alanine (1063. 877 mg/ 100 g), serine (1039. 248 mg/ 100 g). Total saturated fatty acid, monounsaturated fatty acid and polyunsaturated fatty acid were de¬termined 28, 76, 20. 66 and 34. 38 %. The vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin B 1, B 2, B 3 and B 6 of vitamins were 5. 462, 0. 887, 0. 154, 0. 065, 3. 226 and 0. 288 mg/ 100 g wet wt, respectively.

50|$|The best-known species include Helix aspersa, the common, {{or brown}} <b>garden</b> <b>snail,</b> and Helix pomatia, the Roman snail, Burgundy snail, or edible snail. H. pomatia {{and some other}} species are eaten as escargots.|$|R
50|$|Helicarion australis can {{be found}} around Sydney in bushland and old gardens. Unlike the common <b>garden</b> <b>snail</b> Helix aspersa, they eat decomposing waste wood and fungus and do not eat fresh, growing plants.|$|R
50|$|Helix aperta, {{also known}} as Cantareus apertus, and {{commonly}} known as the green <b>garden</b> <b>snail,</b> is a species of air-breathing land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Helicidae, the typical snails.|$|R
25|$|According to some sources, the French {{exported}} brown <b>garden</b> <b>snails</b> to California in the 1850s, {{raising them}} as the delicacy escargot. Other sources claim that Italian immigrants {{were the first to}} bring the snail to the United States.|$|R
50|$|Ferric sodium EDTA, {{also known}} as sodium ferric ethylenediaminetetraacetate, is a broad {{spectrum}} molluscicide used to kill snails and slugs and protect agricultural crops and garden plants, and in particular to eliminate infestations of Cornu aspersum, the common <b>garden</b> <b>snail.</b>|$|R
50|$|Aestivation, also spelled estivation, is {{an example}} of {{consequential}} dormancy in response to very hot or dry conditions. It is common in invertebrates such as the <b>garden</b> <b>snail</b> and worm but also occurs in other animals such as the lungfish.|$|R
50|$|It is {{introduced}} in Israel and in Egypt since Roman times. It {{has been introduced}} into North America, including Phoenix and Glendale, Arizona, and other areas as a biological control agent, in hopes of controlling populations of the brown <b>garden</b> <b>snail.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractTerrestrial {{gastropods}} {{have become}} important economic pests attacking various vegetations in Egypt. According to this study, the molluscicidal activity of methomyl, urea, and copper hydroxide against the brown <b>garden</b> <b>snail</b> Eobania vermiculata {{and the small}} white <b>garden</b> <b>snail,</b> Theba pisana was investigated. The obtained results indicated that copper hydroxide was the most toxic compound against E. vermiculata followed by methomyl and urea after 72 h of evaluation where LC 50 values were 3. 31 %, 3. 75 % and 40. 88 %, respectively. Methomyl was also the most toxic compound when it was tested against T. pisana followed by copper hydroxide followed by urea. The LC 50 values were 3. 76 %, 4. 63 % and 40. 13 %, with respect. The brown <b>garden</b> <b>snail</b> was more susceptible to copper hydroxide and methomyl than the second one. There {{was no difference in}} the susceptibility of the two tested snails to urea. The toxicity of the compounds was enhanced as increasing the exposure time. This study showed that the land snails may be controlled using urea fertilizer at concentration of 8 %, to give % mortality in a range of (67 – 100) %...|$|R
5|$|Mating {{begins with}} a courting ritual. For example, in land snails of the genus Helix, {{including}} the escargot Helix pomatia, and the common <b>garden</b> <b>snail</b> Helix aspersa (also known as Cornu aspersum and Cantareus aspersus), copulation is preceded by an elaborate tactile courtship.|$|R
50|$|Heliciculture is {{the farming}} of snails. Some {{species such as}} the Roman Snail are {{protected}} in the wild in several European countries and must not be collected, but the Roman <b>Snail</b> and the <b>Garden</b> <b>Snail</b> (Cornu aspersum) are cultivated on snail farms.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} species in this family are valued as food items, {{including}} Cornu aspersum (formerly Helix aspersa) the brown or <b>garden</b> <b>snail,</b> and Helix pomatia the [...] "escargot". The biologies of these two species in particular have been thoroughly studied and documented.|$|R

50|$|The common <b>garden</b> <b>snail</b> (Helix aspersa) is herbivorous. These snails {{are able}} to digest most {{vegetation}} including carrots and lettuce. They also have a specialized crop of symbiotic bacteria that aid in their digestion, especially with {{the breakdown of the}} polysaccharide cellulose into simple sugars.|$|R

50|$|Like <b>garden</b> <b>snails,</b> Mertensia is hermaphroditic, {{reproducing}} sexually {{and occasionally}} asexually. Eggs and sperm are ejected {{into the water}} and from the fertilized eggs ovoid larvae develop. The planktonic larvae of this species are 2 - 3 mm long while adults grow up to 10 cm.|$|R
40|$|Monitoring {{undertaken}} {{during the}} first year of the white <b>garden</b> <b>snail</b> suppression program yielded useful information about residue levels and dissipation of metaldehyde and methiocarb in soil. Nonetheless, fall monitoring results though less variable than spring results were unable to accurately reflect the amount of pesticide applied at residential sites more than 65 % of the time. Pesticide granule size, application method, and sampling technique most likely contributed to the variable results. In addition, the large range in quality control analytical results from two participating laboratories increased the difficulty of interpreting our data. PART 1. Spring 1987 White <b>Garden</b> <b>Snail</b> Monitoring Program Two residential sites and two experimental sites were sampled over nine weeks and 20 days, respectively, to determine residue levels and dissipation rates of metaldehyde and methiocarb following their application to suppres...|$|R
50|$|Snail {{racing is}} a form of humorous {{entertainment}} that involves the racing of two or more air-breathing land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod molluscs. Usually the common <b>garden</b> <b>snail</b> species Helix aspersa is used. This species is native to Europe, but has been accidentally introduced to many countries all over the world.|$|R

50|$|Since its {{publication}} in March 1974 issue of Natural History an estimate {{for the highest}} speed of <b>garden</b> <b>snail</b> equal to 0.03 mph (1.3 cm/s) became popular.
