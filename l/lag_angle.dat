5000|$|A major {{advantage}} of the hysteresis motor is that since the <b>lag</b> <b>angle</b> δ is independent of speed, it develops constant torque from startup to synchronous speed. Therefore, it is self-starting and doesn't need an induction winding to start it, although many designs do have a squirrel-cage conductive winding structure embedded in the rotor to provide extra torque at start-up. [...] Hysteresis motors are manufactured in sub-fractional horsepower ratings, primarily as servomotors and timing motors. More expensive than the reluctance type, hysteresis motors are used where precise constant speed is required.|$|E

40|$|In a {{transformer}} for static converter, interrupted currents flow through its DC windings. The DC components of these current bias magnetomotive forces in respective magnetic cores of the transformer. Thus the iron cores are asymmetrically magnetized. To avoid various abnormal phenomena {{associated with this}} asymmetrical magnetization, we often use the so-called Greatz connection. However, even in this case {{a transformer}} is sometimes asymmetrically magnetized due to unbalance of control angles and variations of overlapping angles due to ripples of DC cur. rent. The performance of static inverter is greatly affected by the extent of asymmetrical magnetization. Conversely, this phenomenon can be utilized to improved the circuit characteristics and to facilitate the control of output voltage. This paper discusses the constitution of output voltage control system using the asymmetrical magnetization of inverter transformer and makes clear of its excellent characteristics in comparison with <b>lagging</b> <b>angle</b> control of rectifier generally used in these days. As the results of comperation, it has been pointed out that：(1) the respollse speed of asymmetrical magnetization method is higher than that of <b>lagging</b> <b>angle</b> control method；(2) the output voltage of asymmetrical magnetization method can easily be adjusted over the range of 10 ％, but that of <b>lagging</b> <b>angle</b> control method is adjustable from zero to its rated values, (3) the structure of asymmetrical magnetization control device is simpler than that of <b>lagging</b> <b>angle</b> control device...|$|R

40|$|We employ an {{approximate}} treatment of dissipative hydrodynamics {{in three dimensions}} to study the coalescence of binary neutron stars driven by the emission of gravitational waves. The stars are modeled as compressible ellipsoids obeying a polytropic equation of state; all internal fluid velocities {{are assumed to be}} linear functions of the coordinates. The hydrodynamic equations then reduce to a set of coupled ordinary differential equations for the evolution of the principal axes of the ellipsoids, the internal velocity parameters and the binary orbital parameters. Gravitational radiation reaction and viscous dissipation are both incorporated. We set up exact initial binary equilibrium configurations and follow the transition from the quasi-static, secular decay of the orbit at large separation to the rapid dynamical evolution of the configurations just prior to contact. A hydrodynamical instability resulting from tidal interactions significantly accelerates the coalescence at small separation, leading to appreciable radial infall velocity and tidal <b>lag</b> <b>angles</b> near contact.

40|$|The {{potential}} of photometric methods for {{the identification of}} l, the degree of spherical surface harmonic of a pulsating star, is investigated with special emphasis on Stromgren photometry applied to delta Scuti and gamma Dor variables. Limitations of actual model atmospheres when fine precision {{is required for the}} calculations of partial derivatives and integrals, which depend on limb darkening coefficients, are discussed. Two methods are discussed to calculate the phase <b>lags,</b> the <b>angle</b> between maximum temperature and minimum radius, and R, a parameter which describes departure from adiabaticity of the atmospheres of these pulsating stars. These quantities appear to be very dependent on the convection as parametrized by the mixing length theory. When one of the methods is applied to the gamma Dor stars gives phase lags close to 0 degrees, which are 90 - 180 degrees out of phase from typical delta Scuti stars. Examples are given for some High Amplitude Delta Scuti Stars (HADS) where the method can be easily applied and gives results consistent to interpret them as radial (l= 0) pulsating stars. Other low amplitude delta Scuti stars could be oscillating in a non-radial (l= 1, 2) mode.

40|$|Abstract—A {{method is}} {{proposed}} {{to simulate the}} propagation of a broadband ultrasound pulse in a lossy medium whose attenuation exhibits a power law frequency dependence. Using a bank of Gaussian filters, the broadband pulse is first decomposed into narrowband components. The effects of the attenuation and dispersion are then applied to each component based on the superposition principle. When the bandwidth of each component is narrow enough, these effects can be evaluated at the center frequency of the component, resulting in a magnitude reduction, a constant phase <b>angle</b> <b>lag,</b> and a relative time delay. The accuracy of the proposed method is tested by comparing the model-produced pulses with the experimentally measured pulses using two different phantoms. The first phantom has an attenuation function which exhibits a nearly linear frequency dependence. The second phantom has an attenuation function which exhibits a nearly quadratic frequency dependence. In deriving the dispersion from the measured attenuation, a nearly local model and a time causal model are used. For linear attenuation, the two models converge and both predict accurately the waveform of the transmitted pulse. For nonlinear attenuation, the time causal model is found more accurate than the nearly local model in predicting the waveform of the transmitted pulse. I...|$|R
