50|$|The Ludlow {{system uses}} molds, known as {{matrices}} or mats, which are hand-set into a special composing stick. Thus the composing process resembles that used in cold lead type printing. Once a {{line has been}} completed, the composing stick is inserted into the <b>Ludlow</b> <b>machine,</b> which clamps it firmly in place above the mold. Hot linecasting metal (the same alloy used in Linotype and Intertype machines) is then injected through the mold into the matrices, allowed to cool, and then {{the bottom of the}} slug is trimmed just before it is ejected. The operator then replaces the matrices, or mats, back into the typecase by hand. Since the mats are of a consistent height, irrespective of typeface size, they are easier to handle than lead type.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Ludlow</b> Typograph <b>Machine,</b> for casting of type-high slugs from hand-gathered brass matrices, {{was first}} {{manufactured}} in Chicago in 1912 and was widely used until the 1980s. Many {{are still in}} use and although no longer manufactured, service and parts are still available for them.|$|R
5000|$|After {{a line of}} type was {{assembled}} {{into the}} stick a special blocking slug was inserted to seal the end. Then the stick was placed mold side down into the slot on the table, a clamp locked down to securely hold the stick and the Ludlow activated. The plunger would snap down into the pot with considerable force, injecting molten type metal into the mold at {{a high rate of}} speed to ensure the mold was filled before the metal solidified. If the stick was not properly filled out or mounted firmly, or the special terminating block was forgotten, a dreaded [...] "splash" [...] would result, often encasing the operator's toes in molten lead and leaving a mess that needed to be peeled off the Ludlow surfaces. Operators were encouraged to wear heavy boots with steel toes and be quick at removing one. It was also not uncommon for some of the type metal to be projected up onto the ceiling, no matter the height. As with the Linotype / Intertype <b>machines,</b> the <b>Ludlow</b> <b>machines</b> were often fitted with metal feeders to keep the pot filled to optimum level.|$|R
2500|$|In the United States, Caslons {{became almost}} a genre, {{modified}} expanded with new styles such as bold, condensed, inline or with modifications such as shortened descenders to fit American common line, or lining figures. Many foundries cut (or, in many cases, pirated) their own versions. By the 1920s, American Type Founders offered a large range of styles, some numbered rather than named. (Bookman Old Style is {{a descendant of}} one of these American Caslon revivals. A series of modifications has given most modern Bookman digitisations a somewhat exaggerated appearance with extremely high x-height very unlike the original Caslon.) The hot metal typesetting companies Linotype, Monotype, Intertype and <b>Ludlow,</b> which sold <b>machines</b> that cast type under the control of a keyboard, brought out their own Caslon releases.|$|R
