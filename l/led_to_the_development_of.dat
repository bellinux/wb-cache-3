5|$|Astrology saw {{a popular}} revival {{starting}} in the 19th century, {{as part of a}} general revival of spiritualism and—later, New Age philosophy, and through the influence of mass media such as newspaper horoscopes. Early in the 20th century the psychiatrist Carl Jung developed some concepts concerning astrology, which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> psychological astrology.|$|E
5|$|Bangui {{serves as}} an administrative, trade, and {{commercial}} centre. During the Second World War the country became wealthier as exports of rubber, cotton, coffee, uranium and diamonds increased. After the war, the employment of local people in mainstream administration <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the country's infrastructure, which increased trade while slowing the national movement for independence.|$|E
5|$|Improvements {{to future}} {{development}} aircraft, such as swept wings {{and more powerful}} Pegasus engines, <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the Kestrel. The Kestrel was evaluated by the Tri-partite Evaluation Squadron, made up of military pilots from the United Kingdom, the United States, and West Germany. Later flights were conducted by the U.S. military and NASA.|$|E
25|$|Other applications, in {{particular}} coastal engineering, have <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>developments</b> of wind wave models {{specifically designed for}} coastal applications.|$|R

50|$|A design {{statement}} {{is a report}} required under English and Welsh planning law that sets out, illustrates and justifies the process that has <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> proposals. It is required to be submitted to accompany a planning application.|$|R
5|$|In the mid 16th-century Russians adopted {{printing}} from Central Europe, with Ivan Fyodorov {{being the}} first known Russian printer. In the 17th century printing became widespread, and woodcuts became especially popular. That <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> a special form of folk art known as lubok printing, which persisted in Russia well into the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Parathyroid hormone was {{isolated}} in 1923 by Adolph M. Hanson and 1925 by James B. Collip. Studies of parathyroid hormone levels by Roger Guillemin, Andrew Schally and Rosalyn Sussman Yalow <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> immunoassays capable of measuring body substances and a Nobel Prize in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{improvements}} in targeting and imaging have <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> stereotactic radiation {{in the treatment}} of early-stage lung cancer. In this form of radiotherapy, high doses are delivered over a number of sessions using stereotactic targeting techniques. Its use is primarily in patients who are not surgical candidates due to medical comorbidities.|$|E
50|$|However, {{environmental}} damage due to intensive agriculture, industrial development, {{and population growth}} have raised many questions among agronomists and have <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> and emergence of new fields (e.g., integrated pest management, waste treatment technologies, landscape architecture, genomics).|$|R
50|$|Mr. Lemnios {{also held}} various {{positions}} within industry at Hughes Aircraft Company, Westinghouse Electric Corporation and Ford Microelectronics, Inc. that <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> and demonstration of advanced microelectronic components.

5|$|Reconnaissance {{aircraft}} {{based on}} the M-1, the under-surfaces of the wing were covered with duralumin {{and it had a}} wider engine axis and longer engine nacelles. The demand for a reconnaissance aircraft {{based on the}} M-1 <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the P-1 variant.|$|E
5|$|Research in {{computing}} {{and computer}} science-related areas <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> many companies, including Symantec, the Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute, E-Trade, and Verbatim Corporation. Wireless technologies spawned Firetide and {{venture capital firm}} enVia Partners. Health systems research inspired Telesensory Systems.|$|E
5|$|Returning World War II {{veterans}} {{created a}} postwar economic boom, which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> huge housing developments targeted at returning veterans, the largest being Peter Cooper Village-Stuyvesant Town, {{which opened in}} 1947. In 1952, the United Nations relocated from its first headquarters near Queens, to the East Side of Manhattan.|$|E
50|$|In 1999 {{his wife}} Abbi was {{diagnosed}} with fibromialgia. This <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> two years later of a more comprehensive system of nutritional and physiological health that included sleep, hydration, and stress management, which became the system published in his first book, Body Confidence.|$|R
50|$|The {{report is}} {{considered}} <b>to</b> have <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> {{and evolution of}} health promotion, recognizing both the need for people to take more responsibility in changing their behaviors to improve their own health, and also the contribution of healthy communities and environments to health.|$|R
50|$|The local clay was {{suitable}} for making bricks, and North Kent is geologically rich in chalk, {{which is not}} found in many other places in Europe in such abundance. This <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> associated industries: water transport, paper, and cement; all of which continue today in the area.|$|R
5|$|Study of the {{structural}} colouration of the wing scales of swallowtail butterflies <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> more efficient light-emitting diodes. The structural colouration of butterflies is inspiring nanotechnology research to produce paints that do not use toxic pigments and {{in the development of}} new display technologies.|$|E
5|$|The sand whiting is {{a highly}} prized table fish often rated equal to the King George whiting, making it a common target for both {{commercial}} and recreational fisheries. The flesh is white, tender and has a moist, low oil content composition, making it easily digestible. Investigations into the aquaculture of the species began in the 1980s, and has <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> farmed sand whiting.|$|E
5|$|The terrain has <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> {{specialised}} frames, {{wheels and}} tyres. Punctures and other mechanical problems are common and often influence the result. Despite the esteem of the race, some cyclists dismiss {{it because of}} its difficult conditions. The race has also seen several controversies, with winners disqualified.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>development</b> of <b>the</b> A-12 {{was troubled}} by cost overruns and several delays, causing {{questions}} of <b>the</b> program's ability <b>to</b> deliver upon its objectives; these doubts <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> program being canceled in 1991. [...] The manner of its cancellation was contested through litigation until a settlement was reached in January 2014.|$|R
50|$|The William Hengerer Company {{originally}} {{sought to}} develop a location on this site in the early 1960s. This eventually <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> and opening of Seneca Mall in 1969 in direct competition <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Thruway Plaza. The mall at that time housed a large JCPenney store {{as well as local}} chain Sattler's.|$|R
50|$|In 1917 he {{was elected}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Geological Commission of Russia, and {{remained}} with it for more sixty years. During his tenure with the Commission {{he was responsible for}} directing research into palaeontology, sedimentology and stratigraphy, work which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> and extraction of resources such as coal, ores and petroleum.|$|R
5|$|An {{additional}} {{section is}} being constructed {{at the city}} end that will {{reduce the number of}} congested intersections buses must traverse to enter the Adelaide city centre; this is due to open in late 2017. The development of the O-Bahn busway <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the Torrens Linear Park from a run-down urban drain into an attractive public open space. It has also triggered urban development around the north-eastern terminus at Modbury.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism {{has also}} <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> mimicry {{complexes}} of Batesian mimicry, where edible species mimic aposematic taxa, and Müllerian mimicry, where inedible species, often of related taxa, {{have evolved to}} resemble each other, so as to benefit from reduced sampling rates by predators during learning. Similarly, adult Sesiidae species (also known as clearwing moths) have a general appearance that is sufficiently similar to a wasp or hornet to make it likely that the moths gain a reduction in predation by Batesian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1916, Canadian {{physicist}} Robert William Boyle {{and other}} scientists of the Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee (ASDIC) undertook research which ultimately <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> sonar technology. Acoustic sounding equipment was developed which could be operated much more rapidly than the sounding lines, thus enabling the German Meteor expedition aboard the German research vessel Meteor (1925–27) to take frequent soundings on east-west Atlantic transects. Maps produced from these techniques show the major Atlantic basins, but the depth precision of these early instruments was not sufficient to reveal the flat featureless abyssal plains.|$|E
50|$|Both methods {{result in}} a well-preserved {{approximate}} monolayer of cells, with a background devoid of blood and mucus. However, the current high cost of these patented, commercial systems required of cytotechnologists and pathologists in order <b>to</b> interpret <b>the</b> ThinPrep slides, which has <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> and evaluation of alternative, less costly methods.|$|R
50|$|Canada {{also has}} many {{bilateral}} agreements with various nations regarding green economy policies, including environmental cooperation agreements, {{along with a}} deep cooperation with the United States. The UNFCCC, is the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that was the overarching structure that <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> and ratification of the Paris agreement.|$|R
40|$|Metformin {{is widely}} {{prescribed}} {{for the treatment}} of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is associated with a reduction in diabetes-induced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Concerns about metformin-associated lactic acidosis (M-ALA) in patients undergoing contrast-based angiographic procedures have <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> and publication of a number of guidelines <b>to</b> improve <b>the</b> management of this patient cohort. 9488...|$|R
5|$|Christianity <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> a few {{phenomena}} {{characteristic of}} Byzantium. Namely, the intimate connection between Church and State, {{a legacy of}} Roman cultus. Also, {{the creation of a}} Christian philosophy that guided Byzantine Greeks in their everyday lives. And finally, the dichotomy between the Christian ideals of the Bible and classical Greek paideia which could not be left out, however, since so much of Christian scholarship and philosophy depended on it. These shaped Byzantine Greek character and the perceptions of themselves and others.|$|E
5|$|Euler also {{pioneered the}} use of {{analytic}} methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, analytic number theory. In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of hypergeometric series, q-series, hyperbolic trigonometric functions and the analytic theory of continued fractions. For example, he proved the infinitude of primes using the divergence of the harmonic series, and he used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way prime numbers are distributed. Euler's {{work in this area}} <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the prime number theorem.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{before the}} {{founding}} of BuroHappold, Edmund Happold, Ian Liddell, Vera Straka, Peter Rice and Michael Dickson established a lightweight structures research laboratory corresponding to Frei Otto's similar research institute {{at the university of}} Stuttgart. Ted Happold was the first to introduce ethylenetetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) as a cladding material, and the outcomes of the research carried out by the laboratory <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the designs for the Mannheim Multihall gridshell and a number of landmark fabric structures in the Middle East and the UK, allowing the new building forms to become generally accepted by architects and clients.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} winter {{service vehicles}} were snow rollers, designed {{to maintain a}} smooth, even road surface for sleds, although horse-drawn snowplows and gritting vehicles are recorded in use as early as 1862. The increase in motor car traffic and aviation in the early 20th century <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> and popularisation of large motorised winter service vehicles.|$|R
50|$|After {{the success}} of the Hib vaccine, Schneerson and Robbins {{continued}} their work on single antigens and conjugate vaccines. Their efforts <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> and licensing of vaccines against pertussis (whooping cough), typhoid, Staphylococcus infections (pneumonia, aureus, and Group B), certain types of malaria, and anthrax. Additional information about their more recent research is available at http://2012annualreport.nichd.nih.gov/pdmi.html.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the Guyandotte Valley Railroad Company's diligent work, the rich timber and coal regions of the Guyandotte Valley were better {{connected}} to larger markets. It <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> or growth of such towns as West Hamlin, Branchland, Midkiff, Brady, Ranger, Gill, Sand Creek, Atenville, Eden Park, Harts, Ferrellsburg, Green Shoal, and Big Creek.|$|R
