This coaxial cavity essentially {{has a direct}} short connection {{at one end and}} is connected with several <b>lumped</b> <b>capacitances</b> at the other end. The key technology of the resonator is the usage of multiple evanescent-modes of TM (transverse magnetic wave) modes. Due to the combined effects of the evanescent mode and multiple modes, the size of the resonator is greatly reduced. In this paper, the theory of resonator is discussed in detail. To verify the correctness of operation, the resonator is used in experimental measurements conducted to realize a third-order band-pass filter based on SIW (substrate-integrated waveguide) technology.

Miniaturized artificial magnetic conductor surfaces (AMCs) are designed using capacitance loaded metal patches with individual elements measuring just λ/ 70. Placing the SRR above the AMC improves the bandwidth to between 1. 5 and 3. 5 % dependent on the overall size of the AMC and produces a platform tolerant antenna measuring 0. 11 λ × 0. 17 λ × 0. 019 λ.

In this model circuit, cavities and solid dielectric parts are represented as <b>lumped</b> <b>capacitances,</b> while the resistance and the inductance of the test voltage source are taken into consideration. By using a version of the Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP), the waveforms of the voltage across the two cavities, {{as well as those of}} the voltage across the neighbouring parts of the solid dielectric, have been traced, and the transient voltage stressing of these parts has been analysed for repetitive discharges in the two cavities...|$|R

50|$|In 1967 Ulrich {{showed that}} the optical {{transmission}} properties of a metallic mesh can be modeled by considering the mesh to be a simple circuit element on a free space transmission line. To develop the theory of metallic meshes, he focused on the properties of two types of mesh structure: a metallic grid with square openings; and a grid of metallic squares supported on a thin dielectric substrate. Using the transmission line method, he then modeled the behavior {{of each of these}} meshes as either lumped inductance (square openings) or a <b>lumped</b> <b>capacitance</b> (free-standing squares). These two types of meshes are commonly referred to as inductive or capacitive meshes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lumped</b> <b>capacitance</b> {{model is}} a common {{approximation}} in transient conduction, which may be used whenever heat conduction within an object is much faster than heat transfer across the boundary of the object. The method of approximation then suitably reduces {{one aspect of the}} transient conduction system (spatial temperature variation within the object) to a more mathematically tractable form (that is, it is assumed that the temperature within the object is completely uniform in space, although this spatially uniform temperature value changes over time). The rising uniform temperature within the object or part of a system, can then be treated like a capacitative reservoir which absorbs heat until it reaches a steady thermal state in time (after which temperature does not change within it).|$|E
40|$|Wireless power {{transfer}} via magnetic resonant coupling is experimentally demonstrated {{in a system}} with a large source coil and either one or two small receivers. Resonance between source and load coils is achieved with lumped capacitors terminating the coils. A circuit model is developed to describe the system with a single receiver, and extended to describe the system with two receivers. With parameter values chosen to obtain good fits, the circuit models yield transfer frequency responses that are in good agreement with experimental measurements over a range of frequencies that span the resonance. Resonant frequency splitting is observed experimentally and described theoretically for the multiple receiver system. In the single receiver system at resonance, more than 50 % of the power that is supplied by the actual source is delivered to the load. In a multiple receiver system, a means for tracking frequency shifts and continuously retuning the <b>lumped</b> <b>capacitances</b> that terminate each receiver coil so as to maximize efficiency is a key issue for future work...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a low to middle order finite volume/lumped {{capacitance}} thermal model of an electric machine and the correction of critical parameters. The {{different parts of the}} electric machine are divided into sub-volumes called finite volumes or <b>lumped</b> <b>capacitances.</b> From the given characteristic geometry of the electric machine, the thermal resistances to create the system matrix are calculated.

In a second step an experiment with time dependent current in the stator windings is done. The experiment then is simulated with the time dependent current measured in the experiment using the correction parameters found in the first step.

The service is defined by a 15 minute power modulation, upward or downward, followed by a payback of one hour and 15 minutes.

The potential amount of modulable power and the payback effect are computed by solving mixed integer linear problems. Within these problems, the building thermal behavior is modeled by an equivalent thermal network made of resistances and <b>lumped</b> <b>capacitances</b> whose parameters are identified from validated models. Simulations are performed on 100 freestanding houses. For an average 4. 3 kW heat pump, results show a potential of 1. 2 kW upward modulation with a payback of 600 Wh and 150 Wh of overconsumption.

5000|$|Occasionally, {{transient}} conduction {{problems may}} be considerably simplified if {{regions of the}} object being heated or cooled can be identified, for which thermal conductivity is very much greater than that for heat paths leading into the region. In this case, the region with high conductivity can often be treated in the <b>lumped</b> <b>capacitance</b> model, as a [...] "lump" [...] of material with a simple thermal capacitance consisting of its aggregate heat capacity. Such regions warm or cool, but show no significant temperature variation across their extent, during the process (as compared {{to the rest of}} the system). This is due to their far higher conductance. During transient conduction, therefore, the temperature across their conductive regions changes uniformly in space, and as a simple exponential in time. An example of such systems are those that follow Newton's law of cooling during transient cooling (or the reverse during heating). The equivalent thermal circuit consists of a simple capacitor in series with a resistor. In such cases, the remainder of the system with high thermal resistance (comparatively low conductivity) plays the role of the resistor in the circuit.|$|E

40|$|A {{large scale}} {{collective}} system implementing a specific model for associative memory {{was described by}} Hopfield [1]. A circuit model for this operation is illustrated in Figure 1, and consists of three major components. A collection of active gain elements (called amplifiers or "neurons") with gain function V = g(v) are connected by a passive interconnect matrix which provides unidirectional excitatory or inhibitory connections ("synapses") between the output of one neuron and the input to another. The strength of this interconnection is given by the conductance G_(ij) = G_ 0 T_(ij). The requirements placed on the gain function g(v) are not very severe [2], and easily met by VLSI-realizable amplifiers.
