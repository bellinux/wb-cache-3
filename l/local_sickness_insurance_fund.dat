50|$|Austria's health {{programs}} are <b>funded</b> by the <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>fund</b> {{known as the}} Krankenkasse, which in 2013 took 11.0% of the GDP, which was above {{the average of the}} E.U average of 7.8% of GDP. Austria's healthcare system is decentralized, and operates with a system similar to United States federalism. Each of the nine provinces and the federal government of Austria have legal limitation and roles in their healthcare system. Federal Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs is the federal aspect, its role is to develop the framework for the services that are offered, and handle the <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>fund</b> known as the Krankenkasse, which funds Austria's healthcare system. The role of the Provinces is to manage and provide the care as needed. Since Austria's health program covers a vast array of social insurance including but not limited to unemployment insurance, family benefits, accident insurance, the overall bureaucracy is vast. While the Krankenkasse is the primary fund, Austria social protection network actually implemented by 22 smaller funds, 19 of which are purely for sickness and all of which by public law are self-governed in order to insure decentralization.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: According to Progressive reformers, {{private health}} {{insurance}} had failed to protect sick workers {{and needed to be}} replaced by compulsory government insurance. Their opponents claimed that sick pay benefits induced an absenteeism moral hazard that presaged disaster if states adopted Progressive insurance proposals. Progressives denied the existence of such a moral hazard. This essay uses worker and sickness fund surveys to test the veracity of these competing claims. It finds evidence of a sick pay moral hazard that was counterbalanced by medical control over absence duration. Overall, private <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>funds</b> capably provided income protection for covered workers...|$|R

With permanent headquarters, the club became a focal point for member interests and business. The association provided a variety of services to its members, including in 1914-15 the provision of a purpose-built Sample Rooms Building, now demolished, on an adjacent site fronting Charlotte Street, acquired in 1913. The CTA negotiated discounts for commercial travellers at hotels throughout the state, and was affiliated with the United Travellers Association of Australasia. As well, it provided services such as mortuary <b>funds,</b> accident and <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>funds,</b> assistance with loans, scholarships for members' children, savings funds, allowances for needy members, and an employment register for out of work commercial travellers.|$|R
40|$|Although {{an inverse}} {{relationship}} between sickness absence and unemployment has been documented {{in a number of}} studies using either quarterly or annual data from different countries with varying institutional frameworks, it is not yet clear whether this empirical regularity is due to changes in the individual costs of absence when unemployment increases (incentive effect) or, alternatively, to changes in the composition of the workforce over the business cycle (selection effect). In order to provide evidence to evaluate the relative importance of both effects we first investigate the effects of changes in the unemployment benefit entitlement system with monthly absence data for East and West Germany for the years 1991 - 2004. Second, we analyze the impact of differences in the costs of unemployment on the annual absence rates of workers in different <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>funds</b> using state-level annual absence rates for the years 1993 - 2004. We find clear evidence in favor of an incentive effect...|$|R
40|$|Identifying, separating, and {{managing}} asymmetric information in early 20 c health insurance The existing literature on insurance contracts emphasizes {{the difficulty of}} separating evidence of moral hazard from that showing adverse selection. Contrary to theoretical and intuitive expectations, little empirical evidence of asymmetric information has emerged. This paper surmounts the difficulties of separate testing for each kind of adverse selection by using historical data on master contracts for {{a large number of}} group health policies. Not only did each problem appear in testing, but contemporary publications indicated awareness of those problems and of their potential solutions. Having shown that each condition existed, the paper then considers how <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>funds</b> managed each problem. Longer probationary periods before applicants became covered reduced adverse selection. Longer waiting periods before claimants could receive benefits reduced the moral hazard of paid sick leave. These findings support previous claims of the fundamental institutional soundness of early forms of health insurance...|$|R
30|$|The 1992 Health Structure Act (Gesundheitsstrukturgesetz), legislated by an {{informal}} grand coalition (the opposition SPD participated in formulating the legislation), changed the parameters governing decision-making {{about health care}} by introducing top-down steering instruments such as limits on the numbers of physicians allowed to participated in statutory health care provision and budget caps. The reform also allowed free choice of <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>fund,</b> thereby weakening one of the sickness funds’ sources of organization strength. With the SPD on board at an early stage, passage in the SPD dominated Bundesrat was assured. The 1996 Law to Decrease Contributions built on this orientation by proposing additional modest reductions in reimbursements for dental care, higher co-payments for prescription drugs, and other incremental reductions. The legislation was based on intensive negotiations with the SPD {{as part of the}} bipartisan Alliance for Jobs; controlling health care costs was seen as a way to reduce non-wage labor costs and boost employment. The SPD was divided about whether to accept deteriorations, but opted to support the legislation {{in order to reduce the}} cost of labor (Jochem 2009).|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study, carried out in 1995, was to determine, using {{available}} sources, the cost of peripheral arterial obliterative disease (PAOD) in France over a 1 -year period. This cost-of-illness study {{was based on a}} retrospective analysis of the available literature and databases. It involved a description of epidemiological data and a cost estimate of the different medical resources consumed over 1 year. For this latter purpose, a payer perspective was chosen. Data were extracted from national representative surveys and databases with respect to morbidity and mortality [from the National Institute of Health and Medical Research (Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale; INSERM) and the National <b>Sickness</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Fund</b> for Salaried People (Caisse Nationale dAssurance Maladie des Travailleurs Salaries; CNAMTS) ], consultations, examination tests and drug prescriptions [from the French Medical Audit conducted by Intercontinental Medical Statistics (IMS) ], hospitalisations [from the Statistical Unit of the Department of Health - Service des Statistiques, des Etudes et des Systemes dInformation (SESI) and the National Public Research Centre in Health Economics (Centre de Recherche dEtude et de Documentation en Economie de la Sante; CREDES) ] and related health expenditure from CNAMTS. In France, the prevalence of stage II PAOD (Leriche and Fontaine classification) in 1992 was estimated to be 675 000; 53 % of these patients had undergone vascular or bypass surgery. The total annual cost of healthcare (including consultations, drugs, laboratory tests, hospitalisation and hydrotherapy) for the management of patients with PAOD ranged from 3. 9 billion French francs (F) to F 4. 6 billion (1995 values), {{depending on the type of}} hospital considered. 50 % of this cost was related to hospitalisations and 75 % was covered by the CNAMTS. Although this study was only a partial evaluation and did not take into account indirect costs or nonmedical direct costs, such as transport and care by healthcare assistants and paramedics, these results may help to establish public health priorities and modify clinical practice to favour an earlier diagnosis of PAOD.

50|$|All persons {{resident}} in Finland {{for more than}} a short time were eligible for benefits. Foreigners had to register with the local health authorities to receive payments. In the 1980s, the daily payment made to make up for losses of income due to illness averaged about 80 percent of a typical wage and could last for as many as 300 workdays. Highly paid individuals received less. Hospital care in public hospitals was generally free, and other compensation amounted to 60 percent of doctors' fees, 75 percent of laboratory expenses, and 50 percent of medicine costs. In the mid-1980s, dental care was free for anyone born after 1961, but for others it was paid only if dental problems had to be treated to cure a disease. Maternity leave payments amounted to about 80 percent of income for about one year, and could begin five weeks before the estimated date of the birth. Fathers could take some of this time, with a corresponding cut in the days allowed to the mother. <b>Sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> was <b>funded</b> by the recipients themselves through their payment of about 2 percent of their locally taxable income, by employers who paid a contribution of about 1 percent of the employee's wages, and by the state.|$|R

This law also introduced a new type of <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> benefit, namely facilities for the early diagnosis of disease. Apart from the discretionary service of disease prevention which had existed since 1923, insured persons now had a right in certain circumstances to medical examinations aimed at the early diagnosis of disease.
