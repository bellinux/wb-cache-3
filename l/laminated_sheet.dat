40|$|The {{subject of}} {{improving}} the formability and fracture resistance of coated and <b>laminated</b> <b>sheets,</b> and sandwiches during forming and in service has received significant attention because these properties constitute an important design criterion for these composite materials.

Major failure mechanisms are identified in the <b>laminated</b> <b>sheets</b> during forming and in sandwiched sheets when subjected to static and dynamic loading. Shape futability of coated and <b>laminated</b> <b>sheets</b> after forming are also discussed in terms of the surface friction and shear deformation in the core layer.

50|$|In West Germany an {{improved}} identity card {{was developed in}} the 1980s and issued from April 1987 on. The card consisted of a single <b>laminated</b> <b>sheet</b> of paper with a machine-readable zone. To prevent counterfeiting, it contained watermarks, guillochés, microprinting, fluorescent dyes, and multi-colour fluorescent fibres. In addition, the holder's name was laser engraved into the plastic film and the holder's picture was printed on the document, so it could not be removed and replaced by a different one (unlike the older ID cards, where the picture was just glued to the document).|$|E
50|$|A bed {{of nails}} tester is a {{traditional}} electronic test fixture which has numerous pins inserted into holes in an epoxy phenolic glass cloth <b>laminated</b> <b>sheet</b> (G-10) which are aligned using tooling pins {{to make contact with}} test points on a printed circuit board and are also connected to a measuring unit by wires. Named by analogy with a real-world bed of nails, these devices contain an array of small, spring-loaded pogo pins; each pogo pin makes contact with one node in the circuitry of the DUT (device under test). By pressing the DUT down against the bed of nails, reliable contact can be quickly and simultaneously made with hundreds or even thousands of individual test points within the circuitry of the DUT. The hold-down force may be provided manually or by means of a vacuum or a mechanical presser, thus pulling the DUT downwards onto the nails.|$|E
50|$|For {{thickness}} above 0.093” {{and up to}} 0.375”, {{a discrete}} <b>laminated</b> <b>sheet</b> (similar in size (l x w) to plywood) was produced by the cutdown process. The cutdown sheets were racked and moved from vat to vat by overhead tracked cranes. Each vat was successively less concentrated until the desired 0.05% was reached. The thicker the material, the longer it took to leach the zinc chloride to 0.05%. For the thickest products, times of 18 months to 2 years were needed. The zinc chloride used in these processes was {{for the most part}} not consumed in achieving the desired bonding. Indeed any dilution of the zinc chloride resulting from the leaching was dealt with by using evaporators to bring the zinc chloride solution back to the 70 Baume needed for using it again for saturating. In a sense, zinc chloride {{can be thought of as}} a catalyst in the making of the vulcanized fibre.|$|E

40|$|The {{magnetic}} flux leakage (MFL) technique is most commonly used for crack detection from iron bars, <b>laminated</b> <b>sheets,</b> and steel tubes of ferromagnetic nature. Magnetic flux leakage system induces a magnetic field and detects {{magnetic flux}} lines that “leak” or change because of a discontinuity in the magnetized area. An inductive coil sensor or a Hall effect sensor detects the leakage. Magnetic methods of nondestructive testing (NDT) depend on detecting this {{magnetic flux leakage}} field. The ferromagnetic specimen is magnetized by suitable methods, and flaws which break the surface or just the subsurface distort the magnetic field, causing local flux leakage fields.

5000|$|Starting around 1725 in Europe, gilded papier-mâché {{began to}} appear as a {{low-cost}} alternative to similarly treated plaster or carved wood in architecture. Henry Clay of Birmingham, England, patented a process for treating <b>laminated</b> <b>sheets</b> of paper with linseed oil to produce waterproof panels in 1772.

30|$|Three-year-old Cizhu bamboo (Neosinocalamus affinis) was {{obtained}} from Yibin, Sichuan Province, China. The bamboo culm (about 900  mm longitudinally and about 42  ×  4.2  mm in cross section) were selected {{from the middle of}} the trunk. The bamboo material had an initial moisture content (MC) of about 65  %. For material preparation, bamboo tubes were first split into four pieces of approximately the same size.

40|$|Abstract. Bending and {{subsequent}} stretching of sheet materials {{is typical of}} many sheet forming operations. Bending and bend-stretching characteristics and limit strain of monolithic AA 2024 and laminated tri-layer Alclad 2024 aluminum sheet materials are studied by modeling and experimentation. A computationally efficient analytical model based on advanced bending theory is developed for the <b>laminated</b> <b>sheet</b> materials and utilized to predict the bending characteristics of the above sheet materials. The effects of cladding thickness ratio on the bending characteristics of <b>laminated</b> <b>sheet</b> are compared with the monolithic constituent. Also, predictions from the above analytical bending model are compared with 2 D and 3 D FE-based bending models. In addition, bend-stretching experiments are conducted using a specialized test jig while continuously recording images using dual-camera set-up from tensile surface and edge of the specimen. A stochastic pattern {{is applied to the}} specimen prior to the test and the images are later processed to analyze the development and localization of strains based on digital image correlation (or DIC) method. Strain maps from DIC analysis are utilized to determine the limit strain {{in the vicinity of the}} bend line, as well as from FE modeling of bend-stretching tests, using maximum major strain acceleration criterion for localized necking proposed by one of the authors. The results from experimental and modeling work indicate higher limit strains in bend-stretching for Alclad 2024 compared to monolithic AA 2024 sheet...|$|E

Tensile failure of the adhesive occurred by a void-growth mechanism reminiscent of that by which ductile failure occurs in metals.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{experimental}} {{model of}} a new automated pre-preg lay-up process is developed {{to determine the effects}} of process parameters on the consolidation and quality of parts made of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) reinforced with carbon fibers (APC- 2). Temperature, tape velocity, and applied pressure affect the degree of consolidation of the laminates produced using this process. The consolidation’s dependence on applied pressure is clearly demonstrated. A threshold pressure of approximately 275 kPa (40 psi) exists for APC- 2, below which consolidation does not occur. This threshold is followed by a sharp increase in consolidation up to an applied pressure of 900 kPa (130 psi), and a much slower rate of increase in consolidation for pressures in excess of 900 kPa. The effect of velocity is qualitatively explored. The results of the experiment are discussed with reference to the development of robotic lay-up cells and continuous processes for the production of quasi-isotropic <b>laminated</b> <b>sheet.</b> KEY WORDS: automation, carbon fiber reinforced PEEK, processing...|$|E

The effects of temperature within the blank on formability and punch force are investigated. To study the <b>laminate</b> <b>sheet</b> behavior; three blank temperatures namely, 25 ̊ C, 100 ̊ C and 160 ̊ C are examined. In addition, the effect of grain size on punch force and material behavior for aluminum alloys 5052 and 1050 are studied. The aluminum sheets are annealed at 350 ̊ C 400 ̊ C and 450 ̊ C. The grain size effect, which strongly affects some properties such as formability parameters, stress, elongation and friction coefficient, is investigated. To measure the grain size the microstructure of Al 5052 and Al 1050 sheets is revealed by Polarized Light Microscope (PLM). In addition, to clarify the relative influences of grain size on the formability of Al 5052, some tensile tests on annealed specimen at 350 ̊ C, and 450 ̊ C are performed.
