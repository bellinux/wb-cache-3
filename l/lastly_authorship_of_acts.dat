5000|$|Henry VI, Part 1: {{possibly}} {{the work of}} a team of playwrights, whose identities are unknown. Some scholars argue that Shakespeare wrote less than 20% of the text. Gary Taylor argues that the first act was the work of Thomas Nashe. Paul J. Vincent concludes that, in light of recent research into the Elizabethan theatre, 1 Henry VI is Shakespeare's partial revision of a play by Nashe (Act 1) and an unknown playwright (Acts 2-5), the original of which was performed in early 1592. Shakespeare's work in the play, which was most likely composed in 1594, can be found in Act 2 (scene 4) and Act 4 (scenes 2-5 and the first 32 lines of scene 7). [...] Vincent's authorship findings, especially with regard to Nashe's <b>authorship</b> <b>of</b> <b>Act</b> 1, are supported overall by Brian Vickers, who agrees with the theory of co-authorship and differs only slightly over the extent of Shakespeare's contribution to the play, tentatively identifying Thomas Kyd as the author {{of the rest of the}} play.|$|R

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Michael Taylor {{believes}} that Shakespeare almost certainly wrote the entire play, as does J. J. M. Tobin, who, {{in his essay}} in Henry VI: Critical Essays (2001), argues the similarities to Nashe do not reveal the hand of Nashe {{at work in the}} composition of the play, but instead reveal Shakespeare imitating Nashe. More recently, in 2005, Paul J. Vincent has re-examined the question in light of recent research into the Elizabethan theatre, concluding that 1 Henry VI is Shakespeare's partial revision of a play by Nashe (Act 1) and an unknown playwright (Acts 2–5) and that it was the original, non-Shakespearean, play that was first performed on 3 March 1592. Shakespeare's work in the play, which was most likely composed in 1594, can be found in Act 2 (scene 4) and Act 4 (scenes 2–5 and the first 32 lines of scene 7). In 2007, Vincent's authorship findings, especially with regard to Nashe's <b>authorship</b> <b>of</b> <b>Act</b> 1, were supported overall by Brian Vickers, who agrees with the theory of co-authorship and differs only slightly over the extent of Shakespeare's contribution to the play.|$|R

5|$|From {{the moment}} of its {{founding}} the school was marred in controversy due to Senator Douglas's support of slavery and his <b>authorship</b> <b>of</b> the Kansas-Nebraska <b>Act.</b> Early fundraising efforts were further hampered as Douglas {{came under heavy fire}} during the run-up to the 1860 presidential election for his ownership of 123 slaves and a 3000-acre cotton plantation in Lawrence County, Mississippi. In response, trustees further encumbered the land to fund the university's operations while funneling cash donations to a separate account for what is today the University of Chicago Divinity School (which temporarily moved to a separate campus in Morgan Park before rejoining the larger university in its current location in Hyde Park location in 1891).|$|R
5000|$|Tradition calls Prochorus {{the nephew}} of Stephen and a {{companion}} of John the Evangelist, who consecrated him bishop of Nicomedia in Bithynia (modern-day Turkey). He was traditionally ascribed the <b>authorship</b> <b>of</b> the apocryphal <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> John, and {{was said to have}} ended his life as a martyr in Antioch in the 1st century. According to Caesar Baronius' Annales Ecclesiastici, now considered historically inaccurate, Nicanor was a Cypriot Jew who returned to his native island and died a martyr in 76. Other accounts say he was martyred in [...] "Berj," [...] an unidentified place possibly confused with Botrys. Timon was said to have been a Hellenized Jew who became a bishop in Greece or in Bosra, Syria; in the latter account, his preaching brought the ire of the local governor, who martyred him with fire. After preaching for years in Asia Minor, where Hippolytus of Rome claimed he was bishop of Soli (Pompeiopolis; though he may have been referring to Soli, Cyprus), Parmenas was said to have settled down in Macedonia, where he died at Philippi in 98 during Trajan's persecutions.|$|R

40|$|The book <b>of</b> <b>Acts</b> is {{an entity}} of its own. While it {{is a part}} of the {{canonical}} Bible as one of the sixty-six books, it is unique in that it presents the continuation of God’s plan from Jesus Christ to the growth of the early Christian church. More than that, in the book <b>of</b> <b>Acts</b> God further develops his plan of restoration to include not only the Jews but also the Gentiles. With Acts being a unique work of literature, each component of the work uniquely moves the story along. One component is that of the crowd, specifically the Greek word ochlos. This study will trace and examine the development of the ochlos from Luke’s <b>authorship</b> <b>of</b> his gospel through the book <b>of</b> <b>Acts...</b>|$|R

(The play's Prologue mentions Beaumont and Fletcher by name, while the Epilogue refers to a single author, probably meaning the reviser.)
