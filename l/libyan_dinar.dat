5000|$|The dinar (دينار dīnār) is the {{currency}} of Libya. Its ISO 4217 code is [...] "LYD". The dinar is subdivided into 1000 dirham (درهم). It was introduced in September 1971 and replaced the pound at par. It is issued by the Central Bank of Libya, which also supervises the banking system and regulates credit. In 1972, the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank was established to deal with overseas investment.Ali Mohammed Salem, deputy governor of Central Bank of Libya stated the exchange rate of <b>Libyan</b> <b>dinar</b> would be pegged to special drawing rights for one to three years, according to an interview to Reuters on 27 December 2011.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Libyan</b> <b>dinar</b> is {{commonly}} called jni, [...] (western Libyan Dialect) or jneh [...] (eastern Libyan dialect). The name dinar is rarely used outside official circles. The authorized fractional unit, the dirham, is never mentioned in everyday conversation. Garsh - {{a variant of}} the word qirsh - is employed instead, with 1 garsh = 10 dirhams. One thousand dinars is stylishly called a kilo [...] Similarly, five dinar notes and ten dinar notes are sometimes nicknamed, in the younger generation male slang, faifa [...] and tsena [...] respectively, which are playful feminizations of the English words five and ten, but may also be remnants of British slang words 'fiver' and 'tenner' for five and ten pound notes respectively. Libyan currency is nicknamed by Libyans ʿOmar El-Mokhtar after the Libyan freedom fighter who is featured on the obverse of the 10 dinar note.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on an {{economic}} analysis of Libya’s imports during the period 1970 - 2005, with special reference to the imports of capital goods and its impact on economic growth. In addition, the paper investigates the process of adjustment of imported intermediate inputs IMD, in the level of domestic economic growth GDPG, INF (Inflation) approximated by consumer prices, and RER the real exchange rate of <b>Libyan</b> <b>Dinar</b> against US$. The aim is to provide estimates of the aggregate demand of intermediate inputs imports in Libya, applying standard econometric techniques complemented by appropriate diagnostic tests based on recent and by now widely used dynamic modeling and cointegration techniques. As well as the paper tends to estimate the independent variables elasticity stated above for Libya’s imported intermediate inputs. Consequently, by using Augmented Dickey fuller tests (ADF) for stationarity and Johanson tests for cointegration, and granger causality test, results indicate that most variables are stationary in first difference, and in testing cointegration indicate long run relationship among all variables. The findings derived from the estimated econometric model are generally statistically meaningful. They show that the EU is the main supplier of intermediate goods to Libya. In addition, the results indicate that imports of capital goods and raw materials which consist more than 70 % of total imports have played a crucial impact in the diversification of the Libyan economy by increasing the contribution of the non oil sector...|$|E

50|$|In 1970, {{he began}} {{planning}} to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi {{one year after}} Gaddafi had seized power in a military coup. Along with his brother and other conspirators, he sought to replace the Gaddafi government and allegedly give {{people a chance to}} choose between a monarchy or a constitutional republic. He was arrested and sentenced to death; however, in 1988 his sentence was commuted to an additional 13 years incarceration, and his family was allowed to visit him. He stayed in solitary confinement for the first nine years of his sentence and was allegedly frequently tortured. He claims that the torture included frequent beatings with sticks, being strung up by his hands and legs, nearly drowned, and having his feet broken. After being let out of solitary confinement, he shared a cell with numerous other prisoners, including Omar El-Hariri. After being transferred to Abu Salim prison in 1984, he learned that his wife had died while he was in captivity. He received a pardon on the 32nd anniversary of Gaddafi taking power, and received US$ 107,300 (131,000 <b>Libyan</b> <b>dinars)</b> and a monthly pension of US$ 314.62 (400 <b>Libyan</b> <b>dinars).</b> He was held as a political prisoner for 31 years until his release in 2001, making him the longest incarcerated prisoner in modern Libyan history.|$|R

Its official task was to keep order in Tripoli. He allegedly misappropriated 900 million <b>Libyan</b> <b>Dinars</b> (US $720 million) {{to the benefit of}} the LROR, but this was not investigated as Abusahmain himself suppressed the inquiry. Soon after being formed, the LROR attempted an Islamist coup when the group kidnapped Prime Minister Ali Zeidan in October 2013.

2500|$|The EU {{maintains}} {{it did not}} pay {{compensation to}} either the infected children or their families: according to Sarkozy, Europe did not pay [...] "the slightest financial compensation" [...] for the medics' release. However, the European Commission committed $461 million to the Benghazi International Fund. Also, Bulgaria cancelled a probably noncollectible $57 million debt owed by Libya, and humanitarian funds were made available for both the infected's treatment and for a new children's hospital in Benghazi. Saif Gaddafi declared that the humanitarian aid to the Benghazi hospital amounted to [...] "not less than 300 million euros," [...] which was denied by the French, who declared that it was largely overestimated.

2500|$|A {{national}} vote on Gaddafi's {{plan was}} held in 2009, where Libya's people's congresses, collectively the country's highest authority, voted to delay implementation. The General People's Congress announced that, of 468 Basic People's Congresses, 64 chose immediate implementation while 251 endorsed implementation [...] "but asked for (it) to be delayed until appropriate measures were put in place". Some top government officials opposed the plan, saying that it would [...] "wreak havoc" [...] in the economy by [...] "fanning inflation and spurring capital flight". Gaddafi acknowledged that the scheme, which promised up to 30,000 <b>Libyan</b> <b>dinars</b> ($23,000) annually to about a million of Libya's poorest, may [...] "cause chaos before it brought about prosperity," [...] but said [...] "do not be afraid to experiment with {{a new form of}} government" [...] and that [...] "this plan is to offer a better future for Libya's children".|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} day, Abushagur held a {{press conference}} at the Rixos Conference Hotel where he accused the Zintani militia group as Barq Al-Nasr (Victory Lightening) as being behind his 9-hour kidnapping.

50|$|In 2001, the Libyan {{government}} proposed several state-company {{projects for}} which joint ventures would be considered. This included a $20 million modification of Lisco’s {{electric arc furnace}} as well as construction and installation of a $17 million ladle furnace. The Government also promoted development of numerous mineral deposits, including clay, gypsum, iron, lead, salt, sodium carbonate, and stone. Additionally, projects were initiated for quarrying limestone and dolomite and manufacturing lime and calcined dolomite for Lisco’s As Seddadah facility, 125 km southwest of Misrata. In 2004, Lisco signed a loan contract to develop LISCO I aimed at boosting capacity from 674 kn of liquid steel per year to 1.100 kn. This project is the first stage to raise capacity of LISCO I and II. In 2006, Lisco initiated an ambitious project aiming to double design capacity to 2.5 million tons by further developing facilities on the 4.5 sq mi plant near Misrata. Lisco signed a loan contract with one foreign partner, and the project {{was expected to be}} finalized in 2006. The Islamic Bank in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, partially financed the project's cost, with Lisco supplying the remaining amount. On 2 April 2007, Lisco signed financing agreements with five Libyan banking institutions (Sahara Bank, Aljamhoria, Attejari, Alomma and Alwahda) for 840 million <b>Libyan</b> <b>dinars</b> ($650 million) to execute another phase of their expansion plan. Lending his support, Libya's Secretary of Minerals and Industry, Ali Yusuf Zikri, said the loan should help create new employment opportunities and meet increasing local demand.|$|R
