40|$|Chiral oxazolopiperidone <b>lactams</b> {{are known}} to be {{valuable}} building blocks for the synthesis of enantiopure piperidines bearing virtually any type of substitution pattern,including diverse natural products and bioactive compounds. These <b>lactams</b> are synthesized by cyclocondensation of prochiral or racemic δ-oxo (di) esters with the chiral amino alcohol. Generally phenylglycinol is used as the amino alcohol and a final debenzylation is needed. In this review it is presented the use of (S) -tryptophanol as the chiral amino alcohol for the construction of complex piperidine-containing derivatives. The starting <b>lactams</b> are easily accessible, with very high stereoselectivities, by a cyclocondensation reaction of (S) -tryptophanol with an appropriate prochiral or racemic δ-oxo (di) esters. Finally, cyclization of the chiral oxazolopiperidone <b>lactams</b> provides a straightforward route to enantiopure indolo[2, 3 -a]quinolizidine skeleton and, by simply modulating the reactivity of the indole ring by tosylation, allows the synthesis of enantiopure spiro[indole- 3, 3 ’-indolizidine] skeleton...|$|R

25|$|The {{eastern part}} of the {{molecule}} BC (cyanobromide 37) and the western part AD (thiodextrolin 55, with the propionic acid ester group racemized) were then joined using potassium t-butoxide to thioether 56 (through a sulfide ion intermediate). A second sulfur contraction (cyanoethyl phosphine/ trifluoroacetic acid/sulfolane) yielded cyanocorrigenolide 57 with the propionic acid ester group of ring C also racemised. Due to the steric bulk of both reactants this contraction was the only successful method. The oxygen atoms in the <b>lactam</b> and the lactone group were replaced by sulfur (phosphorus pentasulfide/4-methylpyridine) in dithiocyanocorrigenolide 58 and the S-methyl derivate 59 was formed by reaction with trimethyloxonium fluoroborate. Dimethylamine addition opened the thiolactone ring with an exocyclic alkene group in 60 by elimination of the sulfide anion from the methyl group. In an early example of template-directed synthesis this compound was isolated as the cobalt adduct.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe ion—molecule {{reactions}} of dimethyl ether ions CH 3 OCH+ 2 and (CH 3 OCH 3) H+, and four- to seven-membered ring <b>lactams</b> with methyl substituents in various positions {{were characterized by}} using a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer and a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. In both instruments, the <b>lactams</b> were protonated by dimethyl ether ions and formed various combinations of [M + 13]+, [M + 15]+, and [M + 45]+ adduct ions, as well as unusual [M + 3]+ and [M + 16]+ adduct ions. An additional [M + 47]+ adduct ion was formed in the conventional chemical ionization source of the triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. The product ions were isolated and collisionally activated in the quadrupole ion trap to understand formation pathways, structures, and characteristic dissociation pathways. Sequential activation experiments were performed to elucidate fragment ion structures and stepwise dissociation sequences. Protonated <b>lactams</b> dissociate by loss of water, ammonia, or methylamine; ammonia and carbon monoxide; and water and ammonia or methylamine. The [M + 16]+ products, which are identified as protonated lactone structures, are only formed by those <b>lactams</b> {{that do not have}} an N-methyl substituent.
