25|$|Lymphedema, {{also known}} as <b>lymphoedema</b> and lymphatic edema, is a {{condition}} of localized fluid retention and tissue swelling caused by a compromised lymphatic system, which normally returns interstitial fluid to the thoracic duct, then the bloodstream. The condition can be inherited or {{can be caused by}} a birth defect, though it is frequently caused by cancer treatments and by parasitic infections. Though incurable and progressive, a number of treatments can ameliorate symptoms. Tissues with lymphedema are at high risk of infection.|$|E

40|$|Aim: This study {{explored}} {{the nature of}} supported self-care for women who had <b>lymphoedema</b> associated with breast cancer treatment, {{and the work of}} <b>lymphoedema</b> practitioners. Background: Health policy indicated a need to examine the potentially evolving roles of individuals with long term conditions who undertake self-care, and health professionals who provide support. <b>Lymphoedema</b> affects around one in five women who undergo treatment for breast cancer. A woman with <b>lymphoedema</b> can experience long term swelling, most commonly of her arm, affecting her life in various ways. Methods: Three small group discussions were undertaken with women who had lived with <b>lymphoedema</b> {{for more than two years}} (n= 7). Field observation (n= 16) of clinic appointments with women who had <b>lymphoedema,</b> were undertaken alongside interviews (n= 15) with eight <b>lymphoedema</b> practitioners. Women who had newly developed <b>lymphoedema</b> (n= 10) were interviewed three times over a period of six months. The study was underpinned by social constructionist perspectives, and informed by feminism and relational autonomy theory. Findings: Various structures of power influenced the capacity for supported self-care in women and practitioners. <b>Lymphoedema</b> influenced women's self-identity, and women experienced substantial distress and frustration relating to the initial development of <b>lymphoedema,</b> the chronic nature of the condition, and in adapting to self-care. <b>Lymphoedema</b> practitioners provided support for women from within a mainly bio-medical framework of care, often based within acute clinical settings. Accessing local, trusted information and advice relating to <b>lymphoedema</b> self-care was challenging for some women. Conclusion: An anticipatory approach to supported self-care was identified. The development of reflexivity and self-discovery was considered equally relevant to women with <b>lymphoedema</b> and <b>lymphoedema</b> practitioners. Professional approaches to support should recognise this anticipatory perspective and enable timely access for women to individualised and appropriate support at key points in their <b>lymphoedema</b> trajectory.

40|$|Research {{investigating}} {{the role of}} exercise in the prevention and/or management of <b>lymphoedema</b> is lacking. For fear of initiating or exacerbating <b>lymphoedema,</b> and its associated symptoms, those with <b>lymphoedema</b> have traditionally been cautioned against engaging in physical activity rather than encouraged to be regularly active. However, recent preliminary findings suggest that being inactive may increase risk of developing lymphedema, and that for those with <b>lymphoedema,</b> participation in an exercise program does not exacerbate the condition. This presentation will address why engaging in regular physical activity is important, {{what we know about}} the role of exercise with respect to <b>lymphoedema</b> prevention and management, and will provide some practical recommendations about becoming and staying regularly active for those with <b>lymphoedema.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Lymphoedema</b> is {{a chronic}} {{condition}} {{which has a}} significant impact on the lives of sufferers. Services for <b>lymphoedema</b> management are not standard throughout the UK. Recently a request for funding of <b>lymphoedema</b> services in Fife required the creation of a needs assessment. Aims: the study aim was to establish whether or not <b>lymphoedema</b> presents a health-related need, addressing two main questions: do people with <b>lymphoedema</b> have a legitimate physical and'or psychological need for health care and do they beenfit from the health care thay are given? Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted to explore the views of five <b>lymphoedema</b> service providers and five service users. Thematic analysis was undertaken. Results: Interview analysis indicated that the physical and psychological impact of <b>lymphoedema</b> has detrimental effects on daily function and paricipation in various aspects of life. Participants benefited from management, both physically and psychologically. Those with realistic expectations of management and who wished to take control of their symptoms expressed greater satisfaction with <b>lymphoedema</b> services. Conclusions: <b>Lymphoedema</b> leads to physical, psychological and social problems that can be alleviated through specialist management, thereby representing a health-related need.

40|$|Question: What is the {{relationship}} between the severity of <b>lymphoedema</b> with the number of medical conditions present and the frequency of cellulitis in patients with cancer and non-cancer related <b>lymphoedema?</b> Design: This research was undertaken as a service evaluation for the Lothian <b>lymphoedema</b> service. Participants: 258 patients with a recorded level of severity were included from the Lothian <b>lymphoedema</b> service. 26 patients without a recorded frequency of cellulitis were then excluded from the severity of <b>lymphoedema</b> and frequency of cellulitis analysis only. Patients with a recorded active cancer or history of cancer were included in the cancer group while those without were grouped into the non-cancer group. Results: A weak link between an increased severity of <b>lymphoedema</b> with an increased number of medical conditions was observed in both the cancer (p= 0. 003; τ= 0. 330) and non-cancer (p= 0. 03; τ= 0. 129) groups. No relationship between the severity of <b>lymphoedema</b> and frequency of cellulitis was found in the cancer (p= 0. 202; τ = 0. 221) and non-cancer (p= 0. 108; τ= 0. 064) groups. A number of factors influenced the validity of these results. Conclusion: Patients with a higher number of co-existing medical conditions are at a higher risk of developing a more severe <b>lymphoedema</b> in both patient with cancer and non-cancer related <b>lymphoedema.</b> The severity of <b>lymphoedema</b> has not been shown to influence the frequency of cellulitis therefore all patient with <b>lymphoedema</b> should be adequately educated about cellulitis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lymphoedema</b> {{refers to}} {{swelling}} or oedema which {{is comprised of}} lymph fluid. It is caused by damage to or malformation of the lymphatic system. It frequently develops after treatment for cancer, most often breast cancer but also cervical, prostate, bladder and bowel cancer. Furthermore it can occur as a complication of non-cancer related conditions or can develop independently. The swelling usually occurs in the limbs. However, it can also occur {{in other parts of}} the body such as the head, neck, breast and genitalia, depending on the location of the lymphatic impairment (Moffatt et al., 2006). It is a chronic, incurable condition believed to affect at least 1. 33 per 1, 000 of the population (Moffatt et al., 2003). <b>Lymphoedema</b> can lead to pain, discomfort, and increased susceptibility to skin infections such as cellulitis, which may require hospitalisation (Morgan, Franks & Moffatt, 2005). <b>Lymphoedema</b> can also have significant psychological and social consequences (Morgan, Franks et al., 2005; McWayne & Heiney, 2005; Tobin et al., 1993; Williams et al., 2004). Given the chronic nature of <b>lymphoedema,</b> its impact on physical and psychological health and the potential increase in prevalence rates, it is imperative that <b>lymphoedema</b> patients have access to patient-centred, evenly distributed services. Previous studies of <b>lymphoedema</b> service provision in Australia and the UK have found arbitrarily located, disjointed and under-resourced services (Australasian Lymphology Association, 2003; BreastCare Victoria, 2005; DHSSPS, 2004; Morgan, 2006; Todd, 2006). While anecdotal evidence suggests that similar difficulties in <b>lymphoedema</b> service provision are present in Ireland, to date, there has been no research conducted on <b>lymphoedema</b> service provision or on patients’ experiences of living with <b>lymphoedema</b> in the Republic of Ireland. Without a clear picture from both practitioners’ and patients’ perspectives coordination between services, planning on how to develop and expand services and formulation on how to address gaps and inequalities cannot take place. The overall aims of the present study were to investigate current <b>lymphoedema</b> service provision from both service providers’ and patients’ perspectives, in addition to exploring patients’ experiences of living with <b>lymphoedema</b> in Ireland, for the first time. These aims were achieved through a three-stage project. The first phase of the study involved a postal survey of <b>lymphoedema</b> practitioners to explore their perspective on current <b>lymphoedema</b> service provision in Ireland, thereby setting the scene and informing subsequent phases of the research. The second phase of the study employed focus group methodology to explore patients’ experiences of accessing treatment and living with <b>lymphoedema.</b> Finally the third phase of the study involved a postal survey of <b>lymphoedema</b> patients to investigate the experiences of a wider group of <b>lymphoedema</b> patients. The findings from all three phases were integrated in order to provide a more complete depiction of <b>lymphoedema</b> service provision and patients’ experiences of living with <b>lymphoedema,</b> and to inform recommendations...|$|E

30|$|Our {{findings}} have {{led us to}} conclude that clinician-judgement should be combined with objective measurement of ELV to avoid underestimation of BCRL, and to detect mild arm <b>lymphoedema</b> and also <b>lymphoedema</b> limited to the hand; in addition, patient self-report {{should be taken into}} consideration. Further research should be conducted to determine the protective and treatment benefits of providing group education from a <b>lymphoedema</b> expert and of teaching specific exercise; this is in addition to providing written information regarding <b>lymphoedema</b> care and general exercise.|$|E
