40|$|It {{was shown}} that the {{immunity}} induced by a primary and secondary dose of antigen varying from 25 to 135 Lf APT, protected sheep for only about nine weeks. Any booster dose given before {{a year after the}} primary injection resulted in protective titres lasting for periods up to about 20 weeks. When a sound basic immunity is established, e. g. with two <b>doses</b> of 135 <b>Lf,</b> sheep are protected to the same extent by a large (135 Lf) or small (25 <b>Lf)</b> booster <b>dose</b> given one year after the primary injection. The protection thus effected lasts for at least one year. When sheep with a sound basic immunity receive a booster of 135 Lf after one year and a second booster of 135 Lf after a further year, they are protected against pulpy kidney disease {{for at least three years}} following the last injection. A single injection of epsilon toxoid in Freund's complete or incomplete adjuvant protects sheep for at least two years. The journals have been scanned in colour with a HP 5590 scanner; 600 dpi.

40|$|Background In Africa, {{albendazole}} and ivermectin {{are currently}} used in combination for annual mass drug administration (MDA) for lymphatic filariasis (LF) elimination. Rapid and sustained clearance is desirable {{for public health}} impact and elimination of <b>LF.</b> Increasing the <b>dose</b> and/or frequency of albendazole and ivermectin treatment {{may be more effective}} in clearing microfilariae than standard MDA. Methods We conducted a randomised controlled open label trial in northern Malawi comparing three modified treatment groups to standard dosage of ivermectin and albendazole in adults with confirmed circulating LF antigen and microfilaria. Participants were followed-up every 6 months for 2 years for repeat microfilarial counts and safety assessments. Results A total of 1851 adults were screened and 70 with microfilarial counts > 80 microfilariae/ml were randomised. All treatment groups achieved a significant reduction of microfilariae levels by 12 - and 24 -months of follow-up. Doubling the standard dose and administering it twice yearly showed a non-significant tendency towards faster and more complete clearance. There were no serious adverse reactions. Conclusions In this small study, all regimens effectively cleared microfilaria. Standard treatment may be adequate in settings like Malawi but not in all endemic settings and larger studies are required to demonstrate benefit of higher dosages.

40|$|Progression of {{rheumatoid}} arthritis (RA) {{leads to the}} generalization of a pathological process, by involving new joints and extra-articular structures, the formation of irreversible changes, and resistance to performed therapy. The most favorable conditions for its treatment {{are available at the}} onset of the disease in the patients who have not received basic anti-inflammatory therapy. Therefore the solution of practical issues of medical care to patients with early-stage RA is quite urgent. It is necessary to decide as soon as possible whether basic anti-inflammatory drugs (BAIDs) should be used in patients with verified RA or at real risk for its development. Preference is usually given to conventional BAIDs at the first stage of therapy. Till recently methotrexate (MT) has been the gold standard treatment of such patients. However, the latest guidelines of the American College of Rheumatology for the use of biological and non-biological BAIDs recommend that MT of leflunomide (LF) should be given at a physician's discretion. The standard scheme for using <b>LF</b> in graded <b>doses</b> makes it possible to provide the therapeutic blood concentration of the drug just within the first week of therapy and a noticeable clinical improvement within the first month. So LF acts much more rapidly than other conventional BAIDs and may be of particular interest in treating RA...|$|R
40|$|OBJECT: Identification of new {{therapeutic}} agents {{aimed at}} attenuating posttraumatic brain edema formation remains an unresolved challenge. Among others, activation of bradykinin B 2 receptors {{is known to}} mediate the formation of brain edema. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the protective effect of the novel nonpeptide B 2 receptor antagonist, LF 16 - 0687 Ms, in brain-injured rats. METHODS: Focal contusion was produced by controlled cortical impact injury. Five minutes after trauma, the rats received a single dose of no, low- (3 mg/kg body weight), or high- (30 mg/kg) <b>dose</b> <b>LF</b> 16 - 0687 Ms. After 24 hours, the amount of brain swelling and hemispheric water content were determined. Low and high <b>doses</b> of <b>LF</b> 16 - 0687 Ms significantly reduced brain swelling by 25 % and 27 %, respectively (p < 0. 03). Hemispheric water content tended to be increased in the nontraumatized hemisphere. In a subsequent series of 10 rats, cisternal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected to determine whether changes in substances associated with edema formation could clarify why LF 16 - 0687 Ms increases water content. For this, the volume regulator amino acid taurine, the excitatory transmitter glutamate, and the adenosine triphosphate degradation products hypoxanthine and xanthine were measured. In CSF, the levels of taurine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine were significantly decreased following a single administration of LF 16 - 0687 Ms (p < 0. 005); the level of glutamate, however, was double that found in control animals (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Using the present study design, a single administration of LF 16 - 0687 Ms successfully reduced posttraumatic brain swelling. The decreased levels of taurine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine may reflect reduced posttraumatic brain edema, whereas the increased level of glutamate could account for the elevated water content observed in the nontraumatized hemisphere...|$|R
40|$|Hexavalent {{chromium}} (CrVI) is a {{heavy metal}} widely used in more than 50 industries. Nephrotoxicity is a major adverse effect of chromium poisoning. The present study investigated the potential renoprotective effect of lactoferrin (Lf) against potassium dichromate (PDC) -induced acute kidney injury (AKI) in rats. Beside, because previous studies suggest that interlukin- 18 (IL- 18) and insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) play important roles in promoting kidney damage, the present work aimed to evaluate the involvement of these two cytokines in PDC model of AKI and in the potential renoprotective effect of lactoferrin. Adult male albino Wistar rats were pretreated with Lf (200 mg/kg/day, p. o.) or (300 mg/kg/day, p. o.); the doses that are usually used in the experiment studies, for 14 days followed by a single dose of PDC (15 mg/kg, s. c.). PDC caused significant increase in serum urea, creatinine, and total protein levels. This was accompanied with decreased renal glutathione content, and increased renal malondialdehyde, IL- 18, IL- 4, nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), IGF- 1, and the phosphorylated form of forkhead box protein O 1 (FoxO 1) levels. Moreover, normal expression IFN-γ mRNA and enhanced expression of TNF-α mRNA was demonstrated in renal tissues. Histopathological investigations provoked deleterious changes in the renal tissues. Tubular epithelial hyperplasia and apoptosis were demonstrated immunohistochemically by positive proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Bax, and Caspase- 3 expression, respectively. Pretreatment of rats with <b>Lf</b> in both <b>doses</b> significantly corrected all previously mentioned PDC-induced changes with {{no significant difference between}} both doses. In conclusion, the findings of the present study demonstrated the involvement of oxidative stress, inflammatory reactions, tubular hyperplasia and apoptosis in PDC-induced AKI. It suggested a role of IL- 18 through stimulation of IL- 4 -induced inflammatory pathway, and IGF- 1 through triggering FoxO 1 -induced cell proliferation. Moreover, the study revealed that Lf protected the kidney against Cr-induced AKI in rats and significantly showed antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-proliferative properties with down-regulation of IL- 18 and IGF- 1...|$|R
