5000|$|The {{inscription}} {{has received}} significant attention from historians and archaeologists of early Latium {{not only for}} its obvious antiquity and <b>linguistic</b> <b>value</b> but also because of the name preserved on the inscription. The archaic name of Poplios Valesios is rendered in Classical Latin as [...] "Publius Valerius". That has inevitably led to speculation that the inscription refers to none other than the famous Publius Valerius Publicola, the patrician ally of Lucius Junius Brutus who dominates the list of early consuls recorded by the Fasti Capitolini and is credited, in traditional accounts, as one of the primary founders of the Roman Republic. Positive identification is at least somewhat problematic because the town of Satricum was not part of Roman territory when Publius Valerius was consul. However, the [...] "lapis" [...] itself may not have been dedicated in Satricum in the first place since it was found as part of a collection of recycled material used in the construction of a temple in the town, and it could well have been imported from elsewhere.|$|E

It is a curious picture of criminal life, the best, and seemingly the most faithful, of its kind, and possesses also some <b>linguistic</b> <b>value,</b> as being mainly written in the Scottish thieves' cant, which contains a good many genuine Romany words. Lord Cockburn, writing from recollection in 1848, declares the whole book to be [...] "a tissue of absolute lies, not of mistakes, or of exaggerations, or of fancies, but of sheer and intended lies. And they all had one object, to make him appear a greater villain than he really was". On the other hand, the contemporaneous account of the trial, {{so far as it}} goes, bears out Haggart's narrative Cockburn is certainly wrong in describing Haggart as [...] "about twenty-five", and in stating that the portrait prefixed professed to be [...] "by his own hand". This autobiography later served as the inspiration for the 1969 movie Sinful Davey. It is available in several reprint formats, but no new edition has ever been issued.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} proposes a {{methodology}} based on fuzzy association rules and spatial analysis for knowledge discovery, expressed through linguistic rules, {{of the information}} pertaining to ichthyofauna and limnology themes of the PIATAM Project. An algorithm {{with the ability to}} deal with numerical and categorical data and to associate objects with geographical properties through spatial analysis was developed. The methodology included pre-processing (data selection, cleaning, summarizing and transformation), data mining, visualization and evaluation. In the pre-processing step, the themes were spatially associated according to the criteria of proximity. Analyses of distance of the community centers were also incorporated. In the transformation stage, the variables were partitioned in <b>linguistic</b> <b>values.</b> The data mining algorithm uses onedimensional candidates (<b>linguistic</b> <b>values)</b> to produce others of higher dimensions. The last step consisted of the construction of association rules through the application of Boolean operators. The strong rules were then geocoded through the fuzzy membership of the <b>linguistic</b> <b>values.</b> The performance of this mining study was considered reasonable, based in specific rules. The spatial visualization of the strong rules through the geocoded fuzzy membership of the <b>linguistic</b> <b>values</b> showed to be useful, inasmuch as it allowed a better inspection of the strength of the rule in the different communities.

5000|$|At the First International Congress of the Spanish Language, held in 1997 in Zacatecas, Mexico, {{controversy}} emerged {{around the}} concept of Standard Spanish. Some authors, such as the Spanish writer José Antonio Millán, advocated defining a [...] "common Spanish", composed of {{the lowest common denominator}} of most dialects. Others, such as the journalist Fermín Bocos (director of Radio Exterior de España), denied the existence of a problem and espoused the colonialist idea of the supposed superiority of educated Castilian Spanish over dialects with more influence from other languages. Finally, experts from the Americas such as Lila Petrella stated that a neutral Spanish language could possibly be developed for use in purely descriptive texts, but that the major variations among dialects with regard to semantics and pragmatics would imply {{that it is impossible to}} define a single standard variety that would have the same <b>linguistic</b> <b>value</b> for all Spanish-speakers. Above all, certain grammatical structures are impossible to form in a neutral way, due to differences in the verb conjugations used (e.g. the use of the second-person familiar pronoun vos in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Central American countries, while most other countries prefer tú, and most Colombians tend to use usted in the informal context—and all three pronouns require different verb conjugations). At least one of the three versions will always sound odd in any given Spanish-speaking country.|$|E
