In 1917 he was appointed to the junior ministerial post of Financial Secretary to the Treasury, where he sought to encourage voluntary donations by the rich to repay the United Kingdom's war debt, writing letters to The Times under the pseudonym 'FST', many of which were published.

2500|$|Grammar {{and style}} guides often differ {{as to how}} {{percentages}} are to be written. For instance, it is commonly suggested that the word percent (or per cent) be spelled out in all texts, as in [...] "1percent" [...] and not [...] "1%". Other guides prefer the word to be written out in humanistic texts, but the symbol {{to be used in}} scientific texts. Most guides agree that they always be written with a numeral, as in [...] "5percent" [...] and not [...] "five percent", the only exception being {{at the beginning of a}} sentence: [...] "Ten percent of all writers love style guides." [...] Decimals are also to be used instead of fractions, as in [...] "3.5percent of the gain" [...] and not [...] " [...] percent of the gain". However the titles of bonds issued by governments and other issuers use the fractional form, e.g. [...] "% Unsecured <b>Loan</b> <b>Stock</b> 2032 Series 2". (When interest rates are very low, the number 0 is included if the interest rate is less than 1%, e.g. [...] "0 3/4% Treasury Stock", not [...] "3/4% Treasury Stock".) It is also widely accepted to use the percent symbol (%) in tabular and graphic material.|$|E
40|$|<b>Stock</b> <b>loans</b> {{have been}} {{recognized}} as a popular financial contract and considered as an alternative for investors to increase liquidity. Consequently, an accurate and efficient valuation of <b>stock</b> <b>loans</b> is necessary. Although there are some existing literatures on the valuation of <b>stock</b> <b>loans,</b> {{to the best of}} our knowledge, most are for perpetual <b>loans.</b> In reality, <b>stock</b> <b>loan</b> contracts mostly last for less than 10 years. It is, therefore, important to develop accurate and efficient evaluation methods for <b>stock</b> <b>loans</b> of finite maturity. This thesis explores a semi-analytic method for evaluating American puts in Zhu [2006] and proposes a modified semi-analytic method to evaluate <b>stock</b> <b>loans</b> in finite maturity. Three types of <b>stock</b> <b>loans</b> are formulated and solved as the corresponding American option problems under the Black-Scholes framework. First, finite non-recourse <b>stock</b> <b>loans</b> with three different dividend distributions are formulated as American calls, and solved using Zhu’s semi-analytic method. Our results are compared with those in Dai and Xu [2011]. Then margin call <b>stock</b> <b>loans</b> are formulated as American Down-and-Out call options with rebate, and solved using the semi-analytic method. The dependency of the optimal exit price and the <b>stock</b> <b>loan</b> value on payback amount, and other parameters such as effective interest rate and volatility, are analyzed as well. Finally, <b>Stock</b> <b>loans</b> under a two-state regime switching economy are formulated as the corresponding Regime switching American Call options. A modified semi-analytic method is proposed to find the solutions of the optimal exit prices and <b>stock</b> <b>loan</b> values. Furthermore, fair service fee are calculated as well for different scenarios. The results of thesis could be used for borrowers and lenders to consider their exit policy and decide the service fee fairly...|$|R

40|$|A <b>stock</b> <b>loan</b> is {{a special}} <b>loan</b> with <b>stocks</b> as collateral, which offers the borrowers the right to redeem the stocks on or before the {{maturity}} (Xia and Zhou, 2007; Dai and Xu, 2011).

In the infinite-maturity case, we derive closed-form formulas for <b>stock</b> <b>loan</b> prices and deltas by solving the related optimal stopping problem explicitly. Moreover, we obtain a sufficient and necessary condition under which the optimal stopping time is finite with probability one. In the finite-maturity case, we provide analytical approximations to both <b>stock</b> <b>loan</b> prices and deltas by solving an ordinary integro-differential equation {{as well as a}} complicated non-linear system. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the approximation methods for both prices and deltas are accurate, fast, and easy to implement. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Mathematically, <b>stock</b> <b>loans</b> {{can be regarded}} as American call options with a time-dependent strike price once established. This study focuses on <b>stock</b> <b>loans</b> under a stochastic interest rate framework. The partial diferential equation (PDE) governing the value of the <b>stock</b> <b>loan</b> is derived by portfolio analysis. Boundary conditions are then prescribed to close the PDE system. In particular, boundary conditions along the interest rate direction are the focus of our derivation. After simplifying the pricing system by a series of transformations, the predictor-corrector method is adopted to solve the transformed PDE system numerically. Moreover, we introduce the alternating direction implicit (ADI) method in the two-factor model to improve the computational effciency. To ensure the stability of the predictor-corrector method, a hybrid finite difference scheme is adopted. Numerical results suggest that the current method is reliable and the stochastic interest rate leads to a higher optimal exercise price of the <b>stock</b> <b>loan</b> in comparison with that calculated from the Black-Scholes model...|$|R
