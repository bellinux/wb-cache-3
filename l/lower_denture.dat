25|$|Generally {{speaking}} partial dentures {{tend to be}} held {{in place}} by the presence of the remaining natural teeth and complete dentures tend to rely on muscular co-ordination and suction to stay in place. The maxilla very commonly has more favorable denture bearing anatomy as the ridge tends to be well formed and there is a larger area on the palate for suction to retain the denture. Conversely, the mandible tends to make lower dentures less retentive due to the displacing presence of the tongue and the higher rate of resorption, frequently leading to significantly resorbed lower ridges. Disto-lingual regions tend to offer retention even in highly resorbed mandibles, and extension of the flange into these regions tends to produce a more retentive <b>lower</b> <b>denture.</b> An implant supported <b>lower</b> <b>denture</b> is another option.|$|E
25|$|In {{cases where}} a patient needs a {{complete}} {{upper and lower}} set of dentures, costs can be reduced by having a conventional non-implanted upper denture, since retention of upper dentures {{is much easier to}} achieve, and an implanted <b>lower</b> <b>denture,</b> since lower dentures tend not to fit as well otherwise.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{efficacy}} of three denture brushes (Bitufo-B; Medic Denture-MD; Colgate-C) on biofilm removal from upper and <b>lower</b> <b>dentures</b> using a specific dentifrice (Corega Brite). The correlation between biofilm levels on the internal and external surfaces of the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>dentures</b> was also evaluated. A microbiological assay was performed to assess the growth of colony-formed units (cfu) of Candida yeasts on denture surface. Thirty-three patients were enrolled in a 10 -week trial divided in two stages: 1 (control) - three daily water rinses within 1 week; 2 - three daily brushings within 3 weeks per tested brush. Internal (tissue) and external (right buccal flange) surfaces of the complete dentures were disclosed (neutral red 1 %) and photographed. Total denture areas and disclosed biofilm areas were measured using Image Tool 3. 00 software for biofilm quantification. Dentures were boxed with # 7 wax and culture medium (CHROMagarTM Candida) was poured to reproduce the internal surface. Statistical analysis by Friedman's test showed significant difference (p 0. 01). Analysis by the Correlation test showed higher r values (B= 0. 78; MD= 0. 8341, C= 0. 7362) for the <b>lower</b> <b>dentures</b> comparing the surfaces (internal and external) and higher r values (B= 0. 7861, MD= 0. 7955, C= 0. 8298) for the external surface comparing the <b>dentures</b> (upper and <b>lower).</b> The results of the microbiological showed no significant difference (p> 0. 01) between the brushes with respect to the frequency of the species of yeasts (chi-square test). In conclusion, all denture brushes evaluated in this study were effective in the removal of biofilm. There was better correlation of biofilm levels between the surfaces for the <b>lower</b> <b>dentures,</b> and between the dentures for the external surface.

40|$|AIM: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate patient satisfaction with removable prostheses and its relationship with denture quality. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-seven patients who received 119 new removable prostheses over a period of one year at the College of Dentistry, King Saud University, were recalled for an interview with regard to their satisfaction with their dentures and a clinical examination. Prosthetic quality was determined using the California Dental Association criteria. RESULTS: Results showed 75 % and 66 % of upper and <b>lower</b> <b>dentures,</b> respectively, were reported by patients as satisfactory. Of all the upper prostheses rated as being of acceptable quality, 94 % were also reported by patients as satisfactory, but of those of unacceptable quality, only 52 % were reported by patients as unsatisfactory. The corresponding figures for <b>lower</b> <b>dentures</b> were 91 % and 71 %, respectively. No significant associations were found between patient satisfaction and age, or denture experience. CONCLUSION: Although acceptable quality of removable prostheses usually resulted in patient satisfaction, the finding that some patients were satisfied with their prostheses despite unacceptable quality suggests other factors besides quality affect outcomes. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Patient satisfaction with removable dentures cannot be fully predicted from only the quality standards of those dentures. King Saud Universit...|$|R

MethodsA randomized clinical trial was conducted on two groups; group 1 (30 patients) received complete upper and <b>lower</b> <b>dentures</b> with teeth made of heat-cured acrylic resin, and group 2 (29 patients) received complete upper and <b>lower</b> <b>dentures</b> with teeth fabricated of porcelain. The occurrence and clinical examination of temporomandibular disorders were evaluated using Helkimo anamnestic dysfunction index (Ai) and Helkimo clinical dysfunction index (Di), respectively. Clinical wear of denture teeth was estimated by the assessment of wear depth using the mean differences between tracing images of lingual cusps at each follow-up. The patients were followed up at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months for assessment of clinical wear and incidence of temporomandibular disorders. ResultsThe acrylic resin group was subjected to significantly higher wear than the porcelain group at 12, 18 and 24 months of follow-up. The incidence of temporomandibular disorders was also significantly higher in the acrylic resin group than in the porcelain group at 18 and 24 months of follow-up.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} study was to assess treatment outcome and impact on {{quality of life of}} prosthodontic rehabilitation with implant-retained prostheses in head-neck cancer patients. Fifty patients were evaluated by standardized questionnaires and clinical assessment. All received the implants during ablative tumour surgery in native bone in the interforaminal area. About two-thirds of the patients (n = 31) needed radiotherapy post-surgery. Both in irradiated and non-irradiated bone two implants were lost 18 - 24 months after installation. Peri-implant tissues had a healthy appearance. No cases of osteoradionecrosis occurred. In 15 patients no functional implant-retained <b>lower</b> <b>dentures</b> could be made for various reasons. The other 35 patients all functioned well, with an improvement in quality of life. Major improvement was observed in the non-irradiated patients. In the irradiated patients, less improvement in many functional items was observed, while items related to the oral sequelae of radiotherapy did not improve. Similar to the quality-of-life assessments, denture satisfaction was improved and tended to be higher in non-irradiated than irradiated patients.

40|$|Objectives. The study {{investigates the}} effects on Hb 1 Ac levels in type 2 diabetics after {{placement}} of maxillary (upper) and/or mandibular (<b>lower)</b> full removable <b>dentures.</b> Background. Health department adult dental patients normally have many periodontal and dental problems. Patients with severe disease opt for removal of teeth in the upper and/or lower arch and then placement of full removable dentures to restore function. Periodontal disease, an infection of the soft and hard tissues supporting teeth, causes an inflammatory and immunologic response that destroys tissue and erodes bone. Dental infections primarily originate from tooth decay. Both can cause a systemic response; but the best evidence centers on periodontal disease and effects on diabetes. Design. This is a case-series (descriptive) study design using a routine database analysis. Methods. Subjects had type 2 diabetes, and placement of full dentures during 01 / 03 / 2006 to 03 / 19 / 2007. They had HbA 1 c tests 6 mouths prior and after insertion of dentures. Twenty–two patients met the selection criteria. They were from 35 to 75 years old {{with a mean age}} of 60. Result. Results show a positive effect on Hb 1 Ac values pre- and post insertion of dentures: pre-test x̄ of 8. 73 and a post-test x̄ of 7. 12, a 1. 6 unit difference. Differences were significant for all 3 patient groups; all cases (p-value= 0. 01 3 ̆c 0. 05); those with upper and <b>lower</b> <b>dentures</b> (pvalue= 0. 013 3 ̆c 0. 05), and those with either upper or <b>lower</b> <b>dentures</b> (p-value= 0. 0189 3 ̆c 0. 05).

The treatment outcome was assessed in a group of 26 head neck cancer patients who were subjected to radiotherapy after tumour surgery. Standardized questionnaires were completed and clinical and radiographic assessments were performed. After randomization, endosseous Branemark implants were placed in the anterior part of the mandible either under antibiotic prophylaxis (13 patients) or under antibiotic prophylaxis combined with pre and postsurgery hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment (13 patients). In the HBO and non-HBO group eight implants (implant survival 85. 2 %) and three implants (implant survival 93. 9 %) were lost, respectively. Peri-imptant tissues had a healthy appearance in both groups. Osteoradionecrosis developed in one patient in the HBO group. All patients functioned welt with their implant-retained tower denture. The quality of life related to oral functioning and denture satisfaction were improved to a comparable extent in the HBO and non-HBO group.

40|$|Magister Scientiae Dentium - MSc(Dent) Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the accuracy, intra- and inter-observer reliability of identifying occlusal markings made by articulating paper on complete dentures intra-orally. Methods: A series of photographs of 14 tissue borne complete dentures with occlusal markings was obtained. Articulating paper was used intra-orally at the delivery visit to make the occlusal markings. The denture sets were divided into two groups. Group 1 comprised pictures of the 14 complete <b>lower</b> <b>dentures</b> on their own, and group 2 comprised pictures of the same 14 <b>lower</b> <b>dentures</b> together with their opposing upper denture. The two groups of images were loaded into a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation as well as Keynote. Two experienced observers analysed the complete dentures independently and noted the number and distribution of the markings that they felt required adjustment. They differed, but discussed these and reached consensus. These data served as the control. Three groups of observers (10 per group) were then asked to analyse the occlusal markings of the 2 groups of denture images twice, with a two-week interval between each assessment. Before each subsequent assessment, the images were randomised by means of computer-generated random number sequence. The mean number of markings was established for each group and compared with the control mean. Intra-rater reliability was established by comparing the difference of the means of sequential observations for each rater by establishing the z-value. Inter-rater reliability within each group was established by means of analysis of variance. Results: Considering all the data, in only 17 instances (of the possible 60), did observers’ mean scores not differ from the control mean scores with good intra-rater reliability. In all other 43 instances the observers’ mean scores differed from the control mean scores and/or displayed poor intra-rater reliability. Considerable variation in inter-rater reliability was also found within every group of observers.
