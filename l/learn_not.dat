The school was run along radical lines inspired by Hill's friends Thomas Paine, Richard Price and Joseph Priestley; all teaching was on the principle that the teacher's role is to instill the desire to <b>learn,</b> <b>not</b> to impart facts, corporal punishment was abolished and alleged transgressions were tried by a court of pupils, while the school taught a radical (for the time) curriculum including foreign languages, science and engineering. Among other pupils, the school taught the sons of many London-based diplomats, particularly from the newly independent nations of South America, and the sons of computing pioneer Charles Babbage.|$|E

500|$|Music critic Bruce Eder, in {{a review}} for the AllMusic website, wrote the Beach Boys [...] "brush up against {{the dark side of}} the '60s, in the form of 'Never <b>Learn</b> <b>Not</b> to Love'". In his {{assessment}} of the song, Richie Unterberger commented [...] "Never <b>Learn</b> <b>Not</b> to Love" [...] is far more notorious for its relation to Manson, not the music itself which he describes as [...] "average". Author Carl Larkin, in his book The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, wrote the track [...] "had the ironic distinction of putting Charles Manson in the charts". Journalist Nathan Jolly called the song [...] "softer but still eerie", also noting how fans of the Beach Boys who listened to the song over the years [...] "had no idea of the inherent evil of its actual composer". Throughout the years, [...] "Never <b>Learn</b> <b>Not</b> to Love" [...] has appeared on several other Beach Boys compilations and bootlegs.|$|E
500|$|... "Never <b>Learn</b> <b>Not</b> to Love" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by the American rock band the Beach Boys, credited to Dennis Wilson, and released as the B-side to the group's [...] "Bluebirds over the Mountain" [...] single on December 2, 1968. In 1969, [...] "Never <b>Learn</b> <b>Not</b> to Love" [...] was included on the Beach Boys' 15th studio album 20/20. The song was actually an altered version of [...] "Cease to Exist", composed by aspiring folk singer-songwriter and later convicted murder-conspirator Charles Manson. Musically, Wilson deviated from Manson's blues influence, reworking it to fit the band's pop-oriented approach.|$|E
500|$|A {{level of}} intrigue {{surrounds}} the song chiefly because of Manson's hand in its creation and his brief relationship with Wilson. Soon {{after the release}} of [...] "Never <b>Learn</b> <b>Not</b> to Love", Manson, along with his [...] "Family", was infamously convicted of several murders. Manson himself recorded the original arrangement of the song for his debut album , released in March 1970. Reception toward [...] "Never <b>Learn</b> <b>Not</b> to Love" [...] is often mixed, considering its sinister background, but music critics credit Manson's rendition as his most accomplished work. Since its original distribution, the song appears on several compilation albums by the Beach Boys.|$|E

500|$|Hotel Chevalier {{was one of}} the year's most {{discussed}} short films, {{and attracted}} considerable praise from film critics, who compared it favorably to The Darjeeling Limited.

[...] Armond White of New York Press judged the short [...] "moving and genuinely contemporary", citing its [...] "lost-girl poignancy". The film drew some attention for co-star Natalie Portman's extended nude scene, and for her character's bruised body. Portman expressed disappointment at this undue focus, saying [...] "t really depressed me that half of every review … was about the nudity". The episode made the actress reconsider the wisdom of this aspect of her performance, and she subsequently swore off nude appearances in film.|$|E

When Wilson acquired the song from him, for the most part, he abided Manson's original specifications. However, {{in an attempt to}} better accommodate the group's trademark vocal harmonies, Wilson reworked the song's bluesy structure and added another bridge. In addition, [...] "Cease to Exist"'s lyrics were also partially altered (most notably the opening lyric [...] "Cease to exist" [...] to [...] "Cease to resist"), and the title of the song was changed to [...] "Never <b>Learn</b> <b>Not</b> to Love" [...] as a result, much to Manson's indignation.

500|$|General George Washington, {{commander}} in chief of the Continental Army, came to Philadelphia to brief Congress on military affairs. [...] Lafayette met him at a dinner on 5 August 1777; according to Leepson, [...] "the two men bonded almost immediately." [...] Washington was impressed by the young man's enthusiasm and was inclined to think well of a fellow Mason; Lafayette was simply in awe of the commanding general. General Washington took the Frenchman to view his military camp; when Washington expressed embarrassment at its state and that of the troops, Lafayette responded, [...] "I am here to <b>learn,</b> <b>not</b> to teach." [...] He became a member of Washington's staff, although confusion existed regarding his status. Congress regarded his commission as honorary, while he considered himself a full-fledged commander who would be given control of a division when Washington deemed him prepared. Washington told Lafayette that a division would not be possible as he was of foreign birth, but that he would be happy to hold him in confidence as [...] "friend and father".|$|E

In a review entitled Vivid Action Can't Save Miscast 'Joan, Todd McCarthy praised the film's action scenes and technical aspects, including Thierry Arbogast's cinematography, though overall gave a negative review. He criticised the casting of Jovovich, stating {{the only thing she}} brought to the film was [...] "her strikingly tall and skinny physicality, which is not exactly how one has been led to picture [...] ". Ron Wells from Film Threat, however, gave the film four out of five stars. Also praising the action scenes, Wells stated that the film's main strength was its [...] "adult ambiguities and relationships"; its decision not to portray Joan as a [...] "super-hero", but rather to let the audience decide whether she was a prophet or merely bipolar, concluding, [...] "This film, as most things that involve religion, is better understood if you <b>learn</b> <b>not</b> to take everything so literally." ...|$|E
