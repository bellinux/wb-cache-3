Overall, the majority of participants declared that they had best friends; in the total sample, {{significant differences were found between}} women and men, and between lesbian/gay men participants and heterosexual young adults. <b>Lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> participants reported more cross-gender best friendships than heterosexual participants did, as well as more cross-orientation best friendships. Gender differences were found only with regards to cross-gender friendships: <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> reported more cross-gender friendships than lesbians did, while heterosexual females reported a higher percentage of cross-gender best friendship than heterosexual males did. MANOVA analysis, only in the <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> sample, showed the effect of gender, cross-gender, and cross-orientation on well-being and social anxiety. For the well-being dimension, <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> participants with female best friends reported higher scores.

40|$|Thesis (M. Soc. Sci.) -University of Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2000. Prejudice can {{be defined}} as the {{possession}} of negative attitudes or beliefs that have the potential for people to behave in a discriminatory or hostile manner toward a person because they belong to a certain group. It is believed that attitudes are passed on and communicated inter-generationally. In this context attitudes were examined in a sample of Grade 12 pupils and their parents to establish whether there was a relationship between adolescents and parents attitudes toward homosexuals. Results support the hypothesis that parents' attitudes impact on daughters' attitudes but more specifically that daughters' attitudes are more closely related to mothers' attitudes than they are to fathers' attitudes. Findings for the Attitude Toward <b>Lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gay</b> <b>men</b> scale revealed that respondents demonstrated more negative attitudes toward <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> than they did toward lesbians, with male respondents (fathers) being more homophobic than females (mothers and daughters).

Voters supported repealing the gay rights ordinance by a margin of more than two to one. Bryant danced a jig when the response was announced, and told reporters [...] "All America and all the world will hear what the people have said, and with God's continued help, we will prevail in our fight to repeal similar laws throughout the nation which attempt to legitimize a life style that is both perverse and dangerous".

500|$|A {{belief in}} [...] "lesbian & gay separatism" [...] (not to be {{confused}} with the related [...] "lesbian separatism"), holds that <b>lesbians</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> form (or should form) a community distinct and separate from other groups normally included in the LGBTQ sphere. While not always appearing of sufficient number or organization to be called a movement, separatists are a significant, vocal, and active element within many parts of the LGBT community. In some cases separatists will deny the existence or right to equality of nonmonosexual orientations and of transsexuality. This can extend to public biphobia and transphobia. In contrasts to separatists, Peter Tatchell of the LGBT human rights group OutRage! argues that to separate the transgender movement from the LGB would be [...] "political madness", stating that [...] "Queers are, like transgender people, gender deviant. We donâ€™t conform to traditional heterosexist assumptions of male and female behaviour, in that we have sexual and emotional relationships with the same sex.

500|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began {{to reflect the}} changes {{prompted}} by {{the civil rights movement}} and the emergence of a counterculture. [...] Within the genres, these changes were incorporated into a movement called [...] "the New Wave," [...] a movement more sceptical of technology, more liberated socially, and more interested in stylistic experimentation. New Wave writers were more likely to claim an interest in [...] "inner space" [...] instead of outer space. They were less shy about explicit sexuality and more sympathetic to reconsiderations of gender roles and the social status of sexual minorities. Under the influence of New Wave editors and authors such as Michael Moorcock (editor of the influential New Worlds), sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality and gender multiplied in science fiction and fantasy, becoming commonplace. The introduction of gay imagery has also been attributed to the influence of lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements in the 1960s. In the 1970s, <b>lesbians</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> became a more visible presence in the SF community and as writers; notable gay authors included Joanna Russ, Thomas M.

With a Nielsen rating of 8.6, equivalent to approximately 8.4 million viewing households, it was the fifteenth-highest-rated show on NBC the week it aired. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Joyce Millman of Salon Entertainment said the episode has [...] "glimmers of class" [...] and the jokes are [...] "relatively sophisticated". John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle commented that Burrows's direction was [...] "sharp as usual" [...] and the writing was [...] "above average". Brian Lambert of the St. Paul Pioneer Press said the pilot was [...] "nicely staged by veteran director Jimmy Burrows, and coming from a couple producers, Max Mutchnick and David Cohan, who assisted Boston Common and Dream On, the show â€“ {{which is to say}} the pilot episode (everything could go to hell next week) â€“ has the best verbal interplay of any of the season's new sitcoms." [...] William Horn from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) thought the episode was a [...] "wonderful" [...] representation of a gay man's life [...] "regardless of whether he's in a relationship in that very moment. I think it's important that American audiences realize that <b>lesbians</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> are not simply all about sexual situations." [...] Ellen Gray of the Chicago Tribune was also positive about the show: [...] "For those who believe that Hollywood's engaging in a conspiracy to 'normalize' a sexual orientation that many Americans still find abhorrent, Will & Grace will look like a candy-coated poison pill. To those who think that Hollywood isn't moving fast enough in offering sexual parity for gays, it may just look like poison. But... there's a large audience out there that's somewhere in the mushy middle, an audience that might be ready to embrace Will & Grace." ...|$|E
