25|$|Many {{countries}} have a smoking age. In many countries, including the United States, most European Union member states, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, Israel, India, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica and Australia, {{it is illegal}} to sell tobacco products to minors and in the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Denmark and South Africa {{it is illegal to}} sell tobacco products to people under the age of 16. On 1 September 2007 the minimum age to buy tobacco products in Germany rose from 16 to 18, {{as well as in the}} United Kingdom where on 1 October 2007 it rose from 16 to 18. Underlying such laws is the belief that people should make an informed decision regarding the risks of tobacco use. These laws have a lax enforcement in some nations and states. In China, Turkey, and many other countries usually a child will have <b>little</b> <b>problem</b> buying tobacco products, because they are often told to go to the store to buy tobacco for their parents.|$|E

In many areas, he himself had noted that where anopheline vectors were abundant, malaria {{was not at all}} prevalent, and sometimes absent. This caused a <b>little</b> <b>problem</b> in understanding malaria epidemiology for some time. In fact, in 1919 he identified three typical malaria prevalent localities, but which were not affected by malaria in the same way, such as the gardens of Schito near Naples, Massarosa in Tuscany, and Alberone in Lombardia. In 1921, after repeated assessment, he concluded with the assumption of the existence of races of Anopheles, that there were morphologically indistinguishable mosquitoes that do not bite humans, and that therefore did not play a role as vectors.|$|E

40|$|The <b>little</b> Grothendieck <b>problem</b> {{consists}} of maximizing ∑[subscript ij]C[subscript ij]x[subscript i]x[subscript j] for a {{positive semidefinite matrix}} C, over binary variables x[subscript i]∈{± 1 }. In this paper we focus on a natural generalization of this <b>problem,</b> the <b>little</b> Grothendieck <b>problem</b> over the orthogonal group. Given C∈R[superscript dn×dn] a positive semidefinite matrix, {{the objective is to}} maximize ∑[subscript ij]tr(C[superscript T][subscript ij]O[subscript i]O[superscript T][subscript j] restricting O[subscript i] to take values in the group of orthogonal matrices O[subscript d], where C[subscript ij] denotes the (ij) -th d×d block of C. We propose an approximation algorithm, which we refer to as Orthogonal-Cut, to solve the <b>little</b> Grothendieck <b>problem</b> over the group of orthogonal matrices O[subscript d] and show a constant approximation ratio. Our method is based on semidefinite programming. For a given d≥ 1, we show a constant approximation ratio of α[subscript R](d) [superscript 2], where α[subscript R](d) is the expected average singular value of a d×d matrix with random Gaussian N(0, 1 /d) i. i. d. entries. For d= 1 we recover the known α[subscript R](1) [superscript 2]= 2 /π approximation guarantee for the classical <b>little</b> Grothendieck <b>problem.</b> Our algorithm and analysis naturally extends to the complex valued case also providing a constant approximation ratio for the analogous <b>little</b> Grothendieck <b>problem</b> over the Unitary Group U[subscript d]. Orthogonal-Cut also serves as an approximation algorithm for several applications, including the Procrustes problem where it improves over the best previously known approximation ratio of 1 / 2 √ 2. The <b>little</b> Grothendieck <b>problem</b> falls under the larger class of problems approximated by a recent algorithm proposed {{in the context of the}} non-commutative Grothendieck inequality. Nonetheless, our approach is simpler and provides better approximation with matching integrality gaps.
