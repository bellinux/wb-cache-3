40|$|<b>Locational</b> <b>policy</b> is {{the effort}} of local {{stakeholders}} to create a favourable environment for business activities. It aims at improving the locational quality, so that existing companies may become more competitive, entrepreneurs find it attractive to start their business in the location and external investors prefer it in their locational decision. Moreover, it includes pro-active measures to stimulate and support the competitiveness of companies, and to shape structural change. In other words, <b>locational</b> <b>policy</b> is about upgrading – both of local companies and the location as such. However, determining exactly what upgrading means for companies is a dif-ficult exercise, in particular in terms of direction, as upgrading {{does not necessarily mean}} moving upwards. Moreover, the contribution <b>locational</b> <b>policy</b> can make to companies ’ up-grading efforts is strongly influenced by the stage of the respective industrial life-cycle. The ultimate justification for <b>locational</b> <b>policy</b> is globalisation. Yet, globalisation is creating difficulties for <b>locational</b> <b>policy</b> in two ways. First, the integration of local economies into global value chains creates obstacles for local collective action and <b>locational</b> <b>policy</b> (the “irony of upgrading”).

40|$|This paper {{advances}} the multi-mechanism framework, integrates the GIS {{technology and}} spatial panel data models for analyzing regional inequality mechanism. Applying this integrated methodology, we investigate China&# 39;s regional inequality {{at the county}} level using a comprehensive panel dataset that includes socioeconomic, environmental, <b>locational,</b> <b>policy</b> and GIS data from 1992 to 2010. The results show that Chinese regional inequality at the county level has a non-stationary dynamic structure, mirroring global inequality and spatial autocorrelation. In addition, the spatial panel data models analysis reveals the relative influence of explanatory variables. The impact of essential productive factors on regional development is gradually fading. Industrialization and decentralization play the most important role. The influence of marketization on regional development is not clear. The expansion of urban built-up areas has exerted a strong influence on the uneven regional development. Policy and transportation factor plays an indispensable role in regional inequality. The analysis additionally recognizes that socioeconomic factors play a dominant role, beyond policy and location factors. The role of environmental factors appears to be masked. This paper suggests that more attention needs {{to be paid to}} micro-inequality to coordinate inter-county and intra-county inequality under the pressure of rapid industrialization, urbanization and modernization of agriculture. Given the pattern of economic development, deepening balanced development reforms, optimizing and upgrading the industrial structure might be effective ways to develop a more coordinated regional development structure in China at the county level. </p...|$|E
40|$|Development {{planning}} {{is growing in}} popularity among countries of the third world. However, this kind of planning pays little attention to regional dimensions of growth. There is a striking similarity of the said situation {{in the third world}} with that existing in the developed countries in their earlier stages of growth. Yet, strong arguments speak in favour of a different approach in this respect. The labour market of the developing countries has distinct regional features, which call for a separate treatment of each region. The economic and social infrastructure, necessary as a base for any acceleration of growth, must be analyzed in a regional context in order to be expanded in an efficient way and in the most desired direction. Finally, the process of industrialization, which no developing country can afford to bypass on its path to higher income requires a <b>locational</b> <b>policy</b> of agglomeration in order to generate external economics as means to overcome obstacles to faster development. In order to play the required role regional planning must be integrated with national development planning and be treated as equal to sectoral planning. It should cover all regions and not only those which offer the best prospects of positively influencing the rate of growth. This {{does not necessarily mean that}} the growth rate of all regions should be equal. Two stages of work are proposed for regional planning within the framework of national developmen planning: one concerned with project identification and the other with project selection.

Small and medium-sized cities {{have to find ways}} to position themselves in global markets by formulating <b>locational</b> <b>policies.</b> This paper outlines an analytical framework of <b>locational</b> <b>policies</b> that cities adopt in order to increase their competitiveness. By comparing two European small and mediumsized cities (Lucerne and Ulm), we examine manifestations of <b>locational</b> <b>policies</b> and compare if these policies are being diverse or resemble each other. We found that strategies of both cities are sharing the intentions to be competitive, but their policy choices differ because the economic and political context is enabling or restricting certain kinds of <b>locational</b> <b>policies.</b> Furthermore, the findings point to the high explanatory power of municipal tax autonomy when studying <b>locational</b> <b>policies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Die Rahmenbedingungen für die Positionierung Hamburgs im internationalen und nationalen Standortwettbewerb befinden sich im permanenten Wandel. Von hoher Relevanz hierfür ist der wissensbasierte Strukturwandel, welcher insbesondere in den Städten zur Entstehung neuer Arbeitsplätze beiträgt. Wichtige Standortfaktoren für die Unternehmen der Wissenswirtschaft sind qualifizierte Arbeitskräfte und regionale Kapazitäten in der Forschung und Entwicklung. Die Hansestadt hat bereits im Jahr 2003 mit dem Leitbild "Metropole Hamburg - Wachsende Stadt" auf diese neuen standortpolitischen Herausforderungen reagiert. Im Jahr 2010 hat der Hamburger Senat mit "Wachsen mit Weitsicht" ein neues Leitbild für die Stadtentwicklung beschlossen, welches Schwerpunkte auf die Förderung und Anziehung von Talenten sowie auf Bildung legt. Insgesamt zeigt die Implementierung der jüngeren standortpolitischen Strategien in Hamburg eine Erweiterung der Handlungskonzepte um neue Aspekte, was zur Stärkung der Position Hamburgs im internationalen Metropolenwettbewerb und als Wissensstandort beitragen soll. The {{framework}} {{conditions for}} the international and national competitive positioning of Hamburg are continuously changing. Of great relevance {{in this context is}} knowledge based structural change that, particularly in the cities, contributes to the creation of new jobs. Important locational factors for knowledge based businesses are a qualified workforce and regional research and development capacities. Hamburg reacted early to these new competitive challenges with the guiding principle “Metropole Hamburg – Wachsende Stadt” (“Metropolis Hamburg – Growing City”) of 2003. In 2010 the Hamburg Senate then passed “Wachsen mit Weitsicht” (“Growth with Vision”), a new guiding principle for urban development that focused on promoting and attracting talent and education. Overall the implementation of the recent <b>locational</b> <b>policy</b> strategies in Hamburg demonstrates a broadening of action concepts to include new aspects. This is intended to strengthen Hamburg’s position in international competition between metropolises and increase its importance as a knowledge centre...|$|E
40|$|The {{system of}} {{physical}} distribution that comprises transport and logistics, warehousing and wholesale, {{is an ideal}} indicator of structural change. Distribution and logistics have developed dynamically, with respect to new technologies, corporate restructuring, and a changing market environment. Whereas traditional logistics were characterized primarily by the demand of manufacturing customers for the shipment of bulk-commodities, modern production and service systems require frequent deliveries over great distances, with high inventory turnovers instead of storage. As a consequence, the locational profiles of distribution firms have changed as well, both at a large-scale level and within metropolitan regions. Based on recent findings of the European Warehousing Index, the paper points out how the European system of goods movement has changed in terms of regional distribution markets and warehousing location. Secondly, the consequences of locational dynamics within metropolitan regions are considered. The dominance {{of the truck and}} the suburbanisation of large distribution centres raise serious concern about logistics management, traffic reduction and <b>locational</b> <b>policy.</b> Referring to selected places such as the Ruhr Area, Hamburg or Berlin-Brandenburg, the paper demonstrates how critical the relationship between cities and goods distribution is becoming, with regard both to the regional economy and the urban environment. Is there a chance for regional, spatially oriented management of supply chains? In the case of the Ruhr Area, it is also questioned whether a certain 'knowledge milieu' (logistics research, applied sciences) may contribute to this goal. The particular benefits of investigating logistics real estate markets are fourfold: - They allow for a precise insight into regionally differentiated developments. - They connect the system of 'flows' with material 'space'. - They demonstrate that structural change is by no means neutral for the environment, regarding specific transport and land use implications of distribution. - They represent the emergence of new players in land use planning and policy (i. e. developers), thus shaping the system of political regulation. ...|$|E

The results indicate that the majority of eligibility spells are relatively short, do not result in program participation, and end with increases in income. Participation is most likely to occur among women with lower current and future earning opportunities, and is also affected by <b>locational</b> and <b>policy</b> parameters. Those who elect to participate in these programs tend to start receiving benefits almost immediately upon becoming eligible. with little evidence of delayed program entry. A substantial number of women exit these programs before their eligibility ends; among at least some of these women it seems likely that there are unreported changes in income occurring.

As legalization unfolds, the experiences of local governments will inform {{the development and implementation}} of effective land use regulatory mechanisms. The study population for this research was all 23 jurisdictions within the five most populated counties that had adopted interim or permanent recreational marijuana land use ordinances. Content analysis methodology was used to explore how counties and municipalities were addressing legalization. Local land use ordinances were evaluated using six indicator categories derived from the literature on other controversial land uses: Fact Base, Goals, Definitions, <b>Locational</b> Control <b>Policies,</b> Operational Control Policies, and Other. With no past experience and facing an uncertain legal environment, wide differences existed in how these local governments have approached recreational marijuana legalization.

40|$|The asset-based {{approach}} considers {{links between}} households'productive, social, and <b>locational</b> assets; the <b>policy,</b> institutional, and risk context; household behavior {{as expressed in}} livelihood strategies; and well-being outcomes. For sustainable poverty reducing growth, {{it is critical to}} examine household asset portfolios and understand how assets interact with the context to influence the selection of livelihood strategies, which in turn determine well-being. Policy reforms can change the context and income-generating potential of assets. Investments can add new assets or increase the efficiency of existing household assets, and also improve households'risk management capacity to protect assets. After all is said and done, a household's asset portfolio will determine whether growth and poverty reduction can be achieved and sustained over time. The asset-based framework is amendable to different analytical techniques. Siegel suggests combining quantitative and qualitative spatial and household level analyses (and linked spatial and household level analyses) to deepen understanding of the complex relationships between assets, context, livelihood strategies, and well-being outcomes.

40|$|China {{has become}} one of the world's biggest source of outward FDI in the past decade. A fair amount of {{literature}} have emerged explaining home determinants of China's outward FDI at country- and firm-level. Our study attempts to examine drivers of China's overseas investment from a fresh angle – China's regional outward FDI. While central outward FDI is made by large central firms which are directly supervised and managed by the State Council, regional outward FDI is from regional firms that are owned by regional governments and the private sector. The rising importance of regional outward FDI compared with central outward FDI warrants a thorough investigation on the former. We propose a theoretical framework that incorporates an extended Investment Development Path (IDP) theory, home <b>locational</b> constraints, <b>policy</b> incentives and geographic factors. Many variables examined in our study have never been introduced previously to analyse China's outward FDI. Empirically, we employ the Bayesian Averaging Maximum Likelihood Estimates method to address model uncertainty. This is the first time this method is used in FDI literature. All proposed theories (except the geographic factors) are found to capture important perspectives explaining China's regional outward FDI. Our results particularly highlight the importance of government policies (presence of SOEs, willingness to approve local outward FDI, and investment in R&D), but do not support the original IDP hypothesis that outward investment is automatically generated as income grows. We found two variables based on the extended IDP theory, namely trade openness and agglomeration effect to be robust determinants. Pollution is the only home locational constraint that is robust, and geographic factors have little impact on regional outward FDI. Our findings have both regional and central policy implications. Central policy makers need to recognise that local outward investment may response to different set of factors compared with central investment abroad and take this into account when setting outward FDI policies. At regional level, our study provides direct reference on tools local government can employ to facilitate outward investment...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{partnership}} arrangements involving {{public and private}} sector and community representation have been created in many countries in recent years with local and regional economic development, place marketing and regeneration remits. This research examines partnerships that are concerned specifically {{with the development of}} tourism in England. Various forms of partnership for tourism development in England and elsewhere continue to emerge and evolve {{in the early years of}} the 21 st century. This study investigates the pre-conditions, processes and outcomes of such partnership arrangements. The study also examines the political, environmental and socio-economic influences that may affect local tourism development partnerships in England. It does so through an integrated conceptual framework that combines theoretical perspectives on resource, and political and institutional considerations in an evaluation of such partnerships. The roles of individual partnership members are also evaluated. This study suggests that the conceptual framework developed for this research may be adopted for the analysis of tourism development partnerships elsewhere. This research involves the critical study of partnerships through the integration of both policy studies, and organisation studies perspectives. Theories developed to account for inter-organisational collaboration are given particular prominence in this research. Additionally, theories are also incorporated from political geography, and from institutional theory. It is shown that all of these approaches are relevant and applicable to the study of tourism development partnerships. Theories developed to account for organisational partnerships have been applied to empirical studies in a number of <b>policy,</b> <b>locational</b> and business contexts in recent years. However, there has been comparatively little work that has developed an inter-organisational collaboration theoretical framework in the study of tourism development partnerships. Therefore, this research contributes to knowledge in relation to an emerging and important subject in the field of tourism studies. The methodology in this study is qualitative, centring upon an intensive analysis of three local tourism development partnerships, including a pilot study, and involves the use of interviews with key actors and documentary analysis. Theories of interorganisational collaboration inform the research design and analytical framework and contribute towards the development of an integrated theory of partnerships in the context of tourism development. The approach adopted here is transferable to the examination of inter-organisational collaboration and partnerships both within and beyond the field of tourism. Therefore, the methodology developed for this research has considerable potential for substantive application elsewhere. The study concludes with a comparative analysis and evaluation of the findings from the three case studies in this research. The implications of these findings for future research on partnerships are highlighted. The implications of this study for the development of theory and methods for researching tourism development partnerships are also suggested...|$|R
