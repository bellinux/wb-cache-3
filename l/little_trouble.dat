5|$|Based on observations, Iridomyrmex {{workers can}} be {{deformed}} {{when they are}} born. For example, a captured specimen had its propodeum and gaster fused together, and the petiole was still present but enlarged. Despite the deformity, the worker {{was still able to}} forage with <b>little</b> <b>trouble.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between the 30th and the 1st, The Sun {{reported}} that the remaining strikers had declared they would not interfere, but were confident the company {{would be unable to}} find sufficient workers without them, and that by remaining united, they could yet see their terms met. Given notice to report to work on Monday, July 30 or be discharged from the company, most chose discharge, but the company had <b>little</b> <b>trouble</b> in acquiring the workers needed to run the trains.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, Morris was bowled for 62, {{knocking}} a {{ball from}} Wright onto his stumps, after attempting a sweep {{from a long}} hop. This brought Bradman in to join Barnes. Yardley surrounded the Australian captain with fielders and Laker beat his bat thrice in an over. Bedser was brought in with the leg trap again in place as he bowled on Bradman's pads with the second new ball. The Australian captain decided to avoid the danger of being caught at short fine leg from a leg glance by padding the inswingers away with his front leg. Bedser responded by changing his tactics by bowling a series of outswingers, beating the outside edge of his bat {{three times in a}} row, narrowly missing the off stump on one occasion. Barnes responded by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had <b>little</b> <b>trouble</b> against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side and taking the shine off the new ball.|$|E

5|$|After lunch, Morris was bowled for 62. Bradman joined Barnes and the Australian skipper {{played and}} missed {{a few times}} before {{settling}} down. Barnes responded to his captain's difficulties by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had <b>little</b> <b>trouble</b> against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side and taking the shine off the second new ball. Generally however, Barnes also scored sedately after lunch, and after one extended period of defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, eliciting a round of ironic applause. Barnes responded to the public gallery by placing {{his hand on his}} chest and bowing to the spectators. Barnes had started slowly, but accelerated after reaching his half-century. He reached 96 with Australia at 1/222 half an hour after tea. By this time, the pace of the pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.|$|E
5|$|He {{utilised}} unique tactical formations, {{which earned}} him comparisons to Martin O'Neill. He was particularly experimental {{with the front}} line, and was willing to use the loan market to bring in fresh talent. On 24 March, it was announced Gannon would leave Peterborough {{at the end of}} the season. Unable to avoid relegation despite a vast upturn in results, he announced that family commitments made him unwilling to stay for longer. Gannon had been satisfied with the board's contract offer, but his family still resided in Stockport. He was replaced by Gary Johnson on 6 April, following Gannon's own recommendation of Johnson. Though Gannon insisted that this was not ultimately his decision, but instead was down to the board. Striker Liam Dickinson was sad to seem him go, and told the media that Gannon would have <b>little</b> <b>trouble</b> finding a new management post.|$|E
5|$|Yakovlev {{was able}} to adapt the two {{existing}} prototypes to the RD-10 with <b>little</b> <b>trouble</b> and one aircraft participated in the August 1946 Tushino flypast. The day after the aerial display, Joseph Stalin summoned Artem Mikoyan and Aleksandr Yakovlev to his office and ordered that each OKB build 15 aircraft {{to participate in the}} 7 November parade in Red Square commemorating the anniversary of the October Revolution. Factory No. 31 in Tblisi was chosen to build the new aircraft because it was still building conventional Yak-3s and could easily switch to the jet fighter. All 15 aircraft were built before the deadline, although they lacked any armour, were provided with an enlarged fuel tank in lieu of armament, and had an incomplete avionics outfit. The parade was canceled and two of the aircraft were modified with a single 23mm cannon and began State acceptance trials which lasted until April 1947.|$|E

5|$|Australia batted {{much more}} productively {{in the second}} innings in ideal weather on the third day. Morris and Barnes put on 122 before the former fell for 62. Bradman joined Barnes at the crease for his last Test innings {{at the home of}} cricket. Yardley {{surrounded}} the Australian captain with fielders and Laker then beat his bat thrice in an over. Bedser was then introduced with the leg trap ploy again in place as he bowled on Bradman's pads. The Australian captain decided to negate the danger of being caught glancing at short fine leg by padding the ball away with his front leg. Bedser responded by changing his tactics by bowling a series of outswingers, beating the outside edge of Bradman's bat three times in a row, narrowly missing the off stump on one occasion. Barnes then manipulated the strike to shield his captain from Bedser. The Australian opener had <b>little</b> <b>trouble</b> against the leg trap, and negated the danger Bedser was posing. Bradman accelerated after tea and took two consecutive boundaries from Wright to bring up his fifty, with Barnes on 96 and Australia at 1/222.|$|E

25|$|The early Go-Go V was a {{rigid frame}} machine, discontinued, {{but after the}} {{introduction}} of the Go-Go VA, four new machines were added to the UK market in 1974 and two more in 1976. By this time the company had a reputation for quality machines, which, while not the cheapest, were good to look at and offered <b>little</b> <b>trouble.</b>|$|E

West Germany awaited in the final.|$|E
25|$|The USA {{team had}} <b>little</b> <b>trouble</b> with Mali {{in the final}} game of the {{preliminary}} round. Four bench players had more minutes than the starter with e most minutes, but the USA team still managed to set a record for the largest margin of victory in U17 history, admittedly brief, as it only goes back to 2010. The final score was 98–28.|$|E
25|$|Because Lyndon Johnson {{had been}} elected to the {{presidency}} only once, in 1964, and had served less than two full years of the term before that, the 22nd Amendment did not disqualify him from running for another term. As a result, it was widely assumed when 1968 began that President Johnson would run for another term, {{and that he would}} have <b>little</b> <b>trouble</b> winning the Democratic nomination.|$|E

25|$|England's second innings was {{anchored}} by Smith (84*), but around him the batting failed, collapsing to 59/4 before Smith, Ramprakash and Lewis steadied the innings, but eventually {{only able to}} muster 174. Waqar (5–52) was the principle destroyer, picking up the first four wickets and finishing it off by bowling Malcolm, and Wasim (3–36) again picked up the tail with <b>little</b> <b>trouble.</b> Sohail knocked off the runs from Ramprakash's first legitimate delivery.|$|E
25|$|Laplace had a wide {{knowledge}} of all sciences and dominated all discussions in the Académie. Laplace {{seems to have}} regarded analysis merely {{as a means of}} attacking physical problems, though the ability with which he invented the necessary analysis is almost phenomenal. As long as his results were true he took but <b>little</b> <b>trouble</b> to explain the steps by which he arrived at them; he never studied elegance or symmetry in his processes, and it was sufficient for him if he could by any means solve the particular question he was discussing.|$|E
25|$|The {{abuses of}} the hacienda system and the caciques made the area ripe for the insurgent {{movement}} under Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla. In 1810, José María Morelos y Pavón passed through the Costa Grande from Michoacán {{in order to take}} Acapulco, having <b>little</b> <b>trouble</b> recruiting soldiers. However, many hacienda owners were also recruited, especially in Tecpan and Coyuca, mostly due to strong nationalist and anti-Spanish sentiment among criollos in the area. For the most part, the Costa Grande would remain in insurgent hands, with a major insurgent headquarters in Tecpan, which was a province created by Morelos himself in 1811.|$|E

25|$|In Hamburg {{one evening}} in January 1826 Heine met , who would be his chief {{publisher}} {{for the rest of}} his life. Their stormy relationship has been compared to a marriage. Campe was a liberal who published as many dissident authors as he could. He had developed various techniques for evading the authorities. The laws of the time stated that any book under 320 pages had to be submitted to censorship (the authorities thought long books would cause <b>little</b> <b>trouble</b> as they were unpopular). One way around censorship was to publish dissident works in large print to increase the number of pages beyond 320.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the war, Featherston drifts for a short while, before joining the newly created Freedom Party. Featherston establishes himself as head propagandist, and eventually becomes its leader, aided by Party member Ferdinand Koenig. With his raw energy and humble origins, Featherston has <b>little</b> <b>trouble</b> whipping up support from much of the Confederate populace, and it seems by the early 1920s that he would surely be leading the country. But with the assassination of President Wade Hampton V in June 1922 by a Party stalwart, the Freedom Party suffers a sudden and near-total collapse as a political force.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{undermining}} missteps of his relatives, the regent Peter of Coimbra {{was determined}} to undertake the swap, and he dispatched two emissaries, Martim Tavora and Gomes Eanes, to Asilah to negotiate the logistics. As a preliminary, Abu Bakr demanded that the governor of Ceuta, Fernando de Noronha, be relieved from office – his reputation was such that the Moroccans believed Noronha would contrive to prevent the swap. Peter had <b>little</b> <b>trouble</b> agreeing to it – the Noronha family, closely allied with the Braganzas, were among Peter's keenest political enemies; indeed, Noronha's brothers had led the conspiracy of nobles which tried to deprive Peter of the regency back in 1438.|$|E
