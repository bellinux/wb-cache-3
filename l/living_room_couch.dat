500|$|Adams {{prefers to}} work from a plot rather than from a full script, a result of Ann Nocenti's dense Longshot scripts, though he has worked from a full script, as with his work on Three Dimensional Alien Worlds for Pacific Comics and The Authority. Though he says he prefers group books because they more easily allow him to hide his [...] "bad layout skills", he is {{nonetheless}} comfortable with solo character books. He begins drawing thumbnail layouts from the story he is given, either {{at home or in}} a public place. The thumbnails range in size from 2inches x 3inches to half the size of the printed comic book. He or an assistant will then enlarge the thumbnails and trace them onto illustration board with a non-photo blue pencil, sometimes using a Prismacolor light blue pencil, because it is not too waxy, and erases easily. When working on the final illustration board, he does so on a large drawing board when in his basement studio, and a lapboard when sitting on his <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>couch.</b> After tracing the thumbnails, he will then clarify details with another light blue pencil, and finalize the details with a Number 2 pencil. He drew the first three chapters of [...] "Jonni Future" [...] at twice the printed comic size, and also drew the fifth chapter, [...] "The Garden of the Sklin", at a size larger than standard, in order to render more detail than usual in those stories. For a large poster image with a multitude of characters, he will go over the figure outlines with a marker in order to emphasize them. He will use photographic reference when appropriate, as when he draws things that he is not accustomed to.|$|E

40|$|AbstractConcentrations of {{a number}} of {{organophosphate}} flame retardants (PFRs) were measured in floor dust collected from <b>living</b> <b>rooms</b> in Australia (n =  42), Canada (n =  14), Germany (n =  22), and Kazakhstan (n =  9); cars from Australia (n =  39) and Germany (n =  19); and offices from Germany (n =  25) and Kazahkstan (n =  8). PFR concentrations in these samples were compared {{with each other and with}} previously reported data for PFRs in dust from similar microenvironments in the UK. Our data reveal significant between-country differences in both absolute concentrations and the relative abundance of specific PFRs in each of the microenvironments studied. Most notably, concentrations of TCIPP in UK <b>living</b> <b>room</b> dust (median =  21  μg g− 1) exceeded significantly (p <  0. 05) those in all other countries studied here; a substantial number of car dust samples contained elevated concentrations of TDCIPP, and German samples generally contained lower levels of PFRs in all microenvironments studied. In addition, PFRs were determined in dust samples collected from <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>couches</b> in both Australia (n =  41) and the UK (n =  10). The elevated concentrations of TCIPP in UK <b>living</b> <b>room</b> dust are likely attributable to the favoured use of this PFR in UK couch foam. This is indicated by concentrations of TCIPP in UK couch dust (median =  610  μg g− 1) exceeding significantly those in Australian couch dust (median =  2. 9  μg g− 1). Moreover, concentrations of TCIPP in UK couch dust originating from couches 15 years old or less, display a marked relationship with the age of the couch, with concentrations in such samples increasing significantly (p <  0. 01) with couch age...|$|R

40|$|Figure 1. Using a {{projector}} {{and depth}} camera, the WorldKit system allows interfaces {{to operate on}} everyday surfaces, such as a <b>living</b> <b>room</b> table and <b>couch</b> (A). Applications can be created rapidly and easily, simply by “painting ” controls onto a desired location with one’s hand- a home entertainment system in the example above (B, C, and D). Touch-driven interfaces then appear on the environment, which can be immediately accessed by the user (E). Instant access to computing, when and where we need it, has long {{been one of the}} aims of research areas such as ubiquitous computing. In this paper, we describe the WorldKit system, which makes use of a paired depth cam-era and projector to make ordinary surfaces instantly inter-active. Using this system, touch-based interactivity can, without prior calibration, be placed on nearly any unmodi-fied surface literally with a wave of the hand, as can other new forms of sensed interaction. From a user perspective, such interfaces are easy enough to instantiate that they could, if desired, be recreated or modified “each time we sat down ” by “painting ” them next to us. From the program-mer’s perspective, our system encapsulates these capabili-ties in a simple set of abstractions that make the creation of interfaces quick and easy. Further, it is extensible to new, custom interactors in a way that closely mimics conven-tional 2 D graphical user interfaces, hiding much of the complexity of working in this new domain. We detail the hardware and software implementation of our system, and several example applications built using the library.

Living room serves as a stage where dwellers reflect their identity to the outside world. In this study, the factors that affect the use and interior design of the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> are defined. According to these factors, the group differences in the use and interior design of the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> has been examined. A field survey was conducted in “Angora Evleri” which is an upper income suburb in Ankara. Results indicated that the existence of the family room affected the type, number and frequency of activities that were performed in the <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> The existence of the family room also affected the intentions for the interior design and the selected interior design elements in the <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> Moreover, the selected interior design elements in the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> varied according to different groups of users.
