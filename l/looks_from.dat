These included many real estate offices and homes {{such as those}} belonging to Marion and her sister. He also found a girl who looked just like he imagined Marion and photographed her whole wardrobe, which would enable Hitchcock to demand realistic <b>looks</b> <b>from</b> Helen Colvig, the wardrobe supervisor. The look of the Bates house was modeled on Edward Hopper's painting The House by the Railroad, a fanciful portrait of the Second Empire Victorian home at 18 Conger Avenue in Haverstraw, New York.|$|E
5|$|For the game's characters, the {{developers}} {{intended to keep}} the comical <b>looks</b> <b>from</b> the previous games, but they decided to update their appearances with realistic materials and textures {{to take advantage of}} the more powerful level of graphics capabilities of seventh-generation consoles. The designers first drew character sketches to determine the characters' looks and clothing, creating a main and an alternate outfit for each character, which were then made into reference artwork. Afterward, low-level meshes for each character were created, with details added with Zbrush, resulting in characters that, before being scaled down for the game environment, had more than six million polygons. Textures and pixel shaders were added using the team's previous work on Tony Hawk's Project 8 to match the style of earlier Guitar Hero games. Unlike the Tony Hawk games, each character in the game was given a unique skeleton to match their variations in sizes and shapes, allowing the animators to create unique moves for individual characters. Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock introduces three new characters modeled after real-life musicians. Slash, Tom Morello, and Bret Michaels, each performing one or more songs from their past recordings. All three were brought into the game using motion capture from the Motion Analysis Corporation.|$|E

5|$|Gaga did not preview {{the costumes}} {{for the tour}} until the opening night. There were seven outfits created for the show, all {{throughout}} the different segments. The first was a bejeweled leotard which had the Jeff Koons blue gazing ball attached in the middle; the ball was previously used in the album cover art for Artpop. Gaga accessorized the dress {{with a pair of}} feathered wings while wearing a blond bob wig reminiscent of her <b>looks</b> <b>from</b> The Fame era. A rave inspired outfit was worn for the last segment and consisted of colorful dreadlocks and legwarmers made of fur. She added a shirt consisting of straps and plastic sleeves with it. One of the complex outfits was made of latex and consisted of a polka dotted leotard and a number of tentacles attached to the dress as well as a headpiece with two tentacles from it.|$|E

25|$|Tiffany, Pat, {{and their}} friends and family arrive at the {{competition}} {{on the night of}} the football game. Tiffany despairs when she finds that Nikki actually is in the audience, invited by Ronnie and Veronica who want Nikki to lift her restraining order on Pat and give Pat the chance to reconcile with her. Tiffany walks to the bar and starts drinking. Pat finds her moments before their dance and drags her onto the dance floor. They begin their routine as the Eagles defeat the Dallas Cowboys. At the conclusion of their set, Tiffany and Pat score exactly 5 points. Amid cheers from friends and family and confused <b>looks</b> <b>from</b> the crowd, Pat approaches Nikki and speaks quietly into her ear. Tiffany sees this and runs off. Pat leaves Nikki behind after a short conversation, and chases Tiffany. He hands her a letter, in which he admits that he knows she forged Nikki's letter and confesses that he loved her from the moment he met her, though it took him so long to come to terms with it. They share a kiss. Patrizio opens a restaurant with the money he has won, Danny grows even closer to the Solitanos, and Pat and Tiffany begin a relationship, no longer wearing their wedding rings.|$|E

500|$|In 1995, Led Zeppelin were {{inducted}} into the United States Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Steven Tyler and Joe Perry of Aerosmith. Jason and Zoë Bonham also attended, representing their late father. At the induction ceremony, the band's inner rift became apparent when Jones joked upon accepting his award, [...] "Thank you, my friends, for finally remembering my phone number", causing consternation and awkward <b>looks</b> <b>from</b> Page and Plant.

500|$|Originally, {{the key was}} {{narrower}} than it {{is today}} and had the shape of a keyhole, measuring six feet (1.8m) wide, hence [...] "the key", with the free-throw circle as the head, and the shaded lane as the body. It has been also called [...] "cup" [...] or [...] "bottle" [...] in other languages, because of how it <b>looks</b> <b>from</b> other perspectives. Due to the narrowness of the key, imposing centers, such as George Mikan, dominated the paint, scoring at will. To counter this, the key was widened into 12feet (3.7m) from [...] {{at the onset of the}} 1951–52 NBA season.|$|E
500|$|Men {{typically}} wore a toga, {{and women}} a stola. The woman's stola differed in <b>looks</b> <b>from</b> a toga, and was usually brightly coloured. The cloth and the dress distinguished one {{class of people}} from the other class. The tunic worn by plebeians, or common people, like shepherds and slaves, was made from coarse and dark material, whereas the tunic worn by patricians was of linen or white wool. A knight or magistrate would wear an augusticlavus, a tunic bearing small purple studs. Senators wore tunics with broad red stripes, called tunica laticlavia. Military tunics were shorter than the ones worn by civilians. Boys, up until the festival of Liberalia, wore the toga praetexta, which was a toga with a crimson or purple border. The toga virilis (or toga pura) was worn by men over the age of 16 to signify their citizenship in Rome. The toga picta was worn by triumphant generals and had embroidery of their skill on the battlefield. The toga pulla was worn when in mourning.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} also {{included}} in the set list of her [...] tour, being the second track performed. The singer wore a bejeweled leotard which had the Jeff Koons blue gazing ball attached in the middle; the ball was previously used in the album cover art for Artpop. Gaga accessorized the dress with a pair of feathered wings while wearing a blond bob wig reminiscent of her <b>looks</b> <b>from</b> The Fame era. Following the performance of the album title song, [...] "Artpop", Gaga loosened the wings and was joined by her dancers on the ramp to perform [...] "G.U.Y." [...] During the intermediate verses Gaga performed a choreographed routine reminiscent of the music video with a dancer. The performance ended with the singer and the dancers reaching the main stage and dancing energetically. It received positive review from Ross Raihala of St. Paul Pioneer Press who said that the song sounded [...] "terrific" [...] in its live rendition. Chuck Yarborough from The Plain Dealer noticed that Gaga sang with a backing track during the performance of [...] "G.U.Y.", but concluded that [...] "she and a gifted crew of dancers kept up a manic pace that matched the frenzy of the evening".|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the mapping out of sequences, the episode features a short sequence that was shot {{to look as if}} it had been filmed during the show's second season, although the scene itself was filmed in 2011. Novak explained that, in order to recreate the shot, great lengths had to be taken to ensure the authenticity of the footage. Series Department Head make-up artist [...] LaVerne Caracuzzi-Milazzo and Hair Department Head [...] Kim M. Ferry [...] "put great care and effort into recreating the characters' <b>looks</b> <b>from</b> earlier seasons"; Novak, for instance wore [...] "the same bright blue shirt that Ryan used to favor" [...] and fake sideburns were glued onto the actor's face to [...] "match the era". He also stated that the actors [...] "remembered those dynamics [...] and fell right back into them." [...] This is not the first nor the last time this trick has been utilized on the show. For instance, during the cold opening for the sixth season episode [...] "Shareholder Meeting" [...] featuring [...] "Recyclops", a montage of Dwight harassing past receptionists was shown. Furthermore, the episode [...] "Customer Loyalty" [...] from the ninth season featured a montage of Jim setting up a prank supposedly during the show's second season.|$|E
500|$|A promotional teaser was {{released}} before the full {{release of the}} video; it saw Roberts walking on the New York City pavements, {{with a pair of}} backing dancers gaining <b>looks</b> <b>from</b> men. It also showed a neon-style aspect of the video, where Roberts wore Nike Air Max trainers, with neon moving sperm-shaped graffiti moving to the beat of the track. OK! magazine responded well whilst noting her unusually short dress in the video, they said [...] "we can't help but feel upbeat and summery when watching the star bounce about for single Lucky Day." [...] Aaron Spencer-Charles of Metro gave a mixed review, whilst describing the video, he ended with [...] "and that's it really. Nicola strolls along with a few colourful effects to keep things interesting. Maybe adding a male model would have made things a bit livelier." [...] Popjustice commented on Nicola's seemingly lack of confidence in the video, stating Nicola, you light up our world like nobody else. But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell, you don't know you're beautiful. Her short-dress in the video sparked criticism from some critics, to which Roberts responded saying [...] "I'm not safe with fashion, and I haven't been for a long time. I liked it, and everybody on the team liked it on the day. It was 120 degrees, so anything longer, I'd have died." ...|$|E

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Balans" [...] {{was directed by}} Anton San and released onto Stan's YouTube channel on 2 March 2016; by May 2016, the clip amassed over one million views. The clip was filmed in an abandoned warehouse or a polygon where the inside temperature was of 6°C. About the video, Stan particularly confessed that [...] " [...] is very dinamic and colored, {{the way that the}} life of a pop artist looks like." [...] The clip commences with Stan standing on a pickup, with fellow background dancers being present inside the car. Following their leaving, she <b>looks</b> <b>from</b> above at a partying crowd in a hall, which appears to be halfway filled with water, while sporting pink and red clothing. Subsequently, Stan is displayed dressing a pink fur coat and pants, while walking in the surroundings and finally discovering Mohombi.

2500|$|In a poll {{performed}} by NME, readers ranked {{it as the}} tenth best song of the year. Maura Johnston of The Village Voice, however, called the song and the accompanying music video overproduced, while New York magazine contributor Amanda Dobbis commented that [...] "it's hard to totally separate Del Rey's <b>looks</b> <b>from</b> the criticism that's been bubbling around her." [...] In responses to this controversy, Pastes Luke Larson said, [...] "when 'Video Games' first hit the web, people weren’t freaking out about Lana Del Rey or fake lips or Lizzy Grant.
