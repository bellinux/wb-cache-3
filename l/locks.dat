The rebuilding of <b>locks</b> 6 and 7, completed in 2000, brought the number of <b>locks</b> restored to five, and approximately one quarter of the canal has been restored to navigable standard.

5|$|There are a {{total of}} 105 <b>locks</b> on the Kennet and Avon Canal from Bristol to the River Thames, {{including}} 6 on the navigable section of the River Avon from Bristol to Bath and 9 on the navigable section of the River Kennet to its confluence with the Thames near Reading. The remaining 90 <b>locks</b> lie along the 57miles (92km) of canal. In Bath the canal separates from the river but follows its valley as far as Bradford on Avon. The ornate Bath <b>Locks</b> lead to a stretch through Limpley Stoke valley with few <b>locks.</b> The flight of <b>locks</b> at Devizes, including the Caen Hill <b>Locks,</b> raises the canal to its longest pound, which then ascends the 4 Wooton Rivers <b>locks</b> to the short summit pound which includes the Bruce Tunnel. Pumping stations are used to supply the canal with water. The canal continues through the rural landscape of Wiltshire and Berkshire before joining the River Kennet at Newbury and becoming a navigable river to Reading, where it flows into the River Thames.|$|E

5|$|Finally, the {{navigation}} {{was the subject}} of one of the last major attempts in the UK to attract commercial freight to the waterways. In 1983, it was upgraded to the 700-tonne Eurobarge standard by deepening the channels and enlarging the <b>locks</b> as far as Rotherham. Conisbrough lock was removed altogether, and the two Eastwood <b>locks</b> were combined into one. The new lock was initially named the Sir Frank Price Lock, after the chairman of the British Waterways Board who formally opened it on 1 June 1983. The expected rise in freight traffic did not occur, however. At Kilnhurst and Long Sandall, the new larger <b>locks</b> were built alongside the original <b>locks,</b> and so a comparison of the relative sizes can be made.|$|E
5|$|Five sets of sluices and two weirs {{are used}} to control the canal's depth. The sluices, located at Mode Wheel <b>Locks,</b> Barton <b>Locks,</b> Irlam <b>Locks,</b> Latchford <b>Locks</b> and Weaver Sluices, are {{designed}} to allow water entering the canal to flow along its length in a controlled manner. Each consists {{of a set of}} mechanically driven vertical steel roller gates, supported by masonry piers. Originally, manually operated Stoney Sluices were used; these were replaced in the 1950s by electrically driven units, with automation technology introduced from the late 1980s. The sluices are protected against damage from drifting vessels by large concrete barriers. Stop logs can be inserted by roving cranes, installed upstream of each sluice; at Weaver Sluices, accessed by boat, this task is performed by a floating crane.|$|E

5|$|The Panama Canal had {{a limited}} {{capacity}} determined by operational times and cycles {{of the existing}} <b>locks</b> and further constrained by the current trend towards larger (close to Panamax-sized) vessels transiting the canal which take more transit time within the <b>locks</b> and navigational channels, {{and the need for}} permanent periodical maintenance works due to the aging canal, which forces periodical shutdowns of this waterway. On the other hand, demand has been growing due to the rapid growth of international trade. Also, many users require a guarantee of certain level of service. Despite the gains which have been made in efficiency, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) estimates that the canal will reach its maximum sustainable capacity between 2009 and 2012. The long-term solution for the congestion problems was the expansion of the canal through a new third set of <b>locks.</b> Work started in 2007 and the expanded canal enter commercial operation in June 2016. The new <b>locks</b> allow transit of larger, Post-Panamax ships, which have a greater cargo capacity than the current <b>locks</b> are capable of handling.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Cache <b>locking</b> is an {{effective}} technique to improve timing predictability in real-time systems. In static cache <b>locking,</b> the <b>locked</b> memory blocks remain unchanged throughout the program execution. Thus static <b>locking</b> may not be effective for large programs where multiple memory blocks are competing for few cache lines available for <b>locking.</b> In comparison, dynamic cache <b>locking</b> overcomes cache space limitation through time-multiplexing of <b>locked</b> memory blocks. Prior dynamic <b>locking</b> technique partitions the program into regions and takes indepen-dent <b>locking</b> decisions for each region. We propose a flexible loop-based dynamic cache <b>locking</b> approach. We not only select the memory blocks to be <b>locked</b> but also the <b>locking</b> points (e. g., loop level). We judiciously allow memory blocks from the same loop to be <b>locked</b> at different program points for WCET improvement. We design a constraint-based approach that incorporates a global view {{to decide on the}} number of <b>locking</b> slots at each loop entry point and then select the memory blocks to be <b>locked</b> for each loop. Experimental evaluation shows that our dynamic cache <b>locking</b> approach achieves substantial improvement of WCET compared to prior techniques. I...|$|R
