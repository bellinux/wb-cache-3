5000|$|Historical {{literature}} often includes {{specific features}} of individuals or a gender {{that are considered}} desirable.

[...] In Persian literature, beautiful women are said to have breasts like pomegranates or lemons.

Boeldt's escaped, {{and it sounds like}} he's all the better for it." [...] While finding it not as good as Adventure's previous LP, a The 405 critic wrote that [...] "this {{can be seen as a}} transitional release or an experiment to test the waters of this project and for that I cannot fully say that this fails, because it doesn't." [...] The Line of Best Fit journalist Andrew Hwang wrote that [...] "Boeldt builds castles of tetris bricks, where each beat hits and clicks right into place. And each time the melody sinks, you feel yourself shrink a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>from</b> being so awestruck in the face."

It's the first song we've had where I don't play guitar or piano." [...] NME added, {{on the topic of}} the lack of guitar and piano, that [...] "the song is built around electric drum patterns and some slap bass from Chris Wolstenholme." [...] Speaking about his slap bass contribution, Wolstenholme joked that [...] "it's probably not ever been cool to play slap bass, ... but on that song it just seemed to work so we kept it in." [...] When played live, Bellamy plays a keytar. Music magazine Q describe the song as having a [...] "minimal and dance-y feel." [...] In the interview with Q, Bellamy also revealed the inspiration behind the song's lyrics, explaining that [...] "it's actually quite a personal song about me and my girlfriend. I'm thinking people have had enough of geo-political stuff {{by the end of the}} album."

5000|$|Despite {{the lineup}} changes, {{the album was}} still {{primarily}} written by founding members Jonas Renkse and Anders Nyström. The two wrote in isolation from one another, only sharing what they felt were their better ideas, and then presenting the ideas they both agreed upon {{to the rest of}} the band members if they felt it was good enough to build an entire song around. Renkse stated that no boundaries were put on ideas for arranging the album, leading them to be more adventurous in the creation process, actively trying to break away from the formula of their prior few albums. The band didn't desire to [...] "reinvent the wheel, but rather, [...] "break out a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>from</b> that old frame and do something a little bit different. The inclusion of the technically proficient guitar playing of Öjersson led to the inclusion of more guitar solos on the album, while Moilanen's style of drumming moved the album's sound further into progressive territory. The album had actually been completely recorded prior to Ojerson joining the band, but the band went back and added his guitar solo's over the finished work, wanting him to be able to [...] "leave his mark" [...] on the album. Conversely, Moilanen had joined earlier, and had a larger role in shaping the album's content, with Renkse and Nystrom frequently discussing ideas with him. Separately, the success of Dethroned and Uncrowned, the band's acoustic/ambient reworking of their prior album, Dead End Kings, lead the band to feel more comfortable with adding more diverse elements to the album as well.|$|E
