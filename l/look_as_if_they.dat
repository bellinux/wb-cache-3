When feeding, the birds hang with raised wings and patter on the surface with their feet, but, unlike the Wilson's storm petrel, do not <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are walking on the water. Birds will sometimes settle on the sea. Like other petrels, the European storm petrel cannot walk properly on land, but shuffles on its tarsi; once there is enough room, the bird flaps its wings to support itself on its toes.|$|E
25|$|To {{add more}} realism, {{the locker room}} scenes were improvised for Rourke and others to <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were {{actually}} socializing. Some of the deli scenes were improvised because Aronofsky was filming Rourke actually working there.|$|E
25|$|Artists such as Roland Penrose (author of the Home Guard Manual of Camouflage), Stanley William Hayter, Julian Trevelyan {{and many}} others were {{employed}} to conceal defences. In built-up areas pillboxes were disguised {{to look like a}} part of an adjacent building, carefully matched and provided with a roof to <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had always been there. In extreme cases, they were built inside existing buildings.|$|E

25|$|Chidambaram and Tung {{found that}} group size mattered immensely in a group’s performance. The smaller the group, {{the more likely}} each member was to participate, {{regardless}} of range (dispersed or collocated). The main difference stated between distributed and collocated groups was the social pressure at least to appear busy that is present in collocated groups. When others are present, people {{feel the need to}} <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are working hard, while those who are not in the presence of others do not.|$|E
25|$|Concretions {{are found}} {{in a variety of}} rocks, but are {{particularly}} common in shales, siltstones, and sandstones. They often outwardly resemble fossils or rocks that <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> do not belong to the stratum in which they were found. Occasionally, concretions contain a fossil, either as its nucleus or as a component that was incorporated during its growth but concretions are not fossils themselves. They appear in nodular patches, concentrated along bedding planes, protruding from weathered cliffsides, randomly distributed over mudhills or perched on soft pedestals.|$|E
25|$|Two black-figure vase {{painters}} {{are considered}} to be mannerists (540-520 BC). The painter Elbows Out decorated primarily Little Masters cups. The extended elbows of his figures are conspicuous, a characteristic responsible for his pragmatic name. He only seldom depicted mythological scenes; erotic scenes are much more common. He also decorated a rare vase form known as a lydion. The most important of the two painters was The Affecter, whose name comes from the exaggeratedly artificial impression made by his figures. These small-headed figures {{do not seem to be}} acting as much as posing. His early work shows scenes of daily life; later he turned to decorative scenes in which figures and attributes are recognizable, but hardly actions. If his figures are clothed they <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were padded; if they are naked they are very angular. The Affecter was both potter and painter; over 130 of his vases have survived.|$|E

500|$|The scenes filmed to <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> {{were at the}} Lorton Penitentiary {{cafeteria}} {{were actually}} filmed at a former hospital storage facility. In order to dress the set, the structure had to be completely cleared of debris and garbage; this required that several old pump housings be [...] "jackhammered into smithereens". The episode's title, [...] "Kitsunegari" [...] (狐狩り) is the Japanese term for [...] "fox hunting". The series hired two Japanese translators to yield a proper translation of the phrase, {{due to the fact}} that [...] "fox hunting" [...] is not readily rendered in Japanese.|$|E
500|$|For Khan and his followers, Fletcher {{created a}} strong {{contrast}} with the highly organized Starfleet uniforms; his idea was that the exiles' costumes were made out of whatever they could find. Fletcher said, [...] "My intention with Khan was to express {{the fact that they}} had been marooned on that planet with no technical infrastructure, so they had to cannibalize from the spaceship whatever they used or wore. Therefore, I tried to make it <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had dressed themselves out of pieces of upholstery and electrical equipment that composed the ship." [...] Khan's costume was designed with an open chest to show Ricardo Montalbán's physique. Fletcher also designed smocks for the Regula I scientists, and civilian clothes for Kirk and McCoy that were designed to look practical and comfortable.|$|E

The margin does not have , and is typically fringed with remnants of the veil. The gills on the underside of the cap are spaced closely together, and either free or narrowly attached to the stipe. They are white to cream color, and are interspersed with short lamellulae (gills that do not extend completely from cap margin to stipe). The gills may <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are waterlogged.|$|E

500|$|Frank Kameny soon {{realized}} the pivotal change {{brought by the}} Stonewall riots. An organizer of gay activism in the 1950s, {{he was used to}} persuasion, trying to convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different than they were. When he and other people marched in front of the White House, the State Department, and Independence Hall only five years earlier, their objective was to <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> could work for the U.S. government. Ten people marched with Kameny then, and they alerted no press to their intentions. Although he was stunned by the upheaval by participants in the Annual Reminder in 1969, he later observed, [...] "By the time of Stonewall, we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the country. A year later there was at least fifteen hundred. By two years later, to the extent that a count could be made, it was twenty-five hundred." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{not using}} the sets, the episode did re-use the Borg costumes from First Contact, which McNeill {{described}} as [...] "the scarier Borg" [...] compared to those seen previously in The Next Generation. This caused some problems with filming as an animatronic Borg arm used for the film was malfunctioning, leading to the production being stalled for several hours. For First Contact, the Borg had been re-designed by Michael Westmore and Deborah Everton. The former and his makeup team had worked on {{the look of the}} heads, which included a variety of different Borg appliances which could be mixed and matched to create an ongoing variety of looks. For example, Westmore's colleague Jake Garber had created ten different eye pieces. Everton, meanwhile, created the costumes for the Borg, and wanted them to be more elaborate than in previous appearances. This has been done with a view that individuals should <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had been transformed from the inside out, {{rather than the other way}} around.|$|E
500|$|One of Camouflage's {{first major}} deceptions was the dummy railway at Misheifa. Barkas {{assigned}} the artist Steven Sykes {{to build a}} convincing dummy to divert enemy attention from the real railhead at Capuzzo bringing materiel for Operation Crusader. This complex deception involved [...] of dummy railway, a dummy train, dummy sidings, and a selection of dummy tanks, all made of gerida palm hurdles and other simple materials, to <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had been delivered by the railway. More than 100 bombs were dropped on the Misheifa railhead, at least halving {{the attacks on the}} real thing at Capuzzo, giving the lie to the jokes about wooden bombs being dropped on wooden railways by an undeceived enemy. Barkas noted that [...] "camouflage men must be among the few otherwise sane beings who yearn to be bombed." [...] The pioneering effort's success was achieved in a few weeks, amidst severe shortages of men and raw materials. The writer Julian Trevelyan recorded that ...|$|E

500|$|The Thousand-Year Door has {{a unique}} visual style. The {{graphics}} consist of a mixture of 3D environments and 2D characters which <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are made of paper. At different points in the game, Mario is [...] "cursed" [...] with abilities that enable special moves in the overworld, {{all of which are}} based on the paper theme. Mario can fold into a boat or a paper airplane by standing on a special activation panel, and roll up into a scroll of paper or become paper-thin. The game's environments also follow this theme; for example, illusory objects that conceal secret items or switches can be blown away by a gust of wind due to the environment's paper-like qualities. In certain parts of the game, the player controls Bowser in multiple side-scrolling levels based on the original Super Mario Bros.. Additionally, the player controls Peach in the X-Naut Fortress at the completion of most game chapters.|$|E
500|$|Costume {{designer}} Robert Fletcher {{wanted to}} emphasize the effects of their harsh environment on Khan and his followers. [...] "My intention with Khan was to express {{the fact that they}} had been marooned on that planet with no technical infrastructure, so they had to cannibalize from the spaceship whatever they used or wore. Therefore, I tried to make it <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had dressed themselves out of pieces of upholstery and electrical equipment that composed the ship," [...] he said. Director Nicholas Meyer told Montalbán to keep Khan's right glove on at all times, in order to give viewers a puzzle they could form their own opinions about and add mystery to the character. Meyer has been repeatedly asked if Montalbán wore a prosthetic chest for his scenes, as his uniform was purposefully designed with an open front. Meyer replied in audio commentary for the film that Montalbán (who was 61 during filming) is [...] "one strong cookie," [...] and that no prosthetics were applied to the actor's sizeable frame.|$|E

2500|$|.....no {{video game}} {{has ever done}} a better job of {{capturing}} the style and rhythm of the movies. The action sequences in Uncharted 2 <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were shot by a team of cinematographers, then edited into a coherent and thrilling narrative. The game’s storyline is trite, but a first-rate cast of voice-over actors carry it off with flair.|$|E
2500|$|A small activist {{group called}} the Apostrophe Protection Society has campaigned for large {{retailers}} such as Harrods, Currys, and Selfridges to reinstate their missing punctuation. A spokesperson for Barclays PLC stated, [...] "It has just disappeared over the years. Barclays is no longer associated with the family name." [...] Further confusion {{can be caused by}} businesses whose names <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> should be pronounced differently without an apostrophe, such as Paulos Circus, and other companies that leave the apostrophe out of their logos but include it in written text, such as Cadwalader’s.|$|E
