5|$|A {{year after}} Gui's disappearance, {{there is a}} general {{consensus}} among commentators that the five booksellers were abducted by Chinese authorities. As of October 2016, Gui has spent a year in detention, while the other four men were released in early March 2016. One colleague, Lam Wing-kee, gave an interview that received significant media coverage in which he spoke in great detail about his abduction and his months in detention by mainland <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>in</b> Ningbo and subsequently Shaoguan.

5|$|Adopted {{from the}} Grand Theft Auto series, Red Dead Redemption has a {{modified}} wanted system. When the player commits a crime such as killing people near witnesses, some will {{run to the}} nearest police station. The player can bribe them or kill them {{before they reach the}} station. If a crime is committed near a police officer, the wanted meter immediately appears along with a bounty count which increases with each crime committed. If Marston's bounty becomes high enough he will be pursued by either the U.S. Marshals or by the Mexican Army depending on his locations. To evade <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>in</b> pursuit, John Marston must escape a circular zone until the wanted meter disappears. Alternatively, the player character can kill all lawmen in a town to have the wanted meter disappear. Despite the chase being aborted, a bounty is placed upon John which will cause bounty hunters to come after him in the wilderness. It is impossible to surrender to these bounty hunters by putting away Marston's weapon and standing still as they will kill him regardless. Only <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>in</b> towns and a posse will accept surrenders. The law will continue to chase Marston unless he pays his bounty at a telegraph station or presents a pardon letter. When arrested, Marston pays off his bounty and is then released. If the player does not have enough money to pay back the bounty, the law will assign bounty hunting activities.|$|E

Inexperience with law enforcement was rejected as well; the Court noted that previous opinions had rejected reliance on such factors.|$|E
5|$|Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{started his}} career as an {{offender}} profiler for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), where his unusual gift for empathising with the killers he was investigating aided in their capture. However, Black retires when he finds that his family—wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher) and daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady)—are being threatened by an unknown stalker, who is mailing polaroid photographs of the family to Black.

Horses can be {{an essential part of}} an overall team effort as they can move faster on the ground than a human on foot, can transport heavy equipment, and provide a more rested rescue worker when a subject is found.|$|E

5|$|As governor, Carroll {{increased}} funding {{for public education}} and promoted the use of coal {{as a means of}} alleviating the 1973 energy crisis. He also oversaw a major reorganization of the state's judicial system following voters' approval of a constitutional amendment in 1975. Many natural and man-made disasters occurred during his term in office, including the Great Blizzard of 1978 and the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire, leading to better safety practices and stricter <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>in</b> the state. When Carroll left office, both he and his predecessor were under the cloud of an investigation for an alleged insurance kickback scheme, but Carroll was not convicted of any wrongdoing.

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 18th century, <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>in</b> the {{counties}} of Croatia included county pandurs or hussars who patrolled roads and pursued criminals. In 1740, the term was applied to frontier guard duty infantry deployed in the Croatian Military Frontier (Banal Frontier), specifically its Karlovac and Varaždin Generalcies. The role of the pandurs as security guards was extended to Dalmatia after the establishment of Austrian rule there in the early 19th century. The term has dropped from official use for law enforcement officials, but it is still used colloquially in Croatia and the Western Balkans in a manner akin to the English word cop. The unit raised and led by Trenck is also referred to more specifically as Trenck's Pandurs, and less frequently in Croatia than elsewhere, as Croatian Pandurs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>in</b> the United States is {{primarily}} {{the responsibility of}} local police and sheriff's departments, with state police providing broader services. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) is {{the largest in the}} country. Federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have specialized duties, including protecting civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts' rulings and federal laws. At the federal level and in almost every state, a legal system operates on a common law. State courts conduct most criminal trials; federal courts handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. Plea bargaining in the United States is very common; the vast majority of criminal cases in the country are settled by plea bargain rather than jury trial.|$|E
5|$|Oba Chandler (October 11, 1946November 15, 2011) was an American man {{convicted and}} {{executed}} for the June 1989 triple murders of Joan Rogers {{and her two}} daughters, whose bodies were found, with their hands and feet bound, floating in Tampa Bay, Florida. Autopsies showed the victims had been thrown into the water while still alive, with ropes around their necks with a concrete block tied {{at the other end}} of the rope. The case became high-profile in 1992 when local police posted, on billboards, enlarged copies of the suspect's handwriting recovered on a pamphlet in the victims' car. Chandler was identified as the killer when his neighbor recognized the handwriting. This was the first such use of billboards by <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>in</b> the U.S.; billboards became useful tools in searches for missing people.|$|E

The ACLU also played a key role in initiating a nationwide effort to reduce misconduct (such as extracting false confessions) within police departments, by publishing the report Lawlessness in <b>Law</b> <b>Enforcement</b> <b>in</b> 1931, under the auspices of Herbert Hoover's Wickersham Commission. In 1934, the ACLU lobbied for the passage of the Indian Reorganization Act, which restored some autonomy to Native American tribes, and established penalties for kidnapping Native American children.|$|E

5|$|The meat, oil, bones, {{and skin}} of {{manatees}} are valuable items. In some countries, such as Nigeria and Cameroon, African manatees are sold to zoos, aquariums, and online as pets, sometimes being shipped internationally. Though illegal, lack of <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>in</b> these areas induce poaching. Some residents of West African countries, such as Mali and Chad, {{depend on the}} oil of the African manatee to cure ailments such as ear infections, rheumatism, and skin conditions. Hunting is the largest source of mortality in Amazonian manatees, {{and there are no}} management plans except for in Colombia. Amazonian manatees, especially calves, are sometimes illegally sold as pets, but there are several institutions that care for and rescue these orphans, with the possibility of their releasing into the wild.
