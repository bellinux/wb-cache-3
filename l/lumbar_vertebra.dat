The bullet ricocheted off Hamilton's second or third false rib, fracturing it and causing considerable damage to his internal organs, particularly his liver and diaphragm, before becoming lodged in his first or second <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebra.</b> Biographer Ron Chernow considered the circumstances to indicate that, after taking deliberate aim, Burr fired second, while biographer James Earnest Cooke suggested that Burr took careful aim and shot first, and Hamilton fired while falling, after being struck by Burr's bullet.|$|E

In the main series, Bianchi took two pole positions and a number of points positions before he was injured in a first-lap crash at the Hungaroring. In the feature race, he spun into the path of the field exiting the first corner, and was struck head-on by Ho-Pin Tung, sustaining a fractured second <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebra</b> in the process.

5|$|Pseudoryzomys has 19 or 20thoracic (chest) and lumbar vertebrae, 13 {{of which}} bear ribs, as is {{characteristic}} of oryzomyines. The first ribs contact both the seventh cervical (neck) vertebra and the first thoracic vertebra, an important character of the Sigmodontinae. Unlike in most sigmodontines, including Holochilus and Lundomys, the fourth <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebra</b> lacks the processes known as anapophyses. There are three or four sacral and about 29caudal (tail) vertebrae. Between {{the second and third}} caudal vertebrae, separate bones called hemal arches are present. These display a spinous process at the back, as in both Holochilus and Lundomys. On the humerus, the upper arm bone, the entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; in some other cricetids, it perforates the far (distal) end of the humerus.|$|E

25|$|The {{mesentery}} of {{the small}} intestine arises from {{the root of the}} mesentery (or mesenteric root) and is the part connected with the structures in front of the vertebral column.

25|$|Research on the Lady's spine {{located a}} smooth lateral curve on the lumbar region (lower spine), with a {{convexity}} towards the left. This {{is an indication}} of lumbar scoliosis. The limits of the curve have been determined. The upper limit is between the twelfth thoracic vertebra and the first <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebra.</b> The lower limit is between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae. The center of the curve is between the second and third lumbar vertebrae. The scoliosis of the Lady is mild, with a Cobb angle of less than 20°. Researchers found no evidence of structural abnormalities in the vertebrae, no fractures, and no congenital anomalies (birth defects). The researchers suspect that the Lady may not have actually suffered from scoliosis while still alive. The curved spine of the mummy may be a postmortem condition, resulting from the position of the body during the mummification process.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Moyne regained consciousness, {{and in a}} few minutes, {{a doctor}} and {{ambulance}} arrived. Moyne was rushed to a British military hospital in Cairo, and admitted at 1:40p.m., in critical condition, having lost a great deal of blood through gross hemorrhaging and suffering from shock. Five minutes later, he was given the first of three blood transfusions, causing his condition to improve. After he complained of a burning sensation down his right leg and an inability to move it, X-rays revealed an injury to his thoracic vertebrae. Later, his right arm also became paralyzed {{as a result of the}} neck wound. Doctors were reluctant to operate until his condition improved, but at 5:30, a lumbar puncture revealed a blood stain, and it was decided to operate. He was given another blood transfusion, and in the operation that followed, surgeons removed the bullet lodged near the second <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebra</b> and discovered the injuries to the colon and large intestine, while the neck wound and finger wounds were cleaned. Soon after the operation, his condition began to deteriorate, and he died at 8:40 pm, aged 64.|$|E

500|$|While {{the skull}} of Mesopropithecus most closely resembles that of modern sifakas, the postcranial {{skeleton}} is quite different. [...] Rather than having elongated hindlimbs for leaping, Mesopropithecus had elongated forelimbs, suggesting they predominantly used quadrupedal locomotion, slow climbing, with some forelimb and hindlimb suspension. [...] In fact, {{they were the most}} quadrupedal of the sloth lemurs, having an intermembral index between 97 and 113, compared to the lower value for indriids and higher values for the other sloth lemurs. [...] (In arboreal primates, an intermembral index of 100 predicts quadrupedalism, higher values predict suspensory behavior, and lower values predict leaping behavior.) [...] Wrist bones found in 1999 further demonstrate that Mesopropithecus was a vertical climber and the most loris-like of the sloth lemurs. [...] Analysis of a <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebra</b> of M.dolichobrachion further supported this conclusion.|$|E

500|$|M.dolichobrachion was {{discovered}} in 1986 and formally described in 1995. [...] It {{was found in the}} caves of Ankarana, northern Madagascar, around {{the same time that the}} first remains of Babakotia were unearthed. [...] The species name dolichobrachion is Greek, coming from dolicho- ("long") and brachion ("arm"), and means [...] "long-armed". It was a medium-sized lemur, slightly larger than the other two members of its genus, weighing approximately [...] [...] It differed significantly from the other two in its limb proportions and its postcranial morphology. [...] Most notably, it was the only species in the genus to have forelimbs that were longer than the hindlimbs, due to a substantially longer and more robust humerus (yielding an intermembral index of 113), as well as more curved phalanges (finger and toe bones). [...] For these reasons, it is thought to have been more sloth-like in its use of suspension. [...] This was further supported by a study of a single <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebra.</b> [...] This vertebra was similar to that of Babakotia in having a moderately reduced, dorsally oriented spinous process and a transverse processes (plates of bone that protrude from the vertebrae) that points to the side (laterally). [...] The vertebra was intermediate in length when compared with other sloth lemurs, and its laminae (two plates of bone that connect to the spinous process) were not as broad as seen in Palaeopropithecus. In M.dolichobrachion, skull length averaged , ranging from [...] [...] The only notable difference from the two other species in its teeth was that the third upper molar had a relatively wider trigon and smaller talon (groups of cusps on the molar teeth). It was a mixed feeder, eating leaves, fruits, and seeds. [...] This species was more of a seed predator than the other two species, but was not as specialized as closely related Babakotia radofilai. [...] M.dolichobrachion was rare and shared its range with two other sloth lemurs, Babakotia radofilai and Palaeopropithecus maximus. [...] It was the most distinct member of its genus and was geographically restricted to the extreme north of the island.|$|E

40|$|Automatic and {{accurate}} <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebrae</b> detection {{is an essential}} step of image-guided minimally invasive spine surgery (IG-MISS).

Training data is augmented by DRR and automatic segmentation of ROI is able to reduce the computational complexity. Furthermore, a feature fusion deep learning (FFDL) model is introduced to combine two types of features of <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebrae</b> X-ray images, which uses sobel kernel and Gabor kernel to obtain the contour and texture of <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> respectively.

2500|$|The lumbosacral joint, {{between the}} sacrum {{and the last}} <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebra,</b> has, like all vertebal joints, an {{intervertebral}} disc, anterior and posterior ligaments, ligamenta flava, interspinous and supraspinous ligaments, and synovial joints between the articular processes of the two bones.

[...] The iliolumbar ligament passes between {{the tip of the}} transverse process of the fifth <b>lumbar</b> <b>vertebra</b> and the posterior part of the iliac crest. [...] The lateral lumbosacral ligament, partly continuous with the iliolumbar ligament, passes down from the lower border of the transverse process of the fifth vertebra to the ala of the sacrum.
