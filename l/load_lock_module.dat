40|$|Abstract. To avoid data races, {{concurrent}} operations should {{either be}} at distinct times or on distinct data. Atomicity is the abstraction that an operation takes effect at a single, discrete instant in time, with lin-earisability being a well-known correctness condition which asserts that concurrent operations appear to behave atomically. Disjointness is the abstraction that operations act on distinct data resource, with concur-rent separation logics enabling reasoning about threads {{that appear to}} operate independently on disjoint resources. Building on separation logic with concurrent abstract predicates (CAP), we introduce TaDA, a program logic which combines the benefits of ab-stract atomicity and abstract disjointness. We give several examples: an atomic <b>lock</b> <b>module,</b> a CAP example with a twist, which cannot be done using linearisability; an atomic MCAS module implemented using our <b>lock</b> <b>module,</b> a classic linearisability example which cannot be done us-ing CAP; and a double-ended queue module implemented using MCAS. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new model for Cluster-tools with two <b>load</b> <b>locks.</b> Cluster-tools are widely used to {{automate}} single wafer processing in semiconductor industry. The <b>load</b> <b>locks</b> are the entry points into the vacuum of the Cluster-tool's mainframe. Usually there are two of them available. Each lot being processed, is dedicated to a single load-lock. Therefore at most two different lots (with possibly different processing times and qualification) can be processed simultaneously. This restriction {{is one of the}} major potential bottlenecks. Capacity planning is one of the possible applications for the proposed model and the paper demonstrates the integration into a more general framework that considers different tool types and different operational modes. The paper also generalizes an earlier model that is limited to three processing chambers. The proposed modeling approach is based on makespan reductions by parallel processing. It turns out that the performance of the new approach is similar, when compared to the generalized model for three chambers, but the new approach outperforms the generalized model for four and more chambers...|$|R

40|$|Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) is a {{promising}} technique for growing ultrathin, pristine dielectrics on metal substrates, which {{is essential to}} many electronic devices. Tunnel junctions are an excellent example which require a leak-free, ultrathin dielectric tunnel barrier of typical thickness around 1 nm between two metal electrodes. A challenge {{in the development of}} ultrathin dielectric tunnel barrier using ALD is controlling the nucleation of dielectrics on metals with minimal formation of native oxides at the metal surface for high-quality interfaces between the tunnel barrier and metal electrodes. This poses a critical need for integrating ALD with ultra-high vacuum (UHV) physical vapor deposition. In order to address these challenges, a viscous-flow ALD chamber was designed and interfaced to an UHV magnetron sputtering chamber via a <b>load</b> <b>lock.</b> A sample transportation system was implemented for in situ sample transfer between the ALD, <b>load</b> <b>lock,</b> and sputtering chambers.

Epitaxial surface growth of oligophenylenes on a heated muscovite mica crystal results in a thin film of mutually aligned nanofibres with dimensions of tens of nanometres in height, hundreds of nanometres in width and tens to hundreds of micrometres in length. By applying a shadow mask, a film pattern is generated which contains only sparse, randomly grown nanofibres, which in turn represent a unique ‘fingerprint’ of the growth area.
