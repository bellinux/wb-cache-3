40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} are to find out whether: (1) podcast {{is more effective than}} movie to teach listening comprehension; (2) students having high <b>listening</b> <b>habit</b> have better <b>listening</b> comprehension than those having low listening habit; (3) there is any interaction effect between teaching media and different <b>listening</b> <b>habit</b> on the students’ listening comprehension. For the purpose of the topic, three groups of students consisting of eighty four were cluster randomly selected and were divided into two groups of twenty eight as the experimental and control class. Research method was quasi-experimental. The instruments were multiple choice test and questionnaire. Both groups were taught in the same style. Before the instruments were used, a tryout had been administered to know the validity and reliability of the instruments. Furthermore, it was found out that the data were in normal distribution and homogeneous based on the normality testing and homogeneity testing. The researcher analyzed the listening test scores of students who had high and low <b>listening</b> <b>habit</b> in both groups. Multifactor Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test were applied with the level of significance α = 0. 05. The results of the test and the related comparisons, findings showed that: (1) podcast is more effective than movie to teach listening comprehension; (2) students having high <b>listening</b> <b>habit</b> have better <b>listening</b> comprehension than those having low listening habit; (2) there is interaction effect between teaching media and different <b>listening</b> <b>habit</b> on the students’ listening comprehension. To sum up, podcast is an effective media to teach listening to the eighth grade students of SMP Muhammadiyah 1 Way Jepara, in the academic year 2014 / 2015. However, in the implementation of the media, a teacher must consider about the students’ level of <b>listening</b> <b>habit.</b> As proved in the research, <b>listening</b> <b>habit</b> influences the students’ listening comprehension. By considering the students’ level of <b>listening</b> <b>habit,</b> a teacher can choose the media he/she uses properly to teach listening in order to improve students’ listening comprehension.

40|$|In {{the first}} half of the sixth century, an Italian monk, Benedict of Nursia, {{provided}} a framework for Christian monastic life. In the last half of the nineteenth century, his descendants arrived in the Great Plains, part of the westward movement of Christian missionaries in North America. What could this ancient way of life offer to a new land of Native tribes and immigrant farmers, traders, and soldiers? And what might this new land contribute to the shaping of a uniquely American form of monastic life? These Benedictine men and women brought with them centuries of experience as learners and teachers, and they shared their educative way of life, as well as their schools, with Native peoples and European immigrants alike. 1 In turn, the land and peoples of the Great Plains have contributed to the evolution of Benedictine monastic life in North America to this day. In the first part of this article I sketch three major characteristics of Benedictine education: an attitude of <b>listening,</b> a <b>habit</b> of discretion, and a holistic methodology. In the second section I explore the interaction of Benedictine education and its new prairie milieu.

Interest in politics was accounted for by political/social factors and by media use, especially higher news engagement and lower media trust. However, taking action on an issue of concern was accounted for only by political/social factors, with the exception that slightly fewer actions were taken by those who watched more television. These findings provided little support for the media malaise thesis, and instead were interpreted as providing qualified support for the cognitive/motivational theory of news as a means of engaging the public...|$|R

40|$|Polish is a rhotic language. Therefore, in {{the process}} of {{learning}} General British (Cruttenden 2014) pronunciation, Polish students find it difficult not to produce non-prevocalic /r/s. The following study aims at assessing to what extent musical hearing is helpful in acquiring non-rhoticity among Polish advanced students of English. So far, {{it has been shown that}} music has an effect on language in many domains, such as neurolinguistics (Zatorre et al. 2002, Patel et al. 2008), L 1 acquisition (Wermke and Mende 2009, Brandt et al. 2012) and L 2 acquisition (Lee and Hung 2008). Moreover, the findings in Pastuszek-Lipińska (2008) point to musical hearing as a predisposition for effective speech imitation. Based on these assumptions, we hypothesize that musical hearing has an effect on how fast students of English adapt to non-rhotic pronunciation. Our subjects are 36 Polish speakers (18 female, 18 male) studying English as their major at 1 BA level. They took part in two recording sessions, i. e. before and after a two-semester intensive accent training course they have to complete as part of their curriculum, where they are taught the General British pronunciation model. The stimulus comprised of 1) a reading passage, 2) a set of dialogues eliciting rhoticity/non-rhoticity and 3) a wordlist eliciting START and NORTH vowels before non-prevocalic /r/. Next, the participants took part in a musical hearing test, measuring pitch perception, musical memory and rhythm perception. Finally, the speakers were also asked to complete an online survey regarding their <b>listening</b> to music <b>habits</b> and musical experiences (i. e. playing musical instruments, singing, attending music lessons, etc.). The preliminary analysis shows that across all speakers over 60 % of all variants were pronounced as rhotic in the first recording session. With time, all our participants improved and produced fewer rhotic variants. It seems that students with better musical hearing had better results for non-rhoticity in both recording sessions. The results suggest that learners with a better musical ear are able to acquire non-rhoticity at an earlier stage...|$|R
6000|$|She had {{no sooner}} left him than Olive Chancellor came towards him with eyes {{that seemed to}} say, [...] "I don't care whether you are here now or not--I'm all right!" [...] But what her lips said was much more gracious; she asked him if she mightn't have the {{pleasure}} of introducing him to Mrs. Farrinder. Ransom consented, with a little of his Southern flourish, {{and in a moment}} the lady got up to receive him from the midst of the circle that now surrounded her. It was an occasion for her to justify her reputation of an elegant manner, and it must be impartially related that she struck Ransom as having a dignity in conversation and a command of the noble style which could not have been surpassed by a daughter--one of the most accomplished, most far-descended daughters--of his own latitude. It was as if she had known that he was not eager for the changes she advocated, and wished to show him that, especially to a Southerner who had bitten the dust, her sex could be magnanimous. This knowledge of his secret heresy seemed to him to be also in the faces of the other ladies, whose circumspect glances, however (for he had not been introduced), treated it as a pity rather than as a shame. He was conscious of all these middle-aged feminine eyes, conscious of curls, rather limp, that depended from dusky bonnets, of heads poked forward, as if with a waiting, <b>listening,</b> familiar <b>habit,</b> of no one being very bright or gay--no one, at least, but that girl he had noticed before, who had a brilliant head, and who now hovered {{on the edge of the}} conclave. He met her eye again; she was watching him too. It had been in his thought that Mrs. Farrinder, to whom his cousin might have betrayed or misrepresented him, would perhaps defy him to combat, and he wondered whether he could pull himself together (he was extremely embarrassed) sufficiently to do honour to such a challenge. If she would fling down the glove on the temperance question, it seemed to him that it would be in him to pick it up; for the idea of a meddling legislation on this subject filled him with rage; the taste of liquor being good to him, and his conviction strong that civilisation itself would be in danger if it should fall into the power of a herd of vociferating women (I am but the reporter of his angry formulae) to prevent a gentleman from taking his glass. Mrs. Farrinder proved to him that she had not the eagerness of insecurity; she asked him if he wouldn't like to give the company some account of the social and political condition of the South. He begged to be excused, expressing at the same time a high sense of the honour done him by such a request, while he smiled to himself at the idea of his extemporising a lecture. He smiled even while he suspected the meaning of the look Miss Chancellor gave him: [...] "Well, you are not of much account after all!" [...] To talk to those people about the South--if they could have guessed how little he cared to do it! He had a passionate tenderness for his own country, and a sense of intimate connexion with it which would have made it as impossible for him to take a roomful of Northern fanatics into his confidence as to read aloud his mother's or his mistress's letters. To be quiet about the Southern land, not to touch her with vulgar hands, to leave her alone with her wounds and her memories, not prating in the market-place either of her troubles or her hopes, but waiting as a man should wait, for the slow process, the sensible beneficence, of time--this was the desire of Ransom's heart, and he was aware of how little it could minister to the entertainment of Miss Birdseye's guests.|$|R

In the {{aftermath}} of the exhibition I started to ponder how our artwork relates to the context of sound art and my personal uncertainty about the whole field of sound art in general. I started reading literature about sound art and the ideas that I was exposed to and the beginning of a collaboration through internship with sound artist Ariel Busta-mante, made me ask the question from myself — “What is sound art and what kind of sound art KIVIKASA is?” My master thesis walks through this aforementioned chain of events utilizing the method of practice based research in which the subject of inquiry is the artwork, its creator and the whole process. I will reflect my personal background motivations and attitudes, review events and ideas that have influenced the creative process. Through these intentions and believes I will review and reflect the creative process — both design and construction process by revealing what lies beneath KIVIKASA until the moment when the first question was asked that ignited this writing process. Then I will be transported into the world of sound art literature to explore what sound art is, or what it could be. This is done by reviewing history of sound art and some of the ideas that are expressed in the literature, for example <b>listening</b> and the <b>habit</b> of sound art sticking with its own materiality of sound. In the end I will be brought back to analyse and inspect the artwork in the light of new acquired understanding from the literature. I am trying to find understanding to the question: “What kind of sound art KIVIKASA is?” In the conclusion I try to search understanding about how the writing process, literature and the whole process affected me.
