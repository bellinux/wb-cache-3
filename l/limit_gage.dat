40|$|Abstract: This {{memorandum}} discusses a {{new design}} definition technique, requiring no standard, which pictorially shows part and <b>gage</b> <b>limits</b> {{on the same}} drawing. When functional gages, test fixtures, or optical chart gages are the selected inspection method, design, manufacturing process, and gage engineers can use these drawings directly to replace the usual standards-based drawings. In essence, this advanced technology visually describes true position dimensioning and tolerancing. It enables product designers to directly control the acceptance process...|$|R
40|$|A {{reusable}} miniature strain transducer {{for use in}} {{the measurement}} of static or quasi-static, high level, biaxial strain on the surface of test specimens or structures was studied. Two cantilever arms, constructed by machining the material to appropriate flexibility, are self-aligning and constitute the transducing elements of the device. Used in conjunction with strain gages, the device enables testing beyond normal <b>gage</b> <b>limits</b> for high strains and number of load cycles. The device does not require conversion computations since the electrical output of the strain gages is directly proportional to the strain measured...|$|R
50|$|A Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles (DCHP) is {{available}} in a 1967 edition (Avis et al. 1967) and in a 2017 expanded, updated and partially revised edition (Dollinger and Fee 2017). DCHP is a historical usage dictionary of words, expressions, or meanings which are native to Canada or which are distinctively characteristic of Canadian usage though not necessarily exclusive to Canada. The first edition was edited by Walter S. Avis (ed.-in-chief), C. Crate, P. Drysdale, D. Leechman, M. H. Scargill, C. J. Lovell, and published in 1967 by W. J. <b>Gage</b> <b>Limited.</b>|$|R

40|$|Measuring errors {{caused by}} {{deformation}} (flattening) of a measured object appear {{under the influence}} of pressure force and weight of the measured object. Plastic strain, arising at the contact of a measured object and an undeformable contact tip of a measuring device, can be calculated by applying the Hertz plastic solution and the hypothesis of plastic strain. In a small area of contact between two bodies pressing against one another with force F, there appears the so-called contact stress. It can sometime reach very high values, exceeding the yield point, even when the contact pressure is relatively small. In the present work, the authors describe a theoretical {{solution to the problem of}} plastic strain between two bodies. The derived relationships enable to calculate force F during measurements of a deformable object by means of an instrument with an undeformable, spherical measuring tip. By applying the τmax hypothesis, a solution was obtained for the force F in an inexplicit form. The theoretical solution was verified with the digital simulation and experimental measurement. With the FEM method, the <b>limit</b> length <b>gage</b> was modeled in interaction with the measured shaft of a diameter d larger than the nominal one of Δl value...|$|R
40|$|Methods and {{apparatus}} {{are provided}} for a torque driver including a displaceable gear to limit torque {{transfer to a}} fastener at a precisely controlled torque limit. A biasing assembly biases a first gear into engagement with a second gear for torque transfer {{between the first and}} second gear. The biasing assembly includes a pressurized cylinder controlled at a constant pressure that corresponds to a torque <b>limit.</b> A calibrated <b>gage</b> and valve is used to set the desired torque limit. One or more coiled output linkages connect the first gear with the fastener adaptor which may be a socket for a nut. A gear tooth profile provides a separation force that overcomes the bias to limit torque at the desired torque limit. Multiple fasteners may be rotated simultaneously to a desired torque limit if additional output spur gears are provided. The torque limit is adjustable and may be different for fasteners within the same fastener configuration...|$|R
30|$|Currently, several {{millions}} commercially prepared box lunches per day {{are consumed}} in Japan [1]. Therefore, automation {{of the production}} of the box lunches is required. To produce box lunches, the handling of food using a robot hand must be realized [2, 3]. Hence, a printable soft gripper was developed for food handling which can grasp foods that are soft and easily deformed [4]. It is possible to use a 3 D printer to easily produce the soft gripper. For handling of food materials, the estimation of grasping state is necessary. However, the sensing ability of the printable soft gripper to sensing is not discussed sufficiently in previous research [5, 6]. Bending of the printable soft gripper was successfully measured using a strain gage [7]. However, when using strain gages for measuring the bending of the printable soft gripper, the finger size of the gripper is <b>limited</b> by strain <b>gage’s</b> size and the production cost of gripper increases. There are some previous research about pressure sensing, deformation sensing and load sensing for the soft gripper or soft robotics. However, there is no discussion about sensor cost, size and estimation of grasping state [8 – 10].|$|R
40|$|Combined stress theory {{coupled with}} {{laboratory}} practice has improved student comprehension in both a sophomore-level {{mechanics of materials}} and an upper-level experimental mechanics course. The Combined Stress lecture has traditionally developed the theory from free body diagram through beam deflection, with related homework problems providing analytical practice. Similarly, the Combined Stress laboratory has traditionally provided students an opportunity to experimentally and analytically verify and validate the combined stress theory. Good correlation between theoretical and experimental results was frequently obtained through the utilization of a carefully machined C-Clamp with strain gage instrumentation. However, the twist method of introducing axial and bending loads to the inside and outside surfaces of the beam portion of the C-Clamp instrumented strain <b>gages</b> <b>limited</b> both the accuracy {{and the amount of}} data that could be collected within a standard 110 -minute laboratory session. Recent Combined Stress laboratory upgrades have included introducing a load cell transducer, 3 D modeling, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and utilizing data acquisition (DAQ) hardware and software. The voltage output of the load cell can be directly correlated to the clamping force and provides a useful, new experimental baseline result. The FEA analysis outputs, at various loa...|$|R

[...] He later had short spells with Football League clubs Fulham and Brighton & Hove Albion but failed {{to make it out}} of the reserve team. [...] In July 1949 he rejoined Gillingham and made 16 Southern League appearances deputising for regular goalkeeper Johnny Burke in the 1949-50 season, {{at the end of which}} the Gills were elected into The Football League. [...] Day, however, broke his arm in a reserve team match at the end of the season and this, combined with the signing of new goalkeeper Larry <b>Gage,</b> <b>limited</b> his first team chances during the 1950-51 season. [...] He made his Football League debut against Aldershot in April 1951, but it was to be his only league appearance.|$|R
