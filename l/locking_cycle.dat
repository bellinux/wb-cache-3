50|$|No {{external}} power is needed: the lift lock functions by gravity alone using the counterweight principle. One caisson always ascends {{and the other}} always descends during each <b>locking</b> <b>cycle.</b> When one caisson reaches the top position, it stops 12 in below the water level of the upper reach, and the control valve is closed; Siemens ultrasonic sensors are used to help determine the differential. The upper reach and top caisson gates open, and water flows into the top caisson until the level equalizes. The weight of the extra foot of water is 144 ST, making the total weight of the upper caisson 1844 ST. Any vessels that just ascended in the top caisson exit into the upper reach, and any new vessels making a transit of the lock then enter the bottom or top caisson from the lower or upper reach respectively. Once the vessels are secured, all gates are closed and the crossover valve in the connecting pipe between the ram shafts is opened. Since the upper caisson weighs more than the lower caisson (1,844 vs 1,700 tons), it pushes down on its ram, forcing out water from its shaft via the connecting pipe into the shaft of the bottom caisson. The force pushes up on the bottom caisson's ram, raising the caisson {{up to the top}} position. When the gate of the newly descended top caisson and lower reach gates open at the bottom, the extra foot of water flows out and equalizes with the water level in the lower reach of the canal, and any descended vessels exit, allowing the cycle to start over again.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Phase-locked loops (PLLs) {{are widely}} used in {{electronic}} systems. As PLL malfunction {{is one of the}} most important factors in re-fabs of SoCs, fast simulation of PLLs to capture non-ideal behavior accurately is an immediate, pressing need in the semiconductor design industry. In this paper, we present a nonlinear macromodel based PLL simulation technique that is considerably more accurate than prior linear PLL simulation techniques. Our method is able to accurately capture transient behavior and faithfully estimate timing jitter in noisy PLLs. We demonstrate the proposed technique on ring and LC voltagecontrolled oscillator (VCO) based PLLs, and compare results against linear PLL macromodels and full SPICE-level simulation. We show that, unlike prior linear macromodel based approaches, the proposed nonlinear technique captures the dynamics of complex phenomena such as <b>locking,</b> <b>cycle</b> slipping and power supply noise induced PLL jitter, replicating qualitative features from full SPICE simulations accurately while providing speedups of over two orders of magnitude.

The main idea of the plan is to build a ring dike around HCMC in combination with several movable tidal barriers. One of these barriers is the Muong Chuoi Barrier. In this report a conceptual design of the Muong Chuoi Barrier is made. The structure consists of a movable tidal barrier and a navigation lock, both able to bear the water in both directions. The navigation lock provides a possibility of vessels passing when the barrier is closed. In the preliminary research information is gained about the location properties, the soil conditions, the hydraulic conditions and the shipping class, which results in a basis of design. An analysis of diffrent gate and foundation types give a number of possible alternatives. Vietnamese unit prices are investigated and used to make a proper cost estimation of the different alternatives. The most important requirements from the basis of design are: the normative high water level, the water discharge of the Muong Chuoi river, the shipping class, the number of vessels passing every day and minimum life span of the structure. After a selection between all the possible solutions, that follow from the preliminary research, four alternatives are worked out, which are a combination between two gate types, a lifting gate and a radial gate, and two foundation types, a caisson foundation and foundation with combi wall and underwater concrete. By means of structural calculations, the quantities of the materials used are determined. Based on these results and the unit prices from the preliminary research, a cost estimation of every alternative is made. In the multi criteria analysis for the barrier, the most important factor are the costs, its weighing factor is 50 %. Other criteria are: maintenance, constructability, usability and environmental impact. After the multi criteria analysis, the best alternative is alternative D, the radial gate in combination the combi wall foundation. The study of alternatives for the navigation lock focuses only on the lock head. Again a selection is made between the possible solutions that follow from the preliminary research. Four types are selected for the multi criteria analysis: mitre gates, single leaf gates, lifting gates and rolling or sliding gates. One of the most important criteria for the navigation lock are cost (35 %). Also the usability (35 %) is considered to be important, in particular the <b>locking</b> <b>cycle</b> and reliability. After the multi criteria analysis, the best alternative is the single leave gate. A conceptual design for the lock is created.

Novel comminution methods, which offer the prospect of achieving the required outcomes of size reduction and mineral liberation at lower energy consumption, are continually being sought. In the past five years, extensive research using high voltage pulse electrical comminution technology {{has been carried out}} at the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre (JKMRC), in collaboration with seiFrag AG. The major outcome of this research is the development of the concept of pre-weakening ore particles by electrical comminution procedures to reduce the energy consumption in the downstream grinding circuit.

The S- 3 ore typically contains 0. 3 % copper and from 3. 0 to 5. 5 g/t gold. The study involved both laboratory and plant testing. Four routes were investigated to treat the S- 3 ore: flotation with the present circuit and reagents, flotation with the present circuit and new reagents, flotation at natural pH in a slightly modified circuit, and direct cyanidation.

40|$|Introduction In {{navigation}} locks levelling is executed under free flow. The net {{flow from}} the upper section into the lower section of the waterway is considered as a water loss. An innovative water saving concept is an IRS Lock. IRS stands for inflatable rubber structure. The concept consists of an air filled IRS applied in a lock chamber. In this way part of the water loss is substituted by an ‘air loss’. It was not clear {{whether or not the}} IRS Lock concept is a feasible water saving solution. IRSs are formed by a rubber sheet connected to a foundation. The sheet is so flexible that it is considered to have no bending stiffness. The shape of the IRS results from the loads acting on the sheet. During the use of an IRS, four phases are distinguished; the inflation, the inflated, the deflation and the deflated phase. In each phase, the internal pressure is different and thus a different shape results. In case of the IRS Lock, the IRS is completely submerged and the hydrostatic load is the main load. Also loads occur by flows from lock operations and vessel movements. The different phases of use, shapes and the new application area make the design of the IRS Lock a complex process. Design A first design of the IRS Lock has been developed. The Eastern Lock, located in the Terneuzen Lock complex, was used as an environment for the design. In the design the sheet of the IRS is connected to the lock chamber walls. In navigation locks a minimum keel clearance is required between the vessel and the lock chamber bottom. The IRS is located above the bottom of the lock chamber. The water level in the lock chamber, and therefore also the available depth and keel clearance, varies by the tide. The first design of the IRS is optimized {{in such a way that}} the design results in a large water saving while maintaining the minimum required keel clearance. The designed IRS has a crest height of 2, 5 meter and still allows the draught of the design vessel. In total three IRSs are applied in the length of the Eastern Lock. Additionally, several elements of the IRS Lock have been elaborated. Among others the strength of the rubber sheet has been verified. Functional performance The functional performance of the first design of the IRS Lock has been assessed. Per <b>Lock</b> <b>cycle</b> the designed IRSs will save 9056 m 3 of water. Because of the tidal fluctuations in the water levels, and the limitations in available depth and keel clearance, the IRS can only be used for 6 of the 18 <b>lock</b> <b>cycles</b> per tidal period. The total amount of water that is saved per tidal period is on average 25 % of the total water loss. As part of a RAMS-analysis, a Failure Mode Effect Analysis has been performed. Measures have been taken to keep the risk of failure at an acceptable level. From the functional performance it follows that the designed IRS Lock is technically feasible. An alternative for the IRS Lock is a pumping station that pumps the lost water back into the upper section of the waterway. It has been found that in all possible situations the IRS Lock will use more energy per unit of saved volume than a pumping station. Also the Life Cycle Costs are higher. This makes the IRS Lock economically less attractive. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{fish lock}} at the dam of the {{reservoir}} Höllensteinsee (river Schwarzer Regen, Germany) {{was built in}} 2013. The dam has a level difference of 13 m and is used for energy production. The fish lock was constructed in an old bottom outlet channel. The necessary dotation of 500 liters per second is energetically used by a micro turbine. In the year 2014 a monitoring was realized to proof {{the function of the}} fish lock for upstream fish migration. Because of the water depth {{it was not possible to}} install fyke nets, thereby a simple, economical system with four waterproof video cameras, IR-spotlights and a computer equipped with an observation software was used. The cameras were installed at upper and lower entrance of the lock. Over a period of 127 controlling days about 1400 fish of 12 species were sighted while leaving the upper entrance. Unfortunately the observation of the lower entrance showed a significant lack of entering the lock. Many fishes hesitated to enter the lock chamber or leave it again. Because of this, different parameters of the lock were changed: duration of the <b>lock</b> <b>cycle</b> (especially the duration of entering period), reduction of flow velocity in the lock chamber and installing a daylight spotlight within the chamber. Especially the illumination tends to result in higher passage rates. Also shorter entering periods of maximum 20 minutes show slight effects. The period to exit the chamber should take about 30 minutes, but most of the individuals leave the chamber within the first 3 minutes after opening the door. There is no evidence that the fish lock is used by a significant amount of downstream migrating fish. In spring 2015 the investigations will be continued to show more clearly the efficiency of the illumination and the duration of entrance period...|$|R
