5000|$|A vacuum {{mattress}} {{consists of a}} sealed air-tight (typically polymer) bag enclosing small beads (typically polystyrene balls) and fitted {{with one or more}} valves. While at ambient air pressure, the beads free to move, but when the mattress has been moulded and the air evacuated, external atmospheric pressure <b>locks</b> the <b>beads</b> in place (jamming) and the mattress becomes rigid.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} styles of beadlocks. For 4-wheel drive vehicles, a ring {{with a number}} of bolts around the {{circumference}} is used to clamp the tire to the wheel. For motorcycles, a rim <b>lock</b> or <b>bead</b> stopper is a curved plate tightened by a single bolt. For both 4-wheel drive vehicles and motorcycles, a different style of beadlock can be used that is similar to an inner tube which is inflated to press the tire against the wheel.|$|R
5000|$|Motorcycle tires use a {{different}} style of beadlock, {{also known as a}} rim <b>lock</b> or <b>bead</b> stopper. Motorcycle tire rim <b>locks</b> clamp both <b>beads</b> at once because the tire is narrow enough do this conveniently with one device, and also {{there is no such thing}} as an [...] "inside bead" [...] and [...] "outside bead" [...] on a motorcycle tire. A curved metal plate inside the tire presses both beads outward against the inside of the wheel rim to clamp both beads at once in one localized area. A threaded stem attached to the plate is placed through a hole in the [...] "well" [...] of the rim, with the plate inside the tire and the threaded stem on the outside. The rim lock is tightened using either a standard bolt that leaves the threads visible, or a special bolt that covers the threads. The threaded stem or special bolt is visible on the inner surface of the wheel and points towards the axle, just like the valve stem.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bead</b> <b>lock</b> {{may also}} {{refer to a}} product used to secure a {{swimming}} pool liner into the pool liner track installed on many above ground pools. It has a wedge shaped edge {{on the front of}} the strip. When installing the strip, it inserts just above the pool liner <b>bead.</b> It then <b>locks</b> the liner into the receiving track.|$|R
5000|$|Most bicycle {{tires are}} {{clincher}} {{for use with}} [...] "clincher" [...] rims. These tires have a steel wire or Kevlar fiber bead that interlocks with flanges in the rim. A separate airtight inner tube enclosed by the rim supports the tire carcass and maintains the <b>bead</b> <b>lock.</b> An advantage of this system is that the inner tube can be easily accessed {{in the case of}} a leak to be patched or replaced.|$|R
50|$|When weaving on a loom, the <b>beads</b> are <b>locked</b> {{in between}} the warp threads by the weft threads. The most common bead weaving {{technique}} requires two passes of the weft thread. First, an entire row of beads is strung on the weft thread. Then the beads are pressed {{in between the}} warp threads. The needle is passed back through the beads above the warp threads to <b>lock</b> the <b>beads</b> into place. Heddle looms were popular {{near the beginning of}} the 20th century. They allowed weaving of beads by raising every other thread and inserting strung beads in the shed, the space between the lowered and raised threads. There are still a few Heddle Bead Looms being manufactured today. The most difficult part of loomwork is finishing off the warp threads.|$|R
50|$|A {{beadlock}} or <b>bead</b> <b>lock</b> is {{a mechanical}} device that secures the bead of a tire {{to the wheel}} of a vehicle. Tires and wheels are designed so that, when the tire is inflated, the tire pressure pushes the bead of the tire against the inside of the wheel rim so that the tire stays on the wheel and the two rotate together. In situations where tire pressure is insufficient to hold the bead of the tire in place, a beadlock is needed.|$|R
5000|$|Most bicycle rims are [...] "{{clincher}}" [...] rims for {{use with}} clincher tires. These tires have a wire or aramid (Kevlar or Twaron) fiber bead that interlocks with flanges in the rim. A separate airtight inner tube enclosed by the rim supports the tire carcass and maintains the <b>bead</b> <b>lock.</b> If the inner part of the rim where the inner tube fits has spoke holes, they must be covered by a rim tape or strip, usually rubber, cloth, or tough plastic, to protect the inner tube.|$|R
5000|$|Tubeless {{tires are}} {{primarily}} used on mountain bikes {{due to their}} ability to use low air pressure for better traction without getting pinch flats. Tubeless tires work similarly to clinchers in that the bead of the tire is specifically designed to interlock into a corresponding tubeless rim, but without an inner tube. Air is inflated directly into the tire, and once [...] "locked" [...] into the rim, the system is airtight. Liquid sealants are often injected into tubeless tires to prevent punctures. Pinch flats are impossible in a tubeless setup because there is no tube to pinch; however, air can escape if the <b>bead</b> <b>lock</b> is compromised from too much lateral force on the tire or deformation of the rim/tire due to hard impact with an object. Tubeless technology has progressed significantly over the last few years, and road-specific tubeless technologies for narrow tires are now gaining popularity.|$|R
40|$|In {{the frame}} of the Nădlac-Arad Motorway project 12 graves were exca- vated from the Late Avar period near Nădlac. According to the {{analysis}} of the burial customs, various object categories of the material culture (<b>lock</b> rings, earring, <b>beads,</b> components of belts with mounts, knives, potteries) can be dated {{to the end of the}} late Avar era, which corresponds to the late 8 th or early 9 th century. It can firmly be stated that some of the finds were the products of the latest metallurgical horizon (e. g. the punched belt-hole guard mount and the belt mounts with pendants) so some of the types found here can be connected to the last horizon, which is very important concerning their dating. The identity of the micro-community in Nădlac and their self-identification with a political community were influenced by the fact that they were a primary group. For them their micro- and macro-community traditions and their values and traditions at a micro-community level coming from their way of life might have been much more important than their ethnic identity. According to the clusters of late Avar sites and the supposed location of the hypothetical ‘workshop circles’ in the Carpathian Basin, it is clear that the cemetery researched by us and its micro-region is situated outside the central territories. It seems to be supported by the heterogeneity of the belt sets, which shows that the members of this community had more difficulty obtaining the various decorations. The anthropological deformations indicating hard physical work also seem to underpin this ‘peripheral’ status. Its loca- tion seems to show clearly that this micro-region, and within this the cemetery of this animal breeding and agricultural pagan population, is on the periphery of the power centre(s) of the Great Plain. They were the common people of the late Avar Khaganate in the eastern region of the Great Plain. We can talk about the cemetery of a settlement from the late Avar period, which was on the periphery, under the Khagan or some other Avar chief or big man (tudun, iugurus) ...|$|R
