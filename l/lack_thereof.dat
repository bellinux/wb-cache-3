5|$|While the dinosaur-bird {{connection}} (or <b>lack</b> <b>thereof)</b> {{was being}} pursued in paleontology, {{the problem of}} the evolution of flight was under scrutiny as well. It was observed that a number of animals with moderate flying or gliding ability, such as bats, flying lizards and flying squirrels have arboreal lifestyles. This led to the idea that the ancestors of birds must have gradually acquired the ability to fly from leaping among branches in the tops of trees. The Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa proposed an alternate hypothesis in 1907, arguing that the ancestors of birds were fast-running, bipedal animals related to theropod dinosaurs. When Heilmann came onto the paleontology scene, these two sets of conflicting theories provided the framework for his research and eventual conclusions.|$|E

5|$|The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{opened a}} file on Oppenheimer in March 1941.

Shortly thereafter, the FBI added Oppenheimer to its Custodial Detention Index, for arrest in case of national emergency.

50|$|Many {{students}} {{striving to}} analyze the Carlist popularity (or <b>lack</b> of <b>thereof)</b> point to socio-economic conditions, though conclusions offered by scholars from this school could be contradictory. The prevailing opinion holds that the movement flourished in rural areas with large commons and dominated by middle-size holdings, at least self-sustainable but usually able to enter the market exchange. This type of units provided economic grounds for peasant owners, the social base of Carlism, and was frequent in the Northern belt of Spain. Whenever this social group was giving way to peasant owners of small, non-sustainable plots, landless peasants, tenants or jornaleros, the rural workers - like {{was the case in}} New Castile or Andalusia, home to many Spanish landowners - Carlism was losing its base. In industrialized areas the ensuing social mobility was undermining traditional life patterns and undercutting the Carlist popularity. Rapidly growing urban proletariat, though not entirely immune to Carlist propaganda, tended to embrace anarchism and socialism instead.|$|R
40|$|Trachypogon spicatus, {{formerly}} known as Trachypogon plumosus, is a dominant grass in some savannas of Northern South America. Its dispersal unit, like many other species of the Andropogoneae tribe, bears a hygroscopic awn which facilitates its establishment in favorable microsites. Some authors have previously proposed {{that there is a}} positive correlation between awn length and dispersal unit burial, and that this relationship increases the probability of seed survival {{in the event of a}} fire, since soil acts as insulator. In this study we experimentally tested this relationship for T. spicatus. A total of 192 diaspores were placed in randomized blocks, in aluminum trays filled with soil under greenhouse conditions. Diaspores were sprayed with water daily for a month to guarantee awn movement; on the last day of the experiment, they were sprayed with red aerosol paint to determine burial depth. The effects of awn length, presence of caryopses, and presence of a pivot for the passive segment of the awn on diaspore burial were evaluated. Germination viability was tested using a tetrazolium salt test for 35 caryopses. No significant differences in diaspore burial were observed between diaspores with and without caryopses (F(2, 126) = 0. 034, p= 0. 853). A positive correlation between awn length and diaspore burial was observed only if the passive awn lacked a pivot (r(66) = 0. 394, p< 0. 05). Diaspores whose awns had a pivot point achieved significantly deeper burial distances than their counterparts (F(2, 126) = 7. 063, p= 0. 005). Viability test found that 0 % of caryopses tested were able to germinate; this is possibly due to the time difference between sampling and testing. We considered the presence or absence of caryopsis as an important factor, since previous studies have not yet considered it and the high production of sterile diaspores in grasses. These results suggest that the physical mechanism behind T. spicatus diaspore burial is awn torque. This would explain why our results partially support the hypothesis previously proposed by other authors regarding the effect of awn length upon dispersal unit burial, but would also account for the differences observed in burial depth between diaspores with an available pivot point for the passive awn and diaspores <b>lacking</b> <b>thereof.</b> Rev.

Our analysis shows that technical support is more frequently acknowledged by scholars in Chemistry, Physics and Engineering. Earth and Space, Professional Fields, and Social Sciences are more likely to acknowledge contributions from colleagues, editors, and reviewers, while Biology acknowledgments put more emphasis on logistics and fieldwork-related tasks. Conflicts of interest disclosures (or <b>lack</b> of <b>thereof)</b> are more frequently found in acknowledgments from Clinical Medicine, Health and, to a lesser extent, Psychology.

The issue at hand {{is the study of}} democratic transition, and whether or not such a transition can be expected in the future of North Korea, as compared with Romania The main difference between the two nations, and thusly, the reason for collapse in one nation and continued rule in the other, is the East Asian cultural influence of Confucianism. This thesis demonstrates how a despotic Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong- 11 implemented their self-reliant Juche philosophy upon a disempowered and deferential Korean people, whereas an equally despotic and Juche-influenced Nicolae Ceausescu did not find the same deference in his people, which ultimately led to Romanian transition. The cultural school cannot take complete credit for all democratic transitions, but it can certainly explain culture has influence and implications on the way the powerful make decisions, and how his or her people respond to such decisions. By defining and exploring all three schools of transitional thought, and by comparatively analyzing two dissimilarly located regions with similar leaders and institutions, yet different cultures and contrasting outcomes, culture will prove to {{play a significant role in}} regime fall and democratic transition, and the <b>lack</b> of <b>thereof...</b>|$|R

We evaluate empirical validity of this approach on a sample of 377 foreign subsidiaries located in CEE countries. Our results (multinomial logit models) show that the proposed typology has the power to define internally consistent positions which are differentiated along four variables representing widely understood interdependencies within an MNE (sales dependence, sourcing dependence, technological dependence of the foreign investor upon the subsidiary and technological dependence of the subsidiary upon the MNE) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparison}} of glacial advances {{through the last}} glacial cycle between Northern and Southern Hemispheres in the PEP 2 transect (East Asia and Australasia) revealed (1) a relatively good synchrony of glacial advances during the LGM across the whole transect except Antarctica, (2) a rough synchrony in glacial advances in the Karakorums, Himalayas, Japan, and New Zealand during Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 3 and 4, although the age control is still poor, and (1) a greater glacial extent in MIS 3 and 4 than in MIS 2. The LGM advances are driven by Northern Hemisphere temperature forcing, but the MIS 3 and/or MIS 4 advances appear to be dominantly controlled by the effects of moisture availability or <b>lack</b> of <b>thereof.</b> In mainland Australia and Antarctica glaciers advanced only in the most humid phases. In Himalaya and Karakorum, where the moisture is supplied both by a Summer monsoon and the westerlies, timings of glacier advance coincide with both Summer monsoon enhancement and westerly intensification. In Japan the glacier extent is controlled by monsoon changes, sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Japan Sea (moisture source) and by zonal shifts in westerly circulation. In New Zealand, either insolalion changes or changes in the intensity of westerly circulation are invoked, Lis the main track of the westerlies did not change greatly during glacial times.
