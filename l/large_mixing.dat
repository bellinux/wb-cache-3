He began studying the piano at the age of four years, and in his teens worked to gain a scholarship to Trinity College of Music in London. There, he learned the play the organ, then transferred to the University of Bristol in 1966 to study electronic engineering, a decision made easier because he was [...] "hopelessly infatuated with an astonishingly pretty girl from my social group at home who'd gone up the year before." [...] At Bristol, Blyth founded the Student Music Society, and studied orchestra conducting; as a senior he conducted a performance of Bach's complex masterpiece St Matthew Passion. After college, he obtained a position with the Compton Organ Company in their research department where he met Bill Kelsey, his early mentor, who showed him how to lay out circuits on printed circuit boards. Compton was [...] "on its last legs", according to Blyth, and he left to join Graseby Instruments where he designed electronic filters for underwater weapons to satisfy Admiralty contracts. Blyth spent evenings at Kelsey's Notting Hill flat helping him assemble a <b>large</b> <b>mixing</b> desk, one used by Emerson, Lake & Palmer at the [...] "legendary" [...] Isle of Wight Festival 1970.

50|$|Food {{processing}} {{is typically}} a mechanical process that utilizes <b>large</b> <b>mixing,</b> grinding, chopping and emulsifying {{equipment in the}} production process. These processes inherently introduce a number of contamination risks. As a mixing bowl or grinder is used over time the food contact parts will tend to fail and fracture. This type of failure will introduce into the product stream small to large metal contaminants. Further processing of these metal fragments will result in downstream equipment failure {{and the risk of}} ingestion by the consumer. Food manufacturers utilize industrial metal detectors to detect and reject automatically any metal fragment. Large food processors will utilize many metal detectors within the processing stream to reduce both damage to processing machinery as well as risk to consumer health.|$|E

The quadraphonic mixing desk designed in the early 1970s was still in use in the late 1980s by Radiotracks, though in a different building. The desk had been built {{to take advantage of the}} quadraphonic technology that had been pioneered for music, though this never became popular and the desk was never used for that purpose in its music days. Instead the quadraphonic system on the desk was put to good use for mixing soundtracks for large events, including a celebration of 800 years of the Lord Mayors of London at the Guildhall.

40|$|The SuperKamiokande data on {{atmospheric}} neutrinos {{imply that}} ν_μ has large (or even maximal) mixing. It {{is still open}} question whether this mixing is the flavor one or mixing with singlet state (sterile neutrino). Several tests exist to establish the channel of atmospheric neutrino oscillations. <b>Large</b> <b>mixing</b> can be a property of {{the second and third}} generations, so that the scheme with single <b>large</b> <b>mixing</b> is realized. It can be a generic property of all leptons, thus leading to the bi-large or threefold <b>large</b> <b>mixing</b> schemes. The ambiguity will be resolved by identification of solution of the solar neutrino problem. In this review we consider phenomenology of various mixing schemes. The key measurements which will allow us to make significant step in reconstruction of the neutrino mass and flavor spectrum are discussed. Comment: LaTeX, Moriond. sty, 14 pages, 8 eps figures.

40|$|We discuss {{models of}} {{neutrino}} masses {{that lead to}} a <b>large</b> <b>mixing</b> angle for atmospheric neutrino oscillations. In particular we study a mechanism where a simple texture for the Dirac matrix leads to the observed pattern of mixings for a continuous range of Majorana matrices in a reasonably natural way. Both nearly maximal and small mixing solutions for solar neutrinos are compatible with this model. Possible dynamical realizations are discussed and a detailed example in terms of horizontal U(1) charges is presented. CERN-TH/ 98 - 310 DFPD- 98 /TH/ 46 September 1998 Following the experimental results from Superkamiokande [1] {{a lot of attention}} has been devoted to the problem of a natural explanation of the observed nearly maximal mixing angle for atmospheric neutrino oscillations. It is possible that also solar neutrino oscillations, if explained by vacuum oscillations, occur with a <b>large</b> <b>mixing</b> angle [2]. <b>Large</b> <b>mixing</b> angles are somewhat unexpected because the observed quark mixings are small and the quark, charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices are to some extent related in Grand Unified Theories.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{scenario}} which naturally provides bi-maximal neutrino mixings for a simultaneous {{explanation of the}} recent atmospheric and solar neutrino data. A crucial role is played by an anomalous flavor U(1) symmetry, which is also important for a natural understanding of charged fermion mass hierarchies and magnitudes of the CKM matrix elements. Within MSSM the solar neutrino problem can be resolved either through vacuum oscillations or the <b>large</b> <b>mixing</b> angle MSW solution. In supersymmetric GUTs such as SU(5) and SO(10) the MSW solution is realized. If the flavor U(1) also mediates supersymmetry breaking, the vacuum solution in MSSM is eliminated, and only the <b>large</b> <b>mixing</b> angle MSW solution survives. ...|$|E
