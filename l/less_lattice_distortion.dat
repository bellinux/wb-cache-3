The magnetic moment is 0. 30 μB at 5 K in {{the magnetic field}} of 1 T, indicating that B site cations of Fe and Mn are disordered in the sample. The zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) magnetization curves measured from 2 K to 400 K coincide at 360 K.

A spin-glass-like behaviour was observed at low temperature (∼ 100 K) with a cusp of 25 K. Mn shows multiple valence states in the film.

40|$|Meso-scale surface {{roughening}} {{evolution in}} 6022 -T 4 Al sheets was investigated using plane-strain tension. Formation of grain-scale hills and valleys and {{their relation to}} the morphologies and corresponding orientations of surface grains after deformation were examined experimentally. These observations were analyzed using various approaches based on the Schmid and Taylor crystal plasticity models. It was observed that surface grains with and without slip bands tend to form valleys and hills, respectively, wherever {{these two types of}} grains are adjacent to each other along the planestrain tension direction. When the sample was pulled along the transverse direction, the formation of hills and valleys by unbanded and banded grains was more lineally organized in the plane-strain (rolling) direction than in the sample which was pulled along the rolling direction. Slip banding and valley formation were principally observed in the surface grains with either very few (1 ∼ 2) slip systems of high Schmid factors or low Taylor factors, in contrast to non slip-banded and hillforming surface grains. Quantitative analysis using correlation coefficients showed that the Schmid factor provided slightly better agreement than the Taylor factor in predicting slip-banding (and valley-forming) and non slip-banding (and hill-forming) behaviors of surface grains. In addition, measures that quantify the image qualities of EBSPs for selected surface grains suggested that the slip-banded and valley-forming grains contain <b>less</b> <b>lattice</b> <b>distortion</b> than the non slip-banded and Currently at Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, PAhill-forming grains despite the larger strains experienced by these grains. This indicates that dislocations in the slip-banded grains move out of the surface to create deformation without lattice distortion. Plastic interactions between specific neighboring grains are central to the formation of meso-scale surface roughening. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{temperature}} dependence of <b>lattice</b> <b>distortion</b> and crystallite size of polyethylene was discussed {{from the analysis}} of the diffraction profile measured over the temperature range from 4. 5 °K to 300 °K. The integral breadth was obtained from the profile using the analytical function composed of the Gaussian and Lorentzian functions. The integral breadth increased with lowering the temperature. This process is reversible. From the fact that the ratio of the integral breadth of 400 reflection to that of 200 one increased at low temperatures, the increase of integral breadth was found to be due mainly to the increase of <b>lattice</b> <b>distortion.</b> The <b>lattice</b> <b>distortion</b> and crystallite size were quantitatively estimated by the method of integral breadth in terms of the micro-strain or paracrystalline disorder.
