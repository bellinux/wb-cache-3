500|$|Harris and Graeme-Evans based {{the series}} around an {{underlying}} educational structure, primarily using Howard Gardner's Theory of multiple intelligences. It is recognised that each child learns {{in a different}} way, and each cast member has a specific segment within the show which targets a different aspect of learning, ranging from logical-mathematical thinking to a focus on linguistic skills, to cater to a child's individual learning approach. Harris observed that most viewers had a favourite cast member, believing that children generally [...] "respond more favourably to the presenter who models the learning style they prefer". The use of multiple segments is also designed to hold the attention span of young children. The skills of pre-numeracy and pre-literacy are a focus of the educational theory, to prepare children for <b>learning</b> <b>at</b> <b>school,</b> while also encouraging self-confidence and expression. According to the show's website, Hi-5 also uses Piaget's theory of cognitive development, providing a learning experience that promotes individual growth.|$|E

6000|$|Here Maitland's {{three sons}} are <b>learning</b> <b>at</b> <b>school,</b> as Scots often were educated in France. They see that Edward's {{standard}} quarters {{the arms of}} France, and infer that he has conquered their country. They [...] "will try some jeopardy." [...] Persuading the English that they are themselves Englishmen, they ask leave to carry the royal flag. The eldest is told that he is singularly like Auld Maitland. In anger he stabs the standard-bearer, seizes the flag, and, with his brothers, spurs to Billop-Grace, where the French captain receives them. There is fighting at the gate. The King says that three disguised lads of France have stolen his flag. The Maitlands apparently heard of this; the youngest goes to Edward, and explains that they are Maitland's sons, and Scots; they challenge any three Englishmen; a thing {{in the manner of}} the period. The three Scots are victorious. Young Edward then challenges one of the dauntless three, who slays him. Edward wishes himself home at London Tower.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Now behold,' he went on, 'how {{the curse}} of the Gods falls upon Herodotus. For he pretends that he saw Cadmeian {{inscriptions}} at Thebes. Now I do not believe there were any Cadmeian inscriptions there: therefore Herodotus is most manifestly lying. Moreover, this Herodotus never speaks of Sophocles the Athenian, and why not? Because he, being a child <b>at</b> <b>school,</b> did not <b>learn</b> Sophocles by heart: for the tragedies of Sophocles could not have been <b>learned</b> <b>at</b> <b>school</b> before they were written, nor can any man quote a poet whom he never <b>learned</b> <b>at</b> <b>school.</b> Moreover, as all those about Herodotus knew Sophocles well, he could not appear to them to be learned by showing that he knew what they knew also.' Then I thought the priest was making game and sport, saying first that Herodotus could know no poet whom he had not <b>learned</b> <b>at</b> <b>school,</b> and then saying that all the men of his time well knew this poet, 'about whom everyone was talking'. But the priest seemed not to know that Herodotus and Sophocles were friends, which is proved by this, that Sophocles wrote an ode in praise of Herodotus.|$|R

50|$|For a {{child or}} {{adolescent}} {{to qualify for a}} diagnosis of ODD, behaviours must cause considerable distress for the family or interfere significantly with academic or social functioning. Interference might take the form of preventing the child or adolescent from <b>learning</b> <b>at</b> <b>school</b> or making friends, or placing him or her in harmful situations. These behaviours must also persist for at least six months. Effects of ODD can be greatly amplified by other disorders in comorbidity such as ADHD. Other common comorbid disorders include depression and substance use disorders.|$|E
50|$|The BSRA is {{a widely}} used {{kindergarten}} readiness test that measures a child’s exposure to concepts that support <b>learning</b> <b>at</b> <b>school.</b> It contains five subtests assessing knowledge of colours, letters, numbers/counting, size/comparisons, and shapes. Unlike a questionnaire, the BSRA is structured {{as a set of}} tests to be completed with the child. The BSRA is used in some public and private schools to determine eligibility for gifted and talented programs. Studies have shown that children’s scores on the BSRA are predictive of their later academic outcomes (Panter & Bracken, 2009).|$|E

Miserably indeed, students learn everything, from answers of English grammar questions to essays, by heart. All questions asked in tests are seen. Exceptionally, some tests of grade 5, grade 9, grade 11 are unseen unless the test papers are secreted. Many universities have been built and scattered throughout cities to prevent students participation in potential unrest.|$|E
50|$|Laxman Mahadeo Chitale {{was born}} in a family with meagre {{financial}} resources in 1892 in Ratnagiri district of the western Indian state of Maharashtra. With a penchant for drawing, he secured a scholarship from Sayajirao Gaekwad III, then Maharaja of Baroda, and studied draughtsman's course at Kala Bhavan Technical Institute, Baroda. During this period, Chitale got an opportunity to meet Henry Vaughan Lanchester, a known architect, who hired him as his assistant. In 1922, when Lanchester shifted to UK, Chitale accompanied him. There, he joined the School of Architecture of London University for higher studies and continued <b>learning</b> <b>at</b> <b>School</b> of Town Planning. Later, he qualified as an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects, followed it by securing the fellowship of the institute.|$|E
50|$|Supplemental private tutoring, or ‘shadow education’, which {{represents}} one specific {{dimension of the}} privatization of education, is also growing worldwide. Often a symptom of badly functioning school systems, private tutoring, much like other manifestations of private education, can have {{both positive and negative}} effects for learners and their teachers. On one hand, teaching can be tailored to the needs of slower learners and teachers can supplement their school salaries. On the other hand, fees for private tutoring may represent a sizeable share of household income, particularly among the poor, and can therefore create inequalities in learning opportunities. And the fact that some teachers may put more effort into private tutoring and neglect their regular duties can adversely affect the quality of teaching and <b>learning</b> <b>at</b> <b>school.</b> The growth of shadow education, the financial resources mobilized by individuals and families, and the concerns regarding possible teacher misconduct and corruption are leading some ministries of education to attempt to regulate the phenomenon.|$|E

In five one-hour meetings three apprentices refreshed their statistical knowledge (e. g., correlation, regression, variation coefficient) in relation to the work task of comparing two measurement machines (including linearity, stability, reproducibility). Data collection involved video and audio recordings of the meetings and students’ data from their research projects as well as interviews with two teachers and two workplace supervisors. An analysis of the apprentices’ reasoning during the meetings revealed that the level of integrating mathematical-statistical and work-related reasons increased significantly and with medium effect sizes both at group and individual level...|$|R

50|$|Since the 1970s, in a {{centralized}} {{system that was}} designed to significantly reduce the rate of illiteracy, the Algerian government introduced a decree by which school attendance became compulsory for all children aged between 6 and 15 years who have the ability to track their learning through the 20 facilities built since independence, now the literacy rate is around 78.7%.Since 1972, Arabic is used as the language of instruction during the first nine years of schooling. From the third year, French is taught and it is also the language of instruction for science classes. The students can also learn English, Italian, Spanish and German. In 2008, new programs at the elementary appeared, therefore the compulsory schooling does not start at the age of six anymore, but at the age of five.Apart from the 122 private, <b>learning</b> <b>at</b> <b>school,</b> the Universities of the State are free of charge.

5000|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} and learning have continually been linked together. The common {{belief is that}} sleep deprivation can affect children when they are <b>learning</b> <b>at</b> <b>school</b> or in any daily task. However, different types of learning are processed differently and have different outcomes {{when a child is}} sleep deprived. A study conducted by Csabi, Benedk, Janacesk, Katona and Nemeth looked at the impairment of declarative and nondeclarative learning when a child is sleep deprived. Nondeclarative learning was measured by having children perform an Alternating Serial Reaction Time (ASRT) task. This task had a dog's head appear in four empty circles. Every time the dog's head appeared the child had to press the corresponding letter as quickly and correctly as possible. Declarative learning was measured by [...] "The War of the Ghosts" [...] test, which is a recall test where the children were told a short story consisting of thirty-six sentences and had to then recall it immediately after hearing it. The study showed that nondeclarative learning was preserved and not affected when sleep deprived children took the ASRT task. However, declarative learning greatly declined in the face of sleep-deprivation. Declarative Learning can be associated with tasks that require a greater amount of attention, such as learning in school. Therefore, the lack of sleep a child obtains can affect declarative learning and can affect how well a child learns during school overall.|$|E
