25|$|And when he intimated {{over the}} entr√©e that the {{wrongdoing}} went further, I {{leaned back against}} the wall on my inside banquette and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> frank astonishment.|$|E
2500|$|Once, after {{standing}} on the top rails of a corral above the thick dust covering a bunch of running horses, {{almost all of them}} paints, he dropped to the ground as the gate swung shut and announced, [...] "By golly, boys, I'm a rich man; I've got 42 head of horses!" [...] A woman standing close by <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> utter amazement and blurted out, [...] "How could you count all those horses, Mr. Long ... Why ... There was so much dust you couldn't see your hand in front of your face." [...] Reub looked at the woman almost apologetically and said, [...] "Why it was easy, ma'am, I just counted all the legs and divided by four." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> blank amazement. The thing seemed impossible.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Buffin did {{not affect}} to misunderstand. Sid Marks was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> that nasty way. Otto the Sausage was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> that nasty way. Rabbit Butler was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> that nasty way. This was an {{occasion}} where manly frankness was the quality most to be aimed at. To be misunderstood in the circles in which Mr. Buffin moved meant something more than the mere risk of being treated with cold displeasure.|$|R
60|$|She did not retreat, but {{continued}} <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a half-surly embarrassment.|$|R
60|$|Cameron and Joe stood <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> {{a sort of}} {{wondering}} admiration.|$|R
60|$|Grahame <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> wonder, and Brott faced him sturdily.|$|E
60|$|Marian lost {{confidence}} again, and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> silent distress.|$|E
60|$|I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> surprise. He {{repeated}} the movement--a grotesque one.|$|E
60|$|Evan MacIan was {{standing}} {{a few yards}} off <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> absolute silence.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Pett was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a meditative way. Jimmy {{caught his}} eye.|$|R
60|$|She said nothing, but {{continued}} <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> {{a way that}} was as shy as it was sweet.|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> surprise, {{scarcely}} {{understanding what}} he could mean.|$|E
60|$|Desmond, {{who still}} hesitated, <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a curious deprecatory fashion.|$|E
60|$|We <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> such {{horror that}} Dan hastened to apologize.|$|E
60|$|Sam {{walked slowly}} to the bow. As he did this, Wingate turned to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a {{speculative}} way.|$|R
60|$|Lady Dedlock <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> stern inquiry. Mr. Guppy {{immediately}} withdraws {{his eyes}} from her face and looks anywhere else.|$|R
6000|$|... "Marrying Sibyl Vane!" [...] cried Lord Henry, {{standing}} up, and <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> perplexed amazement. [...] "But, my dear Dorian----" ...|$|R
60|$|John Westlock put {{the teapot}} down, and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>in</b> astonishment.|$|E
60|$|Marvel <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> amazement, {{and then}} burst into joyous laughter.|$|E
60|$|The {{undertaker}} <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> perplexity, and {{he hurried}} to explain.|$|E
6000|$|... "But what for?" [...] Archie asked sharply, and Griffin, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> {{surprise}} {{because he}} thus interrupted the conversation, said curtly: ...|$|R
60|$|His {{voice was}} hard and stern. He spoke with a {{peculiar}} abruptness that made the poor woman <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> amazement.|$|R
60|$|Ralph {{had drawn}} the Times towards him, {{and he did}} not notice my start. I sat <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> blank amazement.|$|R
60|$|He was {{absolutely}} wringing his hands. My uncle <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> silence.|$|E
60|$|Again Waynefleet <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> astonishment, for Gordon's {{tone was}} very suggestive.|$|E
60|$|All <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> wonder, save Nibs, who {{fortunately}} {{looked at}} Wendy.|$|E
60|$|The other did not reply, but stood <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>in</b> {{so strange}} and earnest a way, that Desmond felt almost uneasy.|$|R
2500|$|RUTH: (who {{has been}} <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> wonder during this speech) Smailey! That's never you! (Mr. Smailey falls {{back in his}} chair.) ...|$|R
60|$|It {{hurt him}} that any woman should <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> such a fashion, <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{who had always}} held womanhood in such reverence.|$|R
60|$|It was Jill's {{turn to be}} startled. She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> astonishment.|$|E
60|$|Magdalen drew {{further and}} further back, and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> rising alarm.|$|E
60|$|Hugh {{opened his}} eyes on hearing this, and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> great surprise.|$|E
60|$|I did not reply. I stood <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> silence. For {{the sight}} of him had opened up a new line of thought.|$|R
60|$|I stood <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> silence. Strange, horrible {{thoughts}} {{passed through}} my head and I could not drive them away. I tried to speak quite calmly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Sir William is a {{wonderful}} man," [...] said the Colonel. [...] "Well--we won't say so before him. But let us <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> his orders." ...|$|R
