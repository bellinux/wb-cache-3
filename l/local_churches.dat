5|$|During the Middle Ages, farming was {{the most}} {{important}} activity in the area, and farming, both arable and dairy, continues today. There were also orchards producing fruits such as apples, pears, and plums. Evidence exists of lime kilns, used in the production of mortar for the construction of <b>local</b> <b>churches.</b>|$|E
5|$|Reflecting its Methodist heritage, the IPHC {{is governed}} under the {{principles}} of connectionalism, a mixed system of episcopal and congregational polity. Authority in the church is shared between <b>local</b> <b>churches,</b> quadrennial conferences, and the General Conference.|$|E

25|$|Some {{church members}} {{belong to a}} church council, either {{because they have been}} elected by the <b>local</b> <b>church</b> members, or because they hold {{one of a number of}} offices within the <b>local</b> <b>church.</b> The church council, with a minister, has {{responsibility}} for running the <b>local</b> <b>church.</b> Members of the church council are also trustees of the <b>local</b> <b>church.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1977 InterVarsity Press {{released}} an 80-page booklet by the SCP called The God-Men: Witness Lee and the <b>Local</b> <b>Church.</b> It was updated and released as a full-length book in 1981 as The God-Men: An Inquiry into Witness Lee and the <b>Local</b> <b>Church.</b> The book presented {{the results of}} SCP's investigations into the theology and practices of the <b>Local</b> <b>Church.</b> The SCP findings alleged that the <b>Local</b> <b>Church</b> was promulgating heresy. The dispute between the <b>Local</b> <b>Church</b> and the SCP escalated into a lawsuit for defamation that was filed in Oakland, California in December 1980 and known as Lee v. Duddy.|$|R
5|$|Some women's organisations, {{such as the}} Cook Islands National Council of Women and the Cook Islands Business and Professional Women's Association, have {{difficulty}} separating themselves from national politics. The largest women's organisations, Cook Islands Christian Church Ekalesia Vainetini, Dorcas, National Catholic Women's League, and Women's Harvesters, are affiliated with <b>local</b> <b>churches.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{pilgrimage to}} the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey was held by a few <b>local</b> <b>churches</b> in 1924. Pilgrimages {{continue}} today to be held; {{in the second half}} of June for the Anglicans and early in July for the Catholics and they attract visitors from all over Western Europe. Services are celebrated in the Anglican, Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions. The abbey site is visited by over 100,000 a year.|$|E
5|$|Many {{community}} {{projects in}} Shrewsbury are based in, {{or have been}} started by <b>local</b> <b>churches,</b> including the Isaiah 58 project, which is the primary work amongst homeless people in the town, whilst 'Churches Together in Shrewsbury' works to help homeless people through the Ark project.

5|$|The {{constitution}} of the AFM blends {{at the national level}} the elements of a presbyterian polity with an episcopal polity. Decentralization is a major feature of its constitution, which allows <b>local</b> <b>churches</b> to develop their own policies. The Apostolic Faith Mission displays a variety of identities and ministry philosophies, including seeker-sensitive, Word of Faith, Presbyterian, and classical Pentecostal.|$|E
5|$|The county {{also has}} several private schools {{supported}} by <b>local</b> <b>churches.</b> St. John's, a Lutheran school near Lanesville, has 77 pupils. St. Joseph's, a Catholic school in Corydon, has 87 pupils. County high school students, {{including those in}} public, private, and home schools, may attend the vocational school C. A. Prosser school of Technology in neighboring Floyd County {{as part of their}} high school curriculum.|$|E
5|$|While {{crossing}} northern Madagascar, Nadia produced widespread flooding. In Vohemar {{where it}} moved ashore, the storm destroyed most public buildings, although <b>local</b> <b>churches</b> provided {{assistance in the}} aftermath. Across the region, the storm downed power lines and destroyed more than 540tonnes (600tons) of rice. The cyclone killed 12people and caused about $200,000 damage (1994USD).|$|E

5000|$|The <b>local</b> <b>church</b> is {{a biblical}} {{principle}} which OICCU does {{not try to}} replace in the Christian's life: OICCU encourages all its members to also {{be part of a}} <b>local</b> <b>church</b> and to contribute to that family of believers.|$|R
50|$|In a <b>local</b> <b>church,</b> many {{decisions}} are made by an administrative board or council. This council {{is made up of}} laity representing various other organizations within the <b>local</b> <b>church.</b> The elder or local pastor sits on the council as a voting member.|$|R
5|$|Yet if the Benedictine reforms {{dominate}} the sources from this period, their wider impact {{should not be}} overstressed: large areas of England were affected only minimally, if at all. It was the emergence of small <b>local</b> <b>churches</b> {{and the development of}} new systems of pastoral care – processes only imperfectly documented – that would have the more enduring impact and more thoroughgoing effect on religious life in England.|$|E
5|$|In 1826, the Congregationalists joined these united efforts. The Congregational mission {{societies}} were {{merged with}} the United Domestic Missionary Society to become the American Home Missionary Society. The Congregational American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) became the recognized missions agency of the General Assembly, and the United Foreign Missionary Society's operations were {{merged with the}} American Board. By 1831, the majority of board members and missionaries of the ABCFM were Presbyterians. As a result, most of the <b>local</b> <b>churches</b> established by the organization were Presbyterian.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, {{in tandem}} with his work at All Souls, Henson acted as tutor to Lyle Rathbone, son of the philanthropic {{businessman}} William Rathbone. The family lived in Birkenhead, where for six months Henson stayed with them. He had ample leisure time, much of which he spent in visiting <b>local</b> <b>churches</b> and nonconformist chapels. This process left him struggling with doctrinal questions, but sure of a religious vocation. The day after his return to Oxford in October 1885 he went into St Mary's, Iffley, and {{with his hand on}} the altar vowed to dedicate himself to God and the Church.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} lay offices exist within the <b>local</b> <b>church,</b> {{including}} the ordained positions of elder and deacon. Elders and deacons are {{appointed by the}} vote of a <b>local</b> <b>church</b> business meeting or elected committees. Elders serve a mainly administrative and pastoral role, but must also be capable of providing religious leadership (particularly {{in the absence of}} an ordained minister). The role of deacons is to assist in the smooth functioning of a <b>local</b> <b>church</b> and to maintain church property.|$|R
50|$|<b>Local</b> <b>church</b> {{administrative}} structures vary, but the Book of Discipline {{calls for a}} board of Stewards and a board of Trustees to work {{in conjunction with the}} senior pastor. The senior pastor is responsible for oversight of the <b>local</b> <b>church's</b> ministries and other ministers.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{stewardship}} {{in the process}} of extending the <b>local</b> <b>church</b> This study looks at the biblical principal of stewardship in the context of building up the <b>local</b> <b>church.</b> The study starts with the methodological principles of Practical Theology and various models of the process of building up the <b>local</b> <b>church.</b> Traditionally stewardship was regarded as the principle that encouraged Christians to give monetary contributions towards extending the <b>local</b> <b>church.</b> The study makes it clear that a much broader and biblical understanding of stewardship is necessary. It looks at the different dimensions of stewardship and the effect the stewardship principle has on the Christian’s use of resources, time, spiritual gifts, possessions, as well as on creation, life and the Gospel of Jesus Christ. </p...|$|R
5|$|Like most of {{the smaller}} Cistercian houses, {{comparatively}} {{little is known about}} the internal history of the abbey. In its early years Cleeve received grants of land and property from local lords and the Crown to supplement its initial endowment and in the prosperous years of the thirteenth century grew steadily, reaching 26monks in 1297. The abbey held various <b>local</b> <b>churches,</b> including those at Cleeve, Queen Camel, Woolavington while also holding the rectory of Lundy. The abbey was also responsible for the chapel of Our Lady between Old Cleeve and what is now Blue Anchor; however although this has since disappeared, the inn for pilgrims attending the chapel has been expanded into the present Chapel Cleeve Manor.|$|E
5|$|Local {{assemblies}} {{are organized}} into geographical regions. Regional leadership forums are representative bodies consisting of pastors and delegates from each local assembly. Every three years, each forum elects a regional committee from {{among its members}} and a regional leader from among its pastors. The committee acts as an executive and advisory body to the regional leadership forum. Each region is represented by its leader on the National Leadership Forum. Non-geographical regions, {{in the form of}} networks of <b>local</b> <b>churches</b> that share a peculiar ministry philosophy, also exist. These are normally led by the senior pastors of urban mega-churches, who network with a number of local assemblies nationwide that look to them for leadership and mentorship.|$|E
5|$|<b>Local</b> <b>churches</b> {{were further}} {{organized}} into geographically defined presbyteries. A presbytery was {{a convention of}} all ministers within its jurisdiction and one ruling elder chosen by each session. Collegiate churches were entitled to be represented by two or more ruling elders {{in proportion to the}} number of its pastors. Presbyteries were responsible for examining, licensing and ordaining candidates to the ministry, as well as judging and removing ministers. They were also responsible for resolving doctrinal or disciplinary questions and also functioned as courts of appeal from sessions. An executive commission was appointed to more efficiently manage the presbytery's work, and judicial cases were referred to a judicial commission.|$|E

5|$|The church {{held the}} right to conduct the marriages of people {{throughout}} Manchester, not only from within its parish, until 1874. Despite this, there were no such services for the first 35 years of its existence, {{perhaps because of the}} continued popularity of the Collegiate Church as a venue for weddings but probably because the latter insisted on collecting its own fees for marriages held in other <b>local</b> <b>churches,</b> which effectively doubled the cost of being married at St John's rather than at the Collegiate Church. Later, after the rights of the Collegiate Church were curtailed, some weeks saw more than 100 marriage services at St John's in the years just before 1874.|$|E
5|$|In August 1906, a {{group of}} Cleveland Baptists {{incorporated}} an organization, the Baptist Home of Northern Ohio, to establish a retirement home for elderly Baptists. Ten months later, Southworth sold his house to the organization, which was supported financially by industrialist and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, who was a Baptist. With the aid of <b>local</b> <b>churches,</b> the home was opened on October 16, 1907. According to the 1910 census, the Baptist Home served fourteen residents {{at the end of}} 1910, at which time the entire property was worth $15,000. The former Southworth residence was not long a retirement home: the Baptist Home moved to a new location in 1919 and sold the Southworth House in the same year. Since that time, the house has been used {{for a wide range of}} purposes.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{conversion}} of London to Christianity in the early 7thcentury, the city's dead had been buried {{in and around the}} <b>local</b> <b>churches.</b> With a limited amount of space for burials, the oldest graves were regularly exhumed to free space for new burials, and the remains of the previous occupants transferred to charnel houses for storage. From the 14th century onwards the charnel houses themselves were overwhelmed, and exhumed bones were scattered where they had been dug up or reburied in pits. Despite this practice, by the mid 17thcentury the city was running seriously short of burial space. A proposal by Christopher Wren to use the reconstruction following the 1666 Great Fire of London as an opportunity to cease burials in the churchyards and establish new cemeteries outside the city was approved by the King and Parliament but vetoed by the Corporation of London, and burials continued at the newly rebuilt churches.|$|E
