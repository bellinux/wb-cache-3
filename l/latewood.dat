In choosing a piece of pine where strength or stiffness is the important consideration, the principal thing to observe is the comparative amounts of earlywood and <b>latewood.</b> The width of ring is not nearly so important as the proportion {{and nature of the}} <b>latewood</b> in the ring.|$|E
25|$|In ring-porous {{woods of}} good growth, {{it is usually}} the <b>latewood</b> in which the thick-walled, strength-giving fibers are most abundant. As the breadth of ring diminishes, this <b>latewood</b> is reduced so that very slow growth {{produces}} comparatively light, porous wood composed of thin-walled vessels and wood parenchyma. In good oak, these large vessels of the earlywood occupy from 6 to 10 percent of the volume of the log, while in inferior material they may make up 25% or more. The <b>latewood</b> of good oak is dark colored and firm, and consists mostly of thick-walled fibers which form one-half or more of the wood.

25|$|Since the <b>latewood</b> of {{a growth}} ring is usually darker in color than the earlywood, this fact {{may be used}} in {{visually}} judging the density, and therefore the hardness and strength of the material.

25|$|If a heavy {{piece of}} pine is {{compared}} with a lightweight piece it will be seen at once that the heavier one contains {{a larger proportion of}} <b>latewood</b> than the other, and is therefore showing more clearly demarcated growth rings.

25|$|If {{there are}} {{differences}} within a growth ring, then {{the part of a}} growth ring nearest the center of the tree, and formed early in the growing season when growth is rapid, is usually composed of wider elements. It is usually lighter in color than that near the outer portion of the ring, and is known as earlywood or springwood. The outer portion formed later in the season is then known as the <b>latewood</b> or summerwood. However, there are major differences, depending on the kind of wood (see below).|$|E
25|$|No {{satisfactory}} explanation can as yet {{be given}} for the exact mechanisms determining the formation of earlywood and <b>latewood.</b> Several factors may be involved. In conifers, at least, rate of growth alone does not determine {{the proportion of the}} two portions of the ring, for in some cases the wood of slow growth is very hard and heavy, while in others the opposite is true. The quality of the site where the tree grows undoubtedly affects the character of the wood formed, though {{it is not possible to}} formulate a rule governing it. In general, however, it may be said that where strength or ease of working is essential, woods of moderate to slow growth should be chosen.|$|E
25|$|In diffuse-porous woods, as {{has been}} stated, the vessels or pores are even-sized, so that the water {{conducting}} capability is scattered throughout the ring instead of collected in the earlywood. The effect of rate of growth is, therefore, {{not the same as}} in the ring-porous woods, approaching more nearly the conditions in the conifers. In general it may be stated that such woods of medium growth afford stronger material than when very rapidly or very slowly grown. In many uses of wood, total strength is not the main consideration. If ease of working is prized, wood should be chosen with regard to its uniformity of texture and straightness of grain, which will in most cases occur when there is little contrast between the <b>latewood</b> of one season's growth and the earlywood of the next.|$|E
2500|$|Tree {{rings are}} {{records of the}} [...] of {{environmental}} conditions, their anatomical characteristics record growth rate changes produced by these changing conditions. The microscopic structure of conifer wood consists of two types of cells: parenchyma, which have an oval or polyhedral shape with approximately identical dimensions in three directions, and strongly elongated tracheids.

5000|$|... ===Wood=== The fibrillar {{structure}} of wood {{is said to}} {{play a significant role}} in both the mechanical stability and ability of wood to possess channels to transport minerals and water. Sprucewood (Picea abies), among others, are reported to possess cellulose fibrils with a normalized diameter of 2.5 nm. There is also a reported link between the age of the wood and the spiral angle of the fibrils with respect to the longitudinal direction. Earlywood is said to have a consistent 4.6 ± 0.6° rest angle, whereas <b>latewood</b> is said to have a transition region from 4.6° to 19.8 ± 0.7°. [...] In <b>latewood,</b> the two spiral angle regions of cellulose fibrils are not continuous, meaning that there are two independent tracheid structures in “older” trees meeting different mechanical requirements. Moreover, longitudinally oriented fibrils improve tensile strength, whereas the addition of 20° tilted fibrils, exclusive to <b>latewood</b> tracheids, provides stability against compression.|$|E

50|$|Like {{trees and}} woody plants, {{perennial}} herbs have a growth zone called vascular cambium between the root bark and the root xylem. The vascular cambium ring is active during growing season and produces a new layer of xylem tissue or growth ring every year.

Each individual growth ring consists of earlywood tissue that is formed {{at the beginning of the}} growing season and <b>latewood</b> tissue formed in summer and fall. Earlywood tissue is characterized by wide vessels or denser arrangement of vessels, whereas <b>latewood</b> tissue shows narrower vessels and/or lower vessel density.|$|E

50|$|The International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB) is a data {{repository}} for tree ring measurements {{that has been}} maintained since 1990 by the United States' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Paleoclimatology Program and World Data Center for Paleoclimatology.

5000|$|It's {{difficult}} for oaks to get infected in mid summer - after July 1 - because of reduced sporulation from red oaks and summerwood cell development. Two factors changed this around on July 1, 2011: the trillions of oak wilt spores carried in from upwind and the re-opening of oaks' 2011 earlywood cells. The oak wilt fungus {{is too large}} to fit within the smaller <b>latewood</b> cells, but can move upward through the much larger earlywood cells. This increased the chances of infection to storm damaged oaks 1,000 - 1,000,000 times the usual. Instead of one new infection per 1,500 acres, foresters were seeing one new infection per 10 acres. The manageable level of oak wilt disease is one infection per 640 acres.One year after the storm, in summer 2012, oak wilt specialists found 10 - 20 infections per 100 acres both in Rushseba Township, Chisago County Minnesota and at St. Croix State Park [...] in Pine County, Minnesota. Wounding & infecting at ten oaks per 100 acres, one oak per 100 acres or one oak per 200 acres, presents {{a serious threat to}} the oak resource. St. Croix State Park's northern-most infected oak and southern-most infected oak were 10 miles apart. The only way you get that broad of coverage for infection in mid-summer is, huge spore supplies and the re-opening of that years' early wood cells.|$|E
