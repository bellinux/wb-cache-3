25|$|Valemax {{ships are}} {{a fleet of}} very large ore {{carriers}} (VLOC) owned or chartered by the Brazilian mining company Vale S.A. to carry iron ore from Brazil to European and Asian ports. With a capacity ranging from 380,000 to 400,000 tons deadweight, the vessels meet the Chinamax standard of ship measurements for limits on draft and beam. Valemax ships are the largest bulk carriers ever constructed, when measuring deadweight tonnage or <b>length</b> <b>overall,</b> and are amongst the longest ships of any type currently in service.|$|E
25|$|Barosaurus was an {{enormous}} animal, with some adults measuring more than 26meters (85feet) in length and weighing more than 20metric tons (22short tons). There are some indications of even larger individuals, probably over 50 meters long and with a mass around 100 tonnes making it possibly the largest known dinosaur. Barosaurus was differently proportioned than its close relative Diplodocus, with a longer neck and shorter tail, but {{was about the same}} <b>length</b> <b>overall.</b> It was longer than Apatosaurus, but its skeleton was less robust.|$|E
25|$|No {{measurement}} rules {{apply for}} the race. The boats are divided into different categories based {{on the length of}} the boat. There are five categories of keelboats, from mini (18–20 foot in <b>length</b> <b>overall)</b> to extra large (over 40 foot). There are two categories of multihull boats, small and large. There is a Silverrudder Challenge trophy given in each category. The fastest skipper of all times in each category is the holder of a trophy until his or her time is beaten. Each year before race start the seven trophies are collected by the organiser. After the race it is determine whether one or more Silverrudder Challenge trophies are to change hands. This happens at an award party Saturday evening or Sunday noon.|$|E

25|$|In the cytoplasm, the pre-miRNA hairpin is cleaved by the RNase III enzyme Dicer. This endoribonuclease {{interacts with}} 5' and 3' {{ends of the}} hairpin and cuts away the loop joining the 3' and 5' arms, {{yielding}} an imperfect miRNA:miRNA* duplex about 22 nucleotides in <b>length.</b> <b>Overall</b> hairpin length and loop size influence the efficiency of Dicer processing. The imperfect nature of the miRNA:miRNA* pairing also affects cleavage. Some of the G-rich pre-miRNAs can potentially adopt the G-quadruplex structure {{as an alternative to}} the canonical stem-loop structure. For example, human pre-miRNA 92b adopts a G-quadruplex structure which is resistant to the Dicer mediated cleavage in the cytoplasm. Although either strand of the duplex may potentially act as a functional miRNA, only one strand is usually incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) where the miRNA and its mRNA target interact.|$|E
