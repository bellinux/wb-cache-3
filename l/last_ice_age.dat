5|$|Mauna Kea in {{tropical}} Hawaii. There {{is evidence of}} past subglacial eruptive activity on the volcano {{in the form of}} a subglacial deposit on its summit. The eruptions originated about 10,000 years ago, during the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> <b>age,</b> when the summit of Mauna Kea was covered in ice.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the end of}} the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> <b>age,</b> small {{populations of}} arctic-alpine plants have survived in {{favourable}} spots on rock ledges high in the eastern coves. Rare to Britain species of alpine butterfly, the mountain ringlet, also live on and around Helvellyn.|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} formed during the retreat of the glaciers during the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> <b>age,</b> which {{produced}} areas of marshland, notably the Sifton Bog (which {{is actually a}} fen), {{as well as some}} of the most agriculturally productive areas of farmland in Ontario.|$|E

5|$|There is one known prehistoric {{form of the}} red-billed chough. P. p. primigenius, a {{subspecies}} {{that lived}} in Europe during the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> <b>age,</b> which was described in 1875 by Alphonse Milne-Edwards from finds in southwest France.|$|E
5|$|Until 17,800 {{years before}} present, the region {{southeast}} of Hudson {{was covered by}} the glaciers of the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> <b>age.</b> Their retreat left a series of lakes that caught tephra deposited by volcanic activity.|$|E
5|$|York {{lies in the}} Vale of York, a {{flat area}} of fertile arable land bordered by the Pennines, the North York Moors and the Yorkshire Wolds The city was built at the {{confluence}} of the Rivers Ouse and Foss on a terminal moraine left by the <b>last</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Age.</b>|$|E
50|$|Horsens {{lies at the}} end of Horsens Fjord {{in eastern}} Jutland. The city is {{surrounded}} by typical moraine landscape with low hills and valleys created by glaciers during the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> <b>ages.</b> Horsens is 50 km south of Aarhus and 30 km north of Vejle, and approximately 200 km from Copenhagen.|$|R

50|$|He also {{performed}} research in Washington State {{to understand the}} <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> <b>age’s</b> impact on the Northwest, gaining some notoriety for {{his opposition to the}} Missoula Floods hypothesis, which was posed by J Harlen Bretz. He presented a detailed and thoughtful argument against the possibility of catastrophic floods; a position which has subsequently fallen into disfavor based on a wide collection of evidence.|$|R
5|$|After the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> <b>age</b> only {{large mammals}} such as mammoths, bison and woolly {{rhinoceros}} remained. Roughly 11,000years ago, when the ice sheets began to recede, humans repopulated the area; genetic research suggests {{they came from}} {{the northern part of the}} Iberian Peninsula. The sea level was lower than now and Britain was connected by land bridge to Ireland and Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|Located in the Cleveland tri-state area, Youngstown {{is in the}} Mahoning Valley on the Glaciated Allegheny Plateau. At {{the end of the}} <b>last</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Age,</b> {{the glaciers}} left behind a uniform plain with valleys eroded by the Mahoning River {{crossing}} the plain. Lakes created by glaciers that dammed small streams were eventually drained, leaving behind fertile terrain.|$|E
5|$|The Red River Valley is {{the result}} of an ancient glacier carving its way south during the <b>last</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Age.</b> Once the glacier receded, it formed a glacial lake called Lake Agassiz. The valley is formed from the ancient lake bed. The ancient beaches can still be seen as rolling hills west of the city.|$|E
25|$|The {{plain to}} the north of Uweinat is dotted with eroded {{volcanic}} features. With the discovery of oil in the 1950s also came the discovery of a massive aquifer underneath much of Libya. The water in this aquifer pre-dates the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> <b>ages</b> and the Sahara Desert itself. This area also contains the Arkenu structures, which were once thought to be two impact craters.|$|R
25|$|The Baltic Sea {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{brackish}} inland seas by area, and occupies a basin (a zungenbecken) formed by glacial erosion during the <b>last</b> few <b>ice</b> <b>ages.</b>|$|R
5000|$|This {{more precise}} dating and {{examination}} of the salmonid whole-genome duplication event has allowed more speculation on the radiation of species within the group. Historically, the whole-genome duplication event {{was thought to be}} the reason for the variation within Salmonidae. Current evidence done with molecular clock analyses revealed that much of the speciation of the group occurred during periods of intense climate change associated with the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> <b>ages,</b> with especially-high speciation rates being observed in salmonids that developed an anadromous lifestyle.|$|R
5|$|The {{history of}} Fairbanks, the second-largest city in Alaska, {{can be traced}} to the {{founding}} of a trading post by E.T. Barnette on the south bank of the Chena River on August 26, 1901. The area had seen human occupation since at least the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> <b>age,</b> but a permanent settlement was not established at the site of Fairbanks until the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The mountainous {{terrain of}} the Chetco River {{watershed}} was created approximately 130million {{years ago when}} the microcontinent collided with the much larger North American continent. The process uplifted the complex and exotic terranes of the microcontinent to form the Klamath Mountains. Many glaciers carved U-shaped valleys and cirques during the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> <b>age,</b> and several alpine lakes still exist today.|$|E
5|$|The size of glaciers on Mount Rainier has fluctuated {{significantly}} in the past. For example, during the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> <b>age,</b> from about 25,000 to about 15,000years ago, glaciers covered most of the area now {{within the boundaries of}} Mount Rainier National Park and extended to the perimeter of the present Puget Sound Basin.|$|E
50|$|When the {{lineages}} of Borneo and Malaya diverged has {{not been}} studied; considering the phylogeny of Polyplectron, an Early Pleistocene date, roughly around 1 Ma, seems reasonable. In that regard, it is probably significant that Borneo {{was connected to the}} Southeast Asian mainland during Pleistocene glacial periods with low sea levels. In any case, the phylogeny and biogeography of the basal peacock-pheasants agrees with the idea of reproductive isolation due to rising sea levels during the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> <b>age's</b> interglacials, whereas the more advanced Polyplectron species are limited to today's mainland Southeast Asia.|$|R
5000|$|Pindar is {{situated}} {{in the midst of}} a plateau peninsula of heath and moderate dry sclerophyll forest. The south end of the peninsula ends at the Hawkesbury River. Pindar is northwest of the north shore of the Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge north of Brooklyn. To the east of the peninsula is Mullet Creek and to the west is Mooney Mooney Creek. Both Mullet and Mooney Creeks are large drowned valleys formed at the end of the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> <b>ages</b> when the waters of the world's oceans rose substantially.|$|R
50|$|Upline from Lealholm, {{the railway}} curves round the village before {{entering}} {{one of the}} deepest cuttings on the line, to pass through a giant glacial dam formed from rock pushed up the valley during the <b>last</b> great <b>ice</b> <b>age.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{volcanic}} {{rocks of}} which the mountain is made were formed in the caldera of an ancient volcano, {{many of them in}} violently explosive eruptions, about 450 million years ago during the Ordovician period. During the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> <b>age</b> these rocks were carved by glaciers to create the landforms seen today.|$|E
5|$|A relict species nearly exterminated by the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> <b>age,</b> box {{huckleberry}} is self-sterile, and {{is found}} in isolated colonies which reproduce clonally by extending roots. One colony in Pennsylvania was once estimated to {{be as many as}} 13,000 years old; more recent estimates have an upper bound of about 8,000 years, which would make it the oldest woody plant east of the Rocky Mountains. Another colony in Pennsylvania, about 1,300 years old, has been protected by the Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area.|$|E
5|$|Although {{underlain}} by {{much older}} Triassic age formations that protrude to form what would {{once have been}} islands—such as Athelney, Brent Knoll, Burrow Mump and Glastonbury Tor, which is composed of Blue Lias, the lowland landscape was formed only during the last 10,000years, {{following the end of}} the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> <b>age.</b> As the sea level changed following the Pliocene era, vegetation was laid down which was later converted into peat. The peak of the peat formation took place in swamp conditions around 6,000years ago, although in some areas it continued into medieval times.|$|E
40|$|The sigmoid and double-sigmoid {{functions}} are very useful for representing earth-states transitions in geological models. Simple hyperbolic-tangent versions are {{given for the}} functions. An example is given of fitting double-sigmoid functions to the transient state transitions of the <b>Last</b> Major <b>Ice</b> <b>Age...</b>|$|R
50|$|Like its namesake, Plainfield's {{topography}} {{is generally}} flat. Thousands of years ago, land in greater Plainfield {{used to be}} part of the bed of proglacial Lake Wauponsee. However, the lake did not hold up long, and eventually drained into the Illinois River valley. The lake left behind a very flat landscape. Much of downtown Plainfield has an above sea level elevation of around 600 - 625 ft, with some areas in the western and northwestern portions of the village's outskirts exceeding 700 ft. This rise in elevation was created by terminal moraines that were formed during the Wisconsin Episode of the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> <b>age's</b> <b>last</b> glacial period that has been recorded.|$|R
25|$|The 19th-century {{discoveries of}} a vast and {{previously}} unexpected extinct Paleogene fauna of North America, as interpreted by paleontologists Joseph Leidy, Edward Drinker Cope, and Othniel Charles Marsh, aided understanding of {{the early history of}} this family. Llamas were not always confined to South America; abundant llama-like remains were found in Pleistocene deposits in the Rocky Mountains and in Central America. Some of the fossil llamas were much larger than current forms. Some species remained in North America during the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> <b>ages.</b> North American llamas are categorized as a single extinct genus, Hemiauchenia. Llama-like animals would have been a common sight 25,000 years ago, in modern-day California, Texas, New Mexico, Utah, Missouri, and Florida.|$|R
5|$|Because of {{morphological}} similarities, the Sumatran rhinoceros {{is believed}} to be closely related to the extinct woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis). The woolly rhinoceros, so named for the coat of hair it shares with the Sumatran rhinoceros, first appeared in China; by the Upper Pleistocene, it ranged across the Eurasian continent from Korea to Spain. The woolly rhinoceros survived the <b>last</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Age,</b> but, like the woolly mammoth, most or all became extinct around 10,000 years ago. Although some morphological studies questioned the relationship, recent molecular analysis has supported the two species as sister taxa.|$|E
5|$|Because the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> <b>age</b> {{removed the}} top {{sediment}} {{layer of the}} soil, the Kola Peninsula is on the surface extremely rich in various ores and minerals, including apatites and nephelines; copper, nickel, and iron ores; mica; kyanites; ceramic materials, as well as rare-earth elements and non-ferrous ores. Deposits of construction materials such as granite, quartzite, and limestone are also abundant. Diatomaceous earth deposits are common near lakes and are used to produce insulation.|$|E
5|$|Below {{the tree}} line there are several zones of climax forest. Birch dominates {{to the west and}} north, Scots Pine with Birch and oak in the eastern Highlands and oak (both Quercus robur and Q. petrea) with Birch in the Central Lowlands and Borders. Much of the Scottish {{coastline}} consists of machair, a fertile dune pasture land formed as sea levels subsided after the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> <b>age.</b> Machairs have received considerable ecological and conservational attention, chiefly because of their unique ecosystems.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{the other}} Pribilof Islands, Saint Paul rises from a basaltic base. Its hills are {{primarily}} brown or red tufa and cinder heaps, though some (like Polavina) {{are composed of}} red scoria and breccia. [...] The island sits on {{the southern edge of}} the Bering-Chukchi platform, and may {{have been part of the}} Bering Land Bridge's southern coastline when the <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> <b>age's</b> glaciers reached their maximum expansion. Sediment core samples taken on Saint Paul show that tundra vegetation similar to that found on the island today has been present for at least 9,000 years. The thick rough turf is dominated by umbellifers (particularly Angelica) and Artemisia, though grasses and sedges are also abundant.|$|R
50|$|After {{the melting}} of the <b>last</b> great <b>ice</b> <b>age,</b> sea levels were 1-2 metres higher than today. When sea levels {{subsided}} to their current levels, fresh {{water from the}} Dandenong Ranges flowed into low-lying regions.Carrum Carrum Swamp, an extensive wetlands ecosystem was created, an area encompassing some 5000 hectares from Mordialloc to Frankston and inland towards Dandenong.|$|R
50|$|The Dubuque area {{is in the}} Driftless Area. This {{area was}} un-affected by glaciers during the <b>last</b> major <b>ice</b> <b>age.</b> Hills, Cliffs, and Valleys {{dominate}} the region. In fact, Dubuque's hills are often compared to those of San Francisco. The Mississippi River separates Iowa from Wisconsin and Illinois, though the two states can be accessed by two bridges.|$|R
