5|$|After mating, sheep have a {{gestation}} {{period of about}} five months, and normal labor takes one to three hours. Although some breeds regularly throw larger litters of <b>lambs,</b> most produce single or twin <b>lambs.</b> During or soon after labor, ewes and <b>lambs</b> may be confined to small lambing jugs, small pens designed to aid both careful observation of ewes and to cement the bond between them and their <b>lambs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} low tail dock and {{generally}} unimproved anatomy, Jacob ewes are widely {{reputed to be}} easy-lambing. Jacobs are seasonal breeders, with ewes generally cycling in the cooler months of the autumn. They will begin to cycle during the first autumn following their birth and most often the ewe's first lamb is a single. Subsequent gestations will typically bear one or two <b>lambs</b> in the spring, and triplets are not unusual. The <b>lambs</b> will exhibit their spotting and horn characteristics at birth, with the horn buds more readily apparent on ram <b>lambs.</b> <b>Lambs</b> may be weaned at two months of age, but many shepherds do not separate <b>lambs</b> and allow the ewe to wean the lamb at about 4months of age. Jacob ewes are instinctively attentive mothers and are protective of their <b>lambs.</b> They are included in commercial flocks in England because of their ease of lambing and strong mothering instincts.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes may on {{occasions}} prey on <b>lambs.</b> Usually, <b>lambs</b> {{targeted by}} foxes {{tend to be}} physically weakened specimens, but not invariably. <b>Lambs</b> belonging to small breeds, such as Blackface, are more vulnerable than larger breeds such as Merino. Twins may be more vulnerable to foxes than singlets, as ewes cannot effectively defend both simultaneously. Crossbreeding small, upland ewes with larger, lowland rams can cause difficult and prolonged labour for ewes due to the heaviness of the resulting offspring, thus making the <b>lambs</b> more at risk to fox predation. <b>Lambs</b> born from gimmers (ewes breeding for the first time) are more often killed by foxes than those of experienced mothers, who stick closer to their young.|$|E

40|$|Three key {{questions}} regarding <b>lamb</b> promotion are addressed: (1) Have industry {{efforts to promote}} <b>lamb</b> shifted out the total demand for <b>lamb?</b> (2) Have any returns to producers achieved been greater {{than the cost of}} the promotion? (3) What has been the effect of <b>lamb</b> promotion on the <b>lamb</b> import share? The first question is addressed through an econometric analysis of the U. S. retail demand for <b>lamb</b> which takes into account the effects of <b>lamb</b> advertising and promotion expenditures. The results then are used to calculate a benefit-cost ratio for <b>lamb</b> promotion in answer to the second question. An econometric analysis of the import share of U. S. <b>lamb</b> consumption provides the basis for addressing the third question. <b>Lamb</b> promotion is found to have increased the demand for <b>lamb,</b> and particularly American <b>lamb,</b> generating in the process a highly positive return to producers relative to the small cost of the program. <b>Lamb,</b> <b>Lamb</b> Promotion, <b>Lamb</b> Demand, Demand and Price Analysis, Marketing,...|$|R
5|$|In these {{countries}} {{there is little}} need, and no option but for ewes to lamb outdoors as there are insufficient structures to handle the large flocks of ewes there. New Zealand ewes produce 36 million <b>lambs</b> each spring time, which is an average of 2,250 <b>lambs</b> per farm. Australian graziers, too, do not receive the financial support that governments in other countries provide to sheep breeders. Low-cost sheep breeding is based on large numbers of sheep per labour unit and having ewes {{that are capable of}} unsupervised lambing to produce hardy, active <b>lambs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing; balancing ease of lambing with high productivity {{is one of}} the dilemmas of sheep breeding. In the case of any such problems, those present at lambing may assist the ewe by extracting or repositioning <b>lambs.</b> After the birth, ewes ideally break the amniotic sac (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb. Most <b>lambs</b> will begin standing within an hour of birth. In normal situations, <b>lambs</b> nurse after standing, receiving vital colostrum milk. <b>Lambs</b> that either fail to nurse or are rejected by the ewe require help to survive, such as bottle-feeding or fostering by another ewe.|$|E
5|$|The viable semen is then {{implanted}} in the ewe and the many <b>lambs</b> born through this process are proving to be normal and healthy. DNA tests have proved that up to 10% of the <b>lambs</b> are sired by the surrogate ram and carry the genetics of the donor ram.|$|E

5|$|In normal situations, <b>lambs</b> nurse after standing, {{receiving}} vital colostrum milk. <b>Lambs</b> {{that either}} fail to nurse or are prevented {{from doing so}} by the ewe require aid in order to live. If coaxing the pair to accept nursing does not work, one of several steps may then be taken. Ewes may be held or tied {{to force them to}} accept a nursing lamb. If a lamb is not eating, a stomach tube may also be used to force feed the lamb in order to save its life. In the case of a permanently rejected lamb, a shepherd may then attempt to foster an orphaned lamb onto another ewe. <b>Lambs</b> are also sometimes fostered after the death of their mother, either from the birth or other event.|$|E

5|$|Australian ravens die {{most often}} by being shot or poisoned—generally by farmers. Despite their fondness for roadkill, fewer ravens are hit by {{vehicles}} than Australian magpies. Research in the 1950s and 60s showed that 64% of Australian ravens perished {{in their first}} year of life. Immature birds are most at risk of dying as {{they are more likely to}} come into conflict with farmers. The Australian Raven is a peaceful bird, showing no aggression toward humans or other birds without reason. However, the Australian raven is frequently blamed for the loss of young <b>lambs.</b> Scientific observation in the country's southeast showed that the killing of healthy <b>lambs</b> was rare, but that sick animals were predisposed to being attacked. Australian ravens mostly eat faeces (often from the lamb's anus), afterbirth or stillborn <b>lambs.</b> Newborn lamb faeces is nutritious, containing around 21–44% protein, 9–37% fat and 10–30% carbohydrate. It has the consistency of treacle and often sticks to the lamb's hindquarters or tail. The raven bites a sleeping lamb's tail, holding on and walking behind it when it wakes up. A healthy lamb would respond by running away or butting the bird, but a sick one might not respond and be attacked further as it alerts the bird that it is vulnerable. Wounded <b>lambs</b> can also succumb to Clostridium infection as these bacteria are present on raven bills. Ravens bring some benefits to agricultural areas as they clean away carrion and eat insects that are potentially damaging to crops. In areas of Western Australia, the species is classified as a Declared Pest of Agriculture under the provisions of the Agriculture and Related Resources Protection Act 1976, meaning that shooting on private land in rural areas is legal, although should be considered only after other options have been exhausted.|$|E

The shepherds are astonished how a single old man can handle all the animals. Their vanity is crushed. Banai assigns him the additional responsibility {{of taking care of}} five hundred children. She commands if any sheep or lamb is lost or a child cries, she will not give him his food. But Khandoba fulfils the tasks again by spraying his bhandara.
