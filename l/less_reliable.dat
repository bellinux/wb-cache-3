5|$|Some early Christian {{groups had}} {{separate}} {{descriptions of the}} life and teachings of Jesus that {{are not included in}} the New Testament. These include the Gospels of Thomas, Peter, and Judas, the Apocryphon of James, and many other apocryphal writings. Most scholars conclude that these are written much later and are <b>less</b> <b>reliable</b> accounts than the canonical gospels.|$|E
5|$|Ptolemy, {{possibly}} {{drawing on}} earlier {{sources of information}} {{as well as more}} contemporary accounts from the Agricolan invasion, identified 18 tribes in Scotland in his Geography, but many of the names are obscure. His information becomes much <b>less</b> <b>reliable</b> in the north and west, suggesting early Roman knowledge of these area was confined to observations from the sea. Famously, his coördinates place most of Scotland north of Hadrian's Wall bent at a right angle, stretching due eastward from the rest of Britain.|$|E

5|$|The {{most popular}} kind of coral kept is soft coral, {{especially}} zoanthids and mushroom corals, which are especially {{easy to grow}} and propagate {{in a wide variety}} of conditions, because they originate in enclosed parts of reefs where water conditions vary and lighting may be <b>less</b> <b>reliable</b> and direct. More serious fishkeepers may keep small polyp stony coral, which is from open, brightly lit reef conditions and therefore much more demanding, while large polyp stony coral is a sort of compromise between the two.|$|E
5|$|While historians value {{contemporary}} skaldic poetry highly as {{the most}} accurate source available, {{it must be remembered}} that the poems are not preserved independently but as quotations in the kings' sagas. After two centuries of oral preservation, there is often doubt that a verse was accurately remembered and correctly attributed. Furthermore, skaldic poetry did not primarily aim at giving information but at artistically rendering facts already known to the hearers. Historians frequently fall back on the <b>less</b> <b>reliable</b> but more detailed accounts of the sagas.|$|E
5|$|Work on {{building}} a smaller and cheaper computer began in 1952, {{in parallel with}} Meg's ongoing development. Two of Kilburn's team, Richard Grimsdale and D. C. Webb, {{were assigned to the}} task of designing and building a machine using the newly developed transistors instead of valves. Initially the only devices available were germanium point-contact transistors, <b>less</b> <b>reliable</b> than the valves they replaced but which consumed far less power.|$|E

50|$|Bound {{by their}} {{personal}} oath to Hitler (the Reichswehreid of 1934, ironically ordered by Blomberg), {{many members of}} the Wehrmacht never acted on their feelings of displeasure regarding this event. Thereafter, the army was more or <b>less</b> a <b>reliable</b> instrument for Hitler until the 20th July plot.|$|R
5|$|Britain's {{enemies in}} {{continental}} Europe had long recognised Ireland as a weak point in Britain's defences. Landing troops {{there was a}} popular strategic goal, not only because an invader could expect {{the support of a}} large proportion of the native population, but also because at least initially they would face fewer and <b>less</b> <b>reliable</b> troops than elsewhere in the British Isles. Additionally, embroiling the British Army in a protracted Irish campaign would reduce its availability for other theatres of war. Finally, French planners considered that a successful invasion of Ireland might act as the ideal platform for a subsequent invasion of Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|It is {{recommended}} that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pituitary gland is performed if the diagnosis is suspected; this has a sensitivity of over 90% for detecting pituitary apoplexy; it may demonstrate infarction (tissue damage due to a decreased blood supply) or hemorrhage. Different MRI sequences {{can be used to}} establish when the apoplexy occurred, and the predominant form of damage (hemorrhage or infarction). If MRI is not suitable (e.g. due to claustrophobia or the presence of metal-containing implants), a computed tomography (CT) scan may demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary gland, although it is <b>less</b> <b>reliable.</b> Many pituitary tumors (25%) are found to have areas of hemorrhagic infarction on MRI scans, but apoplexy is not said to exist unless it is accompanied by symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Scholars use {{a number}} of criteria, such as the {{criterion}} of independent attestation, the criterion of coherence, and the criterion of discontinuity to judge the historicity of events. The historicity of an event also depends on {{the reliability of the}} source; indeed, the gospels are not independent nor consistent records of Jesus' life. Mark, which is most likely the earliest written gospel, has been considered for many decades the most historically accurate. John, the latest written gospel, differs considerably from the Synoptic Gospels, and thus is generally considered <b>less</b> <b>reliable,</b> although more and more scholars now also recognize that it may contain a core of older material as historically valuable as the Synoptic tradition or even more so.|$|E

40|$|The {{variety of}} {{evidence}} thesis in confirmation theory states that more varied supporting evidence confirms a hypothesis {{to a greater}} degree than less varied evidence. Under a very plausible interpretation of this thesis, positive test results from multiple independent instruments confirm a hypothesis {{to a greater degree}} than positive test results from a single instrument. We invoke Bayesian Networks to model confirmation on grounds of evidence that is obtained from <b>less</b> than fully <b>reliable</b> instruments and show that the variety of evidence thesis is not sacrosanct when testing is conducted with <b>less</b> than fully <b>reliable</b> instruments: under certain conditions, a hypothesis receives more confirmation from evidence that is obtained from one rather than from more independent instruments. In the appendix, we prove certain convergence results for large numbers of positive test results from single versus multiple <b>less</b> than fully <b>reliable</b> instruments...|$|R
50|$|Bullet and gun {{analysis}} is another forensic test {{that has been}} identified in recent studies as being <b>less</b> scientifically <b>reliable</b> than thought.

5|$|That hops {{could be}} used for {{flavoring}} beer had been known at least since Carolingian times, but was adopted gradually due to difficulties in establishing the appropriate proportions. Before the widespread use of hops, gruit, a mix of various herbs, had been used. Gruit had the same preserving properties as hops, though <b>less</b> <b>reliable</b> depending on what herbs were in it, and the end result was much more variable. Another flavoring method was to increase the alcohol content, but this was more expensive and lent the beer the undesired characteristic of being a quick and heavy intoxicant. Hops may have been widely used in England in the tenth century; they were grown in Austria by 1208 and in Finland by 1249, and possibly much earlier.|$|E
5|$|The Revolutionary War forced William and Mary {{to close}} in 1781, as its {{buildings}} were used as barracks for British, French, and American troops as each nation successively controlled the college and surrounding area. Although William C. Davis records that Breckinridge had previously served as an ensign in the Botetourt County militia, Harrison notes that the most reliable records of Virginians' military service do not indicate his participation in the Revolutionary War, but <b>less</b> <b>reliable</b> sources mention him as a subaltern in the Virginia militia. If he enlisted, Harrison speculates that he served {{in one or two}} short 1780 militia campaigns supporting Nathanael Greene's army in southwest Virginia.|$|E
5|$|In March 1940, Milford was {{assigned}} to the newly formed 7th Division as commander of the division's artillery, {{one of a number of}} officers from the Staff Corps appointed to the division. He traveled to the Middle East in October but was destined to spend only a few weeks in his position before being recalled to Australia in January 1941 to take up the post of master-general of the ordnance. He was also promoted to temporary major general, the first Duntroon graduate to reach the rank of general. In his new appointment, he was tasked with co-ordination of private and government manufacturers and producers to provide logistic support for Australia's soldiers, both at home and overseas. He was also involved with a committee investigating the supply requirements of each of the services and the available resources, as well as the development of new weapons. When the Owen gun, an Australian designed and manufactured submachine gun, was brought to his attention, he initially favoured the use of the Sten, even though it proved to be <b>less</b> <b>reliable</b> than the Owen.|$|E

50|$|Early {{settlers}} in Phoenix and nearby areas {{were forced to}} rely on the flow of the Salt River to sustain agricultural activities. The river was prone to both floods and droughts and proved to be a <b>less</b> than <b>reliable</b> resource for the settlers. Failed plans to build a dam on the river in 1897, combined with a series of droughts, heightened the need for controlling the river.|$|R

5|$|Poling took severe {{punishment}} {{from very}} accurate bombing. Since Ventnor radar station had been knocked out already, this attack demonstrated that {{an attack on}} Fighter Command's command, communication and control system was possible. Emergency equipment had been installed on the site {{in case of a}} breakdown, but the information and reading of the radar was significantly <b>less</b> <b>reliable.</b> In fact, Poling was so badly damaged it was out of action for the rest of August. Fortunately, the CH chain had a mobile radar station at the Isle of Wight to fill in for it. Another was due to be set up near Poling anyway, so the chain remained unaffected. The damage done to Kenley and Poling were no more than inconveniences to Park and Dowding. Only one WAAF member, Avis Parsons, was studying the plots at Poling up until the attack. She was awarded the Military Medal for her actions on 5 September 1940.|$|E
5|$|The Pondicherry shark {{appears to}} have been broadly {{distributed}} in the Indo-Pacific. It may have once been common, as it was reportedly a regular catch off India and Pakistan, but is now extremely rare. Most of the known specimens were collected from India, with more specimens from the Gulf of Oman, Borneo, and Java. There are also <b>less</b> <b>reliable</b> records from the South China Sea, other parts of Southeast Asia such as Vietnam and the Philippines, New Guinea, and northern Australia. This species inhabits inshore waters. Several older sources reported that it could be found in rivers such as the Hooghli River and the Saigon River. These reports may have confused a river shark (Glyphis sp.) for the Pondicherry shark; if accurate, they would suggest this species to be tolerant of low salinity. As of 2016, these reports have been confirmed; the only documented Pondicherry sharks in the 21st century were found in the Sri Lankan Menik River.|$|E
5|$|His view (part of a {{tradition}} {{that goes back to}} J. J. Müller, who advanced Marius' claims as early as 1870, and supported by modern scholars such as André Chastagnol) was vigorously contested by Ronald Syme, who theorized that virtually all the identifiable citations from Marius Maximus are essentially frivolous interpolations into the main narrative source, which he postulated was a different Latin author whom he styled 'Ignotus ("the unknown one"), the good biographer'. His theory argued, firstly, that as Marius wrote a sequel to the Lives of the Twelve Caesars, his work covered the reigns from Nerva to Elagabalus; consequently, this would not have included a biography of Lucius Verus, even though the biography of that Princeps in the History is mainly of good quality. Secondly, that 'Ignotus' only went up to Caracalla, as is revealed by the inferior and mostly fictitious biography of Macrinus. Finally, that the composer of the Historia Augusta wrote the lives of the emperors through to the Life of Caracalla (including Lucius Verus) using Ignotus as his main source, and supplementing with Marius Maximus on occasion. It was only when the source failed that he turned to other <b>less</b> <b>reliable</b> sources (such as Herodian and Maximus), as well as his own fertile imagination, and it was at this juncture that he composed the first five minor lives, through to the Life of Geta.|$|E
