This architecture provides the maximum possible rate of the computational process. The algorithm is based on a sliding window method applied to bottlenecks - fragments of program code taking a maximum percentage of time for execution.

Calculation of the rational number for arithmetic and logical channels of processor architecture is performed on the code example that implements the algorithm for calculating the tesseral harmonics of the Earth gravitational field.

Among these standards, TM Space Data Link protocol is a data communication and transmission protocol, which is mainly used in packet telemetry system to transmit packet telemetry data from space to ground[3][4]. In order to better transmit those information, virtual channels scheduling mechanism is widely used in packet telemetry system. Virtual Channels are a group of <b>logic</b> <b>channels</b> formed by dividing the physical channel by time slots. Each virtual channel transmits the packets information with the same or similar service demands, and the physical channel is shared by all these virtual channels. The algorithm used in virtual channels mechanism, namely, virtual channels scheduling algorithm, determines the sequence of occupying the physical channel by each virtual channel, which has a great effect on the transmission efficiency. In this paper, we study the virtual channels scheduling algorithm based on priority in packet telemetry system, and find an interesting conclusion: when the running time of the scheduling module is long enough, for the VC with the highest priority, both the probability of occupying the physical (namely, the VC with the highest priority is scheduled) and the packetslosing rate converge on fixed values, which can provide reference for engineering design...|$|E

They have enabled the establishment of mechanical and liquid circuits with complexity similar to integrated electrical circuits. However, while the microfluidic chips have been miniaturized, their external governing systems have remained unchanged. This lack of embedded control transforms the small chip into a large and often cumbersome system. Next generation of microfluidic systems will allow reduction or removal of these controllers. Various successful microfluidics for reduction of these external requirements has been demonstrated.

40|$|Abstract – Cloud {{computing}} means {{using multiple}} server computers via a digital network {{as though they}} were one computer. Often, the services available is considered part of cloud computing. Cloud computing broadens the range of applications offered to mobile end-users with demanding applications in terms of graphical hardware, such as 3 D virtual environments, or storage capacity, such as 3 D medical imaging applications. As the cloud infrastructure is shared among multiple users, these hardware resources can be provided in a cost-effective way. Mobile cloud computing can give mobile device users a number of advantages. Company users are able to share resources and applications without a high level of capital expenditure on hardware and software resources. Mobile cloud computing provides a solution to meet the increasing functionality demands of end-users, as all application logic is executed on distant servers and only user interface functionalities reside on the mobile device. The mobile device acts as a remote display, capturing user input and rendering the display updates received from the distant server. Essentially, the principle of mobile cloud computing physically separates the user interface from the application <b>logic.</b> Varying wireless <b>channel</b> conditions, short battery lifetime and interaction latency introduce major challenges for the remote display of cloud applications on mobile devices.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to a traditional setting where users express queries against the database schema, we assert that the semantics of data can often be understood by viewing the data {{in the context of}} the user interface (UI) of the software tool used to enter the data. That is, we believe that users will understand the data in a database by seeing the labels, dropdown menus, tool tips, help text, control contents, and juxtaposition or arrangement of controls that are built in to the user interface. Our goal is to allow domain experts with little technical skill to understand and query data. In this dissertation, we present our GUi As View (Guava) framework and describe how we use forms-based UIs to generate a conceptual model that represents the information in the user interface. We then describe how we generate a query interface from the conceptual model. We characterize the resulting query language using a subset of relational algebra. Since most application developers want to craft a physical database to meet desired performance needs independent of the schema used by the user interface, we subsequently present a general-purpose schema mapping tool called a channel that can be configured by instantiating a sequence of discrete transformations. Each transformation is an encapsulation of a physical design decision or business <b>logic</b> process. The <b>channel,</b> once configured, automatically transforms queries from our query interface into queries that address the underlying physical database, similar to a view.

SWL systems use Sigma-Delta Modulation (SDM) technique to express an analogue or multi-bit input signal {{in terms of}} a high frequency single-bit stream. In Sigma-Delta Modulation, the input signal is coarsely quantized into a single-bit representation by sampling it at a much higher rate than twice the maximum input frequency viz. the Nyquist rate. This single-bit representation is almost exclusively filtered to remove conversion quantization noise and sample decimated to the Nyquist frequency in preparation for traditional signal processing. SWL algorithms have a huge potential in a variety of applications as they offer many advantages as compared to multi-bit approaches. Features of SWL include efficient hardware implementation, increased flexibility and massive cost savings. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are SRAM/FLASH based integrated circuits that can be programmed and re-programmed by the end user. FPGAs are made up of arrays of <b>logic</b> gates, routing <b>channels</b> and I/O blocks. State-of-the-art FPGAs include features such as Advanced Clock Management, Dedicated Multipliers, DSP Slices, High Speed I/O and Embedded Microprocessors.

30|$|In {{addition}} to responding to Weber’s thesis, {{the results of}} this section also challenged previous research regarding donations from the economic perspective. Previous studies often associate anonymous donations with whether there is an expectation of interests return from donations (Bishop and Green 2011; Wilson 2000). Donations open to the public or rewarded in return are classified as donations expecting benefits. Anonymous donations and those not rewarded are classified as donations not expecting benefits. The former’s motivation belongs to the pursuit of self-interest, and the latter seems to be more generous and selfless. However, the reality is not necessarily so. First, we have verified the same strain of <b>logic</b> behind donation <b>channels,</b> openness to the public, and incentives. The different paths that lead to donations are driven by the interest groups that business owners belong to, and thus, we cannot say who does not really care about interests. Although anonymous and without government incentives, the susceptible interests of religious believers are obtained through religious experiences conferred by donating (Bourdieu 1984) and are no less than the spiritual enjoyment given by the government to business owners who are party members. Secondly, today’s era, especially in terms of donations from business philanthropists, is different from previous traditional times dominated by small-scale individual donations. When business owners see donation as a responsibility, they “tend to focus on the results of donations, or the impact of donations” (Bishop and Green 2011, 36), that is, they are concerned about what happens to those who receive the donations and whether the donations help to solve major social problems. This inevitably leads to disclosure of donations. In comparison, “donations driven by religion are concerned only about what donations can bring to the donor rather than those being donated” (Bishop and Green 2011, 36). This makes donors instinctively not care about disclosure of donation information and choose to remain anonymous because subconsciously they have already met their goal to carry out their wishes or have communicated with God in their heart. Again, making donations public or not, or being rewarded or not also depends on the donor’s institutional environment, as was discussed previously.|$|R
40|$|Deployment of Dynamic Differential Logics (DDL) {{appears to}} be a {{promising}} choice for providing resistance against leakage of side channel information. However, the resistance provided by these logics is too costly for widespread area-constrained applications. Implementation of a secure DDL-based countermeasure also requires a complex layout methodology for balancing the load at the differential outputs. This thesis, unlike previous logic level approaches, presents a novel exploitation of static and single-ended logic for designing the side channel countermeasure. The proposed technique is used in the implementation of a protected crypto core consisting of the AES “AddRoundKey” and “SubByte” transformation. The test chip including the protected and unprotected crypto cores is fabricated in 180 nm CMOS technology. A correlation analysis on the unprotected core results in revealing the key at the output of the combinational networks and the registers. The quality of the measurements is further improved by introducing an enhanced data capturing method that inserts a minimum power consuming input as a reference vector. In comparison, no key-related information is leaked from the protected core even with an order of magnitude {{increase in the number of}} averaged traces. For the first time, fabricated chip results are used to validate a new <b>logic</b> level side <b>channel</b> countermeasure that offers lower area and reduced circuit design complexity compared to the DDL-based countermeasures. This thesis also provides insight into the side channel vulnerability of cryptosystems in sub- 90 nm CMOS technology nodes. In particular, data dependency of leakage power is analyzed. The number of traces to disclose the key is seen to decrease by 35 % from 90 nm to 45 nm CMOS technology nodes. Analysis shows that the temperature dependency of the subthreshold leakage has an important role in increasing the ability to attack future nanoscale crypto cores. For the first time, the effectiveness of a circuit-based leakage reduction technique is examined for side channel security. This investigation demonstrates that high threshold voltage transistor assignment improves resistance against information leakage. The analysis initiated in this thesis is crucial for rolling out the guidelines of side channel security for the next generation of Cryptosystem. 1 yea...|$|R
