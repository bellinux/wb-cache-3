40|$|Agreement of {{theoretical}} calculations with the observed production rate of bottom quarks at hadron colliders is improved by {{the introduction of}} a contribution from pair-production of light gluinos, of mass 12 to 16 GeV, having two-body decays into bottom quarks and <b>light</b> <b>bottom</b> squarks with mass ≃ 2 to 5. 5 GeV. Predictions are made for hadronic and radiative decays of the Upsilon states. In the limit of large tan β, the dominant decay mode of the light scalar Higgs boson is into a pair of <b>light</b> <b>bottom</b> squarks that materialize as jets of hadrons. 1...|$|E

40|$|The authors address known {{discrepancies}} between the heavy flavor properties of jets produced at the Tevatron collider and {{the prediction of}} conventional-QCD simulations. In this study, they entertain the possibility that these effects are real and due to new physics. They show that all anomalies can be simultaneously fitted by postulating the additional pair production of <b>light</b> <b>bottom</b> squarks with a 100 % semileptonic branching fraction...|$|E

This is alleviated by a light gluino, which is however only marginally experimentally allowed...|$|E

The <b>lightest</b> <b>bottom</b> and top squarks (tildeb_ 1 and t̃_ 1 respectively) are searched for in a final state with large missing transverse momentum and two jets identified as originating from b-quarks.
