5|$|Bryce Dallas Howard (born March 2, 1981) is an American film actress, director, producer, and writer. Howard {{attended}} New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, {{but left}} before graduating {{to take on}} roles on Broadway. During a performance of As You <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> where Howard portrayed Rosalind, she {{caught the attention of}} director M. Night Shyamalan, and he cast her in what would be her breakout film, the psychological thriller The Village (2004) and then in the fantasy thriller Lady in the Water (2006). Her performance in Kenneth Branagh’s film adaptation of As You <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> (2006) earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination. In 2006 she co-wrote and directed the short film Orchids.|$|E

5000|$|A cartoon by Helen E. Hokinson of The New Yorker on {{the back}} cover of Fanny Butcher's {{autobiography}} Many Lives, One Love shows a bookstore clerk showing a book to an elderly lady. The clerk is saying, [...] "Hugh Walpole <b>liked</b> <b>it,</b> Fanny Butcher <b>liked</b> <b>it,</b> Wm. Rose Benet <b>liked</b> <b>it,</b> and Mrs. Roosevelt <b>liked</b> <b>it,</b> but it *isn't* very good." [...] (drawing copyright 1940 and 1968 by The New Yorker Magazine). This shows that Fanny Butcher was a household name among bookish Americans in 1940.|$|R

5|$|The overall {{theme of}} the song puts me {{in the mind of}} a hit from R group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 that was also titled Poison, but doesn't fair the {{potential}} to be a number one song <b>like</b> <b>it</b> did close to 20 years ago. Even though the song doesn't seem <b>like</b> <b>it</b> would be a chart topper it does seem album worthy. It's something most can relate to if you've ever been in a relationship. Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's no good, but yet is so hard to walk away from and ends up being just like Poison.|$|E

5|$|After {{appearing}} in Bus Stop (1956), Monroe founded her own production company, Marilyn Monroe Productions, in 1955; the company produced one film independently, The Prince and the Showgirl (1957). Monroe then appeared in Some <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> Hot (1959) and The Misfits (1961). She was {{suspended from the}} filming of Something's Got to Give in June 1962, and the film remained uncompleted when she died in August. Although she was a top-billed actress for only a decade, her films grossed $200 million {{by the time of}} her unexpected death in 1962.|$|E

5000|$|Stan Lee told Kenneth Plume on a June 26, 2000 interview, [...] "The Hulk {{was done}} intelligently. It {{was done by}} Ken Johnson, who's a {{brilliant}} writer/producer/director, and he made it an intelligent, adult show that kids could enjoy. He took a comic book character and made him somewhat plausible. Women <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> and men <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> and teenagers <b>liked</b> <b>it...</b> It was beautifully done. He changed it quite a bit from the comic book, but every change he made, made sense." ...|$|R
6000|$|These {{questions}} were not informed with earnestness, but Strether saw he must none the less {{make a choice}} and take a line. [...] "Because, you see, I've greatly <b>liked</b> <b>it.</b> I've <b>liked</b> my Paris, I dare say I've <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> too much." ...|$|R
5|$|Although {{historically}} unsubstantiated, {{the story}} of how Zoroastrians gained permission to step on the shores of Gujarat continues to be critical to the self-identity of the group. Per the commonly told narrative, the Rajah of Sanjan, summoned them and demanded to know how they wouldn't be a burden on or a threat to the indigenous communities. Replying to their request of practising their religion and till the land, he showed them a jug full of milk, saying Sanjan <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was full. In one version, a dastur added a coin to the milk, saying like the coin, no one would be able to see that they were there but they would enrich the milk nonetheless. In another version, he added sugar instead and claimed that <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> they would sweeten lands of Sanjan. In both of them their settlement is approved by the Rajah who addresses certain conditions for it: they would explain their religion, promise not to prosletyize, adopt Gujarati speech and dress, surrender their weapons and only conduct their rituals after nightfall.|$|E

The {{music on the}} album covers Chapters 1 to 3. According to Suzuki, {{this was due to}} the music feeling <b>like</b> <b>it</b> had reached a natural transition point by that stage of the game.|$|E
5|$|At most 600,000 years old, Kīlauea {{is still}} quite young for a Hawaiian volcano; the oldest volcano on the island, the northwestern Kohala, {{experienced}} almost 900,000 years of activity before going extinct. The volcano's foreseeable future activity {{will likely be}} much <b>like</b> <b>it</b> {{has been for the}} past 50,000 to 100,000 years; Hawaiian and explosive activity will continue to heighten Kīlauea's summit, build up its rift zones, and fill and refill its summit caldera.|$|E
5000|$|Crow {{states the}} {{inspiration}} for the song came from one of her father's sayings: [...] "My dad always said, ‘Drive <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>it’s</b> stolen, and park <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>it’s</b> rented.’ And I thought, that’s how you have to live life. So I’ve always wanted to write a song with that idea in it".|$|R

5|$|Bastei Verlag, enamoured by {{the success}} of Bessy, asked Vandersteen to provide a second weekly series. With the {{popularity}} of superheroes, especially Batman, in Belgium and Germpany in these years, Vandersteen proposed a spinoff series of Suske en Wiske, based on Jerom, the strongman of the series. Called Wastl in German, 173 stories were produced between 1968 and 1972, with a publication that reached 150,000 copies at its summit. The best of these stories were published in Dutch as well, just <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was done with the later Bessys, but the weakness of the stories ended the series after only four years.|$|E
5|$|Borrowing {{from the}} French again, Planché {{introduced}} the revue (or review) to British theatre, as {{a commentary on}} recent events, particularly events in the theatre. His first revue, Success; or, a hit if you <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> was produced in 1825. He wrote another seven over the next 30 years, a peak of four in the years 1853–1855.|$|E
5|$|Extant strepsirrhines have an epitheliochorial placenta, {{where the}} {{maternal}} blood {{does not come}} {{in direct contact with}} the fetal chorion <b>like</b> <b>it</b> does in the hemochorial placenta of haplorhines. The strepsirrhine uterus has two distinct chambers (bicornuate). Despite having similar gestation periods to comparably sized haplorhines, fetal growth rates are generally slower in strepsirrhines, which results in newborn offspring that are as little as one-third the size of haplorhine newborns. Extant strepsirrhines also have a lower basal metabolic rate, which elevates in females during gestation, putting greater demands on the mother.|$|E

5|$|For several years, Howard {{appeared}} in New York plays. Among these were House & Garden, a 2002 Alan Ayckbourn production {{held at the}} Manhattan Theatre Club, in which she portrayed a disdainful, flirtatious teen. While performing as Rosalind in the critically acclaimed 2003 William Shakespeare comedy production As You <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> at The Public Theater, Howard {{caught the eye of}} director M.

5|$|I {{was told}} by my {{publishers}} that Cher heard my version and she doesn't like my new lyrics. She thinks it's too overtly sexual. But the original writers were happy {{for me to do}} that—Cher didn't actually write it so she didn't get approval about what happened to the song. Now apparently she's heard what I've done and she doesn't <b>like</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|In June 1944, Kenney was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} Far East Air Forces (FEAF), which came to include the Fifth, Thirteenth, and Seventh Air Forces. He created the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Air Task Forces to control air operations in forward areas, each for a specific mission, another departure from doctrine. While Kenney was enthusiastic about this innovation, Washington did not <b>like</b> <b>it</b> and, over Kenney's objections, converted the three air task forces into the 308th, 309th and 310th Bombardment Wings. He was promoted to general on 9 March 1945.|$|E

5|$|In the aye-aye, the sublingua is not {{shaped like}} a brush <b>like</b> <b>it</b> is in most lemurs. Instead, there is a {{thickened}} area along the plica mediana or lytta which has a hook-shaped structure on the end. Within cheirogaleids, the sublingua lacks cartilage, and the sublingua of the gray mouse lemur has a distinct plica mediana and ends in two lobe-like projections that lack keratinized serrations, but have three keratinized ridges which make the sublingua rigid.|$|E
5|$|It was {{a little}} strange. And {{definitely}} when I {{walked down the aisle}} I was like, 'This is kind of creepy — there’s some other man standing there!' It was really beautiful.

But I think it’s just one of those moments that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E
5|$|Jack is {{concerned}} for his mother, Colleen (Elaine Stritch). He tells Liz that {{the anniversary of}} his father, Jimmy Donaghy, abandoning their family is coming up and he is afraid of the effect it will have on Colleen. When Jack arrives at Colleen's hotel room {{to take her to}} dinner, however, he discovers she is staying with a man, Paul. Jack, worried she has been taken in by a con man in her time of grief, asks his private investigator Lenny Wosniak (Steve Buscemi) to look into Paul. Wosniak cannot find anything distasteful in Paul's background, but tells Jack that he is married. Jack reveals this to his mother, but she says she knew and did not care. Colleen is also surprised that Jack thought the anniversary of Jimmy leaving would hurt her, noting that he had once left from the spring of 1957 until he came back and invited her to see Some <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> Hot. Jack talks this over with Liz and comes to realize that as Some <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> Hot was released in 1959, Jimmy Donaghy cannot have been his biological father because Jack was conceived in 1958, during the period Jimmy had been absent.|$|E
