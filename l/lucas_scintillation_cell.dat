The 222 Rn gradually builds up and attain secular equilibrium with its parent 226 Ra. This gives a steady count after a suitable buildup period (> 25 days). This secondary source {{was used to}} calibrate the radon counting system. The method is validated in by comparison with identical measurement with AlphaGuard Aquakit. The radon counting system {{was used to evaluate}} dissolved radon in ground water sample by gross alpha counting in LC.

AlphaGuard measures dissolved radon from water sample by constant aeration in a closed circuit without giving any delay. Both the methods are matching with a correlation coefficient of > 0. 9. This validates the calibration of <b>Lucas</b> <b>scintillation</b> <b>cell</b> counting system by designed encapsulated source.

40|$|Objectives: Geothermal waters {{may contain}} soluble, {{radioactive}} radon gas.

It has been necessary to assess the exposure to radon among people: workers and visitors of spa centers that use geothermal waters.

The measurements were performed by active dosimetry using <b>Lucas</b> <b>scintillation</b> <b>cells.</b> Results: According to our research, the doses received by the personnel in Polish geothermal spas are < 0. 6 mSv/year.

40|$|Because of {{the change}} in path-length of the alpha {{particle}} as a function of air density, it has long been suspected that <b>scintillation</b> <b>cells</b> would have different counting efficiencies at different air densities (elevations), where counting efficiency is here defined as that fraction of radiation produced within the cell that is actually counted. However, except for a few isolated examples (George, 1983; Eberline, 1987), no literature has been found which examines this phenomenon in a general way. This paper presents a theoretical model which predicts this change in counting efficiency as a function of air density and cell geometry and reports on several attempts to quantify this change experimentally. Among the various cylindrical <b>scintillation</b> <b>cells</b> commonly available, it is predicted that the counting efficiency of <b>scintillation</b> <b>cells</b> at higher elevations (6000 feet (1969 m) or 820 millibar) increases (compared to lower elevations of 820 feet (266 m) or 990 millibar) as the size of the cell increases until a certain geometry is reached, peaking at around a 10 % increase for a cell with a diameter of approximately 7 cm and a length of approximately 9. 7 cm. The counting efficiency at higher elevations (compared to lower elevations) then drops off for cells larger than this, apparently approaching a modest 1. 3 % increase for cells ten times larger. Finally, it is suggested that these errors are sufficiently large enough so that they have to be corrected for under the current methodology used in inter-comparisons between commercial chambers and the U. S. EPA facility in Las Vegas...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} water {{molecules}} on the electrostatic collection of (218) Po ions {{onto the surface}} of silicon detectors (neutralization) is evaluated through the comparison with a <b>scintillation</b> <b>cell</b> (ZnS), not affected by air humidity. A radon monitor (RAD 7, Durridge Company) was connected to a stainless steel radon chamber, equipped with the <b>scintillation</b> <b>cell.</b> Radon gas, extracted from an acidified RaCl 2 source, was injected into the chamber and the amount of water molecules in the system was alternatively lowered or increased (from 0. 00075 to 0. 014  g of water in RAD 7) by connecting the chamber to a desiccant or to a bubbling water bottle. The relative efficiency of the silicon detector with respect to the <b>scintillation</b> <b>cell</b> decreases with the growth of water molecules inside RAD 7. This dependence, with a fixed i) electrostatic chamber geometry and ii) nominal high voltage, diverges during the humidification or the drying phase because it is in turn influenced by the length of interaction of polonium atoms with water molecules, which impacts on the size of (218) Po clusters and thus on the neutralization process. For water contents higher that 0. 01  g in RAD 7, this effect is greatly enhanced. Temperature in the investigated range (18. 5 - 35. 6  °C) does not affect the efficiency of electrostatic collection-based silicon detectors. Based on these experiments, admitting a certain error on the efficiency (from 1. 8 to 7. 5 %, depending on the water content), proper corrections were developed to adjust soil radon readings, when a desiccant is removed. This operation is necessary if recent Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids (NAPLs) leakage has occurred in the subsoil to avoid the sorption and possible later release of radon by Drierite, with related partition between the solid and liquid phases (water and NAPL) ...|$|R

The main contributors to natural radiation are high-energy cosmic radiation and radioactive nuclides that {{originate in the}} earth’s crust. 222 Rn, a decay product of 226 Ra, originates from the naturally occurring 238 U decay series. 222 Rn, the only gas in the 238 U decay series, is chemically inert, but is radioactive and exposure to it and its decay products constitutes about half the radiation dose received by general population. The quantity of radon that escapes from the earth depends mainly on the concentration of radium in the soil along with other factors, like the type of the soil cover, porosity, etc. With this in mind, a systematic study of radionuclide in samples of soil, rocks and water and also in ambient air was measured at about 500 locations in Mysore City, India.

In this research various types and thicknesses of geomembranes were evaluated in order to determine which geomembranes could be used as suitable barriers for radon. ^ The permeation of radioactive gases through geomembranes cannot be measured using the method described by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). The ASTM method estimates the permeation of a single pure gas through a polymeric membrane. The radioactivity of radon would be very high if this method was used. The method developed in this study utilized radon permeation <b>scintillation</b> <b>cell</b> which consisted of a source chamber, a measuring chamber, a radium source, and a geomembrane specimen. The concentration of radon within the source chamber and the measuring chamber was quantified by counting the alpha particles emitted by the decay of radon and its daughters. Based on the percentage of radon permeation through the membranes (defined as the reduction factor), the permeance was calculated. ^ The data indicated that 0. 8 -mm thick geomembranes such as chlorinated polyethylene, polyurethane and ethylene interpolymer alloy provided a permeance that was less than 500 fmol m- 2 s- 1 Pa- 1. These geomembranes are suitable barriers for radon. The permeance of 0. 15 -mm polyethylene sheet, which {{has been used as a}} radon barrier, is 1. 47 × 104 fmol m- 2 s- 1 Pa- 1. ^ The effect of certain parameters on radon permeation was quantitatively studied. Such parameters included the difference in air pressure between the two sides of a geomembrane, the thickness of the geomembrane, and the temperature. It was found that a difference of 5 cm Hg in air pressure between the two sides of a geomembrane did not significantly influence the radon permeation. Radon permeation decreased exponentially with increasing thickness of the geomembranes. Radon permeation increased according to an exponential function as the temperature increased. The values measured for the activation energy for the permeation of radon through different geomembranes were between 26 and 110 kJ mol- 1. In studies of the effect of temperature on radon permeation our results showed that the values of the activation energies and the pre-exponential factors measured for radon through a wide range of geomembranes gave very good linear plots of the activation energies and the logarithm of the pre-exponential factors. This relationship implies that a general mechanism of permeation is utilized in all geomembranes studied, differing only in magnitude. ...|$|R
40|$|Adhesion of osteogenic cells on {{biomaterials}} can {{be studied}} with static in vitro models, whereas models representing dynamic seeding conditions are rare. Herein, we present an in vitro model to study cell adhesion on granular biomaterials under dynamic seeding conditions. Radiolabeled osteogenic MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells were allowed to adhere to granules of natural bovine bone mineral (NBM) under constant rotation. Adhesion of MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells was determined by liquid <b>scintillation</b> counting, and <b>cell</b> morphology was visualized by scanning electron microscopy. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay under static and dynamic conditions, at room and body temperature, and in {{the presence or absence}} of serum. We show here that MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells rapidly adhere to NBM, reaching a peak 3 h after seeding. Attached cells display characteristic signs of spreading. Five to ten percent of total radioactivity remained on NBM after the removal of nonadherent cells. Viability is maintained at room temperature and under rotation for upto 3 h. This data suggests that the dynamic in vitro model presented here provides a tool to study cell adhesion on granular biomaterial...|$|R
40|$|Functional human GABAB(1 a, 2) and GABAB(1 b, 2) receptors {{have been}} stably {{expressed}} in mammalian CHO K 1 cells. Detailed characterization of GABAB ligand binding {{at each of}} the receptors has been compared using [3 H]-CGP 54626 A. In cell membranes fractions, [3 H]-CGP 54626 A bound to a single site with a KD of 1. 51 ± 1. 12 [*]nM, Bmax of 2. 02 ± 0. 17 [*]pmoles mg protein− 1 and 0. 86 ± 0. 20 [*]nM, Bmax of 5. 19 ± 0. 57 [*]pmoles mg protein− 1 for GABAB(1 a, 2) and GABAB(1 b, 2) respectively. In competition binding assays the rank order was identical for both GABAB receptors. For known GABAB agonists the rank order was CGP 27492 >SKF 97541 =CGP 46381 >GABA>Baclofen and for GABAB antagonists the rank order was CGP 54262 A>CGP 55845 >CGP 52432 >SCH 50911 >CGP 51176 >CGP 36742 =CGP 35348 ⩾ 2 -OH Saclofen ⩾ABPA. The allosteric effect of calcium cations was also investigated. The effect of removal of CaCl 2 from the binding assay conditions was ligand dependent to either cause a decrease in ligand affinity or to have no significant effect. However, these effects were similar for both GABAB receptors. A whole <b>cell,</b> <b>scintillation</b> proximity binding assay was used to determine agonist affinity at exclusively heterodimeric GABAB receptors. In competition assays, the rank order was the same for both GABAB(1 a, 2) and GABAB(1 b, 2) and consistent with that seen with cell membrane fractions. These data suggest that, in terms of ligand binding, the currently identified isoforms of the GABAB receptor are pharmacologically indistinguishable...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT-The aim of {{the study}} was to {{establish}} enzyme-deficient mutants of the human permanent cell line U- 937. Follow-ing chemical mutagenesis with the use of ethyl methanesulfonate, this cell line was chronically exposed to increasing concentrations of the toxic hypoxanthine analogue 6 -thioguanine. Cells surviving hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine selective media were sepa-rated by glass adherence with the use of 12 - 0 -tetradecanoyl-phorbol- 13 -acetate. Three mutant clones were established, which have remained hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) deficient for a period of 7 months, as shown by indirect measure-ments with the use of autoradiography and <b>scintillation</b> counting of <b>cells</b> exposed to [3 H]hypoxanthine. Since the phenotypic prop-erties and growth behavior of U- 937 cells have remained unaltered after the induced mutation, a highly restricted chromosomal seg-ment coding for HPRT seems to have been mutated. -JNCI 1986; 76 : 201 - 206. Hybridoma technology has made it possible to im-mortalize cell populations with certain functional prop-erties. For blood cells such hybridomas are widely avail-able from B-lymphocytes (1) for the production of monoclonal antibodies. Another important functional activity of blood cells is the secretion of immunologically active mediators oper-ating in intercellular communication and in the regula-tion of cellular activities. These factors, currently referred to as "interleukins " or "lymphokines, " have been mainly attributed to monocytes (2) and certain T-lymphocyte subpopulations (3). One of the major prerequisites for establishment of selected hybridoma clones is the availability of a paren-tal line deficient in thymidine kinase or HPR T (EC 2. 4. 2. 8) to maintain sensitivity to selective media, such as those containing HAT. Whereas enzyme-deficient mutants of permanent T-cell lines as one parent for T-cell hybrids are already available (4), a comparable mutant line is still lacking for the generation of mono-cyte hybrids. In the present study we describe the suc-cessful establishment of 3 HPR T-deficient clones of the human histiocytic cell line U- 937 (5); these clones are appropriate for the production of intralineage human monocyte hybrids...|$|R
40|$|Bis(5 -amidino- 2 -benzimidazolyl) methane (BABIM) is a {{synthetic}} aromatic amidine compound {{which has a}} number of important biochemical effects, including inhibition of a family of esteroproteases (trypsin, urokinase, plasmin) previously linked to the complex process of tumor invasion. Previous work has suggested that exogenous natural protease inhibitors can block invasion of tumor cells across basement membranes (BM) in vitro. The authors studied the effect of BABIM on the human cell line HT- 1080 {{with the use of a}} quantitative in vitro amnion invasion assay system. They have verified the ability of these cells to grow in nude mice and metastasize via the lymphatics or blood vessels on the basis of the route of administration of the inoculum. Cells which were able to actively cross the entire BM were trapped on filters and counted by both brightfield microscopy and by beta <b>scintillation</b> counting of <b>cells</b> whose DNA was labeled with tritiated thymidine. In agreement with either counting technique, BABIM, at a concentration of 10 (- 4) M, significantly inhibited invasion (P less than 0. 005) over the 7 -day course of the experiments. Under these conditions, the inhibitor was nontoxic and did not alter the attachment of the cells to the amniotic membrane. Furthermore, a highly significant inhibition of invasion (P less than 0. 001) was also demonstrated across a variation in molar concentration of BABIM of more than 2 orders of magnitude. Most remarkably, cells were initially inhibited in their ability to invade in the presence of between 10 (- 9) and 10 (- 3) M BABIM. Measurement of Type IV specific collagenase in media from these cells shows a significant inhibition of activity in the presence of BABIM. These results suggest two, not necessarily exclusive, alternative interpretations: first, that inhibition of the proteolytic steps along the pathway of activation of basement membrane degrading enzymes results in inhibition of invasion; second, that arginine directed esteroproteases may work in concert with cellular collagenolytic metalloproteinases in the process of invasion by human tumor cells through native matrix barriers...|$|R
