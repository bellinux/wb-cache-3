5|$|Most bovids are diurnal. Social {{activity}} and feeding usually peak during dawn and dusk. Bovids typically rest before dawn, during midday, and after dark. They have various methods of social organisation and social behaviour, which are classified into solitary and gregarious behaviour. Bovids use {{different forms of}} vocal, olfactory, and tangible communication. Most species alternately feed and ruminate throughout the day. While small bovids forage in dense and closed habitat, larger species feed on high-fiber vegetation in open grasslands. Most bovids are polygynous. Mature bovids mate at <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> and smaller species may even mate twice. In some species, neonate bovids remain hidden for a week to two months, regularly nursed by their mothers; in other species, neonates are followers, accompanying their dams, rather than tending to remain hidden.|$|E

5|$|The eastern {{section of}} SR 190 begins at Olancha in the Owens Valley, at the {{intersection}} with US 395. The route heads northeast along the southeast side of Owens Lake to the junction with SR 136 southeast of Keeler, where it turns southeast and east around {{the south side of}} the Inyo Mountains. After passing the turnoff to Darwin, SR 190 enters Death Valley National Park and becomes curvier as it heads down into the Panamint Valley. The highway crosses the valley and then turns northeast over Towne Pass and into the northern part of Death Valley at Stovepipe Wells. Within the valley, {{at the intersection}} with North Highway, which leads to Scotty's Castle and Beatty, Nevada, SR 190 turns southeast through Death Valley, which it remains inside until the turnoff to Badwater Basin, the lowest point in North America, near the settlement of Furnace Creek.

5|$|All bovids mate at <b>least</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> {{and smaller}} species may even mate twice. Mating seasons occur {{typically}} {{during the rainy}} months for most bovids. As such, breeding might peak twice in the equatorial regions. The sheep and goats exhibit remarkable seasonality of reproduction, in the determination of which the annual cycle of daily photoperiod plays a pivotal role. Other factors that have a significant influence on this cycle include {{the temperature of the}} surroundinga, nutritional status, social interactions, the date of parturition and the lactation period. A study of this phenomenon concluded that goats and sheep are short-day breeders. Mating in most sheep breeds begins in summer or early autumn. Mating in sheep is also affected by melatonin, that advances the onset of the breeding season; and thyroxine, that terminates the breeding season. Estrus lasts for at most a day in bovids, with the exception of bovines and tragelaphines. Except the hartebeest and the topi, all bovids can detect estrus in females by testing the urine using the vomeronasal organ. Once the male is assured that the female is in estrus, he begins courtship displays; these displays vary greatly from the elaborate marches among gregarious species to the fervent licking of female genitalia among solitary species. Females, initially not receptive, ultimately mates with the male which has achieved dominance over others. Receptiveness is expressed by permission for mounting by the male and setting aside the tail by the female. Copulation generally takes a few seconds.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Subculture is {{the most}} common method for {{preservation}} fungi, but has a disadvantage of accumulation of sponta-neous mutations during the repeated subculture. To reduce the subculture frequency, the effect of preservation period at 4 oC in a slant culture was examined on the mycelia growth and lignocellulolytic enzyme activities of various basidiomycetes. Mushrooms, including Stereum ostrea, Coprinellus micaeus, Trametes versicolor, Hypholoma fasciculare, Wolfiporia extensa, Pleurotus pulmo-narius, Piptoporus betulinus and Ganoderma applanatum were not affected by the preservation period more than two years, indicating that they can be maintained by subculture every two years. Some other tested fungal strains showed a significant decrease in both viability and enzyme activity when they were maintained for two years, suggesting that they should be subcultured at <b>least</b> <b>once</b> in <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> <b>A</b> little correlation was found between the recovery of mycelial growth and extracellular enzyme activity.
