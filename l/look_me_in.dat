500|$|In April 2002, Hewson {{was one of}} {{the leaders}} of an effort which {{delivered}} over a million postcards demanding that the facility be shut down; recipients included British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Prince Charles, and Norman Askew, head of British Nuclear Fuels Limited. (The message to the first said, [...] "Tony, <b>look</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the eye and tell me I'm safe.") She personally delivered a giant postcard to Blair at 10Downing Street. The Shut Sellafield Campaign had its postcards stocked in Superquinn and Dunnes Stores supermarkets, and Hewson publicly engaged Tesco when they refused to do the same. The campaign was backed by celebrities, including Ronan Keating and Samantha Mumba, and Hewson made many newspaper and radio appearances on its behalf. It was the first prolonged exposure Hewson had to the public eye, after two decades of mostly being focused upon maintaining her privacy. Her continued activism also meant that she too would not always be around for the couple's children.|$|E

500|$|Guandique faced {{a minimum}} penalty of 30 {{years to a}} maximum of life {{imprisonment}} without the possibility of parole. In seeking the maximum possible sentence, the prosecutors stated that Guandique [...] "is unable to control himself and thus, will always remain a danger to women". A memo submitted by the prosecution in February 2011 cited Guandique's harassment of female staff in prison, including soliciting a nurse and masturbating in front of guards. Assistant U.S. Attorney Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez disclosed that he had traveled to El Salvador with a detective to investigate allegations that Guandique had fled his native country because of suspected attacks against local women dating back to 1999. During the sentencing hearing on February 11, Guandique said to Levy's family, [...] "I am sorry for what happened to your daughter", and insisted on his innocence. Before Judge Gerald Fisher reminded Susan Levy to address the court instead of the defendant, Levy said to him, [...] "Did you really take her life? <b>Look</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> my eyes and tell me." [...] Fisher denied Guandique's motion for retrial and handed down a sentence of 60 years in prison, stating that Guandique [...] "will be a danger for some time. He's a sexual predator." ...|$|E

[...] He was then told about the fire, but he denied having {{anything}} to do with it, claiming that he was not near the farm when the blaze occurred. A youth, John Solyem, was brought forward. He said that he had been watching the Gunness place and that he saw Lamphere running down the road from the Gunness house just before the structure erupted in flames.
