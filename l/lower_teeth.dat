5|$|Like other thyreophorans, Scelidosaurus was herbivorous. However, {{while some}} later ornithischian groups possessed teeth capable of {{grinding}} plant material, Scelidosaurus had smaller, less complex leaf-shaped teeth suitable for cropping vegetation and jaws capable of only vertical movement, {{due to a}} short jaw joint. Paul Barrett concluded that Scelidosaurus fed with a puncture-crush system of tooth-on-tooth action, with a precise but simple up-and-down jaw movement, in which the food was mashed between the inner side of the upper teeth and the outer side of the <b>lower</b> <b>teeth,</b> without the teeth actually touching each other as shown by very long vertical wear facets on the <b>lower</b> <b>teeth</b> alone.|$|E
5|$|Other highly {{specialized}} feeders include cookiecutter sharks, which feed on flesh sliced out of other larger fish and marine mammals. Cookiecutter teeth are enormous {{compared to the}} animal's size. The <b>lower</b> <b>teeth</b> are particularly sharp. Although {{they have never been}} observed feeding, they are believed to latch onto their prey and use their thick lips to make a seal, twisting their bodies to rip off flesh.|$|E
5|$|Pugs' {{legs are}} strong, straight, of {{moderate}} length, and are set well under. Their shoulders are moderately laid back. Their ankles are strong, their feet are small, their toes are well split-up, and their nails are black.

5|$|The cookiecutter shark {{exhibits}} {{a number of}} specializations to its mouth and pharynx for its parasitic lifestyle. The shark first secures itself to the body surface of its prey by closing its spiracles and retracting its basihyal (tongue) to create pressure {{lower than that of}} the surroundings; its suctorial lips ensure a tight seal. It then bites, using its narrow upper teeth as anchors while its razor sharp <b>lower</b> <b>teeth</b> slice into the prey. Finally, the shark twists and rotates its body to complete a circular cut, quite possibly aided by the initial forward momentum and subsequent struggles of its prey. The action of the <b>lower</b> <b>teeth</b> may also be assisted by back-and-forth vibrations of the jaw, a mechanism akin to that of an electric carving knife. This shark's ability to create strong suction into its mouth is likely also of utility in capturing smaller prey such as squid.|$|E
5|$|The cookiecutter shark has an elongated, cigar-shaped {{body with}} a short, bulbously rounded snout. The {{nostrils}} have a very short flap of skin in front. The large, oval, green eyes are placed forward on the head, though not {{so that there is}} extensive binocular vision. Behind the eyes are large spiracles, positioned on the upper surface of the head. The mouth is short, forming a nearly transverse line, and is surrounded by enlarged, fleshy, suctorial lips. There are 3037 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 2531 tooth rows in the lower jaw, increasing with body size. The upper and <b>lower</b> <b>teeth</b> are extremely different: the upper teeth are small, narrow, and upright, tapering to a single, smooth-edged cusp. The <b>lower</b> <b>teeth</b> are also smooth-edged, but much larger, broader, and knife-like, with their bases interlocking to form a single saw-like cutting edge. The five pairs of gill slits are small.|$|E
5|$|The premaxillary bones {{each house}} a single incisor, {{which is located}} at the front tip. They end in a V shape at the front margin and in a narrow point at the back margin. Inside each premaxilla is a large opening, the {{anterior}} palatal foramen. The maxillary bone contains the other upper teeth. The mandible ranges from thin to robust and houses the <b>lower</b> <b>teeth.</b>|$|E

5|$|Domestic American {{alligators}} {{range from}} long and slender to short and robust, possibly due to variations in {{factors such as}} growth rate, diet, and climate. American alligators have broad snouts, especially in captive individuals. When the jaws are closed, {{the edges of the}} upper jaws cover the <b>lower</b> <b>teeth</b> which fit into the jaws' hollows. Like the spectacled caiman, this species has a bony nasal ridge, though it is less prominent. The teeth number 74–80. Dorsally, adult American alligators may be olive, brown, gray, or black in color, while their undersides are cream-colored.|$|E
5|$|Lemuriform origins {{are unclear}} and debated. American {{paleontologist}} Philip Gingerich proposed that lemuriform primates evolved {{from one of}} several genera of European adapids based on similarities between the front <b>lower</b> <b>teeth</b> of adapids and the toothcomb of extant lemuriforms; however, this view is not strongly supported {{due to a lack}} of clear transitional fossils. Instead, lemuriforms may be descended from a very early branch of Asian cercamoniines or sivaladapids that migrated to northern Africa.|$|E
5|$|The {{kitefin shark}} has a {{moderately}} elongated {{body with a}} very short, rounded snout. The eyes and spiracles are large. The lips are thick with pleats or fringes, though are not modified to be suctorial. There are 1621 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 1720 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The upper teeth are small and spike-shaped, curving slightly towards {{the corners of the}} mouth. The <b>lower</b> <b>teeth</b> are very large, knife-shaped, and serrated, with their bases interlocking to form a continuous cutting surface.|$|E
30|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{evaluate}} on CBCT the changes of alveolar dehiscence and fenestration after augmented corticotomy-assisted orthodontic treatment compared with traditional pre-surgical orthodontics, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our results suggest that, after augmented corticotomy-assisted orthodontic treatment, both dehiscence and fenestration improved for the <b>lower</b> anterior <b>teeth.</b> Compared with traditional treatment, the augmented corticotomy-assisted orthodontic treatment showed more healing effect for dehiscences than for fenestration in both upper and <b>lower</b> anterior <b>teeth.</b> Table  7 indicates that, compared with traditional treatment, augmented corticotomy-assisted orthodontic treatment {{has the potential to}} protect both upper and <b>lower</b> healthy anterior <b>teeth</b> against dehiscence.

500|$|The {{porbeagle}} {{is a very}} stout-bodied shark with a fusiform (spindle-like) shape. The long, conical snout tapers to a sharp point, and {{is supported}} by enlarged, highly calcified [...] cartilages. The eyes are large and black, without nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). The small, S-shaped nostrils are positioned in front of and {{below the level of}} the eyes. The mouth is large and strongly curved, with moderately protrusible jaws. North Atlantic sharks have 28–29 upper tooth rows and 26–27 <b>lower</b> <b>tooth</b> rows, while Southern Hemisphere sharks have 30–31 upper tooth rows and 27–29 <b>lower</b> <b>tooth</b> rows. Each tooth has a strongly arched base and a nearly straight, awl-like central cusp, which is flanked by a pair of smaller cusplets in all but the smallest individuals. The five pairs of gill slits are long and precede the pectoral fin bases.|$|R
5|$|The nervous shark has {{a rather}} stout, {{spindle-shaped}} {{body and a}} short, broadly rounded snout. The anterior margin of each nostril is extended into a slender nipple-shaped lobe. The moderately large eyes are horizontally oval in shape and equipped with nictitating membranes. The mouth lacks conspicuous furrows at the corners and contains 25–30 upper and 23–28 lower tooth rows. The upper teeth are narrow and angled, with coarsely serrated edges. The <b>lower</b> <b>teeth</b> are more slender and upright in shape, and have finer serrations. The five pairs of gill slits are medium in length.|$|E
5|$|Tooth shape {{depends on}} the shark's diet: those that feed on mollusks and {{crustaceans}} have dense and flattened teeth used for crushing, those that feed on fish have needle-like teeth for gripping, and those that feed on larger prey such as mammals have pointed <b>lower</b> <b>teeth</b> for gripping and triangular upper teeth with serrated edges for cutting. The teeth of plankton-feeders such as the basking shark are small and non-functional.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilian teeth {{vary from}} blunt and dull to sharp and needle-like. Broad-snouted species have teeth that vary in size, while those of slender-snouted species are more uniform. The teeth of {{crocodiles}} and gharials {{tend to be}} more visible than those of alligators and caimans when the jaws are closed. The easiest way to distinguish crocodiles from alligators is by looking at their jaw line. The teeth on the lower jaw of an alligator fit into sockets in the upper jaw, so only the upper teeth are visible when the mouth is closed. The teeth on the lower jaw of a crocodile fit into grooves {{on the outside of the}} top jaw making both the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>teeth</b> visible when the mouth is closed.|$|E

5|$|Physically, the Australian blacktip shark {{can only}} {{reliably}} {{be distinguished from}} the common blacktip shark {{by the number of}} vertebrae (174–182 total, 84–91 before the tail in C. tilstoni, 182–203 total, 94–102 before the tail in C. limbatus). It has a moderately robust, spindle-shaped body and a long, pointed snout. The anterior rims of the nostrils are slightly enlarged into low triangular flaps. The large, circular eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes. The furrows at the corners of the mouth are barely evident. There are 32–35 upper and 29–31 lower tooth rows; each upper tooth has a slender, upright cusp and fine serrations that become coarser near the base, while the <b>lower</b> <b>teeth</b> are narrower and more finely serrated. The five pairs of gill slits are long.|$|E
