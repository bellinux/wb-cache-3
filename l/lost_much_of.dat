5|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{centralized}} logistical system, the Polish armies were encumbered {{by large}} baggage trains.

The wagon use for defensive formations was perfected by the Cossacks, and to a smaller extent used by other Commonwealth units. The Commonwealth army relied on cavalry, which the nobility saw as a much more respectable type of a troop than the infantry. Despite the reforms of the 17th century, it <b>lost</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> its military significance in the 18th century; the primary reason for this was a lack of sufficient funding.|$|E

The allotment system was favored by liberal reformers at the time, including Schurz, but instead proved detrimental to American Indians. They <b>lost</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> their land through later sales to unscrupulous white speculators.
