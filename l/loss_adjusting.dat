40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} whether tooth loss {{is associated with}} increased blood pressure among adults after controlling for socioeconomic, health, and lifestyle confounders. We also assessed the interactions between tooth loss and smoking status and tooth loss and age on systolic blood pressure (SBP). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A population-based cross-sectional study was carried out with 1720 adults from Florianópolis, Brazil. Data collection included blood pressure, anthropometric measures, and a questionnaire on socio-demographics, self-rated health, diabetes, self-reported number of natural teeth, and dental prosthesis. We used linear multivariable regression models for the association of blood pressure with tooth <b>loss</b> <b>adjusting</b> for potential confounders. RESULTS: Edentulous subjects had a SBP 8. 3  mmHg (95 % CI 0. 1; 16. 7) higher than those with more than 10 teeth in both arches after adjustment for potential confounders. We found interaction between tooth loss and smoking status. Moderate/heavy smokers were associated with considerably higher SBP than light, former or non-smokers among edentulous and also partly among dentate with less than 10 teeth {{in at least one}} arch, but there was no real association between smoking and SBP among those with 10 or more teeth in both arches.

For children who may not understand <b>loss,</b> <b>adjusting</b> to life after it can become a nearly impossible feat. Children’s reactions to loss and the grief often include anger, anxiety, confusion, fear, sadness, shock, guilt, and regret (Murthy & Smith, 2005). Nature and art have been used as healing methods in the past, but rarely in schools. Because children spend much of their day at school, outdoor landscapes could be designed to that help alleviate children’s grief and commemorate their memories. This master’s project proposes a set of guidelines and a palette of elements {{that can be used to}} create landscapes for grieving in elementary schools. To define these guidelines I combined stages of grieving from two different psychological models with design elements that could help children at each stage of their grief. These guidelines and elements were then tested by applying them at three different elementary schools in Manhattan, Kansas: Marlatt Elementary, Northview Elementary, and Theodore Roosevelt Elementary. The designs at the three elementary schools help illustrate the flexibility of the guidelines and palette of design elements. Not only can the selected elements vary, but the sites can range in size and location. The palette of elements will enable schools to implement landscapes for grieving in a range of places and conditions...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine whether adults with obesity and {{metabolic}} syndrome who screen as high risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) lose less weight as part of a weight loss intervention than those who screen as low risk. METHOD: We conducted a secondary analysis of a randomized trial comparing 2 weight loss interventions consisting of dietary counseling for adults with obesity and metabolic syndrome. Participants were screened for sleep apnea using a validated screening questionnaire. Percent weight loss was calculated from weight measured at baseline and intervention end (12 months). Weight loss of 5 % or greater was considered clinically significant. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models estimated the association between OSA screening status (high vs. low risk) and percent weight loss and clinically significant weight <b>loss,</b> <b>adjusting</b> for relevant covariates including body mass index and sleep duration. RESULTS: Nearly half of participants (45. 8 %) screened as high risk for OSA. Participants who screened as high risk for OSA lost less weight (1. 2 % +/- 4. 2 % vs. 4. 2 % +/- 5. 3 %) and were less likely to lose 5 % or greater (24. 4 % vs. 75. 6 %) than participants without OSA. CONCLUSION: Among adults with obesity and metabolic syndrome, those at high risk for OSA lost less weight in response to a dietary counseling intervention than adults with low risk of OSA. Routine OSA screening should be considered as part of weight loss treatment programs. Additional research is needed to determine how to tailor weight loss treatment for those with high risk for OSA.

40|$|Insurance {{companies}} have, for ages, outsourced claims settlement {{processes to}} {{third party service}} providers such as loss adjusters. Outsourcing in other industries {{is used as a}} strategic tool, but in the claims department of an insurance company, it is primarily done to acquire specialist skills to assist in the claims settlement process. While popular perception identifies off-shoring as {{the most effective way to}} trim business costs, this is not true for many reasons in the case of outsourcing claims management; the primary reason being, claims handling requires a very high level of expertise. The objective of this paper is to unearth the reasons and impact of outsourcing claims from the view of a <b>loss</b> <b>adjusting</b> company. The dissertation gives an insight into the practices in the insurance industry in India and UK, with special emphasis on considering outsourcing as an option for diversification for third party service providers. It shows the feasibility of outsourcing claims management with the help of perspectives of insurers and loss adjusters. The benefits of outsourcing claims, especially with respect to costs and expertise, are highlighted by means of a claims handling process for managing outsourced claims, which would increase efficiency of insurers. The objectives are achieved by using the Theory of Transaction Costs and the concept of core competencies. The methodology used for analysis also involves face-to-face interviews and e-mail interviews, with the experienced people in the insurance industry in India as well is in UK. These individuals, by virtue of their experience, have a strong grasp on the subject and can analyse the perspectives of off-shoring claims. Thus, combining the perspectives of the various players in the insurance sector and data collected from journals, we have analyzed the strategic perspectives of off-shoring claims...|$|E

Associations between bone lead biomarkers and tooth loss were similar in magnitude to the increased odds observed in participants who were current smokers. CONCLUSION. Long-term cumulative lead exposure is associated with increased odds of tooth loss.

As the frequency of flooding increases in England and Wales coupled with {{an increase in the number}} of properties at risk of flooding and the attendant huge (insured) economic costs of flooding, the services received by homeowners during flood damage repair works, have not been spared criticism, Both the Welsh Consumer Council report and the Warwickshire Trading Standards report raised serious questions about the level of service in insurance claims for the repair of flood-damaged domestic property. This research project was therefore aimed at investigating the level of service quality and determinants of homeowners’ satisfaction in England and Wales with respect to flood damage repair works during insurance claims. A comprehensive literature review was conducted on customers’ needs, satisfaction and service quality, flooding and related issues, and the repair of flood damaged domestic property, in order to set the framework for the research and shape the development of the research questions/hypotheses. The study employed a two-phased sequential mixed methods approach, commencing with 20 in-depth interviews with homeowners, repairers, insurers and loss adjusters. Findings from the initial exploratory study (and from the literature review) informed the development of a questionnaire instrument, which incorporated elements of SERVQUAL, the generic service quality measurement instrument. Survey data were collected for the quantitative phase of the study from a sample of 126 homeowners, which was then analysed to test the hypotheses put forward in the study. The data did not yield a set of reliable and interpretable factors of service quality from the three service quality scales used to measure homeowners’ perceptions of the performance of insurers, loss adjusters and contractors. However, of the three key service providers, the contractor’s performance was the best predictor of homeowners’ overall satisfaction during flood damage reinstatement claims, accounting for seven times the combined unique contribution of insurance and <b>loss</b> <b>adjusting</b> firms.
