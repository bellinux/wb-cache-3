500|$|Marvin Digs, which Bakshi {{conceived}} as a [...] "flower child picture", was not completed {{the way he had}} intended: It [...] "was going to have curse words and sex scenes, and a lot more than that. [...] Of course, they wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> that." [...] He described the disappointing result as a [...] "typical 1967 limited-animation theatrical". Animation historian Michael Barrier called the film [...] "an offensively bad picture, the kind that makes people who love animation get up and leave the theater in disgust". Production of Mighty Heroes ended when Bakshi left Terrytoons.|$|E
500|$|The 48-page {{prestige}} format one-shot comic took {{a considerable}} amount of time to produce. Both Moore and Bolland are well known for their meticulous and time-consuming work; both creators' then-recently finished 12-issue maxiseries titles—Moore's Watchmen and Bolland's Camelot 3000—had seen delays. He was aided by the laid back attitude taken by DC, who he says [...] "seemed prepared to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> it at my own pace." [...] The original editor, Len Wein, left the company, and was replaced by Dennis O'Neil, a [...] "very hands-off sort of guy," [...] with whom Bolland only recalls having one conversation about the book.|$|E

In July 2005, it was announced by the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) that Will & Graces season premiere for season eight would be performed live. It was also confirmed that actor Alec Baldwin would appear in the episode. This was Baldwin's third appearance, as he guest starred in two episodes from season seven, playing Will's boss. His initial decision to do the show was to work with Megan Mullally, who plays Karen; [...] "I just love Megan. And so I said, 'Well, if you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> it with Megan.' And they said 'You got it.' So I went and did that with them for four [...] It was fun. For me now, it's about who I work with." ...|$|E
500|$|After partnering {{for one of}} Kindt's {{previous}} works, , Dark Horse Publisher Mike Richardson asked Kindt {{to pitch}} another book. Kindt sent the proposal for MIND MGMT and was happy when it was accepted because Dark Horse was [...] "the only publisher able to pay me a living wage and also <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> exactly what I wanted no matter what." [...] The series was initially approved for over 50 issues, but Kindt pruned away excess material and reduced the run to 36 issues. Despite the reduction in length, the final product is still almost {{identical to the original}} pitch. Diana Schutz, editor of 3 Story, was originally slated to work with Kindt again, but the project was handed to newly promoted editor Brendan Wright very early in production. Kindt described their input as [...] "invaluable" [...] and considers Wright to be a collaborator.|$|E
500|$|In 2017, Holt {{talked about}} {{recording}} the guitar solos, [...] "That's {{one of my}} favorites on the album. I'm never blown away by anything I've done musically. I always want to redo it five minutes after I'm done with it. That goes down to songwriting too - it's never going to be perfect. Nothing's perfect. So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. I just sat down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> my own thing. Tom came in after I had been messing around with a solo for a half an hour and he told me the first take was perfect. I told him they've got to let me know because I'll keep going over it and sometimes you lose a good thing when that happens. You've got to know when to just let it go and keep it whether it's raw or rough or perfect or maybe there a little bit of magic in there." ...|$|E

[...] "Rex" [...] Lewis / The Doctor / Cobra Commander [...] The Baroness's brother, {{a former}} soldier who {{was thought to}} have been killed during a mission led by Duke [...] instead, he became the {{disfigured}} head scientist of Military Armament Research Syndicate (MARS). USA Today reported that Gordon-Levitt would play multiple roles. He wore prosthetic makeup under a mask that was redesigned from the comics because the crew found it too reminiscent of the Ku Klux Klan. Upon seeing concept art of the character, Gordon-Levitt signed on because; [...] "I was like, 'I get to be that? You're going to make that [...] in real life and stick it on me? Cool. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> it.' That's a once-in-lifetime opportunity." [...] Gordon-Levitt is a friend of Tatum and they co-starred in Stop-Loss and Havoc. His casting provided extra incentive for Tatum to join the film. Gordon-Levitt described his vocal performance as being [...] "half reminiscent" [...] of Chris Latta's voice for the , but also half his own ideas, because he felt rendering it fully would sound ridiculous.|$|E
500|$|Although Scott-Heron {{received}} top-billing for the release, Jamie xx worked {{solely on}} the remix project. For We're New Here, he remixed 13 of the original album's 15 songs, including its [...] "interlude" [...] cuts, mixing Scott-Heron's vocal tracks from the original recording sessions over his own beats and instrumentals, rather than the original music. Many of the remixes were created by Jamie xx on his laptop, while on tour with The xx. In a March2010 interview, {{he said that the}} label [...] "gave me the parts and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> whatever I want, so I've been doing it on my laptop on tour. [...] only using [...] vocals, I'm not using any of the original music from it, which is very freeing". On his intentions for the album's music, he explained in an interview for The Irish Times, [...] "I wanted it to sound like everything I had been listening to in London. I wanted it to sound like something you’d hear on pirate radio. You hear so many different genres, and it’s all so convoluted and mixed-up, but it makes sense when you turn on the station".|$|E
500|$|When it {{came time}} to record a lead single, Yankovic once again turned his {{attention}} to Michael Jackson. Jackson had just released his album Bad, a follow-up to 1983's immensely successful album Thriller. After Yankovic first heard the lead single, [...] "Bad", he immediately envisioned a parody entitled [...] "Fat". Initially, Yankovic didn't want to record another Michael Jackson parody. He later said, [...] "I was still primarily known as the 'Eat It' guy and I didn't want to become known as the guy who just rides Michael's coattails." [...] He later relented and sought out Jackson for permission. Jackson, a fan of Yankovic's work, had already let Yankovic parody his 1983 hit single [...] "Beat It". When presented with the new potential parody, Jackson not only approved it, but let Yankovic use his own Moonwalker subway set for the music video. Yankovic later presented Jackson with a gold record of Even Worse after the album sold over 500,000 copies. Jackson was so pleased with the song and video, he ordered twelve copies to give to his friends. [...] Yankovic later said, [...] "He doesn't have to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> this kind of stuff. [...] The only reason he would let me is because he has a great sense of humor." ...|$|E

[...] Kosinski wanted to embrace the general ambiance of the film, and wished to not use the internet as a model or use a formula emulative of The Matrix film series. As neither individuals were in equal agreement on choosing a perspective to conceive the film, Kosinski asked Bailey to lend him money in order to create a conceptual prototype of the Tron: Legacy universe, which was eventually presented at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International. [...] "So, we went into Disney," [...] he recalled, [...] "and I told them, 'We can talk about this all day, but in order to really get on the same page, I need to show you what this world looks and feels like. Give me some money and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> a small test that will give you a hint for a couple minutes of it, and see what you think.'" ...|$|E
