As regards the mechanisms <b>of</b> language <b>control,</b> we describe several empirical markers of language switching and their relation to inhibition, as a potentially important mechanism <b>of</b> language <b>control.</b> From this overview it becomes apparent that some, but not all, markers indicate the occurrence of inhibition during language switching and, thus, language control.

25|$|The {{previous}} section showed how self-efficacy {{can be related}} to a person's <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> and stress also has a relationship in these areas. Self-efficacy can be something that people use to deal with the stress that they are faced with in their everyday lives. Some findings suggest that higher levels of external <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> combined with lower levels self-efficacy are related to higher illness-related psychological distress. In the {{previous section}}, the different types of <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> internal and external, were mentioned. Based on the definition of people who have an external <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> we can see that this can be associated with higher levels of stress. A study conducted by Bollini and others reveals that individuals who have a high external <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> tend to have higher levels of psychological and physical problems. These people are also more vulnerable to external influences and as a result they become more responsive to stress.|$|E

40|$|When {{scholars}} address privacy as {{a condition}} in contemporary society it can become a very difficult subject to approach on a general level. With public concerns rising surrounding matters of digital tracking and surveillance, discussions of privacy have found a new dimension in digital information. Yet defining how digital privacy should be approached, in particular regard to a general conception of privacy, remains unclear. Research spanning across the social sciences, law, economics and technical fields have all taken their own perspectives towards studying various forms of privacy. This study seeks to unify privacy- related discourses by evaluating the conceptualization of privacy throughout existing literature {{in order to determine}} what fundamentally distinguishes digital privacy from general privacy while remaining intrinsically related. To do this, I employ Michael E. Brown's 'sub- theoretical notion' (2014) to turn privacy discourses inwards, seeking the underlying logic contained within its seemingly disparate dimensions. Using a sample of 28 purposively selected texts analyzed through a structural content analysis, resulting in a refined sample of n= 4, 486 structural elements contained within the texts, the various relational dynamics of privacy discussions are evaluated, noting their interrelations. I arrive at information tangibility and <b>loci</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> as the two most intrinsic elements of privacy, dramatized by developments in technological mediation, which can thus both unify and distinguish the various forms of privacy research. In a discussion of implications of this exploratory study, I conclude with how the integration of privacy's sub-theoretical notion (information tangibility and <b>loci</b> <b>of</b> <b>control)</b> allows for current privacy-related discourses to acknowledge not only their own limitations to social life, but to move beyond the singular notion of a correct conception of privacy to see instead how each conception is interrelated via the unifying logic of the sub- theoretical. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} is on the regulation of water processing and feeding mechanisms in suspension-feeding bivalve molluscs. In particular it addresses the two currently debated schools of thought regarding the <b>loci</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and biophysics <b>of</b> water processing rates in bivalves. Within these mainly opposing viewpoints, water processing activity is seen either as autonomically regulated, with the ciliary pump functioning at a single, evolutionarily adapted rate, or as physiologically regulated to meet nutritional and metabolic needs. There are many published studies providing excellent support for both positions. The present work attempts to address the arguments presented by both sides, in part by applying new technology to assist in measuring and visualizing volume flux through the animal. Planar (2 D) particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used to visualize and calculate flow fields generated by water processing activity in three species of bivalves: blue mussels, Mytilus edulis; Atlantic bay scallops, Argopecten irradians; and eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica. Four potential <b>loci</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> were examined in the studies; exhalant velocity (V), cross-sectional area of the exhalant aperture (Ax), clearance rate (CR) and ctenidial morphology. Volume flux (Q) was calculated {{as the product of}} V and Ax. Studies examined modulation of pumping activity either {{in the presence of a}} variety of endogenously secreted neuromodulatory agents (e. g., serotonin and phorbol esters), or under conditions of varying diet quality and quantity. Major findings of the studies included the following: 1) effects of neuromodulators on isolated ctenidial tissue were not the same as the effect in vivo; 2) in vivo responses of mussels were different than those of scallops both when exposed to the same neuromodulatory agents and in some cases the same feeding regimes; and 3) <b>control</b> <b>of</b> water processing and feeding can be decoupled and altered independently in both mussels and scallops. The implications of these results are two-fold: 1) points of disagreement are, in part, a matter of differential interpretations of the same data sets, and are, to some degree, semantic; and 2) both autonomous and physiological regulatory mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>control</b> can be employed in species-specific manners. ...|$|R

Indeed, there is evidence here that changes in <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> in later life relate more visibly to increased externality (rather than reduced internality) if the two concepts are taken to be orthogonal.
