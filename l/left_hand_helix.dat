50|$|After being {{dispatched}} {{from the}} station, the train makes a left hand turn, entering the 164 ft lift hill. Once at the top, the train drops {{back down and}} enters a diving loop. Next, the train makes a short left hand turn before making an upward right turn. The train then drops back down and goes through a artificial splashdown. Following a zero-gravity roll, the train then makes a banked left turn and an upward right turn leading into the mid-course brake run. After passing through the brake run, the train drops down into a tunnel (under a path). Upon exiting the tunnel, the train makes a left turn, followed by a right which leads directly into the last inversion, an inline twist. After making a right turn into a second tunnel, the train makes a <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>helix</b> which leads into the final brake run.|$|E
5000|$|After {{departing from}} the station, the train makes {{a left turn}} towards the 167 ft chain lift hill. After {{reaching}} the top, {{the sound of a}} banshee screaming is played as the train drops 150 ft into a heavily-banked right turn. After reaching the bottom of the drop, riders enter a dive loop immediately followed by a vertical loop around the lift hill. Continuing down the valley, the train enters the third inversion, a zero-gravity roll, where riders experience the feeling of weightlessness. Next, the train makes an upward left-hand turn into a [...] "pretzel knot" [...] (an element where the train enters a dive loop, followed by an Immelmann loop). Upon exiting the pretzel knot, the train enters a second vertical loop before making a right turn into an inline twist. Following a downward <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>helix,</b> the train makes a final banked right turn into the final brake run leading back to the station. At night, Banshee employs state-of-the-art lighting and fog effects to enhance the riding experience.|$|E

40|$|Circular dichroism {{spectra of}} poly(dG-dC) in the {{presence}} of some zinc complexes exhibit the characteristic inversion associated with the formation of a <b>left</b> <b>handed</b> <b>helix.</b> The transition of B to Z DNA is cooperative and slow. The concentration of zinc complex at the mid point of the transition is strongly dependent upon the nature of the ligand bound to zinc. The most efficient species is one with a tetradentate amine for which the mid point is observed at a zinc:nucleotide ratio of 1 : 24. 31 P spectra of one of these complexes confirm the presence of a <b>left</b> <b>handed</b> <b>helix...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Left</b> {{or right}} <b>handed</b> alpha {{helicity}} can be induced in a pentapeptide (ANGYG) by appending <b>left</b> or right <b>handed</b> helical cycles as chiral templates. This sequence {{corresponds to a}} rare <b>left</b> <b>handed</b> <b>helix</b> found in the protein alanine racemase. Circular dichroism spectra reveal that pentapeptide ANGYG has no detectable structure in aq phosphate buffer, {{that it is an}} ambidextrous peptide in that it can be directed to fold into either a <b>left</b> <b>handed</b> or right <b>handed</b> alpha <b>helix</b> in water, with greater propensity for the uncommon <b>left</b> <b>handed</b> than the normal right handed conformation. A helix-inducing cyclic peptide at both ends of this peptide was more effective at inducing alpha helicity than a single cyclic peptide at one end. The alpha helical cyclic peptides provide novel tools for folding short peptides into thermodynamically unstable helices in water, and for studying factors that control chirality and helix induction...|$|R

40|$|Theoretical {{investigations}} {{were conducted}} on the gas phase all-anti zigzag geometries of C~ 3 ~ through C~ 7 ~ perfluoro-n-alkanes and the perfluoro-n-octanoate anion using various semiempirical, density functional theory, and composite method approaches. The major theoretical methods are in agreement that the gas phase zigzag geometry of &#x 3 e;=C~ 3 ~ perfluoro-n-alkyl chains is a transition state between the <b>left</b> and right <b>handed</b> helical/twisted global minima. For the C~ 3 ~ perfluoropropyl group, a slightly twisted (about 1 to 2 degree central F-C-C-F dihedral angle) near zigzag conformation exists as a global minimum, whereas helical global minima are obtained for C~ 4 ~ and longer perfluoroalkyl chains. The <b>left</b> to right <b>handed</b> <b>helix</b> inversion activation energy for C~ 4 ~ and C~ 5 ~ perfluoroalkyl groups is estimated at between 1 and 2 kcal/mol...|$|R

40|$|Deoxyribonucleic acid, {{generally}} {{referred to}} as DNA by its acronym, {{is the basis of}} life, which contains the information for the development and functioning of all the living organisms. The DNA research began in 1868, when Swiss physiological chemist Friedrich Miescher first identified what he called “nuclein” inside the nuclei of human white blood cells. In 1889, R. Altmann separated nuclein from protein and because of its acidic character he named it nucleic acid. Phoebus Levene identified the components of DNA and showed that they were linked in the order phosphate- sugar-base to form units which he referred as nucleotide and suggested that the DNA molecule consisted of a string of nucleotide units linked together through the phosphate groups, which is the ‘backbone’ of the molecule. The role of DNA in heredity was recognized in 1944, when Avery and co-workers published their famous result that DNA and not proteins were the carriers of genetic information (Avery et al., 1944). The complementary base-pair rule was found by Chargaff in 1950 (Chargaff et al., 1950). A milestone in DNA research was the double helix structure which was proposed by Watson and Crick in 1953 based upon the X-ray fiber diffraction data from fibres of DNA obtained by Rosalind Franklin (Watson and Crick, 1953). From the double helical structure, it was immediately obvious how information could pass {{from one generation to the}} next by synthesis of DNA complementary strands from parent strands. In 1962 they received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery along with the crystallographer Maurice Wilkins. The first published account of the directed chemical synthesis of an oligonucleotide occurred in 1955 when Michelson and Todd reported the preparation of a dithymidinyl nucleotide (Michelson and Todd, 1955). In the late 1950 ’s Khorana and his group were able to synthesize oligoribonucleotides that were used to confirm the Genetic Code. In 1968, Khorana received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their interpretation of the genetic code and its function in protein synthesis. Khorana’s method was revolutionary at the time and produced a truly remarkable feat: the synthesis of an active 72 -mer tRNA molecule, which was published in Nature (Agarwal et al., 1970). However, it was not until the late 1970 ’s that the development of DNA research became explosive, when synthetic DNA fragments became commercially available. Pohl and Jovin first observed the salt-induced cooperative conformational changes of the synthetic DNA poly(dG-dC). poly(dG-dC) duplex, from a right-handed <b>helix</b> to <b>left</b> <b>handed</b> <b>helix</b> from the circular dichroism study (Pohl and Jovin, 1972) ...|$|R

50|$|The train departs {{the station}} and {{immediately}} climbs the 147 ft lift hill. Once the train has crested {{the top of the}} lift hill, it banks to the right and drops at 62.1 mph into a vertical loop. Exiting the vertical loop, the train then soars through a zero-g roll, and then another vertical loop. Coming out of the second vertical loop, the train makes a highly banked speed turn to the left and travels up into a cobra roll. Leaving the cobra roll, the train travels onwards into a right <b>hand</b> <b>helix</b> which goes {{through the center of the}} second vertical loop. Pulling out of the helix, the train enters the mid-course brake run (which does not slow it down). Flying off the mid-course brake run, the train drops down into a corkscrew which leads into a wide <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> banked curve. Speeding through and out of the curve, the train then soars over an airtime hill, and into a sharp upwards helix the left and onto the final brake run.|$|R
