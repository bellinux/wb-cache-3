40|$|The {{experimental}} {{results of the}} measurements of the explosion pressure and rate of explosion pressure rise {{as a function of}} propane/butane concentration in the mixture with air in the 20 L explosion chamber are tested. The research was aimed at determination of the explosion pressure and limits. The influence of initial temperature of the mixture (changing in the range of 293 – 473 K) on the fundamental explosion parameters was also investigated. The ignition source was an induction electrical spark. It was stated, that the increase of initial temperature of the LPG-air mixture causes a significant increase of the explosion range. From the experimental result, the concentration of LPG and air mixture just explodes at the range 2 % to 10 % of LPG in air. The concentration of LPG at 4 % gives the highest value of explosion pressure which at this condition, an explosion of LPG becomes very dangerous. The highest of deflagration index for LPG is 29. So, the designing of <b>LPG</b> tank <b>storage</b> should have value of deflagration index more than 29 to resist the over pressure from happen. The change of concentration of the LPG-air mixture causes a significant effect to maximum explosion pressure and maximum rate pressure rise. But it not means that the more concentration of LPG in air will increase the explosion pressure...|$|R

However, the potential benefit of LPG usage in domestic or residential sectors in Malaysia is hampered by LPG residue in cylinder.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{document}} the manner in which a pro-poor company can deliver ongoing health benefits and improve environmental sustainability in a manner that addresses child and maternal mortality (in line with millennium development goals 4, 5 and 7). Design/methodology/approach – Field research in Mozambique including 12 in-depth interviews with key personnel from December 2006 to January 2007. Findings – First, clear threats to the success of VidaGás' pro-poor business model encompass insufficient liquefied petroleum gas (<b>LPG)</b> supply and <b>storage</b> facilities; poor industrial and commercial infrastructure in Northern Mozambique; inadequate training of retailers in LPG use; and inadequate consumer knowledge of the benefits of LPG. Second, key innovations employed by VidaGás to overcome these obstacles consist of the introduction of a novel cold chain to safeguard medicines; a complex supply chain to ensure timely delivery; and the exploitation of local knowledge and expertise to expand the uptake of LPG by Mozambicans. Practical implications – The case study focuses on a business problem with significant development implications. The challenge is to ensure a reliable supply of LPG in Northern Mozambique. To meet this challenge, VidaGás must achieve its stated goal of becoming a revenue-generating entity within three years. In order to create a viable market for LPG, VidaGás must not only increase the uptake of LPG by poor consumers, it must expand LPG market access to commercial consumers, while raising additional capital. Originality/value – The paper contributes to the literature on social entrepreneurship and demonstrates how to link for-profit business imperatives with development goals.

40|$|In under {{to reduce}} the Public Service Obligation (PSO) on oil fuel, the {{goverment}} of Indonesia initianted a program of conversion of oil fuel into gas fuel (BBG) for passenger cars. In supporting this program, it is required to develop the component of combustion system. One of the components is strorage tank for BBG that must be carefully designed to avoid burst type failure. Based on previous research, a toroidal tank can withstand higher limit pressure than the PERTAMINA <b>LPG</b> 3 kg <b>storage</b> tank used nowadays in Indonesia household. The present study was exstended to toroidal tank of elliptic cross-section. The strength in term of limit pressure was evaluated numerically using the ANSYS 13 finite element software. The ANSYS SHELL 181 element type was used. Limit pressure were obtained via nonlinier analysis using the well-known Newton-Raphson algorithm, and corresponding stress and strain were evaluated. The results show that toroidal tank having elliptic ratio (a/b) of 1. 0 (circular) can withstand highest limit pressure, both for in-plane and out-of-plane elliptic, i. e., 1. 16 times the pressure to yield (py). Attachment of a nozzle on intrados position results in reducing the limit pressure by 5. 21 %, becomes 1. 1 py. The result of corresponding volume expansion when the limit pressure was reached is 0. 337 % of the initial volume. It {{is interesting to note}} that limit pressure become lower than the pressure to yield when the ratio of major to minor axis of the ellip higher than 1. 4. In conclusion. the value of ellipticity a/b must not be higher than 1. 4 for further development of a toroidal tank. keywords: toroidal, in-plane elliptic, out-of-plane elliptic, limit pressure, volume expansio...|$|R

50|$|During the 6AM to 2PM {{shift at}} the factory, workers were {{required}} to take a routine sample {{from each of the}} <b>LPG</b> <b>storage</b> tanks. A team composed of a plant operator, the shift fireman and a laboratory technician were taking a sample from sphere no.443. The operator, {{due to the fact that}} he had only a single valve spanner, opened the valves in the incorrect order. This caused the release of a small amount of caustic soda and a small amount of gas when he opened the lower valve. This prompted the operator to close the valve and then reopen it, leading to only a few drops emerging. The upper valve was then opened fully. This led to a very powerful jet of propane to rush out. This release splashed up from the drain and gave frost burns to the operator on the face and forearm. As he recoiled from the flow, the operator partly pulled off the valve handle. The fireman, losing sight of the operator, turned on the water supply to the sprays fitted to the sphere and, with the operator, attempted to reposition the valve handle and shut the valve.

Among the several seismic source parameters obtained, the reliable precursor found was the microseismic Event Release Rate (ERR) of micro fractures before failure, which is the most significant instability indicator of underground structure.
