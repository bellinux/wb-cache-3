40|$|A {{method is}} {{reported}} for the isolation of `vacuoplasts' from Poterioochromonas malhamensis. Vacuoplasts are separated mechanically by centrifugation on silica-sol gradients. They consist of the <b>leucosin</b> storage vacuole, {{a portion of the}} plasma membrane, and some cytoplasmic components. This method is suited to give a high yield of vacuoplasts...|$|E

Here we announce the complete genome sequence of L. kimchii IMSNU 11154 consisting of a 2, 101, 787 -bp chromosome and five plasmids. The strain has genes for dextran formation from sucrose and for mannitol formation from fructose. Antimicrobial and antioxidative functions of L. kimchii IMSNU 11154 could be attributed to a <b>leucosin</b> B-like peptide and multiple enzymes to reduce hydrogen peroxide and oxidized thiols, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{secretion}} of chitinases in {{the digestive}} tract of most fish species indicate that fishes must {{play an important role}} in the recycling of chitin carbon and nitrogen. Some fish species are equipped with ß- 1, 3 glucanases (or laminarinases) generally secreted by their own intestinal mucosa, and are thus able to take part in the biodegradation of ß- 1, 3 glucans such as laminarin, <b>leucosin,</b> paramylon, etc. On the contrary, fishes seem to be entirely unable to digest cellulose and thus can hardly play any role in the biogeochemical cycling of this important organic compound...|$|E
40|$|The cytoplasmic fine {{structure}} of the motile, pennate diatom, Nitzschia palea was studied in thin sections viewed in the electron microscope. The cells were fixed in OsO 4, embedded in methacrylate, and immersed in 10 per cent hydrofluoric acid (HF) for 36 to 40 hours to remove the siliceous cell wall prior to sectioning. The HF treatment did not cause any obvious cytoplasmic damage. The dictyosome complex is perinuclear, and located only in the central cytoplasm. Mitochondria are sparse in the central cytoplasm, but abundant in the peripheral cytoplasm, and fill many of the transvacuolar cytoplasmic strands. Characteristic, amorphous oil bodies fill certain cytoplasmic strands and probably are not <b>leucosin.</b> The pyrenoid appears to be membrane limited, and oil droplets are found adjacent to the pyrenoid. The pyrenoid of another diatom, Cymbella affinis, is also membrane-limited. The membrane limiting the pyrenoid may be a composite of the terminal portions of chloroplast discs, facilitating rapid movement of photosynthate into the pyrenoid matrix, where the characteristic oil droplets may be formed. Carinal fibrils are found singly in each carinal pore, and {{may be involved in}} the locomotion of Nitzschia palea...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: A revised taxonomic {{description}} of Phaeodactylum tricornutum Bohlin is presented, with {{special emphasis on}} the details of the silica valve, a structure hitherto unobserved. The features distinguishing P. tricornutum from Nitzschia closterium (Ehr.) W. Sm., with which it has frequently been confused, are summarized. In view of the unique characters of P. tricornutum, it is proposed to establish within the Bacillariales a new suborder, the Phaeodactylineae, to which Phaeoductylum is assigned as the only known genus. In 1897 Bohlin described a new genus of unicellular algae, Phaeodactylum, with a single species, P. tricornutum. The organism was stellate with three narrow arms, possessed yellow-brown chromatophores and was weakly silicified. On the basis of the chemical nature of the cells and their characteristic plane of division, parallel with that of the arms, Bohlin considered that P. tricornutum was closely related to the diatoms. Wilson (1946), in a study of the various cell forms of ‘ Nitxschia closterium W. Sm. forma minutissima ’, recognized the triradiate form of this organism as identical with P. tricornutum Bohlin. Since Hendey (1954) found no evidence for siliceous structures in the cell walls of this organism, he felt that it could not be classed as a diatom, and the pre-sence of <b>leucosin,</b> as shown by Parke (recorded by Hendey, 1954), suggested to him a possible relationship to the Chrysophyceae. On the basis of the absence of movement, the absence of a raphe, and the absence of siliceous structure, Bourrelly & Dragesco (1955) also concluded that P. tricornutum could not be regarded as a diatom, but was a ‘primitive Chrysococcalian’. Since the oval cells of P. tricornutum have now been shown to possess a silica valve (Lewin, Lewin & Philpott, 1958), it seems necessary to describe the organism more precisely on this basis, and to assign i t to an appropriate taxonomic position. Though the specific epithet tricornutum might appear inappropriate, having been based on an atypical form, it has to be retained according to the rules of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (Lanjouw et al. 1956) ...|$|E
