5000|$|While {{the action}} of the pole lathe and the skills {{required}} are similar to those employed on a modern power lathe, a requirement is that the timber used on a pole lathe is freshly felled and unseasoned, i.e., green. The angle that the tools are ground is closer to that of a carpenter's chisel than that of a power lathe tool. Using power <b>lathe</b> <b>tools</b> on a pole lathe is safe, but hard work. Using a pole lathe chisel on a power lathe risks serious injury, since the forces are such that the blade is likely to break.|$|E
50|$|Carbide is more {{expensive}} per unit than other typical tool materials, and it is more brittle, making it susceptible to chipping and breaking. To offset these problems, the carbide cutting tip itself is often {{in the form of}} a small insert for a larger tipped tool whose shank is made of another material, usually carbon tool steel. This gives the benefit of using carbide at the cutting interface without the high cost and brittleness of making the entire tool out of carbide. Most modern face mills use carbide inserts, as well as many <b>lathe</b> <b>tools</b> and endmills. In recent decades, though, solid-carbide endmills have also become more commonly used, wherever the application's characteristics make the pros (such as shorter cycle times) outweigh the cons (mentioned above).|$|E

Aiming at reducing the peak value of system frequency response, the dynamical vibration absorption system is optimized. The optimized frequency curve shows that the system frequency response is improved obviously. On this basis the influence of the mass of heavy turning body on the vibration system is discussed.

50|$|Safe {{usage of}} a lathe {{also depends on}} the operator's choice of proper {{techniques}} for the <b>lathe,</b> <b>tools,</b> and wood. For example, using a high spindle speed with an unbalanced wooden blank may cause the lathe to vibrate dangerously. Spinning a large turning blank too fast may cause it to explode. Inappropriate use of tools such as gouges and skew chisels can cause a catch, where the tool bites suddenly and aggressively into the wood in an uncontrolled manner. This exerts very large forces on the wood, the tool, the lathe and the operator, often causing the wood to break apart or tear free from the lathe. Lathe accidents often pull the tool out of the operator's hand and throw them in unexpected directions. Particular care is also required for wooden shapes that are not circular, such as off-center work, or bowls with wings or square rims. Portions of the turning extend farther from the axis of rotation, and are sometimes more difficult to see than {{the bulk of the}} wooden blank.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we shall discuss {{how to treat}} the {{automatic}} selection of appropriate <b>lathe</b> <b>tools</b> in a computer-aided production planning (CAPP) application as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) over hierarchically structured finite domains. Conceptually it is straightforward to formulate lathe-tool selection {{in terms of a}} CSP, however the choice of constraint and domain representations and of the order in which the constraints are applied is nontrivial if a computationally tractable system design is to be achieved. Since the domains appearing in technical applications often can be modeled as a hierarchy, we investigate how constraint satisfaction algorithms can make use of this hierarchical structure. Moreover, many real-life problems are formulated in a way that no optimal solution can be found which satisfies all the given constraints. Therefore, in order to bring AI technology into real-world applications, it becomes very important to be able to cope with conflicting constraints and to relax the given CSP until a (suboptimal) solution can be found. For these reasons, the constraint system CONTAX has been developed, which incorporates an extended hierarchical arc-consistency algorithm together with discrete constraint relaxation and has been used to implement the lathe-tool selection module of the ARC-TEC planning system...|$|E
