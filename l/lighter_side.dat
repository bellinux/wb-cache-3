25|$|Despite his adventurous career, mere reminiscences {{obviously}} bored him; he {{was always}} for movement, for some betterment of present or future conditions, and in discussion he was {{a master of the}} art of persuasion, unconsciously creating in those around him a latent desire to follow, if he would lead. The source of such persuasive influence eludes analysis, and, like the mystery of leadership, is probably more psychic than mental. In this latter respect, Jameson was splendidly equipped; he had greater power of concentration, of logical reasoning, and of rapid diagnosis, while on his <b>lighter</b> <b>side</b> he was brilliant in repartee and in the exercise of a badinage that was both cynical and personal...|$|E

Avery is stunned by Dylan's return, but remains in a relationship with Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). Burton noted the extreme differences between Dylan and Jason Morgan. The actor was able to have a new wardrobe and look. While Jason was confined and [...] "Stone Cold", Dylan has been credited by Burton as allowing him to portray his <b>lighter</b> <b>side</b> in addition to more of his own personality. The character was later paired with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan); their short-lived romance received negative reviews from viewers and critics alike.|$|E

500|$|Eccleston {{stated in}} April 2004 {{that he did}} not believe his Doctor would be [...] "as {{eccentric}} and as foppish as he was in some of his incarnations". Russell T Davies characterised the character as a [...] "stripped down" [...] version of previous Doctors. Regarding the Ninth Doctor's less eccentric character, Davies stated: [...] "He travels in time and space, he's got two hearts, he's a Time Lord— that's eccentric enough to be getting on with". In contrast with previous Doctors, the Ninth Doctor speaks with a distinct Northern accent. Remarking on this aspect of his characterisation Eccleston states that the character [...] "is a scientist and an intellectual, {{and a lot of people}} seem to think you can only be those things if you speak with received pronunciation which, of course, is rubbish." [...] In regards to the Doctor's costume, consisting of simply a black leather coat and dark trousers, Eccleston stated, [...] "I didn't want the costume to be my performance" [...] and that [...] "I wanted any flamboyance and colour to come out of my acting." [...] Eccleston thought that as the Doctor he should show a [...] "slight dark side" [...] but also bring out a <b>lighter</b> <b>side.</b> Executive producer Julie Gardner observed that the Ninth Doctor gave Eccleston the chance to be [...] "very intense but also frivolous as well." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} critical response {{ranging from}} extremely positive to extremely negative. Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave the episode five stars out of five, summarising {{it as an}} [...] "energetic romp that oozed with body horror that would make David Cronenberg proud" [...] which also [...] "infused a type of family melodrama commonly seen on soaps". He praised the [...] "stunningly bonkers" [...] plot noting that [...] "every potential dramatic and comedic moment that stemmed from Gwen's unconventional 'bun in the oven' scenario was fully maximised". He felt that in the central role [...] "Eve Myles delivered an outstanding performance as Gwen" [...] and also singled out the guest actors for praise, particularly Nerys Hughes. In an end of series review he listed [...] "Something Borrowed" [...] as his favourite episode of Torchwoods second series. Writing for The Stage, Mark Wright wrote that [...] "it’s good to see Torchwood can {{get in touch with}} its <b>lighter</b> <b>side</b> and not lose any momentum" [...] concluding [...] "I think I really might love this show". Jon Beresford of TV Scoop felt the episode {{to be one of the}} strongest of the second series. Whilst he felt it to be [...] "corny" [...] in places he summarised the episode as an [...] "exciting yarn with some really good performances from the team". He felt that Myles and Owen [...] "stole the show" [...] as Gwen and Rhys believing that [...] "there's a definite spark between these two that sets their moments apart." ...|$|E
500|$|To help {{train the}} dog playing Vincent for the episode's needed scenes, Madison {{was given the}} fake arm to take home and play with; when finally brought on the set, the crew had {{difficulty}} shooting her because Madison would bring and drop off the arm slightly differently each time, causing trouble recreating the same camera angles. Actor Daniel Dae Kim described their scenes with the beer in the DVD special features, [...] "The comedic scenes with Josh were {{so much fun to}} play because it was a <b>lighter</b> <b>side.</b> A nice change of pace." [...] Like their characters, the actors had not been in scenes together in a while, so Dae Kim thought it [...] "was fun to catch up and have fun in the process". The episode featured Hurley driving a bus down a hill. To create this scene, Garcia had to drive the bus down a small hill [...] "very stead" [...] to ensure the cameraman could record it all; towards the end however, they told Garcia to just [...] "go for it", allowing him to [...] "cut loose a little". For the close-up shots of Garcia and Dominic Monaghan, the production crew would shake the bus to simulate driving, and brush various pieces of foliage across the windshield to make it seem the bus was hitting bushes or trees. A stunt double standing in for Garcia performed the largest hill in the drive down; they were unable to rehearse due to getting rained out, so their first rehearsal was done on film. Dae Kim commented that [...] "it was just great to have as much fun on camera as we do off camera", {{and that there was no}} real acting that day, as they were all enjoying themselves as much as their characters. The Volkswagen campus van — still in operating condition — along with Hurley's Camaro, were later auctioned off with other Lost props and costumes at the Santa Monica Airport in 2010.|$|E

40|$|When etiolated radish (Raphanus sativus var. hortensis f. gigantissimus Makino) hypocotyls were {{subjected}} to a continuous unilateral illumination with white fluorescent light (0. 1 watt per square meter), the growth rate at the <b>lighted</b> <b>side</b> was strongly inhibited for the first 2 hours, while that at the shaded side showed no change. After 2. 5 hours growth on the <b>lighted</b> <b>side</b> recovered gradually, while that on the shaded side was slightly inhibited. The neutral growth inhibitors, cis- and trans-raphanusanins and raphanusamide, were determined in the <b>lighted</b> and shaded <b>sides</b> from 1 hour before until 2 hours {{after the start of}} unilateral illumination. In the <b>lighted</b> <b>side,</b> cis- and trans-raphanusanins increased by 0. 5 hour after the start of illumination, reached 3 to 3. 5 -fold greater concentrations than in the shaded side after 1 hour, and then decreased gradually. Raphanusamide increased in the <b>lighted</b> <b>side</b> to a 3 -fold greater concentration than that in the shaded one 2 hours after the start of the illumination. Unilateral applications of cis- and trans-raphanusanins and raphanusamide suppressed the growth of the hypocotyl on the applied side more than that on the opposite one, causing the hypocotyls to bend towards the site of application. The data suggest that phototropic curvature in radish is caused by the light-induced synthesis of growth-inhibiting cis- and trans-raphanusanins, and raphanusamide at the site of illumination...|$|R
