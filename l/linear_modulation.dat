50|$|Because {{satellite}} {{power is}} severely limited, analog video transmission through satellites differs from terrestrial TV transmission. AM is a <b>linear</b> <b>modulation</b> method, so a given demodulated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requires an equally high received RF SNR. The SNR of studio quality video is over 50 dB, so AM would require prohibitively high powers and/or large antennas.|$|E
50|$|When {{consecutive}} {{symbols are}} transmitted over a channel by a <b>linear</b> <b>modulation</b> (such as ASK, QAM, etc.), the impulse response (or equivalently the frequency response) {{of the channel}} causes a transmitted symbol to be spread in the time domain. This causes intersymbol interference because the previously transmitted symbols affect the currently received symbol, thus reducing tolerance for noise. The Nyquist theorem relates this time-domain condition to an equivalent frequency-domain condition.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} ways of {{demodulation}} depending on how parameters of the base-band signal such as amplitude, frequency or phase are transmitted in the carrier signal. For example, for a signal modulated with a <b>linear</b> <b>modulation</b> like AM (amplitude modulation), we can use a synchronous detector. On the other hand, for a signal modulated with an angular modulation, we must use an FM (frequency modulation) demodulator or a PM (phase modulation) demodulator.

The proposed timing estimator presents reduced implementation complexity and is obtained by performing an approximation on the Fourier series expansion of the conditional maximum likelihood function. The proposed algorithm is applied to <b>linear</b> <b>modulations</b> and two commonly used continuous phase modulations: minimum shift keying (MSK) and Gaussian MSK (GMSK). For the <b>linear</b> <b>modulations,</b> it is shown both analytically and via simulations that {{the performance of the}} proposed estimator is very close to the conditional CRB and modified CRB for signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in the range SNR 30 dB. Furthermore, the proposed estimator is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the classic square-law nonlinearity estimator under certain conditions. In the case of MSK and GMSK modulations, although the proposed algorithm reaches the conditional CRB at certain SNRs, however, the conditional CRB is quite far away from the modified CRB, and there exists an alternative algorithm whose performance comes closer to the modified CRB. Therefore, the proposed estimator is more suitable for <b>linear</b> <b>modulations</b> than for MSK and GMSK modulations.

40|$|Abstract: Orthogonal {{transmitter}} diversity such as {{frequency diversity}} and time diversity is quite simple to implement and, with optimum signal combining, can {{take full advantage}} of fading multipath channels. However, such a scheme has a bandwidth efficiency that decreases inversely with the number of diversity branches making it less attractive in wireless communications applications. This paper considers combined orthogonal transmitter diversity and multi-level <b>linear</b> <b>modulation</b> techniques. The idea is to view the signal constellations of the modulation scheme in an augmented signal space formed by the modulation signal dimension and the number of branches of the transmitter diversity scheme. This augmented signal space provides a good spread for the modulation signal points and can be quite efficient for high-level <b>linear</b> <b>modulation</b> techniques. The obtained results show that this combined scheme, not only improves the system performance in both additive white Gaussian noise and fading multipath channels, but also improves the bandwidth efficiency of orthogonal transmitter diversity. Key words: Orthogonal transmitter diversity, multi-level <b>linear</b> <b>modulation,</b> diversity gain, bandwidth efficiency, wireless communications. ...|$|E
