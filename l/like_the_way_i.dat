[...] "It was overtly sexual and very fantasy-like, with playing chicken and things that kids didn't really do," [...] Lucas explained. [...] "I wanted something that was more <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> grew up." [...] Walter's script also had Steve and Laurie going to Nevada to get married without their parents' permission. Walter rewrote the screenplay, but Lucas nevertheless fired him due to their creative differences.|$|E

They were very unhappy with it. They didn't like the cast. They didn't <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> was shooting it. I was always on the verge of getting fired." [...] When word of this reached Brando, he threatened to walk off the picture, writing in his memoir, [...] "I strongly believe that directors are entitled to independence and freedom to realize their vision, though Francis left the characterizations in our hands and we had to figure out what to do." [...] In a 2010 television interview with Larry King, Al Pacino also talked about how Brando's support helped him keep the role of Michael Corleone in the movie—despite the fact Coppola wanted to fire him. Brando was on his best behavior during filming, buoyed by a cast that included Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton. In the Vanity Fair article [...] "The Godfather Wars", Mark Seals writes, [...] "With the actors, as in the movie, Brando served as the head of the family. He broke the ice by toasting the group with a glass of wine. 'When we were young, Brando was like the godfather of actors,' says Robert Duvall. 'I used to meet with Dustin Hoffman in Cromwell's Drugstore, and if we mentioned his name once, we mentioned it 25 times in a day.' Caan adds, 'The first day we met Brando everybody was in awe.'" ...|$|E

[...] "I imagine we ran through a 12-bar or two and possibly they tried me out {{on one of the}} numbers from their set, but anyway they <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> fitted in and I joined them that day". Jennings' previous musical experience included blues gigs playing 12-string guitar in tandem with ex-Paramounts pianist Andy Staines, and (in 1968-69) White Rabbit with drummer Ron Berg and guitarist Andy Rickell (a.k.a. Android Funnel). After White Rabbit came to an end, Jennings played with several short-lived bands.|$|R

5000|$|Burns was {{initially}} {{influenced by the}} music of Sonny Boy Williamson I and Big Bill Broonzy. He relocated from the Mississippi Delta via Waterloo, Iowa, to Detroit in 1948. Originally Burns excelled at playing the harmonica, and his debut single, [...] "Notoriety Woman" [...] (1948), featured this ability accompanied by the guitar playing of John T. Smith. Burns told of meeting John Lee Hooker there: [...] "Well see, John T. and me was playing at a house party this particular Saturday night. We was in Detroit Black Bottom. ... so Hooker {{was on his way}} home from somewhere - I guess he was at some other party, house parties used to be real plentiful here. Hooker heard it, knocked at the door, and they let him in. He introduced himself and he sat down and played some with us. And then, he <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> was blowing harmonica. ... he had a session coming up on Tuesday, this was on a Saturday. And so then, he wanted to know if I wanted to do this session with him on Tuesday. And I told him, yes, naturally. So that's how John T. and me went down to cut for Hooker. When we got through the man wanted to know what I had. I had one song, 'Notoriety Woman.' And so he said I'd need two, and I sat there and made up 'Papa's Boogie.'" [...] By the following year Burns was playing guitar accompaniment on recordings by Hooker.|$|R
