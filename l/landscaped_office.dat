In this paper the indoor environment of the naturally ventilated Renson <b>landscaped</b> <b>office,</b> that is in use for ten years now, is measured and analysed according to the EN 15251 for parameters like (local) thermal comfort, indoor air quality, humidity, lighting and noise. Overall, one can see that -even though the occupation level is doubled in ten years and exceeds the planned occupation level- more than 75 % of time the limits of category I are fulfilled. Only for CO 2 {{this is not the}} case, due to the high occupation level. Nevertheless occurrence in category III is limited to 24 %. Category IV is never reached.

40|$|As {{the saying}} goes, to {{understand}} where you’re going, you must understand where you’ve been. Historians have variously linked the development of modern offices with the railroad industry, stock trading, insurance and finance, or government. Railroads had an impact, for example, as clerks became necessary for processing contracts governing the distribution of goods by rail. These early offices tended to be vast rooms containing {{row after row of}} free-standing desks, with only a few private offices for a sparse management layer. Thus, status-based distinctions concerning privacy and space accompanied the earliest instances of corporate offices. As more and more service industries grew to support this vast rail network and supplement the growing manufacturing sector, more managers needing office space joined the workforce. Essentially, only four developments have significantly altered these earliest office environments from the occupants ’ perspective: 1. The invention of the elevator 2. The first evolution of the open-plan office, known as the Bürolandshaft (or office landscape) movement, which began in the 1950 s in Germany 3. Bob Propst’s concept of an office supporting changing work conditions with modular components, circa 1960 s, designed to increase productivity, provide individual space, and increase privacy—the cubicle is a pared-down version of this view of the office 4. Ergonomic developments The elevator and advances in building materials allowed the development of skyscrapers, and the <b>landscaped</b> <b>office</b> concept addressed most of the concerns behind the current green movement. Unfortunately, the landscaped and modular-component approaches to offices were almost immediately corrupted to support technology and save space. In large measure, the white-collar factory metaphor for offices remains with us into the 21 st century. Even the otherwise useful discipline of ergonomics has retained a “machine metaphor ” for assessing office occupants, although its subfields of macroergonomics and hedonomics have provided helpful, broader perspectives (Brand, 2008) ...|$|E

40|$|This chapter explores {{communication}} {{patterns and}} media choices among employees, {{as well as}} their connection with the ongoing changes in workplace design. It presents a multiple case study of communication and co-ordination in open <b>landscape</b> <b>office</b> environments. The study was carried out in three different organisations; an advertising firm, a manufacturing business, and an IT development office. In the organisations the work practice was to some degree dependent on possibilities to communicate from various locations among co-workers, both within and outside the office. This paper suggests that utilising more personalised and effective communication media could provide necessary means for more efficient support of co-operative work. The issues of interaction space analysis and large-scale design, i. e. integration with the existing installed base of services and infrastructures, both technical and social, were here put into focus as influencing factors. To Trevino et al’s (1990) three factors I have added a forth factor, namely company culture that I believe has a great influence on employee’s media choices. The conclusions were that the organisational culture had deep impact on how the technology features were accepted and incorporated in the work practice for communication purposes...|$|R
40|$|A {{free access}} {{internet}} tool {{has been designed}} for architects. The objective is to give them knowledge about passive free cooling and active slab cooling strategies and convince them to study those further in their projects. The software, called “alter-CLIM”, {{is based on a}} transient simulation database build with Trnsys 16. Simulations determine thermal comfort and energy consumption for various architectures and system designs. Investigated parameters are glazing surface, shading devices, lighting control, thermal mass, orientation, hygienic air flow, free cooling management and implementation (without or with complementary mechanical cooling : hybrid solutions). Various room destinations, such as individual or <b>landscape</b> <b>offices,</b> hotel rooms and meeting rooms are studied. New build and renovations cases are taken into account. The software is easy to handle in order to become an often used tool by architects or engineers. Thanks to the comparison of various strategies’ performances, alter-CLIM helps to choose thermal control strategies in early design stages and to modify architecture in order to achieve thermal comfort and energy savings. The starting point of alter-CLIM’s message is that architectural design and design of systems have to be determined simultaneously. The author believes this starting point is a condition to reach sustainable design...|$|R
40|$|Air {{conditioning}} {{in offices}} has become current practice in North Western Europe. Main reasons are the high internal loads and solar gains. That {{move away from}} the heated, naturally ventilated cellular office increased comfort complaints. Two cases are presented, confronting enquiry results with measurements. In both, the enquiries gave a number of dissatisfied at the noted mean vote much higher than the standard PMV/PPD curve suggests. Measurements in turn showed that only in one of the two case complaints could be expected. A relationship between the severity of the complaints and the measured data was not traceable. To explain these results, several hypotheses were forwarded. The thermal environment in large <b>landscape</b> <b>offices</b> for example is not uniform. Different people also interpret thermal sensation on a scale from- 3 to + 3 differently. That has an impact on the number of dissatisfied. Further-on, the standard curve results from thousands of comfort tests, while on site inquiries concern smaller numbers of people, which expect improvement from the comfort study. For that reason they may exaggerate when enquired. And, finally, alternative PMV versus PPD curves, published in literature, show more people complaining at a given predicted mean vote than the standard curve suggests...|$|R

40|$|Demand {{controlled}} ventilation (DCV) {{refers to}} a ventilation system with air flow rates that are controlled based on a measurement of an indoor air quality (IAQ) and/or thermal comfort parameter. DCV operates at reduced air flow rates during {{a large amount of}} the operation time. Due to this decrease, less energy is needed for fan operation and heating/cooling the supply air. However, uncertainty still exists about the IAQ performance and ventilation efficiency in the room, especially at lower air flow rates. Aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the IAQ performance, ventilation efficiency, operation and energy efficiency of DCV in school and office buildings based on measurement results. This research was done in cooperation with Flemish manufacturers of ventilation components, engineering offices designing HVAC and industrial federations. Four case studies with large and varying occupancy and with different use and ventilation systems are selected. First case study is a school building with natural air supply and mechanical extraction controlled by measured indoor CO 2 concentration. Second study consist of an educational building with lecture rooms. In this building balanced mechanical ventilation is controlled by CO 2 and temperature measured at the extract air grill. Finally, in two different <b>office</b> buildings, three <b>landscaped</b> <b>offices</b> are evaluated. Here the balanced mechanical ventilation is controlled by CO 2 concentration and temperature. To evaluate IAQ, ventilation efficiency and the energy savings of the system, the following parameters are monitored: CO 2 concentrations and air? temperatures at different positions in the room and at the extract air grill, position of the variable air volume (VAV) boxes, supply and extract air flow rates and the occupancy of the room. Measurements lasted for at least two typical weeks in autumn and winter 2015 - 2016. The results show that a DCV system is able to guarantee a good IAQ in all the studied cases even at reduced air flow rates. The VAV boxes react well to predefined set points for CO 2 concentration The effect of the reduced air flow on the ventilation efficiency is negligible. Moreover, during the measurement period, the reduction of the fan energy ranges from 25 - 55 % compared to a constant air volume system (CAV). For the heat losses, the reduction was 25 - 32 % compared to a CAV during the measurement period. Energy reductions of both the fan and heat losses are calculated according to a design airflow rate of 29 m 3 /h. pers, i. e., IDA 3 in EN 13779. However, commissioning of the DCV is necessary to maintain these high energy reductions and good IAQ and ventilation efficiency. To conclude, DCV is an interesting ventilation system in rooms with a large and varying occupancy such as lecture rooms and <b>landscaped</b> <b>offices.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Natural night {{ventilation}} {{is driven}} by wind and stack generated pressures and cools down the exposed building structure at night, in which {{the heat of the}} previous day is accumulated. This passive cooling technique is applied in the low energy police office Schoten (Belgium). Thermal summer comfort in the offices is analysed based on the adaptive temperature limits indicator. Design, operation and performance of natural night ventilation are also evaluated. The design is compared to design guidelines for natural night ventilation. The operation is evaluated by comparing measured opening/closing of the windows to the designed control system. The performance is analysed based on the achieved temperature drop overnight. Measured data of indoor temperatures and opening/closing of windows were collected from the building management system during short periods in the summers of 2009 and 2010. Good thermal summer comfort is noticed during normal and warm summer periods. Only when the maximum outdoor temperature exceeds 30 °C, high indoor temperatures are measured. Too low temperatures in the morning are noticed in some <b>landscaped</b> <b>offices</b> in normal summer periods. This can be solved by raising the set point for indoor temperature. The users have a large impact on the achieved thermal comfort by manual opening and closing of the windows by day. A rather good agreement is found between measured and designed operation of natural ventilation. Daytime activation requirements have to be checked.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a parametric study about daylight autonomy and electric lighting consumption {{in a typical}} open-plan (<b>landscape)</b> <b>office</b> space located at high latitude. The parameters studied include: furniture, climates and latitude, orientations, glazing-to-wall ratios (GWR), Venetian blind use and electric lighting control systems. The study is carried out using DAYSIM, {{which is based on}} the validated backward raytracing simulation program RADIANCE. The results indicate that the furniture can significantly reduce daylight autonomy, especially at the back of a deep room, and this parameter must therefore be considered seriously in future simulation work. Furthermore, the results show that daylight autonomy is good to excellent in Stockholm-Östersund and good in Kiruna for work stations next to the window, even on North facades. The North façade has the advantage of no direct sunlight glare compared to South. However, daylight autonomy is much more limited on the North orientation for work stations located a few meters away from the window, which suggests that deep open-plan offices with North orientation should generally be avoided. An examination of electric lighting pattern use confirmed results of earlier studies i. e. the selection of control strategy for the electric lighting system {{is more important than the}} selection of GWR and that the occupancy switch on/off system yields the highest energy use while a perfectly commissioned photoelectric dimming system can achieve very significant energy savings for all GWR, orientations and climates, compared to a manual switch at the door...|$|R

5000|$|The belated {{urbanization}} of the quartier (after 1840), {{together with}} the availability of land, led to a great architectural diversity. The residential areas are composed of buildings of all styles. There is no great number of Haussmanian edifices, the quartier having largely been untouched by Second French Empire urban redevelopment. They are mostly found by the town hall and on Rue Alésia. Entirely Haussmanian streets, like Rue du Lunain, are rather rare. Façades in plaster are more common, testifying to the working class past of the quartier. Buildings of the 1930s are more present in the south, particularly in the ancient zone of fortifications. Finally the post-war architecture is also well represented, for better and for worse. One {{of the characteristics of}} the quartier is the importance of the individual home. Many plots were built only in façade, leaving the place for city houses or artists' workshops, often adorned with private gardens, invisible from the street. This type of construction is also found in the dead end streets (the [...] "villas"), occasionally with real architectural treasures. Certain streets, like Rue Bezout, form an authentic architectural museum offering to the visitor a variety of styles, sizes, eras of construction, and volumes.
