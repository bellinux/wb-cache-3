500|$|Jepsen's second studio {{album was}} {{initially}} {{planned to be}} released on February 14, 2012; however, she chose not to release it {{because she wanted to}} make sure she [...] "got the second CD right. I think I got a <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> the idea of the sophomore being a little less-than because it's so rushed. So I wanted to give myself the time to not feel that pressure." [...] She then worked with songwriter Josh Ramsay and producer Ryan Stewart on most of the album's tracks. Jepsen's songwriting process was inspired by her life and friends. After the recording sessions were completed, Curiosity was announced as a full-length album, with a digital release date confirmed for February 14, 2012. A few days before its official release, however, the label decided to change the format of the album, turning it into an extended play. The songs cut from the album [...] "Lost and Found", [...] "Alice In Wonderland", [...] "Dear Julian", [...] "Europe" [...] and [...] "Angels" [...] came to have their preview on iTunes Canada, before having changed album to EP.|$|E

5000|$|On October 22, 2016, {{it became}} known that {{in the midst of}} his tour in Germany, the Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela, gave an {{interview}} to the journalist Jenny Pérez, on the television network Deutsche Welle, where several topics were talked about, among them the scandal of the [...] "misnamed" [...] Panama Papers. The president took several minutes to say that there has been [...] "progress" [...] in transparency and have signed many agreements to exchange tax information and that tax evasion is a global problem and not just Panama's. Varela was losing the serenity that he had when starting the interview, as the journalist questioned about the scandal, he even was a <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> when asked <b>about</b> the link he has with Ramón Fonseca Mora, managing partner of the firm Mossack-Fonseca and recognized it's his friend.|$|R
5000|$|Cher Lloyd {{spoke about}} the tour in an {{interview}} with Artistdirect.She said, [...] "I really wanted to make it intimate. I want fans to feel like they're almost on stage with me.

I'm a <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> because they obviously haven't been released yet. No one has the actual recordings. Tonight, for the first time, I'm going to be performing them live. I understand they're going to get put on the internet. I'm <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> it Laughs. They're getting a preview of the album, and it's live. I'd better do it well!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, well!" [...] {{said the}} good-natured old man. [...] "Perhaps I'll come after you, some day soon. But I {{must go back}} now.

But it'll be quite easy to come, as soon as I've completed my new invention--for carrying one's-self, you know. It wants {{just a little more}} working out." ...|$|E
60|$|I took {{advantage}} of her newly-aroused confidence in me to observe her face, with an attention and a curiosity which I had hitherto restrained myself from showing, for caution's sake. I looked at her, with my mind full of that other lovely face which had so ominously recalled her to my memory on the terrace by moonlight. I had seen Anne Catherick's likeness in Miss Fairlie. I now saw Miss Fairlie's likeness in Anne Catherick--saw {{it all the more}} clearly because the points of dissimilarity between the two were presented to me as well as the points of resemblance. In the general outline of the countenance and general proportion of the features--in the colour of the hair and in the <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> uncertainty <b>about</b> the lips--in the height and size of the figure, and the carriage of the head and body, the likeness appeared even more startling than I had ever felt it to be yet. But there the resemblance ended, and the dissimilarity, in details, began. The delicate beauty of Miss Fairlie's complexion, the transparent clearness of her eyes, the smooth purity of her skin, the tender bloom of colour on her lips, were all missing from the worn weary face that was now turned towards mine. Although I hated myself even for thinking such a thing, still, while I looked at the woman before me, the idea would force itself into my mind that one sad change, in the future, was all that was wanting to make the likeness complete, which I now saw to be so imperfect in detail. If ever sorrow and suffering set their profaning marks on the youth and beauty of Miss Fairlie's face, then, and then only, Anne Catherick and she would be the twin-sisters of chance resemblance, the living reflections of one another.|$|R

6000|$|So Alice began {{telling them}} her adventures {{from the time}} when she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went on. Her {{listeners}} were perfectly quiet till {{she got to the}} part about her repeating 'YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said 'That's very curious.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was very}} intent {{to do the}} thing that was {{expected}} of him. His nerves and muscles were quivering, his mind was perhaps a little confused, but he felt neither fear nor anger. His hand that had been trodden upon throbbed and was hot. He was a <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> his bearing. He knew he was not afraid, but he was anxious not to seem afraid. In his former life he had often been more excited in playing games of skill. He was desirous of immediate action, he knew he must not think too much in detail of the huge complexity of the struggle about him lest be should be paralysed by the sense of its intricacy.|$|E
60|$|And {{so it was}} indeed: she was {{now only}} ten inches high, and her face brightened up {{at the thought that}} she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see {{if she was going to}} shrink any further: she felt a <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> this; 'for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not {{remember}} ever having seen such a thing.|$|E

6000|$|We tried {{all sorts}} of subjects, but they dropped one after the other. The elder gentlemen seemed {{to be afraid of}} {{committing}} themselves by talking too freely within hearing of us juniors, and we, on our side, restrained our youthful flow of spirits and youthful freedom of conversation out of deference to our host, who seemed once or twice to be feeling a <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> the continued propriety of our behavior in the presence of his respectable guests. To make matters worse, we had dined at a sensible hour. When the bottles made their first round at dessert, the clock on the mantel-piece only struck eight. I counted the strokes, and felt certain, from the expression of his face, that the other junior guest, who sat on one side of me at the round table, was counting them also. When we came to the final eight, we exchanged looks of despair. [...] "Two hours more of this! What on earth is to become of us?" [...] In the language of the eyes, that was exactly what we said to each other.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Polly, undeterred by a {{sense of}} grave damage done to his nose, pressed the attack in front, the two young men in violet and blue skirmished on Uncle Jim's flanks, the man in white and black checks sought still further {{outflanking}} possibilities, and two of the apprentice boys ran for oars. The gold-spectacled gentleman, as if inspired, came down the wooden steps again, seized the tablecloth of the jam and egg party, lugged it from under the crockery with inadequate precautions against breakage, and advanced with compressed lips, curious lateral crouching movements, swift flashings of his glasses, and a general suggestion of bull-fighting in his pose and gestures. Uncle Jim was kept busy, and unable to plan his retreat with any strategic soundness. He was moreover manifestly a <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> the river in his rear. He gave ground in a curve, and so came right across the rapidly abandoned camp of the family in mourning, crunching a teacup under his heel, oversetting the teapot, and finally tripping backwards over the hamper. The eel flew out at a tangent from his hand and became a mere looping relic on the sward.|$|E
6000|$|I {{marked the}} {{absent-minded}} scream, [...] The <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> trick [...] Of {{rolling in the}} grate, with eyes [...] By friendship's light made quick.|$|R

6000|$|... "I'll {{ask them}} to move it, if you wish," [...] {{returned}} Elsie, and when Jennie came in she said: [...] "Aren't you a <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> to-night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|It was so indeed: she was {{now only}} ten inches high, and her face brightened up as it {{occurred}} to her that {{she was now}} the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see whether she was going to shrink any further: she felt a <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> this, [...] "for it might end, you know," [...] said Alice to herself, [...] "in my going out altogether, like a candle, and what should I be like then, I wonder?" [...] and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember having ever seen one. However, nothing more happened so she decided on going into the garden at once, but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for the key, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it plainly enough through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery, and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.|$|E
60|$|She {{felt very}} slender and young and rather unclothed about {{the arms and}} neck, {{in spite of the}} six hundred pound pearl {{necklace}} that had been given to her just as she stood before the mirror in her white-and-gold dinner dress ready to start. She had to look down at that dress ever and again and at her shining arms to remind herself that she wasn't still in schoolgirl clothes, and it seemed to her there was not another woman in the room who was not fairly entitled to send her off to bed at any moment. She had been a <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> the details of the dinner, but there was nothing strange or difficult but caviare, and in that case she waited for some one else to begin. The Chartersons were there, which was very reassuring, and the abundant flowers on the table were a sort of protection. The man on her right was very nice, gently voluble, and evidently quite deaf, so that she had merely to make kind respectful faces at him. He talked to her most of the time, and described the peasant costumes in Marken and Walcheren. And Mr. Blenker, with a fine appreciation of Sir Isaac's watchful temperament and his own magnetism, spoke to her three times and never looked at her once all through the entertainment.|$|E
6000|$|The season {{happened}} to be unusually favourable; so mild a winter had not been known in the Baltic for many years. When Nelson joined the fleet at Yarmouth, he found the admiral [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> dark nights and fields of ice." [...] "But we must brace up," [...] said he; [...] "these are not times for nervous systems. I hope we shall give our northern enemies that hailstorm of bullets which gives our dear country the dominion of the sea. We have it, and all the devils in the north cannot take it from us, if our wooden walls have fair play." [...] Before the fleet left Yarmouth, it was sufficiently known that its destination was against Denmark. Some Danes, who belonged to the AMAZON frigate, went to Captain Riou, and telling him what they had heard, begged {{that he would get}} them exchanged into a ship bound on some other destination. [...] "They had no wish," [...] they said, [...] "to quit the British service; but they entreated that they might not be forced to fight against their own country." [...] There was not in our whole navy a man who had a higher and more chivalrous sense of duty than Riou. Tears came into his eyes while the men were speaking. Without making any reply, he instantly ordered his boat, and did not return to the AMAZON till he could tell them that their wish was effected. The fleet sailed on the 12th of March. Mr. Vansittart sailed in it; the British Cabinet still hoping to attain its end by negotiation. It was well for England that Sir Hyde Parker placed a fuller confidence in Nelson than the government seems to have done at this most important crisis. Her enemies might well have been astonished at learning that any other man should for a moment have been thought of for the command. But so little deference was paid, even at this time, to his intuitive and all-commanding genius, that when the fleet had reached its first rendezvous, at the entrance of the Cattegat, he had received no official communication whatever of the intended operations. His own mind had been made up upon them with its accustomed decision. [...] "All I have gathered of our first plans," [...] said he, [...] "I disapprove most exceedingly. Honour may arise from them; good cannot. I hear we are likely to anchor outside of Cronenburgh Castle, instead of Copenhagen, which would give weight to our negotiation. A Danish minister would think twice before he would put his name to war with England, when the next moment he would probably see his master's fleet in flames, and his capital in ruins. The Dane should see our flag every moment he lifted up his head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good heavens," [...] said Mr Montmorency, jumping up, [...] "I {{really feel}} a <b>little</b> <b>nervous.</b> I'll go and see." [...] And {{he ran out}} of the room.|$|R
60|$|The Assistant Commissioner, {{who could}} not see them, grew a <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> in the interval. But the great man {{presented}} to him a calm and undismayed face.|$|R
60|$|His manner was {{far from}} {{encouraging}} and his face wore a severe expression. Altogether I felt a <b>little</b> <b>nervous.</b> But {{it had to be}} done, so I began.|$|R
