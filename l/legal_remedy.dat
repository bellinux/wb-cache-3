However, shortly thereafter, the Gibraltar Heritage Trust voted to drop its court case due to fears of the mounting legal costs.

500|$|While all {{advocates for}} {{elimination}} of Native mascots {{agree that the}} practice is morally wrong, many do not find a basis for <b>legal</b> <b>remedy.</b> Civil rights law in the United States reflect {{the difference between the}} experience of racism by African Americans and Native Americans. The effects of slavery continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The appropriation of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process. The difference is reflected in the continued popularity of Native Americans as mascots when similar usage of the names and images of any other ethnic group, in particular African Americans, would be unthinkable, and the continued claim that the stereotype of the [...] "noble savage" [...] honors Native Americans.|$|E
500|$|After {{averaging}} 17points {{per game}} as a rookie and more than 22per game in his second season, Howard became a free agent when the Bullets made some salary cap transactions. The Bullets offered Howard an $89million contract, but the Miami Heat outbid them with a seven-year deal estimated to be worth [...] $98 to $101million. However, according to the NBA league office, the Heat miscalculated their available salary under the salary cap by excluding performance bonuses for Tim Hardaway and P. J. Brown and failing {{to account for the}} impact of renegotiating Alonzo Mourning's contract before coming to terms with Howard. The league rejected the contract on July 31 because Howard's $9million for the 1996–97 season placed the Heat over the cap. Howard then re-signed with the Bullets on August 5. He became the first player in NBA history to sign a contract worth more than $100million; his seven-year contract was worth $105million. The league ruled on August 5 that the Bullets could re-sign Howard after having renounced his rights on July 15 to free up cap room to sign Tracy Murray and Lorenzo Williams if they forfeited their 1997 NBA draft first-round selection rights. The Bullets were not limited by the cap because they were re-signing their own player. The Heat pursued <b>legal</b> <b>remedy</b> in Florida state courts, seeking acknowledgment of the prior validity and superiority of their earlier contract. [...] Although an arbitration case involving the two contracts that Howard had signed appeared likely, ESPN reported that the Heat dropped their legal pursuit of Howard. The league moved for federal jurisdiction although the case remained on the docket for New York University law professor Daniel Collins to serve as arbitrator on three issues: [...] "1.) Did the Heat circumvent the cap in first signing Mourning?; 2.) Did the Heat miscalculate bonus money for forward P. J. Brown and guard Tim Hardaway that was not counted correctly against the cap.?; 3.) Did the Heat add an illegal performance clause to Brown's contract?." [...] Meanwhile, the Heat's contract was protected by a temporary injunction in Florida state court, which forbade any newer contract by Howard from abrogating his Miami contract. The Heat eventually dropped their case but the team, especially head coach Pat Riley, continued to vehemently claim that their case of wrongdoing in the form of erroneous rulings by the league had been very solid. If the Heat had pursued arbitration and had been found guilty of violating the salary cap, the team could have been fined $5million and Heat coach Riley could have been suspended for the season. By dropping their actions, the Heat avoided any possible penalties. [...] In addition to signing free agents Murray and Williams, the Bullets traded for Rod Strickland and Harvey Grant.|$|E

40|$|The author {{analyses}} the <b>legal</b> <b>remedies</b> {{provided by}} the General Administrative Procedure Act of the Republic of Slovenia (GAPA, 1999), as the only legal instrument for the annulment or modification of an issued decision. Particular emphasis {{is given to the}} appeal, often used directly on a constitutional basis. In addition to pursuing the protection of the rights of the parties in administrative proceedings, the purpose of the appeal is to establish an internal administrative supervision of line ministries. The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess whether and to what extent certain <b>legal</b> <b>remedies</b> under the GAPA are effective in (Slovenian) practice compared to the goals of their regulation. In order to protect their position, parties should have the possibility of challenging the act both after the issue of the act at first instance as well as after it has become complete or even final and has the force of res iudicata. Challenging an act is possible only through <b>legal</b> <b>remedies</b> provided by law. The modification of decisions after their completeness (after the end of administrative proceedings) or even after finality (following an administrative dispute) is diminishing the level of trust in the legal system (i. e. legal certainty). Therefore the use of, in particular, extraordinary <b>legal</b> <b>remedies</b> have to be limited to the most essential errors in the procedure. <b>Legal</b> <b>remedies</b> are specified primarily by the GAPA, by type as well as by grounds, bodies, effects, characteristics (dispositiveness/officiality, non/suspensiveness, non/devolution, etc.), and time limits. The GAPA distinguishes between the use of <b>legal</b> <b>remedies</b> in connection to completeness of a decision (within the administrative procedure when the decision cannot be challenged (any more) by an appeal) and finality (after the administrative dispute regarding the review of legality of complete decisions is no longer possible). The author is therefore suggesting several amendments to the GAPA to achieve more successfully the goals of present <b>legal</b> <b>remedies</b> and the effectiveness of the administrative system as a whole, including the reduced caseload of the courts when the appeal system is successful in persuading the parties not to continue with the administrative dispute after the completeness of a decision within administrative proceedin g. appeal; effectiveness; administrative system; administrative procedure; legal remedies; legal certainty; legality...|$|R
