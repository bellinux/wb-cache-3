40|$|Abstract. Numerical {{modelling}} {{and experimental}} measurements {{led to the}} assessment of stress of structural nodes of scissor <b>lifting</b> <b>platform,</b> which is used for relocation of cars from a production line. It also led to the optimization of producing process. Immediate load of scissor <b>lifting</b> <b>platform</b> by a car on stand causes additional bending moment that must be captured in a scissor mechanism. At the beginning the experimental measurements on the real <b>lifting</b> <b>platform</b> were made for obtaining of dependence of displacement, velocity and acceleration on time, which was almost 1. 5 ± 0. 1 g. Then a dynamical analysis of <b>lifting</b> <b>platform</b> was performed using the numerical method Runge Kutta 4 th order. Model analysis showed that the initial immediate acceleration of <b>lifting</b> <b>platform</b> at start and immediate deceleration at stop lead to dynamic shocks. These dynamic shocks are dangerous due to a long term operation because they permanently load not only pivots but also other parts – bearings and joining parts. A resonance may occur as well. In particular, dynamic shocks caused damage of structural nodes. Immediate load of scissor <b>lifting</b> <b>platform</b> by a car on stand causes additional bending moment. It is not appropriate {{in terms of a}} long-term operation. The recommended load <b>lifting</b> <b>platform</b> should be symmetrical...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} a vision-based control {{approach}} for autonomously docking a wheelchair onto a vehicle <b>lift</b> <b>platform.</b> This is a principle component of the Automated Transport and Retrieval System (ATRS) - an alternate mobility solution for drivers with lower body disabilities. The ATRS employs robotics, automation, and machine vision technologies, and can be integrated into a standard minivan or sport utility vehicle (SUV). At {{the core of the}} ATRS is a “smart ” wheelchair system that autonomously navigates between the driver’s position and a powered lift {{at the rear of the}} vehicle- eliminating the need for an attendant. From an automation perspective, autonomously docking the wheelchair onto the <b>lift</b> <b>platform</b> presented the most significant technical challenge for the proof-of-concept ATRS. This was driven primarily by geometry constraints, which limited clearance between the chair wheels and the <b>lift</b> <b>platform</b> rails. We present significant simulation and experimental results for our approach. These indicate that the coupling of visionbased localization for feedback and input/output feedback linearization techniques for controller design can provide for accurate wheelchair navigation and reliable docking under a range of ambient illumination conditions.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} the Automated Transport and Retrieval System (ATRS). ATRS {{represents}} {{an alternative to}} van conversions for automobile drivers with lower body disabilities.

40|$|This article {{describes}} an unprecedented alternative to manual {{procedures for the}} application of advanced composite materials, such as Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) and epoxy resins. A complete mobile integrated system is presented for the inspection and maintenance of concrete surfaces in tunnels. It allows performance of operations with minimum interference on passing traffic. The core of this system resides in a specially designed light-weight robotic tool, which is sensed and automated for processes. Sensing includes vision and a laser telemeter to assure precise inspection, superficial preparation, and composite application. The designed interconnection flange allows simple and robust attachment of the tool to a robotic arm's tip. The robot&-tool set is to be mounted on a standard articulated <b>lift</b> <b>platform.</b> Therefore, an operator can direct the platform and the robot&-tool set's operations from a control station placed at ground-level, in a wheeled vehicle on which the articulated <b>lift</b> <b>platform</b> is mounted.
