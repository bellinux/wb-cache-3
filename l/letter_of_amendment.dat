40|$|Abstract: Thesis {{is divided}} into three parts. The first part {{introduces}} the task based-layer teaching five steps instructional design of English Business Correspondence in Business School of the Vocational Technology. The five-step design develops on the basis of traditional pre task, task and review, the tree-step teaching model, taking into account of the poor English of students in Vocational school, we add preparing lessons before class and exercising to consolidate after class the two rings. So the five-step is preview before class [...] - pre task: the situation creation, case introduction, leads to the task [...] - task: discuss a writing program, task decomposition, first attempt to writing step by step, later attempt to writing comprehensively [...] after task: Showing, evaluation and learning model essay, self correction, after class: practicing, consolidating and improving. This design not only embodies the characteristics of task-based teaching, also shows the ideas and methods of hierarchical interactive teaching. In {{the second part of the}} paper, it gives the specific design of each step e of the task based- layer teaching in detail, taking the example of how to write the <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendment</b> to the L/C, which clearly tells us how to carry out the whole process of five-step teaching. The third part introduces the writer's reflection of implementation of the task based- laye...|$|E
50|$|By the mid-1920s, Wadsworth {{was one of}} {{a handful}} of congressmen who spoke out forcefully and {{frequently}} against prohibition. He was especially concerned that citizens could be prosecuted by both state and federal officials for a single violation of prohibition law. This seemed to him to constitute double jeopardy, inconsistent with the spirit if not the <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> the Fifth <b>Amendment.</b> The Fifth Amendment in criminal cases prevents two trials for the same offense in the same level of court, not two trials for the same charge in separate state and national jurisdictions.|$|R

40|$|Substantial {{empirical}} evidence indicates properties across the United States that are located within a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) sell {{at a discount}} compared to similar properties otherwise located. This result is also true in our sample. Researchers have suggested the price discount equals {{a combination of the}} present value of the required flood insurance premiums and the value of uninsurable costs. To identify the portion of the discount applicable to each component, analysts have been required to estimate applicable insurance premiums and to assume a discount rate. The present paper presents a methodology that does not require these prerequisites, but still enables separation of the discount into the two components. in the united states, {{the federal emergency management agency}} sometimes issues a <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> Map <b>Amendment</b> (LOMA), which exempts a property from the requirement that it be insured against flood damage as a prerequisite to the owner obtaining a federally-related mortgage loan. Therefore, any price difference between non-LOMA SFHA properties and similar properties outside the SFHA should continue to equal the sum of the two components and any significant price difference between SFHA properties with a LOMA and similar properties located outside the SFHA should equal the present value of the uninsurable costs only. Hedonic regression is used to test this proposal by comparing the selling prices of single-family house transactions for properties located within and outside the SFHA in Kettering, Ohio. In our sample, no significant uninsurable costs were detected...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{the global}} “War on Terror,” federal agents {{intentionally}} delay issuing Miranda warnings to terrorism suspects during custodial interrogations. They delay the warnings presuming that unwarned suspects will more freely offer vital national security intelligence. After a suspect offers the information he has, agents administer Miranda warnings and attempt to elicit confessions that prosecutors can use at the suspect’s trial. No court has ruled on the constitutionality of this two-step national security interrogation process to determine whether admitting the second, warned confession is allowed under Miranda v. Arizona and its progeny. A fragmented Supreme Court examined two-step interrogations generally in Missouri v. Seibert but offered no clear holding. This Note argues that while confessions derived from two-step national security interrogations are admissible under Justice Kennedy’s Seibert test, courts should instead apply Justice Souter’s Seibert test to limit {{the use of such}} interrogations. This Note further contends that permitting two-step national security interrogations contravenes the spirit, if not the <b>letter,</b> <b>of</b> the Fifth <b>Amendment</b> as well as decades of Miranda jurisprudence...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the {{drafting}} and operation of amending legislation {{in the light of}} two paradigms of statute law. Part One examines the paradigm which developed in Great Britain in the nineteenth century. That paradigm emphasized the fragmentary character of the statute law. Ilbert analysed the techniques <b>of</b> <b>amendment</b> and concluded in favour of the use <b>of</b> indirect <b>amendment</b> and against the use <b>of</b> textual <b>amendment.</b> Another paradigm <b>of</b> statute law developed in the United States, Canada and Australia in the nineteenth century. It emphasizes the potential coherence of the statute law and tries to realise this potential through statute revision and the use <b>of</b> textual <b>amendment.</b> The consequences <b>of</b> the use <b>of</b> textual <b>amendment</b> for the operation of amending enactments are examined. The thesis also considers the argument that the use of re-enactment as a technique <b>of</b> <b>amendment</b> is undesirable because it opens up for parliamentary <b>amendment</b> more <b>of</b> the act proposed to be amended than do other techniques <b>of</b> <b>amendment.</b> (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
