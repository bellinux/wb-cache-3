25|$|Genes {{encoding}} CYP enzymes, and the enzymes themselves, {{are designated}} with the root symbol CYP for the superfamily, {{followed by a}} number indicating the gene family, a capital letter indicating the subfamily, and another numeral for the individual gene. The convention is to italicise the name when referring to the gene. For example, CYP2E1 is the gene that encodes the enzyme CYP2E1—one of the enzymes involved in paracetamol (acetaminophen) metabolism. The CYP nomenclature is the official naming convention, although occasionally CYP450 or CYP450 is used synonymously. However, some gene or enzyme names for CYPs may differ from this nomenclature, denoting the catalytic activity {{and the name of}} the compound used as substrate. Examples include CYP5A1, thromboxane A2 synthase, abbreviated to TBXAS1 (ThromBoXane A2 Synthase 1), and CYP51A1, <b>lanosterol</b> 14-α-demethylase, sometimes unofficially abbreviated to LDM according to its substrate (<b>Lanosterol)</b> and activity (DeMethylation).|$|E
25|$|An {{elevated}} {{concentration of}} plasma cholesterol, especially low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, is now generally {{accepted as a}} major risk factor {{for the development of}} coronary heart disease. The objective is to decrease excess levels of cholesterol to an amount consistent with maintenance of normal body function. Cholesterol is biosynthesized in a series of more than 25 separate enzymatic reactions that initially involves three successive condensations of acetyl-CoA units to form the six-carbon compound 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA). This is reduced to mevalonate and then converted in a series of reactions to the isoprenes that are building-blocks of squalene, the immediate precursor to sterols, which cyclizes to <b>lanosterol</b> (a methylated sterol) and further metabolized to cholesterol. A number of early attempts to block the synthesis of cholesterol resulted in agents that inhibited late in the biosynthetic pathway between <b>lanosterol</b> and cholesterol. A major rate-limiting step in the pathway is {{at the level of the}} microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG CoA to mevalonic acid, and that has been considered to be a prime target for pharmacologic intervention for several years.|$|E
25|$|As an antifungal, {{ketoconazole}} is structurally {{similar to}} imidazole, and {{interferes with the}} fungal synthesis of ergosterol, a constituent of fungal cell membranes, as well as certain enzymes. As with all azole antifungal agents, ketoconazole works principally by inhibiting the enzyme cytochrome P450 14α-demethylase (CYP51A1). This enzyme participates in the sterol biosynthesis pathway that leads from <b>lanosterol</b> to ergosterol. Lower doses of fluconazole and itraconazole are required to kill fungi compared to ketoconazole, {{as they have been}} found to have a greater affinity for fungal cell membranes.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{cholesterol}} {{is essential}} for all animal life, each cell is capable of synthesizing it {{by way of a}} complex 37-step process, beginning with the mevalonate pathway and ending with a 19-step conversion of <b>lanosterol</b> to cholesterol. [...] Furthermore, it can be absorbed directly from animal-based foods.|$|E
2500|$|The {{commonly}} used azole class antifungal drugs work by inhibition of the fungal cytochrome P450 14α-demethylase.

2500|$|Yeasts are facultative anaerobes {{meaning that}} they can exist in both the {{presence}} and absence of oxygen. While fermentation is traditionally thought of as an [...] process done {{in the absence of}} oxygen, early exposure of the yeast to oxygen can be a vital component in the successful completion of that fermentation. This is because oxygen is important in the synthesis of cell [...] "survival factors" [...] such as ergosterol and <b>lanosterol.</b> These sterols are important in maintaining the selective permeability of the yeast cell membrane which becomes critical as the yeast becomes exposed to increasing osmotic pressure and levels of alcohol in the wine. As a waste product of its own metabolism, alcohol is actually very toxic to yeast cells. Yeast with weak survival factors and lacking sterols may succumb to these conditions before fermenting a wine to complete dryness, leaving a stuck fermentation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lanosterol</b> synthase is an oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) {{enzyme that}} {{converts}} (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene to a protosterol cation {{and finally to}} <b>lanosterol.</b> <b>Lanosterol</b> is a key four-ringed intermediate in cholesterol biosynthesis.

50|$|<b>Lanosterol</b> synthase inhibitors {{are thought}} to lower LDL and VLDL {{cholesterol}} by a dual control mechanism. Studies in which <b>lanosterol</b> synthase is partially inhibited have shown both a direct decrease in <b>lanosterol</b> formation {{and a decrease in}} HMG-CoA reductase activity. The oxysterol 24(S),25-epoxylanosterol, which is preferentially formed over <b>lanosterol</b> during partial <b>lanosterol</b> synthase inhibition, is believed to be responsible for this inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity.|$|E

It is formed when squalene is oxidized by the enzyme squalene monooxygenase. 2,3-Oxidosqualene is the substrate of various oxidosqualene cyclases, including <b>lanosterol</b> synthase, which produces <b>lanosterol,</b> a precursor to cholesterol.|$|E
50|$|Terconazole binds to the heme iron {{component}} on the cytochrome P450 enzyme <b>lanosterol</b> of fungi, {{also known}} as CYP3A4. The gene ERG11 controls <b>lanosterol</b> creation. <b>Lanosterol</b> is found within the yeast plasma membrane. It is a class of methylsterol. Within a normal yeast cell, <b>lanosterol</b> is demethylated using 14α-demethylation. This process creates zymosterol: a major constituent in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway {{for the creation of}} cell membrane constituents in yeast. This structure provides the membrane with fluidity. This occurs by transforming <b>lanosterol</b> into 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-β-ol. This stops respiration by prohibiting reduction of NADH to NAD. This stops biosynthesis of cell membrane products as well as transport and catabolism. Eventually, membrane fluidity and activity of membrane bound enzymes become depleted. It has also been shown to inhibit morphologic change of yeast as well as cell adherence and is directly toxic to yeast. Terconazole targets fungi specifically since humans do not use <b>lanosterol</b> in this pathway. This process does not affect all fungi such as Pneumocystis jirovecii, which lacks <b>lanosterol.</b>|$|E
