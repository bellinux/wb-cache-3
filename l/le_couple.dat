40|$|Ubiquinone (UQ) is a lipid-soluble {{electron}} carrier in {{the respiratory}} chain. It mediates electron transfer from NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I) to succinate dehydrogenase (Complex II) and {{further to the}} bc 1 complex (Complex III) at the inner mitochondrial membrane (1). In humans, cellular UQ contents, particularly in heart cells, peak at age 20 then decreases (2). UQ therefore has been efficacious as a medicine to improve heart function. UQ supplementation recently {{has been reported to}} have mild symptomatic benefits for patients with Alzheimer (3), Parkinson (4), and Huntington (5) diseases. Furthermore, food supplements and cosmetics that contain UQ as an antioxidative have become very popular in the world market. However, only little is known about its physiological role in planta. UQ is distributed in various compartments {{as well as in the}} mitochondria; the nucleus, plasma membrane, Golgi vesicles, and lysosomes, in which UQ is thought to function as an antioxidant (6) or an electron transporter (7). In yeast and arabidopsis, UQ biosynthesis is believed to take place in the mitochondria, but there are reports of UQ biosynthesis in such other subcellular areas as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus in both rat liver (8) and spinach (9). A key reaction step in UQ biosynthesis is the prenylation of p-hydroxybenzoate (PHS); <b>Le.,</b> <b>coupling</b> of the aromatic substrate and isoprenoid chain, which is presumed to be rate-limiting for UQ production (Fig. 1).
