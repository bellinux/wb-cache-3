This phenomenon is known as load transfer or weight transfer, depending on the author, and provides challenges and opportunities to both riders and designers. For example, motorcycle racers {{can use it to}} increase the friction available to the front tire when cornering, and attempts to reduce front suspension compression during heavy braking has spawned several motorcycle fork designs.|$|E
5000|$|A wheelie is {{imminent}} when the acceleration {{is sufficient to}} reduce the <b>load</b> <b>borne</b> by the front axle to zero. The conditions for this can be calculated with the so-called [...] "weight transfer equation":where [...] is the change in <b>load</b> <b>borne</b> by the front wheels, [...] is the longitudinal acceleration, [...] {{is the center of}} mass height, [...] is the wheelbase, and [...] is the total vehicle mass.|$|E
50|$|Applying {{the brakes}} of a moving {{motorcycle}} increases the <b>load</b> <b>borne</b> {{by the front}} wheel and decrease the <b>load</b> <b>borne</b> by the rear wheel due to a phenomenon called load transfer. For a detailed explanation and a sample calculation, see the braking section of the Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics article.If the motorcycle is equipped with telescopic forks, the added load on the front wheel is transmitted through the forks, which compress. This shortening of the forks causes {{the front end of}} the bike to move lower, and this is called brake dive. telescopic forks are particularly prone to this, unlike leading link designs.|$|E

50|$|The IIFS {{replaces the}} {{partially}} obsolete {{concept of a}} shoulder harness, {{in the style of}} suspenders, and individual equipment belt design, with the newer concept of a tactical load bearing system that employs a vest. The vest as being the main component, is known as the TLBV (Tactical <b>Load</b> <b>Bearing</b> Vest), sometimes referred to as the LBV-88, the M-1988 LBV and later known as the ETLBV (Enhanced Tactical <b>Load</b> <b>Bearing</b> Vest).|$|R
50|$|Weight {{transfer}} and load transfer are two expressions used somewhat confusingly to describe two distinct effects: {{the change in}} <b>load</b> <b>borne</b> by different wheels of even perfectly rigid vehicles during acceleration, and the change in center of mass (CoM) location relative to the wheels because of suspension compliance or cargo shifting or sloshing. In the automobile industry, weight transfer customarily refers to the change in <b>load</b> <b>borne</b> by different wheels during acceleration. This is more properly referred to as load transfer, {{and that is the}} expression used in the motorcycle industry, while weight transfer on motorcycles, to a lesser extent on automobiles, and cargo movement on either is due to a change in the CoM location relative to the wheels. This article uses this latter pair of definitions.|$|E
50|$|The term {{axle load}} is also {{applicable}} to trucks which {{is complicated by}} the fact that trucks may have more than two wheels per axle. In this case, the axle load remains the same, but the <b>load</b> <b>borne</b> by the individual wheels is reduced by having more wheels to distribute the load.|$|E
50|$|In wheeled vehicles, load {{transfer}} is the measurable change of <b>load</b> <b>borne</b> by different wheels during acceleration (both longitudinal and lateral). This includes braking, and deceleration (which is an acceleration at a negative rate).No {{motion of the}} center of mass relative to the wheels is necessary, and so {{load transfer}} may be experienced by vehicles with no suspension at all. Load transfer is a crucial concept in understanding vehicle dynamics. The same is true in bikes, though only longitudinally.|$|E

5000|$|One way to {{calculate}} the effect of load transfer, {{keeping in mind that}} this article uses [...] "load transfer" [...] to mean the phenomenon commonly referred to as [...] "weight transfer" [...] in the automotive world, is with the so-called [...] "weight transfer equation":where [...] is the change in <b>load</b> <b>borne</b> by the front wheels, [...] is the longitudinal acceleration, [...] is the center of mass height, [...] is the wheelbase, and [...] is the total vehicle mass.|$|E

5000|$|An {{equivalent}} expression, {{which does}} not require knowing the <b>load</b> <b>borne</b> by the front wheels nor the total vehicle mass, is for the minimum longitudinal acceleration required for a wheelie:where [...] is the acceleration due to gravity, [...] is the horizontal distance from the rear axle {{to the center of}} mass, and [...] is the vertical distance from the ground to the center of mass. Thus the minimum acceleration required is directly proportional to how far forward the center of mass is located and inversely proportional to how high it is located.|$|E

5000|$|A {{recent article}} {{has argued that}} the massive stones could be moved by {{submerging}} them in water and towing them below an ancient vessel or group of vessels. [...] This technique would have two significant advantages. It would reduce the <b>load</b> <b>borne</b> by the vessel while part of the stones weight is displaced by the water. Secondly, the arrangement of the load below the vessel would be much more stable and reduce the risk of catastrophic failure. Naturally, this would apply only for transportation over water. The technique was tried during the Millennium Stone Project 2000, with a single bluestone slung beneath two large curraghs. The sling frayed away, and the stone plunged to the bed of Milford Haven.|$|E

30|$|The {{percentage}} of bearing {{force at the}} TMJ was larger while the load was less than that exerted during occlusal adjustment, and vice versa.

Therefore, the <b>load</b> <b>borne</b> by the TMJ was {{not considered to be}} harmful in any case of occlusal adjustment or load because the occlusal force itself was kept comparatively small even if the percentage of the bearing load increased.|$|E
30|$|A wide strap design, {{approximately}} 4.5  cm in width, is {{more suitable}} for women with large breasts compared to the standard width (2.5  cm) or a gel strap design for sports bras, {{as evidenced by the}} strap preference and the bra strap pressure data. Participants consistently perceived that the wide straps better cushioned the <b>load</b> <b>borne</b> by the straps, which is logical considering the greater surface area over which to distribute the load generated at the bra strap-shoulder interface. This was also evident in the significantly lower mean static and dynamic mean peak pressure recordings in the wider bra strap conditions compared to the other strap conditions [29]. However, although the wide strap design had the lowest VAS scores, no significant difference was found in strap discomfort among the three strap designs, which may also be attributed to the short durations over which the straps were worn.|$|E

40|$|Background: Weight-shifting {{exercise}} was empirically practised in correcting the biased posture {{of people with}} stroke-induced hemiplegia. Objectives: (1) Evaluate the loading symmetry at the buttock-seat interface {{as a reflection of}} a postural defect in sitting. (2) Investigate if weight-shifting exercises could correct the postural problem of people with hemiplegia. Design: Control group design. Participants: 16 subjects with hemiplegia after stroke and 14 healthy individuals. Procedures: Subjects were assessed for buttock-seat interface loading while in erect sitting using a seat pressure mapping system. Subjects with stroke then practised one session of weight-shifting exercise followed by a reassessment. Results: The subjects with hemiplegia, particularly those with right hemisphere lesion, had more <b>load</b> <b>borne</b> at the buttock ipsilateral to the side of stroke lesion. The weight-shifting exercise did not produce an immediate improvement on the loading asymmetry. Conclusion: The exercise would require further investigation to clarify its benefits in treating postural problems after stroke. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|E
40|$|Cat {{papillary}} {{muscles were}} tetanized with repetitive electrical stimulation {{in the presence}} of 10 ITIM caffeine and 10 mM calcium. Velocities were measured during the plateau of tetanus with quick releases to isotonic loads. The course of isotonic shortening was independent of time in the contraction cycle for at least 2 seconds after the attainment of peak isometric force. The force-velocity relationships were measured at different muscle lengths that had been corrected for series elastic extension. These lengths ranged from 75 % to 90 % of the passive length from which maximum force was developed. The data were fitted by a least-squares method with hyperbolas described by the Hill equation, each for a constant corrected muscle length. The extrapolated maximum velocities and isometric forces diminished together in almost direct proportion to muscle shortening. Corrections for the <b>load</b> <b>borne</b> by the parallel elastic elements did not significantly change the relationships between isometric force, maximum velocity, and muscle length.
