40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{extensive}} {{studies on}} Lepidopterous insects associated with vegetables {{were conducted in}} different localities of Aravalli Range of Rajasthan i. e. Mount Abu, Udaipur, Rajsamand, Puskar, Ajmer, Jaipur, Sikar, Jhunjhunu, Sariska, Alwar, Dausa and Bharatpur during 2008 - 11. During present study 38 species of lepidopterous insects associated with vegetables in Aravalli Range of Rajasthan were recorded, out of 152 species of lepidopterous insects recorded from India. The families Crambidae and Noctuidae were the dominant families each represented by 8 species followed by Arctiidae having 4 species; Lycaenidae 3 species; then Nolidae, Pieridae and Sphingidae each having 2 species and least by Cosmopterigidae, Gelechiidae, Geometridae, Hesperiidae, Lymantriidae, Nymphalidae, Plutellidae, Pterophoridae and Saturniidae each having 1 species. On the basis of nature of damage the lepidopterous insects were also categorized as leaf feeders, pod borers, fruit borers, defoliators and <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers,</b> bud borers and leaf webbers, cut worms, leaf miners and stem borers etc. The salient details of their hosts, pest status or otherwise and their updated classification are provided...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in an apple orchard in the Central Balkan Mountains of Bulgaria, in 2006 and 2007. Mating disruption (MD) was tested as an alternative method for controlling codling moth (CM), Cydia pomonella L., from post-bloom till harvest. Ecodian CP (Isagro) pheromone dispensers were installed twice during the season. In the reference, conventionally treated orchard, 12 - 15 insecticide treatments were applied to control codling moth, <b>leaf</b> miners, <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers,</b> aphids and mites: 10 - 12 of them were aimed at control of CM. In spite of that, the fruit damage reached there 2. 3 and 2. 6 % in successive years. Percentage of damage in plots treated with Ecodian was 0. 5 and 0. 7 %, i. e. below the economical threshold; no outbreak of the pest appearance was noted. So, the MD method, with use of the Ecodian CP dispensers, proved to be an effective means of control. The results obtained may open the possibilities of practical use of the method of mating disruption in Bulgaria. This method should favour preservation of the natural environment and enable production of healthy fruits, not polluted by chemicals...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that genetic diversity in tree population may shape associated species assemblages and then drive ecosystem processes. Trees can support large numbers of insect species and some functional traits of trees {{have been shown to}} have major influence on insect communities and resultant damage. Studying the response of insect herbivore populations to the genetic diversity of tree populations is therefore a relevant approach to test community genetics hypotheses. The objective of our study was to evaluate how insect herbivory is affected by genotypes of Populus nigra, a dominant native poplar species in riparian forests of Europe. In a field experiment, we planted eight native P. nigra clones in plots of increasing genetic diversity with combinations of one to six clones. Insect herbivory was measured using visual estimation of leaf damage by six functional guilds of insects: chewers, skeletonisers, leaf miners, gall makers, <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers,</b> sap suckers and sap feeders. Response of insect herbivory to increasing genotypic diversity was analysed by considering the net diversity effect which was further divided in a complementary and a selection effects. Overall we observed slightly higher insect herbivory in poplar clone mixtures than in clone monocultures. This pattern was due to two opposite mechanisms. There was a positive complementary effect, with higher associational susceptibility in more genetically diverse mixtures. On the other hand, the selection effect also increased with the genetic diversity as the more diverse clone mixtures were more likely to comprise insect resistant clones...|$|R
40|$|Cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.) {{is a very}} {{important}} source of income for more than 200, 000 farmer households in Vietnam. The present cashew productivity in Vietnam is low and unstable, and pest damage is partly responsible for this. Cashew farmers rely on pesticides to minimize the damage, resulting in adverse impacts on farm environment and farmers’ health. Weaver ants (Oecophylla spp) are effective biocontrol agents of a range of cashew insect pests in several cashew-growing countries, and these ants are widely distributed in Vietnam. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the potential of weaver ants in cashew orchards in Vietnam. Field surveys and field experiment were conducted in five cashew orchards from July 2006 to January 2008 in Binh Phuoc, Dong Nai, and Ba Ria Vung Tau provinces, Vietnam. Based on the field surveys, the most important pests that damage flushing foliar and floral shoots and young cashew fruits and nuts were mosquito bugs, brown shoot borers, blue shoot borers, and fruit-nut borers. The damage caused by each of these pests was significantly lower on trees with weaver ants compared with trees without the ants, showing that the ants were able to keep these pest damages under the control threshold. Regular monitoring of the field experiment showed that weaver ants were similar to insecticides for controlling mosquito bugs, blue shoot borers, fruit-nut borers, <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers,</b> and <b>leaf</b> miners. Aphids did not become major pests in plot with weaver ants. To manage insect pest assemblage in cashew orchards, an integrated pest management using weaver ants as a major component is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Cashew (Anacardium occidentale L. [Sapindales: Anacardiaceae]) is an {{important}} industrial crop in Vietnam, and it has contributed to more than 200, 000 farmers’ household incomes in rural areas. Pest damage {{is one of the}} constraints on the farmers’ income, and overuse of insecticides has caused environmental and health problems. The integrated cashew improvement (ICI) program using weaver ants (Oecophylla smaragdina (Fabricius) [Hymenoptera: Formicidae]) as a key element developed for Vietnamese cashew farmers has been fully assessed. Weaver ants effectively controlled the main insect pests on cashew, including the tea mosquito bug, the brown shoot borer, <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> and the leafminer. Weaver ants reduced the pest damage to an acceptable level compared to the insecticide treatment, or to levels under the control threshold. Damage caused by sternorrhynchan pests was either negligible or well below the control thresholds. This is because the ICI program enhanced the population of natural enemies, which, in turn, suppressed sternorrhynchan pests. The implementation of the ICI program enhanced arthropod diversity and natural enemy populations in comparison to the farmers’ conventional farming method (FCF), which heavily used insecticides. Compared to the farmers’ conventional farming method, the ICI program generally produced similar nut yield, but with a reduction of expenses by 10. 3 % and an increase of net profits by 13. 3 %. In addition, the ICI program also produced higher quality nuts than the FCF. The competition between weaver ants and other ant species was identified as {{an important}} factor in implementation of the ICI program. To resolve this, orchard understorey and boundary tree management, focussing on improving food sources of other ants, was proposed. Continuation of the ICI program implementation on a large scale is highly recommended for the Vietnam cashew industry...|$|R
