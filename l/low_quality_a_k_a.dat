However, the preprocessing stage doesn’t eliminate all possible defects in the original gray-level image and the orientation estimation in a poor image is extremely unreliable. In order to further eliminate the false minutiae caused by <b>low</b> <b>quality,</b> <b>a</b> minutiae verification mechanism is proposed to improve the identification per- formance. The minutiae verification mechanism uses the concept of eigen-codebook to find the optimal projection bases for true minutiae regions and false minutiae regions.

30|$|Fingermarks often {{suffer from}} <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> (<b>a</b> {{small amount of}} {{relevant}} information present or a low degree of distinctiveness) due to being smudged or partial, overlapped with other marks [6] or distorted by the surface pattern of the object on which they are found [7]. For fingerprints captured under controlled conditions, fingerprint quality metrics abound (for a recent review, see Yao et al. [8]). However, the forensic value of a fingermark is quite different and is difficult to grasp for non-experts. Ulery et al. show that accuracy and repeatability vary even amongst forensic experts and mostly depend on the print quality [9, 10], especially for borderline decisions. Consequently, Kellman et al. use image features to predict “expert performance and subjective assessment of difficulty in fingerprint comparisons” [11].|$|R

We then study the choice of government when government actions are observable with “noise”. Small amounts of noise {{have no effect on}} the choice of government type or on infrastructure provision.

40|$|Abstract Background Annually over 520, 000 newborns {{die from}} {{neonatal}} sepsis, and 60, 000 more from tetanus. Estimates {{of the effect}} of clean birth and postnatal care practices are required for evidence-based program planning. Objective To review the evidence for clean birth and postnatal care practices and estimate the effect on neonatal mortality from sepsis and tetanus for the Lives Saved Tool (LiST). Methods We conducted a systematic review of multiple databases. Data were abstracted into standard tables and assessed by GRADE criteria. Where appropriate, meta-analyses were undertaken. For interventions with <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> evidence but <b>a</b> strong GRADE recommendation, a Delphi process was conducted. Results <b>Low</b> <b>quality</b> evidence supports <b>a</b> reduction in all-cause neonatal mortality (19 % (95 % c. i. 1 – 34 %)), cord infection (30 % (95 % c. i. 20 – 39 %)) and neonatal tetanus (49 % (95 % c. i. 35 – 62 %)) with birth attendant handwashing. Very <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> evidence supports <b>a</b> reduction in neonatal tetanus mortality with a clean birth surface (93 % (95 % c. i. 77 - 100 %)) and no relationship between a clean perineum and tetanus. <b>Low</b> <b>quality</b> evidence supports <b>a</b> reduction of neonatal tetanus with facility birth (68 % (95 % c. i. 47 - 88 %). No relationship was found between birth place and cord infections or sepsis mortality. For postnatal clean practices, all-cause mortality is reduced with chlorhexidine cord applications in the first 24 hours of life (34 % (95 % c. i. 5 – 54 %, moderate quality evidence) and antimicrobial cord applications (63 % (95 % c. i. 41 – 86 %, <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> evidence). One study of postnatal maternal handwashing reported reductions in all-cause mortality (44 % (95 % c. i. 18 – 62 %)) and cord infection ((24 % (95 % c. i. 5 - 40 %)). Given the <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> of evidence, <b>a</b> Delphi expert opinion process was undertaken. Thirty experts reached consensus regarding reduction of neonatal sepsis deaths by clean birth practices at home (15 % (IQR 10 – 20)) or in a facility (27 % IQR 24 – 36)), and by clean postnatal care practices (40 % (IQR 25 – 50)). The panel estimated that neonatal tetanus mortality was reduced by clean birth practices at home (30 % (IQR(20 – 30)), or in a facility (38 % (IQR 34 – 40)), and by clean postnatal care practices (40 % (IQR 30 – 50)). Conclusion According to expert opinion, clean birth and particularly postnatal care practices are effective in reducing neonatal mortality from sepsis and tetanus.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} is to evaluate efficiency based on data on morbidity and mortality, health-related {{quality of life and}} healthcare-related costs after early reversal of temporary ileostomy after rectal resection for cancer compared with the standard procedure (late reversal).

30|$|Overall, we adopt {{a hybrid}} {{approach}} where different query formulation strategies are used {{depending on the}} attributes of blocks.

The reason {{is that it is}} risky to combine <b>a</b> high <b>quality</b> block with <b>a</b> <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> block. <b>A</b> title block usually generates high quality queries, which are usually discriminative enough to identify the article, whereas most “others” blocks generate <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> queries. But we may lose useful queries if ignoring “others” blocks because some of them, such as a body block misclassified as others, are useful.

This paper reviews those findings and provides two models to analyze this data: an equilibrium model and a behavioral cognitive hierarchy model that allows for differing levels of strategic thinking between moviegoers and movie studios. The behavioral model fits the data better, because moviegoer parameters are relatively close to those observed in experimental subjects. These results suggests that limited strategic thinking rather than equilibrium reasoning may be a better explanation for naïve moviegoer behavior...|$|R
