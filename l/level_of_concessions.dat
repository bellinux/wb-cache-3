40|$|To fully {{understand}} the effects of factors that encourage rebellion, we must differentiate between the way such factors influence mass decisions to join an ongoing rebellion {{and the way they}} influence the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> offered by the government. We analyze a three-player bargaining model that allows us to do so. Our results indicate that governments tolerate a greater risk of conflict with their chosen concessions when any conflict that does occur is likely to {{take the form of a}} limited, rather than popular, rebellion. We demonstrate that rebellions are more likely to be popular when the general populace is relatively dissatisfied with the status quo and when the government is relatively incapable of putting down rebellions. Widespread poverty and low state capacity might therefore be associated with a lower likelihood of conflict, but a greater probability that the general populace will participate in any conflict that does occur...|$|E
40|$|We address {{international}} economic sanctions from a bargaining perspective {{and explain the}} variation in states' decisions to employ economic coercion, in the objectives they pursue through it, and {{in the level of}} political concessions they are able to extract. The connection between military and economic coercion is examined first. Using a formalized bargaining model, we show that credible war options are of critical importance in determining whether economic coercion will be used and what distributional impact it might have. Evaluating the model's empirical implications reveals that state choices to initiate economic coercion and what coercion level to set indeed depend on both military and economic factors. We next show that the sanctions literature has not devoted sufficient attention to the strategic considerations behind state decisions to engage in economic coercion. We develop a non-cooperative game-theoretic model that endogenizes decisions to engage in economic coercion and what <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> to demand from the target. The model suggests that economically powerful challengers are {{more likely to engage in}} economic coercion, but, paradoxically, are not more likely to succeed because they also tend to demand greater concessions. Since the occurrence, type, and outcome of economic coercion are all endogenously determined, we estimate them simultaneously when testing the model's empirical implications. The empirical findings confirm that increasing senders' economic advantage indirectly worsens their success prospects. Our central conclusion is that ignoring either the military context of economic coercion or the strategic choices that precede it can result in misleading inferences about its effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|Purpose– The aim of {{this study}} is to define land use policy sources of {{barriers}} to community-based housing options in practice. Design/methodology/approach– The paper accentuated the need to tackle land use sources of barrier to Community Land Trust (CLT) performance, through text analysis of semi-structured interview responses from key stakeholders. Findings– This study found out that there is a need to ameliorate stakeholder approach to community-based housing (CBH), which is hampered by restrictive land use sources of barriers that occur in an urban and rural context. These barriers were found to include both planning inadequacies and a systemic inefficient network of knowledge transfer practices between stakeholders. Recommendations include the need for drastic policy intervention through the political willingness to address Section 106 shortcomings in the choice of affordable housing supply models, and the inaccessibility of land below market rate in an endogenous prescriptive planning system. Practical implications– This paper highlights the subjective limitations of the CLT model in regards to grey areas between setting boundaries to what is an acceptable <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> to CBH and the socio-economic impact or benefits of a completely deregulated social housing system. These boundaries do vary from system to system, hence the need for UK housing institutions to address identified inherent barrier sources and their reconciliation with international best practices. Therefore, greater roles can be accorded to the CLT model in the UK affordable housing dynamics based on its confirmed strengths and merits. Originality/value– This paper adds to literature through the practical identification and interpretation of various key stakeholder perspectives on sources of CLT barriers and an idealised strategy to tackling them accordingly. This contributes to the housing affordability debate on the viability of CBH options, and how it could be invariably hampered by direct and indirect effects of planning and restrictive land use policies in practice.

40|$|The {{juridification}} of {{the dispute}} settlement procedure under the World Trade Organization (WTO) has extended the effective rule of law {{into the realm of}} international trade. Over the years, however, there has been a series of cases in which a losing complained party failed to correct its violation in a timely manner and the complainant had to fall back on the suspension of concessions - countervailing measures whereby certain violation measures were maintained and left uncorrected {{over an extended period of}} time. Such non-implementation or delayed implementation tends to occur in cases of special importance, with a highly complex political background, and has been observed particularly among major WTO Members such as the U. S. and the European Communities. The presence of this implementation issue does not mean that the WTO dispute settlement mechanism is altogether defective. But major Members' repeated disregard of recommendations and rulings of the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) will in the long run threaten the legitimacy of the WTO as a forum for solving trade disputes. Kawase and Araki (2005) examines this problem from various angles to illustrate the diverse factors, both legal and practical, that lie beneath it. Consequently, it has been found that, regarding factors relating to dispute settlement procedures, the adequacy of the interpretation of WTO rules by panel or the Appellate Body, the clarity of panel/Appellate Body recommendations, and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> to be suspended have provoked the implementation issue. To solve this problem, it is necessary to amend the current dispute settlement procedures. Against the backdrop of compliance theory, these findings can be summed up as follows. The problem of non-compliance by WTO members primarily stems from two deficiencies - the lack of enforceability that is based on rational choice theory, and the lack of normative recognition or respect on the part of a losing complained party for the particular WTO judgment. Therefore, procedurally amending these two aspects would improve the implementation of WTO rulings. In negotiations on the amendment of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) under the Doha Round, however, not many proposals made have sufficiently addressed the implementation issue. Moreover, there seems to be no prospect of agreement on the DSU. Under such conditions, the realistic and most desirable choice would be to seek gradual improvements in the implementation by employing a "soft" method with measures that can be taken under the existing DSU, in lieu of trying to amend it. For instance, to strengthen enforceability the DSB could authorize the suspension of concessions in a way more focused on the qualitative aspects of remedies. From the normative point of view, WTO panels and the Appellate Body could exercise judicial economy and discretion over the recommendations of specific way for implementation with a greater recognition of the feasibility of compliance, while the DSB, as a political collegial body, could strengthen the reviewing of panel/Appellate Body reports. ...|$|E

Linz {{prize for}} 2009 - 2010 by the Political and Constitutional Studies Centre in Spain. This thesis seeks {{to explain the}} {{determinants}} of resilient nationalist violence in Western Europe since World War II. Despite {{being one of the}} most affluent regions in the world, several episodes of nationalist violence arose from the late 1960 s all over the continent. Faced with very strong states, these armed movements recurred to terrorist techniques of warfare to mobilize supporters and extract concessions from the goverment. However, some of the nationalist armed organizations succedded in building support and becoming resilient whereas many others failed and disappeared very quickly. In order to explain this variation, I contend that classical 'grievances' arguments must be complemented with 'mobilization' accounts of nationalist violence. Thus, the success of a terrorist nationalist organization in surviving does not only depend on the sources of grievance it can trigger in its fight against the state, but also on its capacity to create a large constituency of support that guarantees the steady flow of recruits, funds and legitimacy. In addition to grievances and 'mobilizational' incentives, this thesis also looks at the specific link between the political elites at the centre of the state and those holding offices at the regional level. If the dominant state-wide political forces also command the largest plurality of votes at the regional level, then state actors will have strong incentives to deal quickly with any nationalist challenge from the region under dispute. Regional politicians whose electoral fortunes depend on state-wide parties prefer reacting with some <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> if they expect the increase of nationalist mobilization {{in the absence of a}} positive state reaction. On the other hand, if regional politicians have autonomous sources of power - i. e., they do not run on state-wide party lists- state political actors will have more trouble in dealing with nationalist violence, since they must rely on the regional actors to assess the real demand for concessions. Whenever regional politicians are averse to change -because they anticipate that potential concessions will be paid by them-, they will advise state makers to repress nationalists. And if armed nationalists have potential to build their own constituency, state repression will contribute to that end. This combination of institutional 'unresponsiveness' and 'mobilizational' incentives can account for the existence of resilient armed nationalist organizations in Western Europe. I test this argument in two steps. First, I analyze a dataset with 30 observations of nationalist-prone European regions. The aim is to check whether the main argument fares empirically well in comparison to more standard explanations of nationalist violence. Second, I run three paired-wise comparisons to track in-depth the process of consolidation of nationalist violence. I compare the Basque Country, Corsica and Northern Ireland with Catalonia, Sardinia and Wales respectively. The main argument of the thesis works reasonably well to account for the observed variation, and it has also some implications for the potential emergence of armed nationalist movements in developing countries...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the suspension <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> or other obligations in the World Trade Organization (WTO), specifically with how the arbitrators have understood this suspension, how they have interpreted the respective legal norms and how they have argued to set the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> suspension. The first chapter contains an introduction. The second chapter discusses the main objectives <b>of</b> suspending WTO <b>concessions</b> or other obligations, especially to induce compliance and to rebalance concessions. The former means creating incentives to bring the complaining party {{to comply with the}} recommendations and rulings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body. The latter means restoring the balance between the parties' concessions that was upset by the complainant. This dissertation offers a three level approach that allows {{a better understanding of how}} these two objectives work. Chapter three {{deals with the}} <b>level</b> <b>of</b> nullification or impairment, and especially with the definition of nullification or impairment, the presumption contained in Art. 3. 8 DSU, the burden of proof and pass through estimations. The fourth chapter addresses the suspension <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> or other obligations, quantitatively as well as qualitatively. The focal point lies on defining the suspension <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> or other obligations, punitive sanctions, carousel sanctions, diachronically variable suspension levels, cross retaliation, standing, the right to suspend concessions or other obligations, and transferring the suspension potential. Chapter five analyses WTO decisions, reports and awards concerning the suspension <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> or other obligations. The results are systematised according to the three yardsticks that define the relation between the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> nullification or impairment and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> suspension <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> or other obligations: equivalence (Art. 22. 4 DSU), appropriateness (Art. 4. 10 and 4. 11 SCM Agreement), and commensurateness (Art. 7. 9 and 7. 10 SCM Agreement).

40|$|WTO dispute {{settlement}} procedures have been praised for their effectiveness, but recently {{there have been}} significant examples of Members failing to observe, or delaying implementation of, rulings and recommendations issued by the Dispute Settlement Bodies to rectify violations of the WTO Agreement. This issue has arisen particularly {{in cases where the}} U. S. has been challenged its "law as such" violations, in other words cases claiming that a country's domestic law or regulation in itself constitutes a violation of the WTO Agreement. These cases include those won by Japan against the U. S., and this implementation problem is becoming a pressing trade policy issue. Given special-interest politics and the "sectionalism" of the compartmentalized committee system in the U. S. Congress, it is desirable that procedures to ensure compliance be structured to encourage the Congress to promptly implement rulings by the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB). However, the current DSU (Dispute Settlement Understanding) and its operation in cases involving "law as such" are not necessarily conducive to this goal. First, when a reasonable period of time (RPT) for compliance is determined, the complained party is allowed a broad degree of discretion in selecting the measure to comply with the recommendation, and there is no guarantee of the shortest possible RPT enabling appropriate implementation. Second, while financial compensation imposes a broad-based fiscal burden on the concerned citizens of the complained party, continuation of the violation benefits special interest groups and circumvents pressure to comply with the DSB ruling. Third, under existing practice, the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> nullification or impairment for determining suspensions <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> (countermeasures) is calculated on the basis of actual trade loss created by the violation in question, excluding the chilling effects on trade. In the few examples where the rules on contravention of the WTO agreement have been applied, the suspension <b>of</b> <b>concessions</b> allowed has not been sufficient to cover this loss. It would be possible to partially resolve some of these issues by making some changes to the interpretation or application of the existing rules, but the agreement needs to be amended, particularly regarding the calculation <b>of</b> the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> suspension <b>of</b> <b>concessions.</b> However, this issue has not been dealt with adequately in the proposals submitted to the DSU negotiations in the Doha Round. ...|$|R
40|$|The thesis empirically investigates how {{revenues}} from hydropower resources affect local governments in Norway, using methods and approaches from recent innovation in applied econometrics. It {{emphasizes the importance}} of using exogenous measures of resource abundance, and investigates how {{revenues from}} natural resources affect the efficiency of public good production, the wages of public sector leaders and public sector energy efficiency. The first article, entitled “Local Natural Resource Curse?” utilizes exogenous variation in natural resource abundance by instrumenting the variation in hydropower revenue by topology, average precipitation and meters of river in steep terrain. This is used to test two hypotheses: The Paradox of Plenty hypothesis and the Rentier State hypothesis. The results support the Paradox of Plenty hypothesis - that higher local government revenue reduces the efficiency in production of public goods. The results does not find support for the Rentier State hypothesis - that revenue derived from natural resources should harm efficiency more than revenue derived from other sources such as taxation. The second article, “Natural Resources and Public Sector Wages”, is an empirical analysis of the effect of natural resource abundance on local public sector leader wages in Norway. The main hypotheses are that a public sector revenue shock from the resource sector: (i) positively affects leader wages; (ii) affects leader wages more than other public sector wages. The results imply that resource abundance does not affect leader wages more positively than for other public sector wages. The third article, “Hydropower Policy and Energy Saving Incentives” examines the implications for energy efficiency of legislation granting local governments that are affected by hydropower production to buy up to 10 percent of the power basis. The actual transferred concession power is restricted to general electricity consumption in the community, resulting in reduced incentives to save electricity for some local governments. The findings in the paper indicates that local governments with a positive gap between the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>concession</b> power and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> general electricity consumption use significantly more energy in their public buildings than other local government...|$|R
