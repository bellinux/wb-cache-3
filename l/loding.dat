50|$|Several {{versions}} of <b>Lode</b> Runner were not {{released in the}} U.S., such as <b>Lode</b> Runner Twin and Power <b>Lode</b> Runner (1999, SFC), which vary gameplay, mostly by adding different characters and scenarios. Another title, Battle <b>Lode</b> Runner, was originally exclusive to Japan, but made available on 23 April 2007 as the first Japan-only game to appear on Nintendo's Virtual Console service. The original <b>Lode</b> Runner followed in June 2007.

40|$|The Mount Wellington mine is {{the most}} recent to recommence {{production}} in the United Kingdom. It lies on the southwestern extension of the Wheal Jane <b>lodes.</b> About half the production conms from the number 1 <b>lode</b> which lies in the footwall of a shallow-dipping elyan sheet. The numbers 2 and 3 <b>lodes</b> have a similar trend but dip more steeply; they join the main <b>lode</b> without intersecting it. These <b>lodes</b> are generally smaller than the number 1 <b>lode</b> but carry higher grades oœ tin. The remaining mine production comes from the number 2 <b>lode,</b> but the number 3 is at present unpayable. All these <b>lodes</b> have a similar mineralogy and paragenesis. The mineralization took place in four stages. In each <b>lode</b> the minerals of the two earlier phases replace brecciated fault zones {{and those of the}} two later phases fill dilatant fractures in the earlier material. These <b>lodes</b> were cut by the mineralized (but uneconomic) Hot <b>lode</b> which may have formed during the later stages of mineralization of the main <b>lodes.</b> All these <b>lodes</b> are cut by two groups of variously mineralized faults called caunterlodes and crosscourses, respectively. Both the main mineralizations and the elvan were controlled by two sets of faults devel-oped around the cooling Carnmenellis granite cupola, probably in response to fluid overpressures...|$|R
5|$|There {{are many}} {{man-made}} waterways, or <b>Lodes</b> nearby, including Wicken <b>Lode</b> and Soham <b>Lode.</b> Researchers suggest the Fenland <b>Lodes</b> are Roman in origin—almost certainly Soham <b>Lode.</b> Other researchers disagree, presenting {{a case for}} such <b>lodes</b> being Anglo-Saxon or later. The Thetford catchwater (drain), constructed in 1838, runs south-west to north-east around {{the eastern edge of}} the built-up part of the village. It drains by gravity, into the River Great Ouse north-east of the village, at the Braham Dock drain.|$|R

There is a right of public {{navigation}} as far as its junction with Monk's <b>Lode,</b> and the stretch beyond that is only navigable by local inhabitants. The <b>lode</b> is not as wide or deep as the adjacent <b>lodes,</b> and can only be navigated by smaller craft. The waterway continues as Monk's <b>Lode</b> and then the New River, although these are not navigable. Peat from Burwell Fen was brought up Wicken <b>lode</b> for much of the 19th century, for distribution to local farms, and the trade only stopped in the 1940s when peat cutting was restricted. Sedge from the fen was transported by boat from the sites where it was cut to a wharf near the head of the <b>lode.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{the southwestern}} {{part of the}} Ashanti Belt, the results of fractal and Fry {{analyses}} of the spatial pattern of 51 known mines/prospects of (mostly <b>lode)</b> gold deposits {{and the results of}} analysis of their spatial associations with faults and fault intersections suggest different predominant structural controls on <b>lode</b> gold mineralisation at local and district scales. Intersections of NNE- and NW-trending faults were likely predominantly involved in local-scale structural controls on <b>lode</b> gold mineralisation, whilst NNE-trending faults were likely predominantly involved in district-scale structural controls on <b>lode</b> gold mineralisation. The results of the spatial analyses facilitate the conceptualisation and selection of spatial evidence layers for <b>lode</b> gold prospectivity mapping in the study area. The applications of the derived map of <b>lode</b> gold prospectivity and a map of radial density of spatially coherent <b>lode</b> gold mines/prospects results in a one-level prediction of 37 undiscovered <b>lode</b> gold prospects. The applications of quantified radial density fractal dimensions of the spatial pattern of spatially coherent <b>lode</b> gold mines/prospects result in an estimate of 40 undiscovered <b>lode</b> gold prospects. The study concludes finally that analysis of the spatial pattern of discovered mineral deposits is the key to a strong link between mineral prospectivity mapping and assessment of undiscovered mineral deposits...|$|R

50|$|Clipmapping is {{a method}} of {{clipping}} a mipmap to a subset of data pertinent to the geometry being displayed. This is useful for loading as little data as possible when memory is limited, such as on a graphics processing unit.

The high-resolution levels of the mipmapped scene representation are clipped to a region near the camera while lower resolution levels are clipped further away.|$|E

50|$|The spatial {{arrangement}} of the <b>lodes</b> points towards local southeasterly extension within the basement rocks. By that time the paragneisses had cooled down to below 300° C. Additionally the <b>lodes</b> experienced shearing motions as shown be the mylonitized edges. This fact combined with the variations in strike possibly hints at a shear zone oriented southeast: the <b>lodes</b> following N 065 can then be interpreted as antithetic surfaces, whereas the <b>lodes</b> following N 045 are probably R'- Riedel shears. Furthermore the fairlysteep northwesterly dip of the <b>lodes</b> hints at a top to the southeast sense of motion (“bookshelfing”).|$|R
