40|$|The {{development}} of decision support systems for equipment diagnosis {{has been found}} to be an iterative process whereby functionality and knowledge are continually added to a prototype until satisfactory performance is achieved. In order to reduce both the dependency on compiled knowledge sources and the number of prototype stages necessary to develop diagnostic decision support systems, this thesis examines, adapts and applies a set theoretical approach to mechanism diagnosis first developed in the field of Artificial Intelligence. The approach does not require the {{development of}} computational models to simulate equipment behaviour. The set theoretical approach was applied to the development of a diagnostic decision support system for a semi-automated Atlas Copco Wagner ST- 8 B <b>Load-Haul-Dump</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Hypothesis sets were generated for the vehicle's hydraulic circuit and Deutz FL- 413 -FW diesel engine. A high level of diagnostic resolution was achieved for the hydraulic circuit, but limited resolution was achieved for the diesel engine. This was postulated to be due to the ratio of observable system outputs to input sub-systems, and the number of least repairable units making up each system. Manual knowledge acquisition was undertaken in an underground mine to refine the diagnostic knowledge developed from the hypothesis sets and to add knowledge to discriminate between competing failure hypotheses. Heuristic failure likelihoods were used to rank hypotheses in order of frequency of occurrence. The knowledge base was implemented as a hypertext decision support system using HyperText Mark-up Language (HTML). The resulting decision support system is platform independent, upgradeable and able to be maintained by site personnel. The system is currently installed at surface level and at 1800 level at INCO Limited's Stobie Mine in Sudbury, Ontario. The thesis makes a number of original contributions, the first two of which are of generic significance. It is the first work to apply set theoretical concepts to structural models of mobile mining equipment in order to diagnose faults. A number of modifications are advanced to the conventional trace-back analysis technique for generating contributor and normality sets, and heuristic guidelines are provided for estimating the costs and benefits of developing, implementing and maintaining diagnostic decision support systems. It is also the first work to formalise a decision support system in HTML and to suggest the application of company-wide internets ("intranets") to disseminate maintenance knowledge within mines...|$|E
40|$|The {{commercial}} industries of agriculture, mining, construction, and material handling employ {{a wide variety}} of mobile machines, including tractors, combines, <b>Load-Haul-Dump</b> <b>vehicles,</b> trucks, paving machines, fork trucks, and many more. Automation of these vehicles promises to improve productivity, reduce operational costs, and increase safety. Since the vehicles typically operate in difficult environments, under all weather conditions, and in the presence of people and other obstacles, reliable automation faces severe technical challenges. Furthermore, the viable technology solutions are constrained by cost considerations. Fortunately, due to the limited application domain, repetitive nature, and the utility of partial automation for most tasks, robotics technologies can have a profound impact on industrial vehicles. In this paper, we describe a technical approach developed at Carnegie Mellon University for automating mobile machines in several applications, including mass excavation, mining, and agriculture. The approach is introduced via case studies, and the results are presented. 1...|$|R

40|$|Energy storage systems (ESS) play an {{important}} role in the performance of mining vehicles. A hybrid ESS combining both batteries (BTs) and supercapacitors (SCs) is one of the most promising solutions. As a case study, this paper discusses the optimal hybrid ESS sizing and energy management strategy (EMS) of 14 -ton underground <b>load-haul-dump</b> <b>vehicles</b> (LHDs). Three novel contributions are added to the relevant literature. First, a multi-objective optimization is formulated regarding energy consumption and the total cost of a hybrid ESS, which are the key factors of LHDs, and a battery capacity degradation model is used. During the process, dynamic programming (DP) -based EMS is employed to obtain the optimal energy consumption and hybrid ESS power profiles. Second, a 10 -year life cycle cost model of a hybrid ESS for LHDs is established to calculate the total cost, including capital cost, operating cost, and replacement cost. According to the optimization results, three solutions chosen from the Pareto front are compared comprehensively, and the optimal one is selected. Finally, the optimal and battery-only options are compared quantitatively using the same objectives, and the hybrid ESS is found to be a more economical and efficient option...|$|R
40|$|Whole-body {{vibration}} describes vibrations {{that are}} transferred from a supporting surface {{to the human}} body. Low back injury is a major health issue amongst heavy machine operators and seat selection is important for reducing vibration exposure. Modeling the vibration attenuation properties of seats is one approach for predicting the performance of seats in different vibration environments. An efficient neural network (NN) algorithm identified the vibration attenuation properties of five suspension seats that are commonly used in the Northern Ontario mining sector. Each of the NN seat models strongly predicted vertical seatpan r. m. s. accelerations from the chassis accelerations and a measure of driver anthropometrics. We implemented the developed NN models to evaluate the performance of industrial seats {{for a variety of}} skidders from the forestry sector and <b>load-haul-dump</b> <b>vehicles</b> from the underground mining environment. Our results demonstrated that seat selection is not universal. The performance and rank orders of industrial seats varied between vibration environments based on the calculated equivalent daily exposure (A(8)) values. We performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the influence of specific vibration frequency components on the predicted daily exposure values. This analysis revealed that each of the industrial seats responded differently to specific vibration frequencies and explained why the seat selection algorithm matched particular seats to specific vibration environments. We also evaluated the performance of the new No-JoltTM air-inflated cushion with multi-axis vibration exposures and vertical jolt exposures. The vibration attenuation properties were assessed for two seat suspensions (with relatively good and poor initial performance) when their foam cushions were replaced with the air-inflated cushion. The air cushion only improved the vibration attenuation properties of the seat that initially had good performance. We also observed that operator’s anthropometrics and sex influenced the performance of the air-inflated cushion in certain cases when vibration environment includes jolt exposures. All of our findings emphasize the importance of matching the specific seat/cushion to the particular vibration environment in order to reduce heavy machine operators’ vibration exposure and minimize their health risks...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{methods of}} {{analysis}} such as the finite element method and finite difference method have seen increasing use {{in recent years as}} tools for geomechanical mine design to predict problems of ground caving and failure. As a result of recent advances in computer technology, it is now possible to handle large-scale problems involving complex material and geometric nonlinearities at an affordable computational cost. The scope of this study is the stability of underground mine haulage drifts associated with sublevel stoping method with delayed backfill. This {{is one of the most}} popular mining methods today in Canadian underground metal mines. In this method, blasted ore is mucked with <b>load-haul-dump</b> <b>vehicles</b> and transported to the nearest dump through a nearby haulage drift. Therefore, it is crucial in a mining operation that a haulage drift remains functional during the life of the stope. This study is focused on studying the interaction between the haulage drift and nearby mining activity. The stability of the haulage drift is examined through a detailed parametric study of a finite element model representing typical mining layout most commonly adopted in Canadian underground metal mines. The model parametric study examines the influence of critical factors such as the stope mining sequences, mining depth and the distance between the stope and the haulage drift. The model is set up for nonlinear behaviour of the rock mass taking into account elastoplasticity of the rock mass and non-associated plasticity using Mohr Coulomb and Drucker Prager yield functions. Stability indicators are defined in terms of displacement, stress and the extent of yield zones. These indicators serve as a basis for assessing the effect of different parameters on the stability of the haulage drift. From the model parametric study, it is found that stope mining causes a lateral movement of the entire drift. The severity of such movement is increased with shorter distance between the stope and haulage drift. Of all mining sequences examined, same-level mining is the most critical step. It is also found that more yield zones develop around the haulage drift as the mining depth increases and as distance between haulage drift and the stope decreases. A 3 -centre arc drift is compared with a rectangular one of the same cross sectional area. It is found that the 3 -centre arc drift shape is more stable. This study also demonstrates that the nonlinear elastoplastic analysis gives more realistic results than traditional linear elastic analysis in terms of stress and displacement behaviour of the haulage drift...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} health risks to operators of large and small <b>load-haul-dump</b> (LHD) <b>vehicles</b> exposed to whole-body vibration (WBV), based on criteria established in ISO 2631 - 1, ISO 2631 - 5, and EU Directive 2002 / 44 EC. Studies simultaneously evaluating health risks based on all three standards are limited. Operator WBV exposure was measured in accordance with ISO 2631 - 1 using a tri-axial seat pad accelerometer. According to ISO 2631 - 1, four of the seven large LHD vehicle operators and three of six small LHD vehicle operators were exposed to WBV above the 8 -hour vibration dose value (VDV) health guidance caution zone (HGCZ). According to the EU Directive 2002 / 44 /EC criteria one of the seven large LHD vehicle operators and one of the six small LHD vehicle operators were exposed to WBV above the VDV daily exposure limit. However, health risks predicted by ISO 2631 - 5 criteria only placed one of seven large LHD vehicle operators and one of the six small LHD vehicle operators in the high probability of an adverse health effect category. Thus, the probability of adverse health effects, associated with WBV exposure during LHD vehicle operation, is suggested to be greatest based on the ISO 2631 - 1 8 -hour VDV HGCZ and lowest based on ISO 2631 - 5 Sed criterion values...|$|R
40|$|The mining {{industry}} is constantly {{under pressure to}} improve productivity, effciency and safety. Although an increased use of automation technology {{has the potential of}} con- tributing to improvements in all three factors mines have been relatively slow to make use of automation technology. Automation in the underground mining environment is a challenging prospect {{for a number of reasons}} not least of which being the diffculties and associated costs of installing infrastructure in this hazardous environment. The work described in this dissertation focuses on the modelling of a <b>Load-Haul-Dump</b> or LHD <b>vehicle</b> for the purpose of autonomous navigation and control. Considerable progress has been made in automating underground mining vehicles in recent years, and successful test installations have been made. There are still however a number of shortcomings in the existing autonomous underground mine vehicle navigation systems. This dissertation attempts to address some of these problems through the development of a more accurate vehicle model for an LHD vehicle incorporating some vehicle and tyre dynamics thereby potentially reducing the number of sensors and the amount of installed infrastructure necessary to implement the vehicle navigation system. Simulation results are provided for different vehicle modelling techniques and the results are compared and discussed in terms of their suitability for physical implementation in an underground mine.

40|$|Underground mines {{typically}} {{do not represent}} the best working conditions for humans, and many mining companies have the intent to remove all humans from the ore extraction areas. To achieve this goal automation of the mining machinery is required. One of the riskier jobs in a mine is to operate the <b>Load-Haul-Dump</b> (LHD) <b>vehicles</b> {{that are used to}} transport the ore from the blast site to a truck, lorry or directly to a crusher. Today these vehicles are typically controlled by an on-board manual operator. The purpose of the work presented in this thesis is to develop and evaluate algorithms and methods to enable high productivity unmanned operation of LHDs, including two different operating modes. The first mode is fully autonomous navigation, applicable to static environments, where the LHDs are repeatedly driven along the same paths for extended periods. Here, an existing framework for reactive navigation based on fuzzy logic has been extended with novel feature detection algorithms for tunnel following and topological localisation based on 2 D laser range scanner data. These algorithms have been verified in quantitative tests to be fast, reliable and tolerant to noise in the sensor data. Moreover, the whole navigation system has been evaluated in qualitative tests in indoor environments using an ordinary research robot. The autonomous navigation system for LHDs currently commercialized by Atlas Copco is partly based on the experiences gained from the work presented here. The second mode explored is semi-autonomous operation, where local-autonomy functionality on-board the machine assists a tele-remote operator in driving the vehicle along a collision-free path. This mode is intended for mines where the driving path of the machine changes frequently, so the setup needed for a fully autonomous system becomes impractical. In this part of the work a user study in a real mine has been performed, showing that local autonomy has the potential to significantly improve the productivity of a tele-remote operated LHD. Based on these results, a commercial tele-operating system for underground mines has been extended with a novel local autonomy functionality, inspired by existing autonomous navigation systems. The performance of this system has been verified in experiments performed on a real 38 tonnes LHD in a test mine, and in simulations aimed to show that the system works in arbitrary underground mine environments.
