500|$|In September 1993, Jackson {{appeared}} topless on {{the cover}} of Rolling Stone magazine with the hands of her then-husband René Elizondo, Jr. covering her breasts. The photograph is the original full-length version of the cropped image used {{on the cover}} of the Janet album, shot by Patrick Demarchelier. In the cover story, [...] "Sexual Healing" [...] by David Ritz, Jackson explained, [...] "sex has been an important part of me for several years. But it just hasn't blossomed publicly until now. I've had to go through some changes and shed some old attitudes before feeling completely comfortable with my body. <b>Listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> new record, people intuitively understand the change in me". Ritz likened Jackson's transformation to Marvin Gaye as he stated, [...] " [...] just as Gaye moved from What's Going On to Let's Get It On, from the austere to the ecstatic, Janet, every bit as serious-minded as Marvin, moved from Rhythm Nation to Janet, her statement of sexual liberation".|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{about the}} album's title, Mars explained: [...] "I have records {{that women are}} going to relate to and men are going to relate to. So doo-wops are for the girls, and hooligans are for the guys." [...] In several {{interviews}} Mars furthered the concept: [...] "I grew up <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> dad who loved doo-wop music", those sounds are [...] "straight to the point" [...] and simple, they rely on a [...] "beautiful melody and voice" [...] with a connection, that represents his romantic side. However, due to his young age, at that time, he liked to party which shows his Hooligans side!" [...] Mars stated in an interview with MTV News that he had been working on his debut album and it was completed by the date of the interview. His debut EP, It's Better If You Don't Understand, released earlier in the year, gave [...] "a little taste of what's in store".|$|E
2500|$|... 1: The Sumo Association [...] "advises" [...] {{nineteen}} wrestlers {{to retire}} because of match-fixing: makuuchi-ranked Tokusegawa, Kasugao, Koryu, Hakuba, Shimotori, Kotokasuga and Mokonami, jūryō Masatsukasa, Asofuji, Sakaizawa, Wakatenro, Kiyoseumi, Toyozakura and Kyokunankai, former makuuchi Yamamotoyama and Jumonji, and former jūryō [...] Hoshihikari, Kirinowaka and Shirononami. Tanigawa Oyakata, (the former Kaiho), is {{also asked to}} resign but is quoted as saying, [...] "This is absolutely ridiculous. I told the Japan Sumo Association board that the panel’s investigation was full of holes. I will take legal action." [...] Many of the other wrestlers also declare their anger at being forced to retire, with Yamamotoyama saying,"They decided without <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> excuse," [...] and Wakatenro protesting, [...] "There's no way I can accept this because I'm being forced out simply because my name came up in some testimonies and text messages." [...] They had until April 5 of that year to hand in their retirement papers, or face the even more harsh punishment of outright dismissal. Two year bans are given to those who admitted wrongdoing: Chiyohakuho, Takenawa Oyakata (ex Kasuganishiki) and sandanme ranked Enatsukasa (who acted as the go-between). However, all three have indicated they are leaving sumo completely. [...] Enatsukasa issued an apology to sumo fans, saying [...] "I've {{caused a lot of}} problems for the wrestlers who genuinely put in the work, and it hurts." [...] Seventeen sumo elders are demoted, with executive members Kitanoumi, Kokonoe and Michinoku resigning from their posts and chairman Hanaregoma taking a 30 per cent pay cut for two months. Hanaregoma told a press conference, [...] "We had to punish many people, all of whom are our colleagues. It was a very tough decision to make." [...] About ten other wrestlers are still under investigation, meaning {{it is unlikely that the}} Natsu tournament in May will go ahead.|$|E
