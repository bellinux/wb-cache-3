5|$|GM {{assembly}} plants were operated in New Zealand from 1926 until 1990 by General Motors New Zealand Limited {{in an earlier}} and quite separate operation from Holden's in Australia. Although Holden's involvement in exports has fluctuated since the 1950s, the declining sales of <b>large</b> <b>cars</b> in Australia led the company to look to international markets to increase profitability. Since 2010 Holden has incurred losses due to the strong Australian dollar, and government grants have been reduced. This led to the announcement on 11 December 2013 that Holden will cease vehicle and engine production {{by the end of}} 2017, however, the company will continue to have a large and ongoing presence in Australia importing and selling cars as national sales company. Holden will retain their design centre, but with reduced staffing.|$|E
25|$|The earlier {{agreement}} between Chrysler and AMC in 1985, under which AMC would produce M-body chassis rear-drive <b>large</b> <b>cars</b> {{for two years}} from 1986–88, fed the rumor that Chrysler was about to buy AMC. According {{to the head of}} manufacturing for Chrysler at the time, Stephan Sharf, the existing relationship with AMC producing a car for a competitor facilitated the negotiations.|$|E

25|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{vehicles}} are manufactured in the United States, from compact cars to full-size luxury vehicles. The American automobile industry itself is probably {{best known for the}} manufacture of <b>large</b> <b>cars,</b> leading to the common public perception of American cars being larger than those from other countries and making the US well known for the production of so-called land yachts.|$|E
25|$|The 1979 Mustang moved {{again to}} a larger {{platform}} the other first generation subcompacts were replaced by similarly sized, but now compact (and not anymore subcompact) called vehicles - in fact a reclassification that happened {{at the same time}} as former compact cars were now called mid-sized cars and former intermediate cars were now called <b>large</b> <b>cars.</b> At this time another segment started opening up below Gremlin, Pinto and Vega that became the new subcompact segment.|$|E
25|$|The crisis {{reduced the}} demand for <b>large</b> <b>cars.</b> Japanese imports, {{primarily}} the Toyota Corona, the Toyota Corolla, the Datsun B210, the Datsun510, the Honda Civic, the Mitsubishi Galant (a captive import from Chrysler sold as the Dodge Colt), the Subaru DL, and later the Honda Accord all had four cylinder engines that were more fuel efficient than the typical American V8 and six cylinder engines. Japanese imports became mass-market leaders with unibody construction and front-wheel drive, which became de facto standards.|$|E

25|$|Starting in 1982, Teague {{worked on}} the first <b>large</b> <b>cars</b> sold by AMC since 1978, the front-drive sedan code named X-58, for {{introduction}} in late-1986. and a companion code named X-59, that was to debut for the 1988 model year. He achieved a roomy interior in an aerodynamic design, and the two-door model was to have featured hidden headlamps, but the coupe was never produced. Giorgetto Giugiaro penned the sharper-edged exterior design for the four-door sedan that went into production as the Eagle Premier.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, Volvo {{opened the}} Volvo Halifax Assembly plant, the first {{assembly}} {{plant in the}} company's history outside of Sweden, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. In 1964, Volvo opened its Torslanda plant in Sweden, which currently {{is one of its}} largest production sites (chiefly <b>large</b> <b>cars</b> and SUVs). Then in 1965, the Ghent, Belgium plant was opened, which is the company's second largest production site. This was also Volvo's first location producing cars within the European Economic Community. In 1989, the Uddevalla plant in Sweden was opened, which was jointly operated by Volvo Car Corporation and Pininfarina Sverige AB from 2005 to 2013.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, {{the company}} became a holding company when it spun off its various {{businesses}} into autonomous companies, {{one of them}} being Fiat Auto. That same year, sales reached an all-time high in the US, corresponding to the Iranian Oil Crisis. However, when gas prices fell again after 1981, Americans began purchasing sport utility vehicles, minivans, and pickup trucks in larger numbers (marking a departure from their past preference for <b>large</b> <b>cars).</b> Also, Japanese automakers had been taking an ever-larger share of the car market, increasing at {{more than half a}} percent a year. Consequently, in 1984, Fiat and Lancia withdrew from the United States market. In 1989, it did the same in the Australian market, although it remained in New Zealand.|$|E

25|$|Rapid transit is an {{intracity}} system {{built in}} large cities and has the highest capacity of any passenger transport system. It is usually grade-separated and commonly built underground or elevated. At street level, smaller trams can be used. Light rails are upgraded trams that have step-free access, their own right-of-way and sometimes sections underground. Monorail systems are elevated, medium-capacity systems. A people mover is a driverless, grade-separated train that serves only a few stations, as a shuttle. Due {{to the lack of}} uniformity of rapid transit systems, route alignment varies, with diverse rights-of-way (private land, side of road, street median) and geometric characteristics (sharp or broad curves, steep or gentle grades). For instance, the Chicago 'L' trains are designed with extremely short cars to negotiate the sharp curves in the Loop. New Jersey's PATH has similar-sized cars to accommodate curves in the trans-Hudson tunnels. San Francisco's BART operates <b>large</b> <b>cars</b> on its well-engineered routes.|$|E
2500|$|The 1976 {{models were}} {{the last of the}} {{traditional}} American <b>large</b> <b>cars</b> powered by mostly big block V8 engines. After this year, all GM models would go through [...] "downsizing" [...] and shrink in length, width, weight and available engine size.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{known as}} {{full-size}} luxury cars, grand saloons, or premium <b>large</b> <b>cars,</b> while [...] "Oberklasse" [...] {{is used in}} Germany. Typically a four-door saloon (sedan). These are the most powerful saloons, with six, eight and twelve-cylinder engines and have more equipment than smaller models. Vehicles in this category include some of the models from the flagship lines of luxury car brands, such as Cadillac CT6, Lincoln Town Car and Maserati Quattroporte.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{aircraft}} engine manufactured by Daimler was the 80hp Gnome Monosoupape rotary. With no drawings available to them, Daimler's Gnome engines were reverse-engineered from an engine delivered {{to them on}} 7 August 1914. Daimler later built the RAF 1 and 1a air-cooled V8s, the RAF 4 and 4a V12s, the Le Rhone rotary, and the Bentley BR2 rotary alongside other manufacturers. Production of RAF 4 engines gave Daimler experience in building V12 engines which would be appreciated when they later designed and built [...] "Double-Six" [...] V12 engines for their <b>large</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Generally, {{drivers of}} SUVs are safer {{than those in}} small and {{mid-size}} cars. In an IIHS survey of death rates by vehicle style, smaller cars fare worse than bigger ones. 4-door minicars have a death rate of 82, compared with 46 for very large 4-doors." [...] This survey reflects the effect of both vehicle design and driving behaviour. Drivers of SUVs, minivans, and <b>large</b> <b>cars</b> may drive differently than the drivers of small or mid-size cars, therefore the effect of drivers in the survey may affect the result.|$|E
2500|$|Ambulances may be {{supplemented}} or {{supported by}} vehicles that lack {{the capacity to}} transport a patient. [...] The most common of these vehicles is known by several names, including 'Response Car'. Response cars are often equipped {{with much of the}} same equipment carried by an ambulance, but, since they are SUVs or <b>large</b> <b>cars,</b> they are often faster and nimbler. Response cars are staffed by one or more medical providers, and are used variously as a source of additional (or more skilled) manpower, as a supervisor's vehicle, or as a first response vehicle, enabling medical treatment to begin before the arrival of the ambulance.|$|E

50|$|After World War II, <b>larger</b> <b>cars</b> {{required}} <b>larger</b> engines, {{and buyers}} of <b>larger</b> <b>cars</b> tended to prefer V8s; performance sixes {{such as the}} Hudson Hornet 308 CID L engine were exceptions to the rule, and were not often top sellers although it {{became one of the}} hottest cars on the road and dominated stock car racing (NASCAR) in the early 1950s.|$|R
2500|$|The Ambassador was {{redesigned}} {{and stretched}} [...] {{to become the}} biggest ever, just as the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo sparked gasoline rationing across the nation. The additional length was due to a new front end design and stronger energy absorbing bumpers required of all automobiles sold in the U.S. Sales of all <b>large</b> <b>cars</b> fell due to economic problems and rising gasoline prices. The full-sized Ambassador was discontinued as AMC's flagship line after the 1974 model year. Nash and AMC made Ambassadors from 1927 to 1974, the longest use of the same model name for any AMC product and, at the time, the longest continuously used nameplate in the industry.|$|E
2500|$|Abernethy {{believed}} that AMC's reputation of building reliable economical cars could {{be translated into}} a new strategy that could follow AMC buyers as they traded up into larger, more expensive vehicles. AMC in reality had produced <b>large</b> <b>cars</b> throughout most of its history, The Rambler Ambassadors were every bit {{as large as a}} full-sized Ford or Chevy. There was only an absence of largest sized cars from the AMC lineup in 1963 and 1964 The first cars bearing his signature were the 1965 models. These were a longer Ambassador series and new convertibles for the larger models. During mid-year a fastback, called the Marlin, was added. It competed directly with cars like the Dodge Charger, AMC's [...] "family-sized" [...] car emphasized personal-luxury. Abernethy also called for the de-emphasis of the Rambler brand. The 1966 Marlin and Ambassador lost their Rambler nameplates, and were badged as [...] "American Motors" [...] products. The new models shared fewer parts among each other and were more expensive to build.|$|E
2500|$|Lacking the {{financial}} resources for a full redesign, AMC dropped the large Ambassador after 1974, while the Matador was discontinued after 1978, {{around the same time}} as Ford moved their full-size nameplates to a smaller platform. The downsized 1977 Chevrolet Impala also spelled doom for large intermediates from AMC and Chrysler. American Motors responded to the declining demand for <b>large</b> <b>cars</b> by introducing a new nameplate in 1978, the AMC Concord. The Concord was an upmarket restyling and positioning of the compact AMC Hornet which had the same [...] wheelbase as the redesigned intermediate 1978 Chevrolet Malibu. It was presented as combining an [...] "easy-to-handle size with a roomy sumptuous interior" [...] and in contrast to the Matador coupe, the [...] "overall styling was pleasant... would not offend anyone" [...] This was the first full-line of economical, compact-sized cars with luxurious trim, features, and comfort levels previously available only in larger automobiles.|$|E
50|$|With Japanese {{manufacturers}} producing very affordable, reliable, {{and popular}} cars throughout the 1990s, Japan became the <b>largest</b> <b>car</b> producing {{nation in the}} world in 2000. However, its market share has decreased slightly in recent years, particularly due to old and new competition from South Korea, China and India. Nevertheless, Japan's car industry continues to flourish, its market share has risen again, and {{in the first quarter of}} 2008 Toyota surpassed American General Motors to become the world's <b>largest</b> <b>car</b> manufacturer. Today, Japan is the third largest automobile market and, until China recently overtook them, was the <b>largest</b> <b>car</b> producer in the world. Still, automobile export remains one of the country's most profitable exports and is a cornerstone of recovery plan for the latest economic crisis. Even though Japan has been taken over by Mainland China as the world's <b>largest</b> <b>car</b> producer, Japanese imports continue to be widely used on streets and highways in the Chinese special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau.|$|R
