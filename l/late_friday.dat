Early the next morning, they took {{a position on the}} lower slopes of the hill of Uhud. Shortly before the battle commenced, 'Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy (the chief of the Khazraj tribe) and his followers withdrew their support for Muhammad and returned to Medina, with reports suggesting Ibn Ubayy's discontent with the plan to march out from Medina to meet the Meccans. Ibn Ubayy and his followers would later receive censure in the Qur'an for this act.|$|E

5|$|By <b>late</b> <b>Friday</b> night, {{they had}} laid {{out what was}} {{essentially}} a new airplane. The new design (464-49) built upon the basic layout of the B-47 Stratojet with 35 degree swept wings, eight engines paired in four underwing pods, and bicycle landing gear with wingtip outrigger wheels. A notable feature of the landing gear was the ability to pivot the main landing gear up to 20° from the aircraft centerline to increase safety during crosswind landings. After {{a trip to a}} hobby shop for supplies, Schairer set to work building a model. The rest of the team focused on weight and performance data. Wells, who was also a skilled artist, completed the aircraft drawings. On Sunday, a stenographer was hired to type a clean copy of the proposal. On Monday, Schairer presented Colonel Warden with a neatly bound 33-page proposal and a 14-inch scale model. The aircraft was projected to exceed all design specifications.|$|E

Kinne allowed that she had, indeed, seen Patricia that day; she had met her to tell her about Walter's affair. According to Kinne, she last saw Patricia where she dropped her off near the Jones house, speaking to an unknown man in a green 1957 Ford. [...] Based on Kinne's admission over the phone, Walter Jones met with her <b>late</b> <b>Friday</b> evening and insisted she give him more details about where his wife was; he later admitted to {{going so far as to}} hold a key to her throat threateningly. Kinne's response was, after leaving Jones, to call John Boldizs and ask him to help her search for Patricia Jones. Shortly before midnight, and within hours of Kinne's conversation with Walter Jones, she and Boldizs had found the body of a woman in a secluded area approximately one mile outside of Independence.

50|$|In fall 1973 NBC's {{decision}} {{to launch a}} nightly program after the Tonight Show was prompted by the 1971 Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act which banned tobacco advertising on television, resulting {{in a loss of}} revenue for the network. The thinking was that extending the broadcast day by one hour could help recover some of that income. NBC had begun programming the 1:00 a.m. time slot on early Saturdays (<b>late</b> <b>Fridays)</b> with The Midnight Special, which began regular airings (initially brokered) eight months before Tomorrow launched; the success of The Midnight Special was a likely factor in expanding programming in the time slot to five days a week.|$|R

Di Grassi was fourth-fastest, ahead of Rosenqvist in fifth and Bird sixth. Conway, Nelson Piquet Jr., Heidfeld and Prost rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Bird's car shut down because of a power failure at the exit of the first turn. He abandoned his vehicle {{at the side of}} the track, and the session was stopped after three minutes. Bird's teammate López caused a brief full course yellow flag period when he gently collided with the turn one barrier. He was able to reverse out the corner and drove to the pit lane. Esteban Gutiérrez went off into one of the track's run-off areas, and both Audi Sport ABT drivers locked their tyres, reversing out of the turn one escape road. Di Grassi recorded the fastest time in second session on a qualifying simulation with a late lap of one minute and 1.359 seconds; he was two-tenths of a second faster than López in second and Buemi was third. Daniel Abt was fourth-fastest; Bird was fifth and Rosenqvist placed sixth. Prost was seventh-quickest, Oliver Turvey eighth, Vergne ninth and Robin Frijns completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.
