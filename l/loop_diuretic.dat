5|$|While {{many sources}} {{recommend}} additional intravenous agents to reduce {{damage to the}} kidney, most of the evidence supporting this practice comes from animal studies, and is inconsistent and conflicting. Mannitol acts by osmosis to enhance urine production and is thought to prevent myoglobin deposition in the kidney, but its efficacy has not been shown in studies {{and there is a}} risk of worsening kidney function. The addition of bicarbonate to the intravenous fluids may alleviate acidosis (high acid level of the blood) and make the urine more alkaline to prevent cast formation in the kidneys; evidence suggesting that bicarbonate has benefits above saline alone is limited, and it can worsen hypocalcemia by enhancing calcium and phosphate deposition in the tissues. If urine alkalinization is used, the pH of the urine is kept at 6.5 or above. Furosemide, a <b>loop</b> <b>diuretic,</b> is often used to ensure sufficient urine production, but evidence that this prevents kidney failure is lacking.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Loop</b> <b>diuretics</b> are an {{integral}} part of heart failure management. It has been shown that <b>loop</b> <b>diuretics</b> cause thiamine deficiency (TD) by increasing its urinary loss. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of TD in heart failure patients on long-term oral <b>loop</b> <b>diuretics.</b> Methods: Heart failure patients (cases) on oral <b>loop</b> <b>diuretics</b> (furosemide ≥ 40 mg/day or torsemide ≥ 20 mg/day), irrespective of the cause of heart failure, were compared to non-heart failure patients (controls) not on <b>loop</b> <b>diuretics</b> in a 1 : 1 ratio. Whole blood free thiamine level was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Results: A total of 100 subjects were enrolled in a 1 : 1 ratio (50 cases and 50 controls). 67 % of the total study population had TD, (defined as whole blood free thiamine level < 0. 7 ng/ml). There was no difference in mean thiamine level between cases and controls. On comparing patients with TD in both groups, patients on diuretics had significantly lower thiamine level compared to the patients, not on diuretics (P < 0. 0001). Conclusions: There was no difference in the thiamine level when patients on <b>loop</b> <b>diuretics</b> were compared to controls. However, very low thiamine levels (< 0. 1 ng/ml) was significantly more common in patients on <b>loop</b> <b>diuretics...</b>|$|R

25|$|Metolazone {{may also}} be used in renal (kidney) disease, such as chronic renal failure or the {{nephrotic}} syndrome. Chronic renal failure causes excess fluid retention that is often treated with diet adjustments and diuretics. Metolazone may be combined with other diuretics (typically loop diuretics) to treat diuretic resistance in CHF, chronic renal failure, and nephrotic syndrome. Metolazone and a <b>loop</b> <b>diuretic</b> will synergistically enhance diuresis {{over the use of}} either agent alone. Using this combination, diuretic effects will occur at two different segments of the nephron; namely, the <b>loop</b> <b>diuretic</b> will act at the loop of Henle, and metolazone will act at the distal convoluted tubule.

40|$|Background and Purpose <b>Loop</b> <b>diuretics</b> {{are widely}} used to inhibit the Na+, K+, 2 Cl- co-transporter, but they also inhibit the cystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl - channel. Here, we investigated the mechanism of CFTR inhibition by <b>loop</b> <b>diuretics</b> and explored the effects of chemical structure on channel blockade. Experimental Approach Using the patch-clamp technique, we tested the effects of bumetanide, furosemide, piretanide and xipamide on recombinant wild-type human CFTR. Key Results When added to the intracellular solution, <b>loop</b> <b>diuretics</b> inhibited CFTR Cl- currents with potency approaching that of glibenclamide, a widely used CFTR blocker with some structural similarity to <b>loop</b> <b>diuretics.</b> To begin to study the kinetics of channel blockade, we examined the time dependence of macroscopic current inhibition following a hyperpolarizing voltage step. Like glibenclamide, piretanide blockade of CFTR was time and voltage dependent. By contrast, furosemide blockade was voltage dependent, but time independent. Consistent with these data, furosemide blocked individual CFTR Cl- channels with 'very fast' speed and drug-induced blocking events overlapped brief channel closures, whereas piretanide inhibited individual channels with 'intermediate' speed and drug-induced blocking events were distinct from channel closures. Conclusions and Implications Structure-activity analysis of the <b>loop</b> <b>diuretics</b> suggests that the phenoxy group present in bumetanide and piretanide, but absent in furosemide and xipamide, might account for the different kinetics of channel block by locking <b>loop</b> <b>diuretics</b> within the intracellular vestibule of the CFTR pore. We conclude that <b>loop</b> <b>diuretics</b> are open-channel blockers of CFTR with distinct kinetics, affected by molecular dimensions and lipophilicity...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Loop</b> <b>diuretics</b> {{act on the}} Na+-K+-2Cl− symporter (cotransporter) in {{the thick}} {{ascending}} limb of the loop of Henle to inhibit sodium, chloride and potassium reabsorption. This is achieved by competing for the Cl− binding site. Because magnesium and calcium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb {{is dependent on the}} positive lumen voltage gradient set up by potassium recycling through renal outer medullary potassium channel, <b>loop</b> <b>diuretics</b> also inhibit their reabsorption. By disrupting the reabsorption of these ions, <b>loop</b> <b>diuretics</b> prevent the generation of a hypertonic renal medulla. [...] Without such a concentrated medulla, water has less of an osmotic driving force to leave the collecting duct system, ultimately resulting in increased urine production. <b>Loop</b> <b>diuretics</b> cause a decrease in the renal blood flow by this mechanism.
