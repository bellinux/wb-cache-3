25|$|The {{basic model}} assumes the {{observed}} HDR is the predicted HDR scaled by the weights for each event and then added, with noise mixed in.

Hence one could choose any subset of the equations, with the number equal {{to the number of}} variables, and solve them.

The GLM model attempts to find the scaling weights that minimize the sum of the squares of the error. This method is provably optimal if the error were distributed as a bell curve, and if the scaling-and-summing model were accurate.

40|$|Abstract. A {{system of}} <b>linear</b> <b>equations</b> over a skew-field has {{properties}} similar to properties {{of a system}} of <b>linear</b> <b>equations</b> over a field. However, noncommutativity of a product creates a new picture. Instead of one type {{of a system of}} <b>linear</b> <b>equations,</b> we have four different types. To find a solution of different types of systems of <b>linear</b> <b>equations</b> we need to extend the definition of a quasideterminant given in [1, 2] and introduce two different types of a quasideterminant. As in the commutative case, solutions of a system of <b>linear</b> <b>equations</b> build up right or left module depending on type of system. We study modules together with the system of <b>linear</b> <b>equations</b> because their properties have a close relationship. As in a commutative case, the group of automorphisms of a module has a single transitive representation on a frame manifold. This gives us an opportunity to introduce passive and active representations. Studying a module over a skew-field uncovers new details in the relationship between passive and active transformations, makes this picture more clear. 1...|$|R
