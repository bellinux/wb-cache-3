50|$|On {{manually}} controlled lathes, {{the thread}} pitches {{that can be}} cut are, in some ways, determined by the pitch of the lead-screw: A lathe with a metric <b>lead-screw</b> will readily cut metric threads (including BA), while one with an imperial <b>lead-screw</b> will readily cut imperial-unit-based threads such as BSW or UTS (UNF, UNC). This limitation is not insurmountable, because a 127-tooth gear, called a transposing gear, is used to translate between metric and inch thread pitches. However, this is optional equipment that many lathe owners do not own. It is also a larger change-wheel than the others, and on some lathes may be larger than the change-wheel mounting banjo is capable of mounting.|$|E

As the screw (or bolt) is rotated, the screw moves along its axis through the fixed nut, or the non-rotating nut moves along the <b>lead-screw.</b>|$|E
50|$|Manually {{controlled}} metalworking lathes {{are commonly}} {{provided with a}} variable-ratio gear-train to drive the main <b>lead-screw.</b> This enables different thread pitches to be cut. On some older lathes or more affordable new lathes, the gear trains are changed by swapping gears with various numbers of teeth onto or off of the shafts, while more modern or expensive manually controlled lathes have a quick-change box to provide commonly used ratios by the operation of a lever. CNC lathes use computers and servomechanisms to regulate the rates of movement.|$|E

The tool-post may be driven manually or automatically to produce the roughing and finishing cuts required to turn the workpiece to the desired shape and dimensions, or for cutting threads, worm gears, etc. Cutting fluid may also be pumped to the cutting site to provide cooling, lubrication and clearing of swarf from the workpiece. Some lathes may be operated under control of a computer for mass production of parts (see [...] "Computer numerical control").|$|R

50|$|The IAC {{actuator}} is an electrically controlled device, {{which gets}} its {{input from the}} vehicle's ECU. The actuator is fitted such that it either bypasses the throttle or operates the throttle butterfly valve directly. The actuator consists of a linear servo actuator servomotor that controls a plunger which varies air flow through the throttle body. The position of the servomotor and hence the amount of air bypass is controlled digitally by the engine ECU. This allows the engine's idle speed to be maintained constant. The linear servo is most commonly {{a combination of a}} DC motor, <b>lead-screw</b> and a digital optical encoder.|$|E

40|$|Three {{designs of}} a {{floating}} spar platform for a vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT) are considered, including two novel de-signs. The novel designs convert the rotary {{motion of the}} plat-form to a translational motion (namely, heave), to reduce the maximum yaw stiffness requirements of the mooring system. In typical operational conditions of a VAWT, the mooring system needs to be stiff to prevent the yaw rotation of the platform, al-lowing power to be taken off from the rotary electromagnetic gen-erator. The first design considered is a simple spar platform with mooring lines in a spread-mooring configuration. The second design, a novel design, incorporates a <b>lead-screw</b> to couple the rotational motion to a translational motion. This design {{can take advantage of}} the hydrostatic restoring force present in heave to reduce the mooring stiffness. The third design, also a novel de-sign, uses a spar-torus combination platform and a <b>lead-screw</b> to counteract the torque on the stator of the generator. Numerical models in the time domain are developed to simulate the dynam-ics of these three platforms in regular waves and constant-wind conditions and the results are reported. It was found that the stiffness requirements of the second design can be reduced by 25 % without changing the transient dynamics. If the wave cli-mate is energetic enough, the third design can not only reduce the yaw stiffness requirements but also increase the mean powe...|$|E

40|$|The {{wear and}} fatigue life of <b>lead-screw</b> {{actuators}} {{is a topic}} of great interest {{in the field of}} Industrial Automation. The friction, wear and resulting fatigue life behaviors in this type of actuators closely relates to many factors such as load, velocity, lubrication, material properties, surface properties, pressure, and temperature. Therefore, the wear and fatigue life of lead screw actuators cannot be modeled without a simultaneous consideration of solid mechanics, fluid dynamics, contact mechanics, and thermal dynamics. ^ A great deal of research has been conducted in the past fifty years in the estimation of sliding wear involving metal and polymer interfaces. In this thesis, the wear and fatigue life of a lead screw actuator are modeled and validated. ^ First, the asperity contact theory and Archard 2 ̆ 7 s model of sliding wear are applied to estimate the amount of wear under given conditions. Then, a test platform is developed based on a standard ASTM test protocol and the wear in ball-on-flat sliding is measured to validate the developed wear model. Simultaneously, fatigue life testing of the lead screw actuators is performed in order to verify the experimental life against the theoretical life. Next, finite element analysis is carried out using Nei-Nastran Software in order to assess the contact stresses in the lead screw and nut assembly model. Finally, the data generated from the three sources is merged to formulate a mathematical model that can predict the wear and fatigue life of a <b>lead-screw</b> actuator. ...|$|E

40|$|Electrical {{discharge}} machining is a non-contact process based on thermoelectric energy between the electrode and workpiece.

40|$|Abstract – A mobile in vivo camera robot was {{developed}} to provide the ability for a single port biopsy procedure. Such a robot can be inserted into the abdominal cavity through a standard trocar. The surgeon controls the robot using visual feedback from the on-board camera. Measurements were made to identify the forces required to successfully biopsy in vivo tissue, including clamping and tearing forces. The robot design {{was developed}} around these parameters {{and the need to}} traverse the abdominal environment using specially designed wheels. This mobility allows the biopsy robot to move to the area of interest to sample specific tissues. The <b>lead-screw</b> linkage system that actuated the graspers allows for large force production through careful mechanical design. In vivo testing of this system in a porcine (pig) model has been successful.

40|$|The Skywalker {{as found}} in MIT's Newman lab is a device that {{performs}} Body Weight Support Treadmill Therapy a form of walking therapy for recovering stroke patients. During clinical trials conducted {{in the fall of}} 2014, it became evident that the design of the Skywalker did not fully address how patients would mount and dismount the Skywalker. The current iteration of the design requires the patients to use stairs to mount and dismount the system. Given the gait impairment of the patients using the system it is evident that an alternative must be provided for the stairs {{in order to make the}} Skywalker accessible to severe stroke patients. The following thesis explores the idea of using a <b>lead-screw</b> driven platform lift to solve the problem. While the solution developed during the design process is a viable option, the high material cost disqualifies the solution discussed in this thesis as a viable option for implementation in the Skywalker system. The author recommends that alternative solutions such as ramps may provide a more low-cost and effective option for mounting and dismounting the Skywalker. by Simon A. Okaine. Thesis: S.

40|$|Ridge, TN is {{investigating}} replacing the existing proprietary CNC machine tool controllers with new controllers {{based on personal}} computer (PC) technologies. It is now possible to buy machine tool controllers that utilize PC hardware with common plug-in motion control cards that offer functionality equivalent to the 1980 s-vintage controllers currently being used. One of the controllers being considered is developed by Manufacturing Data Systems, Inc. (MDSI) of Ann Arbor, Michigan. A characteristic that sets it apart from other PC-based controllers is that it utilizes no motion control cards. It is a software-based controller, {{which means that the}} motion control servo loop is closed by the PC’s central processing unit. The controller software is called OpenCNC, and it currently runs under two operating systems: Windows NT from Microsoft Corporation and QNX from QNX Software Systems Ltd. An area of particular interest to the Y- 12 Plant is OpenCNC’s ability to support software compensation of machine tool errors other than the <b>lead-screw</b> compensation currently implemented.

40|$|A {{proposed}} three-degree-of-freedom (tilt/tip/piston) manipulator, {{suitable for}} aligning an optical or mechanical component, would offer several advantages over prior such manipulators: Unlike {{in some other}} manipulators, no actuator would support the weight of another actuator: All of the actuators would be mounted on a base. Hence, there would be less manipulated weight. The basic geometry of the manipulator would afford mechanical advantage: that is, actuator motions would be larger than the motions they produce in the manipulated object. Mechanical advantage inherently increases the accuracy and resolution of manipulation. Unlike in some other manipulators, {{it would not be}} necessary to route power and/or data lines through manipulator joints. The proposed manipulator (see figure) would include three prismatic actuators (T 1 N 1, T 2 N 2, and T 3 N 3) mounted on the base and operating in the same plane. Examples of suitable prismatic actuators include <b>lead-screw</b> mechanisms, linear hydraulic motors, piezoelectric linear drives, inchworm-movement linear stepping motors, and linear flexure drives. The actuators would control the lengths of links R 1 T 1, R 2 T 2, and R 3 T 3. Three spherical joints (P 1, P 2, and P 3) would be located at the corners of an equilateral triangle of side length q on the platform holding the object to be manipulated. Three inextensible limbs (R 1 P 1, R 2 P 2, and R 3 P 3) having length r would connect the spherical joints on the platform to revolute joints (R 1, R 2, and R 3) at the ends of the actuator-controlled links R 1 T 1, R 2 T 2, and R 3 T 3. By varying the lengths of these links, one could control the tilt, tip, and piston coordinates of the platform. Closed-form equations for direct or forward kinematics of the manipulator (given the lengths of the variable links, find the tilt, tip, and piston coordinates) have been derived. The equations of inverse kinematics (find the variable link lengths needed to obtain the desired tilt, tip, and piston coordinates) have also been derived...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, linear motors {{are widely}} used in machine tools to {{eliminate}} the gear re-lated problems of rotative drives with <b>lead-screw</b> transmission. With linear motors the performance increases considerably since mechanical transmission elements are re-moved. This leads to a better precision, a higher acceleration and a higher speed of the moving part. Therefore, direct drives with linear motors are increasingly used in indus-trial applications although these solutions often need higher investment costs. In industrial processing plants, raw materials are transferred into the production process, typically then they pass several processing stations and finally, the processed article {{is removed from the}} processing chain. In today’s production plants, different equipment is used for transportation and processing materials. Advantages can be ex-pected by using the same system of linear drives for transportation as well as for proc-essing materials. Hence, this dissertation discusses a proposal for process-integrated material handling based on linear drives. The integration of linear drives into the pro-duction plant calls for a new view of the production process. The integrative viewpoint where a co-design of drive and plant is introduced should be developed for future appli-cations. To fulfill the demand of a material handling system, two alternatives are compared. The first one is based on active vehicles and passive tracks and the second one is based in passive vehicles and active tracks. Advantages and disadvantages of both alternatives are discussed, considering aspects of the power supply system as well as control and communication demands. The control of Long Stator PM Linear Synchronous motors with passive, lightweight transportation units is investigated in detail. Hard- and software for an experimental setup is developed for a sectioned Long Stator Linear Motor and used to validate the proposed system. Finite Element tools are applied to introduce information into the con-trol loop about section’s transition and thrust force ripple. Field oriented control, direct flux control and resonant control are supported by the Finite Element information to suppress detent forces and achieve a smooth movement overall the track. A control method for soft transition between separately fed sections of the track without affecting the dynamic are implemented. Experimental results validate the proposed system and it opens a new application area for the linear drives in future...|$|E
40|$|The Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) will {{be placed}} in an orbit that will subject it to {{constant}} solar radiation during its planned 10 -year mission. A sunshield {{will be necessary to}} passively cool the telescope, protecting it from the Sun s energy and assuring proper operating temperatures for the telescope s instruments. This sunshield will be composed of metalized polymer multilayer insulation with an outer polymer membrane (12 to 25 mm in thickness) that will be metalized on the back to assure maximum reflectance of sunlight. The sunshield must maintain mechanical integrity and optical properties for the full 10 years. This durability requirement is most challenging for the outermost, constantly solar-facing polymer membrane of the sunshield. One of the potential threats to the membrane material s durability is from vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation in wavelengths below 200 nm. Such radiation can be absorbed in the bulk of these thin polymer membrane materials and degrade the polymer s optical and mechanical properties. So that a suitable membrane material can be selected that demonstrates durability to solar VUV radiation, ground-based testing of candidate materials must be conducted to simulate the total 10 - year VUV exposure expected during the Next Generation Space Telescope mission. The Steady State Vacuum Ultraviolet exposure facility was designed and fabricated at the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field to provide unattended 24 -hr exposure of candidate materials to VUV radiation of 3 to 5 times the Sun s intensity in the wavelength range of 115 to 200 nm. The facility s chamber, which maintains a pressure of approximately 5 10 (exp - 6) torr, is divided into three individual exposure cells, each with a separate VUV source and sample-positioning mechanism. The three test cells are separated by a water-cooled copper shield plate assembly to minimize thermal effects from adjacent test cells. Part of the interior sample positioning mechanism of one test cell is shown in the illustration. Of primary concern in VUV exposure is the maintenance of constant measured radiation intensity so that the sample s total exposure can be determined in equivalent Sun hours. This is {{complicated by the fact that}} a VUV lamp s intensity degrades over time, necessitating a decrease in the distance between the test samples and the lamp. The facility overcomes this challenge by periodically measuring the lamp s intensity with a cesium-iodide phototube and adjusting the sample distance as required to maintain constant exposure intensity. Sample positioning and periodic phototube location under the lamp are both achieved by a single <b>lead-screw</b> assembly. The lamps can be isolated from the main vacuum chamber for cleaning or replacement so that samples are not exposed to the atmosphere during a test...|$|E
40|$|Machine-tool axes for {{high-speed}} machining make great {{demands on the}} mechanical system, the actuators, and the numerical control. They require a high stiffness, a high bandwidth, and a precise motion at maximum speed. Linear motors as direct drives for machine-tool axes provide the basis to fulfil these requirements. They eliminate the gear-related problems of rotary drives with <b>lead-screw</b> transmission (from rotary to linear motion). In research and industrial projects, linear drives are already successfully implemented for machine-tool axes. From {{the point of view}} of control, the accurate and low-noise estimation of the axis speed is a key issue. Due to the high bandwidths required, high sampling frequencies are employed. The estimation of the drive speed by differentiation of the measured position is sensitive to position quantization at high sampling frequencies. All position-based speed estimation methods involve a trade-off between delay and quantization noise on the estimated speed. Delay limits the achievable control bandwidth. Noise leads to audible control noise and might excite structural resonances. It limits the maximum values of the feedback gains and thus also limits the bandwidth. Given a certain position resolution, a substantial reduction of quantization effects is only possible at the expense of a reduction of the stiffness. A further increase in position resolution limits the maximum axis speed with today's position encoders. This is not desired and other solutions have to be found. A survey of different sensors for linear-axis control describes the state of the art. As a result, the use of acceleration measurement in addition to the position measurement for high-precision speed estimation is proposed. The commonly used aerospace methods of combining position with acceleration to obtain a high-precision speed estimate (complementary filters, Kalman filters) raise design and realisation problems for linear-axis applications. Therefore, we propose a novel method of accelerometer-enhanced speed estimation (AESE). This method lowers the demands on the position resolutions considerably. Generally speaking, the low frequency components are extracted from the position measurement and the high frequency components from the acceleration signal by observing the two measurements over a certain time period in the past. This solution is not sensitive to accelerometer measurement noise. Its design consists in the choice of one design parameter, the observation period length. The design is very easy, as the resulting speed quality is not very sensitive to this parameter. An analysis of the closed-loop system demonstrates that, by the use of accelerometer-enhanced speed estimation, the position quantization influence on the speed feedback path is equalised to the one of the position feedback path. Therefore, high controller bandwidths and thus high sampling frequencies are possible without noise on the speed signal. On-line identification algorithms for the accelerometer gain and offset parameter, which are proposed in this dissertation, simplify commissioning of the system with the additional accelerometers. They are based on the proposed AESE-method. Low-cost inertial accelerometers are used for the experimental validation of the proposed algorithms on real linear-drive axes. They demonstrate that the AESE-algorithm provides an accurate, low-noise speed estimate with a delay in the range of the delay of the direct position differentiation over one sampling period. Altogether, the proposed AESE-method is well-suited for an industrial application because of the high quality of the obtained speed signal, the simple design, the low cost, the low measurement-noise sensitivity, and the on-line parameter identification...|$|E
