40|$|Global poultry {{production}} is plagued {{by a wide}} variety of arthropods. The problems associated with their chemical control have led to an increasing search for control alternatives, and entomopathogenic fungi seem to be a promising strategy. Despite the large number of insects and mites considered as important pests in animal production, studies on the use of entomopathogenic fungi for their control are still scarce compared with agricultural pests, particularly in Brazil. This article reviews some damages and control aspects of the main arthropod pests that affect Brazilian {{poultry production}}, including house flies, <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworms,</b> and feather mites, by the use of the entomopathogenic fungi Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae.

40|$|Campylobacter spp. {{are well}} {{recognized}} food-borne pathogens, causative agents of enteritis in humans, and currently representing a relevant public health problem. Poultry {{is the main}} reservoir of campylobacters and plays a relevant role in the transmission of infection to humans. Since epidemiology of Campylobacter in turkeys has been scarcely investigated, we carried out a study aimed to identify the potential sources and vehicles of Campylobacter infection in commercial meat turkey farms. A longitudinal sampling strategy was adopted over a 1 -year period, including 2 meat turkey farms rearing 2 turkey flocks each. Meconium was collected from day-old chicks at the hatchery and then faecal swabs were collected three times at the farm (beginning, middle {{and end of the}} cycle). Farm sampling consisted of drinking water samples (in-house collection tank, water line and drinkers), surface swabs (anteroom door and ventilation system), air, overshoe samples in the anteroom and inside the house, mice and insects (flies, beetles and <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworms).</b> In each farm a target turkey house was selected, where the monitoring continued for the following production cycle. Water and environmental samples were also harvested during downtime. Isolation and identification of Campylobacter were performed as previously described by Giacomelli et al. (2012), slightly modified. Except for day-old chicks, C. jejuni and C. coli were isolated from birds throughout the entire cycle. C. coli was predominant over C. jejuni. Both Campylobacter species were also isolated during the production cycle from overshoe samples inside the house, water from drinkers, flies, and <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworms.</b> Downtime sampling gave always negative results. Water from collection tank was always negative, as well as air from inside the house, and surface swabs. These findings suggest that vertical transmission seems not to be an important source of flock infection, whereas horizontal transmission should be considered the major route for colonization of turkeys, as campylobacters were found in several environmental sources. Ongoing genotyping of isolates by Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) will strengthen the association between isolates from turkeys and from environmental sources...|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{microbial}} dynamics during an industrial production cyle of <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworms</b> (Alphitobius diaperinus), sold for human consumption, were characterised. The microbial numbers {{as well as}} {{the microbial}} diversity were generally higher for the substrate, existing of remaining feed, faeces and exuviae, than for the larvae. Most of the species-level operational taxonomic units, identified using Illumina MiSeq sequencing, that were present in the feed were also detected in the larvae and vice versa. However, bacterial diversity decreased in the larvae during rearing. These results suggested that the feed is an important determinant of the insect bacterial community, but that some bacterial species show a competitive advantage inside the insect gut and become dominant. A blanching treatment of the larvae after harvest reduced most microbial counts, but the number of aerobic endospores remained at 4. 0 log cfu/g. Whereas food pathogens Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus or coagulase-positive staphylococci were not detected in our study, fungal isolates corresponding to the genera Aspergillus and Fusarium were recovered. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that mycotoxins were present.

40|$|Since {{epidemiology}} of thermophilic campylobacters in turkeys {{has been}} scarcely investigated, we carried out longitudinal studies aimed at identifying potential sources and vehicles of Campylobacter infection in commercial meat turkey farms. A preliminary sampling in turkey breeders flocks {{was carried out}} in order to detect a Campylobacter-positive flock. Then, a monitoring of 2 meat turkey farms rearing the progeny of the positive turkey breeders flocks was performed. Meconium was collected from day-old chicks at the hatchery and then faecal swabs were collected three times at the farm (at the beginning, middle and end of the production cycle). Farm sampling consisted of multiple drinking water samples, surface swabs, air, overshoe samples in the anteroom and inside the house, and insects. Sampling was also carried out during downtime. Isolation and identification of Campylobacter spp. were performed by a conventional culture method and a multiplex end-point PCR assay, respectively. Day-old chicks tested negative for thermophilic campylobacters, whereas C. jejuni and C. coli were subsequently isolated from birds throughout the entire cycle in all flocks except for one. Both Campylobacter species were also frequently isolated from drinkers, flies and <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworms.</b> Water, air from inside the house, and surface swabs were always negative.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} the high production and export rates achieved by the Brazilian poultry industry, it is necessary to prevent and control certain disease agents, such as Salmonella spp. Using bacterial cultures, the aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the prevalence of Salmonella spp. in specimens collected from broiler facilities. Local wild birds were also sampled, as well as the feces of swine housed on the poultry farm. After sample collection, the isolated serotypes were subsequently inoculated into broiler chicks to determine their effects. Positive samples were collected from the following locations in the poultry facilities: poultry litter (S. serotype 4, 5, 12 :R:-; S. Heidelberg; S. Infantis), broiler feces (S. Heidelberg; S. serotype 6, 7 :R:-; S. serotype 4, 5, 12 :R:-; S. Tennessee), water (S.

Salmonella Panama and Salmonella Typhimurium were isolated from swine feces. One-day-old chicks (150) were divided into 10 groups of 15 animals each. Each group was orally inoculated with a previously isolated serotype of Salmonella. Soft stools were observed on the cage floor and around the birds' cloaca between 3 and 12 days post-infection (dpi).

40|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm,</b> Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), is a serious, {{cosmopolitan}} pest {{present in}} poultry production facilities, where it slows down weight gain in chicks, carries disease–causing organisms, and causes damage to poultry insulation. The first study {{estimated that the}} <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm</b> densities in poultry litter applied to pastures were 3. 5, 2. 2 and 0. 4 million larvae, adults and pupae, respectively, per hectare in Savoy, Arkansas. The repercussions of these adult beetles are that they often disperse to and reinfest poultry houses {{with the potential to}} vector disease to poultry, and disperse to invade human dwellings resulting in litigation. The second experiment noted an initial increase in beetle trap catches after heat was turned on in the poultry house in preparation for placement of chicks. There was a reduction in sampled densities of beetles shortly after chick placement. These observations will help decision making regarding <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm</b> sampling and timing pesticide use. The third experiment consisted of two behavioral bioassays. In field experiments, significantly higher numbers of beetles were found in pitfall traps treated with the <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm</b> aggregation pheromone lure as compared to untreated checks. The laboratory two–choice pitfall trap bioassay found a combination of the aggregation pheromone and chicken droppings (CD) to be attractive to <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm</b> larvae and adults than either odor source alone. Results indicate the potential for combining the synthetic pheromone lure with the potential attractive CD compounds to enhance trap efficacy. The fourth objective determined respective percent mortalities and baseline dose-responses of beetles to three different classes of insect growth regulators (IGRs) including fenoxycarb, diflubenzuron, and 20 –hydroxyecdysone, through topical, residual contact and feeding bioassays. In feeding bioassays, fenoxycarb and diflubenzuron were more toxic to 1 st instars than 7 th instars or adults, whereas ecdysone was equally more toxic to 1 st instars and 7 th instars than to adults. The feeding bioassay was more suitable for the 1 st and 7 th instar stages than adults. The residual contact bioassay exhibited slightly less percent mortality of 7 th instars and adults but this bioassay most closely simulated field application of insecticides. All three bioassay methods produced usable dose-response curves for 7 th instar and adults and may be used for surveying temporal changes in the IGR susceptibility to <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm...</b>|$|E

40|$|Distributions of <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm,</b> Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), in {{litter of}} a {{compacted}} earth floor broiler house in southeastern Queensland, Australia, were studied over two flocks. Larvae were the predominant stage recorded. Significantly low densities occurred in open locations and under drinker cups where chickens had complete access, whereas high densities were found under feed pans and along house edges where chicken access was restricted. For each flock, <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm</b> numbers increased at all locations {{over the first}} 14 d, especially under feed pans and along house edges, peaking at 26 d and then declining over the final 28 d. A life stage profile per flock was devised that consisted of the following: beetles emerge from the earth floor {{at the beginning of}} each flock, and females lay eggs, producing larvae that peak in numbers at 3 wk; after a further 3 to 4 wk, larvae leave litter to pupate in the earth floor, and beetles then emerge by the end of the flock time. Removing old litter from the brooder section at the end of a flock did not greatly reduce mealworm numbers over the subsequent flock, but it seemed to prevent numbers increasing, while an increase in numbers in the grow-out section was recorded after reusing litter. Areas under feed pans and along house edges accounted for 5 % of the total house area, but approximately half the estimated total number of lesser mealworms in the broiler house occurred in these locations.

40|$|ABSTRACT The phenological events {{occurring}} in {{various types of}} insulation during infestation by Alphitobius diaperinus were studied under laboratory conditions. Late instar larval A. diaperinus initiated tunneling behavior into polystyrene insulation. Adult female beetles utilized {{the surface of the}} polystyrene panels as oviposition sites, but early instar larvae left the panels soon after hatching. Within 20 days after placing the panels into laboratory colonies, large numbers of adults moved from the media into the polystyrene expanding the tunnels. Concurrently, the number of late instar larvae recovered from the insulation declined. No oviposition occurred within the tunnels. Few middle instar larvae were present in the polystyrene. All lifestages of A. diaperinus invaded exposed fiberglass, but invading late instar larvae did not pupate successfully. Polystyrene seemed to be preferred by late instar larvae over polyurethane for pupation sites, but polyurethane was favored over polystyrene by ovipositing beetles.

Susceptibility of the <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm</b> collected from eight poultry houses in Paraná state, southern Brazil, was evaluated for cypermethrin, dichlorvos and triflumuron. Adult A. diaperinus were tested in bioassays with cypermethrin and dichlorvos. Larvae were fed rabbit feed wetted with a triflumuron-water solution.

40|$|ABSTRACT Beauveria bassiana is {{naturally}} found in broiler chicken houses, {{and has been}} shown to be active against the <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm,</b> Alphitobius diaperinus. The effectiveness of soil application of B. bassiana in emulsifiable oil-type formulation (Unioeste 4 isolate) to control the <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm</b> in commercial poultry house was evaluated. The fungus was applied to the dirt floor of poultry house at 4. 2 × 109 conidia/m 2 (treated aviary) and the insect population was assessed before and 96, 146 and 216 days after application (DAA). In the control aviary, no treatment was performed to control those insects. Molecular techniques were used to confirm the presence of the fungus in dead A. diaperinus. Significant treatment effects were observed, with 56 % and 73 % of insect population reduction on 96 and 146 DAA, respectively. However, on 216 DDA, insect population resumed to values close to those initially observed. In the control aviary, the population grew steadily, reaching almost 110 % the initial population on 96 DAA, and close to 200 % on 216 DDA.

40|$|Abstract Knowledge of the {{population}} fluctuation and spatial distribution of pests is fundamental for establishing an appropriate control method. The population fluctuation and spatial distribution of the Alphitobius diaperinus in a poultry house in Cascavel, {{in the state of}} Parana, Brazil, was studied between October, 2001 and October 2002. Larvae and adults of the <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm</b> were sampled weekly using Arends tube traps (n = 22) for six consecutive flock grow-outs. The temperature of the litter and of the poultry house was measured at the same locations of the tube traps. Beetle numbers increased continuously throughout all the sampling dates (average 5, 137 in the first week and 18, 494 insects on the sixth week). Significantly greater numbers of larvae were collected than adults (1 to 20 times in 95 % of the sampling points). There was no correlation between temperature and the number of larvae and adults collected, therefore no fluctuation was observed during the sampling period. The population growth was correlated to litter re-use. The highest temperatures were observed in deep litter. The spatial distribution of larvae and adults in the poultry house was heterogeneous during the whole period of evaluation. Results suggest that monitoring in poultry houses is necessary prior to adopting and evaluating control measures due to the great variability of the insect distribution in the poultry house.

40|$|Factors that {{influence}} the localized abundance and distribution of <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm,</b> Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer), in litter of two compacted earth-floor broiler houses in subtropical Australia were studied using various experimental manipulations. Numbers of lesser mealworms substantially increased inside caged areas and under uncaged empty feed pans placed in open areas of the houses. These populations {{were found to be}} localized and independent of chicken-feed, manure, and high beetle populations that normally occur under existing feed pans. Substantial horizontal movement of larvae to under feed pans was recorded. Placing metal barriers around these pans significantly restricted this movement. In almost all treatments, lesser mealworms typically peaked in numbers {{during the middle of the}} flock time. This temporal pattern of abundance also was observed under pans within barriers, where relatively low insect numbers occurred, but it was not observed in uncaged open areas (where chickens had complete access). It is likely that larvae do not establish in open areas, but fluctuate in numbers as they either move to refuges away from chickens or suffer high rates of mortality. In these refuges, larvae peak in numbers and then leave the litter environment to pupate in the earth floor before the end of the flock time. This behavior might be exploited for management of <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm</b> by targeting applications of control agents...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathogenicity}} of insect-pathogenic hyphomycetous isolates to the <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm</b> Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) {{was tested}} in this study. Thirty isolates of Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin, Paecilomyces amoenoroseus (Hennings), P. fumosoroseus (Wize) Brown & Smith, P. lilacinus (Thom) Samson, P. tenuipes (Petch) Samson, Metarhizium anisopliae (Metschnikoff) Sorokin, and M. anisopliae var. acridum were initially screened by sprinkling dry conidia onto adult A. diaperinus or by allowing adults {{to walk on}} Petri dishes with sporulating fungal isolates. The two most virulent isolates, CNPSo-Ma 352 (M. anisopliae) and CNPSo-Ma 356 (M. anisopliae), killed 30 % and 26. 7 % of the dry-conidia treated adults, respectively. These two isolates were selected for LD 50 bioassays. LD 50 of CNPSo-Ma 352 was 4. 5 x 10 (4) conidia per larva, and 2. 1 x 10 (5) conidia per adult, and for strain CNPSo-Ma 356, LD 50 was 2. 2 x 10 (4) conidia per larva and 1. 3 x 10 (5) conidia per adult. Larvae were 5 - 6 times more susceptible than adults. A larger number of conidia required to cause 50 % mortality in insect evaluates, suggesting the reduced susceptibility of A. diaperinus to entomopathogenic fungi.

40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of six Australian {{broiler house}} populations and an insecticide susceptible population of <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm,</b> Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), to cyfluthrin, beta-cyfluthrin, gamma-cyhalothrin, and deltamethrin was investigated. One broiler house population had equivalent susceptibility to the susceptible to beta-cyfluthrin and gamma-cyhalothrin, with higher susceptibility to cyfluthrin and deltamethrin. The remaining five populations demonstrated strong resistance to cyfluthrin (19 - 37 -fold), the insecticide used most widely for management of A. diaperinus in Australia. Each cyfluthrin-resistant population demonstrated reduced susceptibility to beta-cyfluthrin (resistance ratios were 8 - 17 -fold), deltamethrin (2. 5 - 8 -fold), and gamma-cyhalothrin (6 - 12 -fold) {{compared with the}} laboratory population, but cross-resistance patterns varied considerably between populations. Adding piperonyl butoxide (PBO) {{had no effect on}} the susceptibility of the susceptible population to any of the insecticides, but it increased the susceptibility of each of the five cyfluthrin-resistant populations: to cyfluthrin (synergism ratio range, 1. 9 - 5. 0 -fold), beta-cyfluthrin (1. 6 - 4. 1 -fold), and gamma-cyhalothrin (1. 7 - 2. 0 -fold). PBO had a more variable effect on susceptibility to deltamethrin, with three of the cyfluthrin-resistant populations being more susceptible to deltamethrin in the presence of PBO, but susceptibility of the remaining two populations was unaffected by adding PBO (synergism ratio range, 0. 9 - 2. 5 -fold). Overall, the addition of PBO to the four pyrethroids had variable effects on their susceptibility. This variability indicated the presence of other resistance mechanisms in beetle populations apart from metabolic resistance. In addition, the relative importance of metabolic resistance in each beetle population varied widely between pyrethroids. Thus, it cannot be assumed that PBO will reliably synergize pyrethroids against cyfluthrin-resistant <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm</b> populations when using it to mitigate insecticide resistance...|$|E

Efficacy of each agent was assessed by regular sampling of litter and counting of immature stages and adult beetles, and comparing insect counts in treatments to counts in untreated houses. Generally, the lowest numbers of <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm</b> were recorded {{in the house with}} hard floors, these numbers equalling the most effective spinosad applications. The most effective treatment was a strategic application of spinosad under feed supply lines on a hard floor. In compacted earth floor houses, mean numbers of lesser mealworms for two under-feed-line spinosad treatments (i. e., 2 -m-wide application at 0. 18 g of active insecticide (g [AI]) in 100 -ml water/m(2), and 1 -m-wide application at 0. 11 g ([AI] in 33 -ml water/m(2)), and an entire floor spinosad treatment (0. 07 g [AI] in 86 -ml water/m 2) were significantly lower (i. e., better control) than those numbers for cyfluthrin, and no treatment (controls). The 1 -m-wide under-feed-line treatment was the most cost-effective dose, providing similar control to the other two most effective spinosad treatments, but using less than half the active component per broiler house. No efficacy was demonstrated when spinosad was applied to the surface of bedding in relatively large volumes of water. All applications of diatomaceous earth, applied with and without spinosad, and cyfluthrin at the label rate of 0. 02 g (AI) / 100 -ml water/m(2) showed no effect, with insect counts not significantly different to untreated controls. Overall, the results of this field assessment indicate that cyfluthrin (the Australian industry standard) and diatomaceous earth were ineffective on these two farms and that spinosad can be a viable alternative for broiler house use...|$|E
40|$|A {{new culture}} method for <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm,</b> Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer), was {{developed}} to provide large numbers of adult lesser mealworms of approximately the same age for insecticide resistance testing. Culturing entailed allowing 100 adults to reproduce for 4 days in a wheat-based culture medium contained inside a plastic culture box, removing the adults from the medium, and then rearing their progeny to adulthood therein, in approximately 56 days at 32 degrees C and 55 % RH. During their development, progeny were supplied water via apple slices at 0, 21 and 35 days, and a foam substrate in which to pupate, also at 35 days. During 2004 - 2005, adult lesser mealworms were collected from six broiler-house populations and then cultured with this method. Each population produced 4500 adults required to complete resistance testing with one insecticide within ten culture boxes, {{at an average of}} 798 adults per culture box...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHistomonas meleagridis is a {{protozoa}} causing histomoniasis, {{a disease}} of gallinaceous fowl. With the aim to evaluate whether the <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm,</b> Alphitobius diaperinus, is capable of harboring H. meleagridis, {{the presence of the}} parasite was tested by PCR in lesser mealworms collected in the field. Parasite DNA was detected in two larvae coming from two farms undergoing an outbreak of histomoniasis. Insects were also artificially infected, killed after an incubation period and analyzed by PCR to verify the presence of parasite DNA. After 4 days, two larvae (out of 20) remained positive. Another experimental infection was performed to investigate the viability of histomonads in the larvae. Four days after infection, living parasites were detected in 5 larvae (out of 20). These results show that A. diaperinus have a low susceptibility to infection and would probably not be able to maintain the contamination between two flocks except accidentally...|$|E
40|$|To isolate {{potential}} insect biocontrol agents, entomogenous nematodes {{were surveyed}} in Tennessee plant nurseries in 1991. Soil samples from 113 nursery sites were baited with {{greater wax moth}} (Galleria mellonella) larvae, house cricket (Acheta domesticus) adults, <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm</b> (Alphitobius diaperings) adults, and house fly (Musca domestica) larvae. Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and Steinernema carpocapsae were each recovered from 17 soil samples. Heterorhabditis bacteriophora was more common in habitats with crape myrtle (Lagerstroemia indica) and Chinese juniper (Juniperus chinensis) than other nursery plants, and S. carpocapsae was more frequently recovered from habitats with juniper and Southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora). Bulk density, electrical conductivity, organic matter, pH, temperature, and moisture content of the entomogenous-nematode positive soil samples were compared. Other nematode genera recovered with insect baits included Rhabditis sp., Pelodera sp., Cryptaphelenchoides sp., and Mesodiplogaster sp., which was recovered from {{a greater percentage of}} soil samples than the other five genera...|$|E
40|$|For {{approximately}} three decades the Australian broiler industry has {{relied heavily on}} the use of insecticides as its key tool for management of darkling beetle or <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm,</b> Alphitobius diaperinus [Panzer] in broiler houses. The use of these chemicals over this period has been largely unchecked which has resulted in the development of strong insecticide resistance in many beetle populations from broiler farms. Although we are in a period now with an improved knowledge of managing resistance and the availability of new more effective insecticides that are currently marketed, the industry still requires more pest management options in order to inhibit development of resistance and reduce overall chemical use. In response to this need, ‘natural’ agents such as entomopathogenic nematodes and fungi were proposed as potential agents for managing darkling beetle populations in Australian broiler houses. Since 2007 laboratory and field studies have been undertaken to assess these agents. This report outlines these studies and discusses potential benefits to the Chicken Meat industry resulting from this research...|$|E
40|$|The beetle Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer), {{considered}} a worldwide pest in the poultry industry, {{is difficult to}} control {{and it is a}} vector for pathogens. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the biological control of the <b>lesser</b> <b>mealworm,</b> by strains of fungi Beauveria bassiana, Cladosporium sp. and Trichoderma sp. Larvae and adults of the A. diaperinus were inoculated with suspensions of conidia in the concentration of 10 (7) conídia. mL- 1. The B. bassiana isolate caused higher insect mortality as compared to Cladosporium sp. and Trichoderma sp. isolates, with the larvae being more susceptible than adults. The entomopathogenicity of B. bassiana was further evaluated with 200 larvae and 200 adults of A. diaperinus inoculated with suspensions 10 (6), 10 (7), and 10 (8) conidia. mL- 1, and observed for ten days. Larvae mortality started at the fourth day at the lowest concentration, and the adult mortality was only observed on the sixth day at the concentration of 10 (8) conidia. mL- 1...|$|E
