5|$|Mr. Steinitz stands {{high as a}} {{theoretician}} and as a writer; he has {{a powerful}} pen, and when he chooses can use expressive English. He evidently strives {{to be fair to}} friends and foes alike, but appears sometimes to fail to see that after all he is much <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> in this respect. Possessed of a fine intellect, and extremely fond of the game, he is apt to lose sight of all other considerations, people and business alike. Chess is his very life and soul, the one thing for which he lives.|$|E
5|$|I {{must confess}} that, <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For years I was {{put off by the}} aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it. It was the kind of book presented on prize-giving days, and I saw it as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E
5|$|Promoted {{to major}} on 8 June, Morshead {{distinguished}} {{himself in the}} Battle of Lone Pine on 6 August. So intense was the fighting that of the 22 officers in the battalion, Morshead {{was the only one}} who did not become a casualty. However, on 16 September, <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> he succumbed to dysentery and paratyphoid fever. He was evacuated to the 3rd General Hospital on Lemnos, and then to England on the hospital ship Aquitania, where he was admitted to the 3rd London General Hospital in Wandsworth, England. For his services in the Gallipoli campaign, he was mentioned in despatches.|$|E

5|$|A {{major source}} of income was the export of wool. However, the fourteenth century saw a change in fortunes: the Black Death, a {{worsening}} economic climate and poor administration left the abbey (<b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> of its order) with sharply declining numbers of monks and saddled with major debt. The internal discipline and morals of the community declined too: in 1400–01 it was reported to the government that the abbot of Cleeve and three other monks were leading a group of 200 bandits and attacking travellers in the region. However, things improved {{in the fifteenth century}} and despite the vast expense caused by the extravagant building projects of the last abbots, better management, access to new resources (for instance from the profits from the right to hold markets granted by the crown) and a general improvement in the circumstances facing the house meant that just prior to the dissolution Cleeve was enjoying an Indian Summer of comfortable stability.|$|E
25|$|A {{compound}} {{is a word}} {{composed of}} more than one free morpheme. The English language, <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> uses compounds frequently. English compounds may be classified in several ways, such as the word classes or the semantic relationship of their components.|$|E
25|$|After the war Gonzalez {{pursued a}} variety of vocations, {{all of which were}} {{marginally}} successful, but <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> he never provided the security he sought for his extended family. His efforts were similar to those of other formerly wealthy Southerners who sought to recover their estates and social status.|$|E

25|$|Bob Gerard {{was born}} into a family well acquainted with {{mechanical}} transport. His family's business was Parr's Ltd., initially a bicycle manufacturer who, <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> such as Triumph, moved into the newly evolving motor vehicle market {{at the turn of the}} 20th century. Parr's, though, was far from a high-performance firm, concentrating mostly on haulage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Like</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> in Guerrero, archeological sites {{along the}} Costa Grande {{do not have}} {{security}} {{due to the lack}} of resources. Many of the sites suffer from sacking by the local populations who sell items they find. Many of these items eventually find their way abroad. One serious example of this is a site in San Jerónimo, where local sacked a zone which contains stele.|$|E
25|$|In 610 Muhammad started {{preaching the}} message of Islam. <b>Like</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> in Mecca, Umar opposed Islam and he even {{threatened}} to kill Muhammad. He resolved to defend the traditional polytheistic religion of Arabia. He was adamant and cruel in opposing Muhammad and very prominent in persecuting Muslims. He recommended Muhammad's death. He firmly believed in {{the unity of the}} Quraish and saw the new faith of Islam as a cause of division and discord.|$|E

25|$|Colonel Ambrosio José Gonzales {{pursued a}} variety of vocations, {{all of which were}} {{marginally}} successful, but <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> he never provided the security he sought for his extended family. His efforts were similar to those of other formerly wealthy Southerners who sought to recover their estates and social status. Gonzales faced not only financial loss but also sorrows over the death of his wife and his sister-in-law's successful efforts to poison the relationships between Gonzales and his children.|$|E
25|$|In September 1873, Jay Cooke & Company, a major {{component}} of the United States banking establishment, found itself unable to market several million dollars in Northern Pacific Railway bonds. Cooke's firm, <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> had invested heavily in the railroads. At a time when investment banks were anxious for more capital for their enterprises, President Ulysses S. Grant's monetary policy of contracting the money supply (again, also thereby raising interest rates) made matters worse for those in debt. While businesses were expanding, the money they needed to finance that growth was becoming scarcer.|$|E
25|$|A {{fair number}} are present, {{often on the}} higher reaches of the rivers. Some are named, such as Lizzie's Linn at Caven Mill, Montgreenan, on the Lugton Water. The Cessnock Water has a number on its course through the woods at the Carnell estate near Fiveways outside Kilmarnock. A series of low waterfalls occur at Cunnighamhead on the Annick Water, these being, <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> dykes that are more {{resistant}} to erosion than the surrounding rocks. Other notable waterfalls are on the Polbaith burn, Fenwick Water (near Rigghill), Glen water (Darvel) and Burn Anne.|$|E

25|$|Another {{commemorative}} {{monument to}} La Fontaine {{was set up}} {{at the head of}} the Parisian Jardin du Ranelagh in 1891. The bronze bust designed by Achille Dumilâtre was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle (1889) before being placed on a high stone pedestal surrounded by various figures from the fables. The work was melted down, <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> during World War II, but was replaced in 1983 by Charles Correia’s standing statue of the fabulist looking down at the fox and the crow on the steps and plinth below him.|$|E
25|$|Another source {{states that}} she was a pious young woman – a devout Covenanter – and, hearing of the martyrdom of Margaret Wilson (in 1684 or 1685) on Wigtown Sands, and being {{determined}} not to renounce the Covenant, she fled, <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> from her home in Ayrshire to Ireland, and found employment in the county Down, where she acquired a knowledge of the Irish process of cheese making. The persecution of females having abated after the horrible event of Wigtown Sands, Miss Gilmour returned to her home in Dunlop, and became a farmer’s wife.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known film {{adaptation of}} Wuthering Heights was filmed in England in 1920 {{and it was}} directed by A. V. Bramble. It is unknown if any prints still exist. The most famous was 1939's Wuthering Heights, starring Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon and directed by William Wyler. This acclaimed adaptation, <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> eliminated the second generation's story (young Cathy, Linton and Hareton) and is rather inaccurate as a literature adaption. It won the 1939 New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Film and was nominated for the 1939 Academy Award for Best Picture.|$|E

25|$|Inzunza Inzunza {{was born}} in Culiacán, Sinaloa, Mexico on 17 August 1971. His father René Inzunza was from La Vuelta, a rural {{community}} close to Culiacán; <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> {{who lived in the}} Sinaloan countryside, his father was involved in the drug trade, but he died when Inzunza Inzunza was still a teenager. Born into a middle-class family, Inzunza Inzunza attended grade and middle school at Colegio Sinaloa, a religious institution. He committed his first homicide when he was 19; one night during a party at his house, he shot a man dead after the man laughed at him. He fled thereafter to the state of Sonora and got involved in drug trafficking and organized crime.|$|E
25|$|During {{this period}} the flourishing of Dutch {{painters}} became {{emblematic of the}} Golden Age in Dutch culture. At the time, this was just an industry <b>like</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> with offshoots like chemical pigment making. Its rise illustrates the general boom conditions in the country, like the horticultural developments that laid {{the basis for the}} sophisticated tulip farming sector (which had its own speculative bubble, known as the tulip mania). By 1636 the tulip bulb became the fourth leading export product of the Netherlands – after gin, herring and cheese. The price of tulips skyrocketed because of speculation in tulip futures among people who never saw the bulbs. Many men made and lost fortunes overnight, to the consternation of Calvinists who abhorred this artificial frenzy that denied the virtues of moderation, discretion and genuine work.|$|E
25|$|<b>Like</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> who devoted {{their life}} to {{commercial}} {{art in the}} first half of the 20th century, Denis McLoughlin was never paid a great deal for his work. Many pieces of his artwork, the Boardman book covers in particular, which Denis had been promised would be returned to him, were either lost or ended up in private collections. While he made a living, Denis never accumulated much money. Although he had a pension from the British government, he was forced to augment his income by working long past retirement age. He once commented that he never particularly liked illustrating military topics and yet that is what he found himself doing for the last 20 years of his life. Perhaps, had he been given cowboy stories to illustrate, he might have been happier.|$|E
