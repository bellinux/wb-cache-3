On the back of the rod the graduation decrease from 13.09 ft at the bottom to 7 ft. The division of the device in two sliding sections are devised for ease of support. Readings of 7 ft or less, and up to 13 ft can be measured. It has a rear section that slides on the front section. The rod must be fully extended, when higher measurements are needed to avoid reading errors. Distances of up to 250' may be read.|$|E
40|$|Tutorialpg. 209 - 218 This paper {{outlines}} the typical problems seen in reciprocating compressors and {{shows that the}} existing type of monitoring systems, consisting of vibration <b>level,</b> <b>rod</b> drop, rod runout, and valve cap temperatures, often misses many of them. The advanced compressor monitoring system, which uses dynamic compressor cylinder pressure, directly targets these areas. This system not only provides the information available in the old type monitoring system, but provides much more information concerning the compressor?s loading, performance, and efficiency. Operators and maintenance personnel will now have much more information for critical decisions concerning letting a compressor continue in service or shutting it down to help prevent further damage. A point by point discussion {{of the type of}} data available form such a system and diagnostic information provided by each parameter is provided. Finally, several examples are presented showing the use of this type of advanced continuous monitoring system on a hydrogen compressor in a refinery setting...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to address and {{investigate}} {{some of the main}} challenges in the fields of cariology and caries management. In the first two Chapters, available literature on the formation and remineralisation of carious enamel lesions at different structural levels of enamel including microscopic tissue <b>level,</b> <b>rod</b> level and crystal level were reviewed. In Chapter 3, an approach was developed to provide quantitative and qualitative information of the carious enamel lesions in a non-subjective manner based on x-ray micro computed tomography, image de-noising and visualisation techniques. In chapter 4, a systematic study of natural fissural enamel lesions was performed using X-ray micro computed tomography and image processing methods revealing the exclusive pattern and quantifying the structural features of fissural lesions. In Chapter 5, the study of natural brown spot enamel lesions revealed the different structure and mineral pattern of brown spot lesions compared to white spot enamel lesions. Two distinguishable shapes including reverse triangular and trapezoid were the common patterns in brown spot enamel lesions. In Chapter 6 a method using high pressure homogenisation, for the preparation of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles, was developed and the efficacy of produced hydroxyapatite nanoparticles for remineralisation of artificial enamel lesions was evaluated.

40|$|Rod and cone photoreceptors {{transform}} {{information about}} incoming light into neural signals with broadly similar molecular mechanisms. Yet their sensitivity, response kinetics and adaptation properties {{are quite different}} as rods mediate dim-light vision and cones function mainly under daylight. This thesis 1. addresses the functional differences between rods and cones as well as mammalian and non-mammalian photoreceptors and 2. provides novel findings regarding the existence and regulation of rod-cone interactions at the photoreceptor <b>level.</b> <b>Rod</b> and cone photoresponses to brief flashes of light were recorded with electroretinogram (ERG) from isolated rodent and amphibian retinas. Various phototransduction models were used to compare their relevant parameters over a range of adapting conditions. The study focused on how the following physical factors shape and limit photoreceptor function: operating temperature, thermal stability of the amphibian long wavelength sensitive (A 1 -) visual pigment, outer segment dimensions, morphology and electrical connections between adjacent rods and cones. Mammalian rod photoreceptors generate faster photoresponses but light-adapt less efficiently than amphibian rods. In the rodent and anuran rods studied in this thesis, the main differences could {{be accounted for by}} the higher operating temperature and smaller outer segment size of the rodent photoreceptors. Additionally, the slender outer segments of the mammalian rods enabled sufficient quantal responses and high quantum catch despite the observed desensitizing effect of warming. Long wavelength -sensitive cone photoreceptors have been hypothesized to be desensitized by thermal excitation of their visual pigment molecules. However, it has been shown experimentally only in amphibian cones that utilize the A 2 -chromophore. The relative stability of the A 1 -based cone pigments - used by all terrestrial vertebrates - has remained unclear, as well as its role in limiting cone function. In this study, thermal isomerization rate of the long wavelength sensitive (A 1 -) visual pigment was estimated to play at most a minor role in regulating cone sensitivity of the frog Rana temporaria. Finally, ERG light responses originating in mouse cone photoreceptors were found to be suppressed in the dark-adapted retina, apparently through direct electrical coupling between rods and cones. The results indicated this coupling is weakened by moderate background light, explaining a long known phenomenon of unknown origin: light-induced growth of cone flash responses in mammalian ERG. This is indicative of a previously unknown mechanism of retinal adaptation...|$|E

In this study, we investigated how rod mediated changes in color perception varied {{as a function}} of the magnitude of the rod contrast.

40|$|Keywords: system {{calibration}} facility, digital <b>levels,</b> <b>rod</b> calibration, spirit leveling] Digital levels replaced spirit {{levels in}} most fields of precise height measurements {{because of the}} automation of the height readings. Three manufacturers offer digital levels with a single reading resolution of 10 Âµm, {{and for all of}} them systematic effects are known. In Europe several facilities for system calibration of digital levels using vertical comparators were established within the last decade. However, there still was no system calibration facility in North America. In order to guarantee the accuracy required for the alignment of experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) a calibration facility for the system calibration of digital levels was built. In this paper the setup of the SLAC vertical comparator is described in detail and its standard uncertainty is derived. In order to perform traditional rod calibration of conventional line-scaled rods, a CCD camera was integrated into the SLAC comparator. The CCD camera setup is also briefly described. To demonstrate the capabilities of the comparator, results of system and rod calibration are shown. ...|$|R
