A number of applications to rewriting and to concurrency have been presented (see [5] for a survey). TTSLI is an implementation of constraint systems, together with the main operations. It is written in Java, and is available on Lecland's web page. 2 Constraint Systems for Tuple Synchronized Languages We just give examples to recall what a CS is. Formal de nitions are given in [2].

The PB, which is well known as a stable, deep blue pigment, is a representative h xa [...] cyano-metal polynuclear complex. This type of compound is a mixed-valence complex, and often changes reversibly the redox states witbout change in the crystal structure. Therefore, such a complex can be used for both anode and cathode active material of cell. In addition, the PB is able to be electrochemically coated on electrode as a thin film (5, 6).

40|$|In this study, bacteriocins {{produced}} by Lactococcus lactis strains isolated from naturally fermented sausage in Brazil were purified and identified. PCR product sequencing {{confirmed that the}} structural bacteriocin genes of the all strains are identical to lantibiotic nisin Z. Plasmids were detected in all strains of L. lactis, and {{it was observed that}} cured derivatives from all strains were able to produce bacteriocins, indicating that the genes encoding the bacteriocin are located on the chromosome. Bacteriocins were purified to homogeneity from culture supernatants by ionic exchange and reversed-phase chromatography and their molecular masses were confirmed by MALDI-TOF/TOF. The production of the bacteriocin was investigated under different growth conditions. For all of the strains, bacteriocin production appeared to parallel cell growth and reached its maximal activity at the stationary phase. All strains produced bacteriocin efficiently at initial pH values of 6. 0 and 6. 5, under aerobic conditions and at 25 °C and 30 °C in LAPTg medium. Tryptone and casein peptone were found to be the optimal organic nitrogen source for the bacteriocin production for all strains. Carbon source appears to be a major control mechanism for nisin Z production. Sucrose was the most efficient carbon source for bacteriocin production of <b>L.</b> lactis <b>ID</b> 1. 5, ID 8. 5, PR 3. 1 and PD 4. 7, while fructose was the most efficient carbon source for strain <b>L.</b> lactis <b>ID</b> 3. 1. The strains presented different activity values of bacteriocins, maximal activity was recorded by <b>L.</b> lactis <b>ID</b> 1. 5 and ID 8. 5. The nisZ and nisF promoter sequences obtained from all strains are identical, suggesting that there should be other factors involved in difference of production of bacteriocins among those strains. In addition, two cellbound antimicrobial compounds, of low molecular weight, {{produced by}} <b>L.</b> lactis <b>ID</b> 1. 5 were purified and partially characterized. After purification by cationic exchange, solid phase C 18 column and three runs of reversed-phase chromatography, antimicrobial activity was recovered with 60 % and 100 % 2 -propanol, suggesting that more than one antimicrobial compound, called in this study AI and AII, were produced by <b>L.</b> lactis <b>ID</b> 1. 5. Compond AI has a spectrum of antimicrobial activity mainly against L. lactis, including its producer strain. L. lactis LMGT 2122, Bacillus subtilis DSMZ 347, Listeria innocua BL 86 / 26 B, Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR 4 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa seem to be the organisms most sensitive to compound AII. The antimicrobial activity of both compounds was drastically reduced by treatment with tween 80, but it was present after heat and proteases treatments. These compounds show distinct properties from other antimicrobial substances produced by L. lactis, and have a significant inhibitory effect against clinically important respiratory pathogens. Neste trabalho, as bacteriocinas produzidas por culturas de Lactococcus lactis isoladas de salame fermentado naturalmente no Brasil foram purificadas e identificadas. O sequenciamento dos produtos amplificados por PCR comfirmou que os genes estruturais das bacteriocinas em todas as culturas de L. lactis são idênticos ao do lantibiótico nisin Z. Plasmídeos foram detectados em todas as culturas de L. lactis e foi observado que culturas curadas foram capazes de produzir bacteriocinas, indicando que os genes relacionados à produção da bacteriocina estão localizados no cromossomo. As bacteriocinas foram purificadas utilizando precipitação das proteínas com sulfato de amônio, cromatografias de troca iônica e de fase reversa, e suas massas moleculares foram confirmadas por MALDI-TOF-TOF. A produção da bacteriocina foi investigada sob diferentes condições de crescimento. Em todas as culturas, a produção de bacteriocina foi paralela ao crescimento celular e alcançou atividade máxima na fase estacionária. Todas as culturas apresentaram produção máxima de bacteriocinas em valores de pH 6. 0 e 6. 5, em condições de aerobiose e em temperaturas de 25 °C e 30 °C, em meio LAPTg. Triptona e peptona de caseína foram as melhores fontes de nitrogênio para produção das bacteriocinas em todas as culturas. A fonte de carbono foi um dos principais fatores que influenciou a produção de nisin Z. Sacarose foi a fonte de carbono mais eficiente na produção de bacteriocinas pelas culturas de <b>L.</b> lactis <b>ID</b> 1. 5, ID 8. 5, PR 3. 1 e PD 4. 7, enquanto a frutose foi a fonte de carbono mais eficiente para <b>L.</b> lactis <b>ID</b> 3. 1. As culturas apresentaram valores de atividades de bacteriocina diferentes, sendo as máximas atividades observadas nas culturas de <b>L.</b> lactis <b>ID</b> 1. 5 e ID 8. 5. As sequências dos promotores nisZ e nisF obtidas de todas as culturas foram idênticas entre si, contudo outros fatores podem estar envolvidos nas diferenças da produção das bacteriocinas entre as culturas. Além disso, dois compostos antimicrobianos, de baixo peso molecular, produzidos por <b>L.</b> lactis <b>ID</b> 1. 5, denominados neste estudo AI e AII, foram purificados e parcialmente caracterizados.

30|$|Expansion of {{the size}} of the {{environment}} increases both the number of repeated and unique ID encoding emitters required by our proposed system. However, the number of repeated <b>IDs</b> <b>L</b> is not changed. Only N_ 1 changes when the size of the environment is altered. Figure 1 shows that we use nine (<b>L)</b> repeated <b>IDs</b> and they are introduced to the ceiling with W lines in the X-direction and H lines in the Y-direction. The unique IDs are introduced between the repeated IDs as shown in Fig. 1. Then, (W- 1) by (H- 1) unique ID encoding IR emitters are needed. This indicates that the number of IDs required for our proposed method is N_ 1 + L = (W- 1) * (H- 1) + 9. If only unique IDs were used, the required number of IDs would have been N_ 2 = (W- 1) * (H- 1) + W * H. For instance, let W = 100 and H = 80, in which case N_ 1 + L = 7830 and N_ 2 = 15, 821. Thus, the value of N_ 2 is more than twice that of N_ 1 + L. The utilization of a repeated ID encoding emitter reduces the increase in memory size. Furthermore, this superiority of our method is more obvious in a large environment.|$|R

40|$|Summary. The short-period seismic phase Sn {{has been}} {{interpreted}} by Stephens & Isacks as a <b>l</b> <b>id</b> wave ' in which the seismic energy is constrained to the uppermost few tens of kilometres of the mantle. We have extended their normal-mode interpretation for structures both with and without low-velocity zones (LVZ) in the upper mantle. We have used spherical, anelastic models of the Earth. For a model of an oceanic mantle with a LVZ, we agree that Sn is a lid wave for sources above 200 - 250 km, if only the onset of Sn is considered. The later portions of the Sn wave train sample the structure as deeply as the 420 -km discontinuity. For deeper foci, the pseudo-lid wave {{does not appear to}} be generated; even the onset of Sn samples the deeper mantle structure. For a model of a continental mantle without a LVZ, in general, sources at all depths above the 420 -km discontinuity appear to generate teleseismic Sn which samples the entire mantle as deeply as the discontinuity and which travels with a velocity significantly greater than the lid velocity. Thus the velocity of Sn may be an important diagnostic to determine whether or not a LVZ exists in the upper mantle. ...|$|E

AbstmctmMimicking the case of rigid robot arms, the set-point regulation problem for manipulators with flexible links moving under gravity can be solved by either model-based compensation or <b>l</b> <b>iD</b> control. The former cannot be applied if an unknown payload is present or when model parameters are poorly estimated, while the latter requires fine and lengthy tuning of gains {{in order to achieve}} good performance on the whole workspace. Moreover, no global convergence proof has been yet given for PID control of flexible robot arms. In this paper, a simple iterative scheme is proposed for generating exact gravity compensa-tion at the desired set-point, without the knowledge of rigid or flexible dynamic model terms. The control aw starts with a PD action on the error at the joint level, updating at discrete instants an additional feedforward term. Global convergence of the scheme is proved under a mild condition on the proportional gain and a structural property on the arm stiffness, which is usually satisfied in practice. The proposed learning scheme is also extended to the direct control of the end-effector (tip) position. Experimental results are pre-sented for a two-link robot with a flexible forearm moving on a tilted plane. 1...|$|E
