5|$|After 5:00 pm, Custer's {{division}} (including Capehart's brigade) remounted, {{and attacked}} a Confederate battery. The battery {{was unable to}} shoot <b>low</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> hit the charging cavalry, and was soon captured. The rebels responded with a Rebel yell, and soon the opposing forces were fighting in close combat using sabers. Because of their position on the field, most of the Union casualties in this encounter belonged to the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry—but {{a large portion of}} the loss was from wounds that were not lethal.|$|E
5|$|In HIT, the {{platelet}} {{count in the}} blood falls below the normal range, a condition called thrombocytopenia. However, it is generally not <b>low</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> lead to {{an increased risk of}} bleeding. Most people with HIT will therefore not experience any symptoms. Typically the {{platelet count}} will fall 5–14 days after heparin is first given; if someone has received heparin in the previous three months, the fall in platelet count may occur sooner, sometimes within a day.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{bacteria}} form close spatial {{associations that}} are essential for their survival. One such mutualistic association, called interspecies hydrogen transfer, occurs between clusters of anaerobic bacteria that consume organic acids, such as butyric acid or propionic acid, and produce hydrogen, and methanogenic Archaea that consume hydrogen. The bacteria in this association are unable to consume the organic acids as this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates in their surroundings. Only the intimate association with the hydrogen-consuming Archaea keeps the hydrogen concentration <b>low</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> allow the bacteria to grow.|$|E
5|$|PDISs are {{intermediate}} {{stops at}} a depth above the depth at which the leading compartment for the decompression calculation switches from ongassing to offgassing and below {{the depth of the}} first obligatory decompression stop, (or the surface, on a no-decompression dive). The ambient pressure at that depth is <b>low</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> ensure that the tissues are mostly offgassing inert gas, although under a very small pressure gradient. This combination is expected to inhibit bubble growth. The leading compartment is generally not the fastest compartment except in very short dives, for which this model does not require an intermediate stop.|$|E
5|$|Pudús have various {{methods of}} obtaining the foliage they need. Their small stature and {{cautious}} nature create obstacles in attaining food. They stop often while searching for food {{to stand on}} their hind legs and smell the wind, detecting food scents. Females and fawns peel bark from saplings using their teeth, but mature males may use their spikelike antlers. The deer may use their front legs to press down on saplings until they snap or become <b>low</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> the ground so they can reach the leaves. Forced to stand on their hind legs due to their small size, the deer climb branches and tree stumps to reach higher foliage. They bend bamboo shoots horizontally in order to walk on them and eat from higher branches.|$|E

5|$|The skyway was a {{constraint}} in {{the building}} of the New Jersey Turnpike in 1951. The turnpike had to be built <b>low</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> provide enough clearance underneath the skyway, but high enough to then provide sufficient clearance over the nearby Passaic River. Turnpike engineers could have built over the skyway (at a much higher cost) or under the skyway's trusses; the latter option was chosen. As part of a 2005 seismic retrofit project, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority lowered the Passaic River Viaduct Bridge on its easterly alignment to increase vertical clearance and allow for full-width shoulders underneath the Pulaski Skyway. Engineers replaced the bearings and lowered the turnpike bridge by , without shutting it to traffic.|$|E
5|$|The {{turkey vulture}} is a {{scavenger}} and feeds {{almost exclusively on}} carrion. It finds its food using its keen eyes and sense of smell, flying <b>low</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> detect the gases produced by {{the beginnings of the}} process of decay in dead animals. In flight, it uses thermals to move through the air, flapping its wings infrequently. It roosts in large community groups. Lacking a syrinx—the vocal organ of birds—its only vocalizations are grunts or low hisses. It nests in caves, hollow trees, or thickets. Each year it generally raises two chicks, which it feeds by regurgitation. It has very few natural predators. In the United States, the vulture receives legal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.|$|E
5|$|Bismarck then shifted fire to Prince of Wales. The British {{battleship}} {{scored a}} hit on Bismarck with her sixth salvo, but the German ship found her mark with her first salvo. One of the shells struck the bridge on Prince of Wales, though it did not explode and instead exited the other side, killing everyone in the ship's command centre, save Captain John Leach, the ship's commanding officer, and one other. The two German ships continued to fire upon Prince of Wales, causing serious damage. Guns malfunctioned on the recently commissioned British ship, which still had civilian technicians aboard. Despite the technical faults in the main battery, Prince of Wales scored three hits on Bismarck in the engagement. The first struck her in the forecastle above the waterline but <b>low</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> allow the crashing waves to enter the hull. The second shell struck below the armoured belt and exploded on contact with the torpedo bulkhead completely flooding a turbo-generator room and partially flooding an adjacent boiler room. The third shell passed {{through one of the}} boats carried aboard the ship and then went through the floatplane catapult without exploding.|$|E
50|$|Unusually {{high levels}} of uranium have also been {{detected}} in the cove's bottom sediment, likely owing to the activities of a nuclear technology company which was previously residing in the area; however, the actual levels of radioactivity are considered <b>low</b> <b>enough</b> not <b>to</b> be considered a health risk.|$|R
50|$|The {{scintillator}} must be {{shielded from}} all ambient light so that external photons do not swamp the ionization events caused by incident radiation.

5|$|From 1947, Ivatt 2-6-0 {{lightweight}} tender locomotives were {{allocated to}} Goole shed, and were soon {{operating on the}} Axholme Joint Railway. The last two Barton Wright 0-6-0 locomotives left Goole shed in December 1950 for Wakefield {{and all of the}} seven Ivatt locomotives are thought to have worked on the line. They were popular with the crews, as the tender was fitted with a back sheet for the cab, and was <b>low</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> provide good visibility when running tender-first across the moors on the return journey to Goole. In 1957 they were briefly replaced by four elderly J10 0-6-0 tender engines, transferred from Liverpool, but all were withdrawn in 1958. Small diesel shunters were allocated to Goole shed in 1960, for use in the docks, but were also used on the Axholme Joint Railway. Only one of the Ivatt 2-6-0 locomotives was left at Goole by mid-1962.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the fact}} that HIT predisposes {{strongly}} to new episodes of thrombosis, it {{is not sufficient to}} simply discontinue the heparin administration. Generally, an alternative anticoagulant is needed to suppress the thrombotic tendency while the generation of antibodies stops and the platelet count recovers. To make matters more complicated, the other most commonly used anticoagulant, warfarin, should not be used in HIT until the platelet count is at least 150 x 10^9/L because there is a very high risk of warfarin necrosis in people with HIT who have low platelet counts. Warfarin necrosis is the development of skin gangrene in those receiving warfarin or a similar vitamin K inhibitor. If the patient was receiving warfarin at the time when HIT is diagnosed, the activity of warfarin is reversed with vitamin K. Transfusing platelets is discouraged, as there is a theoretical risk that this may worsen the risk of thrombosis; the platelet count is rarely <b>low</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be the principal cause of significant hemorrhage.|$|E
5|$|Ireland is {{the third}} best seller European market of E85 flex-fuel vehicles, after Sweden and France. Bioethanol (E85) in Ireland is made from whey, a waste product of cheese manufacturing. The Irish {{government}} established several incentives, including a 50% discount in vehicle registration taxes (VRT), which can {{account for more than}} one third of the retail price of a new car in Ireland (around €6,500). The bioethanol element of the E85 fuel is excise-free for fuel companies, allowing retail prices to be <b>low</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> offset the 25 per cent cut in fuel economy that E-85 cars offer, due to ethanol's lower energy content than gasoline. Also, the value added tax (VAT) on the fuel can also be claimed back. E-85 fuel is available across the country in more than 20 of Maxol service stations. In October 2005, the 1.8 Ford Focus FFV became the first flexible-fuel vehicle to be commercially sold in Ireland. Later Ford launched the C-max and the Mondeo flexifuel models. Saab and Volvo also have E85 models available.|$|E

50|$|When {{the ship}} changes course rapidly at speed, the {{acceleration}} {{due to the}} turn can be <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> confuse the gyro and make it deviate from true vertical. In such cases, the ship's gyrocompass sends a disabling signal that closes a solenoid valve to block mercury flow between the tanks.

5|$|The Sun's {{convection}} zone {{extends from}} 0.7 solar radii (200,000km) to near the surface. In this layer, the solar plasma is not dense enough or {{hot enough to}} transfer the heat energy of the interior outward via radiation. Instead, {{the density of the}} plasma is <b>low</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> allow convective currents to develop and move the Sun's energy outward towards its surface. Material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands, thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise. As a result, an orderly motion of the mass develops into thermal cells that carry the majority of the heat outward to the Sun's photosphere above. Once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just beneath the photospheric surface, its density increases, and it sinks {{to the base of the}} convection zone, where it again picks up heat from the top of the radiative zone and the convective cycle continues. At the photosphere, the temperature has dropped to 5,700 K and the density to only 0.2 g/m3 (about 1/6,000 the density of air at sea level).|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Blanca {{originated}} from a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa into the Atlantic Ocean on June19. Traveling westward, the wave existed {{in a region}} of strong wind shear, preventing convective activity from developing. By June29, the wave had crossed Central America and moved into the eastern Pacific basin. Several days later, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring {{the system as a}} disorganized area of shower and thunderstorm activity off the southwest coast of Mexico. Early the next day, a trough of low pressure developed within the system; wind shear {{in the path of the}} storm were expected to be <b>low</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> allow tropical cyclone development. On July4, curved banding-features developed along the periphery of the wave, indicating that an area of low pressure had developed. Gradual organization took place over the follow days. Early on July6, the low had become sufficiently organized to attain tropical depression strength roughly 435miles (700kilometres) south of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, the system was not operationally declared a depression; instead, the first advisory by the NHC was issued several hours later and immediately declared the cyclone as Tropical Storm Blanca.|$|E
5|$|After lambs {{are several}} weeks old, lamb marking (ear tagging, docking, and castrating) is carried out. Vaccinations are usually {{carried out at}} this point as well. Ear tags with numbers are attached, or ear marks are applied, for ease of later {{identification}} of sheep. Castration is performed on ram lambs not intended for breeding, although some shepherds choose to omit this for ethical, economic or practical reasons. However, many would disagree with regard to timing. Docking and castration are commonly done after 24 hours (to avoid interference with maternal bonding and consumption of colostrum) and are often done not later than one week after birth, to minimize pain, stress, recovery time and complications. The first course of vaccinations (commonly anti-clostridial) is commonly given at an age of about 10 to 12 weeks; i.e. when the concentration of maternal antibodies passively acquired via colostrum {{is expected to have}} fallen <b>low</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> permit development of active immunity. Ewes are often revaccinated annually about 3 weeks before lambing, to provide high antibody concentrations in colostrum during the first several hours after lambing. Ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated. Tail docking is commonly done for welfare, having been shown to reduce risk of flystrike. Objections to all these procedures have been raised by animal rights groups, but farmers defend them by saying they solve many practical and veterinary problems, and inflict only temporary pain.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1970s, video games existed almost entirely as novelties passed around by programmers and technicians with access to computers, primarily at research institutions and large companies. The history of video games transitioned into a new era early in the decade, however, with the rise of the commercial video game industry. In 1971, Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck developed a coin-operated computer game, Galaxy Game, at Stanford University using a DEC PDP-11 computer with vector displays. The pair was inspired to make the game by Spacewar; Tuck had remarked in 1966 while playing the game that a coin-operated version of the game would be very successful. Such a device was unfeasible in 1966 due to the cost of computers, but in 1969 DEC released the PDP-11 for US$20,000; while this was still too high for a commercially viable product, as most games in arcades cost around US$1,000 at the time, the pair felt it was <b>low</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> build a prototype to determine interest and optimal per-game pricing. Only prototype units were ever built, though the second prototype was adapted to run up to eight games at once; a few months before the initial installation at Stanford in November 1971, the pair met with Nolan Bushnell, who informed them of his own game he was making for a much lower price.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Stanford University student Bill Pitts, {{who had a}} hobby of {{exploring}} the steam tunnels and buildings of the campus, broke into a building he found {{out to be the}} location of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Project, which held a DEC PDP-6 time-sharing computer system with 20 Teletype consoles connected to it. Fascinated by the computer and having taken several introductory computer classes, Pitts convinced the head of the project, Lester Earnest, to let him use the computer after hours. Soon, Pitts had ceased going to classes, instead spending his nights in the computer lab interacting with the graduate and postgraduate students and playing Spacewar on the PDP-6. Pitts often played against Hugh Tuck, a student at California Polytechnic State University who was a friend from high school. During one Spacewar session that took place, depending on the source, between 1966 and 1969, Tuck remarked that a coin-operated version of the game would be very successful. Such a device was still unfeasible due to the cost of computers, and the pair did not pursue the project. In 1971, however, Pitts, who by then had graduated and was working at Lockheed as a PDP-10 programmer, learned of the 1970 DEC PDP-11, which was sold for around US$14,000. While this was still too high for a commercially viable product, as most electronic games in arcades cost around US$1,000 at the time, Tuck and Pitts felt it was <b>low</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> build a prototype to determine interest and optimal per-game pricing.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Jeffrey Moore (planetary {{geologist}} of Ames Research Center) {{proposed an}} alternate view of Titan's geology. Noting that no volcanic features had been unambiguously identified on Titan so far, {{he asserted that}} Titan is a geologically dead world, whose surface is shaped only by impact cratering, fluvial and eolian erosion, mass wasting and other exogenic processes. According to this hypothesis, methane is not emitted by volcanoes but slowly diffuses out of Titan's cold and stiff interior. Ganesa Macula may be an eroded impact crater with a dark dune in the center. The mountainous ridges observed in some regions can be explained as heavily degraded scarps of large multi-ring impact structures or {{as a result of}} the global contraction due to the slow cooling of the interior. Even in this case, Titan may still have an internal ocean made of the eutectic water–ammonia mixture with a temperature of , which is <b>low</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be explained by the decay of radioactive elements in the core. The bright Xanadu terrain may be a degraded heavily cratered terrain similar to that observed on the surface of Callisto. Indeed, were it not for its lack of an atmosphere, Callisto could serve as a model for Titan's geology in this scenario. Jeffrey Moore even called Titan Callisto with weather.|$|E
30|$|Specific {{hardware}} {{components of}} the PET/MR system such as coils or the patient bed are usually not visible in MR images.
