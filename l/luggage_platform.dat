5000|$|... #Caption: Until {{the late}} 1950s, {{vehicles}} licensed as London taxis {{were required to}} be provided with an open-access <b>luggage</b> <b>platform</b> {{in place of the}} front passenger seat found on other passenger cars (including taxis licensed for use in other British cities).|$|E
50|$|Three {{models were}} produced, each a detail {{improvement}} of the previous. The Series I of 1947 had artillery wheels. The Series II, introduced in 1949 had pressed steel wheels and the Series III of 1950 had what was, in effect a six light body, although of course the <b>luggage</b> <b>platform</b> had no door and thus no window.|$|E
50|$|The {{station is}} on a raised viaduct {{running in a}} roughly north-south direction. There are two exits, the north exit (北口) and south exit (南口). Both exits have ticket vending {{machines}} and toilets; however, the north exit has a Midori no Madoguchi staffed ticket office and escalators to the <b>platforms.</b> <b>Luggage</b> lockers {{are available at the}} south exit.|$|R
2500|$|In 1881 {{platforms}} 4 to 6 (Platform 5 being a bay to the south) were added, being [...] {{long and}} [...] wide. The level crossing which gave access from platform 1 to platform 2 was removed and access {{provided by a}} new footbridge [...] wide with staircases down to each platform. Platforms 2 and 3 were lengthened by about [...] and new waiting rooms and refreshment rooms were provided, designed by the company architect John Holloway Sanders. A subway was installed to allow better transfer of <b>luggage</b> between <b>platforms</b> with hydraulic lifts to raise and lower luggage. The turntables were removed and replaced by scissors crossovers, the whole complex controlled by a signal box on the centre platform.|$|R

50|$|Bumpers and Magna wheels were {{standardised}} on all Austin's de luxe {{models in}} September 1932 {{and in addition}} there were all round price reductions. In August 1933 a new Ascot saloon was announced with chassis improvements and the same changes as made to the Twelve-Four range. The new Ascot had a new separate compartment for the spare tyre and its hinged panel forms a <b>luggage</b> <b>platform</b> when lowered.|$|E
50|$|Following on from {{previous}} designs of London taxi, the FX3 had a traditional 3-door body, {{with an open}} <b>luggage</b> <b>platform</b> rather than a front passenger seat beside the driver. The FX3 was fitted with mechanical brakes, with rod operation, beam axles on leaf springs and a built-in Jackall hydraulic jacking system. Like all London taxis, it has a tight turning circle of 25 ft (7.6m) diameter, {{as required by the}} Conditions of Fitness.|$|E
50|$|Changes in the Conditions of Fitness {{after the}} Second World War banned the landaulette style {{of body and}} the {{production}} vehicle was fitted with a fixed head body, of pressed steel over a wood frame. With its limousine configuration and open <b>luggage</b> <b>platform</b> beside the driver, it was in every other respect the same style as all previous London taxis. It was the last new design to be launched at the historic Ward End, Birmingham, plant which had been Wolseley's home since 1919.|$|E
5000|$|The station {{initially}} {{had just}} one platform on the landward side with a loop line closer to the sea, but a second platform was added to serve the loop line on 1 May 1858. The original wooden station and train shed was burnt down on 14 August 1873. [...] The South Devon Railway built a new station with the platforms connected by an iron bridge, roofed with glass. The principal buildings were constructed adjoining Station Road, and the booking office was fitted with pitch pine cornice and fittings. Star gas pendent lights were installed, and a lift for taking up <b>luggage</b> to the <b>platform</b> levels. The first-class waiting rooms were furnished with Brussels carpets and polished oak furniture. The contractor was Blatchford and Son of Tavistock and the cost was £4,000 (...) [...] The new station was re-opened on 12 April 1875 ...|$|R
6000|$|I could fancy the [...] "sort of thing" [...] {{they put}} on the {{presentation}} copies of their photographs, and I was sure they wrote a beautiful hand. It was odd how quickly I was sure of everything that concerned them. If they were now so poor as to have to cam shillings and pence they could never have had much of a margin. Their good looks had been their capital, and they had good-humouredly {{made the most of}} the career that this resource marked out for them. It was in their faces, the blankness, the deep intellectual repose of the twenty years of country-house visiting that had given them pleasant intonations. I could see the sunny drawing-rooms, sprinkled with periodicals she didn't read, in which Mrs. Monarch had continuously sat; I could see the wet shrubberies in which she had walked, equipped to admiration for either exercise. I could see the rich covers the Major had helped to shoot and the wonderful garments in which, late at night, he repaired to the smoking-room to talk about them. I could imagine their leggings and waterproofs, their knowing tweeds and rugs, their rolls of sticks and cases of tackle and neat umbrellas; and I could evoke the exact appearance of their servants and the compact variety of their <b>luggage</b> on the <b>platforms</b> of country stations.|$|R
6000|$|I {{have been}} trying to {{remember}} whether I fasted all the way to Macon, which I reached at an advanced hour of the evening, and think I must have done so except for the purchase of a box of nougat at Montélimart (the place is famous for the manufacture of this confection, which, at the station, is hawked at the windows of the train) and for a bouillon, very much later, at Lyons. The journey beside the Rhone--past Valence, past Tournon, past Vienne--would have been charming, on that luminous Sunday, but for two disagreeable accidents. The express from Marseilles, which I took at Orange, was full to overflowing; and the only refuge I could find was an inside angle in a carriage laden with Germans who had command of the windows, which they occupied as strongly as they have been known to occupy other strategical positions. I scarcely know, however, why I linger on this particular discomfort, for it was but a single item in a considerable list of grievances--grievances dispersed through six weeks of constant railway-travel in France. I have not touched upon them at an earlier stage of this chronicle, but my reserve is not owing to any sweetness of association. This form of locomotion, in the country of the amenities, is attended with a dozen discomforts; almost all the conditions of the business are detestable. They force the sentimental tourist again and again to ask himself whether, in consideration of such mortal annoyances, the game is worth the candle. Fortunately a railway journey is a good deal like a sea-voyage; its miseries fade from the mind as soon as you arrive. That is why I completed, to my great satisfaction, my little tour in France. Let this small effusion of ill-nature be my first and last tribute to the whole despotic gare: the deadly salle d'attente, the insufferable delays over one's <b>luggage,</b> the porterless <b>platform,</b> the overcrowded and illiberal train.

How many a time did the eager British mercenary, clad in velveteen and clinging {{to the door of the}} carriage as it glides into the station, revisit my invidious dreams! The paternal porter and the responsive hansom are among the best gifts of the English genius to the world. I hasten to add, faithful to my habit (so insufferable to some of my friends) of ever and again readjusting the balance after I have given it an honest tip, that the bouillon at Lyons, which I spoke of above, was, though by no means an idea bouillon, much better than any I could have obtained at an English railway-station.

50|$|The central train shed today {{serves as}} a {{terminal}} station with seven tracks running from the west. Originally, however, it housed only six platform tracks. Even before the Second World War another platform track was integrated into the train shed, the current platform 14. This change involved the abolition of two luggage platforms, leaving only the former <b>luggage</b> <b>platform</b> between platforms 6 and 9. The tracks of {{the central part of}} the station are approximately at street level, while all the through tracks run in a second level which is about 4.50 metres higher.|$|E
50|$|The car was {{supplied}} with an {{adjustable steering column}} and body insulation. It comfortably carried four passengers with room for a small fifth passenger in {{the centre of the}} back seat. Even the quarter-lights were {{supplied with}} blinds, there were flush fitting footrests {{in the back of the}} large, adjustable, front seats with pull straps above. The back floor was flat except for the somewhat pronounced propellor shaft tunnel. The boot was provided with a fitted suitcase, the spare wheel sitting horizontally in the space below. The door could be let down and used as a <b>luggage</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|E

I hasten to add, faithful to my habit (so insufferable to some of my friends) of ever and again readjusting the balance after I have given it an honest tip, that the bouillon at Lyons, which I spoke of above, was, though by no means an ideal bouillon, much better than any I could have obtained at an English railway station. After I had imbibed it, I sat in the train (which waited a long time at Lyons) and, by the light of one of the big lamps on the platform, read all sorts of disagreeable things in certain radical newspapers which I had bought at the book-stall. I gathered from these sheets that Lyons was in extreme commotion. The Rhone and the Saone, which form a girdle for the splendid town, were almost in the streets, as I could easily be- lieve from what I had seen of the country after leav- ing Orange. The Rhone, all the way to Lyons, had been in all sorts of places where it had no business to be, and matters were naturally not improved by its confluence with the charming and copious stream which, at Macon, is said once to have given such a happy opportunity to the egotism of the capital. A visitor from Paris (the anecdote is very old), being asked on the quay of that city whether he didn't ad- mire the Saone, replied good-naturedly that it was very pretty, but that in Paris they spelled it with the ei. This moment of general alarm at Lyons had been chosen by certain ingenious persons (I credit them, perhaps, with too sure a prevision of the rise of the rivers) for practising further upon the appre- hensions of the public. A bombshell filled with dynamite had been thrown into a cafe, and various votaries of the comparatively innocuous petit verre had been wounded (I am not sure whether any one had been killed) by the irruption. Of course there had been arrests and incarcerations, and the [...] "Intransi- geant" [...] and the [...] "Rappel" [...] were filled with the echoes of the explosion. The tone of these organs is rarely edifying, and it had never been less so than on this occasion. I wondered, as I looked through them, whether I was losing all my radicalism; and then I wondered whether, after all, I had any to lose. Even in so long await as that tiresome delay at Lyons I failed to settle the question, any more than I made up my mind as to the probable future of the militant democracy, or the ultimate form of a civilization which should have blown up everything else. A few days later, the waters went down it Lyons; but the de- mocracy has not gone down.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} was uncommonly luxurious, and of exceptional workmanship. The dashboard was aircraft-inspired, {{and one of}} the first to feature a middle console over the gearbox. The rear seats folded flat to provide a <b>luggage</b> <b>platform</b> and additional access to the boot. In 1955 the engine capacity increased to 4.8 litres and 200 hp (FV1), which later in the year grew to 250 hp (FV2). 47 of these early FVs were built in 1954 and 1955. Six were convertibles, but as these suffered from rigidity troubles the rest of the large two-door Facels were pillarless coupés.|$|E
5000|$|... "Clean-cut {{beauty in}} the modern trend". [...] "Entirely new frontal design {{including}} a longer bonnet and new-shaped radiator and rear panelling". Syncromesh on all but first gear. Flush direction indicators with automatic return. Bumpers are fitted fore and aft. The spare wire wheel and its tyre are now carried in the boot and the <b>luggage</b> <b>platform</b> on the door can be swivelled to one side. Dip and switch of the headlamps is controlled by a foot button. The Jackall four-wheel hydraulic jacks, workable from inside the car, will raise all four wheels at once or {{the front and back}} ones in pairs. The brakes are of Girling type.|$|E
50|$|One {{obstacle}} to operations until then {{was that it}} was difficult to reach the terminal tracks in the eastern precinct. As a remedy, a new through track was built through the north hall between platforms 10 and 11, replacing a <b>luggage</b> <b>platform.</b> This would henceforth be used for the passage of additional trains to the eastern precinct and for the passage of unattached locomotives and freight traffic. To take advantage of the sharp rise in through passenger traffic, the covered side hall next to the south hall was demolished, so that the two freight train tracks could be moved on to an outer track on a new concrete structure over the pavement and the released space could be used for an island platform.|$|E
50|$|The {{motoring}} correspondent of The Times {{published his}} {{experiences with the}} smaller engined sports saloon car in August 1937 soon after its announcement. The handsome body he said offers room for five and really comfortable seating. A driver can climb {{in and out of}} the car by the near side without too much difficulty. The luggage compartment contained toolboxes which might have been better stowed below at each side of the spare wheel to avoid being obliged to use the door of the boot as a <b>luggage</b> <b>platform.</b> It is delightful to handle, the full-synchromesh gearbox was everything it should be. The steering on the extra-low-pressure tyres was a shade heavy, brakes were powerful. The car's front was always firm and there was no needless pitch and toss.|$|E
5000|$|The FX4 London taxi was the {{successor}} to the Austin FX3, which was produced between 1948 and 1958. In its day the FX3 was {{the most widely used}} taxi in London. Like the FX3, the FX4 was designed by Austin in collaboration with Mann & Overton, the London taxi dealership that commissioned it (and paid for half of its cost) and Carbodies, the coachbuilder that built the body and assembled the cab ready for sale. The design team included Albert Moore from Austin’s engineering division, Jack Hellberg from Carbodies and David Southwell of Mann & Overton. [...] The original design was by Austin’s Eric Bailey and it was engineered for production by Carbodies' Jake Donaldson. It would be the first London taxi to go into production that had four doors, since earlier London taxis had featured a <b>luggage</b> <b>platform,</b> open to the elements, on the pavement/sidewalk side {{at the front of the}} cabin, beside the driver's compartment.|$|E
5000|$|The first 508A, {{introduced}} in 1932, was a 2-door [...] "Berlina" [...] (saloon/sedan) with four seats and a three speed [...] "crash" [...] gearbox. The front seats could be slid forwards and the backrests tilted {{in order to}} facilitate access to the back seat in what was a relatively small car. Unusually, the windows in the doors could be wound down by turning a crank handle fitted to the door, while the windscreen was hinged at the top and could be opened, while two windscreen wipers were powered by their own electric motor, positioned inside just above the windscreen. The interior used rubber mats while the seats were cloth covered. Accessories offered included a dash-mounted rear-view mirror, an interior light mounted on the centre of the roof and an externally mounted <b>luggage</b> <b>platform</b> at the back which, when specified, came with the spare wheel repositioned to a mounting point {{on the side of the}} car between the left-side door and the front wing. A [...] "Lusso" [...] ("de Luxe") version also featured a better type of cloth covering for the seats as well as extra bright work around the lights, front grille, wheels and door handles.|$|E
