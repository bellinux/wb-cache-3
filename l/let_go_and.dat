5|$|The storm made {{launching}} the lifeboats almost impossible. At about 3:00am, Captain Pearce ordered the two port lifeboats lowered, each with four crew on board. While being passed astern {{one of the}} boats broke the painter and became adrift. Her crew tried hard to {{pull up to the}} ship's side, but it was impossible in the heavy squall. The other was accidentally <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> both boats, in heavy seas, were unable to be retrieved.|$|E
5|$|The {{fifth and}} final bout {{of the main}} card was the UFC Welterweight Championship match between Georges St-Pierre and B.J. Penn, {{regulated}} by referee Herb Dean. The bout started out with the two fighters clinching and throwing knees. St-Pierre dropped down for a single-leg takedown but Penn defended while standing on one leg {{with his back to}} the cage. Unable to get the takedown, St-Pierre <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> connected with a right hand punch. They met up and clinched in the middle of the cage with St-Pierre pushing Penn towards the fence. There, St-Pierre attempted a takedown but went back the clinch when he was unable to finish it. The two fighters continued trading punches to end the first round.|$|E

25|$|The folk {{religious}} practices offer {{a very different}} aspect of life from the Buddhist practices. Burmese folk faith consists of {{many different kinds of}} festivals that all involve singing and dancing, drinking and merriment, or nat-pwes. These festivals are a way for people to <b>let</b> <b>go,</b> <b>and</b> enjoy themselves. This idea of relieving stress and indulging in various pleasures {{is very different from the}} traditional doctrine of Buddhism, which emphasises losing all desires. This can often be done by fasting or through deep meditation in a quiet temple. These traditional Buddhist practices offer a starkly different way of achieving religious consciousness.|$|E

25|$|Abosso had 12 lifeboats. The even-numbered {{boats were}} on her port side {{and it is}} not clear whether any of them was launched. The odd-numbered boats were on her {{starboard}} side. As No. 3 boat was being lowered, one of its falls was <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> all of the boat's occupants were thrown into the water. No. 3 boat seems to have been carrying most of the Dutch submariners. No. 5 boat was launched successfully and managed to rescue four of the Dutch from the water. No. 9 boat was also launched successfully. It was a motor boat and moved around picking up survivors from the water.|$|E
25|$|Meggs {{explained}} the team {{knew there were}} problems with the Windows version of the game that needed addressing, but, {{as they had been}} fired, they were unable to do so.

25|$|Despite {{a mediocre}} {{record in the}} league, Baumgart' contact was {{extended}} another year until June 2010. Promotion was still the target for Baumgart's team, but after the winterbreak {{the distance to the}} promotion spot had increased so much that the board decided to let Baumgart go. Carsten Müller was appointed as an interim manager with the goal of at least winning the Landespokal, but even that failed. For the following season, Magdeburg signed Ruud Kaiser as manager, tasked with building a team capable of winning the league within two years. However, after a string of bad results brought the side dangerously close to relegation, Kaiser was <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> succeeded by Wolfgang Sandhowe.|$|E

25|$|Snella's {{first season}} back, Saint-Étienne won its second league title and, three seasons later, {{captured}} its third. Snella's {{third and final}} title with the club coincided {{with the arrival of}} Georges Bereta, Bernard Bosquier, Gérard Farison and Hervé Revelli to the team. After the season, Snella returned to Servette and former Stade de Reims manager Albert Batteux replaced him. In Batteux's first season in 1967–68, Saint-Étienne captured the double after winning the league and the Coupe de France. In the next season, Batteux won the league and, in the ensuing season, won the double again. The club's fast rise into French football led to a high-level of confidence from the club's ownership and supporters and, following two seasons without a trophy, Batteux was <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> replaced by former Saint-Étienne player Robert Herbin.|$|E
25|$|In the off-season, the Flyers {{went looking}} for a new goaltender. Burke was <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> Hextall was about to enter his final season as a backup. They chose to sign former Panther John Vanbiesbrouck over former Oiler Curtis Joseph, who ended up signing with Toronto. The 1998–99 season was marred by a {{life-threatening}} injury sustained by Eric Lindros on April Fools' Day during a game against the Nashville Predators, a season-ending injury later diagnosed as a collapsed lung. Up until that point, Lindros was having an MVP-type season with 40 goals and 53 assists in 71 games. Without Lindros, the Flyers had trouble scoring in the playoffs even after having re-acquired Mark Recchi at the trade deadline. Although Vanbiesbrouck allowed nine goals to Joseph's eleven allowed, the Flyers lost their first round series with Toronto in six games.|$|E

After the crops are destroyed by blackbirds, Pa sells a calf to earn the balance of the money needed. When Ma and Pa escort Mary to the college, Laura, Carrie, and Grace are left alone for a week. In order to stave off the loneliness stemming from Mary's departure, Laura, Carrie, and Grace do the fall cleaning. They have several problems, but the house is sparkling when they are done. Ma and Pa come home, and are truly surprised.|$|E

25|$|A Tyrannosaurus threatens Ann, but Kong kills {{it after}} a colossal battle by {{breaking}} its neck and jaw. Driscoll continues to shadow Kong and Ann while Denham returns to the village for more men. Upon arriving in Kong's lair in a mountain cave, Ann is menaced by a snake-like Elasmosaurus, which Kong wrestles and kills. While Kong is distracted killing a Pteranodon that tried to fly away with Ann, Driscoll reaches her and they climb down a vine dangling from a cliff ledge. When Kong notices and starts pulling them back up, they <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> fall unharmed into the water below. They run through the jungle {{and back to the}} village, where Denham, Englehorn and the surviving crewmen are waiting. Kong, following, breaks open the gate and murderously rampages through the village. On shore, Denham, now determined to bring Kong back alive, knocks him unconscious with a gas bomb.|$|E
25|$|In July 1930, the National Council of the FFF voted 128–20 {{in support}} of {{professional}}ism in French football. In 1933, Stéphanoise turned professional and {{changed its name to}} its current version. The club was inserted into the second division and became inaugural members of the league after finishing runner-up in the South Group. Saint-Étienne remained in Division 2 for four more seasons before earning promotion to Division 1 for the 1938–39 season under the leadership of the Scot William Duckworth. However, the team's debut appearance in the first division was short-lived due to the onset of World War II. Saint-Étienne returned to the first division after the war under the Austrian-born Frenchman Ignace Tax and surprised many by finishing runner-up to Lille in the first season after the war. The club failed to improve upon that finish in following seasons under Tax and, ahead of the 1950–51 season, was <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> replaced by former Saint-Étienne player Jean Snella.|$|E
25|$|One more {{test flight}} was {{conducted}} at the Island Grounds in 1914, when J. W. Madley, a water works engineer, tested an aircraft assembled by him. He flew it over the Red Hills reservoir to inspect works and shot a couple of aerial photographs of the reservoir from the aircraft. This incident kindled an interest in flying among prominent residents of the city, resulting in {{the arrival of a}} set of aviators in 1911 to display the flying machines they had brought with them to India as a marketing initiative. The aviators included Baron de Caters and Jules Tyck. On 15 February 1911, Tyck flew in a Blériot aeroplane in front of the public. The aircraft was wheeled out by eight men with Tyck seated inside the craft wearing an oilskin coat and goggles. The men held the plane till its engine revved up and then <b>let</b> <b>go,</b> <b>and</b> the craft darted forward about 20 yards before rising into the air. In the air, the craft made a straight flight only for about three-quarters of the length of the ground and descended due to poor weather. Tyck flew again the next day, this time reaching a height of 2,400feet, which was witnessed by the then Governor of Madras Sir Arthur Lawley. Two days later, on 18 February, another demonstration was given by Baron de Caters, when he flew his aircraft in public.|$|E
