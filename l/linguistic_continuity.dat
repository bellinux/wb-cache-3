40|$|While {{theoretical}} perspectives informing current {{studies of}} sixteenth-century literature often approach subjectivity as an exclusively cultural construction [...] pressing {{from the outside}} in, rather than processing from the inside outward [...] examination of Hamlet 2 ̆ 7 s linguistically restorative activity suggests that Shakespeare reconstructs such 2 ̆ 2 subjectivity 2 ̆ 2 within a memorially based definition of identity. Investigation of less 2 ̆ 2 mainstream, 2 ̆ 2 yet equally legitimate, sociohistorical contexts [...] including those nurturing memorial culture, medieval dramaturgy, and Tudor class struggles [...] sheds considerable light upon the sources of Hamlet 2 ̆ 7 s subjectivity, sources which resist the libidinous (in the Augustinian sense) discursive contamination of Elsinore {{at the same time}} that they encourage the proactive application of an empowering caritas. When salient thematic elements in Hamlet are measured against the arresting semantic complexity of Remigio Nannini 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of analogous events in Orationi in Materia Civile (1561), not only do the interpolations of the Venetian friar provide an illuminating framework for more thoroughly grasping the subversive intent of Hamlet 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 mad 2 ̆ 2 strategies, but they facilitate keener insight both into the Prince 2 ̆ 7 s highly integrative, meta-cognitive deployment of numerous 2 ̆ 2 sources 2 ̆ 2 within his own rich memorial structure, and into Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s realignment of the dynamics of power within the frame of <b>linguistic</b> <b>continuities.</b> Recursive in its movements, the Prince 2 ̆ 7 s pattern of re-textualizing engenders an especial form of prudentia, rooted in Hamlet 2 ̆ 7 s limber reformulations of culturally conflicting gauges of subjectivity, and dependent upon Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s appropriation of contemporary intersecting discourse communities. Exploring less restrictive modes of theorizing language and of conceptualizing power, this study traces Hamlet 2 ̆ 7 s discursively subversive challenge to the protean abuses of court rhetoric, most consistently embodied in the Prince 2 ̆ 7 s repudiation of expedient 2 ̆ 2 fashioning 2 ̆ 2 in favor of the articulation of moral uncommon-places, singular florilegia he crafts as coordinates for his relationally evolving conscience. Ultimately, this study contends, the creator of Hamlet is a revisionist humanist who, given the choices granted within the shaping context of human 2 ̆ 2 fictiveness, 2 ̆ 2 underscores, in Hamlet, connections to the world, and to one another, that, in their textual insistence upon the 2 ̆ 2 shadowings 2 ̆ 2 of similarities and differences, might very well compel current audiences to look again and hard at their own rhetorics of origins and subjectivity. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the bilingualism of nine families of Pakistani origin living in England, {{to gain an}} understanding of their experience of living through a period of rapid intergenerational language change. The families are all linked to the medical profession and the second generation are educationally successful. The study aims to gain insights into the social and linguistic processes of language shift. It also aims to contribute to understanding of the position of successful ethnic minority young people. Qualitative research methods are used, including interviews and participant observation and analysis of data is interpretive. A corpus of language use is analysed, focusing on intergenerational interaction and code-switching. Discussion of educational issues draws on policy documents. The fIrst three chapters constitute the preliminary section of the thesis. They present the research group, the social, linguistic and educational contexts, a theoretical framework and a critical description of the methodological evolution of the study. Chapters four to nine are data-based and focus on different aspects of the families' bilingualism. Accounts of early language nurture are analysed; bilingual skills and repertoires are investigated and the relationship between <b>linguistic</b> and cultural <b>continuity</b> is explored. A study of in-family bilingual interaction is presented and language education policy and its relevance to family concerns is considered. The study draws coherence from recurring themes, and insights into the experience of transitional bilingualism. Concern for educational success emerges strongly. The different signifIcance of using the minority languages inside the family and outside is revealed and the importance of long-term developments and cultural continuity is clear. Language education policies do not always reflect the priorities of the families. The linguistic situation of the families is very unstable but individuals may well take up very different intellectual positions in relation to their linguistic future...|$|R

40|$|The current {{political}} and social environment and the more ominous events unfolding across aboriginal Indigenous homelands—locally, nationally and globally—is what the Hopi people refer to as koyanisqatsi, life out of balance and which has been recounted as recurrent {{in the history of}} the human experience. It is a prominent theme in their Emergence story transported across time by each succeeding generation of Hopi through the oral tradition. The Hopi number just over 14, 000 of which half maintain a permanent residence on part of their aboriginal homelands in northeastern Arizona and continue to carry out the cultural traditions of their ancestors. Thus the words of dedication, “For the Hopi people who have maintained a firm belief in and adherence to the Hopi way of life in order that succeeding generations of Hopi will remain a distinct people,” (Author 1, 2008, p. 5) represent and represents the Hopi way of life as the resilient and reliable guiding source toward an unknown future. The paramount challenge is for the Hopi people to maintain community cohesiveness and unity, a moral existence in the natural world, and spiritual fulfillment on behalf of all people, all living things—the commitment made with Maasaw, Guardian Spirit of the Hopi Fourth World at the time of Emergence—within the context of a life out of balance. Nevertheless, our individual and collective responses are premised in our sense of accountability to our Creator as stewards of Mother Earth, and responsibility to the next generation to ensure cultural and <b>linguistic</b> survival and <b>continuity</b> (Author 2, 2016). “Very little has been written about how contemporary Native people have come into our Indigenous selves through the work we do. This is particularly true of Indigenous educators” (Cajete, 2015, p. 1). In this paper, we share and situate our “stories”—our personal and professional trajectories in two foundational Hopi concepts: itaaqatsimkiwa—our lifeline; itaatumakmakiwa—our lifework, concepts that are understood as “preordained” and “predestined” in leading each of us toward finding our “true vocation” to (p. 1). We engage in an analysis of our experiences as a manifestation of self-empowerment and voice (Ruiz, 1991). It is “the work that we do” which brought us together and nurtures our commitment to attending to our heritage language and culture.

Yet, this paper argues that Dash acknowledges Gullah's African continuities without perpetuating ideological assumptions about authenticity and temporal development. Dash creates characters from divergent cultural and linguistic backgrounds, who speak different levels of dialect and demonstrate a range of stylistic variation within the Gullah language. In doing so, the film rejects simple conceptions of African continuity and authenticity in favour of theories of linguistic and cultural convergence, componentiality, and flexibility...|$|E
40|$|This study explores {{historical}} and linguistic aspects of Rabelais’ invented catalog for the Library of the Abbey of St. Victor. Contrasting the fictional catalog with an actual catalog of St. Victor’s, it examines why this Abbey {{was such an}} apt target, and shows ways in which Rabelais’ catalog explodes concerted efforts by influential scholastics associated with St. Victor’s to corral knowledge into classified schemes. It further offers a linguistic analysis of Rabelais’ mocking of the convention of titling, whose importance had surged {{with the arrival of}} mechanized printing. All of these considerations are viewed {{in the light of the}} chapter’s structure, and the metaphor of the codpiece, where representations – the Abbey of St. Victor, for example, or any title – may or may not accurately portray what purports to be represented. The linguistic analysis, showing the interdependence of title and titled, and leading back to Rabelais’ affinity for ideas found in Plato’s Cratylus, suggests that Rabelais, holding a view of a slippery <b>linguistic</b> <b>continuity</b> between inner and outer, had found in the convention of titling, not only a ripe target for resounding satire, but a means to convey a profound insight into the nature of language.

40|$|According to the {{semantic}} approach, meaning {{resides in the}} structure of linguistic forms. In the view from pragmatics, meaning derives from context. If one were to conceive of language as a beam of light, a study of semantic meaning would involve an examination of the particles or waves of which the beam consists. Meaning would be internal to the beam. However, much can be learned about the light from studying its projection onto a screen, that is, by considering its context. In this paper I will explore the assumptions underlying these two approaches in linguistics, and then discuss previous research on the relationship between language and cultural context in the case of Jewish English spoken by New York Jews. Then, in an attempt to both extend the sociolinguistic paradigm, and further illustrate the limits of formal linguistics, I turn to Jewish children's literature to see whether the findings of previous research are borne out in written language. Written language is treated as a layer that is removed from culture. The distinction made between spoken and written language is informed by the philosophical assumptions underlying traditional approaches to language. Further, the forms of Jewish English may be traced to the influence of Yiddish. Within a framework which considers the relation of form to social meaning, <b>linguistic</b> <b>continuity</b> between Yiddish and English reflects a cultural continuity. I will explore the possibility of a broader cultural continuity, first by discussing the social significance of Hebrew, and finally by discussing Jewish values more generally. Thus, this research will broaden the scope of what is meant by language by focusing on the pragmatic aspects of Jewish language...|$|E
40|$|The Old English place-name element *funta {{derives from}} Late Latin fontāna, “spring”, and is found today in 21 place-names in England. It {{is one of}} a small group of such Latin-derived elements, which testify to a strand of <b>linguistic</b> <b>continuity</b> between Roman Britain and early Anglo-Saxon England. *funta has never {{previously}} been the subject of this type of detailed study. The continued use of the element indicates that it had a special significance in the interaction, during the fifth and sixth centuries, between speakers of British Latin and speakers of Old English, and this study sets out to assess this significance by examining the composition of each name and the area around each *funta site. Any combined element is always Old English. The distribution of the element is in the central part of the south-east lowland region of England. It does not occur in East Anglia, East Kent, west of Warwickshire or mid-Wiltshire or north of Peterborough. Seven of the places whose names contain the element occur singly, the remaining fourteen appearing to lie in groups. The areas where *funta names occur may also have other pre-English names close by. All have evidence of rural agricultural or industrial activity in late Roman times, and were accessible overland. Some have cemetery or settlement evidence of early Anglo-Saxon presence. Twelve *funta names are mentioned in Domesday. Evidence from place-names, charters and archaeological excavation shows that *funta sites usually lay between or within areas of continued British, and early Anglo-Saxon, presence. This accumulated evidence suggests that a place whose name contains the element *funta may have been a meeting-place at a spring of indigenous and incoming people in this period, probably to agree separate or, more rarely joint, territory. Thus the significance of the element may relate to a local early boundary agreement. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

The role of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese, as well as the role of the Greek American volunteer associations, and the role of the Greek Ministry of Education in relation to the operation of the Greek school were also examined. ^ The findings of the study indicated that adult participants believed the Greek language school to be the basic transmitter of the Greek language and culture to the younger generation of Greek Americans. The continuous use of the Greek language in the liturgy was found to be very important to <b>linguistic</b> <b>continuity.</b> ^ It is recommended that the Greek language schools, utilize new methods of second language teaching, as well as available computer technology. To continue to be successful, all interested organizations should unite their resources and produce relatively uniform guidelines for the operation of all the afternoon Greek language schools. ...|$|E
40|$|Histories give little {{attention}} to language dominance in school and community [...] {{to the fact that}} the past one-hundred years of 2 ̆ 2 One People, One Language, One School 2 ̆ 2 attitudes, policies, and goals in Anglo-American schools and communities have brought with them the demise of Native-American languages, the disappearance of linguistic differences due to immigrant origin, the disvalue or stereotype of linguistic patterns derived from regional and ethnic variation, and the insistence on English as a mark of linguistic and intellectual virtue. Telling Stories (0 ut of School) of Mother Tongue, God 2 ̆ 7 s Tongue, and the Queen 2 ̆ 7 s Tongue: An Ethnography in Canada gives attention to one such history. Told in Mennonite perspective and framed in Manitoba schools between 1890 and 1990, Telling Stories (Out of School) begins with tales of English-speaking Canadian insistence on and German-speaking Mennonite resistance to English-only language education policies in public and private schools serving a Mennonite speech community in southern Manitoba. The research problem links itself historically to a series of language education acts passed by the Manitoba Legislature, adjudicated by the Manitoba Attorney General, the Canadian Supreme Court, and the British Privy Council, and enforced by the Manitoba Department of Education [...] all between 1890 and 1920. These English-only policies, deemed an expedient response to the question of how to unify English Canadians, French-Canadians, Aboriginals, and immigrants, abrogated the language education rights of all linguistic minorities. English prevailed in Manitoba schools until the 1960 s. After the mid- 1960 s, though, the Canadian Parliament in concert with the Manitoba Legislature, the Manitoba Department of Education, and local public school districts re-affirmed Canada 2 ̆ 7 s English-French legacy as well as its multilingual, multicultural heritage with yet another series of language and language education acts [...] the Canadian Official Languages Act of 1969, the Canadian Constitution Act of 1982, and the Canadian Multicultural Act of 1988. Today, the Canadian 2 ̆ 2 Cultural Mosaic, 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 Multiculturalism within a Bilingual Framework, 2 ̆ 2 dispels the 2 ̆ 2 Melting Pot 2 ̆ 2 myth borrowed from the United States at the turn of the century. And, the 1990 right to 2 ̆ 2 language education choice 2 ̆ 2 in Manitoba 2 ̆ 7 s system of public schools denies the 1890 rule of 2 ̆ 2 One People, One Language, One School. 2 ̆ 2 To trace historical and recent developments in a Mennonite speech community associated with these policies, and subsequently with the contact of English, High German, and Low German” outside the classroom, 2 ̆ 2 the ethnographer [...] an insider-outsider [...] synthesizes the Hymes-type work in ethnographies of speaking and the Milroy-type work in language and social networks to examine the Ferguson-coined phenomenon of diglossia and the Fishman-extended relationship between societal diglossia and individual Bilingualism. Interviews with fifty-seven speakers, treated as a sequence of ethno-acts and ethno-events, are guided by the general question of sociolinguistic research [...] who uses what language with whom, when, where, and why? Using Hymes mnemonic code of SPEAKING leads to the description of a shared history and a shared way of speaking as well as to insights into <b>linguistic</b> <b>continuity,</b> change, and compartmentalization. Telling Stories (Out of School) ends; with tales of an ethnic revival in Mennonite schools and community today [...] with new voices speaking Low German High German, and English. While the present ethnography of a Mennonite speech community in Canada, framed in Manitoba schools between 1890 and 1990, should be regarded as impressionistic and preliminary, the fact remains [...] language dominance does do something to the life of language in a community as does language education policy that attempts to 2 ̆ 2 start where the child is [...] . linguisticallly. 2 ̆...|$|E
