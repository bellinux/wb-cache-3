5|$|In November 1887, Tchaikovsky {{arrived in}} Saint Petersburg {{in time to}} hear several of the Russian Symphony Concerts. One of them {{included}} the first complete performance of his First Symphony, subtitled Winter Daydreams, in its final version. Another concert featured the premiere of Rimsky-Korsakov's Third Symphony in its revised version. Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky corresponded considerably before the visit and spent a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>together,</b> along with Glazunov and Lyadov. Though Tchaikovsky had been a regular visitor to the Rimsky-Korsakov home since 1876, and had at one point offered to arrange Rimsky-Korsakov's appointment {{as director of the}} Moscow Conservatory, this was the beginning of closer relations between the two. Within a couple of years, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote, Tchaikovsky's visits became more frequent.|$|E

2500|$|Twin telepathy is {{a belief}} that has been {{described}} as a myth in psychological literature. Psychologists Stephen Hupp and Jeremy Jewell have noted that all experiments on the subject have failed to provide any scientific evidence for telepathy between twins. According to Hupp and Jewell there are various behavioral and genetic factors that contribute to the twin telepathy myth [...] "identical twins typically spend a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>together</b> and are usually exposed to very similar environments. Thus, it's not at all surprising that they act in similar ways and are adept at anticipating and forecasting each other's reactions to events." ...|$|E

I just buried myself in the last 500 meters. I {{knew it was going to}} hurt, but it hurts for everyone.

Eventually Neil McLellan pointed out that we'd been in the studio for four months without having anything to show for it. [...] Nat [...] was doing her own record so we weren't spending a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>together</b> , but [...] there were always dogs to stroke and videos to watch and gardens to walk 'round, so I didn't ever feel like I was at work—I was too laid-back. [...] Neil [...] said we had to get out, get back to London. I knew I physically couldn't sit in my room any more, and for the first time in my life I listened to someone else and realised I actually needed help. It wasn't [...] that I needed help with the writing, just that I needed help finding the right headspace to get into the right frame of mind. I wanted to write a good album— one I was happy with—but to do that I knew I'd have to jerk myself out of [...] situation I was in and start again.|$|E

2500|$|As {{customary}} in royal families, Louis-Charles was {{cared for}} by multiple people. Queen Marie Antoinette appointed governesses to look after all three of her children. Louis-Charles' original governess was Yolande de Polastron, duchesse de Polignac, who left France {{on the night of}} 16–17 July 1789, at the outbreak of the Revolution, at the urging of Louis XVI. She was replaced by the marquise Louise Élisabeth de Tourzel. Additionally, the queen selected Agathe de Rambaud to be the official nurse of Louis-Charles. Alain Decaux wrote: [...] "Madame de Rambaud was officially in charge of the care of the Dauphin from the day of his birth until 10 August 1792; in other words, for seven years. During these seven years, she never left him, she cradled him, took care of him, dressed him, comforted him, and scolded him. Many times, more than Marie Antoinette, she was a true mother for him". Some have suggested that Axel von Fersen, who was romantically linked with Marie Antoinette, was the father of her son. The fact that Louis Charles was born exactly nine months after he returned to court was noted, but this theory was debunked by most scholars, who reject it, observing that the time of his conception corresponded perfectly in the time that Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette had spent a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>together.</b> Marie Antoinette, who gained massive weight because of her pregnancies, including this one (she was described as [...] "very fat" [...] by the king of Sweden), retained her charisma with an imposing figure in her court, where she had lot of admirers, but she remained a faithful, strong-willed wife and a stern but loving mother.|$|E

5000|$|Zanardi {{is usually}} {{accompanied}} in his doings and wrongdoings by two schoolmates, Colasanti (full name: Roberto Colasanti) and Petrilli (full name: Sergio Petrilli, {{often in the}} endearing form Sergino, or [...] "Little Sergio"), with which he has established a sort of Clockwork Orange partnership, and who provide help, counterpoint and occasional comic relief to Zanardi's archetypal amorality. It is worthy of notice that the three almost never address each other by name in conversation, resorting either to surnames (which automatically entails a sort of detachment in Italian) or to distortions of them, thus Zanardi becomes Zanna (fang); Colasanti becomes Colas; Petrilli becomes Pietra (literally stone or rock as a possible pun on drugs). It is also worthy of notice that although the three are almost always featured as spending a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> their <b>time</b> <b>together</b> hanging out, they do not consider themselves as friends.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Spatio-temporal data {{collected}} from GPS have become an important resource to study the relationships of moving objects. While previous studies focus on mining objects being together for a long time, discovering real-world relationships, such as friends or colleagues in human trajectory data, is a fundamentally different challenge. For example, {{it is possible that}} two individuals are friends but do not spend a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> being <b>together</b> every day. However, spending just one or two hours together at a location away from work on a Saturday night could be a strong indicator of friend relationship. Based on the above observations, in this paper we aim to analyze and detectsemantically meaningful relationships inasupervisedway. Thatis, with aninterestedrelationship inmind,ausercanlabel some object pairs with and without such relationship. From labeled pairs, we will learn what time intervals are the most important ones in order to characterize this relationship. These significant time intervals, namely T-Motifs, are thenusedtodiscover relationships hiddenintheunlabeledmovingobject pairs. While the search for T-Motifs could be time-consuming, we design two speed-up strategies to efficiently extract T-Motifs. We use both real and synthetic datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. ...|$|R
