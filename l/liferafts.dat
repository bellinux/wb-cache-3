25|$|As a {{consequence}} of the accident, it was made obligatory to carry <b>liferafts</b> on all flights.|$|E
25|$|The {{deterioration}} of the Allied position in Southeast Asia promoted a general withdrawal south. On 2 March, Yarra arrived at Tjilatjap with the depot ship Anking, the tanker Francol, and the minesweeper MMS-51: the sloop was ordered to escort the other three ships to Fremantle. A day later, the ship rescued forty survivors of the Dutch ship Paragi from <b>liferafts.</b>|$|E
25|$|Whether {{the attack}} on the <b>liferafts</b> was deliberate, or an unfortunate and {{unintended}} consequence of a nighttime attack has been heavily debated. Some of the crew of U-552 survived the war, and her captain, Erich Topp, later became an Admiral in the post-war Bundesmarine. No charges were brought against Topp, as happened to Helmuth von Ruckteschell, captain of the raider Widder for a similar offence.|$|E

50|$|On 27 January 1996 at 00:32, Pacesetter was {{reported}} missing. USCG Kodiak, Alaska {{picked up an}} EPIRB Distress beacon. All Coast Guard assets were sent out to find the missing crabber. At 6:40 am a HH-60 Jayhawk helicopter sighted an epirb beacon. At 7:12 am nearby vessels spotted a <b>liferaft</b> {{with no sign of}} the crew. At 7:47 a second <b>liferaft</b> was found partially submerged and not inflated. At 8:06 a buoy float was found which had the boats name on it. After a two-day search the Coast Guard called off the search.|$|R
25|$|Kormoran was stationary, and at 18:25, Detmers {{ordered the}} ship to be abandoned, as damage to the raider's engine room had knocked out the {{fire-fighting}} systems, {{and there was no}} way to control or contain the oil fire before it reached the magazines or the mine hold. All boats and <b>liferafts</b> were launched by 21:00, and all but one filled: a skeleton crew manned the weapons while the officers prepared to scuttle the ship. Kormoran was abandoned at midnight; the ship sank slowly until the mine hold exploded 30 minutes later. The German survivors were in five boats and two rafts: one cutter carrying 46 men, two damaged steel <b>liferafts</b> with 57 and 62 aboard (the latter carrying Detmers and towing several small floats), one workboat carrying 72 people, one boat with 31 men aboard, and two rafts, each bearing 26 sailors. During the evacuation, a rubber liferaft carrying 60 people, mostly wounded, sank without warning; drowning all but three aboard. Total German casualties were six officers, 75 German sailors, and one Chinese laundryman.|$|E
25|$|Both ships sank quickly, and Varangberg {{had no time}} {{to launch}} her {{lifeboats}}. Avoceta sank by the stern, and her bows quickly rose to such an angle that her lifeboats could not be lowered. However, the liner had three <b>liferafts</b> mounted so as to float clear {{in the event of a}} shipwreck, and one of her radio officers survived by clinging to a large piece of her cork cargo that had floated free from one of her holds.|$|E
25|$|On 22 June 1940 France {{surrendered}} to Germany, and on 25 June the British Mandatory Palestine authorities barred Patria from leaving Haifa. The British authorities seized Patria on 15 August and placed her under {{the management of}} the British-India Steam Navigation Co. She was assigned to be a troop ship, authorised to carry 1,800 troops (excluding the crew). She still had only enough lifeboats for the original 805 passengers and crew, so these were supplemented with <b>liferafts.</b>|$|E
40|$|Workloads that {{comb through}} {{vast amounts of}} data are gaining {{importance}} in the sciences. These workloads consist of "needle in a haystack" queries that are long running and data intensive so that query throughput limits performance. To maximize throughput for data-intensive queries, we put forth LifeRaft: a query processing system that batches queries with overlapping data requirements. Rather than scheduling queries in arrival order, <b>LifeRaft</b> executes queries concurrently against an ordering of the data that maximizes data sharing among queries. This decreases I/O and increases cache utility. However, such batch processing can increase query response time by starving interactive workloads. <b>LifeRaft</b> addresses starvation using techniques inspired by head scheduling in disk drives. Depending upon the workload saturation and queuing times, the system adaptively and incrementally trades-off processing queries in arrival order and data-driven batch processing. Evaluating <b>LifeRaft</b> in the SkyQuery federation of astronomy databases reveals a two-fold improvement in query throughput. Comment: CIDR 200...|$|R
25|$|Two further {{survivors}} reached safety. One {{was rescued}} {{on the third}} day after the attack; the other was an Italian who drifted on a <b>liferaft</b> for a fortnight until he came ashore at Mtunzini in Natal.|$|R
2500|$|The {{casualties}} [...] "had {{an immense}} {{impact on the}} world concept of ferry safety" [...] and led to changes in safety regulations {{as well as in}} <b>liferaft</b> design, much as the Titanic disaster did in 1912.|$|R
25|$|Three {{cabin crew}} and twelve {{passengers}} {{were killed in}} the impact. Of these, four were confirmed drowned, while eleven were missing and presumed dead. Eleven passengers and the remaining six crew members were injured, while thirteen passengers reported no injuries. Thirty people survived the crash. The passengers were evenly distributed throughout the aircraft, although there was a slightly higher proportion of survivors forward than aft. The surviving three cabin crew, an off duty captain and flight attendant, evacuated the passengers onto the wings and into <b>liferafts.</b>|$|E
25|$|Empire Star {{transmitted}} a {{distress signal}} {{and the order}} was given to abandon ship. The crew launched the remaining three lifeboats and five <b>liferafts.</b> The boat were fitted with skates, which enabled the port ones to be launched despite the heavy list. Despite a heavy sea, all passengers and crew were evacuated except the four killed in the engine room. The three boats then stood off as the ship righted herself and settled low in the water. The First Officer, Leslie Vernon, considered whether to reboard the ship {{to see if she}} could be saved.|$|E
25|$|One {{lifeboat}} contained 38 {{people and}} was commanded by Captain Capon. Chief Officer Vernon commanded a second, which with difficulty {{in the heavy}} sea collected nine survivors from five <b>liferafts.</b> Mr Vernon's boat transferred the Third Officer, Roland Moscrop-Young, to command the third boat, leaving Mr Vernon's boat with 34 people. Mr Moscrop-Young's boat contained 27 people and was the least crowded boat. Mr Moscrop-Young tried to get it alongside to take some people off Captain Capon's, but was prevented by the heavy sea. Capon ordered the three boats to keep together overnight and then sail for the Azores, which were about 570 miles to the south.|$|E
50|$|Shipping lanes are {{the busiest}} {{parts of the}} sea, thus being a useful place for {{stranded}} boaters whose boats are sinking or people on a <b>liferaft</b> to boat to, and be rescued by a passing ship.|$|R

25|$|As Abosso {{settled in}} the water, she {{temporarily}} righted herself, her crew got her emergency generator working, and her floodlights were switched on to help the evacuation. Almost immediately after this, U-575 fired a torpedo {{from one of her}} stern torpedo tubes, which hit Abosso at 22:28 (Berlin time) forward of her bridge. At 2305 hrs (Berlin time) Abosso sank bow first. The submarine then surfaced, approached the débris area, and scanned the boats with her searchlights. Kptlt. Heydemann reported about 10 lifeboats and 15 to 20 <b>liferafts</b> afloat and occupied. Heydemann did not try to question survivors to identify the ship, and claimed in his report that this was because the weather was poor.|$|E
25|$|On 16 October 1942 Primrose Hill sailed from Glasgow a {{mixed cargo}} {{including}} 3,000 tons of coal, 1,796 tons of general cargo, war material and 11 aircraft. She {{was as a}} member of convoy ON-139 for Takoradi on the Gold Coast and Apapa in Nigeria. The convoy dispersed, and at 2118 hrs on 29 October she was northwest of the Cape Verde Islands when UD-5, a submarine that the Kriegsmarine had captured from the Dutch Navy after the surrender of the Netherlands, fired two torpedoes at her. One missed but the other hit Primrose Hill in her engine room killing the second engineer, a greaser and a fireman, and setting the fuel oil in her bunkers on fire. Two of her lifeboats and a number of <b>liferafts</b> were destroyed by the concussion of the blast.|$|E
25|$|Pennsylvania {{departed}} Liverpool for Philadelphia at 2:30pm February 21, 1874, with {{a typical}} small winter-passage complement of two saloon and twelve steerage-class passengers, and some $250,000 of cargo. On {{the night of}} February 27, the ship ran into a hurricane on the open sea. Giant waves swept everything from the ship's decks and flooded the passenger saloon, while the ship struggled to retain headway. At around midnight, a mammoth wave slammed down upon the vessel, sweeping away all the lifeboats and <b>liferafts,</b> and breaking the foreboom and {{all four of the}} ship's forward hatches. Water began pouring into the holds, until they were about one quarter full. Tragically, the huge wave had also swept away the wheelhouse, the mate's house, and part of the wooden ship's bridge, taking with them the captain of the ship and four crew members, none of whom were ever seen again.|$|E
5000|$|The 7,628 ton [...] was {{completed}} in 1940. She was torpedoed by an Italian submarine in March 1943. 14 men had survived the sinking but after 50 days adrift in a <b>liferaft</b> only two were rescued alive.|$|R
50|$|By {{combining}} {{an innovative}} microbial filtration system, {{as well as}} robust electronics and mechanisms, Medicine Mondiale intend for the <b>Liferaft</b> infant incubator to be a 'plug and play' solution for neonatal healthcare facilities, requiring little or no maintenance.|$|R
50|$|The {{story begins}} with the protagonists riding on ship when a massive storm causes the vessel to sink. In the commotion, Skye manages {{to get on a}} <b>liferaft</b> while Keith plunges into the water, at which point he loses consciousness.|$|R
25|$|Mariella, {{the first}} of five ferries to reach {{the scene of the}} accident, arrived at 02:12. MRCC Turku failed to {{acknowledge}} the Mayday immediately and Mariellas report was relayed by Helsinki Radio as the less urgent pan-pan message. A full-scale emergency was only declared at 02:30. Mariella winched open <b>liferafts</b> into the sea onto which 13people on Estonias rafts successfully transferred, and reported the location of other rafts to Swedish and Finnish rescue helicopters, {{the first of}} which arrived at 03:05. The former took survivors to shore, while the latter—Finnish border guard helicopters Super Puma OH-HVG and Agusta Bell 412 OH-HVD—chose the riskier option of landing on the ferries. The pilot of OH-HVG stated that landing on the ferries was {{the most difficult part of}} the whole rescue operation; despite that, this single helicopter rescued 44people, more than all the ferries. Isabella saved 16 survivors with her rescue slide.|$|E
25|$|Typhoo tea {{is made in}} Moreton off the A551 next to Moreton railway station, and on {{the same}} site there is Manor Bakeries (Premier Foods, former Lyons Cakes, before April 1995) who make mini rolls, and a factory of Burton's Biscuit Company closed in December 2011 which made Cadbury's {{biscuits}} (Cadbury Fingers) and Wagon Wheels, where {{they still have a}} chocolate refinery. Bristol-Myers Squibb UK have their main research laboratories east of the Moreton bakery, near Leasowe railway station. Cereal Partners (Nestlé) make Cheerios and Golden Nuggets on the A41 opposite Port Sunlight at Bromborough, also the base of CSM UK, the baking ingredients company based at a former Unilever Stork margarine site. CML Group (part of Teledyne) makes composites and aircraft components off the A41 at Bromborough near Eastham Country Park. Stiebel Eltron UK (heat pumps) nearby, are near Meyer Prestige who make cookware (who also own Circulon and Anolon) and Givaudan UK have a fragrances factory. FMC Lithium, east of the A41 at Wirral International Business Park, makes butyllithium and other organometallic compounds. At Port Sunlight, Unilever make and research detergents and shampoo, such as Timotei and Sunsilk, as well as Comfort and Persil Liquid. Cammell Laird at Birkenhead build ships, and RFD Beaufort (known as Beaufort Air-Sea Equipment in the 1980s) make G-suits for fighter aircraft and <b>liferafts.</b> Eastham Refinery off junction 6 of the M53, at Eastham in Wirral, just north of Hooton Park (in Cheshire), is owned by Nynas.|$|E
500|$|At {{approximately}} 4:10am on 14 May 1943, {{while on}} her second run from Sydney to Port Moresby, Centaur was torpedoed by an unsighted submarine. The torpedo struck the portside oil fuel tank approximately [...] below the waterline, creating a hole [...] across, igniting the fuel, {{and setting the}} ship on fire from the bridge aft. Many of those on board were immediately killed by concussion or perished in the inferno. Centaur quickly took on water through the impact site, rolled to port, then sank bow-first, submerging completely {{in less than three}} minutes. The rapid sinking prevented the deployment of lifeboats, although two broke off from Centaur as she sank, along with several damaged <b>liferafts.</b>|$|E
50|$|Two Filipino {{crew members}} were rescued from a <b>liferaft</b> on 1 April by the cargo ship Elpida. The crew members {{reported}} that they had seen their ship sink. The other 22 crew members, 14 Filipinos and 8 South Koreans, remain missing.|$|R
25|$|In April 1967, Perth {{was ordered}} to Macquarie Island to rescue a seriously ill researcher. The ship arrived without incident, but {{conditions}} at the island were so adverse to boat handling that instead, the ship's diver swam ashore and back towing a <b>liferaft.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 19 March 1943 Leonardo da Vinci torpedoed {{and sank}} the 7,628 ton British cargo ship [...] in the South Atlantic. Leonardo da Vinci {{captured}} and took on board one survivor; {{two other men}} survived following a 50-day ordeal on a <b>liferaft.</b>|$|R
500|$|The MCIB {{released}} {{their full}} report on 11 February 2015. The {{report found that}} {{the main cause of}} the incident was that the ship had not been operated safely in compliance with international conventions, and that the direct cause of the ship's grounding was due to engine failure as a result of fresh water contamination of the engine's fuel, which occurred by human error when the water was taken on board in Brighton on 12 July 2013. It found a [...] "catalogue of failures and breaches of international regulations", including unsafe route planning that was influenced by photo opportunities rather than following the safest route, and it recommended that the master of the ship should always have authority to override courses during promotional activities {{to ensure the safety of}} the ship and its crew and passengers. It found that the SOLAS Conventions had been breached, and that the ship had not been certified as a passenger ship for either EU or international voyages, that the crew were not appropriately certified, and that the ship should not have been at sea. The <b>liferafts</b> were three months overdue of inspection, the Certificate of Seaworthiness was invalid, and the master's Certificate of Competency had expired a month before the accident. It also noted that mistakes were made with the mayday alert, causing a 10-minute delay in deploying the RNLI and Coast Guard, which could have had a significant impact if the conditions of the incident had been worse. The ship's owners were financially ruined by the incident.|$|E
2500|$|After {{attempting}} to contact [...] Concordia a Brazilian Air Force aircraft was dispatched at 17 hrs local time Thursday and sighted the <b>liferafts</b> 3 hours later.|$|E
2500|$|... 41 {{hours after}} the sinking the crew were safely aboard the rescue ships. All 64 people (48 students, eight {{teachers}} and eight crew) who were on board were rescued from 3 large and 1 small <b>liferafts.</b>|$|E
50|$|All Is Lost, the 2013 American {{survival}} film {{written and}} directed by J. C. Chandor and starring Robert Redford, includes turtling of the Cal 39 sailboat and the <b>liferaft</b> amidst the myriad disasters befalling the protagonist. This turtling results in a dismasting of the boat.|$|R
