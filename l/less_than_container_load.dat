40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy of the University ofBedford shireThis work investigates new approaches to the <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> problem which {{address the issue of}} how to load three-dimensional, rectangular items (e. g. boxes) into the container {{in such a way that}} maximum utilisation is made of the container space. This problem occurs in several industry sectors where the loading approach places cargo effectively into aeroplanes, ships, trailers or trucks in order to save considerable cost. In carrying out this work, the investigation starts by developing a new heuristic approach to the two-dimensional bin packing problem, which has lower complexity <b>than</b> <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> in the aspects of constraints and geometry. A novel approach, including the heuristic strategies and handling method for remaining areas, is developed that can produce good results when testing with benchmark and real world data. Based on the research for two-dimensional bin packing, a novel heuristic approach is developed to deal with the <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> problem with some practical constraints. The heuristic approach to <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> also includes heuristic strategies and the handling of remaining spaces. The heuristic strategies construct effective loading arrangements where combinations of identical or different box types are loaded in blocks. The handling method for remaining spaces further improves the loading arrangements through the representation, partitioning and merging of remaining spaces. The heuristic approach obtains better volume utilisation and the highest stability compared with other published heuristic approaches. However, it does not achieve as high a volume utilisation as metaheuristic approaches, e. g. genetic algorithms and tabu search. To improve volume utilisation, a new hybrid heuristic approach to the <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> problem is further developed based on the tabu search technique which covers the encoding, evaluation criterion and configuration of neighbourhood and candidate solutions. The heuristic strategies as well as the handling method for remaining spaces developed in the heuristic approach are used in this new hybrid tabu search approach. It is shown that the hybrid approach has better volume utilisation than the published approaches under the condition that all loaded boxes with one hundred per cent support from below. In addition, the experimental results show that both the heuristic and hybrid tabu search approaches can also be applied to the multiple <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> problem...|$|R

40|$|The freight {{forwarder}} has been threatened with 'disintermediation' for years. This research {{looks at the}} relationships in the global logistics triad comprising the forwarder, the shipper, and the airline or ocean carrier. The middle-man in service industries such as freight forwarding performs the service of intermediation. He is defined as one who reduces or {{eliminates the need for}} a buyer to form exchange relationships, ad hoc or relational, with a number of suppliers by concentrating the buyer's need for information at the buyer interface and expanding the buyer's requirement for choice or selection at the supplier interface. This vendor contraction and expansion are explored in the qualitative first phase of the research which examines the relationships, shared functions, and roles {{of the members of the}} global logistics triad as well as the contribution of the {{freight forwarder}}. Modal differences are prominent. Shippers are closer in a relational sense to ocean carriers than to airlines - the exporter is much more likely to use a shipping line directly than to use an airline. This modal difference owes much to the airfreight industry's origins in passenger transportation. It is reflected in the airlines' perspective of the forwarder: as customer because of forwarders' purchase of space, as competitor because the airline is being excluded from dealing directly with the shipper, and as collaborator because of the common threat of the integrator. To the ocean carrier, the forwarder is customer and competitor only - collaboration is rare. Factors that affect the custome r/competitor/colla boratort richotomy in airfreight include freight capacity, the level of forwarder commitment to space, the status freight has with the airline, and the makeup of the airline's customer portfolio. The factors that affect the customer/ competitor dichotomy in ocean freight include the extent of LCL (<b>Less</b> <b>than</b> <b>Container</b> <b>Load)</b> cargo and 3 PL (3 rd Party Logistics) services offered by the shipping line. The modal differences and complexities inherent in the global airfreight triad were explored in the subsequent quantitative phase. What value does the airfreight forwarder offer to the shipper that would compel him to not disintermediate this intermediary and deal directly with the airline? It is surmised the forwarder offers value through cost reduction, specifically the costs of transacting with a number of airlines. This second phase is based on Transaction Cost Analysis using an experiment-derived survey instrument. The transaction costs of searching for vendors, developing relationships with them, monitoring their performance, handling problems that may arise, and managing potential opportunistic behaviour were examined. The shi pper- respondents - made up of British global exporters who used airfreight - were asked to compare their perception of these costs for the forwarder and for the airline. They were also asked about production cost/price advantages as well as demographic information that was presumed to affect these perceptions. The differences between these perceptions of transaction costs were highly significant with the perception of offering lower transaction costs, and hence greater value, lying with the forwarder. The shippers also positively viewed forwarders regarding the production cost/price advantages. However, the demographic variables played little part in the shippers' differential perceptions of transaction costs. Contribution is made to Transaction Cost Theory by suggesting the inclusion of triadic relationships and the intermediary as a governance alternative. In addition, the freight forwarding industry and global distribution benefit. Finally, at the level of method, the TC comparison technique used offers a fresh approach to comparing primary and intermediary vendors...|$|E

40|$|Logistics plays a {{more and}} more {{important}} role in manufacturing company to sharp competitive in today’s supply chain integration. As the end of logistics in manufacturer, <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> intellectualization has attracted {{more and more}} focuses. Harmonious coordination between planning and execution ground high performance of the <b>container</b> <b>loading.</b> Several challenges exist in business operations. Firstly, <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> planning is time-consuming. Several case-based constraints exist in the optimization defined by different customers and the Customs. Secondly, execution driven by <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> is inefficient. Operators may use unclear or unreadable paper-based guidance during execution which is inconvenient to handle. Besides, due to various situations, shipping documentations are complex. Afterwards Order-picking, a critical part in executions, is a costly activity. Thirdly, coordination during whole <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> process is another challenge. Information sharing between planning and execution is delayed and inaccurate. The whole procedure usually cannot be monitored by managers in a remote office. Problems cannot be addressed without timely provision of data. This research targets to establish a smart <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> platform based on real life practices and constraints. Unlike common warehouse operation, warehouse executions are driven by <b>container</b> <b>loading.</b> To overcome the challenges, an integrated solution is proposed with three main parts. The first one is to establish RFID-enabled real-time smart environment where device-level data is collected timely with bidirectional communications under Wi-Fi occasionally connected situation. Secondly, Service-oriented Architecture (SOA) is applied in rule-based computation and heterogeneous information sources integration. In rule-based computation, constraint is computed and wrapped as rule. It {{is a kind of}} service which is restored in service repository according to its properties. Under different cases, several rules are addressed and invoked in a specified sequence to realize different business logics. And the platform should communicate with heterogeneous sources within short time. Systems wrap application programming interfaces (API) as web services which can be invoked flexibly at any time. Data fetch process is divided into several threads which extract data concurrently. Thirdly, <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> optimal model is provided based on practical constraints. Based on various rules, shipments are clustered as groups before <b>loading.</b> To <b>load</b> <b>containers</b> more equally, heuristic algorithm is provided with reducing container capacity continuously until other constraints are violated or more shipment groups are separated. Four contributions have been made in this study. Firstly, a five-layer system architecture is proposed for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) applications especially in occasionally connected network environment, rule-based computations, and efficient data exchanges. Secondly, several practical constraints of loading planning are addressed and a heuristic algorithm is designed. Shipments can be equally loaded while satisfying most conflicted constraints. Thirdly, a solution for auto-ID enabled warehouse execution is provided. The solution is driven by <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> equipped with real-time information capturing and processing. Fourthly, a guidance can be refereed for real life implementations in SME. The guidance summarizes system customization procedures with reengineered resources. published_or_final_versionIndustrial and Manufacturing Systems EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
