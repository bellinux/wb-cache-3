5|$|Epatiana succeeded {{his father}} as King of Rurutu around 1886, while still a young child. Due to historians' <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> about his birth year, sources differ on the actual age of Epatiana at the time. This early {{succession}} was a consequence of a decision taken in old age by Epatiana's father to abdicate and journey back to his homeland of Huahine, where he died shortly after arrival. The body of Teuruarii III was repatriated to Rurutu and interred in the royal cemetery. Because of Epatiana's youth and inexperience, his mother Taarouru served as regent for an indeterminate number of years until the prince was deemed fit to rule independently.|$|E
5|$|In the {{clinical}} sense, a disorder {{is a condition}} requiring treatment as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. There is a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> about the precise {{meaning of the term}} 'attachment disorder' although there is general agreement that such disorders only arise following early adverse caregiving experiences. Reactive attachment disorder indicates the absence of either or both the main aspects of proximity seeking to an identified attachment figure. This can occur either in institutions, or with repeated changes of caregiver, or from extremely neglectful primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs after the age of 6 months. Current official classifications of RAD under DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 are largely based on this {{understanding of the nature of}} attachment.|$|E
5|$|Despite the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> {{regarding}} the exact import of the inscription, scholars {{seem to agree}} that its language is some form of Gothic and that the intent behind it was religious. Taylor interprets the inscription as being clearly pagan in nature and indicative {{of the existence of}} a temple to which the ring was a votive offering. He derives his date for the burial (210 to 250) {{from the fact that the}} Christianizing of the Goths along the Danube is generally considered to have been almost complete within a few generations after their having arrived there in 238. Though paganism among the Goths did survive the initial conversion phase of 250 to 300 - as the martyring of the converted Christian Goths Wereka, Batwin (370) and Sabbas (372) at the hands of the indigenously pagan Goths (in the latter case Athanaric) shows - it was weakened considerably in the following years, and the likelihood of such a deposit being made would have been greatly diminished.|$|E

5|$|Randall {{stood against}} this measure, {{as he had}} against nearly all Reconstruction laws. A <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> delayed the bill from coming to a vote until the lame-duck session {{beginning}} in December 1874. By that time, disillusionment with the Grant administration and worsening economic conditions had translated into a Democratic victory in the mid-term elections. When the 44th Congress gathered in March 1875, the House would have a Democratic majority {{for the first time}} since the Civil War. In the meantime, the outgoing Republicans made one last effort to pass Sumner's civil rights bill; Randall and other Democrats immediately used parliamentary maneuvers to bring action to a stand-still, hoping to delay passage until the Congress ended. Randall led his caucus in filibustering the bill, at one point remaining on the floor for 72 hours. In the end, the Democrats peeled away some Republican votes, but not enough to defeat the bill, which passed by a vote of 162 to 100. Despite the defeat, Randall's filibuster increased his prominence in the eyes of his Democratic colleagues.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the main}} {{deficiencies}} in various factor analyses is a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> in cutting points for determining the number of latent factors.

25|$|Longer range {{communications}} {{have been}} proposed using infrastructure networks such as WiMAX (IEEE 802.16), Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), or 3G.

25|$|Additionally during 2008 {{and early}} 2009 a debate emerged within NASA over the {{presence}} of 'blobs' which appeared on photos of the vehicle's landing struts, which have been variously described as being either water droplets or 'clumps of frost'.

For plesiosaurs, this is made more difficult by the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> about their flipper stroke and gait. There are no exact calculations of their Reynolds Number. Fossil impressions show that the skin was relatively smooth, not scaled, and this may have reduced form drag. Small wrinkles are present in the skin that may have prevented separation of the laminar flow in the boundary layer and thereby reduced skin friction.|$|E

This has been accomplished through a consensus-building process that has included representatives from academia, the pharmaceutical industry, and government. The group has addressed obstacles to drug development that include (i) the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> a well-accepted instrument for measuring neurocognition in clinical trials; (ii) the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> a <b>consensus</b> on the best molecular target or targets for drug development; (iii) the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> a <b>consensus</b> regarding the optimal trial design for either comedication that improves cognition when added to an antipsychotic or a broad spectrum agent that improves cognition and treats psychosis; and (iv) the approaches of regulatory {{agencies such as the}} US Food and Drug Administration to approving and labeling a new agent...|$|R

25|$|Italian {{unification}} was {{the political}} and social movement that annexed different states of the Italian peninsula into the single state of Italy in the 19th century. There is a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> on the exact dates for {{the beginning and the end}} of this period, but many scholars agree that the process began with the end of Napoleonic rule and the Congress of Vienna in 1815, and approximately ended with the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, though the last città irredente did not join the Kingdom of Italy until after World War I.|$|E
25|$|Logie (1995) {{proposed}} that the visuo-spatial sketchpad is broken down into two subcomponents, one visual and one spatial. These are the visual cache and the inner scribe, respectively. The visual cache is a temporary visual store including such dimensions as colour and shape. Conversely, the inner scribe is a rehearsal mechanism for visual information and is responsible for information concerning movement sequences. Although a general <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> regarding this distinction has been noted in the literature, {{there is a growing}} amount of evidence that the two components are separate and serve different functions.|$|E

25|$|The biggest {{criticism}} of the traditional zonal system based 5 member selection committee {{is that of the}} interest served by the committee members. The popular opinion is that the selectors constantly engage in promoting the interests of players from their zone or vote on players based on cross-promotion from other zones instead of selecting the best available team. BCCI tried addressing the issue as part of its Shashank Manohar led constitution review committee in 2006. However, a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> and concerns by zonal heads scuttled any efforts to reduce the 5 member committee to a 3 or 4 member national committee.|$|E
25|$|The {{literary}} {{genre of}} science fiction is diverse, and its exact definition remains a contested question among both scholars and devotees. This <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> is reflected in debates about the genre's history, particularly over determining its exact origins. There are two broad camps of thought, one that identifies the genre's roots in early fantastical works such as the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh (earliest Sumerian text versions c. 2150–2000 BCE). A second approach argues that science fiction only became possible sometime between the 17th and early 19th centuries, following the scientific revolution and major discoveries in astronomy, physics, and mathematics.|$|E
25|$|The Schengen Agreement {{was signed}} {{independently}} of the European Union, in part owing to the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> amongst EU member states {{over whether or not}} the EU had the jurisdiction to abolish border controls, and in part because those ready to implement the idea did not wish to wait for others (at this time there was no enhanced co-operation mechanism). The Agreement provided for harmonisation of visa policies, allowing residents in border areas the freedom to cross borders away from fixed checkpoints, the replacement of passport checks with visual surveillance of vehicles at reduced speed, and vehicle checks that allowed vehicles to cross borders without stopping.|$|E
