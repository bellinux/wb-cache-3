30|$|Nonetheless, one {{implication}} {{of these findings}} is that the shift in Swedish policy in the early 1990 s, from discouraging foreign investors to encouraging them, appears to be working as intended. For those sectors where an owner-specific effect on efficiency is at all discernible, the effect of foreign ownership is to reduce inefficiency. As noted in the literature review, foreign investors in other countries have frequently found that transactions costs associated with <b>locating</b> <b>part</b> of their production away from their home country reduce the efficiency of their operations, reducing the productivity gains from foreign ownership. We find no such effect {{for any of the}} Swedish sectors studied in this paper.|$|E
40|$|The {{value of}} world trade has {{increased}} 27 -fold since 1950, three time more that the growth of global GDP. An increasing share of that trade involves international supply chains and the global fragmentation of production. But many countries do not participate intensively in this process. One reason is that variety of policies increase supply chain costs and inhibit firms from <b>locating</b> <b>part</b> of their supply chain to a country or region. This paper argues for a new approach by governments and the business community to identify and reduce supply chain barriers, including {{in the context of}} international trade agreements. Using trade agreements to lower trade costs that negatively affect the operation of supply networks would help increase their welfare impact and their relevance to business...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to examine {{possibilities}} to improve energy efficiency of data center cooling. Data centers form the ground for the telecommunication business. Energy consumption of the data centers is already globally significant because data centers consumed 1. 1 - 1. 5 % of world’s electricity use in 2010, and about 40 % of that is used for cooling. Enhancement of the data center cooling has a good potential to reduce energy consumption, greenhouse gases, and costs of telecommunication. This thesis {{is divided into two}} parts. The first part will offer a basic theoretical background for the data centers and their cooling systems as well as issues related to thermal management of data center. The second part consists of case study made for Finnish data centers <b>locating</b> <b>part</b> of the office building. Power usage effectiveness (PUE) were inspected and evaluated for the data centers of the building. The close liquid cooled system were compared to the traditionally air cooled system using measurements. Air flow problems at the data centers were discussed. The effects of free cooling and district cooling to the cooling system and energy consumption were discussed. PUE-value of the examined building varied between 1. 2 and 1. 8. Comprehensive, real-time and partial monitoring of PUE is demanding, but inserting a few fixed measurements, PUE-value can be defined. Using close liquid cooling, the power density of IT equipment can be higher than with traditional air cooling. Close liquid cooling had minor effect on the PUE-value. The traditional vapor compression cooling system is energy intensive, but it can be replaced, entirely or partly, by free cooling which utilizes coldness of outdoor air, water or ground. District cooling would decrease PUE-value and energy consumption of cooling, especially in summer, when air cooling based free cooling is not in use...|$|E
