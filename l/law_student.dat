40|$|Recent {{literature}} on legal ethics, professionalism and legal educa¬tion {{has shown that}} little work is done on studying and com¬paring the ethical values of <b>law</b> <b>students</b> in Southeast Asia. This paper reports on the empirical findings of {{a study on the}} ethical values of Hong Kong and Malaysian <b>law</b> <b>students,</b> which is part of a wider study of the values of <b>law</b> <b>students</b> in the Asian Region adapting a questionnaire from the study of values of Australian <b>law</b> <b>students</b> by Evans and Palermo (2002). The paper sought and compared the responses that Hong Kong and Malaysian <b>law</b> <b>students</b> made to eight scenarios containing different ethical dilemmas. This paper evaluates what values are empirically important in determining the decisions of <b>law</b> <b>students</b> in Hong Kong and Malaysia towards similar scenarios containing ethical dilemmas. It also compares the value orientations of <b>law</b> <b>students</b> and gen¬der differences in the value hierarchies of <b>law</b> <b>students</b> in Hong Kong and Malaysia, two common law jurisdictions in Southeast Asia. This paper is significant as it represents the first empirical legal research project undertaken on comparing the values of <b>law</b> <b>students</b> in Hong Kong and Malaysia. It contributes to academic discourse on professional socialization of law schools and value system of <b>law</b> <b>students</b> in the Asian Region, and also contributes to the teaching of legal ethics and professionalism as well as the reform of law school curriculum in the Asian Region.

40|$|A certain {{percentage}} of <b>law</b> <b>students</b> come with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) or with another learning disability, either disclosed or undisclosed. Yet {{there has been little}} empirical research on how <b>law</b> <b>students</b> with learning disabilities read and understand the law. This study examined how three <b>law</b> <b>students</b> with ADD read a judicial opinion. The results suggested a relationship between successful law school performance and the use of problematizing and rhetorical reading strategies; and less successful law school performance and the use of default reading strategies. Results suggest that <b>law</b> <b>students</b> with ADD can be successful and productive members of any law school community. Becoming an effective legal reader {{may be one of the}} most important ways <b>law</b> <b>students</b> with ADD can enhance their law school success...|$|R

40|$|Conference Theme: Legal Ethics at a Time of Regulatory ChangeSession 9 C: CultureThis {{research}} undertakes {{a comparative}} study {{of the values of}} <b>law</b> <b>students</b> in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. This project attempts to answer four research questions. Firstly, what values are empirically important in determining the behaviors and ethical decision-making of <b>law</b> <b>students</b> in Hong Kong, Mainland China and Taiwan? Secondly, whether there is a common core of values shared by <b>law</b> <b>students</b> in these three Chinese places? Thirdly, whether there are differences in value orientations of <b>law</b> <b>students</b> in these three areas? Finally, whether there is a gender difference in the value hierarchies of <b>law</b> <b>students</b> in the Greater China Region? This paper will present some of the interim findings of our research project. This project is significant as it represents the first empirical legal research project undertaken in the Greater China Region on the values of <b>law</b> <b>students</b> and lawyers. It will make original contribution to the academic discourse on value system of lawyers and <b>law</b> <b>students.</b> It will also contribute to the teaching of legal ethics and professionalism as well as the reform of law school curriculum in this fast developing area of the world...|$|R

Surprisingly, male and female <b>law</b> <b>students</b> reported equal self-efficacy to manage work-life conflict. Therefore, the study suggests that the decision to opt out of legal careers likely occurs more at the workplace level and is less attributed to pre-career commitment or self-efficacy levels...|$|R

5|$|In 1985, Goldstone {{ruled that}} the government's mass sacking of 1,700 black staff at Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto had been illegal. The {{following}} year, {{he was the first}} judge to free a political prisoner who had been detained under a recently imposed state of emergency under which the government had given itself draconian police powers. Another important ruling against the state in 1988 resulted in the release of a detainee who had not been advised by the police that he was entitled to a lawyer. In 1989, Goldstone became the first South African judge under apartheid to take on a black law clerk, an African-American Yale <b>Law</b> <b>student</b> named Vernon Grigg. Goldstone also used his judicial prerogatives to visit thousands of people who had been imprisoned without trial, including some who later became members of the post-apartheid South African government. Although he could do little to free them, his visits served to reassure the prisoners – and serve notice to the prison administration – that someone in a position of power was taking an active interest in their well-being. Few white judges at the time enjoyed the trust and respect of the black majority; Goldstone became a notable exception.|$|E

40|$|The {{personalities of}} lawyers are often {{categorized}} to be immoral, at least {{more so than}} those of other professionals. An abundance of literature parallels this generalization and depicts lawyers’ personalities as narcissistic, psychopathic and high in Machiavellian attitudes. Together, these three traits form the “Dark Triad” of personality. 53 <b>law</b> <b>students</b> from 3 <b>law</b> schools in Ontario completed a survey measuring their levels on the “Dark Triad”. Results show that the <b>law</b> <b>students</b> from the present sample do not display any “Dark Triad” trait significantly greater than the general population. It found that male <b>law</b> <b>students</b> were not significantly “darker” than female <b>law</b> <b>students.</b> 1 st year <b>law</b> <b>students</b> were found to score significantly higher on the narcissism trait than both second and third-year students. There were no other {{significant differences between the}} students in different years of schooling. Those entering criminal law scored significantly higher on Machiavellianism than those entering tax law. No other fields of law differed significantly on any trait. These findings suggest that <b>law</b> <b>students</b> are not deserving of the pejorative stereotype assigned to them. It suggests that male <b>law</b> <b>students</b> are no more responsible for the stereotype than females. The present research implies that law school may actually reduce the narcissism trait suggested to be present in <b>law</b> <b>students.</b> Lastly, those aspiring to enter criminal law may be more responsible for the stereotype whereas those aspiring to enter tax law experience the most apparent wrongful stereotyping...|$|R
