40|$|In {{this final}} {{technical}} report, UTSI summarizes work completed under DOE Contract No. DE-AC 22 - 95 PC 95231. This work {{began on the}} contract effective date, September 15, 1995 and is continuing on a very small basis to complete the groundwater remediation as of this date. The work scope required UTSI to continue to maintain the DOE Coal Fired Flow Facility and keep it in readiness for anticipated testing. This effort was terminated in September 1998 by DOE stop-work letter. Work continued on reporting, environmental restoration and on the High Temperature Superconductivity work that was underway. The work included preparing reports on the MHD POC tests that had been completed just prior to this contract initiation under an earlier contract with DOE Chicago. These four reports are summarized herein. This report summarizes the environmental restoration work performed under the contract, including groundwater monitoring and remediation, removal of wastes from the facility, removal of asbestos from the cooling tower and actions {{in compliance with the}} <b>license</b> <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> water into Woods Reservoir. This report covers work in support of the DOE High Temperature Superconductivity program including: (1) Assistance to DOE in preparing a development plan; (2) Cooperation with industry, national laboratories and other universities to promote the commercialization of thin film superconductors (coated conductors); (3) Process Evaluations; (4) Process Diagnostic Development; and (5) Process Economics. The assistance to DOE task included convening an advisory board composed of all the major participants in the DOE program and preparing a draft development plan and Research and Development Roadmap leading to commercialization of the coated conductor technology. Under this program, cooperative agreements and cooperative work was undertaken with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Midwest Superconductivity, Inc., EURUS Technologies, Inc., Westinghouse Electric Company, and others. In the process evaluation task, four studies were completed by faculty, staff and students. Summaries of these studies are included in this report. In process diagnostic development, three studies were completed, all emphasizing diagnostics that are applicable to real time control of manufacturing processes. In Process Economics, one study was completed that estimated the manufacturing cost of superconducting wire produced by two of the process thought to be most promising...|$|E

At the federal level, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) sets forth a set of codes which give the minimum standards of display fireworks use and safety in the US. Both state and local jurisdictions can further add restrictions on the use and safety requirements of display fireworks. Typically, these jurisdictions will require a <b>licensed</b> operator <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> the show. Although requirements vary from state <b>to</b> state, <b>licensed</b> operators and their crew are typically required to have hours of extensive training in the Safe use of display fireworks.|$|R

50|$|His {{appointment}} at Haddington he exchanged {{for a similar}} one at Kirkcaldy, Fife, in 1812. Completing his divinity studies {{by a series of}} partial sessions, he was <b>licensed</b> <b>to</b> preach in June 1815, but continued <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> his scholastic duties for three years. He devoted his leisure, not only to mathematical and physical science, but to a course of reading in English literature, his bias towards the antique in sentiment and style being strengthened by a perusal of the older classics, among whom Richard Hooker was his favorite author. At the same time his love of the marvellous found gratification in the wonders of the Arabian Nights, and it is further characteristically related of him that he used to carry continually in his waistcoat pocket a miniature copy of Ossian, passages from which he frequently recited with sonorous elocution and vehement gesticulation.|$|R

He continued <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> in full the duties of this office, until 1854, when, having completed his 82nd year, was released from the charge of the pulpit, and a colleague was employed. He retained his activity until a fortnight before his death. In fulfilment of a promise exacted of him many years previous, a discourse was preached at his funeral by Rev. Dr. Sprague of Albany. This has since been published. (Albany, 1860, pp. 38, 8vo.) ...|$|R
