40|$|Abstract This article {{employs the}} decolonial {{thinking}} paradigm {{to dispel the}} long-held myth that <b>Local</b> Economic <b>Development</b> <b>strategies</b> are universal panacea that can result in the <b>development</b> of all <b>local</b> economies globally. It is opined in this article that the growing literature celebrating the salience of <b>Local</b> Economic <b>Development</b> <b>strategies</b> often downplay how these strategies at times result in the reproduction of economic inequalities. This is primarily so in cities of the Global South which remain weighed down by the burden of colonial and apartheid history. For these repressive systems of governance relegated the colonised to the zones of non-being where opportunities for economic development and self-realisation were deliberately foreclosed. As will be made apparent below, the burden of colonial and apartheid history did not miraculously disappear {{with the advent of}} political independence. Instead, the spectre of coloniality – defined as the continuation of economic, socio-spatial and epistemological domination of the hitherto colonised, still looms large. The primary argument advanced here, therefore, is that <b>Local</b> Economic <b>Development</b> <b>strategies</b> implemented in highly socio-spatially fragmented and economically uneven societies can further exacerbate these inequalities. The case of post-apartheid South Africa is used to highlight how <b>Local</b> Economic <b>Development</b> <b>strategies</b> implemented in highly divided societies often reproduce economic and socio-spatial inequalities...|$|R
