40|$|This paper {{describes}} engineering applications {{which show}} the engineering significance of testing the phase composition of soils, including determining {{the level of}} water saturation. It further explains why, in order to accurately model in situ conditions in soil deposits, {{it is necessary to}} test the phase composition of soil under conditions of horizontal restraint and changing moisture content. The paper reviews the <b>lineal</b> <b>measurement</b> method of Sibley and Williams (1989), which was initially developed to test unrestrained clays. The method has now been adapted for use in characterizing phase relationships in horizontally restrained soil specimens undergoing drying. Results obtained using the new test have drawn {{attention to the fact that}} while soils undergoing drying are invariably restrained by naturally occurring mechanisms, the level of this restraint may vary widely. A useful index of the level of restraint applied to a slurried soil specimen undergoing drying is the moisture content at which initially 1 -D (vertical) shrinkage behavior becomes isotropi...|$|E
30|$|Inter and intra-examiner {{reliability}} was assessed with the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). All cephalometric values were greater than 0.979 (CI 95  % 0.954 – 0.999). In addition, the Dahlberg error {{was less than}} 1 ° for all angular measurements and 1  mm for all <b>lineal</b> <b>measurements.</b> All the cephalometric tracings were made {{with at least a}} 1 -month interval between them and were performed by the same two different examiners.|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of machine vision in orchard was considered in context of mango crop load (fruit number and fruit size). An algorithm for automatic detection and counting of fruits in images {{of trees in}} orchard was developed. RGB images were acquired of two sides of mango trees (‘dual view’). Fruit count per tree was obtained by harvest of trees, and by manual count of fruit in images. The R 2 and slope between dual-view and harvest count varied between 0. 74 and 0. 92, and 0. 34 and 0. 55, respectively, depending on canopy structure. The fruit counting model involved: (i) fruit-like object detection using HAAR cascade classifier using an AdaBoost technique; (ii) classification of detected region using a multilayer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The machine vision count achieved a precision = 0. 94, recall= 0. 89, and F 1 score = 0. 9 against a human count of fruit in images. For the estimation of fruit size individual fruits were imaged against a backing board (with a circular scale printed on a blue background), with an RMSE of 3. 6 mm for <b>lineal</b> dimension <b>measurement</b> achieved...|$|R
40|$|Background : Klammt open elastic {{activator}} and twin blocks {{have been}} {{two of the most}} worldwide studied functional appliances; however, there are different opinions about their effect on the cranium-facial complex. Objective : To determine the efficacy of these appliances in the functional treatment in Class II division I syndrome in early mixed teething. Methods : Prospective, cuasi experimental, “before-after” study without control group, including all children between 6 and 9 years of Area II in Cienfuegos municipality. After applying inclusion criteria, 20 patients were selected through simple randomized sampling and distributed in two groups, one for each technique. Lateral cranium teleradiographies were taken at the beginning and after a year of treatment, and <b>lineal</b> and/or angular <b>measurements</b> of Steiner, Ricketts, McNamara and Legan Burstone cephalograms were applied. Results : Favourable changes in cranium lateral radiographies measurements were obtained mainly from therapy with twin blocks. There was a decrease in the angle formed by the joint planes nasion-point A and nasion-point B and facial convexity, increase in mandible length and inferior facial height. Nasolabial angle and labial protuberance didn´t increase significantly. Conclusions : treated patients positively modified their bio-typology, and growth trend showed positive variations during functional therapy. </p...|$|R
