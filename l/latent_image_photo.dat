25|$|In 1993 Indigo {{launched}} the E-Print 1000 at IPEX trade show. The E-Print 1000 eliminated the expense and labor of the plate-printing setup process, printing {{directly from a}} computer file, and enabled inexpensive short-run color printing. Images not only could be readily changed, they could be changed from page to page, requiring neither additional setup or pauses in the print run. Instead of printing to metal plates, the E-Print created a <b>latent</b> <b>image</b> on the <b>Photo</b> <b>Imaging</b> Plate or PIP {{through the use of}} an electrostatic charge. This charged area would then attract the charged ElectroInk, which would in turn be transferred to the ITM or blanket, and then again transfer from the blanket to the paper or other substrate. Because 100% of the ink transfers from PIP to blanket to substrate, a different image and color could be printed with each rotation of the press. At the same time, Indigo's ElectroInk-based color inks offered print quality rivaling that of traditional printing processes. Almost 20 years later, and despite the numerous technological improvements, Indigo presses are still based on this core technology.|$|R

25|$|During film {{development}} the <b>latent</b> <b>image</b> is {{intensified by}} {{addition of a}} chemical, typically hydroquinone, that selectivity reduces those grains which contain atoms of silver. The process, which is sensitive to temperature and concentration, will completely reduce grains to silver metal, intensifying the <b>latent</b> <b>image</b> {{on the order of}} 1010 to 1011. This step demonstrates the advantage and superiority of silver halides over other systems: the <b>latent</b> <b>image,</b> which takes only milliseconds to form and is invisible, is sufficient to produce a full image from it.|$|R
40|$|The “AIMS ™ fab 193 ” 2 tool is {{an aerial}} image {{measurement}} system for ArF-lithography emulation {{and is in}} operation worldwide. By adjustment of numerical aperture, illumination type and partial coherence parameter to match the conditions in 193 nm steppers or scanners, it can emulate lithographic exposure tools for any type of reticles such as binary masks, OPC and phase shift structures, down to the 65 nm node. The AIMS ™ fab 193 allows the rapid prediction of wafer printability of critical features, such as dense patterns or contacts, defects or repairs on masks without the need to prepare real wafer prints using the stepper or scanner. Recently, a high resolution mode has been introduced based on a sophisticated microscope objective, characterized by a high numerical aperture (NA) and large working distance that allows working with pellicle mounted mask. With this lens system a high contrast image with resolution down to 150 nm lines and spaces (L/S) on mask has been demonstrated. In addition to the AIMS ™ through-focus mode for printability which is optically equivalent to the <b>latent</b> <b>image</b> in the <b>photo</b> resist of a wafer, the high resolution mode allows the imaging of mask structures in focus and at printing wavelength to review defects or repairs. Such viewing capability is also helpful at the binary stage of a first writing step in the mask manufacturing process.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the photographic emulsion {{is an important factor}} in the resolution of autoradiographs at the electron microscopic level. In a number of recent publications, single hit processes have been considered sufficient for the production of developable <b>latent</b> <b>images</b> by tritium electrons. However, since the absorbed energy required or <b>latent</b> <b>image</b> formation in AgBr crystals of commercially available emulsions is of the order of 800 eV, onIy low energy tritium electrons (up to 3 keV) will produce <b>latent</b> <b>images</b> by single hit processes in small AgBr crystals of about 400 A diameter. In emulsions with larger AgBr crystals (about 1000 A diameter), electrons with an energy of up to about 6 keV can be regisiered by single hit processes. Evidently, <b>latent</b> <b>image</b> formation may also result from multiple hits by electrons of higher energy. Since the energy absorption required for <b>latent</b> <b>image</b> formation is constant, the {{sensitivity of}} photographic emulsions must be considered proportional to the diameter of the respective AgBr crystals, unless methods become available for specific sensitization of emulsions with small AgBr crystals...|$|R
