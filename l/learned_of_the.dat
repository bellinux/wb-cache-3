5|$|After {{his father}} died in 1077, John {{remained}} in his grandfather's estates in Thrace, and was raised by him.

This research is quantitative research using treatment design by level 2 x 2. The research data {{was taken from the}} observation, tests and questionnaires. The results showed that (1) <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> history’s outcomes <b>of</b> students using investigative group learning are better than <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> history’s outcomes using conventional teaching methods, (2) there is interaction between learning method and critical thinking ability toward <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> history’s outcomes <b>of</b> students; (3) <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> history’s outcomes <b>of</b> students using <b>learning</b> methods investigation group with high critical thinking skills are better than learners who learn using conventional learning methods, (4) <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> history’s outcomes <b>of</b> students using conventional teaching methods with low critical thinking skills are better than students using the investigative group learning method with the ability to think critically low. Theoretically, <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> this study {{can be used as a}} reference for developing teaching methods in teaching history in the high school. Furthermore, there is research that is expected to use different teaching methods with other independent variables that influence student <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> history’s outcomes...|$|R

Timothy Shelley was furious when he <b>learned</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expulsion, but John Hogg was not minded to {{discipline}} his son or to forbid him from associating with Percy Shelley. Prudentia Hogg, who was an Evangelical Christian, was shocked when she learned that her son was promoting atheism. She was further angered when she learned that her son had become a vegetarian, a decision that she attributed to Shelley's corrupting influence.|$|E
5|$|Although the Inaccessible Island rail {{may have}} been known to the Tristan Islanders who visited the island {{annually}} to hunt seals, the species first {{came to the attention of}} scientists during the Challenger expedition of 1872–1876. When the expedition visited the island in October 1873, Sir Charles Wyville Thomson <b>learned</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species and recorded observations made by two German brothers, the Stoltenhoffs, who had been living on the island for the last two years. Thomson was unable to collect a specimen, much to his regret.|$|E
5|$|Applewhite {{moved to}} New York City in an {{unsuccessful}} attempt {{to launch a}} professional singing career upon finishing his education in Colorado. He then taught at the University of Alabama. He lost his position there after pursuing {{a sexual relationship with}} a male student; his religious education was likely not supportive of same-sex relationships and he was subsequently frustrated by his sexual desires. He separated from his wife when she <b>learned</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> affair in 1965, and they divorced three years later.|$|E

Newspapers throughout the Lake Superior region ran editorials condemning the removal effort. Buffalo sent two of his sons to St. Paul, the state capital, where they obtained a portion of the annuities still owed.|$|E

Burton continued to represent Rialto before the Postmaster, and draw his monthly salary, for five months. Burton's intervention was successful, and the Postmaster's investigation was ceased without the entry of a fraud order.|$|E

He wrote to his brother's commanding officer, Sholto Douglas asking for any news but understanding the Major's attention was now fixed on the German Spring Offensive.

Hadl's analysis was that Donkey Kongs storyline was based on that of King Kong and was thus an infringement of Universal's rights to that film's characters and scenario.|$|E
