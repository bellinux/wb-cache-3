40|$|Policy {{conditionality}} {{has been}} a frequently used tool {{in the context of}} the Euro zone crisis management. By linking the disbursement of <b>loan</b> <b>instalments</b> to specific policy requirements the macro-economic adjustment programmes used conditionality as leverage to promote structural reforms. How does conditionality induce policy change? This central question is examined by considering conditionality as a ‘mega’ policy instrument that seeks to guide the domestic policy system and define its reform trajectory. Policy conditionality thus determines the areas of reform and prescribes their direction while also defining the means and timeframe within which they have to be implemented. Conditionality impacts on domestic governance and transforms the policy making system into a compliance and implementation mechanism. The paper argues that the reform potential of conditionality relies on its interaction with the domestic political system and policy process. A public policy lens can help to better understand the dynamics inherent in this process as well as highlight the strengths and limitations of conditionality. Following the conventional stages of public policy, the contribution focuses on the political challenges involved and sketches out a prospective empirical research agenda...|$|R
40|$|Before the crisis, {{cross-border}} {{funding in}} foreign currencies strongly acceler-ated. Foreign currency lending to house-holds {{and to other}} unhedged borrowers was prevalent, implying significant currency risks for the borrowers as well as credit and funding risks for the lenders. When the crisis erupted in 2008, large vulnerabilities {{in the form of}} excessive leverage and foreign cur-rency loans were exposed. On the one hand, cross-border net lending turned negative and new loan syndications dropped sharply. On the other hand, weakening currencies inflated <b>loan</b> <b>instalments</b> and caused financial diffi-culties for unhedged borrowers. These problems have stressed the necessity for measures to strengthen local currency funding and lending by developing domestic capital markets as well as by encouraging long-term savings and investments. 1 This paper is structured as follows: Section 1 summarizes the benefits of developed capital markets. In section 2 the main characteristics of capital markets in CESEE are presented, while section 3 identifies necessary conditions for a developed capital market and subsequently explores to what extent CESEE countries fulfill these conditions.

40|$|In 1961 Kenya {{embarked}} on a program of agricultural reform called the Million Acre Settlement Scheme providing for the transfer of ownership {{of land in the}} Rift Valley from outgoing white settlers to local farmers. These new settlers were given loans by the Kenya Government {{to cover the cost of}} the purchase of their plots and of certain development inputs. Over course of time most of these farmers have fallen heavily into arrears with repayment of their loans and this problem provides the focus for this study of problems of farmers on the settlement schemes, which has the ultimate objective of making recommendations for improving the present poor rate of repayment. Not unexpectedly overall income was found to be the crucial factor affecting rates of repayment, however the relationship of size of income to rate of repayment is not straightforward as other factors intervene, especially patterns of expenditure, and more importantly perhaps to any solution are those which indirectly affect rates of repayment through their influence on income levels. It was furthermore discovered that some <b>loan</b> <b>instalments</b> are never credited due to poor administration and that the quality of administration permeates many other variables. This is a purely introductory paper since most data is still being analysed and few figures are adduced in support of the main arguments, which should be taken as provisional in nature.

Using an Italian dataset of <b>instalment</b> <b>loans</b> between 1995 - 1999, we first show that the {{variation}} persists even after controlling for contract and individual-specific characteristics, and for the potential selection bias due to credit rationing. We explore whether the residual variation in default rates across different types of goods is due to unobserved individual heterogeneity (selection effect) or due {{to the effect of}} the specific characteristics of the good (good effect). We claim that the two effects may be interpreted as adverse selection and moral hazard. We exploit the data on multiple contracts per individual to disentangle the two effects, and find that both contribute to the residual variation. The selection effect, however, is more prevalent: individuals who buy motorcycles on credit are more likely to default on any loan, while those buying kitchen appliances, furniture and computers are more likely to repay, compared to average. The good effect is present only for two goods: new cars, which increase the incentive to repay, and mobile phones, which reduce it. We conclude that there is asymmetric information in the consumer credit market, in the form of both adverse selection and moral hazard. consumer credit, default, adverse selection, moral hazard...|$|R

With the intention of being both a cross-check and motivation for the micro analysis, we estimate a structural vector auto regression using macro variables. A key result of the macro analysis is that positive house price innovations have positive and persistent effects on households debt secured on dwellings. Results from the micro data analysis suggest that {{the effect of}} house price changes on the borrowing decision differs from the effect on the instalment decision among existing home owners. These results are further investigated trough a two stage model where we control for income, collateral value and age. The model predicts that the size of both <b>loans</b> and <b>instalments</b> increase with income. Loan sizes increase and the instalments fall with increasing collateral value.

40|$|M. Sc. (Agric. Economics) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2005 The main {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate the causes underlining small-farmers default on bank loan repayments in the North West Province. One hundred and sixty farmers were randomly selected to be part of the sample. Questionnaires were issued to both farmers and bank officials. Descriptive statistics, correlation and regression models were used to analyse the data. The overall results indicate that most of the small farmers are in the old age category (58 years on average) with very low educational level. This scenario poses a challenge to the stakeholders in agriculture specifically the succession plan to these elderly people when they leave agriculture due to retirement. It was revealed by the study that the farmers do not keep either financial or production records. The analysis shows that the small farmers lack skills in financial management therefore, they are unable to execute the prerequisite to modern farming which are literacy and numeracy as indicated by Woohall et. al.,(1985). Most of the respondents have outstanding debt from Agribank yet they received loans from Landbank. Because of their low production and other many responsibilities, they are unable to repay <b>loan</b> <b>instalments</b> thus leading to loan default to their current financial supplier, which is Landbank. Lack of monitoring of loan funds was identified as one of the causes of the farmers Joan default. The analysis also indicates that the small farmers have access to finance but the major problem is lack of financial management skills, more involvement in household responsibilities, and lack of technical assistance from relevant stakeholders like extension officers and project managers from the bank or from the Department of Agriculture. Since the Land bank have no field officers to assist the farmers, it is recommended that the bank should have field officers to assist farmers in their business, especially with production, marketing, financial management and farm management Skills. The inability of the farmers to access good value markets for their products was identified as one of the problems, which led to loan default because the farmers are unable to market their products at the right time for good value in excess of their cost. It is recommended that financial institutions should assist their clients to access better markets for their products for better price which will in turn give them better income in order to repay their loans.

40|$|The drop in Ukraine’s GDP {{by nearly}} 18 % {{in the first}} three months of 2015 (versus the {{corresponding}} period in 2014) has confirmed the decline of the country’s economy. Over the last 14 months, the Ukrainian currency was subject to an almost threefold devaluation against the US dollar, and in April 2015 the inflation rate was 61 % (year-on-year), which exacerbated the impoverishment of the general public and weakened domestic demand. The main reason behind the crisis has been the destruction of heavy industry and infrastructure in the war-torn Donbas region, over which Kyiv no longer has control, as well as a sharp decline in foreign trade (by 24 % in 2014 and by 34 % in the first quarter of 2015), recorded primarily in trading volume with Ukraine’s major trade partner, i. e. Russia (a drop of 43 %). The conflict has also had a negative impact on the production figures for the two key sectors of the Ukrainian economy: agriculture and metallurgy, which account for approximately 50 % of Ukrainian exports. The government’s response to the crisis has primarily been a reduction in the costs of financing the Donbas and an increase in the financial burden placed on the citizens and companies of Ukraine. No radical reforms which would encompass the entire system, including anti-corruption reforms, have been carried out to stop the embezzlement of state funds and to facilitate business activity. The reasons for not initiating reforms have included the lack of will to launch them, Ukraine’s traditionally slow pace of bureaucratic action and growing dissonance among the parties making up the parliamentary coalition. The few positive changes, including marketisation of energy prices and sustaining budgetary discipline (in the first quarter of 2015, budgetary revenues grew by 25 %, though partly as a result of currency devaluation), are being carried out under pressure from the International Monetary Fund, which is making the payment of further <b>loan</b> <b>instalments</b> to the tune of US$ 17. 5 billion conditional upon reforms. Despite assistance granted by Western institutional donors and by individual states, the risk of Ukraine going bankrupt remains real. The issue of restructuring foreign debt worth US$ 15 billion has not been resolved, as foreign creditors who hold Ukrainian bonds have not consented to any partial cancellation of the debt. Whether Ukraine’s public finances can be stabilised will depend mainly on the situation in the east of the country and on the possible renewal of military action. It seems that the only way to rescue Ukraine’s public finances from deteriorating further is to continue to ‘freeze’ the conflict, to gradually implement wide-ranging reforms and to reach a consensus in negotiations with lenders...|$|R
40|$|M. Com. (Financial Management) Abstract: The {{rural poor}} with no {{physical}} collateral typically have virtually {{no access to}} small business financing. The microfinance movement replaces physical collateral with social collateral {{as a means for}} rural poor persons to gain access to financing for their microbusinesses. Microfinance entails lending to self-formed groups of close-knit community members who are jointly liable for loans advanced to individual group members. Advantages include borrower screening by fellow group members, mutual assistance in micro-enterprises, monitoring repayment and imposing social sanctions to delinquent group members. Despite the use of group lending, Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) are still faced with the risk of default by borrowers and the absence of physical collateral means there is no recourse to borrower assets for repayment. Default on loans, which can be caused by characteristics of the lending groups themselves, has the undesirable effect of eroding the capital base of MFIs and threatening their continued existence. The main research problem is that MFIs are faced with borrower default that threaten their operational sustainability. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the effect of group characteristics on the probability of borrower default. The characteristics of interest are: the age and gender of the borrower, group size, <b>loan</b> amount, <b>instalment</b> size, <b>loan</b> duration, loan cycle, location of group (rural or urban), business experience of the borrower, business savings, business assets, record of loan centre meeting attendance, family relations in a group and intra-group business risk correlation. The importance of this understanding will practically assist MFIs with insights regarding which factors to eliminate and which to enhance in the design of the groups to which they lend. The probit regression model was used on secondary data from a loan programme at a large South African MFI. The key findings of the study indicate that probability of default decreases with larger groups, more female borrowers in a group and larger borrower savings. We also found that probability of default increases with larger loan [...] ...|$|R
40|$|MBA - WBSIn South Africa, {{there is}} {{currently}} little research available on mortgage default and the determinants of default. The purpose {{of this research was}} to evaluate and distinguish between mortgage specific factors (including borrower and loan characteristics), driving mortgage default patterns in South Africa. This study intended to provide guidance to the South African banking industry (i. e. banking institutions), the South African Reserve Bank (policy maker and regulator), and the broader South African population in general. In addition, {{the results of the study}} can be utilised by banking institutions as inputs into their origination scorecard, policy rules and risk-based pricing models. Due to the sensitivities around financial institution’s data in South Africa, the sample used for this study was all current (on book) mortgage loans from an anonymous (single) financial institution in South Africa. Also, due to the practical availability of data, the sample period covered all current loans from said financial institution from August 2006 to December 2008, with information covering each loans default or non-default status during that time period. Based on the review of the literature surrounding mortgage defaults, five hypotheses were formulated. Only 1 of the 5 variables was found to be a good differentiator of mortgage default in South Africa. Current Loan-To-Value (LTV) was found to be the most critical and by far the largest contributor to the model’s ability to differentiate defaults. It was found that the higher the Current LTV, the more likely those borrowers would default. This finding is in line with conventional wisdom in the mortgage industry, in that loan-to-value ratios are positively correlated with mortgage default. The Age of the mortgage (i. e. account age in months since <b>loan</b> origination), <b>Instalment</b> to Income (ITI), Borrower age (years), Borrower Income and Balance Outstanding were found to be irrelevant in contributing to the model’s ability to differentiate mortgage defaults. Also, Balance (Loan) Outstanding was found to be the variable having the least impact on the model’s ability to differentiate iii mortgage defaults. In summary, given that Current LTV (loan characteristic), was found to be the only suitable variable in differentiating mortgage defaults, the conclusion is that only “Loan” characteristics (i. e. Loan to value) impact on mortgage defaults in South Africa. Furthermore, it is the “equity” theory that describes mortgage defaults, and not the “ability to pay” theory of defaul...|$|R
40|$|Business {{demand for}} short- and longterm credit and {{consumer}} demand for <b>instalment</b> <b>loans</b> have been smaller {{in the past}} 12 months than in other recent years. The Federal Government has borrowed slightly less on balance {{in the past year}} than in the preceding year, but will need to increase its borrowing substantially in the next six months. Long-term borrowing by State and local governments, on the other hand, has been in record volume, and lending on real estate mortgages has remained large. Indications are that credit demand in these areas will continue strong during the remainder of 1954. Commercial banks, with reserves adequate for further credit expansion but with a reduced demand for loans, increased their investments in Federal, State and local government, and corporate securities over the 12 -month period ending June 30, 1954. They were also more active in lending to dealers in securities and continued to add to their holdings of real estate loans. As a result, commercial bank credit increased substantially. Demand deposit and currency holdings of businesses and individuals have increased slightly since mid- 1953. Time deposits have continued to grow. United States Government deposits at commercial banks have risen, after a decline in the previous year. Availability to member banks of reserve funds for lending and investing has increased substantially and steadily over the past year. Member bank borrowing from the Reserve Banks has declined to nominal levels and excess reserves have increased somewhat. Reserves have been made available by the Federal Reserve through open market operations as well as by reductions in reserve requirements in July 1953 an...|$|R
