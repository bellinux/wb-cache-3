40|$|The {{influence}} of an intermittent <b>lighting</b> <b>programme</b> during the 12 h {{of the dark}} period on the incidence of ascites and on metabolic parameters of broiler chickens was examined. A group of 336 1 -day-old male broiler chickens mere randomly allocated to two open rooms At 5 days of age, an intermittent lighting schedule of 3 h of dark alternating with 1 h of light was introduced during the night in one room, while in the second room the schedule consisted of 23 h of light alternating with 1 h of dark. One-half of the birds in each room were fed a diet supplemented with 1. 5 ppm 3, 3 ', 5 -triiodothyronine (T- 3), while the other half received a control diet. Mortality associated with ascites was significantly higher in birds fed the T- 3 -supplemented diet, but was significantly lower in birds in the room receiving the intermittent lighting schedule. The intermittent <b>lighting</b> <b>programme</b> was also associated with a temporary reduction in growth rate, packed cell volume and plasma T- 3 concentrations, suggesting reduced oxygen utilization. However, final body weights were not significantly affected by the <b>lighting</b> <b>programme.</b> It was concluded that imposing 12 h of intermittent lighting during scotoperiod reduces the incidence of ascite mortality. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{experiment}} was to study short term and long term effects of different lighting programmes on the sexual behaviour of rabbit does maintained without production for 18 weeks after their first weaning. Sixty INRA 0067 rabbit does were equally divided into three groups (groups 8, 816 and 16). Four days before the first insemination, they were placed into three identical rooms under a constant 16 L: 8 D <b>lighting</b> <b>programme.</b> The day following the first weaning, three different lighting programmes were applied. For does of groups 8 and 816, the <b>lighting</b> <b>programme</b> suddenly changed from 16 L: 8 D to 8 L: 16 D. Only for group 816, {{at the beginning of}} the 10 th week, a sudden change was applied from 8 L: 16 D to 16 L: 8 D. During the whole experiment, does of the control group were under a constant 16 L: 8 D light programme (group 16). The experiment lasted 18 weeks. For each group, the sexual behaviour of rabbit does was tested in the presence of a vasectomised buck. The tests were done two times a week for two weeks at different phases during the experiment. For each phase, the receptivity test was considered on day 0 (D 0) and 5 days (D 5), 7 days (D 7) or 12 days (D 12) days later.

40|$|Sexual {{maturity}} is delayed and egg {{numbers are}} reduced when broiler breeders are reared on long photoperiods. However, {{this is the}} recommended procedure for rearing spring-hatched birds in non-lightproof buildings. Research at the University of KwaZulu-Natal has suggested that this advice may be incorrect, and that precocity {{is not a problem}} in control-fed broiler breeders reared on increasing daylengths. This trial compared the responses of four broiler breeder genotypes to a typical <b>lighting</b> <b>programme</b> advocated for birds in lightproof housing with the provision of 14 -h photoperiods to 20 weeks and 16 h in lay. The long-day rearing resulted in a 26 -d delay in sexual maturation, seven fewer eggs to 60 weeks, a 2. 5 -g increase in egg weight, less efficient feed conversion, heavier body weights at sexual maturity and throughout the laying period, and a higher incidence of mortality. It is concluded, therefore, that broiler breeders should not be reared on long photoperiods, even when hatched in the spring and kept in non-lightproof facilities, because of the adverse consequences of a delay in the dissipation of photorefractoriness. ______________________________________________________________________________________...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{developed}} a flow-limited physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for residues of monensin in chickens and evaluated its predictive ability by comparing {{it with an}} external data set describing concentration decays {{after the end of}} treatment. One advantage of this model is that the values for most parameters (34 of 38) were taken directly from the literature or from field data (for growth and feed intake). Our model included growth (changes in body weight) to describe exposure throughout the life of the chicken. We carried out a local sensitivity analysis to evaluate the relative importance of model parameters on model outputs and revealed the predominant influence of 19 parameters (including three estimated ones) : seven pharmacokinetic parameters, five physiological parameters and seven animal performance parameters. Our model estimated the relative bioavailability of monensin as feed additive at 3. 9 %, which is even lower than the absolute bioavailability in solution (29. 91 %). Our model can be used for extrapolations of farming conditions, such as monensin supplementation or building <b>lighting</b> <b>programme</b> (which may have a significant impact for short half-life molecules such as monensin).

40|$|In each year, {{electricity}} distribution expands through various requirements such as state sponsored rural electrification schemes and other interventions, connecting more consumers {{to the national}} grid, means the demand growth {{at the end of}} each year. The main challenge facing the CEB will be the rising price of oil and the generation capacity shortage. Generation capacity additions are required every year to keep pace with the increasing demand. Unless cheaper solutions are developed to meet this electricity demand, the financial burden of fuel oil based power generation will further strangle the government owned CEB. Importance of demand side management strategies have rapidly grown in the context of rising oil prices as well as extensive delays in implementing low cost electricity generation projects. Especially as a developing country, saving of energy has much more advantages. This report proposes to maximize the usage of existing capacity by introducing a sustainable <b>lighting</b> <b>programme</b> to popularize the use of efficient lighting devices among the consumers as energy development, which will offset the adverse impacts. The most economically effective method to achieve this goal is to introduce compact fluorescent lights among the consumers. That is because while a regular (incandescent) light bulb uses heat to produce light, a fluorescent bulb creates light using an entirely different method that is far more energy-efficient - in fact, 4 - 6 times more efficient. It can be easily implemented if a CFL bulb is priced as per the incandescent bulb price and distributed through CEB depot / offices...|$|E
40|$|A {{field study}} on {{lighting}} {{in the production}} of meat-type-chickens was conducted between April 2006 and February 2007. Part 1 comprised a survey on lighting practices in a substantial number of broiler farms in southern Germany (n = 187 broiler stables covering a total area of 276. 337 m²). It was carried out {{on the basis of a}} questionnaire adapted to broiler management. The focus of data collection was put on animal welfare issues of lighting. It was found that in conventional broiler farming closed buildings, with or without windows, are the most common kind of facility used. This applies to the number of farms as well as to the total area. A comparatively high proportion of stables from the early days of poultry farming in Germany shows that these agricultural buildings often remain in use unchanged for decades. Thus, once taken, decisions on lighting have practical consequences over the whole life-cycle of an agricultural building. The surroundings in closed stables are primarily conceived to accommodate the need of farm staff for work-efficiency and workplace-safety. Scientific findings on visual perception of poultry have not been implemented systematically in poultry farming, yet even though lighting constitutes a central management factor which can influence behaviour and health of the animals to a substantial degree. An exception is the fact that conventional fluorescent lights with a flicker frequency of 100 Hz, which poultry may perceive as discontinuous, have largely been eliminated from the farms we examined. Subsequently the lighting environments of characteristic types of broiler sheds were examined by means of spectrophotometry. Data were collected on illuminance, irradiance, UVA-irradiance and colour temperature in summer as well as in winter. Substantial differences were found between the two sampling dates, particularly where ultraviolet radiation was concerned. Additionally considerable differences between the type of building (with or without daylight) could be described. Taking into consideration the enlarged sensory facilities of birds (perception of ultraviolet radiation, flicker fusion frequency higher than 100 Hz), it can be concluded that the currently used methods for sampling light intensity, particularly the lux-unit, are suitable for poultry to a limited extent only. Part 2 was a study on the effects of two lighting programmes which differed exclusively in intensity (5 lx and 20 lx) from the 13 th day of the fattening period. The following parameters were collected and evaluated under field conditions: ►	Development of intraocular pressure ►	Development of eye measures ►	Behaviour and time-budget ►	Excretion of glucocorticoids (corticosterone) ►	Performance parameters Under 5 lx a modulation of intraocular pressure was observed. Moreover all eye measures were larger under 5 lx than under 20 lx. A biological relevance of these differences, which were very slight, can be denied with a high certainty. The animals kept under 20 lx showed phases of higher activity and more explorative and comfort behaviour than the group raised under 5 lx. These results could be interpreted as a decrease in global activity due to the low light intensity. The <b>lighting</b> <b>programme</b> with an intensity of 5 lx resulted in a tendency for a higher excretion of fecal corticosterone, which was significant on day 35 only. This could be interpreted as a direct influence of dark surroundings on glucocorticoid metabolism. Bright lighting (20 lx) increased the risk for necrotic dermatitis (inflammatory process) by a factor of more than three. A prolonged fattening time of 37 - 39 days predisposed the animals to the development of necrotic dermatitis as well. Pododermatitis score was better under dim lighting. Further effects of lighting on production parameters could not be found. Taken together, these results give strong hints that a decrease of light intensity to approximately 5 lx at the beginning of the third week of a production cycle may constitute a tool to improve performance and prevent skin damage. Nonetheless these low light intensities could be stressful for the animals. These results were collected under field conditions and under certain restrictions. More research under controlled conditions remains therefore to be done...|$|E

40|$|Recently, intense broiler {{selection}} for rate {{of body weight}} gain and improved feed conversion has been an area of focus for poultry breeders. Modern broilers achieve slaughtering age at 60 % less time than 40 years ago. However, this increased growth rate has resulted in complications that ultimately resulted in metabolic diseases. Pulmonary hypertension syndrome (also known as "ascites") is a very common disease that is caused by an increased metabolic rate due to increased growth rate. Other factors such as incubation conditions, nutrition, <b>lighting</b> <b>programme,</b> altitude and temperature had proven to exacerbate this metabolic disease. Ascites syndrome is characterised by the accumulation of abdominal fluid, liver damage, pericardial effusion and inflammation of the right ventricle of the heart. Zn is responsible for > 300 enzyme processes and is also required for the synthesis of metallothionine {{that is responsible for}} antioxidant activity. Mn also operates as a cofactor for superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes that provide oxidative stress resistance through formation of non-proteinaceous manganese-based antioxidants. Five thousand eight hundred and eight (5808) eggs from parent stock (Ross 308) were incubated at either normal (37. 5 - 38. 0 °C) or high (38. 5 - 39. 0 °C) temperatures. Chicks from both these incubation temperatures were randomly allocated to one of four dietary treatments to create a 4 x 2 factorial design with 8 treatments replicated in 12 pens each. One thousand eight hundred and twenty four (1824) Ross 308 feather sexed males were placed in a 96 -pen broiler facility, with each pen (1. 5 m× 1. 5 m) containing 19 chicks. Four dietary treatments were fed ad libitum from day-old until 42 days of age. Treatment 1 contained 80 mg/kg of ZnSO 4 and 80 mg/kg of MnSO 4 while Treatment 2 contained 120 mg/kg of each. Treatment 3 contained 80 mg/kg of ZnSO 4 and 80 mg/kg MnSO 4 and 40 mg/kg Availa Zn/Mn (Zinpro Corporation, Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA). Finally, Treatment 4 contained 40 mg/kg of ZnSO 4 and 40 mg/kg of MnSO 4 and 80 mg/kg Availa Zn/Mn. Weekly body weights, feed intake and feed conversion ratio (RCR) were recorded per pen. Daily mortalities were collected, recorded and dissected to determine if {{the cause of death was}} attributable to ascites syndrome. At 21 and 42 days of age, two birds per pen were sampled for haematocrit values and necropsied for right ventricle to total ventricle weight (RV/TV) ratios, and ascites syndrome related symptoms. Birds incubated at normal temperature generally performed better than the birds that were incubated at high temperatures. Chicks that were incubated at normal temperatures showed lower mortalities (general and ascites related) and greater carcass weights at the end of the growing period (42 days of age). However, the RV/TV ratios were not significantly different between incubation treatments at all ages. Treatment 1 contained 80 mg/kg inorganic Zn/Mn (sulphates), which represented the lower end inclusion rate of inorganic zinc in poultry diets as an industry standard. Treatment 2 contained 120 mg/kg inorganic Zn/Mn that represented an upper end inclusion rate of inorganic zinc in commercial poultry diets and to observe the level response between Treatment 1 and 2. Treatment 3 contained 80 mg/kg inorganic Zn/Mn and 40 mg/kg organic Zn/Mn, which is the commercial optimum replacement rate of inorganic Zn with organic Zn based on literature to observe performance benefits from organic Zn and Mn. Treatment 4 contained 40 mg/kg Inorganic Zn/Mn and 80 mg/kg organic Zn/Mn, this was to observe any further performance benefits from increasing organic Zn/Mn relative to inorganic Zn/Mn in the diet. Treatment 3 and 4 (Availa Zn and Mn) exhibited improved body weight gain, less mortality (general and ascites related), improved carcass weights, and better flock uniformity at 42 days of age as compared to chicks from Treatment 1 and 2 (ZnSO 4 and MnSO 4) at the same inclusion levels. The ascites syndrome incidence was also lower in Treatment 3 and 4 as compared to Treatment 3 and 4. These research findings suggest that high incubation temperatures are detrimental to broiler health and welfare and may ultimately increase the incidence of ascites syndrome. However, 40 % replacement of inorganic Zn and Mn with their organic sources alleviated ascites incidence and improved overall broiler performance.
