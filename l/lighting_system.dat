5|$|The <b>lighting</b> <b>system</b> is {{programmed}} to darken the set as the contestant progresses {{further into the}} game. There are also spotlights situated {{at the bottom of}} the set area that zoom down on the contestant when they answer a major question; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such spotlights, oil is vaporized, creating a haze effect. Media scholar Dr. Robert Thompson, a professor at Syracuse University, stated that the show's <b>lighting</b> <b>system</b> made the contestant feel as though they were outside of prison when an escape was in progress.|$|E
5|$|Each of Hollywood Dream's 5 trains carry 36 {{riders in}} nine coaches, each having {{a row of}} four seats. All trains have an {{on-board}} audio and <b>lighting</b> <b>system,</b> with each seat having a headrest stereo sound system capable of playing one of five songs selected by the rider with a control panel inserted into the seat's restraining lap bar. The on-board audio and <b>lighting</b> <b>system</b> animates LED lights that are built into the trains' sides and front riderless pilot coach. The lighting program varies as the train moves, with different animations for different track sections and the station.

40|$|Ambient systems provide {{information}} in the periphery of a user’s attention. Their aim is to present information as unobtrusively as possible to avoid interrupting primary tasks (e. g. writing or reading). In recent years, light {{has been used to}} create ambient systems to display information. Examples of ambient <b>light</b> <b>systems</b> range from simple notification systems such as displaying messages or calendar event reminders, to more complex systems such as focusing on conveying information regarding health activity tracking. However, for ambient <b>light</b> <b>systems,</b> there is a broad design space that lacks guidelines on when to make use of light displays and how to design them. In this paper we provide a systematic overview of existing ambient <b>light</b> <b>systems</b> over four identified information classes derived from 72 existing ambient <b>light</b> <b>systems.</b> The most prominent encoding parameters among the surveyed ambient <b>light</b> <b>systems</b> are color, brightness, and their combination. By analyzing existing ambient <b>light</b> <b>systems,</b> we provide a first step towards developing guidelines for designing future ambient <b>light</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the implementation of dynamic <b>lighting</b> <b>systems</b> from the perspective of stakeholders and the performance of the technology. Therefore, a questionnaire survey was conducted with the management and care professionals of six {{care facilities}}. Moreover, light measurements were conducted in order to describe the exposure of residents to lighting.

The majority of care professionals were not aware of the reasons why dynamic <b>lighting</b> <b>systems</b> were installed. Despite positive subjective ratings of the dynamic <b>lighting</b> <b>systems,</b> no data were collected by the organizations to evaluate the effectiveness of the lighting. Although the care professionals stated that they did not see any large positive effects of the dynamic <b>lighting</b> <b>systems</b> on the residents and their own work situation, the majority appreciated the dynamic <b>lighting</b> <b>systems</b> more than the old situation. The light values measured in the care facilities did not exceed the minimum threshold values reported in the literature.

Experimentally, the diffused lighting reduced the ships' visibility by up to 70%, but at sea the electrical equipment proved too delicate, and frequently malfunctioned. Worse, the system was slow to respond to changes in background lighting, and the Canadian Navy considered the lighting too green.|$|E

Increase of energy price {{and a high}} proportion of electric lighting energy consumption in buildings due to defects in designing and maintenance led to desirable lighting to be reduced. One of our challenges in providing health and quality of lighting is lack of economic justification of projects. Furthermore, evaluating the <b>lighting</b> <b>systems</b> is very important to improve these <b>systems</b> and maintaining <b>lighting</b> quality. In this study the performance of the various <b>lighting</b> <b>systems</b> has been evaluated.

40|$|This {{research}} {{introduces the}} concept of a bus hold <b>light</b> <b>system</b> that is based on headways of arriving trains in an effort to improve rail-to-bus transfer connectivity through a simple-to-implement, low-cost dispatching strategy. An analytical model and a simulation model are developed to analyze the impacts of the proposed headway-based hold <b>light</b> <b>system</b> on total passenger wait time and other relevant measures of transfer performance. The application of the two models to the cases of Alewife and Wellington Stations in the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) system and to 79 Street Station in the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) system shows that the headway-based hold <b>light</b> <b>system</b> can produce substantial passenger wait time savings if implemented in an appropriate setting. Throughout these analyses, the sensitivity of the headway-based hold <b>light</b> <b>system</b> to various factors is analyzed, and the results obtained with the headway-based hold <b>light</b> <b>system</b> are compared with those obtained from the application of other bus dispatching strategies, most notably the strategy of holding each departing bus for passengers transferring from the next train arrival. (cont.) Based on the case study results and sensitivity analyses, a set of guidelines for the implementation of headway-based hold <b>light</b> <b>systems</b> is proposed. In. the comparison of the headway-based hold <b>light</b> <b>system</b> and the hold-all-buses strategy, it is shown that the headway-based hold <b>light</b> <b>system</b> is superior when a large number of downstream boardings occur, due to its tendency to avoid holding bus trips with very few transferring passengers but many downstream passengers. by Andrew T.
