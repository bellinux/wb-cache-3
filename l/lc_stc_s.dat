40|$|Based on {{electronic}} structure calculations and theoretical analysis, we predict the (111) thin {{films of the}} SnTe class of three-dimensional (3 D) topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) realize the quantum spin Hall phase {{in a wide range}} of thicknesses. The nontrivial topology originates from the intersurface coupling of the topological surface states of TCIs in the 3 D limit. The intersurface coupling changes sign and gives rise to topological phase transitions as a function of film thickness. Furthermore, this coupling can be strongly affected by an external electric field, hence the quantum spin Hall phase can be effectively tuned under the experimentally accessible electric field.

When the valence changed, older but not younger children recovered both the characters' beliefs and desires. In contrast, adults jointly recovered agents' beliefs and desires in all conditions.

Within this framework, we predict that when people believe a loved one cares about a behavior {{more than they do}} themselves, the moral imperative to care about the loved one's interests will raise the value of that behavior, such that people {{will be more likely to}} infer that third parties will see the behavior as wrong (Experiment 1) and the behavior itself as more morally important (Experiment 2) than when the same behaviors are considered outside the context of a caring relationship.

At high magnetic fields, increased field penetration through the surface states is observed, strongly suggestive of the opening of a surface state band gap due to broken time-reversal symmetry.

While monolayer h-BN has been synthesized on Pt and Cu foil using chemical vapour deposition (CVD), multilayer h-BN is still absent. Here we use Fe foil and synthesize large-area multilayer h-BN film by CVD with a borazine precursor. These films reveal strong cathodoluminescence and high mechanical strength (Young’s modulus: 1. 16 ± 0. 1 [*]TPa), reminiscent of formation of high-quality h-BN.

MethodsTotal RNA was isolated from the cartilaginous layer of osteophytes and from intact articular cartilage from knee joints of 15 adult human donors and subjected to cDNA microarray analysis. The differential expression of relevant genes between these two cartilaginous tissues was additionally validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and by immunohistochemistry. ResultsAmong 47, 000 screened transcripts, 600 transcripts were differentially expressed between osteophytic and articular chondrocytes. Osteophytic chondrocytes were characterized by increased expression of genes involved in the endochondral ossification process [bone gamma-carboxyglutamate protein/osteocalcin (BGLAP), bone morphogenetic protein- 8 B (BMP 8 B), collagen type I, alpha 2 (COL 1 A 2), sclerostin (SOST), growth arrest and DNA damage-induced gene 45 ß (GADD 45 ß), runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX 2) ], and genes encoding tissue remodeling enzymes [matrix metallopeptidase (MMP) 9, 13, hyaluronan synthase 1 (HAS 1) ]. Articular chondrocytes expressed increased transcript levels of antagonists and inhibitors of the BMP- and Wnt-signaling pathways [Gremlin- 1 (GREM 1), frizzled-related protein (FRZB), WNT 1 inducible signaling pathway protein- 3 (WISP 3) ], as well as factors that inhibit terminal chondrocyte differentiation and endochondral bone formation [parathyroid hormone-like hormone (PTHLH), sex-determining region Y-box 9 (SOX 9), stanniocalcin- 2 (<b>STC</b> 2), <b>S</b> 100 calcium binding protein A 1 (S 100 A 1), S 100 calcium binding protein B (S 100 B) ]. Immunohistochemistry of tissue sections for GREM 1 and BGLAP, the two most prominent differentially expressed genes, confirmed selective detection of GREM 1 in articular chondrocytes and that of BGLAP in osteophytic chondrocytes and bone. ConclusionsOsteophytic and articular chondrocytes significantly differ in their gene expression pattern. In articular cartilage, a prominent expression of antagonists inhibiting the BMP- and Wnt-pathway may serve to lock and stabilize the permanent chondrocyte phenotype and thus prevent their terminal differentiation. In contrast, osteophytic chondrocytes express genes with roles in the endochondral ossification process, which may account for their transient phenotype...|$|R
40|$|Interactions {{between two}} {{excitons}} {{can result in}} the formation of bound quasiparticles, known as biexcitons. Their properties are determined by the constituent excitons, with orbital and spin states resembling those of atoms. Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) present a unique system where excitons acquire a new degree of freedom, the valley pseudospin, from which a novel intervalley biexciton can be created. These biexcitons comprise two excitons from different valleys, which are distinct from biexcitons in conventional semiconductors and have no direct analog in atomic and molecular systems. However, their valley properties are not accessible to traditional transport and optical measurements. Here, we report the observation of intervalley biexcitons in the monolayer TMD MoS[subscript 2] using ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy. By applying broadband probe pulses with different helicities, we identify two species of intervalley biexcitons with large binding energies of 60 and 40  meV. In addition, we also reveal effects beyond biexcitonic pairwise interactions in which the exciton energy redshifts at increasing exciton densities, indicating the presence of many-body interactions among them.

40|$|This {{laboratory}} study describes the sediment patterns formed in a sand bed around circular patches of rigid vertical cylinders, representing {{a patch of}} reedy emergent vegetation. The patch diameter was {{much smaller than the}} channel width. Two patch densities (solid volume fraction 3 % and 10 %) and two patch diameters (22 and 10 cm) were considered. For flows above the threshold of sediment motion, patterns of sediment erosion and deposition were observed around and within the patch. Scouring within the patch was positively correlated with turbulent kinetic energy in the patch. For sparse patches, sediment scoured from within the patch was mostly deposited within one patch diameter downstream of the patch. For dense patches, which experience greater flow diversion, sediment scoured from the patch was carried farther downstream before deposition along the patch centerline. Differences between the sparse and dense patch patterns of deposition are explained in the context of flow diversion and wake structure, which are related to a nondimensional flow blockage parameter. While sediment was redistributed near the patch, observations suggest that net deposition was not recorded at the reach scale.

40|$|We {{show that}} the surface dispersions of topological semimetals map to {{helicoidal}} structures, where the bulk nodal points project to the branch points of the helicoids whose equal-energy contours are Fermi arcs. This mapping is demonstrated in the recently discovered Weyl semimetals and leads us to predict new types of topological semimetals, whose surface states are represented by double- and quad-helicoid surfaces. Each helicoid or multi-helicoid is shown to be the non-compact Riemann surface representing a multi-valued holomorphic function (generating function). The intersection of multiple helicoids, or the branch cut of the generating function, appears on high-symmetry lines in the surface Brillouin zone, where surface states are guaranteed to be doubly degenerate by a glide reflection symmetry.

However, much less is known about when, and under what conditions, children expect other agents to change their minds. Here, inspired by formal ideal observer models of learning, we investigate children's expectations of the dynamics that underlie third parties' belief revision. We introduce an agent who has prior beliefs about {{the location of a}} population of toys and then observes evidence that, from an ideal observer perspective, either does, or does not justify revising those beliefs. We show that children's inferences on behalf of third parties are consistent with the ideal observer perspective, but not with a number of alternative possibilities, including that children expect other agents to be influenced only by their prior beliefs, only by the sampling process, or only by the observed data. Rather, children integrate all three factors in determining how and when agents will update their beliefs from evidence. National Science Foundation (U. S.).

Here we explore the possibility that high interstitial pressure in tumors and the resultant net filtration pressure gradient that would induce flow from the interstitium into the venous circulation or lymphatics could also be an important mechanical regulator of angiogenesis. The objective {{of this study was}} to test the hypothesis that basal-to-apical (B–A) transendothelial flow promotes angiogenesis and to investigate potential mechanisms. Macro- and microvascular endothelial monolayers were cultured on type I collagen gels in a microfluidic cell culture device and subjected to apical-to-basal (A–B) and B–A transendothelial flows. Samples were perfusion fixed and analyzed for morphological responses, localization and degree of phosphorylation of certain signaling proteins. Application of B–A, but not A–B flow, to cultured endothelial monolayers was found to promote capillary morphogenesis and resulted in distinct localization patterns of VE-cadherin and increased FAK phosphorylation. These results suggest that B–A flow triggers the transition of vascular endothelial cells from a quiescent to invasive phenotype and that the flow-mediated response involves signaling at cell–cell and cell–matrix interfaces. These results support the hypothesis that transendothelial pressure gradients resulting in B–A flow promotes sprouting angiogenesis and are consistent with early observations that tumor angiogenesis occurs from the venous side of the circulation.

The spin currents are generated {{in a thin}} layer of permalloy (Py) by two different processes, the spin pumping effect (SPE) and the spin Seebeck effect (SSE). In the first, we use microwave-driven ferromagnetic resonance of the Py film to generate a SPE spin current that is injected into the TI (Bi[subscript 0. 22]Sb[subscript 0. 78]) [subscript 2]Te[subscript 3] layer in direct contact with Py. In the second, we use the SSE in the longitudinal configuration in Py without contamination by the anomalous Nernst effect, which was made possible with a thin NiO layer between the Py and (Bi[subscript 0. 22]Sb[subscript 0. 78]) [subscript 2]Te[subscript 3] layers. The spin-to-charge current conversion is dominated by the TI surface states and is attributed to the inverse Edelstein effect (IEE), which is made possible by the spin-momentum locking in the electron Fermi contours due to the Rashba field.

While neurons in these areas appear to have different tuning (Freiwald and Tsao, 2010; Issa and DiCarlo, 2012), exactly what types of information and, consequently, which visual behaviors neural populations within each face area can support, is unknown. Here we use population decoding to better characterize three of these face patches (ML/MF, AL, and AM). We show that neural activity in all patches contains information that discriminates between the broad categories of face and nonface objects, individual faces, and nonface stimuli. Information is present in both high and lower firing rate regimes. However, {{there were significant differences}} between the patches, with the most anterior patch showing relatively weaker representation of nonface stimuli. Additionally, we find that pose-invariant face identity information increases as one moves to more anterior patches, while information about the orientation of the head decreases. Finally, we show that all the information we can extract from the population is present in patterns of activity across neurons, and there is relatively little information in the total activity of the population. These findings give new insight into the representations constructed by the face patch system and how they are successively transformed.

40|$|Discovering {{the visual}} {{features}} and representations {{used by the}} brain to recognize objects is a central problem {{in the study of}} vision. Recently, neural network models of visual object recognition, including biological and deep network models, have shown remarkable progress and have begun to rival human performance in some challenging tasks. These models are trained on image examples and learn to extract features and representations and to use them for categorization. It remains unclear, however, whether the representations and learning processes discovered by current models are similar to those used by the human visual system. Here we show, by introducing and using minimal recognizable images, that the human visual system uses features and processes that are not used by current models and that are critical for recognition. We found by psychophysical studies that at the level of minimal recognizable images a minute change in the image can have a drastic effect on recognition, thus identifying features that are critical for the task. Simulations then showed that current models cannot explain this sensitivity to precise feature configurations and, more generally, do not learn to recognize minimal images at a human level. The role of the features shown here is revealed uniquely at the minimal level, where the contribution of each feature is essential. A full understanding of the learning and use of such features will extend our understanding of visual recognition and its cortical mechanisms and will enhance the capacity of computational models to learn from visual experience and to deal with recognition and detailed image interpretation.

However, recent papers {{on a new}} approach called Meta-Interpretive Learning have demonstrated that both predicate invention and learning recursive predicates can be efficiently implemented for various fragments of definite clause logic using a form of abduction within a meta-interpreter. This paper explores the effect of bias reformulation produced by Meta-Interpretive Learning {{on a series of}} Program Induction tasks involving string transformations. These tasks have real-world applications in the use of spreadsheet technology. The existing implementation of program induction in Microsoft's FlashFill (part of Excel 2013) already has strong performance on this problem, and performs one-shot learning, in which a simple transformation program is generated from a single example instance and applied to the remainder of the column in a spreadsheet. However, no existing technique has been demonstrated to improve learning performance over a series of tasks in the way humans do. In this paper we show how a functional variant of the recently developed MetagolD system can be applied to this task. In experiments we study a regime of layered bias reformulation in which size-bounds of hypotheses are successively relaxed in each layer and learned programs re-use invented predicates from previous layers. Results indicate that this approach leads to consistent speed increases in learning, more compact definitions and consistently higher predictive accuracy over successive layers. Comparison to both FlashFill and human performance indicates that the new system, MetagolDF, has performance approaching the skill level of both an existing commercial system and that of humans on one-shot learning over the same tasks. The induced programs are relatively easily read and understood by a human programmer.

First, the three previously reported color-biased regions (located within a band running posterior–anterior along the VVP, present in most of our subjects) were sandwiched between face-selective cortex and place-selective cortex, forming parallel bands of face, color, and place selectivity that tracked the fusiform gyrus/collateral sulcus. Second, the posterior color-biased regions showed little or no selectivity for object shape or for particular stimulus categories and showed no interaction of color preference with stimulus category, suggesting that they code color independently of shape or stimulus category; moreover, the shape-biased lateral occipital region showed no significant color bias. These observations mirror results in macaque inferior temporal cortex (Lafer-Sousa and Conway, 2013), and taken together, these results suggest a homology in which the entire tripartite face/color/place system of primates migrated onto the ventral surface in humans over the course of evolution.
