40|$|In phase I studies, <b>lobaplatin</b> showed {{activity}} in ovarian cancer patients pretreated with platinum. A phase II trial with <b>lobaplatin</b> {{was performed in}} patients with refractory or relapsed ovarian cancer to define activity and pharmacokinetics. Twenty-two patients were treated with <b>lobaplatin</b> administered as an intravenous bolus every 4 weeks. Dependent on creatinine clearance (CRCL) patients received 30 or 50 mg m- 2 <b>lobaplatin</b> as the starting dose. Twenty-two patients received 78 courses (median 3, range 1 - 6). In eight patients total platinum (TPt) in plasma and urine, free platinum (FPt) in plasma ultrafiltrate (both measured by atomic absorption spectrometry) and <b>lobaplatin</b> in plasma ultrafiltrate measured (by high-performance liquid chromatography) were measured. Toxicity was confined to mild nausea and vomiting, mild leucocytopenia (WHO grade 3 in 18 % of the courses), and renal function-related thrombocytopenia (WHO grade 3 / 4 in 53 % of the courses). A correlation was found between CRCL and reduction in platelet count (r = - 0. 77; P < 0. 01). No renal toxicity was encountered. Five of 21 evaluable patients (24 %) achieved a response (four complete remissions and one partial remission). Remissions occurred mainly in patients who relapsed more than 6 months after primary treatment. The median survival from start of <b>lobaplatin</b> treatment was 8 months. The mean areas under the curve (AUCs) were 4. 2 +/- 0. 5, 3. 0 +/- 0. 6, and 3. 2 +/- 1. 1 h mgl- 1 for TPt, FPt and <b>lobaplatin</b> respectively. The free platinum fraction (FPt/TPt) was initially very high, indicating low protein binding. FPt was essentially present as intact <b>lobaplatin.</b> Four hours after infusion 54 +/- 5 % and 24 h after infusion 74 +/- 3 % of the <b>lobaplatin</b> dose was excreted in the urine. In conclusion, <b>lobaplatin</b> is a platinum compound with anti-tumour {{activity in}} patients with relapsed ovarian cancer, especially in those who have platinum-sensitive tumours. The main toxicity of <b>lobaplatin</b> is thrombocytopenia and its dose should be corrected according to renal function...|$|E
40|$|The {{cytotoxicity}} of cisplatin and cisplatin-DNA adduct {{formation in}} vitro and in vivo is clearly enhanced by hyperthermia. We investigated whether cytotoxicity and platinum-DNA adduct formation of two promising new third-generation platinum derivatives, <b>lobaplatin</b> [1, 2 -diamminomethylcyclobutane platinum(II) lactate] and oxaliplatin [oxalato- 1, 2 -diaminocyclohexane platinum(II) ], are also enhanced by hyperthermia. Cisplatin {{was used for}} comparison. SW 1573 cells were incubated with cisplatin, <b>lobaplatin</b> or oxaliplatin at different concentrations for 1 h at 37 degrees, 41 degrees and 43 degrees C. The reproductive capacity of cells was determined by cloning experiments. Immunocytochemical detection of platinum-DNA adducts was performed with the rabbit antiserum NKI-A 59. At 37 degrees C, cisplatin was the most cytotoxic, followed by oxaliplatin and <b>lobaplatin.</b> Hyperthermia clearly enhanced the cytotoxicity of cisplatin, <b>lobaplatin</b> and oxaliplatin. There was no further increase in cytotoxicity at 43 degrees C compared to 41 degrees C for cisplatin and oxaliplatin. A further increase in cytotoxicity at 43 degrees C was observed for <b>lobaplatin.</b> At 43 degrees C thermal enhancement was higher for <b>lobaplatin</b> than for oxaliplatin, with the reverse pattern at 41 degrees C. For both drugs, thermal enhancement of cytotoxicity was lower than observed for cisplatin. Immunocytochemical detection of platinum-DNA adducts was feasible for all the drugs. Adduct formation was enhanced at 43 degrees C for cisplatin, <b>lobaplatin</b> and oxaliplatin with a relative increase of 410 %, 170 % and 180 %. These results seem to confirm that an increase in platinum-DNA adduct formation {{is involved in the}} in vitro thermal enhancement of cytotoxicity.

40|$|Abstract Background Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) {{still is}} a big burden for China. In recent years, the third-generation platinum compounds have been proposed as potential active agents for HCC. However, more experimental and clinical data are warranted to support the proposal. In the present study, the effect of <b>lobaplatin</b> was assessed in five HCC cell lines and the underlying molecular mechanisms in terms of cell cycle kinetics were explored. Methods Cytotoxicity of <b>lobaplatin</b> to human HCC cell lines was examined using MTT cell proliferation assay. Cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry. Expression of cell cycle-regulated genes was examined at both the mRNA (RT-PCR) and protein (Western blot) levels. The phosphorylation status of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and retinoblastoma (Rb) protein was also examined using Western blot analysis. Results <b>Lobaplatin</b> inhibited proliferation of human HCC cells in a dose-dependent manner. For the most sensitive SMMC- 7721 cells, <b>lobaplatin</b> arrested cell cycle progression in G 1 and G 2 /M phases time-dependently which might {{be associated with the}} down-regulation of cyclin B, CDK 1, CDC 25 C, phosphorylated CDK 1 (pCDK 1), pCDK 4, Rb, E 2 F, and pRb, and the up-regulation of p 53, p 21, and p 27.

Each patient received a single dose level, the total dose of <b>lobaplatin</b> ranged from 30 to 60 mg/m 2 / 72 h every 4 weeks. Eleven patients enroled {{in this study and}} received a total of 30 courses of <b>lobaplatin</b> (median 2; range 1 - 6). Thrombo-cytopenia was the dose-limiting toxicity, it reached WHO grade III in three out of six patients at 45 mg/m 2 / 72 h, and WHO grade IV in two out of two patients at 60 mg/m 2 / 72 h. Leucocytopenia was mild, as was nausea and vomiting. Phlebitis at the infusion site was found in three patients. During this trial there were no signs of renal, neuro- or ototoxicity. One patient with ovarian cancer, pretreated with three different platinum complexes, achieved a partial response now lasting for longer than 6 months.

Cisplatin {{is also the most}} weakly bound of drugs considered here, and heptaplatin the most strongly bound. Differences in binding appear to be due to changes in the pattern of non-covalent interactions between drug and DNA, especially hydrogen bonding to oxygen in guanine and phosphate groups.

Resistance factors for both CDDP-resistant cell lines were determined after continuous incubation (4 days) with CDDP. Continuous incubation with the other studied platinum drugs revealed complete cross-resistance for carboplatin (CBDCA) and zeniplatin but less for enloplatin (ENLO) and iproplatin in both models. Tetraplatin and <b>lobaplatin</b> showed, respectively, partial and complete cross-resistance in GLC 4 /CDDP but no cross-resistance in Tera-CP. GSH level, but not glutathione S-transferase activity, of the 4 cell lines correlated with platinum drug concentrations inhibiting cell survival by 50 % after continuous incubation (r = 0. 86, P < 0. 05). GSH depletion by DL-buthionine-SR-sulfoximine (BSO) increased sensitivity, as measured after a 4 -h exposure to the drugs, of GLC 4 /CDDP for CDDP 2. 0 -fold, for CBDCA 1. 7 -fold, for zeniplatin 1. 7 -fold, and almost {{to the level of}} the sensitive GLC 4 for ENLO, whereas no effect was observed for <b>lobaplatin</b> and the Pt(IV) compounds iproplatin and tetraplatin. BSO-modulating effect was higher in the sensitive GLC 4 line for most compounds; therefore reduction of resistance could be achieved only for CDDP and ENLO. In contrast to GLC 4, no modulation occurred in Tera. In Tera-CP BSO increased sensitivity for CDDP 1. 5 -fold, for CBDCA 1. 9 -fold, and for zeniplatin 1. 2 -fold; no effect was observed for ENLO, <b>lobaplatin,</b> and the Pt(IV) compounds. Reduction of CDDP resistance by BSO was known to occur with identical cellular platinum levels and higher Pt-DNA binding in GLC 4 /CCDP. However, pretreatment with BSO followed by 4 h ENLO incubation increased cellular platinum levels in both GLC 4 and GLC 4 /CDDP while Pt-DNA binding remained unchanged. In conclusion, GSH reflected sensitivity to platinum-containing drugs.

40|$|A {{series of}} density {{functional}} theory (DFT) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations {{are used to}} investigate the binding of platinum and ruthenium anticancer drugs to DNA. The qualitative and quantitative features of Becke's half-and-half (BHandH) functional for calculating geometries, binding energies and harmonic frequencies of non- covalently bound systems are tested and the intermolecular interactions are characterised and quantified using the QTAIM electron densities. Application of this DFT-QTAIM approach to complexes of the type (n 6 -arene) Ru(en) (nucleobase) 2 + shows a clear preference for binding at guanine over any other base both in gas phase and in aqueous solution, a trend explained {{on the basis of}} QTAIM and molecular orbital data. Key parameters of the QM/MM methodology within the ONIOM scheme and efficient geometry optimisation strategies are examined for applications involving DNA oligonucleotides. Calculations on cis- Pt(NH 3) 2 2 + (cisplatin) bound to d(CpCpTpGpGpTpCpC). (GpGpApCpCpApGpG) reveal that proper consideration of the electrostatics between the QM an MM regions can lead to acceptable geometries, especially when explicit solvent molecules are present. This approach is used to explore the effects of methyl substitution on the binding of a series of Pt(en) 2 + (en: ethylenediamine) complexes to dinucleotides. Among the examined methyl derivatives, significant differences are observed for the variants whose en nitrogen atoms are multiply methylated. Binding energies are found to be in excellent correlation with in vitro cytotoxicity data expressed as -log(IC 5 o).

Three platinum complexes, cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin, are marketed for various oncological purposes.

30|$|In the 1960 s, Rosenberg {{and colleagues}} accidentally {{discovered}} the cytotoxicity of cisplatin (cis-Pt [NH 3] 2 Cl 2, Additional file 1 : Figure S 1 a), which showed high anticancer activity [1]. At {{the end of}} 1970 s, cisplatin became the first platinum anticancer drugs in clinic [2]. Then, it was widely used {{for the treatment of}} many malignancies, including testicular, ovarian, bladder, head and neck, small-cell, and non-small-cell lung cancers [3]. Dozens of cisplatin analogs, such as carboplatin, oxaliplatin, nedaplatin, and <b>lobaplatin,</b> were synthesized and used in some limited range [4]. However, the efficacies of cisplatin and its analogs were primarily restricted by their poor water solubility, toxicity, and cross-resistance [5]. The rapid development of nanotechnology had promoted the in-depth study of platinum anticancer drugs [6]. Cis-diamminediiodoplatinum (cis-DIDP) is now mainly used as the intermediate preparing cisplatin and other analogs [7]. With square planar structure, the cis-DIDP is similar to cisplatin, but chlorine ion (Cl−) is substituted by iodine ion (I−). According to the spectrochemical sequence of crystal field theory, cis-DIDP is more unstable than cisplatin. Therefore, in solution, I− is easier to leave than Cl−, so I− is more reactive than Cl−. In other words, in platinum complexes, I− is more readily being substituted than Cl− by solvent water molecules, which makes it possible for cis-DIDP to act as an anticancer reagent with better activity than cisplatin [8]. It is to be expected that cis-DIDP could directly act as an efficient anticancer reagent rather than as an intermediate. There might be some methods to improve the therapeutic indices of platinum anticancer drugs, i.e., the development of cancer-targeting formulations of platinum-containing drugs, including drug carriers such as polymer, long-circulating liposome, and polymeric micelle [9 – 11]. The development of controlled release drug carrier makes it possible for cis-DIDP to be applied in clinical.|$|E
