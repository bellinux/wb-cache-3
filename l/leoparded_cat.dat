30|$|Scat from <b>leopard</b> <b>cats</b> was {{differentiated}} from scat {{of other}} small carnivores {{in terms of}} the shape and size and/or the presence of species-specific tracks (Grassman et al. 2005). An average diameter of 1  cm for the scat of the <b>leopard</b> <b>cat</b> was used as a reference. Assuming that cannibalism did not occur (Grassman et al. 2005), another criterion for identifying <b>leopard</b> <b>cat</b> scat was the presence of hair ingested while auto-grooming. The diet of <b>leopard</b> <b>cats</b> was investigated via analysis of their scat. Scat was collected from Samcheok in 2006, Goheung in 2011, and Gwangju in 2011 in Korea (Table  1). The scat was placed in a fine mesh nylon stocking and washed to separate the contents. The contents were then sun-dried and stored in 70 % alcohol.|$|R

40|$|Background: Comparative phylogeography links {{historical}} population {{processes to}} current/ecological processes through congruent/incongruent patterns of genetic variation among species/lineages. Despite high biodiversity, India lacks a phylogeographic paradigm due to limited comparative studies. We compared the phylogenetic patterns of Indian populations of jungle cat (Felis chaus) and <b>leopard</b> <b>cat</b> (Prionailurus bengalensis). Given similarities in their distribution within India, evolutionary histories, body size and habits, congruent patterns of genetic variation were expected. Methodology/Principal Findings: We collected scats from various biogeographic zones in India and analyzed mtDNA from 55 jungle cats (460 bp NADH 5, 141 bp cytochrome b) and 40 <b>leopard</b> <b>cats</b> (362 bp NADH 5, 202 bp cytochrome b). Jungle cats revealed high genetic variation, relatively low population structure and demographic expansion around the mid-Pleistocene. In contrast, <b>leopard</b> <b>cats</b> revealed lower genetic variation and high population structure with a F ST of 0. 86 between North and South Indian populations. Niche-model analyses using two approaches (BIOCLIM and MaxEnt) support absence of <b>leopard</b> <b>cats</b> from Central India, indicating a climate associated barrier. We hypothesize that high summer temperatures limit <b>leopard</b> <b>cat</b> distribution {{and that a}} rise in temperature in the peninsular region of India during the LGM caused the split in <b>leopard</b> <b>cat</b> population in India. Conclusions/Significance: Our results indicate that ecological variables describing a species range can predict geneti...|$|R

40|$|A habitat {{model was}} {{developed}} to delineate potential habitat of the <b>leopard</b> <b>cat</b> (Prionailurus bengalensis) in a mountainous region of Kangwon Province, Korea. Between 1997 and 2005, 224 <b>leopard</b> <b>cat</b> presence sites were recorded in the province in the Nationwide Survey on Natural Environments. Fifty percent of the sites were used to develop a habitat model, and the remaining sites were {{used to test the}} model. Fourteen environmental variables related to topographic features, water resources, vegetation and human disturbance were quantified for 112 of the <b>leopard</b> <b>cat</b> presence sites and an equal number of randomly selected sites. Statistical analyses (e. g., t-tests, and Pearson correlation analysis) showed that elevation, ridges, plains, % water cover, distance to water source, vegetated area, deciduous forest, coniferous forest, and distance to paved road differed significantly (P < 0. 01) between presence and random sites. Stepwise logistic regression was used to develop a habitat model. Landform type (e. g., ridges vs. plains) is the major topographic factor affecting <b>leopard</b> <b>cat</b> presence. The species also appears to prefer deciduous forests and areas far from paved roads. The habitat map derived from the model correctly classified 93. 75 % of data from an independent sample of <b>leopard</b> <b>cat</b> presence sites, and the map at a regional scale showed that the cat’s habitats are highly fragmented. Protection and restoration of connectivity of critical habitats should be implemented to preserve the <b>leopard</b> <b>cat</b> in mountainous regions of Korea...|$|R

25|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of 39 <b>leopard</b> <b>cat</b> tissue samples clearly showed three clades: a northern lineage and southern lineages 1 and 2. The northern lineage comprises <b>leopard</b> <b>cats</b> from Tsushima Islands, the Korean Peninsula, the continental Far East, Taiwan, and Iriomote Island.

30|$|<b>Leopard</b> <b>cat</b> hairs {{were found}} in large numbers in stomach and scat samples from the visual {{analysis}} and sequencing results (8 of 56 samples analyzed were confirmed as <b>leopard</b> <b>cat</b> hair). Hairs in stomach and scat samples are most likely {{a result of their}} own grooming rather than cannibalism (Grassman et al. 2005). Plants comprised 9.1 % of the stomach contents. Given that chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and Alaskan brown bears (Ursus arctos) consume high-fiber items to control parasites (Huffman 1997), it is possible that this is the same reason for plant consumption among <b>leopard</b> <b>cats.</b> In addition, a few studies suggested that this phenomenon is an unintentional consequence of feeding on animal prey, and that consumption of plants by the snow leopard Uncia uncia and <b>leopard</b> <b>cat</b> P. bengalensis is likely to provide mineral or vitamin supplements, which cannot easily be obtained from animal prey (Shehzad et al. 2012). However, it remains unclear whether the plants were accidentally or intentionally eaten.|$|R
