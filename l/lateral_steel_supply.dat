Using research of supply chain response time for reference, this paper studied value of information synergy in <b>steel</b> closed-loop <b>supply</b> chain. Profit {{model of information}} synergy and profit of <b>steel</b> closed-loop <b>supply</b> chain in a two modes closed-loop supply chain that consisted of one steel enterprise and a seller was constructed in this paper. The result shows that within a certain range, as information synergy increases, benefit of <b>steel</b> closed-loop <b>supply</b> chain increases too. The study has {{an important role in}} research on information synergy in <b>steel</b> closed-loop <b>supply</b> chain. It also supports research for information synergy...|$|R

40|$|Many {{academics}} {{have studied}} the steel industry {{with the aim of}} implementing improvements in the sector. Although these provide snapshots {{of the structure of the}} supply chain, the evolution that has occurred is less well understood. This paper studies, primarily using process mapping techniques, the evolution of a case study <b>steel</b> <b>supply</b> chain within the UK over the past decade, drawing both on previous work and current research. The changes that have occurred are identified and categorised and their impact on inventory, lead times and asset utilisation will be assessed. It has been proposed that supply chains evolve from a traditional (uncoordinated, disparate, sub-optimal) to an integrated supply chain structure. The paper concludes that although the <b>steel</b> <b>supply</b> chain has evolved between 1990 and 2001 towards an integrated structure, there are currently constraints imposed by organisational boundaries...|$|R
