40|$|SUMMARY: Studies by cinemicrography {{confirm that}} the <b>long</b> <b>forms</b> of Proteus vulgaris (Hauser) seen during the {{swarming}} stage are morphologically indistinguish-able from those induced by penicillin and other toxic agents. They appear only in cultures which are growing freely and when a threshold concentration of population has been reached; thereafter the organisms at the growing edge of t,he colony become more abnormal with each swarming. The normal small bacilli may begin to move before any <b>long</b> <b>forms</b> are present. In later swarmings, movement {{may be seen in}} small as well as in long organisms. It is suggested that the <b>long</b> <b>forms</b> are induced by a non-specific volatile agent which can not be detected when growth has been cleared from the medium. Its action is enhanced in cultures which are confined under a coverslip. Though it is partially neutralized by the action of catalase, conclusive proof of its nature is still lacking. When different strains are grown together <b>long</b> <b>forms</b> are soon produced. The agents causing this are specific and stable, producing their effect immediately, and are detectable in the medium after the primary culture has been cleared from it...|$|R

40|$|Given the {{increasing}} number of neologisms in biomedicine (names of genes, diseases, molecules, etc.), the rate of acronyms used in literature also increases. Existing acronym dictionaries cannot keep up with the rate of new creations. Thus, discovering and disambiguating acronyms and their expanded forms are essential aspects of text mining and terminology management. We present a method for clustering <b>long</b> <b>forms</b> identified by an acronym recognition method. Applying the acronym recognition method to MEDLINE abstracts, we obtained a list of short/long forms. The recognized short/long forms were classified by a biologist to construct an evaluation set for clustering sets of similar <b>long</b> <b>forms.</b> We observed five types of term variation in the evaluation set and defined four similarity measures to gathers the similar <b>long</b> <b>forms</b> (i. e., orthographic, morphological, syntactic, lexico semantic variants, nested abbreviations). The complete-link clustering with the four similarity measures achieved 87. 5 % precision and 84. 9 % recall on the evaluation set. 1...|$|R

40|$|Many {{abbreviations}} {{are used}} in the literature especially in the life sciences, and polysemous abbreviations appear frequently, making it difficult to read and understand scientific papers that are outside of a reader’s expertise. Thus, we have developed Allie, a database and a search service of abbreviations and their <b>long</b> <b>forms</b> (a. k. a. full forms or definitions). Allie searches for abbreviations and their corresponding <b>long</b> <b>forms</b> in a database that we have generated based on all titles and abstracts in MEDLINE. When a user query matches an abbreviation, Allie returns all potential <b>long</b> <b>forms</b> of the query along with their bibliographic data (i. e. title and publication year). In addition, for each candidate, co-occurring abbreviations and a research field in which it frequently appears in the MEDLINE data are displayed. This function helps users learn about the context in which an abbreviation appears. To deal with synonymous <b>long</b> <b>forms,</b> we use a dictionary called GENA that contains domain-specific terms such as gene, protein or disease names along with their synonymic information. Conceptually identical domain-specific terms are regarded as one term, and then conceptually identical abbreviation-long form pairs are grouped taking into account their appearance in MEDLINE. To keep up with new abbre-viations that are continuously introduced, Allie has an automatic update system. In addition, the database of abbreviation...|$|R
