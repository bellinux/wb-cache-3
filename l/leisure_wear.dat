5|$|In the {{original}} series, divisions in ship assignments were denoted by shirt color; for the movie, these color codes {{were moved to}} small patches on each person's uniform. The Starfleet delta symbol, which previously indicated duty branches—command, science, medical, engineering, and so forth—was replaced with the command symbol for all branches, superimposed over a circle of color indicating area of service. The blue color of previous uniforms was discarded, for fear they might interfere with the blue screens used for optical effects. Three types of uniforms were fabricated: dress uniforms used for special occasions, Class A uniforms for regular duty, and Class B uniforms as an alternative. The Class A designs were double-stitched in gabardine and featured gold braid designating rank. It was felt that the traditional four gold sleeve stripes for the captain's rank was too blatantly militaristic. Povill had to send out a memo to Fletcher with the modified stripe rank system, as the designer continued to get the 20th and 23rd centuries confused. Fletcher designed the Class B uniform as similar to evolved T-shirts, with shoulder boards used to indicate rank and service divisions. Each costume had the shoes built into the pant leg to further the futuristic look. An Italian shoemaker decorated by the Italian government for making Gucci shoes was tasked with creating the futuristic footwear. Combining the shoes and trousers was difficult, time-consuming, and expensive, as each shoe had to be sewn by hand after being fitted to each principal actor. There were difficulties in communication, as the shoemaker spoke limited English and occasionally confused shoe orders due to similar-sounding names. Jumpsuits, serving a more utilitarian function, were the only costumes to have pockets, and were made with a heavyweight spandex that required a special needle to puncture the thick material. A variety of field jackets, <b>leisure</b> <b>wear,</b> and spacesuits were also created; as these parts had to be designed and completed before most of the actors' parts had been cast, many roles were filled by considering how well the actors would fit into existing costumes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lounge suit}} was once only worn as smart <b>leisure</b> <b>wear</b> {{in the country}} or at the seaside, {{but in the middle}} of the 19th century started to rise rapidly in popularity. [...] It took on the role of a more casual {{alternative}} to the morning coat for town wear, moving the latter up in the scale of formality. The more the morning coat became fashionable as correct daytime full dress, the more the lounge suit became acceptable as an informal alternative, and finally the more the frock coat became relegated to the status of ultra-formal day wear, worn only by older men. [...] At the most formal events during the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, heads of government wore the frock coat, but at more informal meetings they wore morning coats or even a lounge suit. In 1926, George V hastened the demise of the frock coat when he shocked the public by appearing at the opening of the Chelsea Flower Show wearing a morning coat. The frock coat barely survived the 1930s only as an ultra-formal form of court dress, until being finally officially abolished in 1936 as official court dress by Edward VIII (who later abdicated to become the Duke of Windsor). [...] It was replaced by the morning coat, thus consigning the frock coat to the status of historic dress.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} the GP’s attire on the confidence that patients have in their GP as a medical expert and on the patient’s comfort level (defined as ‘feel at ease’). Design: A cross-section study without control group. Methods: Participants (n= 1506) completed a survey on the internet or in paper after seeing images of six models of three different age categories, each in five different clothing styles (leisure clothing, casual, semiformal, formal and professional). The following questions were asked for each model: “In which doctor do you have the most confidence as a medical expert?” and “With which doctor do you feel most at ease?”. Results: Patients trusted a female doctor and the older male doctor most when wearing professional clothing (white coat). The young and middle aged GP’s were preferred to wear semiformal attire. Patients were most at ease with a female GP <b>wearing</b> <b>leisure</b> clothing. They preferred the young and middle aged male GP to wear semiformal attire, while patients were most at ease with the older male GP wearing casual clothing.

40|$|Background: Humans are {{involved}} {{in every aspect of}} fashion including design, manufacture, retail, consumption and disposal. Fashion affects us as individuals, in relationships, groups, societies and communities at home, work and <b>leisure.</b> What we <b>wear</b> influences our own and others’ perceptions, our emotions, self-esteem, body-image and confidence. Fashion is powerful and its addictive appeal can lead to economic and environmental problems. However, the potential for harnessing its power to enhance well-being, through applying psychological principles and theories, has not been attempted. Aim: To consider how psychology can be applied in the fashion industries to enhance well-being. Expected outcomes for participants: Participants will discuss the application of psychology to fashion, discuss existing problems, contribute to an action plan and be invited to join a network to work towards promoting well-being through fashion. Key points: Fashion matters! The fashion industry employs almost one million people in the UK and contributes more than £ 25 billion to the British economy annually. It influences and is influenced by psychological factors of individuals, groups and communities, yet traditionally, psychology has been ignored in fashion studies. Existing problems related to fashion include, but are not limited to, social and beauty ideals lacking diversity, unregulated cosmetic treatment and surgery, unethical fashion production, consumption and disposal leading to environmental problems, issues of self-esteem, dysmorphia, eating disorders, and so on. Conclusions: The workshop will identify and discuss existing problems, develop action plans and establish a network of psychologists who wish to apply psychological theory to enhance well-being in fashion...|$|R

40|$|Local {{authorities}} {{have a long}} history of providing recreation and leisure services, but since the 1970 s leisure departments have expanded with a corresponding growth in the number and importance of professional officers to run them. Growing affluence and improvements in the quality of life have led to a recognition of the social importance of leisure provision, and more recently its economic importance has been established with the introduction of schemes aimed at rejuvenating local areas. This thesis investigates the internal workings of two neighbouring local authorities in the North East of England. It is a comparative study of the District Councils of Wear Valley and Chester-le-Street, focusing primarily on the importance of leisure services in the public sector. It draws attention to the importance of leisure to justify local government as elected bodies concerned with the overall well-being of their local communities. After considering historical, philosophical and sociological perspectives on leisure, and examining the role of public bodies in the provision of leisure, the thesis proceeds with a detailed analysis of <b>leisure</b> services in <b>Wear</b> Valley and Chester-le-Street in a period of dramatic change. An evaluation of the differences in each District and their responses leads to a consideration of the 'Enabling' role now expected of all local authorities. Although local government is an important element in the British political system, it has been subjected to a plethora of legislation since 1979, aimed at reducing public spending and questioning and controlling the role and purpose of local authorities. The comparison of the two Districts involves an investigation of their internal conduct and business. It finds that leisure services are an increasingly important reasons for maintaining elected local authorities...|$|R
40|$|Articulated as a {{practice}} of design-couture, conceptualized as a project that seeks a sense of social engagement through research, design and making of everyday ‘common couture’, Rusted puts craft action in a very close relation with daily (political) or practical life. Rusted designs collage pre-used fabric and clothing (found, bought or gifted) with new cloth, thus using items of fabric and clothing from different times, countries and with variety of social histories. This collaged sensibility and the act of sewing becomes {{a way of thinking}} about the different ways in which clothing is made and how styles change in respect to technology, economics, fashion, business and social change. For Making Futures 2013 Rusted will present a series of new apron designs. Rusted is particularly interested in the apron as a fashion garment, perceived as an interlayer (an interface) between the private and public self, between work-craft and <b>leisure,</b> between work <b>wear</b> and urban chic, and between universal overall and individual identity. We conceive of the new apron as an entire way of thinking and being, enabling a review of definitions and conventions of fashion. Appropriately designed as an over-garment, the apron is a symbol of interconnectedness, possessing a sense of flow between daily life and work, fluidity between work-wear to evening-wear, fluidity between men‘s wear and women‘s wear and ultimately fluidity between art, craft and society. The power of the apron, flexible in terms of practicality and symbolically (as a notional protective garment), potentially lies in its capacity to enable the wearer to adorn more expensive clothes at work, home and at leisure – the apron protects the wearer’s clothes from stains, stresses and abrasions. To only wash and replace the apron may also have an ecological role to play in reducing the number of clothes one needs and of reducing the number of washes of many clothes at high temperatures (Fletcher 2008, Flint 2011). Taking inspiration from a variety of references, including traditional folk costumes, pit brow lass dress or the work of contemporary designers such as Martin Margiela or Teresa Martin, Rusted aims to animate the discussion on tradition vs. innovation in fashion and contribute to the current debate on the role of functionality, storytelling and emotional attachment to textiles in extending the lifecycle of clothing...|$|R
40|$|The bitless bridle {{has been}} {{advocated}} {{as an alternative}} to traditional bitted bridles in many equestrian disciplines in order to avoid bit injury and distress that has been reported in previous research. Anecdotal observations and lay publications suggest that the bitless bridle has become very popular amongst riders and horse owners in the United Kingdom. The bitless bridle has been compared favourably {{to the use of the}} bit in foundation training with improved performance in bridling, long-reining and riding reported for some horses in the bitless sample group. Similarly, improved dressage test scores and comments by a judge have been attributed to the use of the bitless bridle with a comparison of tests ridden in a bitted and bitless bridle one after the other. However objective data do not exist on the alternative use of bitless bridles by leisure riders for the majority of horses in the UK, used primarily for hacking, local shows and riding club purposes. The aim of this study was to compare the behaviours exhibited by <b>leisure</b> horses whilst <b>wearing</b> the bitless bridle with those shown when ridden in the usual bitted bridle. A second qualitative study involved the collection of data from a specifically designed questionnaire to obtain an understanding of the term leisure rider. The quantitative study entailed 12 subjects randomly selected from a population of privately- and college- owned horses which were ridden by a single qualified rider in the Preliminary 4 British Dressage test in their usual bitted bridle and 2 bit and in the Dr CookTM brand Beta Bitless Bridle. All tests were videoed continuously allowing the subsequent instantaneous recording of behaviour. An ethogram developed specifically for the study was used to collate identified conflict behaviours exhibited by the horse. Assessment of pilot data demonstrated that six different conflict behaviours occur with both types of bridle (tail swish, open mouth, cow kick, hollow, fall out and pull down). The frequency of each behaviour was recorded, along with the total number of behaviours exhibited (Behavioural Intensity) for both conditions. Whilst a similar amount of conflict behavioural activity was observed with both bridle types, significantly more tail swishing was observed with the bitless bridle (median occurrence/test = 3. 00; range 0 - 37) than with the bitted bridle (median occurrence/test = 2; range 0 - 23; Wilcoxon T 12 = 1. 00; P< 0. 05) ...|$|R

5000|$|The over-frock was the {{standard}} overcoat {{for much of}} the Victorian era and until after the First World War. Its popularity mirrored the frock coat, which replaced the tailcoat as day-wear in the 1850s. The frock coat, {{as a result of the}} fashion influence of the Regency dandy George Bryan 'Beau' Brummell, was almost universally black, and was worn with waistcoat and trousers, which could be of any colour. Black coat, waistcoat, and trousers - 'frock suits' - were worn only for funerals (as a 'mourning suit') and the most formal of occasions. The trousers could either be checked or striped, or have no pattern at all. The frock coat, and with it the over-frock, was increasingly rarely worn as casual wear towards the end of the nineteenth century, as the [...] "sack suit", the comparatively loose modern suit was adopted for <b>leisure</b> <b>wear,</b> and the morning coat, originally for equestrian use, replaced it for some formal events.
