40|$|The South African {{coastline}} has a {{high potential}} for mariculture development, particularly in land-based systems, due to excellent water quality, good infrastructure, and relatively cheap land in certain areas. Development of mariculture however, has been slow primarily due {{to the absence of}} a national sector development plan to coordinate contribution to development by government, industry and academia. Recent mariculture development plans however, supported by government commitment to stimulate coastal development, offers new opportunity for the sector's growth. These new sector development plans require a multi-disciplinary intensive information base with a strong regional and national spatial component. Geographic Information System (GIS) is a spatial analytical tool, which is capable of handling such large coastal databases and analysing them. Nevertheless, many mariculture GIS planning applications, often developed in isolation and with limited practical use for decision makers, highlighted the need to develop GIS in relation to the mariculture sector development plan. Hence, the aim {{of this study was to}} develop and evaluate a GIS for the national and regional mariculture sector planning process in South Africa, in order to identify potentially suitable areas along the South African coastline for mariculture operations. The GIS development in this study was based on the mariculture planning approach developed by PAP/RAe (1996), which recognizes the variations of scales in mariculture planning. Three case studies, representing the diversity of the South African sector plan, were selected to develop the GIS. They included: a national suitability analysis for all land-based culture systems, a specific national analysis on abalone ranching, and a detailed regional analysis of land-based culture and abalone ranching along the Namaqualand coastline. The GIS was developed separately for each case study based on a strategy consisting of six main phases, including: identification of project requirements, developing analytical framework, selection and location of data sources, organization and manipulation of data, analysing data and verifying and evaluation of the outputs. Biophysical, coastal use, and infrastructure criteria were collected, sorted and analysed to identify development constraints. Based on a set of conditions, and Boolean logic and arithmetic operations, unsuitable areas were identified and eliminated. Main constraints for national land-based development included competition over space along KwaZuluNatal Province coastline and restricted access to the coast along the south region of the Northern Cape Province, Wild Coast along the Eastern Cape Province, and Maputaland along KwaZulu-Natal Province. Ten areas along the country coastline were therefore identified as potentially suitable for <b>land-based</b> <b>mariculture.</b> Furthermore, South African abalone ranching potential was found to be limited mostly along the Western and Northern Cape Province's coastline due to the high risk of Paralytic Shellfish Poison (PSP) occurrences, alternative resource use and activities such as commercial fishery, poaching, and conservation. Hence, a total of nine areas along the Northern Cape, Western Cape, and Eastern Cape coastlines were identified as premier areas for abalone ranching. The regional study along the Namaqualand coastline revealed potential conflict between mining activity and mariculture development due to security issues and restricted access to the coast. <b>Land-based</b> <b>mariculture</b> development was confined to the four main coastal urban areas. The highest potential for <b>land-based</b> <b>mariculture</b> was along Port Nolloth and Kleinsee coastlines, whereas marine-based (i. e. abalone ranching) potential was poor along the north part of the coast due to intense marine mining activities, restricted access to the coast, and low kelp bed density. High potential abalone ranching areas were identified south to Kleinsee, and around Port Nolloth. Potential conflict with marine mining activity was minimal since it was localised and not related to kelp bed locations. It was concluded that GIS is a relevant and compatible tool for South African mariculture sector planning. However, future development of GIS as integrated planning tool in mariculture and coastal planning, requires updated spatial data (e. g. recreational activity), and continued interaction among project planners, mariculture specialists and GIS analysts...|$|E
40|$|The tetrasporophyte of Asparagopsis armata {{has been}} {{previously}} established as a novel seaweed biofilter for integrated <b>land-based</b> <b>mariculture.</b> The species growth and biofiltration rates were {{much higher than the}} values described in the literature for Ulva spp., the most common seaweed biofilter. However, a validation of the advantage of one species over the other requires a study of the performances of these two species in the same system at the same time. In this work, we compared the biofiltration performance and biomass yield of A. armata and Ulva rigida cultivated in the effluents of a fish farm in southern Portugal. Comparisons were performed at different water renewal rates and in two seasons of the year. The maximum total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) removal rates were similar for both species in December (2. 7 and 2. 8 g TAN m– 2 day– 1 for U. rigida and A. armata, respectively) and higher for A. armata (6. 5 g TAN m– 2 day– 1) than for U. rigida (5. 1 g TAN m– 2 day– 1) in May. Higher differences were observed when estimating the nitrogen biofiltration through the organic nitrogen yield (N yield) of the biomass produced, particularly in May. This estimate is directly related with the biomass yield and the N content in the tissue which were always higher for A. armata than for U. rigida. In December, the maximum biomass yields were 71 g dry weight (DW) m– 2 day– 1 for A. armata and 44 g DW m– 2 day– 1 for U. rigida, while in May, the yield of A. armata was 125 g DW m– 2 day– 1 and of U. rigida was 73 g DW m– 2 day– 1. This study confirmed that A. armata is indeed a more efficient biofilter than U. rigida. To the best of our knowledge, the production rates reported here are the highest ever reported for macroalgae cultivated in tanks...|$|E
40|$|Sustainable and {{long-term}} {{growth of the}} aquaculture industry should involve both ecologically sound practices and appropriate resource management. The increasing economic dimension of Mediterranean aquaculture is opening new economic niches and may be a valid support to reduce the pressure of traditional fisheries. Aquaculture practices {{can also lead to}} modifications of coastal habitats through the impact of wastes of <b>land-based</b> and open-sea <b>mariculture</b> facilities. In addition to these aspects which place a direct pressure on aquatic ecosystems and wild fishery resources, a wide range of environmental contaminants, such as chemicals used in farming operations, can accumulate in farmed organisms and put fish health and quality at risk. Thus, as aquaculture makes its transition to a major food-producing sector, proper assessment and control of environmental impacts and food safety awareness are becoming increasingly important. The development of simple tools able to monitor the extent of environmental and biological impacts associated with farming operations at various levels of biological complexity from the ecosystem to the organism level is required. Although a number of techniques for assessing the environmental and biological impact of pollutants in natural ecosystems are available, the development of practical and validated tools is sorely needed in aquaculture...|$|R
