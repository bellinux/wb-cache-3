50|$|Anodorhynchus is a genus {{of large}} <b>blue</b> <b>macaws</b> from open and semi-open {{habitats}} {{in central and}} eastern South America. It includes two endangered species, the hyacinth macaw and Lear's macaw also known as the indigo macaw, and one probably extinct species, the glaucous macaw. At about 100 cm in length the hyacinth macaw is the longest parrot in the world. Glaucous and Lear's macaws are exclusively cliff nesters; hyacinth macaws are mostly tree nesters. The three species mainly feed on the nuts from a few species of palms (notably Acrocomia aculeata, Attalea phalerata, Butia yatay and Syagrus coronata).|$|R

One had a car of ebony, drawn by white pigeons, another was lying back in her ivory chariot, driving ten black crows, while the rest had chosen rare woods or many-coloured sea-shells, with scarlet and <b>blue</b> <b>macaws,</b> long-tailed peacocks, or green love-birds for horses.

2500|$|Naturalists {{have noted}} the Spix's {{similarity}} to other smaller members of tribe Arini based on general morphology {{as long ago as}} Rev. F.G. Dutton, president of the Avicultural Society U.K. in 1900: [...] "it's more like a conure" [...] ('conure' is not a defined taxon – in Dutton's time, it referred to the archaic genus Conurus; today those would be among the smaller non-macaw parakeets in Arini). Brazilian ornithologist Helmut Sick stated in 1981: [...] "Cyanopsitta spixii...is not a real macaw". (Sick's remark was {{in the context of an}} article on Lear's <b>macaw,</b> a larger <b>blue</b> <b>macaw.</b> He recognized, as Spix had not 150 years before, that C. spixii is notably different from the larger macaws).|$|R
