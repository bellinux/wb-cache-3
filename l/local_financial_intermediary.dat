40|$|Environmental {{degradation}} is {{the result}} of complex human-environment dynamics, often sustained by socio-economic inequalities. Recently microfinance has been proposed to be an interesting tool to support environmental protection strategies that aim at once to foster rural development and promote ecosystems conservation or adaptation to climate change. In this paper we provide one of the first analysis of the link between microfinance and ecosystems conservation. We base our analysis on the assessment of the first large-scale microfinance programme for biodiversity conservation: Proyecto CAMBio. Our empirical analysis exploits a unique set of secondary and primary data collected by the authors in Nicaragua and Guatemala. We introduce a theoretical framework and a practical methodology to assess such programme, and we apply it to our case studies. Even if with different peculiarities, the two cases studied show that microfinance for ecosystems conservation has good potentialities to introduce environmental elements in the rural activities of small farmers and in the products provided by microfinance institutions, and it is an interesting path to pursue. However, they also underline that choices and actions of rural households and <b>local</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> institutions are strongly influenced by habits and local dominant development pathways, which are among the main causes of socio-economic inequalities and environmental degradation. Green Microfinance per se {{does not seem to be}} able to revert such dangerous dynamics while, interacting with them without a proactive strategy, it risks to have no effect or eventually support the causes of environmental degradation. We then call for a renewed proactive role of green microfinance for ecosystems that, articulating with local actors and territorial dynamics, should aim not only at providing a green product to individual farmers, but instead support new alliances and collective, socially informed, actions to redirect the habits that support environmental degradation towards environmentally friendly and socioeconomic inclusive rural development. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The present {{research}} work has set {{to examine the}} performance of Greek co-operative banks and their importance {{for the development of}} the local areas they serve. The decade of the ' 90 s can be regarded as the one in which Greek co-operative banks has actually emerged and made their first successful steps. Three credit co-operatives at the beginning of the decade were transformed into cooperative banks in 1992 when the legal framework provided such an opportunity. At the dawn of the new millennium there were 15 co-operative banks, all located at provincial towns. Within this period they have managed to build their apex institutions, a national association and their central bank. In order to form the framework of analysis, the research approach focussed on the dual capacity of co-operative banks i. e. as a local grass-root initiative and as a <b>local</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary.</b> It questioned, from a theoretical and from a policy implementation perspective, the characteristics that a local initiative should enjoy in order to contribute to local and regional development. On the other hand, it tried to explore the potential of a local bank in a rapidly changing European banking market. The history and experiences of financial co-operatives under different settings has been used as a reference point for comparisons and necessary evaluations. This work examines the guidelines for the evaluation of the performance of the Greek co-operative banks. However, as this thesis is the first systematic approach of the co-operative banking in Greece, it had to provide evidence for the reasons that delayed their appearance until 1993 and for the reasons that made their entrance in the market possible. These required a review of the evolution of the Greek banking system and of the historical developmental conditions in order to be addressed. Field work comprised two surveys conducted by the researcher. The first was addressed to the fifteen co-operative banks. With the second survey, the researcher approached a stratified sample of 308 members, whom he contacted for personal interviews on the basis of a structured questionnaire. Information derived from these surveys along with secondary data that were collected from various sources, were used for the evaluation of the performance of the Greek co-operative banking system. The analysis showed that Greek co-operative banks are still found in a period of transition. This rather concerns internal growth strategies and policies to strengthen their position at local markets and less the possibility of new entrances in the local scene. Moreover, there appears to be a wide gap in the performance of various initiatives that stress for the necessity of strengthening further their organizational structure. On the other hand, the analysis provided evidence for a performance that can alter essentially the quantitative and qualitative characteristics in the local context and influence positively the development process in the periphery. In order to retain their ability to influence the financial markets and the development process, the Greek co-operative banks would have to create strong links with local people. Building a co-operative corporate identity is regarded as the most promising direction for them to follow in order to signal their difference in a highly competitive banking market and within a most demanding rural development context.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a study {{about the effect of}} {{relationship}} lending on credit availability for Italian firms, with a special focus on the 2008 - 09 financial crises. According to the conventional wisdom, the central principle of relationship finance is that that personal interaction between bankers and small borrowers creates information efficiency that allow credit to flow more efficiently and commerce to grow more. The recent financial crisis would have revived the role of relationship lending: a natural implication of information asymmetries in credit markets is that, in a period of high risk aversion and borrowers? opaqueness- as it is in a financial crisis-, the comparative advantage of producing soft information should become far more relevant. Against this background, this paper focuses on the supply side of the Italian credit market by testing the prediction that, during the financial crisis, firms relying more on local banks have been less credit rationed than other firms. To this end, first, we develop an index, based on banks' credit concentration across local credit markets, which helps us to identify <b>local</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries.</b> Second, we develop a sample of 3. 281 firms from 2006 to 2009 for which we have full information on credit rationing from the Survey of Industrial and Service Firms from Bank of Italy (INVIND survey), as well as balance sheet data from the Cerved dataset, and relationship lending information from the Credit Register (CR) dataset. Third, we test empirically if firms financed by local banks experienced a lower credit rationing during the 2008 - 09 crisis than other firms. The main result of the paper is that firms predominantly funded by local banks have been less rationed during the 2008 - 09 financial crisis. This result holds when we consider also the firm and bank characteristics, the shape of the bank-firm relationship, and the features of the local credit market where the firm is located. Our findings support the view that local banks may address firms' financial needs in a better way than not local banks because of their comparative advantage at collecting local information. This advantage appears to be relevant in a period of high risk aversion as the recent financial crisis...|$|R

Through NGOs, government agencies and banks, vast numbers of self-help groups have been established in recent years: as selfreliant autonomous <b>local</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries.</b> 85 % of the members are women; they have proven to be the better savers, borrowers and investors. Most of them are from the lowest castes and other disadvantaged groups. The SHGs mobilize their own savings, transform them into loans to members and plow their earnings from interest income back into equity. On that basis, SHGs and banks enter into commercial relations of mutual benefit, with low bank and client transaction costs and negligible risks. In the absence of interest rate restrictions and with repayment rates > 99 %, SHG banking is highly profitable – a message that has convinced hesitant bank managers in increasing numbers. SHGs are now forming local networks with their own cooperative financial institutions. The program has turned into a social movement, with high expansion rates in recent years. Fuelled by competence and enthusiasm at all stakeholder levels, it expands rapidly throughout India, including marginal and tribal areas. It is probably the world?s largest and most successful microfinance program for the rural poor – outstanding in its emphasis on self-reliance and local autonomy of the very poor. Here are some outreach and performance figures (Dec. 2000) : - 364, 000 SHGs established as autonomous financial intermediaries; - 5. 8 million SHG members - 30 million rural poor covered as household members - 194, 500 SHGs credit-linked to banks - 380 banks and 8000 bank branches involved as bank partners - Non-performing bank loans to SHGs: 0 % - 750 NGOs and many GOs involved as social mobilizers and facilitators. A TAG to disseminate SHG banking in Asia – reaching hundreds of millions: NABARD is now facing the combined challenges of how to disseminate the approach throughout India and the region; and how to continue financing the incremental costs of technical and financial assistance to the participating agencies. This calls for a coordinated donor effort: with the objective of strengthening and mainstreaming the program in India and disseminating it throughout the Asia region. IFAD, together with ADB and other donors, might play a key role: promoting financial services that benefit hundreds of millions of the rural poor in Asia. As a first step, a feasibility study is suggested in preparation of a TAG for assessing, packaging and mainstreaming SHG banking innovations and disseminating them throughout India and the Asia region.

We examine the relation between <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development and income inequality in a panel data set of 91 countries for the period of 1960 - 95.
