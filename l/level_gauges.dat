The Fairmont was also fitted with chrome insert side body mouldings and carried over the tail light lenses from the previous EF model.|$|E
2500|$|In the North American market, the Celica Supra was {{available}} in two distinct models. There was the [...] "Performance Type" [...] (P-type) and the [...] "Luxury Type" [...] (L-type). While being mechanically identical, they were differentiated by the available options; tire size, wheel size, and body trim. The P-type had fiberglass fender flares over the wheel wells, while the L-type did not. The P-type was also standard with the more sporty eight-way adjustable seats. The P-type {{did not get the}} option of a leather interior until 1983. All editions of the P-type had the same 14x7-inch aluminum alloy wheels and throughout the years the L-type had 14x5.5-inch wheels until 1985 when they were changed to a P-type styled 15x6. The L-type also had the option of a digital dash with trip computer; some Canadian models had this option as well as a few rare instances of American models. The digital dash featured a digital tachometer, digital speedometer, and electronic fuel level and coolant <b>level</b> <b>gauges.</b> The trip computer could calculate and display various things such as fuel economy in miles-per-gallon, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and distance remaining to destination. Excluding the 1982 model, all P-types were available with headlight washers as an option, but the L-types were never given such an option. Although gear ratios changed throughout the years, all P-types came standard with a limited slip differential.|$|E

30|$|We will {{compare this}} seismic {{activity}} with the crustal deformation after 1976 (Ukawa et al. 2006). NIED conducted leveling and trilateration 11 times {{every other year}} from 1976 to 1995. Furthermore, GPS surveys were conducted 10 times every 2  years from 1996 to 2016. Results until 2002 are summarized in Ukawa et al. (2006). Figure  2 b shows vertical movement obtained by leveling and GPS from 1977 at the survey point within 10  m of the observation point where GNSS continuous observation was carried out.

40|$|A {{prototype}} of a liquid <b>level</b> <b>gauge</b> based on pulsed time-of-flight (TOF) method {{was developed for}} measuring liquid level accurately at distances from zero to 30 metres. The system consists of an optomechanical sensor head and electronics unit which are connected to each other by means of two optical fibres.

The pulsing frequency of the laser is 1. 5 MHz and the time interval between start and stop pulses is digitized by means of a simple and inherently linear synchronous digital counter.

[...] The more modern design of the Morris was reflected in the superior performance of its hydraulically operated 8-inch drum brakes.

The steering wheel was non-dished, with three aluminium spokes, a thin bakelite rim and a centre horn button. Vinyl-covered seats with cloth centres and a fully carpeted floor were standard, while leather upholstery was an extra-cost option.After initially marketing it as a four-seater, Alfa Romeo soon changed its definition of the car to a more realistic 2+2.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{storage tank}} made of FRP has an inlet, an outlet, a vent, an access port, a drain, and an {{overflow}} nozzle. However, {{there are other}} features that can {{be included in the}} tank. Ladders on the outside allow for easy access to the roof for loading. The vessel must be designed to withstand the load of someone standing on these ladders, and even withstand a person standing on the roof. Sloped bottoms allow for easier draining. <b>Level</b> <b>gauges</b> allow someone to accurately read the liquid level in the tank. The vessel must be resistant to the corrosive nature of the fluid it contains. Typically, these vessels have a secondary containment structure, in case the vessel bursts.

50|$|When {{selecting}} a magnetic level gauge {{it is important}} {{to take into account the}} strength of the magnetic field. The magnetic field is the heart of the magnetic level gauge - the stronger the field, the more reliable the instrument will function. Some manufacturers rely on a single magnet for their magnetic <b>level</b> <b>gauges</b> which causes the strength of the north field to be identical to, and as weak as, the south field. It is apparent that at the location of the indicators, switches and transmitters, the field would not be as intense. Some manufacturers use a single annular ring magnet, others use a series of single bar magnets in a circular array in their float design. In this design the relative field strength of the north and south poles will be equal to one another and less than that of a dual magnet design. Moreover, the field strength as you travel around the circumference will have high and low spots as you pass between the individual bar magnets.|$|E
