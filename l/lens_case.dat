40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} {{the rates of}} microbial contamination of solutions and lens accessories of existing ortho-k lens wearers and the effect on contamination rates of monthly replacement and warnings. To investigate self-reported levels of compliance with care of the lenses and lens accessories and correlation of these levels with the rates of microbial contamination. Methods. Asymptomatic ortho-k lens wearers with at least 6 -month successful use were requested to bring their lenses, solutions, and accessories to their next aftercare visit. All items, except the lenses, were replaced at each data collection visit. Samples collected from the lens surface, solution, and accessories were cultured for pathogens. These procedures were repeated twice at 1 -month intervals. At the first visit, each subject and/or parent was interviewed about the care/use of the lens and accessories. Results. Thirty-eight subjects completed the study. Initial contamination rates of the <b>lenses,</b> <b>lens</b> <b>cases,</b> and tweezers were 29, 34, and 46 %, respectively. Rates of contamination dropped for lenses, suction holders, and tweezers during the three-visit intervention. Contact lens solutions, except lens cleaner were contaminated on all occasions with the most contaminated product being artificial tears [33 % (n = 18) ]. There was no improvement in the contamination rate of the <b>lens</b> <b>cases.</b> The most common pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus and Serratia marcescens. Compliance was lowest for care of <b>lens</b> <b>cases</b> and highest for care of lenses. However, correlation between reported compliance and presence of pathogens failed to reach significance. Conclusions. Subjects' awareness {{of the importance of}} lens cleanliness is high and can be improved by regular reinforcements. However, attitudes toward cleaning of accessories was far less satisfactory and while replacement and warnings resulted in significant improvements of contamination rates of tweezers and suction holders, more emphasis should be placed on educating patients on correct care of lens accessories.

40|$|Contact lens storage case {{contamination}} is {{a significant}} risk factor for contact lens related complications such as infection and inflammation. Currently, there are no evidence-based data to support current <b>lens</b> <b>case</b> cleaning guidelines. This represents a major challenge to eye care practitioners in educating lens wearers regarding hygiene practices to limit microbial contamination of lens cases and {{to reduce the risk}} of microbial related adverse events. The objective of this thesis was to develop an evidence-based contact <b>lens</b> <b>case</b> cleaning guideline to limit microbial contamination of contact lens cases. A cross-sectional study was conducted to characterize the scope of lens hygiene behaviour, followed by a microbiological study adopting a new sampling method to assess microbial contamination in lens cases. A systematic literature review and a survey were undertaken to establish the extent of current <b>lens</b> <b>case</b> cleaning guidelines available from authoritive sources. In vitro studies investigated the effectiveness of various cleaning methods commonly carried out by lens wearers. Based on this, a new guideline was proposed and finally, the effectiveness of the new <b>lens</b> <b>case</b> cleaning guidelines in reducing microbial contamination was tested in a clinical trial. A number of key findings were established from the above studies. <b>Lens</b> <b>case</b> hygiene practice is inadequate in lens wearers. <b>Lens</b> <b>case</b> contamination is common, and the rate and the profile of microbial contamination may be spatially distributed differently within one lens well, with aerobic organisms predominantly found at the air/fluid interface and facultative anaerobic within the case fluid. Inconsistent and inadequate contact <b>lens</b> <b>case</b> cleaning guidelines persist amongst industry, regulatory authority, and practitioners. Amongst <b>lens</b> <b>case</b> cleaning methods, mechanical friction is essential in removing biofilm. Hence, the most effective cleaning regimens proven in vitro and in vivo are rubbing, rinsing with disinfecting solution, tissue-wiping and air-drying lens cases. Lens cases should be air-dried face down to minimize air-borne microbial contamination. The topography and/or material of a lens well determine the ease of biofilm removal and surface contamination. The newly developed lens storage case cleaning guidelines were shown to limit microbial contamination of lens cases and can be used to educate lens wearers on how to clean lens cases.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Microbial corneal {{infection}} {{is the most}} serious complication of contact lens wear. Contact lens cases are a recognised potential source of pathogens associated with corneal ulcers. METHODS [...] This survey established the incidence of protozoal, bacterial, and fungal contact <b>lens</b> <b>case</b> contamination in 101 asymptomatic daily wear cosmetic contact lens wearers from a domiciliary contact lens practice. RESULTS [...] Eighty two (81 %) contact lens cases were found to be contaminated, with 19 (19 %) sterile. Of all contact lens cases, 78 (77 %) grew bacteria, 24 (24 %) fungi, and 20 (20 %) protozoa. Acanthamoeba spp were isolated from eight (8 %) contact lens cases. Fifty six (55 %) contact lens cases yielded mixed bacterial contamination. This is the first contact <b>lens</b> <b>case</b> survey in which hydrogen peroxide disinfection was the major method of contact lens disinfection (75 % of subjects) and no home made saline was used. All the contaminating organisms were shown to possess the enzyme catalase that breaks down hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water.

We {{report the}} first case of contact lens-related Bacillus cereus {{keratitis}} and ulcer associated with B. cereus contamination of the contact <b>lens</b> <b>case.</b> This is also the first study to investigate and establish the genetic identity of an organism isolated from the cornea and contact <b>lens</b> <b>case</b> in a patient with contact lens-associated keratitis. Design. Case report. Intervention and testing. Conjunctival swabs and corneal scrapings from the left eye were inoculated for culture. The contact <b>lens</b> <b>case</b> was also cultured. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was determined by agar disk diffusion method. Initial treatment with topical ciprofloxacin and fortified tobramycin was given. Genetic analysis of the bacterial isolates was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus primers (ERIC; ERIC-PCR). Susceptibility of B. cereus to heat and contact lens disinfecting solutions containing hydrogen peroxide, hydrogen peroxide-catalase, polyquaternium- 1, and polyaminopropyl biguanide (PAPB) was tested. Main outcome measures. Clinical features, culture results, and antibiotic susceptibility testing were analyzed. The ERIC-PCR amplification products were visualized in ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel. Bacterial growth after exposure to heat and contact lens disinfecting solutions was assessed on blood agar plates. Results. B. cereus was grown from the conjunctiva, corneal ulcer, and contact <b>lens</b> <b>case.</b> All isolates were sensitive to gentamicin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. The corneal ulcer gradually healed over the next 6 days. Results of ERIC-PCR showed that the isolates from the cornea and contact <b>lens</b> <b>case</b> were indistinguishable, thus demonstrating the source of infecting organism to be the contaminated contact <b>lens</b> <b>case.</b> Exposure to a temperature of 80 °C for 20 minutes and incubation with hydrogen peroxide-catalase, polyquaternium- 1, and PAPB for the minimum recommended time failed to kill B. cereus. Only exposure to hydrogen peroxide for 4 hours eradicated the organism. Conclusions. B. cereus {{should be considered a}} possible etiologic agent of contact lens-associated keratitis. Heat and many types of contact lens disinfecting solutions may be ineffective in eradicating B. cereus from contaminated contact lens cases.

40|$|Purpose: To measure {{adhesion}} {{forces of}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Serratia marcescens to a rigid contact lens (CL), standard polypropylene, and Ag-impregnated lens cases using {{atomic force microscopy}} and determine bacterial transmission from <b>lens</b> <b>case</b> to CL. Methods: Adhesion forces of bacterial strains to Ag-impregnated and polypropylene lens cases and a rigid CL were measured using atomic force microscopy. Adhesion forces were used to calculate Weibull distributions, from which transmission probabilities from <b>lens</b> <b>case</b> to CL were derived. Transmission probabilities were compared with actual transmission of viable bacteria from a <b>lens</b> <b>case</b> to the CL in 0. 9 % NaCl and in an antimicrobial lens care solution. Results: Bacterial transmission probabilities from polypropylene lens cases based on force analysis coincided well for all strains with actual transmission in 0. 9 % NaCl. Bacterial adhesion forces on Ag-impregnated lens cases were much smaller than that on polypropylene and CLs, yielding a high probability of transmission. Comparison with actual bacterial transmission indicated bacterial killing due to Ag ions during colony-forming unit transmission from an Ag-impregnated <b>lens</b> <b>case,</b> especially for P. aeruginosa. Transmission of viable bacteria from Ag-impregnated lens cases could be further decreased by use of an antimicrobial lens care solution instead of 0. 9 % NaCl. Conclusions: Bacterial transmission probabilities are higher from Ag-impregnated lens cases than from polypropylene lens cases because of small adhesion forces, but this is compensated for by enhanced bacterial killing due to Ag impregnation, especially when in combination with an antimicrobial lens care solution. This calls for a balanced combination of antimicrobial lens care solutions and surface properties of a <b>lens</b> <b>case</b> and CL. ...|$|E
