It had permission to construct a line from South Kensington to Piccadilly Circus, but had not raised the capital to do so. At South Kensington it was to connect to the deep <b>level</b> <b>line</b> planned by the DR. On 12 September 1901, the DR-controlled board of the B sold the company to the MDETC. In the same month, the B took over the Great Northern and Strand Railway (GN), a tube railway with permission to build a line from Strand to Finsbury Park. The routes of the B and GN were subsequently linked and combined with part of the DR's tube route to create the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP).|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{detail in}} this paper the {{numerical}} implementation of the so-called image curvature microscope, an algorithm that computes accurate image curvatures at subpixel resolution, and yields a curvature map conforming with our visual perception. In contrast to standard methods, which would compute the curvature by a finite difference scheme, the curvatures are evaluated directly on the <b>level</b> <b>lines</b> of the bilinearly interpolated image, after their independent smoothing, a step necessary to remove pixelization artifacts. The smoothing step consists in the affine erosion of the <b>level</b> <b>lines</b> through a geometric scheme, and can be applied in parallel to all <b>level</b> <b>lines.</b> The online algorithm allows the user to visualize the image of curvatures at different resolutions, {{as well as the}} set of <b>level</b> <b>lines</b> before and after smoothing.

The inclusion relationship of the <b>level</b> <b>lines</b> (bound-aries of <b>level</b> sets) forms the tree of shapes, a tree-based image representation with a high potential.

We then show that the <b>level</b> <b>lines</b> are ``almost'' invariant for piecewise developable surfaces. Such surfaces fit most of the urban structures. In a second part, this allows us to devise a very fast algorithm that detects changes between pairs of remotely sensed images of urban areas, independently of the lighting conditions.
