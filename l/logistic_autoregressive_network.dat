40|$|Bayesian {{networks}} have {{become one of}} the major models used for statistical inference. We study the question whether the decisions computed by a Bayesian network can be represented within a low-dimensional inner product space. We focus on two-label classification tasks over the Boolean domain. As main results we establish upper and lower bounds on the dimension of the inner product space for Bayesian networks with an explicitly given (full or reduced) parameter collection. In particular, these bounds are tight up to a factor of 2. For some nontrivial cases of Bayesian networks we even determine the exact values of this dimension. We further consider <b>logistic</b> <b>autoregressive</b> Bayesian <b>networks</b> and show that every sufficiently expressive inner product space must have dimension at least Ω(n 2), where n is the number of network nodes. We also derive the bound 2 Ω(n) for an artificial variant of this network, thereby demonstrating the limits of our approach and raising an interesting open question. As a major technical contribution, this work reveals combinatorial and algebraic structures within Bayesian networks such that known methods for the derivation of lower bounds on the dimension of inner product spaces can be brought into play.

40|$|Abstract—Reservoir {{computing}} (RC) {{is a novel}} {{approach to}} time series prediction using recurrent neural networks. In RC, an input signal perturbs the intrinsic dynamics of a medium called a reservoir. A readout layer is then trained to reconstruct a target output from the reservoir’s state. The multitude of RC architectures and evaluation metrics poses a challenge to both practitioners and theorists who study the task-solving performance and computational power of RC. In addition, in contrast to traditional computation models, the reservoir is a dynamical system in which computation and memory are inseparable, and therefore hard to analyze. Here, we compare echo state networks (ESN), a popular RC architecture, with tapped-delay lines (DL) and nonlinear <b>autoregressive</b> exogenous (NARX) <b>networks,</b> which we use to model systems with limited computation and limited memory respectively. We compare {{the performance of the}} three sys-tems while computing three common benchmark time series: Hénon Map, NARMA 10, and NARMA 20. We find that the role of the reservoir in the reservoir computing paradigm goes beyond providing a memory of the past inputs. The DL and the NARX network have higher memorization capability, but fall short of the generalization power of the ESN.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{framework}} for learning Granger causality networks for multivariate categorical time series, {{based on the}} mixture transition distribution (MTD) model. Traditionally, MTD is plagued by a nonconvex objective, non-identifiability, and presence of many local optima. To circumvent these problems, we recast inference in the MTD as a convex problem. The new formulation facilitates the application of MTD to high-dimensional multivariate time series. As a baseline, we also formulate a multi-output <b>logistic</b> <b>autoregressive</b> model (mLTD), which while a straightforward extension of autoregressive Bernoulli generalized linear models, has not been previously applied {{to the analysis of}} multivariate categorial time series. We develop novel identifiability conditions of the MTD model and compare them to those for mLTD. We further devise novel and efficient optimization algorithm for the MTD based on the new convex formulation, and compare the MTD and mLTD in both simulated and real data experiments. Our approach simultaneously provides a comparison of methods for network inference in categorical time series and opens the door to modern, regularized inference with the MTD model...|$|R

40|$|The {{standard}} approach to analyzing categorical correlated time series data is {{to fit a}} generalized linear model (GLM) with past data as covariate inputs. There remain challenges to conducting inference for short time series length. By treating the historical data as covariate inputs, standard errors of estimates of GLM parameters computed using the empirical Fisher information do not fully account the auto-correlation in the data. To overcome this serious limitation, we derive the exact conditional Fisher information matrix of a general <b>logistic</b> <b>autoregressive</b> model with endogenous covariates for any series length T. Moreover, we also develop an iterative computational formula that allows for relatively easy implementation of the proposed estimator. Our simulation studies show that confidence intervals derived using the exact Fisher information matrix tend to be narrower than those utilizing the empirical Fisher information matrix while maintaining type I error rates at or below nominal levels. Further, we establish that the exact Fisher information matrix approaches, as T tends to infinity, the asymptotic Fisher information matrix previously derived for binary time series data.
