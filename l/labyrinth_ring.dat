40|$|<b>Labyrinth</b> <b>ring</b> and pins {{withdrawn}} from an aeroengine {{were sent to}} the laboratory to establish the reasons for the development of cracks, if any. Dye penetrant examination revealed cracks at about 4. 5 mm from the pinhead in 27 pins out of the 60 pins received for investigation. Microstructural examination and fractographic studies indicated that the cracks had initiated by fatigue, at the deformation mark at the disc/labyrinth ring interface, possibly due to axial movement of the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>ring.</b> It appears most probable that the differential thermal expansion of the ring and the disc resulted in loss interference between the disc and the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>ring</b> leading to axial movement of the ring...|$|E
40|$|This {{study shows}} the {{homologation}} of the plasma spray parameters of soft abrasive AlSi - Polyester seals {{so that they}} can be applied on the TV 2 - 117 A compressor engines. The research has aimed at substituting existing sealants with a new class of materials in order to increase the sealing effect under the highest levels of pressure and to provide the air flow temperature of 100 - 125 °C through the compressor. The Metco 601 NS material and plasma spray technology were applied on the air <b>labyrinth</b> <b>ring</b> as a part of the TV 2 - 117 A turbojet engine compressor in order to obtain soft sealing. The deposit parameters were carefully selected in order to obtain coatings with the best characteristics depending on their application. The flow of helium was taken as a basic parameter in the parameter selection procedure. The coating with the best mechanical and structural properties was deposited on the air <b>labyrinth</b> <b>ring</b> to examine the effect of the coating application in an assembly. The microstructures of deposited layers were estimated with a light microscope and a (SEM) Scanning Electron Microscope. The microstructural analysis of deposited layers was performed according to the Pratt - Whitney standard. The assessment of the mechanical properties of the coatings was done by examining the macrohardness of the sealing layers with the HR 15 Y method. The coating bond strength was tested by tensile testing. The effect of the air <b>labyrinth</b> <b>ring</b> sealing was tested inside the TV 2 - 117 A engine compressor on the test station for a period of 42 hour...|$|E
40|$|Labyrinth rings/pins {{belonging}} to {{a particular type of}} aeroengine were sent to the laboratory for analysis. Examination revealed presence of fatigue crack in the pins from all the three engines. Fatigue cracks were found to have initiated at the deformation marks at about 4. 5 mm from the pinhead. It appears most probable that these depression marks were formed by hot deformation at the disc/Labyrinth interface due to axial movement of the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>ring...</b>|$|E
40|$|There was an {{incidence}} to {{an aircraft}} wherein after flight, pilot noticed “Decelerate Right Engine” caption on MFWS along with longitudinal thud. Also, there was momentary display of “Right Engine Vibration” caption. Following this, the pilot {{switched off the}} RH engine and the aircraft landed with one engine (port). Boroscopic examination of the affected engine revealed damages in the turbine area, mostly concentrated in and around LP turbine. On strip examination, {{it was found that}} the LPTR blades, and a labyrinth with the LP turbine disc were severely damaged. A few of these damaged components, viz., (a) fractured and dislodged <b>labyrinth</b> support <b>ring</b> of LP turbine disc, (b) fractured and dislodged labyrinth, (c) parts of LPTR disc containing the fracture surface, (d) LPTR blades, and (e) lock and pin of LPTR blades retainer ring were sent to this laboratory for establishing the probable cause(s) of failure. Examination revealed that the damages to LPTR blades were mostly confined to the tip region except for one where the blade had fractured in the airfoil at one-third height from the blade root platform. Evidences suggested that the damages to the LPTR blades were caused due to tip rubbing with the turbine casing. Fractographic examination confirmed that the fracture in all the blades was by overload. None of the blades showed any signatures of progressive failure. The damages on the lock and pin of LPTR blades retainer ring were also found to be secondary in nature. A part of the labyrinth was retrieved from the damaged engine. It was found mangled and separated from the <b>labyrinth</b> support <b>ring</b> with the LP turbine disc. No pins were available with the labyrinth. The fractured ends of the labyrinth were severely damaged. Fractographic examination showed dimple rupture wherever the fracture features were preserved, indicating failure under overload. The <b>labyrinth</b> support <b>ring</b> got completely separated from the LP turbine disc. Again, only a part of this ring was available for examination. But, the entire mating fracture surface of the ring was available with the disc. Fracture surface analysis showed that separation of the <b>labyrinth</b> support <b>ring</b> from the disc was by overload fracture. The force acted on the support ring was in the radial direction from outside to inside. Further examination of the separated <b>labyrinth</b> support <b>ring</b> showed presence of cracks in four pin holes, located in a sector adjacent to each other. The cracks were located at the edge of the holes on the free surface. It was confirmed through scanning electron fractographic study that these cracks were progressive in nature and they had propagated by fatigue mechanism. From the laboratory investigation, it could not be established whether or not these cracks have bearing on the separation of the <b>labyrinth</b> support <b>ring</b> from LP turbine disc. The presence of fatigue cracks, however, does indicate some distress at the pin holes originating either from assembly or during engine run. Considering the overall damages to various components of the engine in and around LP turbine and the laboratory investigation, it appears that the failure in the labyrinth was due to some location specific problem(s). Analysis also suggests that the overload fracture of <b>labyrinth</b> support <b>ring</b> is indicative of sudden overload on this component during the engine run. Although it was not possible to establish as to what caused this sudden overload, it is believed that the detachment of <b>labyrinth</b> support <b>ring</b> was the first in the chain of events that led to engine failure. In view of this, it is suggested that various possibilities that could lead to sudden overload on the <b>labyrinth</b> support <b>ring</b> of the LP turbine disc be investigated. It also needs to be investigated whether or not there could be any common cause(s) which is responsible for generation of fatigue cracks at the pin holes as well as the separation of the <b>labyrinth</b> support <b>ring</b> from LP turbine disc. Laboratory test results showed that the materials used for fabrication of the components in question conform to specification in terms of chemical composition. No comments can be offered on the microstructure and hardness parameters because of the insufficient data made available to this laboratory. However, based on the overall understanding of the failure, any metallurgical abnormality leading to separation of the <b>labyrinth</b> support <b>ring</b> appears to be a remote possibility...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a new eddy-current flaw detector that operates with a pocket PC (PPC), the flaw detector meeting all present-day requirements set for means of NDT, particularly documentation of inspection results. The VD- 12 NFP eddy-current flaw detector {{is intended to}} reveal defects with the depth from 0. 5 mm on complex geometry surfaces and high roughness surfaces, up to Rz 320. Such surfaces are met with disks of railway wheels, coupler carriers, solebars, bolsters, <b>labyrinth</b> <b>rings,</b> sheaves, etc. The distinguishing feature of the device is the elimination of lift-off interference, up to 3 mm. The device is certified and widely used at locomotive facilities and carriage repair workshops of Ministry of Railways and other industries as well. Small dimensions, low weight and battery power supply allow the use of it in field conditions. The employment of a PPC broadens {{the application of the}} device, viz an operator gets the widest possibilities to store the results, their processing and information representation, including setting of the inspection parameters on the PPC display, marks on the signal graph and direct printing of reports from PPC. The use of a radio channel to transfer data lets us get rid of cables, provide high mobility of the complex and easily integrate the device into an automated inspection workbench. We have managed to substitutes the PPC display for the device display that also extends the possibilities of inspection and makes it easier for operators. When fastened to a wrist, the PPC does not restrict movements and allows inspection in hard-to-reach places due to its low weight and ergonomic casing...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} a novel {{behavior}} of solitary localized structures in a real Swift-Hohenberg equation subjected to a delayed feedback. We shall show that variation in {{the product of the}} delay time and the feedback strength leads to nontrivial instabilities resulting in the formation of oscillons, soliton <b>rings,</b> <b>labyrinth</b> patterns or moving structures. We provide a bifurcation analysis of the delayed system and derive a system of order parameter equations explicitly describing the temporal behavior of the localized structure {{in the vicinity of the}} bifurcation point. We demonstrate that a normal form of the bifurcation, responsible for the emergence of moving solitary structures can be obtained and show that spontaneous motion to the lowest order occurs without change of the shape...|$|R

We describe in detail the the LR and wire array characterization separately, and after that the combined experimental results, for NRM are reported. The LRs analytical and simulation study is not new but design in Ka band and different experimental procedure for the characterization of the negative refractive index is the novelty of this paper. For performing a negative refractive index experiment we made prism of 150 Prism angle. We get enhanced transmittance of more than 20 dB from background, at a negative angle of refraction. The values of the negative refractive index in a band of about 1 G Hz around 31 GHz are retrieved from the experimental data. Comment: 10 pages 8 figure...|$|E
