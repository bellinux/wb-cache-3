By measuring the change in transmission ratio in the ratiometric system, a change in displacement can be measured. The <b>displacement</b> <b>sensor</b> is sensitive to temperature and an experimental investigation of this sensitivity is presented. It is found that the peak shift response has a linear variation with temperature; therefore, temperature dependence can be mitigated by a suitable displacement correction process. The proposed macrobending fibre based <b>displacement</b> <b>sensor</b> benefits from simplicity and low cost and achieves a comparable resolution as compared with other conventional fibre optic sensors...|$|R
