40|$|Three {{different}} drugs (mefloquine, atovaquone/proguanil, doxycycline) {{are recommended}} for malaria chemoprophylaxis, each with {{approximately the same}} efficacy but various adverse event profiles, regimens, and prices. We investigated which medication the travelers would have chosen {{on the basis of}} written evidence-based information and the impact that pretravel consultation had on their decision. A prospective study was performed in a travel clinic and private practice, and 1073 travelers were included; 45 % chose mefloquine (<b>Lariam</b> or Mephaquine), 21 % atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone), 18 % doxycycline (Supracycline), 5 % "no prophylaxis," and 11 % "do not know. " <b>Lariam</b> was principally chosen because of prior experience (38 %), Mephaquine because of low price (34 %), and doxycycline and Malarone because of the profile of adverse events (55 % and 43 %, respectively). Based on objective written information, travelers most frequently chose mefloquine for chemoprophylaxis. This suggests that evidence-based information weighs more heavily than negative publicity.

40|$|BackgroundArtemisinin-based {{combination}} therapy (ACT) is recommended {{as a means}} of prolonging the effectiveness of first-line malaria treatment regimens. Different brands of mefloquine (MQ) have been reported to be non-bioequivalent; this could result in sub-therapeutic levels of mefloquine with decreased efficacy. In 2002, mefloquine-artesunate (MQ-AS) {{combination therapy}} was adopted as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in the Amazon region of Peru. Although MQ resistance has yet to be reported from the Peruvian Amazon, it has been reported from other countries in the Amazon Region. Therefore, continuous monitoring is warranted to ensure that the first-line therapy remains efficacious. This study examines the in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetic parameters through Day 56 of three commercial formulations of MQ (<b>Lariam</b> 2, Mephaquin 2, and Mefloquina-AC 2 Farma) given in combination with artesunate. MethodsThirty-nine non-pregnant adults with P. falciparum mono-infection were randomly assigned to receive artesunate in combination with either (1) <b>Lariam,</b> (2) Mephaquin, or (3) Mefloquina AC. Patients were assessed on Day 0 (with blood samples for pharmacokinetics at 0, 2, 4, and 8 hours), 1, 2, 3, 7, and then weekly until day 56. Clinical and parasitological outcomes were based on the standardized WHO protocol. ResultsBy day 3, all patients had cleared parasitaemia except for one patient in the AC Farma arm; this patient cleared by day 4. No recurrences of parasitaemia were seen in any of the 34 patients. All three MQ formulations had a terminal half-life of 1422 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 15 days and time to maximum plasma concentration of 4522 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 52 hours. The maximal concentration (Cmax) and interquartile range was 2, 820 ng/ml (2, 61422 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 3, 108) for <b>Lariam,</b> 2, 500 ng/ml (2, 36322 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2, 713) for Mephaquin, and 2, 750 ng/ml (2, 55022 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 3, 000) for Mefloquina AC Farma. The pharmacokinetics of the three formulations were generally similar, {{with the exception of the}} Cmax of Mephaquin which was significantly different to that of <b>Lariam</b> (p = 0. 04). ConclusionAll three formulations had similar pharmacokinetics; in addition, the pharmacokinetics seen in this Peruvian population were similar to reports from other ethnic groups. All patients rapidly cleared their parasitaemia with no evidence of recrudescence by Day 56. Continued surveillance is needed to ensure that patients continue to receive optimal therapy...|$|E
40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: Even {{though the}} {{important}} antimalaria drug rac-erythro-mefloquine HCl {{has been on}} the market as <b>Lariam</b> for decades, the absolute configurations of its enantiomers have not been determined conclusively. This is needed, since the (−) enantiomer is believed to cause adverse side effects in malaria treatment resulting from binding to the adenosine receptor in the human brain. Since there are conflicting assignments based on enantioselective synthesis and anomalous X-ray diffraction, we determined the absolute configuration using a combination of NMR, optical rotatory dispersion (ORD), and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy together with density functional theory calculations. First, structural models of erythro-mefloquine HCl compatible with NMR-derived 3 JHH scalar couplings, 15 N chemical shifts, rotational Overhauser effects, and residual dipolar couplings were constructed. Second, we calculated ORD and CD spectra of the structural models and compared the calculated data with the experimental values. The experimental results for (−) -erythro-mefloquine HCl matched our calculated chiroptical data for the 11 R, 12 S model. Accordingly, we conclude that the assignment of 11 R, 12 S to (−) -erythro-mefloquine HCl is correct. Notwithstanding its importance as an antimalaria agent, theabsolute configuration of neither (+) - nor (−) -erythro-mefloquine HCl has been solved conclusively to date.

40|$|Here {{we report}} the {{synthesis}} of all four stereoisomers of mefloquine. Mefloquine (<b>Lariam)</b> is an important anti-malaria drug that is applied as a racemate of the erythro form. However, the (-) -isomer induces psychosis, while the (+) -enantiomer does not have this undesired side effect. There are six syntheses of which five lead to the wrong enantiomer without the authors of these syntheses noting that they had synthesized the wrong compound. At the same time physical chemistry investigations had assigned the absolute configuration correctly and the last enantioselective synthesis that took these results into account delivered the correct absolute configuration. Since various synthetic approaches failed to provide the correct stereoisomers in previous syntheses, we submit here a synthetic approach with a domino Sonogashira- 6 -electrocyclisation as key step that confirmed synthetically the correct absolute configuration of all four isomers...|$|E
30|$|Mefloquine {{hydrochloride}} [dl-erythro-α-(- 2 -piperidyl)- 2, 8 -bis (trifluoromethyl)- 4 -quinolinemethanol], {{historically has}} been used as a prophylactic and treatment agent for malaria infection caused by Plasmodium falciparum (Nevin 2012 a; Magill 2006). Mefloquine was developed at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in the 1970 ’s and had been marketed under the trade name <b>Lariam,</b> among others (Nevin 2012 b). Due to its long half-life in the body (Yelmo et al. 2010), allowing for weekly rather than daily treatment, and its efficacy against chloroquine-resistant forms of the disease (Nevin 2012 b), mefloquine was employed widely among travelers to areas where malaria infection was likely (Nevin 2012 b; Petersen et al. 2000; van Riemsdijk et al. 1997, 2005; Phillips and Kass 1996) including members of the U.S. military deployed overseas to such areas as Iraq and Afghanistan (Nevin 2010; Peterson et al. 2011; Vuurman et al. 1996).|$|E

40|$|Prophylactic drug {{monitoring}} of mefloquine and its carboxylic acid metabolite were studied in two patients with {{end-stage renal disease}} undergoing long-term hemodialysis treatment. The patients, short-term travellers to areas where malaria is endemic, took 250 mg of mefloquine (<b>Lariam)</b> once weekly for 2 weeks before and during their 3 -week stay abroad and for one week after their return. Pre- and postdialysis blood samples were drawn before their departure and after their return. The concentration-time profiles of mefloquine and its metabolite in plasma samples taken {{before and after the}} 3 - to 4 -h dialysis sessions were similar. Mefloquine and its metabolite could not be detected in the dialysate. These findings show that mefloquine and its metabolite are not, or are very poorly, removed by hemodialysis. Concentrations in plasma and accumulation kinetics were similar to those reported for healthy volunteers and were associated with high prophylactic efficacy against malaria. No special dosage adjustments have to be made in patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment to achieve concentrations in plasma similar to those in healthy volunteers.

40|$|We {{have used}} the whole-cell patch-clamp {{technique}} to study the effect of mefloquine (<b>Lariam),</b> a commonly used antimalarial drug, on the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) in cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells. We also examined its effects on other Cl(-) channels, i. e., the Ca(2 +) -activated Cl(-) channel and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, to assess the specificity of this compound for VRAC. At pH 7. 4 mefloquine induced a fast and reversible block of the volume-sensitive chloride current (I(Cl,swell)), with an IC(50) value of 1. 19 +/- 0. 07 microM. The blocking efficiency increased with increasing extracellular pH (IC(50) value for pH 8. 8 was 0. 15 +/- 0. 01 microM), indicating that this effect is mediated by the uncharged form of mefloquine. Ca(2 +) -activated Cl(-) currents, I(Cl,Ca), activated by loading T 84 cells via the patch pipette with 1 microM free Ca(2 +) also were inhibited by mefloquine (IC(50) value 3. 01 +/- 0. 17 microM at pH 7. 4). The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channel, transiently transfected in cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells, was not affected by 10 microM of the drug. This study describes {{for the first time}} effects of mefloquine on anion channels. Our data reveal a potent block of VRAC and Ca(2 +) -activated Cl(-) channel at therapeutic concentrations.
