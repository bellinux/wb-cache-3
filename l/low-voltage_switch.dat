40|$|The {{objective}} of the Master Thesis has been to {{provide an overview of}} the radioactive sources and Electromagnetic fields (EMF), existing on offshore petroleum installations from the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS). It has also been of interest to describe how offshore workers handle these radiation sources, which are the associated health hazards and which are the most efficient protection measures against exposure. The report contains a literature research of the most recent national and international publications relevant for the topic; a collection of interesting data from the literature study, from the interviews of various experts within Health, Safety and Environment, and from a workshop where the participants have shared their personal experiences with radiation protection offshore. Moreover, the literature research also provides an overview of important radiation concepts, of measuring units used in the assessment of exposure, of statutory requirements and means of identifying and prioritising protection measures. The thesis is accompanied by two digital databases that have been created in conjunction with the data collection realised. One of the databases provides the mapping of radioactive sources used in the offshore petroleum industry, while the other one includes a similar mapping for the EMF. Both of the databases contain significant information from the literature study and from the workshop attended about: the properties of almost 40 mapped radiation sources, efficient protection measures and interesting practical experiences. Moreover, the databases have been sent to experts for quality assurance and new inputs. Furthermore, the results from the data collection have been thoroughly discussed in order to highlight the most critical radiation sources on the NCS and efficient barriers against exposure. The results show that among the most hazardous radioactive sources on the NCS there are: industrial radiography, well logging by use of neutron and gamma radiation, installed gauges, &# 145;intelligent pigs&# 146;, radiotracers, as well as the natural occurring radioactive material (NORM) formed in gas and oil equipment. EMF are divided into: Static magnetic fields (SMF), Extremely low frequency electric and magnetic fields (ELF) and Radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF). Among the most important sources of ELF, there are: generators, low and high voltage transformers, <b>low-voltage</b> <b>switch</b> gear room, the drive space, as well as power supply cables to or from the shore. RF sources highlighted in the studied literature and by experts are: the X-band and S-band maritime radars and the Radio Link communication antennas, while strong SMF are generated by powerful electric motors. Protection measures against exposure to radioactive sources are based on restricting as much as possible the total dose people receive throughout their lives and thus, the likelihood of developing cancer and genetic damages. Most of the barriers are related to radiation protection principles like: maximising the distance from the radiation source (radiation doses decrease rapidly with the square of the distance), minimising the exposure time and shielding the source. Moreover it is particularly important to avoid inhaling or ingesting radioactive material, such as NORM dust. Barriers against exposure to ELF are mainly based on avoiding acute biological effects, such as the excitation of muscle and nerve cells, with possible but nevertheless, uncertain impact on e. g. the development of Alzheimer&# 146;s. Protection measures are also aimed at avoiding health effects such as the increased risk for leukaemia caused by long term exposures to high magnetic fields. A possible long term biological effect of strong SMF, is their impact on the expression of certain genes, primarily in mammalian cells. Most of the barriers against exposure to ELF and SMF are based on the radiation protection principles of maximising the distance from the source and minimising the exposure time, since the level of exposure to EMF decrease also with the square of the distance. Strong magnetic fields are normally difficult to shield. Protection measures against exposure to RF are related to biological effects such as tissue damages after a temperature increase in the body of 1 - 2 oC, caused by extremely high exposure levels. There are several hypotheses about the RF&# 146;s exact short term and long term health effects but none of them is well established. Thus, most of the barriers are based on a precautionary strategy, and they are primarily related to the principle of minimising the exposure time to avoid tissue heating, maximising the distance from the source, and to design solutions such as directing the transmission of antennas away from manned areas. Radiation protection is a wide subject, thus, there are many possible recommendations one could give with respect to efficient protective measures. One strategy that applies for both radioactive sources and for EMF is: to use radiation sources only if they are justified and to restrict the exposure levels as much as reasonably achievable. Apart from keeping in mind these three factors: distance, time and shielding against the radiation source, one should always make sure that workers have adequate training and that there is maintained a good level of communication, experience exchange and risk awareness within the organisation and across the industry. Moreover, priority should be given to design and organisational barriers at the source and the use of personal protective equipment must be always considered as a last resort. </p...|$|E

40|$|Advanced radio {{technology}} demands for {{low power consumption}} and compact architecture that operate at the global range of frequency standards. Using discrete components based on traditional surface acoustic wave (SAW) or thin film bulk acoustic resonator (TFBAR) technology to manufacture quad-band and 7 -band radios presently requires {{an enormous number of}} power-hungry and large-size filters fabricated on different substrates. On the other hand, employment of Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) technology to create radio front-ends facilitates reductions in size, weight, cost, and power in radio communications. Several research groups from academia and industry have recently demonstrated electrostatically and ferroelectrically transduced microelectromechanical resonators and filters that operate at high frequency and exhibit low insertion loss as potential substitutes for conventional quartz and ceramic devices. However, the modern radio architecture today also requires the ability to discern bandwidths between 0. 1 MHz and 5 MHz. This requires frequency-agile intermediate-frequency filters, generating a strong demand for narrow-bandwidth channel-select filters with very high quality factors (Q), which can be formed using high-Q MEMS resonators. This dissertation presents {{the state of the art}} transduction mechanisms of MEMS resonators and filters with key innovations in DC voltage tuning schemes, packaging technology and system integration. Electrically coupled, high-Q, tunable channel-select ladder filters comprised of dielectrically transduced thickness shear mode resonators are presented using integrated circuit compatible bulk micromachining technology. The ladder filter consists of shunt and series resonators operating in the half-wave thickness shear vibration mode. Each constituent resonator of the filter can be excited at above 810 MHz resonant frequency with Q of 7, 800 in air and a motional impedance (RX) of 59 Omega. The ladder filter demonstrates a center frequency tuning range of 8 MHz at 817 MHz and an adjustable bandwidth from 600 kHz to 2. 8 MHz, while maintaining an insertion loss less than 4 dB, stop-band rejection greater than 30 dB and pass-band ripple less than 2 dB. By having a tunability feature, radio frequency (RF) MEMS filters can accommodate various signal waveforms with bandwidth range of 0. 1 MHz and 5 MHz. In addition, errors due to fabrication can be compensated and capacitive loading in receiver architecture can be minimized. Multi-frequency and multi-band filters on-chip has motivated the design and fabrication of a center frequency and bandwidth tunable RF MEMS filter using a series-coupled array of dielectrically-transduced square-extensional contour mode resonators. The proposed digital tuning scheme provides channel-agility and bandwidth granularity for analog spectral processors and RF spectrum analyzers. A 512 MHz overtone square-extensional mode resonator is demonstrated with a Q of 1, 800 in air and RX of 3. 1 k-Omega. An array of four such resonators is coupled mechanically to form a channel-select filter with 1. 4 MHz bandwidth at 509 MHz center frequency. By switching the DC-biasing scheme, the filter is split into narrower high and low sub-bands, each 700 kHz wide. Despite of the advances in device performance, packaging technology for MEMS resonators and filters remains a critical challenge. Because of the extreme sensitivity to environment, MEMS resonators and filters need a good vacuum encapsulation technology. The promising on-chip applications also require a CMOS compatible packaging process. The first successful combination of a dielectricallytransduced 200 MHz width-extensional contour mode resonator with the epi-silicon encapsulation process is demonstrated. The fabricated encapsulated-resonator exhibits a resonant frequency of 207 MHz and a Q of 6, 400. The high f x Q(1. 2 x 10 exp(12) Hz) makes this encapsulated resonator an excellent candidate for applications in local oscillators for RF front-ends and frequency references. Dielectric transduction is not only limited to solid dielectric transduction. Lateral contour-mode resonators in which the transduction gaps are filled with a liquid dielectric having much higher permittivity than air are presented. Aqueous transduction is more efficient than air-gap transduction and has a higher frequency tuning range compared to solid dielectric transduction. A 42 MHz poly-SiGe disk resonator with de-ionized (DI) water confined to the electrode gaps is demonstrated. The resonator has a measured Q of 3, 800, RX of 3. 9 k-Omega and 3 % series frequency tuning range. Ferroelectric materials like lead zirconate titanate (PZT) is of interest because it offers a large electromechanical coupling coefficient (k sub(t) exp(2)) and electric field dependent permittivity and modulus of elasticity. In this effort, PZT transduced resonators with the same lateral dimensions are designed and fabricated with and without a silicon device layer to explore the insertion loss, linearity, tunability and Q trade-offs between the two types of resonators. A novel air-bridge fabrication technology is developed to minimize the pad capacitances and enables the frequency excitation of PZT transduced resonators above 1. 8 GHz. PZT transduced fully-differential filters are designed by mechanically coupling two high-overtone width-extensional mode resonators. The fully-differential filter configuration cancels the feed-through capacitance and improves the stop-band floor of the filter. The demonstrated electric field tuning provides channel-agility and bandwidth adjustability for incorporation of analog spectral processors in state of the art radio receiver architectures. The filter demonstrates a center frequency tuning range of 7 MHz at 260 MHz and an adjustable bandwidth from 3 MHz to 6. 3 MHz, while maintaining a maximum frequency shift due to hysteresis effects below 0. 14 % and a stop-band rejection floor of - 60 dB. In order to improve immunity to hysteresis and realize the narrow bandwidth channel-select filter, the PZT transduced fully-differential filters are integrated with silicon device layer. A 206. 3 MHz high-overtone width-extensional filter is demonstrated with 653 kHz bandwidth, - 25 dB insertion loss and - 62 dB stop-band rejection in air. Uncompensated temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) of - 16 ppm/degrees C and third-order input intercept point (IIP 3) of + 29 dBm are demonstrated by the filter. The monolithic integration of RF components has long been a goal of researchers and will enable not only more compact and lower cost systems but previously unachievable signal processing functions. This dissertation provides the first experimental demonstration of monolithically integrated piezoelectric RF MEMS switches with contour mode filters. PZT thin films are utilized to enable both <b>low-voltage</b> <b>switch</b> operation and filter tunability.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of three-dimensional (3 D) device architectures like Fin FETs and nanowire-based transistors {{as well as}} novel materials is inevit able in order to sustain scaling and continuous performance improvement in future technology nodes. However, the controlled doping of 3 D structu res represents still a major challenge, also since adequate metrology to ols for 2 D and preferably 3 D active dopant profiling in confined volumes with high spatial resolution is lagging behind. The objective of this thesis work was therefore to establish a character ization technique capable of mapping the distribution of active dopants in confined volumes such as nanowire-based transistors. Given the string ent requirements such as high spatial resolution and sensitivity arising from the properties inherent to confined nanoscale structures, we chose scanning spreading resistance microscopy (SSRM) and extended its capabi lities to facilitate 2 D and 3 D quantitative carrier profiling in future 3 D device structures. Applying our methodology to nanowire-based tunnel-field-effect transisto rs (TFET) enabled us to study and model dopant incorporation, diffusion and activation kinetics in confined nanoscale volumes in detail. Thereby the latter mechanisms could be revealed as significantly different from their counterparts in blanket structures. The substantially increased s urface-to-volume ratio of 3 D structures {{has been identified as}} the main cause for the observed deviations. Moreover, the impact of the detected size-dependent dopant profiles on the actual device characteristics was demonstrated experimentally and by device simulations. In order to extend SSRM towards quantitative carrier profiling in aggres sively scaled structures, we furthermore developed a novel electrical AF M mode, termed fast Fourier transform-SSRM (FFT-SSRM). This technique ai ms at decoupling the actual spreading resistance from parasitic series r esistances. For this purpose the force applied to the scanning probe is modulated, leading to a modulation of the contact size and therefore of the spreading resistance, whereas parasitic series resistances (e. g. the bulk resistance of the structure) remain constant. Hence, information o n the spreading resistance and therefore the carrier concentration can b e extracted using lock-in technique, even in situations where the measur ed resistance is dominated by series resistance terms. For the 3 D electrical characterization of carbon nanotube (CNT) -based in terconnects we established a dedicated slice-and-view approach. Thereby not only the data acquisition, but also successive material removal is a chieved by means of the scanning probe. From the obtained 3 D resistance maps, the resistivity of individual CNTs as well as the contact resistan ce between CNT and bottom electrode can be quantitatively determined. Th e latter are considered important parameters for the fabrication and int egration of CNTs in future integrated circuits. Our results demonstrate the enormous potential of 3 D analysis using SSRM for gaining fundamental insights into the electrical properties of nano scale confined structures. This constitutes an essential milestone on th e roadmap towards future nanoelectronic devices.

This paper uses high speed optical arc imaging to investigate arc motion in a LVSD as the vent aperture conditions are varied.

40|$|As Si-CMOS scaling is {{predicted}} to reach fundamental physical limits in the next 10 years, there is an immediate need to explore and develop alternate devices/switches, which {{will enable us to}} continue the design of energy efficient, high-performance and scalable systems. Devices based on electron spin have gained prominence in the past decade due to almost zero standby-leakage, making them very suitable for memory implementation. On the other hand, for logic, electron spin based implementations can be promising due to the possibility of having <b>low-voltage</b> <b>switches</b> and enhanced functionality logic gates, leading to significant power savings. The primary focus of this research is to explore scalability, power consumption, and speed, from Atoms to Systems, considering electron spin as the alternate state variable for both logic and memory. In order to do that we have investigated self-consistent atomistic simulation framework for spin based devices based on Non-Equilibrium Green 2 ̆ 7 s Function (NEGF) formalism and Four Component Spin Transport model for spin-transport and Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation for magnet dynamics. Circuit and architecture level analysis are based on the device performance obtained using the proposed framework. Specifically, we have explored spin-transfer torque (STT) based 1 T- 1 R bit-cell and domain wall memories (DWM) using nanomagnetic strips. For 1 T- 1 R memory, four different bit-cells are systematically studied from embedded memory applications. On the other hand, for DWM, experimentally benchmarked model was used to optimize memory structure for readability, writabiity, stability and scalability through material and geometrical parameters. From logic design perspective, we have explored three types of spin-torque devices, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. Finally, a non-Boolean logic implementation framework using spin-based logic devices was developed to design circuits optimized for ultra-low power and high performance. ...|$|R
