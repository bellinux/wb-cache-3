25|$|Michael Parkinson always sought guests who, {{besides being}} well known, {{had some sort}} of story to relate. He then saw his job as {{allowing}} them to tell it and did so by being open, relaxed and attentive. (He learnt very early on that in order to be an adept interviewer, he had to be a good listener.) He researched his subjects thoroughly, and, in the early shows, always had his <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> to hand. Having guided them to an area of discussion, he rarely interrupted his guests — except to provide the occasional prompt — instead letting them expand on a particular topic. Sometimes, a person would warm to this style with unpredictable results. For example, he regards his chats with Shirley MacLaine as bordering on flirtatious. In his final programme, broadcast 22 December 2007, Parkinson stated that one of his most memorable interviews was with Jacob Bronowski in 1973.|$|E
25|$|To {{design the}} {{memorial}} on the slightly restricted site, the memorial foundation held a design competition. On November 11, 2002, the DVLMF invited about 20 architects and landscape architects to submit design proposals for the memorial. Six firms {{responded with a}} proposal. The DVLMF established a nine-member design committee consisting {{of members of the}} foundation's Board of Directors as well as noted architects, artists, and landscape architects. In February 2003, the six proposals were presented anonymously to the design committee. Two firms, Michael Vergason Landscape Architects and Nelson Byrd Woltz Landscape Architects, were asked to submit a refined proposal. This second proposal included, among other things, cost estimates, a project schedule, and a scale model. The design committee submitted a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> to each firm, and asked them to address the questions in their second submission. Each firm was also asked to discuss possible design alternatives. In July 2003, the design committee selected Michael Vergason Landscape Architects as the memorial designer. The DVLMF Board of Directors affirmed the choice.|$|E
500|$|Cotton's written legacy {{includes}} {{a large body}} of correspondence, numerous sermons, a catechism, and a shorter catechism for children titled Spiritual Milk for Boston Babes.

[...] This catechism was published in 1646 and went through nine printings in the 17th century. It is composed of a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> with answers. [...] Cotton's grandson Cotton Mather wrote, [...] "the children of New England are to this day most usually fed with his excellent catechism".

50|$|The form of {{education}} varied, though the earliest recorded methods were <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> and answers (Catechism). Sermons were also used (Cyril of Jerusalem).

There were certain differences between catechisms for the young baptized and for the unbaptized catechumen.|$|R
500|$|Disgruntled Protestant {{politicians}} and noblemen were {{in contact with}} Mary's husband as early as 1686. After James took the step of forcing Anglican clergymen to read the Declaration of Indulgence—the proclamation granting religious liberty to Catholics and dissenters—from their churches in May 1688, his popularity plunged further. Alarm amongst Protestants increased when his wife, Mary of Modena, {{gave birth to a}} son—James Francis Edward—in June 1688, for the son would, unlike Mary and Anne, be raised a Roman Catholic. Some charged that the boy was [...] "supposititious", having been secretly smuggled into the Queen's room in a bed-warming pan as a substitute for her stillborn baby. Seeking information, Mary sent a pointed <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> to her sister, Anne, regarding the circumstances of the birth. Anne's reply, and continued gossip, seemed to confirm Mary's suspicions that the child was not her natural brother, and that her father was conspiring to secure a Catholic succession.|$|E

[...] Fawkes was transferred to the Tower of London. [...] The King composed a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> to be put to [...] "Johnson", such as [...] "as to what he is, For I can never yet hear of any man that knows him", [...] "When and where he learned to speak French?", and [...] "If he was a Papist, who brought him up in it?"

[...] One concerned William and Fanny's marital status, prompting Kent {{to admit that they}} never married. [...] Moore told him he did not think he was a murderer, rather, he believed the spirit's presence indicated that [...] "there was something behind darker than all the rest, and that if he would go to Parson's house, he might be a witness to the same and convinced of its reality". [...] On 12January therefore, Kent enlisted the aid of the two physicians who attended Fanny in her last days, and with Broughton, went to Cock Lane. [...] On the house's upper floor Elizabeth Parsons was publicly undressed, and with her younger sister was put to bed. [...] The audience sat around the bed, positioned in the centre of the room. [...] They were warned that the ghost was sensitive to disbelief and told that they should accord it due respect. [...] When the séance began, a relative of Parsons, Mary Frazer, ran around the room shouting [...] "Fanny, Fanny, why don't you come? [...] Do come, pray Fanny, come; dear Fanny, come!" [...] When nothing happened, Moore told the group the ghost would not come as they were making too much noise. [...] He asked them to leave the room, telling them he would try to contact the ghost by stamping his foot. [...] About ten minutes later they were told the ghost had returned and that they should re-enter the room. [...] Moore then started to run through his and Parsons' list of questions: ...|$|E
