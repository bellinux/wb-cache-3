40|$|Abstract. In this work, a new damage {{model for}} mixed-mode {{fracture}} in {{the scope of}} the discrete crack approach is introduced. An energy-based internal damage variable is adopted. In the model, deformation-driven <b>loading</b> <b>surfaces</b> are defined and the dual <b>loading</b> <b>surfaces</b> in the traction space are derived. Under proportional loading, it is found that the constitutive relationship is symmetric. Further enrichment of the energy-based variable on the traction field is also introduced, allowing for a better approximation of: i) the limit surface defined in traction space and ii) non-proportional loading. However, in this case symmetry of the constitutive tensor is lost...|$|R
40|$|Vibration-based {{method has}} been widely applied for damage {{identification}} of bridge. Natural frequency, mode shape, and their derivatives are sensitive parameters to damage. However, these parameters can be affected {{not only by the}} health of structure, but also by the changing temperature. It is essential to eliminate the influence of temperature in practice. Therefore, a fuzzy neural network-based damage assessment method is proposed in this paper. Uniform <b>load</b> <b>surface</b> curvature is used as damage indicator. Elasticity modulus of concrete is assumed to be temperature dependent in the numerical simulation of bridge model. Through selecting temperature and uniform <b>load</b> <b>surface</b> curvature as input variables of fuzzy neural network, the algorithm can distinguish the damage from temperature effect. Comparative analysis between fuzzy neural network and BP network illustrates the superiority of the proposed method...|$|R
50|$|A new 1100 {{body style}} was {{introduced}} at the 1954 Geneva Motor show, a 5-door estate named 1100 Familiare on its home market. Abroad it was alternatively {{known as the}} 1100 Family, 110 Familiale, 1100 Kombiwagen or 1100 Familiar in English-, French- German-, and Spanish-speaking markets respectively.The rear door was side-hinged, and the vinyl-covered rear bench could be folded down to form a flat <b>loading</b> <b>surface,</b> able to carry a load of 300 kg. A third row of two forward-facing jump seats allowed to carry a fifth and sixth passenger, folding level with the boot floor when not in use.

5000|$|The 500 Giardiniera (500 K on some markets) estate {{version of}} the Fiat 500 is the longest running model. The engine is laid under {{the floor of the}} boot to create a flat <b>loading</b> <b>surface.</b> The roof on this model also {{stretches}} {{all the way to the}} rear, not stopping above the driver and front passenger as it does in other models of the same period. The Giardiniera also features [...] "suicide doors" [...] and was the only model to continue to use this door type into the 1970s. In 1966 production was transferred to Desio where the Giardiniera was built by Fiat subsidiary Autobianchi. A total of 327,000 Giardinieras were produced, later examples having Autobianchi rather than Fiat badging.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} sizes of trees {{commonly found in}} saddles. Trees differ in the width of gullet and bars of the saddle, pitch of the bars (steep to flat, usually between an angle of 86 to 94 degrees with 90 being common), and length of the bars. The tree also influences {{the shape of the}} pommel and cantle on the seat on the saddle, though the seat can be altered to fit a rider by adding padding and other materials to a far greater degree than the fit of the saddle tree's bars on a horse. A wider gullet sits lower on the horse, while a narrow gullet sits higher and is designed to fit horses with higher withers. The bars form the primary <b>loading</b> <b>surface</b> of the saddle as it site on the horse's back. A horse with a flat back and widely sprung ribs will require bars with a flatter pitch than a saddle made for a narrow horse, where a steeper pitch to the bars will keep the saddle placed properly. Most saddles are made with pre-manufactured trees which come in a limited range of sizes. Custom-made saddles may be able to have further alterations made to a standard tree.|$|E

40|$|This paper focusses on the {{influence}} of the deviatoric shape of the employed <b>loading</b> <b>surface</b> on the predicted failure of concrete. For this purpose, the Extended Leon Model (ELM) [1] and a multi-surface model are considered. The multi-surface model consists of three Rankine surfaces and the Drucker–Prager surface. Whereas the Drucker–Prager surface is characterized by a circular shape in the deviatoric plane, the ELM accounts for the dependence of the strength of concrete on the Lode angle. It is characterized by an elliptic <b>loading</b> <b>surface</b> in the deviatoric plane. The eccentricity e defines the out-off-roundness. It allows a smooth transition from a circular (e= 1) to an almost triangular shape (e≈ 0. 5) of the <b>loading</b> <b>surface</b> in the deviatoric plane. The significance of the deviatoric shape of the <b>loading</b> <b>surface</b> on the predicted peak load and failure mode of concrete structures is investigated by means of two example problems: a plane-strain compression test characterized by compressive failure and an anchor-bolt test characterized by shear failure...|$|E

To determine the parameters of the initial yield surface and the fracture surface, the Pisarenko-Lebedev criterion for structurally inhomogeneous materials is used. The procedure for describing the <b>loading</b> <b>surface</b> evolution during the active deformation {{is proposed}} for plastic strain paths of small curvature, or sufficiently close to them, based on the basic tension, compression and pure-shear experiments. The normalized plastic strain intensity is used as a deformation measure. ???????????? ??????????? ?????????? ??????????? ?????????, ??????? ?? ??????? ?????????????? ?????????? ? ??????. ??????????????, ??? ??????????? ? ?????? ????????????? ??????? ????????? ? ????????? ???????????? ?????????, ? ? ?????????? ??????, ??? ?????????? ? ? ???????????? ??????????. ??? ??????????? ?? ?????????? ???????????? ?????????? ???????? ?????????-???????? ??? ??????????-???????????? ??????????. ? ???????? ???? ???????? ?????????????? ???????????? ????????????? ????????????? ???????????? ??????????. ?????????? ???????? ???????? ???????? ??????????? ?????????? ??? ???????? ??????? ?????????????? ?? ?????? ??????? ?????? ?? ??????????, ?????? ? ?????? ?????...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: As the {{saturated}} sand {{is distributed}} widely, many scholars have researched the consolidation compression of saturated sand. But {{most of the}} numerical research methods are based on continuous medium hypothesis, which are difficult to reveal the interaction rule between the sand and water. Here the sand particles and fluid flow coupling is studied by the particle flow code (PFC). The fixed coarse-grid fluid scheme is implemented in PFC for fluid coupling simulation. The scheme solves the continuity and Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations numerically in Eulerian Cartesian coordinates. In the coupling process, void ration, permeation factor and compression factor are changing. The result shows that the compression of the layer near the <b>load</b> <b>surface</b> is larger {{than that of the}} layer far away from the <b>load</b> <b>surface.</b> The excess pore pressure is not only caused by the load, but also influenced by the locale deformation of the sand. The deformation and excess pore pressure dissipation process are much different while the load rate changed...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{the fact}} that for an {{isotropic}} material model the elastic predictor and the projected stress tensors have the same eigenvectors, it is shown that the scalar damage can be obtained directly from the projection algorithm. This eliminates the difficulty of a proper definition of equivalent strain which serves as a driving force for evolution of damage in concrete. Moreover, if eigenvectors are known it is not more nec-essary to use invariants of the stress tensor for the formulation of <b>loading</b> <b>surface.</b> In the present model the <b>loading</b> <b>surface</b> is represented in the polynomial form.

40|$|In this study, a set {{of rules}} is established, which when {{implemented}} in the modeling of dilatant soils, within the framework of associative plasticity, enables very successful shear and dilatancy predictions. The proposed approach is based on a number of principles, the most important of which are: (1) The plasticity model must have a <b>loading</b> <b>surface</b> that hardens kinematically, and a failure surface that is perfectly plastic. (2) Experimental evidence shows that uniformly deformed sand samples dilate with a constant rate when they reach their ultimate strength value, while critical state is only achieved at very large strains. There is a unique point A on the <b>loading</b> <b>surface</b> that corresponds to the experimentally observed dilatation rate. The hardening rule must, therefore, ensure that the stress point approaches A as it approaches the failure surface.

The agreement between experimental data and theoretical predictions is excellent...|$|E
