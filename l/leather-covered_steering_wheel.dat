25|$|The 1988 Chevrolet Nova added a sporty {{model to}} its lineup of subcompact {{front-wheel-drive}} cars. This new 1988 Chevrolet Nova Twin-Cam {{got its name}} from a double-overhead-cam version of the Toyota-built 1.6-liter four-cylinder. Novas continued to share their basic design with the Corolla, and this engine had previously {{been used in the}} Toyota FX-16, a performance version of the Corolla. The twin-cam produced , 36 more than its single-cam sibling. A five-speed manual transmission was standard, as in the regular Novas, but the Twin-Cam offered a four-speed automatic as an option versus the three-speed offered on other models. The more potent engine elevated the 1988 Chevrolet Nova Twin-Cam into junior sport-sedan territory, but the advancement didn't come cheaply. The base Nova listed at about $8,800, the Twin-Cam went for $11,395. That price included fuel injection, sport suspension, power steering, <b>leather-covered</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> tachometer, four-wheel disc brakes, and wider tires on aluminum wheels, but it was a stiff tariff, and few were ordered (approximately 3,300 Twin-Cam models were built). There were no color choices; all 1988 Chevrolet Nova Twin-Cams wore black metallic paint with a grey interior; and there was no hatchback version offered. Every 1988 Chevrolet Nova got rear shoulder belts, rear window defogger, and AM/FM stereo radio as standard equipment. This was the last model year for the Nova name at Chevrolet. Starting with 1989, Chevrolet pushed this car into its new Geo division and renamed it the Prizm. Geo was Chevy's effort {{to come up with an}} import-sounding label to attract buyers who were not inclined to shop American.|$|E
2500|$|At a {{media event}} on February 28, 2011, Holden {{unveiled}} the Australian assembled Cruze sedan in facelifted [...] "Series II" [...] guise, {{otherwise known as}} the JH series. Prime Minister Julia Gillard attended the February launch to drive the first example off Holden's production line before full-scale production commenced in March. Holden has confirmed an initial local content level of between 40 and 50percent if assessed by retail value, with an aim of increasing Cruze localization over time. Series II styling revisions to the grille, lower air intake, and bumper have softened the front-end to bear a closer resemblance to Holden's larger VE II Commodore. Further differentiation from the original has been achieved via the fitment of amber front indicator lights, jewelled bezel headlamps, remodelled wheel trims, and through adjustments to the lower portion of the rear bumper. Carrying over largely unchanged is the 1.8-liter petrol inline-four, tweaked to yield slight enhancements in drivability. When automatic transmission is specified, the 1.8-liter is now teamed with GM's six-speed 6T30 unit, lighter and more compact than the previous 6T40. Diesel remains optional for [...] "CD" [...] and [...] "CDX" [...] specifications over the standard 1.8-liter petrol. Alterations to the 2.0-liter turbodiesel have resulted in an additional [...] and [...] and a slight reduction in fuel consumption for the manual variant, now a six-speed unit. However, the headline change is {{the release of the}} turbocharged 1.4-liter engine, dubbed iTi by Holden for intelligent turbo induction. The inclusion of the 1.4 also brings an upgrade to electric (as opposed to hydraulic) power steering and affixes a Watt's linkage to the torsion beam rear suspension. Linked with six-speed manual or automatic transmissions, the 1.4 is fitted as standard to the new [...] "SRi" [...] and [...] "SRi-V" [...] sports-oriented trims, but is available at extra cost on the base [...] "CD". The new [...] "SRi" [...] and [...] "SRi-V" [...] models have their respective badges embossed onto the grille insert, are fitted with their own front bumper design, and feature side skirts, chrome exterior door handles, a rear lip spoiler, and five-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels. Over the [...] "CD", [...] "SRi" [...] gains a <b>leather-covered</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> rim and shift lever, with the [...] "SRi-V" [...] extending this upholstering to the seating. A heat function for the front seats, keyless entry with push-button engine start, reversing sensors, and seven-inch LCD multimedia unit are also part of the [...] "SRi-V" [...] equipment list. This multimedia system integrates satellite navigation, the CD and DVD players, and a 10GB internal hard disk drive. In mid-November 2011, Holden released the MY12 update to the Series II Cruze. This update coincided with the release of the hatchback body variant and saw Bluetooth telephone connectivity standard across the range.|$|E

(The 2-Litre was advertised by Triumph as [...] "The Two Seater Beater"). The performance increase was welcome, but it highlighted the deficiencies of the rear suspension. Other detail modifications for the 2-litre, included a stronger clutch, all synchromesh gearbox, larger front brakes (still without a servo), and a stronger differential with a slightly higher 3.89:1 ratio. Wider & stronger 4.5-inch wheel rims were fitted, but radial-ply tyres were still optional, at extra cost.
