5|$|Marie Krøyer (1867–1940) {{came from}} an {{affluent}} German family who had moved to Copenhagen. From an early age she aspired to become an artist and after private training she went to study in Paris where Krøyer began to court her. It is believed Marie was subsequently reluctant to paint as she <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to Krøyer as a far more accomplished artist. A few of her works have nevertheless survived.|$|E

He was raised in Ashcroft, British Columbia, and began playing ice hockey in the Ashcroft Minor Hockey program. When he was fourteen, {{his family moved to}} Kamloops, British Columbia, where he {{attended}} junior and senior high school. Brewer excelled with the Kamloops Bantam AAA Jardine Blazers of the British Columbia Amateur Hockey Association (BCAHA). In 1995, Brewer was exposed to BCAHA Best Ever, a program designed to find and develop players and coaches for play in international competition. As a young hockey player, Brewer <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to NHL stars Scott Niedermayer and Jeremy Roenick as role models.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, Ohno is {{credited}} with popularizing and being {{the face of his}} sport. He said it is amazing being a role model to younger skaters. Growing up, he did not have that influence within his sport, but <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to other athletes outside his sport, such as Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, and Lance Armstrong. Training for short track has been the main focus of Ohno's life, but {{he has been able to}} work on other endeavors. He studied business at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.|$|E
5|$|The I Ching uses {{a type of}} divination called cleromancy, which {{produces}} apparently random numbers. Six numbers between 6 and 9 are turned into a hexagram, which can then be <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> in the I Ching book, arranged in an order known as the King Wen sequence. The interpretation of the readings found in the I Ching {{is a matter of}} centuries of debate, and many commentators have used the book symbolically, often to provide guidance for moral decision making as informed by Taoism and Confucianism. The hexagrams themselves have often acquired cosmological significance and paralleled with many other traditional names for the processes of change such as yin and yang and Wu Xing.|$|E

5|$|Wiggins {{was born}} in Los Angeles, California. His mother, Karla Wiggins, raised him as a single parent. He played {{baseball}} with his friends at a park across from the Rose Bowl. As a child, Wiggins was {{a fan of the}} Los Angeles Dodgers, and he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to Maury Wills, a Dodgers player known for stealing bases. Wiggins graduated from John Muir High School in Pasadena, California; the school was also the alma mater of baseball star Jackie Robinson. Gib Bodet, a scout for the Montreal Expos, noticed Wiggins in high school. Wiggins was , taller than a typical infielder. He was only an average hitter and fielder, but his speed stood out to Bodet.|$|E
5|$|Acton was {{supplanted by}} the most famous English cookery book of the Victorian era, Isabella Beeton's Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, 1861, which sold nearly two million copies up to 1868. Where Acton's was a book to be read and enjoyed, Beeton's, {{substantially}} written in later editions by other hands, was a manual of instructions and recipes, to be <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> as needed. Mrs Beeton was substantially plagiarized from authors including Elizabeth Raffald and Acton. The Anglo-Italian cook Charles Elmé Francatelli became a celebrity, cooking {{for a series of}} aristocrats, London clubs, and royalty including Queen Victoria. His 1846 book The Modern Cook ran through 29 editions by 1896, popularising an elaborate cuisine described throughout with French terminology, and offering bills of fare for up to 300 people.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal began brightly {{in front}} of a crowd of 65,483, {{creating}} the first chance of the match in the 17th minute. Paul Davis set up striker Kevin Campbell, who hooked the ball high over goal. Four minutes later, Alan Smith headed the ball into the goal net, meeting a cross from Paul Merson; it was ruled out by referee Terry Holbrook for offside. Tottenham improved shortly after, with Gary Mabbutt heading the ball directly at Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman to create their first chance of the match. Their best opportunity to score was in the 36th minute. Vinny Samways set up Gary Lineker to break past the Arsenal defence. Having nudged the ball past Tony Adams, Lineker <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> before making a cross for Nayim to head; the shot was acrobatically saved by Seaman's right foot.|$|E

5|$|Bowman {{was born}} in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and was raised in Littleton, Colorado, after his family moved in the early 1990s. His father, Mark Bowman, owns a {{financial}} consulting company in Colorado. His younger brother, Collin, is also a hockey player {{and went on to}} also compete in the Western Hockey League with the Kelowna Rockets, Moose Jaw Warriors and Calgary Hitmen. While in Littleton, Bowman attended Deer Creek Middle School. As a Colorado Avalanche fan, he has listed Joe Sakic as a player he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to. In 2003, he and his family moved once more to Vancouver, British Columbia to better his opportunities in hockey. He attended Vancouver Christian School while playing at the bantam level for the North Vancouver Winter Hawks.|$|E
5|$|Jaffe {{noted that}} the low-tech method of {{suspending}} actors by wires helped the final effect, because as photographed by John Fante, few wires {{had to be removed}} digitally in post-production; sets were constructed so that the harsh lighting obscured wires, and entire sets were constructed on their sides so that by pulling actors {{up and down on the}} rotated sets, the characters appeared to float sideways. These sets were on gimbals so that the movement of the actors and sets created a floating effect. The shot of two Klingons killed and thrown back down a corridor by phaser blasts was simulated by positioning the camera at the bottom of a corridor set. The set was placed on its end in the tallest soundstage at Paramount, so that the camera <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> towards the ceiling. In this position, the wires were hidden by the actors as they ascended the corridor.|$|E
5|$|Morales {{was first}} sent to Cámus's unit, the 3rd Regiment of the Line, {{which was at}} the front of Chile's campaigns during much of the war. Although she officially was not a soldier and was not {{supposed}} to participate in combat, this did not deter her from fighting alongside the men of her regiment. Indeed, she was noted for her great skill with a rifle. She fought at the amphibious landing and fierce ensuing assault on a Peruvian position of the Battle of Pisagua on 2 November 1879 and at the Battle of San Francisco on 19 November. She was <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to by the men of her unit for her selfless nursing of the wounded after battles. She also put herself at risk several times to save captured Peruvian soldiers from being abused by her compatriots.|$|E

5|$|Schneider {{was born}} to Susan and Richard Schneider in Marblehead, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. Schneider started {{training}} with his goalie coach, Brian Daccord, at age 15, who now owns Stop It Goaltending, a company of which currently Schneider owns a small percentage. He began playing hockey around the age of six, trying out for the same team as his older brother, Geoff. He did not become a regular goaltender {{until the age of}} 11, as the Marblehead Youth Hockey teams he played with at earlier ages rotated the position. Growing up, Schneider <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to Mike Richter of the New York Rangers for being a successful American goaltender. Paying homage to Richter, he chose to wear the jersey number 35.|$|E
5|$|Sensing that {{he would}} have limited {{opportunities}} at Barcelona, Fàbregas joined Premier League club Arsenal in their Academy, signing for the London club on 11 September 2003. Initially, he found life difficult in England's capital but soon struck a friendship with Spanish-speaking teammate Philippe Senderos, who helped him settle down. As a 16-year-old, Fàbregas did not contemplate breaking into the first team immediately but <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to senior players like Patrick Vieira and Gilberto Silva, while concentrating on training and learning the English language. He nevertheless made his debut for Arsenal not long after, on 28 October 2003, in a League Cup tie at home to Rotherham United. In doing so, he became Arsenal's youngest-ever first team player, aged 16 years and 177 days. He then became the youngest goalscorer in Arsenal's history in a later round of the League Cup, scoring in a 5–1 victory against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Although Arsenal {{went on to win the}} league unbeaten in the 2003–04 season, Fàbregas was not awarded a winner's medal because he did not play a single league game.|$|E
5|$|Stars such as James Cagney redefined their images.

Breen in essence neutered Groucho Marx, removing most of his jokes which directly referenced sex, although some sexual references slipped through unnoticed in the Marx Brothers post-Code pictures. In the political realm, films such Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939) in which James Stewart tries to change the American system from within while reaffirming its core values, stand {{in stark contrast to}} Gabriel Over the White House where a dictator is needed to cure America's woes.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} released for the Amiga and Atari ST in 1991, running at a display resolution of 320×200 pixels. These versions received less play-testing than other versions, making for a less-fluid game, but the Amiga's sound capabilities afford it a high sound quality compared to contemporary ports. The game released on the Atari ST is identical, {{but with a}} less refined sound, and its colors are less sharp than on Amiga. These versions had code wheel protection that {{made it difficult to}} use unauthorized copies, forcing the player to enter a code (series of figures) <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> from a code wheel that came with the game. The player had to turn the wheel according to the number that was requested in the screen whenever the game is loaded in order to reload the game. Another small change between the Amiga and ST versions and the others was that Lester would yell as he grabs the vine in the first area if he was not being chased by the beast in these versions; this feature was omitted from most other versions.|$|E
5|$|Celestine Babayaro, who {{had been}} {{struggling}} with an injury, played no further part in the final and was substituted before the second half commenced. Terry came on in his place to partner Desailly, which meant Gallas moved to left-back. Arsenal resumed play and a shot by Henry was kept out by Cudicini. The scare brought Chelsea to life and resulted in the team enjoying their best spell of the match. Guðjohnsen's effort in the 57th minute forced a save from Seaman, who tipped the ball over the bar. Jesper Grønkjær then roamed forward and played the ball to Le Saux, but the defender's shot went well over. Chelsea continued to pile pressure on Arsenal; Grønkjær's pass intended for Hasselbaink in the 61st minute was intercepted just in time by Adams and Melchiot's header unsettled Seaman in goal. Wiltord then collected the ball from midfield and played a one-two with Henry, but directed his shot wide from the left flank. Chelsea made their second change in the 67th minute, bringing on Zola for Hasselbaink. The substitution {{did not have the}} desired effect as Arsenal went a goal ahead. Adams cleared the Chelsea danger and Wiltord's reverse pass found Parlour with acres of space to manoeuvre. The midfielder advanced as the Chelsea defence backed off and <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> before curling the ball from 25 yards. His effort went over a diving Cudicini, into the top right-hand corner of the Chelsea goal.|$|E
5|$|During the {{beginning}} of World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had re-introduced the draft (conscription) in September 1940, and Koval registered for it on January 2, 1941. Raven Electric Company secured him a year's deferment from service until February 1942. According to historian Vladimir Lota, Koval's handlers wanted him to steal information about chemical weapons, and felt {{that he would not}} be able to do so while drafted. When the deferment expired, Koval was inducted into the United States Army. He received basic training at Fort Dix in New Jersey before being sent to the Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina. There, Koval served as a private in the 3410th Specialized Training and Reassignment Unit. On August 11, 1943, he was transferred to the Army Specialized Training Program, a unit established in December 1942 to provide talented enlistees with an education and technical training. Koval attended the City College of New York (CCNY) and studied electrical engineering. His CCNY classmates <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to the older Koval as a role model and father figure who never did homework and was a noted ladies' man, never knowing about his Soviet education and wife.
