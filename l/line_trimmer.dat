40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award {{of the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Three-dimensional appearance models represent an essential outcome of industrial design practice, facilitating the origination, evaluation and specification of exterior form. As manufacturers face increasing pressure to reduce time scales for new product development, the production of such models using conventional fabrication techniques must be appraised. As a means of economically translating digital geometry into one-off components, rapid prototyping has the potential to contribute towards a reduction in lead times for the production of appearance models. The objective of this research is to propose a methodological approach for the effective integration of rapid prototyping within industrial design practice. The field and practice of industrial design is defined, the technology of rapid prototyping discussed, and their integration proposed through a draft computer-aided industrial design/rapid prototyping (CAID/RP) methodological approach. This is exposed to practitioner feedback, modified, and employed as a revised CAID/RP methodological approach during the industrial design of a nylon <b>line</b> <b>trimmer.</b> The product outcome is used to compare and contrast the production of an appearance model via rapid prototyping, an appearance prototype via rapid prototyping, and an appearance model via conventional fabrication techniques. Two issues arise from the use of the revised CAID/RP methodological approach: the production of stl files and the lack of physical interaction with product form. In addition, the emergence of rapid prototype sketch modelling systems following the <b>line</b> <b>trimmer</b> case study provides an opportunity for further enhancement. A strategy for the resolution of these issues is proposed, and their effectiveness evaluated through additional case studies. The resulting CAID/RP methodological approach is subject to validation through practitioner interviews and a normalised rating/weighting method. The positive feedback acknowledges the significance of the CAID/RP methodological approach through a reduction in product development lead times and enhancement of professional practice. The project makes a contribution to new knowledge and understanding in the area of professional practice through the definition and validation of operational paradigmatic change...|$|E
30|$|ZR {{arrived in}} Italy in 1986, and {{has engaged in}} catering, bags, and other industries. He {{acquired}} basic Italian fluency when waiting tables. In subsequent years he brought his mother and siblings to Italy. In 1993, influenced by his brother-in-law, he came to Prato {{and went into the}} clothing business. “I had a state of mind of fear. I had never seen the clothes, and I could only constantly ask and constantly learn.” Fortunately many of ZR’s classmates and relatives were already in Prato. Coupled with ZR’s own efforts to learn, the garment factory achieved resounding success in one year. Recalling his original intention to go abroad, ZR stated, “My family had difficulties, then I wanted to go abroad to change the living conditions for my family. When I first came I was really frustrated, and felt like crying a lot. But no matter how hard it was I was very happy. … When I was in Prato, very few people understood the language. Sometimes my relatives and fellows got sick or needed to give birth; we went to the hospital and they did not understand anything. No matter how tired I was, I went to the hospital with them. The hospital staff all knew me.” A strong sense of responsibility and commitment to family became ZR’s motivation to continuously learn and constantly create value for twenty years. His reputation among his peers also helped ZR acquire critical information in many industries. ZR “started everything from a mere factory worker, learned to use the <b>line</b> <b>trimmer,</b> the double cylinder machine, thanks to his own efforts to learn.” With the dedication and talent, ZR soon learned clothing techniques and industry terminology and rapidly became able to work independently. “I love to learn more than others, always willing to learn. When I was working in Milan, I learned all the basic terminology from different restaurants; later when I opened up the garment factory I slowly learned the terminology in clothing also. If I want to settle down here, I at least need to speak some simple Italian. I used the restaurant experience to communicate with foreigners, and received a good client.” In addition, ZR also stated,” I hold the bar high for all employees; that’s why foreigners like to work with us. The company’s decoration is also completely different than others. Standardized decoration, good management practices—only by keeping up with these will foreigners trust us.” His advantage in language makes it easier for ZR to build trust with Italian customers. Continuous improvement of daily management helped his factory expand rapidly. ZR gained recognition outside of his network community due to continuous learning of existing industry knowledge; his strong sense of responsibility stems from strong ties outside of the network that promoted rapid trust building.|$|E

50|$|Let's {{begin by}} tracing the signal {{path from the}} {{splitter}} to the audience. The signal leaves the splitter, typically via an Audio multicore cable, and travels to the Front of House position. Here, the still-mic-level signal enters into a microphone preamplifier, which boosts the signal voltage to line level. For this example, the microphone preamplifier is built into a mixing board. It is typical for a mixing board to include a <b>line</b> <b>trim</b> after the preamplifier. This allows the amplitude of the now line-level signal to be adjusted. This may be done for artistic or technical reasons. A typical application for the <b>line</b> <b>trim</b> is attenuating signals that were intentionally amplified too much by the microphone preamplifier. Over amplifying the signal can cause the preamplifier to distort, which can under certain circumstances produce a desirable sound.|$|R
