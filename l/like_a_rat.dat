5|$|Rain World is a 2017 {{survival}} platformer {{video game}} in which the player controls a part-slug, part-cat creature searching a hostile, derelict world for its family. The Slugcat uses debris as weapons to escape randomized enemies, forage for food, and reach safe hibernation rooms before a deadly torrential rain arrives. The player is given little explicit guidance on how to survive, which was {{the intention of the}} developers, who wanted players to feel <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rat</b> living on subway tracks, in which they learn to survive in an environment without grasping its higher-level function. Rain World was developed by Videocult, a small indie team, over six years and published by Adult Swim Games for PlayStation 4 and Windows in March 2017. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its art design and fluid animations, but disliked its brutal difficulty and imprecise controls.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} not without its detractors. Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, [...] "It's {{a measure of how}} the film {{operates}} that not once do we feel particular sympathy for any of the shark's victims.... In the best films, characters are revealed in terms of the action. In movies like Jaws, characters are simply functions of the action... like stage hands who move props around and deliver information when it's necessary". He did, however, describe it as [...] "the sort of nonsense that can be a good deal of fun". Los Angeles Times critic Charles Champlin disagreed with the film's PG rating, saying that [...] "Jaws is too gruesome for children, and likely to turn the stomach of the impressionable at any age.... It is a coarse-grained and exploitative work which depends on excess for its impact. Ashore it is a bore, awkwardly staged and lumpily written." [...] Marcia Magill of Films in Review said that while Jaws [...] "is eminently worth seeing for its second half", she felt that before the protagonists' pursuit of the shark the film was [...] "often flawed by its busyness". William S. Pechter of Commentary described Jaws as [...] "a mind-numbing repast for sense-sated gluttons" [...] and [...] "filmmaking of this essentially manipulative sort"; Molly Haskell of The Village Voice similarly characterized it as a [...] "scare machine that works with computer-like precision.... You feel <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rat,</b> being given shock therapy". The most frequently criticized aspect of the film has been the artificiality of its mechanical antagonist: Magill declared that [...] "the programmed shark has one truly phony close-up", and in 2002, online reviewer James Berardinelli said that if not for Spielberg's deftly suspenseful direction, [...] "we would be doubled over with laughter at the cheesiness of the animatronic creature." [...] Halliwell's Film Guide stated that [...] "despite genuinely suspenseful and frightening sequences, it is a slackly narrated and sometimes flatly handled thriller with an over-abundance of dialogue and, when it finally appears, a pretty unconvincing monster." ...|$|E
500|$|An Albanian account {{describes}} the dispute as follows: [...] "By violating the formal Albanian-Soviet agreements signed in September 1957 an May 1959, the Soviet government did {{everything in its}} power to put under its control this Albanian base which {{at the same time}} served the defence of the socialist countries... On April 5, 1961, in a letter addressed to the governments of the Soviet Union and the East-European states it resolutely reaffirmed that it accepted only one solution of the problem: the base of Vlora belonged to Albania and all the naval means that were its property should be handed over to Albanian crew as soon as possible. Any other solution was an act which would lead to the unilateral violation {{on the part of the}} Soviet Union of the existing Albanian-Soviet agreements of the years 1957 and 1959." [...] In May 1961 the Soviets began dismantling the base and tried to seize the submarines, seizing some Albanian ships undergoing repairs at Sevastopol in the process. As the Albanian account describes it, [...] "The Soviet sailors and officers carried out numerous provocations, trying by all manner of means to create a pretext for the Soviet military intervention in Albania... On May 26, 1961 it seized in a demonstrative manner 8 submarines, the floating base 'Kotelnikov', as well as the Albanian warships that were laid for repair in the port of Sevastopol. On June 5, 1961 the personnel of Soviet advisers left the base at Vlora, too." [...] Hoxha's account is as follows: Admiral Vladimir Kasatonov of the Black Sea fleet [...] "came to Tirana with the mission of seizing not only the eight submarines... but even the submarines which we had taken over earlier. We told him bluntly: Either you hand the submarines over to us according to the agreement, or within a short time (we set the date) you must withdraw immediately from the bay... He did not hand over the submarines, but went to Vlora, boarded the command submarine and lined up the others in fighting formation. We gave orders to close the Sazan Narrows and to train the guns on the Soviet ships. Admiral Kasatonov, who had wanted to frighten us, was frightened himself. He was caught <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rat</b> in a trap and if he attempted to implement his plan he might find himself at the bottom of the sea. In these conditions the admiral was obliged to take only the submarines with Soviet crews, and he sailed out of the bay back home with his tail between his legs." ...|$|E

2500|$|Garcia's {{favorite}} target {{while with}} the 49ers was WR Terrell Owens. In 2003, Garcia and Owens's relationship turned sour upon Garcia taking issue with Owens's public {{praise for the}} play of backup quarterback Tim Rattay. Garcia responded with a cryptic [...] "we can not let the sickness spread" [...] remark, prompting Owens to wear a surgeon's mask at the following practice. Following Owens's trade to Philadelphia, Owens was asked in a Playboy interview if he thought Garcia was gay, to which he responded, [...] "If it looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rat</b> and smells <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rat,</b> by golly, it is a rat." [...] Garcia called Owens' insinuations [...] "ridiculous" [...] and [...] "untrue." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Now {{there is}} a mystery about the native country {{of the best known}} species of rat, the common brown rat. It is {{frequently}} called, in books and otherwise, the 'Norway rat', and it {{is said to have been}} imported into this country in a ship-load of timber from Norway. Against this hypothesis stands the fact that when the brown rat had become common in this country, it was unknown in Norway, although there was a small animal <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rat,</b> but really a lemming, which made its home there." ...|$|E
2500|$|The word [...] "opossum" [...] is {{borrowed}} from the Powhatan language and was first recorded between 1607 and 1611 by John Smith (as opassom) and William Strachey (as aposoum). Both men encountered the language at the British settlement of Jamestown, Virginia, which Smith helped to found and where Strachey later served as its first secretary. Strachey's notes describe the opossum as a [...] "beast in bigness of a pig and in taste alike," [...] while Smith recorded it [...] "hath an head like a swine ... tail <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rat</b> ... of the bigness of a cat." [...] The Powhatan word ultimately derives from a Proto-Algonquian word (*wa·p-aʔθemwa) meaning [...] "white dog or dog-like beast." ...|$|E

However he suffered a poor run of form. Turner decided to retire {{at the end of the}} summer, aged only 27. [...] "I was trying my guts out this season", he said at the time. [...] "I really was, but things just didn't go my way... I have not gained ground in any direction in the past 12 months. I have been static in my cricket.

50|$|Quite {{a number}} of names {{have been used to}} {{describe}} the noodle. The noodle is more commonly known as silver needle noodle in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and rat noodle in Malaysia and Singapore. It is known as locupan in Indonesia. The noodles are named as such because the shape of the noodles is long and tapered much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>rat's</b> tail, translucent white like needles, or from the way the noodles are made by pushing them through the holes of a sieve.|$|R
