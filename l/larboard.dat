5|$|A {{more recent}} {{critical}} review of contemporary sources doesn't require a supposed typo in 1771 {{to explain this}} shorter measurement for the mizzen whilst {{at the same time}} offers supporting evidence of its cap being at the taller supposed normal height. Sydney Parkinson's sketches and paintings of Cooks Bark Endeavour along with the 1771 Woolwich Yard Bark Endeavour spar measurements National Maritime Museum in Greenwich NMM ZAZ6594, and other contemporary sources suggest that the shorter mizzen mast was not stepped in the hold/keelson, but instead was stepped in the lower deck 10ft above this as was sometimes done. This would bring its standing height at the cap to within a supposed normal height of around 8– 9ft below the main mast cap and approx 5.5ft below the foremast cap when comparing the heights of the standing mast tops (excludes top and gallant masts) from the level of the water line. Whereas the shorter mizzen stepped in the hold on the keelson instead of the lower deck would make the standing mizzen cap 18ft below the main mast cap which is clearly not the case when critically examining Sydney Parkinson's drawings and the contemporary painting titled HMS Endeavour off the coast of New Holland, by Samuel Atkins c. 1794 {{at the top of this}} page. Zooming this painting also reveals that the position of the mizzen channel is forward to inline with the mast which it is when looking at the angle of the mizzen chainplates on the original as fitted draught NMM ZAZ7844. Using these mizzen chainplate angles from this as fitted draught it is possible to extrapolate where the top of the standing mast could be and combined with the similar shroud angles Sydney Parkinson drew in his sketch of the <b>larboard</b> quarter of Endeavour support this theory of the shorter standing mizzen stepped in the lower deck which would make its standing cap 10 foot higher than if stepped in the hold.|$|E
25|$|She {{joined the}} fleet in {{entering}} Vigo Bay on 28 July, {{and went into}} Ferrol on 2 August. Neptune sailed {{with the rest of}} the fleet on 9 August, and put into Cadiz on 20 August. After spending several months there, watched by the blockading British fleet under Nelson, Villeneuve decided to put to sea in mid-October. Maistral prepared Neptune for sea, and the fleet sailed from Cadiz on 19 October. While in Cadiz Villeneuve had described Neptune as being 'In every respect one of the finest and most seaworthy ships of the Fleet.' As the British approached on the morning of 21 October, Villeneuve formed the line of battle heading northwards, with Neptune the twelfth in the line from the lead ship of the van. She was ahead of the flagship, Bucentaure, on her <b>larboard</b> quarter, and astern on the <b>larboard</b> quarter was the 74-gun Redoutable.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton meticulously {{planned the}} capture. The {{boarding}} parties were clothed in dark only, {{with no sign}} of white or light colours. Each of the boats was placed in a formation of two divisions, and were towed in threes. One division would attack the starboard side while the other was to board the <b>larboard</b> side. Each boat was given as a specific task a part of the ship which they were responsible for securing.|$|E
25|$|Pytheas {{crossed the}} waters northward from Berrice, {{in the north}} of the British Isles, but whether to starboard, <b>larboard,</b> or {{straight}} ahead is not known. From the time of the Roman Empire all the possibilities were suggested repeatedly by each generation of writers: Iceland, Shetland, the Faroe Islands, Norway and later Greenland. A manuscript variant of a name in Pliny has abetted the Iceland theory: Nerigon instead of Berrice, which sounds like Norway. If one sails west from Norway one encounters Iceland. Burton himself espoused this theory.|$|E
25|$|On 7 May, {{while trying}} to lure the {{corvette}} towards Belle Île Vincejo drove a sloop ashore between Saint Gilda and Saint Jacques, Sarzou. In the morning of 8 May Vincejo found herself becalmed while the tide carried her towards the Teigneuse Rock. As Wright was attempting to warp her out to the channel, he observed that a flotilla of gunboats had come out from the Morbihan and was approaching Vincejo. The gunboats started firing {{as soon as they}} were in range and continued firing as they approached. Vincejo crew alternated between manning the <b>larboard</b> guns and the starboard sweeps, leaving them exhausted.|$|E
25|$|In the {{afternoon}} of 19 January, HMS Strombolo, a gunboat armed with one gun and {{under the command of}} Lieutenant William Davies, sailed to cover the departure of a convoy. She towed Transport 55 clear of the mole at Gibraltar and then returned to bring out another vessel. The activity drew the attention of the Spanish, who sent out a flotilla of gunboats and launches. Strombolo cast off her tow and moved to intercept the Spanish. Eight Spanish vessels surrounded her and in the exchange of fire, a Spanish cannonball holed Strombolo at the <b>larboard</b> bow. She rapidly filled with water so the crew abandoned her; the Spanish picked them up from the water.|$|E
25|$|The {{two ships}} {{exchanged}} broadsides {{for the next}} seven hours. Bonne Citoyenne was at a disadvantage early on. Not only was she much smaller, but three of her guns were quickly dismounted. She nevertheless fired 129 broadsides to the enemy's 70, with Mounsey alternating between the starboard and <b>larboard</b> sides as circumstances permitted. By the end of the battle Bonne Citoyenne had lost her top masts, her lower masts were badly damaged, and her rigging, sails and boats had been shot to pieces. Realizing that he was running out of powder, Mounsey decided to force the issue and prepared to board the French ship. Before he could do so, Furieuse surrendered and Mounsey took possession.|$|E
25|$|Reunion put to sea on 8 August in {{the company}} of HMS Isis, 50 guns, and Vestal, 28 guns, and on 12 August they were joined by another frigate, the 32-gun HMS Stag. On the 22nd, the squadron, under Almes orders, was {{cruising}} off the coast of Norway when at around 1300hrs, it spotted two ships and a cutter to windward and heading towards shore on a <b>larboard</b> tack. These ships proved to be the 36-gun frigates, Alliance and Argo, and the 16-gun cutter, Vlugheld. A favourable wind change allowed Stag to overhaul the rear most ship, Alliance, and bring her to action at about 1615hrs while the remaining British ships engaged in a running battle with Argo and Vlugheld. After an hour's fighting, Stag managed to force the surrender of her larger opponent but Argo, despite suffering much damage, and Vlugheld escaped into port at 1730hrs.|$|E
25|$|Admiral Byng had {{commanded}} the British fleet sent to relieve Menorca in 1756, {{but after a}} brief and indecisive engagement, he drew off and allowed the island to fall to the French. Incensed, the British public demanded an investigation. Byng was arrested, and tried by court martial for having breached the Articles of War. Though Byng was acquitted of cowardice or disaffection, he {{was found guilty of}} failing to do his utmost, which carried a mandatory death sentence. Byng was brought aboard Monarch, which by then was anchored at Portsmouth under Captain John Montagu. Montagu recorded in the ship's log for 14 March 1757: These 24 hours very squally, with showers of wind and rain; Admiral Byng's Co. as before; at 7 A.M. his Coffin came on board; at 10 A.M. all the Ships' Boats, manned and armed, came to attend his Execution; hard gales, lowered down the lower yards: at noon all hands were called up to attend his execution; he was shot on the <b>larboard</b> side of the Quarter Deck by six Marines, attended by Lieut. Clark, the Marshal, and Mr. Muckings; these gentlemen went ashore after the execution was over.|$|E
500|$|Fremantle then {{spotted the}} towering {{mass of the}} Spanish four-decker Santísima Trinidad sailing away from him, and steered towards her {{starboard}} quarter {{in the hope of}} raking her stern. Opening fire with his <b>larboard</b> battery, he positioned Neptune off the Spanish vessel's starboard beam and the two exchanged heavy fire for the next hour as more British ships poured through the gap astern of Neptune. Neptune took fire from other ships of the combined fleet as they sailed past. Santísima Trinidad, heavily battered by Neptunes guns, as well as those from the 74-gun ships [...] and , became completely dismasted and covered in debris. She fought on until 5.30 pm, when she struck her colours, having sustained casualties of 205 dead and 103 wounded. Neptune left the 98-gun [...] to take possession and headed north to cut off the remains of the enemy fleet, briefly becoming engaged with the French 74-gun Intrépide. During the battle Neptune suffered considerable damage to her masts, although they did not fall. Most of her rigging was cut to pieces and she sustained nine shot holes in her hull. She sustained casualties of ten killed and 34 wounded. A remarkably small proportion of her officers became casualties, with only the captain's clerk, Richard Hurrell, being wounded.|$|E
500|$|Neptune formed part of {{the weather}} column in the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October, and was the third ship from the lead, {{situated}} between her sister HMS Temeraire, and the 74-gun [...] Fremantle had been promised a position second to Nelson aboard , and by 10 o'clock was sailing fast enough to threaten to overtake her. Fremantle hoped to pass her, and lead the line into battle, but Nelson ordered Neptune, take in your studding-sails and drop astern. I shall break the line myself.' Neptune went into action with her band playing, and everyone except the officers and the band lying down on the deck {{to protect them from}} enemy fire. Ahead of her Fremantle saw Eliab Harvey's Temeraire turn to pass astern of the French Redoutable, but resolved to follow Nelson and HMS Victory to pass astern of the French flagship Bucentaure. As she passed under Bucentaures stern, Neptune discharged a double-shotted broadside from her <b>larboard</b> (port) guns, with devastating consequences on Villeneuve's already disabled flagship. Fremantle then had the helm swung hard to starboard, bringing his ship abeam of the Bucentaure. He fired two more triple-shotted broadsides from nearly 50 guns at a range of less than 100 yards into the beleaguered French ship.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 May Espoir {{arrived at}} Palermo bearing {{the news that}} the French fleet had been sighted off Oporto and was {{believed}} to be sailing to the Mediterranean. In June Espoir was off Cape delle Melle with Lord Keith's fleet. Although the frigate [...] had run into Espoir during the night, stoving in her <b>larboard</b> side, Espoir still took part in Keith's squadron's pursuit of a French squadron in the Action of 18 June 1799. Espoir later shared in the prize money for the capture of the three frigates , Alceste, and Junon, and the two French brigs Alerte and Salamine.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the battle}} started Nelson's flagship, [...] broke the line ahead of Neptune, passing by and raking Bucentaure. As Victory passed by Neptune fired into {{her with a}} {{broadside}} from her <b>larboard</b> battery, damaging Victorys foremast, bowsprit, spritsail yards, her forward hull and her anchors. [...] Maistral then ordered Neptunes jib run up, to move her out of Victorys range. She briefly engaged [...] at long range, and then wore back to support Villeneuve. Standing someway off to leeward Neptunes gunners reloaded, and then opened fire with a broadside into [...] as the British ship came up through the gap created by Victorys passage. The broadsides cut Temeraires rigging, brought down her foreyard and main topmast, and damaged her fore mast and bowsprit. By now unmanageable, Temeraire came under fire from the San Justo, lying just astern of Neptune.|$|E
2500|$|Dundas was {{eventually}} forced to haul {{away from the}} Belleisle as night fell, and try to save his own ship. During the night the Naiads <b>larboard</b> topsail sheet blew away, and the reefed topsail sheet was split. The crew were forced to cut away the other sheet to save the yard, but the sheet blew away in the gale. Shortly afterwards the fore topmast staysail was blown to bits. Belleisle was also in a desperate situation, blown almost onto the breakers of the Spanish coast before her crew managed to wear her around. With difficulty she survived the night, and was found when the light came the next morning by Dundas, who had a line reattached. [...] He steered straight for Gibraltar, and came {{within sight of the}} rock by midday, despite having been fired on by the Spanish battery at Tarifa. Dundas took Naiad in and anchored at 1330 that afternoon, while the Belleisle was warped into the mole. Dundas subsequently was awarded a sword from the Lloyd's Patriotic Fund for his services at Trafalgar.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1813, Colibri and [...] were blockading the U.S. coast between Charleston and Georgetown. There {{was little}} {{shipping}} so the pair conducted {{a number of}} boat raids along the coast. They then decided to sail south of Charleston and on August they entered Port Royal Sound, South Carolina (not Port Royal, Jamaica as stated in some sources),. They anchored, but resistance by the local militia, which had erected shore batteries, forestalled any raids. Colibri and Moselle then {{decided to return to}} sea on August 23. However, the weather was poor and Colibri grounded on a sandbar as she led Moselle out. Attempts to lighten her and get her off were unsuccessful and as the tide went out she fell over to <b>larboard.</b> Her crew cut away her masts, but she was stuck fast. Moselle then rescued Colibris crew, who abandoned the wreck. [...] A hurricane on 27 August 1813 destroyed Colibri and her boats. Moselle was able to find a passage and navigate across the bar to the open sea on 29 August. Thomson and his officers and crew were subsequently acquitted of any wrongdoing at the court martial into the loss of Colibri.|$|E
2500|$|This was {{to lead to}} {{a celebrated}} {{exchange}} of letters between Phillimore and the Navy Board on the subject of paint. With the Diadem now only mounting 32 guns, the Board directed that she should receive stores equivalent to a ship of this rating, despite her much larger size and complement, and despite Phillimore's protests. Consequently, he only received money for enough paint to paint half his ship. Phillimore sent a pointed letter to the Board enquiring which half they wished him to paint, the starboard side or the <b>larboard</b> side. He then signed the letter [...] "your affectionate friend". The Board admonished him for this, pointing out that the custom of signing [...] "your affectionate friend" [...] was one practised by its own members and was the address used from a superior officer to an inferior one. Phillimore acknowledged his mistake, signing himself [...] "no longer your affectionate friend". The correspondence appears to have had its effect; the allowance was duly doubled. Phillimore spent his time in command of the Diadem carrying troops to and from the Iberian peninsula, supporting Arthur Wellesley's operations there.|$|E
6000|$|Though Dana sailed from Boston only {{three-quarters of}} a century ago, much that is at present {{obsolete}} was then in full sway. For instance, the old word <b>larboard</b> was still in use. He {{was a member of}} the <b>larboard</b> watch. The vessel was on the <b>larboard</b> tack. It was only the other day, because of its similarity in sound to starboard, that <b>larboard</b> was changed to port. Try to imagine [...] "All <b>larboard</b> bowlines on deck!" [...] being shouted down into the forecastle of a present day ship. Yet that was the call used on the Pilgrim to fetch Dana and the rest of his watch on deck.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, sir--very well--haul {{up on the}} <b>larboard</b> tack, as soon as possible, and get the <b>larboard</b> {{batteries}} clear. We {{may have}} to cripple the chap {{in order to get}} hold of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Pull <b>larboard</b> oar, will ye, Master Kirby?” {{cried the}} old seaman; “pull <b>larboard</b> best. It would puzzle the oldest admiral in their British fleet to cast this here net fair, with a wake like a corkscrew. Full {{starboard}}, boy, pull starboard oar, with a will.” ...|$|E
60|$|Next {{instant he}} sprang to the falls of the <b>larboard</b> quarterboat.|$|E
60|$|The Swallow {{staggered}} {{under the}} blow, recovered an instant, then listed ominously to <b>larboard.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{boats were}} here hailed, to tow the whale on the <b>larboard</b> side, where fluke chains and other {{necessaries}} were already prepared for securing him.|$|E
6000|$|... "He does, and is--he is standing, at this moment, on the <b>larboard</b> {{side of the}} companion-way, {{kneeling}} one knee, on {{the forward}} end of the hen-coop." ...|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile it had fared {{even worse}} with the frailer Infanta. Although hit by one shot only, this had crushed her <b>larboard</b> timbers on the waterline, {{starting}} a leak that must presently have filled her, {{but for the}} prompt action of the experienced Yberville in ordering her <b>larboard</b> guns to be flung overboard. Thus lightened, and listing now to starboard, he fetched her about, and went staggering after the retreating Arabella, followed by the fire of the fort, which did them, however, little further damage.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go on deck, my lord, {{and see if}} the Dover has hove in any {{upon her}} <b>larboard</b> bower, so as to bring her more on our quarter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No fear of that, lad," [...] said Buzzby, {{who stood}} near the <b>larboard</b> gangway and had overheard the remark. [...] "I'd know your father's brig among a thousand--" ...|$|E
60|$|They {{were within}} forty yards--another minute, and the shock would come. The Englishman's helm went up, his yards creaked round, and {{gathering}} way, he plunged upon the <b>larboard</b> galley.|$|E
6000|$|... "The <b>larboard</b> bower is gone, sir, and {{the blows}} you now hear {{are on the}} starboard, which is already half in two--that {{finishes}} it; the ship now hangs only by the warp." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not much fear of that, Moses--my {{great concern}} is that {{starboard}} bower-cable; it has {{a good deal more}} strain on it than the <b>larboard,</b> and you can see how the strands are stretched." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rouse away, my man, {{and light}} up! the ship has caught the breeze on her <b>larboard</b> bow, {{and begins to}} take the chain more freely. Remember that {{precious}} beings depend on us for safety!" ...|$|E
60|$|Down {{went the}} starboard, <b>larboard,</b> and waist-boats {{as if the}} falls had been cut, and almost before you could wink the men {{literally}} tumbled over the side into them, took their places, and seized their oars.|$|E
60|$|The Majestic {{was one of}} {{the four}} ships which sailed into action {{in the wake of the}} Admiral. Our hero, Bill Bowls, and his friend Ben Bolter, were {{stationed}} at one of the guns on the <b>larboard</b> side of the main deck. Flinders stood near them. Everything was prepared for action. The guns were loaded, the men, stripped to the waist, stood ready, and the matches were lighted, but as yet no order had been given to fire. The men on the <b>larboard</b> side of the ship stood gazing anxiously through the portholes at the furious strife in which they were about to engage.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I thank you," [...] {{said the}} second mate again. [...] "Take him yourself--he's yours by good rights--I don't want him." [...] And so {{they put me}} in the chief mate's division, that is the <b>larboard</b> watch.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ahoy! Peterson, Armitage, Wilson!" [...] he screamed. [...] "Cutlasses and pistols! Clear {{away the}} long-boat! Clear away the gig! Sharkey, the pirate, is in yonder dinghy. Whistle up the <b>larboard</b> watch, bo'sun, and tumble into the boats all hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If he {{has tried}} to lay-to, he will not have a sail left in the bolt-ropes, or perhaps a mast on deck. I know the stiff-neckedness of those Spanish tubs. Hurrah! there he is, right on our <b>larboard</b> bow!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Spare the slaves! Fire at the soldiers!" [...] cried Amyas; but {{the work}} was too hot for much discrimination; for the <b>larboard</b> galley, {{crippled}} but not undaunted, swung round across his stern, and hooked herself venomously on to him.|$|E
