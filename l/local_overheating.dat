40|$|Large {{quantity}} of asynchronous motors work in heavily dusted environments. On the end-winding insulation of the motors to 55 kW {{operating in the}} mining and smelting enterprise there is a 3 cm dust layer, which {{may lead to the}} asynchronous motor end-winding <b>local</b> <b>overheat</b> and consequent early breakdown. Contemporary literature allocates insufficient consideration to the issue of studying the impact the winding dust pollution has on the motor lifespan; {{for the most part they}} are experimental researches. The article investigates and establishes correlation relationship between the additional winding heating and the end-winding dust layer thickness. The investigation considers the induction motor winding to be a homogeneous solid and assumes the motor thermal conditions steady inasmuch as the winding insulation dust-cover forming time is much greater than the motor-heating time constant. The obtained expression permits determining the winding dust level by temperature variations; the dependence has linear character. Neither the motor type, size, nor the capacity do affect the <b>local</b> insulation <b>overheating</b> since the temperature difference between the windings being dust laden does not exceed 10 % for asynchronous motors of various capacity. The authors develop an appliance that enables the winding dustiness level monitoring and signals of necessity for the preventive cleaning measures implementation. The appliance operation principle is based on measuring results comparison of the two temperature-sensing devices mounted on the end-winding: one – in the upper part, and the other – in the bottom. The differential in the sensors reading-out allows estimating the dust layer sedimentation on the end-winding. A patent of invention has been issued on the investigation results.  </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} low {{relative}} humidity (RH) cycling (RHC 62 %/ 0 %) on the degradation mechanisms of a single proton exchange membrane fuel cell (5 x 5 ?cm 2) was investigated and compared to a cell operated at constant humidification (RHC?=? 62 %). The overall cell performance loss was near 33 mu V?h 1, which {{is greater than the}} voltage decay under constant RH condition near 3 ?mu V?h 1. The electroactive surface was reduced but to an acceptable level.

40|$|Efficient {{electroluminescence}} {{of silicon}} light emitting p-n diodes with different {{sizes and shapes}} is investigated at room temperature. High quantum efficiency of the diodes, a long linear dependence of the electroluminescence intensity on the diode current and a low energy shift of the emission line in electroluminescence spectra with increasing diode current are explained by the self-compression of injected electron-hole plasma into dense electron-hole plasma drops. Experiments on space scanning of the electroluminescence intensity of the diodes support this conclusion. The plasma self-compression is explained by existence of an attraction in electron-hole plasma, compensating the plasma pressure.

40|$|Ultrasonic {{hyperthermia}} and thermo-ablation are two promising {{alternatives for}} <b>local</b> tissue <b>overheating</b> of deep seated human tumours. After a short characterisation {{of the two}} techniques and {{the identification of the}} main parameters, results of an analytical theory of local heat up, cooling, and heat expansion are presented. The theory is based on a spherical model for hyper-thermia with a critical thermal dose and on a cylinder-symmetrical model for thermo-ablation with a critical temperature limit for thermal tissue coagulation. Two representative hard ware concepts are discussed. The hyperthermia applicator consists of a MHz transducer, which ro-tates concentrically in a water filled capsule with acoustically transparent window, and radiates collimated ultrasound under 45 ° into a concentric target area of nearly spherical symmetry. The applicator for thermo-ablation is a MHz transducer which radiates high intensity focussed ultra-sound (HIFU) into a “cigar shaped ” target area at the focal zone. Typical therapy diagrams for both techniques are presented. They show therapeutic target volumes as functions of the ther-apy time with the peak temperature or the radiated acoustic power as parameters. These dia-grams are discussed under consideration of power requirement, maximal sound intensity, and power efficiency at optimized frequency conditions. 1...|$|R

40|$|Friction Stir Welding {{has seen}} a fast uptake in many {{industry}} segments. Mechanical properties superior to fusion welding, the ability to weld "unweldable" aluminium alloys and low distortion are often described as {{the main reasons for}} the fast industrial implementation of FSW. Most existing applications consist of long straight welding joints. Applications with complex weld geometries, however, are rarely produced by FSW. These geometries can induce thermal variations during the welding process, thus making it challenging to maintain a consistent weld quality. In-process adaptation of weld parameters to respond to geometrical variations and other environmental variants allow new design opportunities for FSW. Weld quality {{has been shown to be}} reliant on the welding temperature. However, the optimal methodology to control the temperature is still under development. The research work presented in this thesis focuses on some steps to take in order to reach the improvement of the FSW temperature controller, thus reach a better and consistent weld quality. In the present work different temperature methods were evaluated. Temperature measurements acquired by the tool-workpiece thermocouple (TWT) method were accurate and fast, and thereby enhanced suitable for the controller. Different environmental conditions influencing the material heat dissipation were imposed in order to verify the controller effect on the joint quality. In comparison with no controlled weld, the use of the controller enabled a fast optimization of welding parameters for the different conditions, leading to an improvement of the mechanical properties of the joint. For short weld lengths, such as stitch welds, the initial plunge and dwell stages occupy a large part of the total process time. In this work temperature control was applied during these stages. This approach makes the plunge and dwell stages more robust by preventing <b>local</b> material <b>overheating,</b> which could lead to a tool meltdown. The TWT method was demonstrated to allow a good process control during plunging and continuous welding. The approach proposed for control offers weld quality consistency and improvement. Also, it allows a reduction of the time required for the development of optimal parameters, providing a fast adaptation to disturbances during welding and, by decreasing the plunge time, provides a significant decrease on the process time for short welds...|$|R
40|$|Protection {{of large}} high-field, high-energy {{accelerator}} magnets is very challenging with current technology. To avoid {{damage to the}} magnet coil by <b>local</b> or global <b>overheating,</b> the maximum temperature in the hot-spot of the magnet coil must be kept under certain levels depending on the materials used in the coil construction. The {{current state of the}} art technology seems unable to do so. A novel protection system for large superconducting magnets based on generating Inter Filament Coupling Loss through current oscillations in the magnet circuit is applied and simulated successfully for the Nb 3 Sn block-coil dipole magnet intended for use in a 100 [TeV] Future Circular Collider. The proposed protection system is able to keep the maximum temperature of the magnet coil during a quench below 350 [K] at nominal operating conditions, system parameters and geometry, and is shown to achieve a maximum temperature in the coil hot-spot as low as 260 [K] for the optimal protection system configuration. Several variations on the nominal coil geometry have been investigated, showing that an increase in inductance is detrimental while a reduction is beneficial {{from the point of view}} of the new protection system. Among the variations investigated are a graded coil and a coil with a larger aperture than the nominal geometry. The graded coil is found the most difficult to protect, while the larger aperture coil variant is the easiest to protect, with regards to the hot-spot temperature. A large parameter space has been investigated, and the most influential parameters are found to alter the hot-spot temperature by 50 [K], while the least influential by 10 [K] when moving away from their respective nominal values. Most influential are the electrical configuration of the protection system, the non-Copper content of the superconducting strands and the coil geometry. Least influential are the residual resistivity ratio and filament twist pitch. Taking the internal voltages to ground in the coil during application of the new protection system into account, the graded coil must be discarded completely, as turn-to-turn voltages can reach several hundred volt. The reduced inductance variants, therein the larger aperture one, proves the optimal also with respect to voltage: the turn-to-turn voltages are kept well below 100 [V], while the inter-layer voltage, critical for the application of the new protection system, only barely exceeds 1 [kV]...|$|R

Wagon or haystack boilers were heated from beneath and any scale or impurities that formed a sediment settled upon this plate, insulating it from the water.

However, the synthesis is complicated due to several problems. The exothermic reactions are often explosive due to <b>local</b> <b>overheating.</b> Oxidized metals, or even just an oxidized layer on the exterior of the metal, causes extreme and unacceptably high temperatures for beginning phosphorination. Hydrothermal reactions to generate nickel phosphides have produced pure and well crystallized nickel phosphide compounds, Ni2P and Ni12P5.
