40|$|Background An {{increasing}} number of patients are treated with direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), but the optimal way to reverse the anticoagulant effect is not known. Specific antidotes are not available and prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), activated PCC (aPCC) and recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) are variously used as reversal agents {{in case of a}} major bleeding. We aimed to determine the most effective haemostatic agent and dose to reverse the effect of rivaroxaban in blood samples from patients taking rivaroxaban for therapeutic reasons. Methods Blood samples from rivaroxaban-treated patients (n[*]=[*] 50) were spiked with PCC, aPCC and rFVIIa at concentrations imitating 80 %, 100 % and 125 % of suggested therapeutic doses. The reversal effect was assessed by thromboelastometry in whole blood and a thrombin generation assay (TGA) in platelet-poor plasma. Samples from healthy subjects (n[*]=[*] 40) were included as controls. Results In thromboelastometry measurements, aPCC and rFVIIa had a superior effect to PCC in reversing the rivaroxaban-induced <b>lenghtening</b> of clotting time (CT). aPCC was the only haemostatic agent that shortened the CT down to below the control level. Compared to healthy controls, patients on rivaroxaban also had a prolonged lag time and decreased peak concentration, velocity index and endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) in platelet-poor plasma. aPCC reversed these parameters more effectively than rFVIIa and PCC.

Our work wants to examine this topic, and will try to understand how healty volunteers respond to a noxious stimulus after exercise and after recovery from exercise of various intensity and duration. We evaluated the responses to two types of exercise: a) strong and short exercise, and b) medium and very long exercise.

40|$|International audienceAmong {{the large}} variety of {{experimental}} techniques amenable to probe disulfide radical anions, {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} (EPR) spectroscopy provides the most definitive assignment of these versatile transient intermediates in biochemistry [Stubbe et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999, 96, 8979 – 84; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009, 131, 200 – 211]. EPR parameters along both a series of 12 aliphatic 1, 2 -dithia-cycloalkane radical anions and a representative set of 18 short-loop peptides are investigated by means of density functional theory. While the g-tensor remains quasi-isotropic (with diagonal terms very close to 2. 0, as expected for a σ* singly occupied orbital), we evidence a dramatic conformational dependence of isotropic sulfur hyperfine coupling constants (hcc). Potential energy surface exploration of the prototypical dimethyldisulfide rationalizes their 3 – 4 -fold amplitude, with values ranging between 10 and 29 G for aliphatic moieties. Sulfur hcc’s are readily decomposed into three geometrical components: intersulfur distance, dihedral, and valence angles, with the latter being predominant. Increasing (respectively decreasing) contribution of sulfur atomic s orbital to the σ* molecular orbital, with a concomitant higher (respectively weaker) density around the sulfur nuclei, can be monitored on Walsh diagrams along each degree of motion. In peptidic disulfide radical anionic systems, sulfur hcc’s are dissymmetrized and span an even larger range of values, from 14 to 40 G. Again, dependence is governed by the mechanical embedding of the −CH 2 –S∴S–CH 2 – motif, {{this time with a}} noticeable contribution from the hemibond <b>lenghtening</b> and some punctual short-range additive electrostatic contributions.

A myorelaxograph (Datex NMT 100) measuring {{the responses of the}} adductor pollicis to Train of Four (TOF) stimulations of the ulnar nerve was installed after induction. Three bolus dosages of mivacurium were administered just after induction: 0. 15 mg/kg (group A), 0. 17 mg/kg (group B) and 0. 19 mg/kg (group C). Intubation was attempted at 75 % TI-suppression. The conditions of intubation were good to excellent in the three groups except for one patient in group A (0. 15 mg/kg). Successful intubation was performed faster in group C(p = 0. 017). The curarization time was significantly longer in group C(0. 19 mg/kg) vs the other groups (p = 0. 002). As soon as the first signs of recovery (TI increment) appeared, a continuous infusion of mivacurium (10 micrograms/kg/min) was started to maintain a complete neuromuscular block. After stopping the continuous infusion, there were no differences in spontaneous recovery between groups A and B but patients from group C showed a <b>lenghtening</b> of the recovery time.

40|$|Background. Renal {{function}} {{is a strong}} predictor of cardiovascular prognosis and cardiorenal disease is increasingly investigated. Cardiorenal Scintigraphy with the perfusion tracer 99 mTc-Tetrofosmin was proposed as a single combined examination allowing the simultaneous investigation of heart and kidney in cardiovascular patients, including hypertensives at risk of both cardiac and renal disease (Fommei, 2009). The renal uptake index (UI) of Tetrofosmin {{as a percent of}} the injected dose was used as a renal diagnostic parameter and found to be related to clinical and scintigraphic (99 mTc-DTPA) indexes of cardiorenal severity. Aim of the study. Here we tested 99 mTc-Tetrofosmin renal diagnostic validity in hypertensive patients in a comparison with 123 I-Hippuran scintigraphy as a gold standard for renal function. Patients and Methods. 22 hypertensive patients (5 F, 17 M, age range 46 - 79 yrs) were scheduled for both 99 mTc-Tetrofosmin cardiac G-SPECT and 123 -I Hippuran scintigraphy in their diagnostic workup. As previously described, cardiorenal scintigraphy consisted in a dynamic renal acquisition after Tetrofosmin bolus injection, followed by standard cardiac G-SPECT. Hippuran scintigraphy was performed in a separate day following standard procedures. Renal images and renograms were obtained and renal uptake was calculated for each kidney both in Tetrofosmin and Hippuran scintigraphies. Results. Tetrofosmin UI (mean 13. 13 ± 6. 9 SD%) resulted lower than Hippuran UI (23. 24 ± 12. 80 % (p< 0. 001) reflecting different intrarenal kinetics. Positive correlations were observed between the two tracers clearances and UI (either as total or separate kidney uptake) (p<. 01) and between Tetrofosmin UI and age, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance and the Doppler-renal resistive index (p<. 01). Five patients with angiographically confirmed renal artery stenosis showed corresponding renographic and scintigraphic abnormalities with both tracers. Conclusions. 99 mTc-Tetrofosmin cardiorenal scintigraphy may be used to obtain simultaneous renal and cardiac functional information which may be relevant for diagnosis and prognosis in states of cardiorenal diseases, with no study <b>lenghtening</b> nor an increase in the radiation burden to the patient compared to a standard cardiac study...|$|E

Cultured apices forming floral organs in non-inductive conditions were determined. The determination time for the sepal, petal and stamen whorls was 1 day whereas it was 5 days for the carpel whorl on medium supplemented with sucrose (2 %), on 4 - 7 % (w/v) (- 0. 29 to 0. 51 MPa) it was 3 days but partial replacement of sucrose with mannitol (- 0. 29 to 0. 51 MPa) <b>lenghtened</b> it to 5 - 6 days; thus, the effect was not caused by the osmotic potential per se. A similar reduction in carpel whorl determination time occurred on 1 : 1 glucose:fructose and fructose. Again, none of these changes occurred in mannitol treatments. Remarkably, glucose treatment (2, 3 or 6 %), resulted in a carpel determination time of one day demonstrating that glucose specified carpels alongside other whorls. DNA replication was measured in the shoot meristems of Silene coeli-rosa (long day (LD) plant) and P. nil during floral determination. The plants were subjected to florally inductive or non-inductive treatments, exposed to tritiated thymidine and apical domes were prepared as fibre autoradiographs. In S. coeli-rosa, replicon size was 10 - 15 um in SD (non-inductive) and 0 - 5 um in LD (inductive) while in P. nil it was 10 - 15 um in the 48 h dark interrupted by red light, 5 - 10 um in continuous light (both non-inductive) but was reduced to 0 - 5 um in the 48 h dark treatment (inductive).

40|$|Many {{experts believe}} that the {{uninterrupted}} lengthening of trip distances, and especially trip-to-work distances, is carried mostly by urban sprawl combined to growing functional (economic functions/residential functions) and social (high-class residential areas/low-class residential areas) specialization of urban space. According to them, these three dynamics (urban sprawl - functional specialization - social specialization) drag along quantitative and qualitative spatial imbalances between economic and residential functions and these spatial imbalances contribute to widen the distance separating workers' homes and job places, and hence, to <b>lenghten</b> the trips-to-work. On {{the basis of this}} diagnosis, the re-establishement of a greater balance, on both quantitative and qualitative grounds, between jobs and housing in different areas of the city is currently emerging as a major issue regarding the car-traffic reducing goal. Making the assumption that the multiplication of long-distance trips occurs as a consequence of greater difficulties encountered by households searching decent housing nearby workplaces, many experts argue that efficient urban policies promoting a diversified housing supply nearby job centres would allow more reasonable commuting distances and that such a return should go forth with a reduction in car traffic. In this paper, through a simulation model based on re-assignment of households closer to their workplaces, we examine the potential of car traffic reduction {{in the case of the}} Paris region. More precisely the impact of jobs-housing balance policy is based on a simulation model which states assignment of households located far from their work place within zones located nearer to the work place. The households that are reassigned are those where all workers travel more than a given time-threshold to reach their work place. These households are relocated within a perimeter around either the work place of the head of the household if it is a one worker household or the work place of the female worker if it is a two worker household - this perimeter is defined with reference to a time-threshold (set to 20, 30 or 45 minutes by private car or by public transport). For each type of household (defined according to social status, number of workers and family profile), the type of housing demanded by reassigned households is derived from the structure of housing detained by households that are already located within the perimeter of re-assignment. Three analyses are conducted on the basis of this simulation. According to the different time-thresholds : first, we estimate the total distances saved on home-work trips by private car when households are reassigned. Second, we identify the characteristics of reassigned households (especially social status, number of workers, family profile, residential location, job location, etc.). Third, we estimate the housing offer/demand imbalance after re-assignment (with specific interest for the case of housing for low-income groups) ...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2013 Her bireyin bir kimliği olduğu gibi, bireylerin oluşturduğu kentlerin de birer kimlikleri vardır. Kimlik kavramı canlı olan her organizmanın sahip olduğu, benzerliklerin ve farklılıkların ortaya çıkmasını sağlayan bir kavramdır. Dönüşüm uygulanan alanlarda yaşayan bireylerin kimlikleri olduğu gibi, içerisinde yaşadıkları kentin, bölgenin hatta mekanların da kimlikleri vardır. Dolayısıyla, kent içerisinde uzun yıllardan beri yer kaplayan yapıları yıkıp yeniden yapma eylemi, ilk olarak bireyleri, sonra bireylerin içerisinde yaşadıkları kenti etkilemektedir. Bursa kent merkezinde var olan Doğanbey, Tayakadın, Kiremitçi ve Kırcaali mahallelerinin, içerisinde bulunduğu fiziksel köhneme süreci göz önünde bulundurularak, yerel yönetimler tarafından verilen kararlar dahilinde dönüştürülmesini konu alan tez çalışması, uygulanan projenin, tamamlanmadan önce ve tamamlandıktan sonra bölgede ikamet eden bireyler ve kentin kimliği üzerindeki etkilerini açıklamakta, dönüşüm uygulamalarının uygulandıkları kentler üzerinde yarattıkları etkiyi ortaya çıkartmaya çalışmaktaıdr. Dönüşüm uygulanan dört mahalle, sosyal, fiziksel, ekonomik ve kültürel anlamda, belirli sınırlara sahiptir. Bu sınırlar içerisinde, iletişim en üst seviyede yaşanmakta ve Türk kültürünün en önemli faktörlerinden olan komşuluk kavramı daha da anlam kazanmaktadır. Bölge, fiziksel konum itibari ile ise, Bursa tarihi kent merkezine cephe olan, doku olarak, örüntü şeklinde gelişen yapıların oluşturduğu bir bölge olma özelliği taşımaktadır. Ayrıca bölge, fiziksel köhneleşme süreci içerisine girmiş fakat, alçak katlı yapılaşma sebebiyle Bursa silüeti üzerinde olumsuz etkisi olmayan bir bölgedir. Dönüşüm uygulamalarının en önemli kriterleri arasında olan, projelerin uygulandıkları bölgeye göre planlamaya sahip olmaları ve uygulandıkları bölgedeki kullanıcıların da sürece dahil olması bu proje açısından irdelenmiş ve projenin başarı oranı ortaya çıkartılmaya çalışılmıştır. Dönüşüm uygulanan dört mahallede yaşayan bireylerin, dönüşümden sonra hala bölgede yaşamaya devam edip etmedikleri, dönüşümden önceki yaşam tarzlarını sürdürüp sürdürmedikleri, projenin mevcutta yaşayan bireylere uygun planlanıp planlanmadığı ya da, projeye mevcutta yaşayanların sosyal zorluklar çekmemesi ve sosyal strese maruz kalmamaları için ne gibi eklentiler yapıldığı tez çalışmasının odak noktasını oluşturmaktadır. Ayrıca, dönüşümden sonra ortaya çıkabilecek sosyal sorunlar ve tarihi kent kimliğine sahip olan Bursa kentinin dokusunda, silüetinde ortaya çıkacak olan sorunlar tartışılmıştır. Pilot çalışmalar dahilinde oluşturulan anket soruları ile, bölgede dönüşümden önce yaşamış ve sonra yaşamaya devam eden bireyler ile anketler ve görüşmeler yapılmış ve proje konusundaki memnuniyet durumları ortaya çıkartılmıştır. The {{residential}} {{stock has}} begun to insufficient as labor class moved to cities with the industry revolution. Urban regeneration projects emerged {{in order to prevent}} unhealtful built environment. It is aimed to present more liveable environment to cities and people as well as finding solutions to current problems with the these projects. As all individual has an identity, cities that are constituted by individuals have it too. As a term,identity that all organism have it and reveals similiarities and differences between. Cities, districts and even spaces have an identity as well as individuals who lives at urban regeneration project areas. Thus, reconstruction of buildings which placed in a city for many years affects individuals primaryly then the city where people live in. This thesis aims to research the effects of the urban regeneration project (that is decided by local government with considering the physical corruption of the areas) on the dwellers who live before and after the project applied at the central districts of Bursa as Doganbey,Kiremitci and Kircaali and the effects on the identity of the city. These four districts have boundries in terms of social, physical, economical and cultural life. In this boundry, relations are being lived at the highest level and neighbourhood {{which is one of the}} most significant facts in Turkish culture has becoming more meaningful. More over, the mentioned districts located nearby the historical city center of Bursa and has a random pattern that buildings added in time. They are in a physical corruption process but they do not have an negative affect on the silhouette of Bursa because of its low-rise costruction. Bursa Doganbey urban regeneration project has placed nearby the historical caravanserai area. Therefore it should have more specific design criterias than a standart regeneration project. The history of the city center goes to establish of the Ottoman Empire. This shows, experiences of a city deepen as the history of the city goes back further. As the spent time in a city <b>lenghten</b> traces of citizens deepen too. Hence cities gain their identity by people, time and changing terms. The most significant criteria at regeneration projects is suitability of the concept to the users of the area. Because from the first appear of the notion, user satisfaction has became the most important fact for the success of projects. The sustainability of the dwellers who lives before the project and their happiness after the project applied are the crucial point for the achivement of projects. The happiness of citizens is essential for the peace of a city. When individuals become happy where they live in, they feel more belong to and reflect to places and spaces. After years where urban regeneration areas realized places has became desolate and lack of identity. İt should not be ignored that the reason for this is planning unsuited and irrelevant projects for users of areas. In the light of all these informations the Bursa Doğanbey urban regeneration project is researched and via the surveys and interviews with the initial and recent dwellers, the success rate of the project is tried to be examined. Bursa Doganbey regeneration project has changed the corrupted and 2 - 3 floored private masonry housed area to 22 - 23 floored apartmants area. This situation {{has begun to}} cause social stress for both the city and the citizens who lives there. Because the people who have strong interaction with streets are given to high-rise floors by lot thus their relation with streets is suspended. The people that live neighborhood in maximum level has suffered with moving to highrise bloks. Therefore it can be seen that, the old dwellers who continue to live after the project could not sustain their old lives. When individuals can not setup a correlation with places they can not reflect their identity to spaces. This situation cause loss of identitiy of spaces not in short term but in long term. Beside individuals, cities also affected from the applied regeneration projects. Because cities gain identity through citizens and their history. Cities begin to change identitiy when there is harm to these two fact. The urban project that is places nearby hıstorical city center should be planned as respecting to historical patterns and the effects of the rising noise, air and traffic pollution with this project should be minimized as much as can be. On the other hand Bursa Doganbey regeneration project aims to create over - loaded capacity density with high-rising buildings and without respecting to historical pattern. In the scope of the study, one of the most important criterias of regeneration projects; contribution of dwellers to the projects and unique planning according to characteristic of the area is examined and its success is evaluated. In the studied four districts where regeneration process applied, the changing of life-style for the dwellers, whether they still live there or not, suitablity of the project to the present dwellers and what kind of additions has been made to the project in order to prevent social difficulties and social stress are the main focal point of this research study. Consequently, possible social problems after the regeneration and negative effects of the new constructions on the historical city of Bursa silhouette and its pattern are discussed. In this situation,one of the most important values of the city of Bursa; historical pattern and silhouette is being affected in a negative way. In the scope of this thesis the effect and the impact of the urban regeneration project in the heart of historical city to city of Bursa is tried to be examined. By surveys that are prepared in the scope of pilot studies, interwiews are conducted with the dwellers who live before and after the regeneration and their satisfaction from the urban regeneration projects are revealed. The reason for dwellers to live in this area is the closeness to their works and it is in downtown. The dwellers own their properties as a heritage from their families or they are dwelling for low rents. Before the regeneration, the most disturbing fact is the old, corrupted and demolished structure of buildings for the people. Most of the dwellers live here since they born. Before the regeneration, even their houses was old, people say that they were happy because they were a owner of a house. Further more, they knew almost everbody in the neigbourhood and they were interacting with each other everyday. The users state that they were not shown any visuals about the project and the new constructions are too high therefore they are very anxious about the situation. But despite this they state that the regeneration project is a right decision for their area. They say they are happy about the project except its highrise constitution but they own a new flat. After the regeneration users indicate that they do not know anyone at the developments and lost their neighbourhood relationships. The users state that theywere living in a 1 - 2 floored garden house and moved to 22 - 23 floored apartments hence they could not sustain their prior life. When their opinion asked about the city they say the silhouette is not affected that much. In consequence, the public of the area was happy about their old life as well as the new situation after the urban regeneration project applied and they do not have any problem in accordance to the new environment. The people who live in the regeneration area, have two opposite ideas. First one is, the satisfaction before the regeneration project and the second one is the satisfacion after the regeneration project. They are glad from the two situations. This shows us, the outcomes of the regeneration project can be seen after all the dwellers move into the project area. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of a limited corpus, the author concludes that the {{idiolect}} of a woman from Belgrade, born in Dorćol in 1916, generally corresponds with descriptions of the Belgrade idiom from {{the first half of the}} twentieth century. The paper asserts: (a) that it has a four-accent system, but with optional preservation of falling accents after the first syllable (zapâmti, zami“sli), (b) that in the two-syllable words metataxis is present (že“na, čo“vek), (c) that there is no transmission of accents to the prepositions (na groblje, kod vas; na grob), whereas there is the optional shift to the verb negation (ne volite, ali i: ne la“žem, ne vi“dite, ne pîtam), (d) that a postaccentual length can generally appear after a short rising accent in the position šèšir, dèvōjka, although optional shortening (razùmeš, pòkažem) can also occur in this position, (e) that there is an optional shortening of long accented syllables (bo“lovi, na“meru), but no <b>lenghtening</b> of the short ones, except in emphasis (dûgo, dûgo), (f) that the non-discrimination of two pairs of affricates is preserved, i. e. that the pronunciation of [đdž] gospođdža appears somewhat harder and there is also a slightly softened articulation of [č‘] ve“č´e, č‘e“kaj; (e) that the accusative suppresses the locative with the prepositions na and u (on ne može da dubi na glavu), in addition to the proper use of the locative (još uvek sam bila sva u groznici). Our corpus has not confirmed: (a) the Balkan model of the future tense I (će kaže), but analytically one (ja ću da kleknem; a ona će da kaže), as well as the simple and the complex one (daću pa ću napisati treći), (b) the use of the preposition with with the instrumental of agency (strugala nožem). Although the earlier works have not referred to the use of the infinitive, we can conclude that it, along with various semantic groups of verbs, is completely suppressed by the da + present construction (ona nema običaj da priča; ja treba da odnesem; svi hoće da mi pomognu; nemojte da dolazite; obično volim da idem za Zadušnice, etc.). In addition, there are examples of postpositive use of the congruent future tense. (Ja nikad nisam rekla: tata, u životu mom, ni ja ni braća moja).

Fêmeas adultas obtidas após a última ecdise foram individualizadas em discos foliares dessas cultivares durante 24 horas e das ninfas produzidas, uma foi escolhida ao acaso para condução do experimento. Avaliaram-se também a densidade e os tipos de tricomas em cada cultivar. A JPM 781 - 88 - 3 permitiu o melhor desenvolvimento do pulgão, com uma produção diária de 4, 2 ± 0, 1 ninfas/fêmea e um total de 69, 2 ± 2, 1. Na cultivar IPEACO-SL 2261131, ocorreram um prolongamento da fase ninfal e redução na fecundidade, com uma média diária de 3, 0 ± 0, 3 ninfas/fêmea e um total de 54, 9 ± 2, 2 ninfas/fêmea. A cultivar Auburn SM 310 afetou o ciclo biológico desse afídeo, reduzindo a sua duração em relação às demais cultivares. Com relação aos tipos de tricomas, foram identificadas estruturas não glandulares de formas estreladas e glandulares, com predominância do primeiro tipo. As maiores densidades de tricomas não glandulares foram observadas nas cultivares Allen e IPEACO-SL 21 - 61131, enquanto os glandulares ocorreram em maior número nas cultivares JPM 78188 - 3 e Allen. Na Auburn SM 310, não foi encontrado nenhum tipo de tricoma.

40|$|For {{surgical}} treatment of urinary stress incontinence in women today are available many different surgical procedures. It confirms {{that none of}} them can successfuly cure all patients and achieve continents with the absence of new symptoms or side effects. Vaginal needle suspensions were developed during four decades and {{played an important role in}} the treatment of stress urinary incontinence. Worse long-term results,comparing to other methods,and new surgical procedures with better cure rate,beats his primacy few year ago. Suspending sutures are important part of every vaginal suspending operation and tension forces applyed to tyed them were mostly described by authors. The aims of this study were measuring the tying forces of suspending sutures,bladder neck replacement and increase in urethral lenght. Measuring are accomplish during two surgical procedures. One of them mobilise bladder neck (Raz) during operation,and another (Stamey) does not. Measuring were done od the end of the operation,in 60 patients, 50 of them were operated by Raz modification and 10 by Stamey modification. Preoperative evaluation were perfomed through SEAPI incontinence classification system. Suspension sutures tying force measuring were made with specialy developed dynamometar constructed from Procron stainless steel. Later we calculated tying forces from dynamometar extesion. Bladder neck replacement and increase in urethral length were calculated from catether marks measuring after suspension sutures were tyed. Average suspending sutures tying forces at Raz operation was 20, 91 N (14, 84 - 29, 06) with average blader neck suspension of 18, 4 mm(14 - 23) and urethral <b>lenghtening</b> of 8, 7 mm(6 - 12). Stamey operation have average tying forces 33, 08 N (27, 81 - 39, 44),bladder neck suspension 8, 3 mm(6 - 12) and urethral lenghthening 3, 2 mm(2 - 4) In early postoperative period,after catheter removal,urinary retention and urgencies are estimated. During follow-up period continence status,bladder empting ability and urgencies are clinicaly evaluated. Follow-up period was 10 years and 5 patients were lost from the study. After 10 years 14 (29, 7 %) patients with Raz operation were completely dry in every occasion and 10 (20, 3 %) patients have mild stress incontinence with severe stress maneuvers,but not with normal activities and no pads required. 19 (40, 6 %) patients were incontinent as before surgery or worse and 4 (8, 5 %) patients were incontinent but better than before surgery. Results with Stamey operations were significantly worse. None of 10 patiens were continent afther 10 years,two were continent afther 5 years but had failed during sixth year. Significant correlation between tying forces,bladder neck suspension and increase in urethral lenght with the result of treatment was not established. Inspite of such results several indicators connecting higher tying forces and treatment failure. Average tying forces was slightly higher in patients with recurrent stress incontinence compared with continent patients and percentage of continent patients was convinsigly higher among group with tying forces below mean value. Positive correlation between tying forces and degree of postoperative urgencies and negative correlation between postoperative urgencies and successful treatment support connection of tretment failure and higher tying forces. Three preoperative aspects have significant correlation with postoperative results. Subjective stress-related leak assessment and protection use have negative correlation with successful tretment,while ALPP confirm positive correlation. Urinary retentions and urgencies in early postoperative period have significant positive connection with tying forces of suspending sutures. The poorer long-term results of needle bladder neck suspensions were consequence of fascial damageing with suspending sutures tension and his loosing with stress incontinence recurrence. Suspending sutures tying forces would not exeed 20 N because higher forces can result with tissue damageing...|$|E
40|$|Après avoir indiqué les raisons d'ordre technique, économique et social du travail en équipes, l’auteur en expose les formes et l’organisation. Puis, il en souligne les principales difficultés familiales, sociales, et physiologiques. Enfin, il suggère des moyens pour améliorer la {{situation}} existante. INTRODUCTIONShift {{work more}} and more {{appears to be an}} economical necessity and seems to spread into many industrial sectors — almost everybody is submitted to it. However, it is necessary to have a better knowledge of the advantages and dangers of that kind of work in order to prevent and to palliate them. ITS CAUSESThe technical reasons that are the origin of that kind of work are well known. But economical factors are much more important and determine the actual growth of shift work — Those factors are :a) the cost of equipment is higher ;b) because of progress, equipment grows older more rapidly than its real depreciation. However there are a few social reasons for shift work :a) a few public services cannot be stopped ;b) the necessity of <b>lenghtening</b> opening hours of stores, etc. Shift work is thus a characteristic of an advanced period of the technical, economical and social evolution of industrial societies. ITS FORMSEven though that kind of work is quite used in large firms, note is to be taken that shift work has different forms depending of the industrial sector. The General Commisariate of the French Plan has published in its survey a graphic that clearly shows the mentioned differences.                                                                       TABLE I               THE DISTRIBUTION OF SHIFT-WORKERS IN THE INDUSTRIAL SECTORS                    Percentage of firms using                    % of wage earners working on                              shift work                                      shifts in every sector          Metal production                     60. 4                                55. 0           Textile industry                       39. 1                                37. 0           Paper industry                         35. 1                                29. 0           Chemical industry                     26. 1                                26. 0           Building material                     22. 0                                20. 0 As a general rule, let us say that in France, one wage-earner out of six works on shifts. Thus only a minority of wage-earners are implied in that kind of work ; however it is not an exception anymore limited to some industrial sectors. ITS ORGANIZATIONThat are mainly two sorts of shift work : the two team and the three team shift-work : 1) In the two team shift work, the system is quite homogeneous : only beginning and ending hours of work vary. The most fluently practiced time table is the following : 6 a. m. — 2 p. m. — morning team ; 2 p. m. — 10 p. m. — afternoon team. 2) In the three team shift work, in the textile industry, for example, the usual time tables are : 5 a. m. — 1 p. m. — morning team ; 1 p. m. — 9 p. m. — afternoon team ; 9 p. m. — 5 a. m. — night team. However, in the textile industry, the percentage of women employed brings out many difficulties. Three systems of organization exist : 1. —In the first system, the worker changes of shift each week. 2. —In the second, the order of succession of the shifts is different : from P. M. to A. M., from A. M. to night shift and from night shift to P. M. 3. —The third system officially requires three teams to cover the twenty four hours. In fact, this system needs four teams : three teams are working while the fourth is at rest. The complexity of three problems is in fact due to the difficulties and practices of each industry and is also due to the difficulties met in their application and to the preference of wage-earners to certain time tables. Those difficulties are at the same time :a) familial— change in normal life customs. — difficulties in practicing familial responsabilities. b) social— difficulties in keeping in relations with friends. — the shift-worker feels « social dead ». — he feels on the fringe of the union, the firm and society. — he cannot take advantage of formation and leisure program. c) physiological. The dangers of shift work are quite discussed. Note is to be taken that it has been proven that workers are more inclined to work on the morning shift than on any other shift. In fact, as Menzel puts it, there is a general deficiency of blood circulation during night time. On the other hand, daily rest, in order to be as complete and refreshing as night rest, would necessitate silence and lodging facilities that are quite rare at the present time especially in France. The following table on insomnia illustrates my idea :                                                  TABLE II                        WORKERS AFFECTED BY INSOMNIA                                                                                % affected by insomnia                                                                      Living at their                    Bad lodging                                                                           place                            conditions    Day-labourer                                                     12                                    18     Shift workers                                                      15                                    75     Day-labourer having been shift-worker                84                                    97 However, two points must be taken into consideration about women in the labor force :a) shift work is often imposed to them and, because of their non-unionization, it is difficult for them to resist ;b) night shift affects domestic duties of women. Note is to be taken that the major cause of physiological and nervous desiquilibrium is the frequent changes in time tables. Thus keeping the body from finding a regular life rythm so necessary. CONCLUSIONOne could solve the problem by using four teams instead of three : the night shift would not work more than four hours. To do so, it would be preferable to employ half time workers especially for those night shifts. The present situation could be ameliorated :a) by avoiding to ask workers living far from the firm or having bad lodgingconditions to work on night shifts ; b) by increasing medical supervision of these workers ;c) by avoiding to place on work shift those who cannot medically get adapted to it or older workers used to work daily on fixed time tables ;d) by making a special effort to give medical information to employers and wage earners on the dangers of changing time-tables. It seems that we are inclined to a greater use of this kind of work. We must try to adapt it to man. The contrary is impossible. Even economies will never modify physological laws. That is why research must be continued {{in order to determine the}} dangers of shift work. In addition to this, an information campaign must be undertaken in order to eliminate changing time-tables...|$|E
