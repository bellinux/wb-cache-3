On July26, she was hospitalized, citing [...] "extreme exhaustion" [...] and a [...] "physical and emotional breakdown". News websites and programs began reporting how Carey threatened to commit suicide by slitting her wrists the night before, and how Patricia, Carey's mother, hastily called for help. When questioned regarding Carey's suicidal rumor, Berger claimed she had broken dishes out of desperation, and as a result, accidentally cut her hands and feet. Carey was inducted at an un-disclosed hospital in Connecticut, and remained hospitalized and under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public. Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey's publicized breakdown and hospitalization, Virgin Records America and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of both Glitter, as well as its soundtrack of the same name.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by March 10, 2008 and was done {{alongside}} [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] and [...] "Cabin Fever".

[...] The flashforwards were written partially to explain what led Jack to become the drug addict {{that he is in}} third-season finale's flashforwards, who believes that his father is alive. [...] Matthew Fox stated that the fourth season is [...] "starting to close the loop on the end of [...] season. [...] Jack in the future is a man marked by weakness, but the Jack [...] is strong. [...] how he made that transition." [...] When asked why Hurley does not take drugs to see Charlie, but Jack starts his drug addiction to try not to see Christian, Edward Kitsis said that [...] "Jack has … always been a man of science, and there has to be something logical. [...] The scene where Jack is staring at the bench where Hurley sits when Charlie visits him, I think in that moment he's thinking, my <b>life</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> is pretty good, I don't want to end up here." [...] In regard to the contrast in Kate's character on the island and after the island, Kitsis said that [...] "you could say [...] motherhood suits her. [...] In the flashforwards … there's a sense of purpose to her, there's some clarity to her. [...] There's so much devotion to that child, and she appears to be such a great mother … taking care of Aaron may have helped her put away some other issues." ...|$|E
2500|$|Talking {{about the}} title track [...] "Louder", Michele has said, [...] "It's a song that, no matter what, I can play in my car with the windows down.

I {{want to make sure}} that every song on my record is fun and enjoyable, but also, you hear my voice in them." [...] Michele also stated, [...] "I didn't want to find songs that I had to change myself for. I wanted to find songs that would only highlight my sound and were unique to me. I didn't want to fit any mold. I wanted it to be something that couldn't be replicated by anyone else. It was important to me that the album began with [...] "Cannonball" [...] and ended with [...] "If You Say So". I have to acknowledge what I've been through this year. It was really difficult, which I think is represented in [...] "If You Say So" [...] and a song like [...] "Cannonball" [...] represents finding strength and hope. These are the two sides of my <b>life</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> The grief, but also the search for strength and hope. I really wanted those two songs to bookend the album. Really let everyone know where I'm at." ...|$|E

500|$|Mace {{was seen}} as a strong yet very {{feminine}} female character, as she often rescues Lenny in dire situations and shows maternal concern for him. Both characters represent a significant contrast: Mace is the film's hero and moral center, whereas Lenny is the antihero; Mace is black and Lenny is white; and finally, Mace represents the [...] "hard-edged, reality-based" [...] component, while Lenny is dominated by fantasies. This is especially notable when Mace yells to him, [...] "This is your <b>life!</b> <b>Right</b> here! <b>Right</b> <b>now!</b> It's real time, you hear me? Real time, time to get real, not playback!" [...] The film's white characters also tend to be nihilistically concerned with the present, while black characters are generally future revolutionaries.

6000|$|His want of chivalry {{was beyond}} dispute. And was there not also an {{extraordinary}} egotism in this concentration upon his own purposes, a self-esteem, a vanity?

Solomonson had been at his old theme with him, a theme the little man had never relinquished since their friendship first began years ago, possibilities of a business alliance {{and the application of}} a mind of exceptional freshness and penetration to industrial development.

2500|$|In April 2012, an Internet meme [...] "Texts from Hillary", hosted on Tumblr {{and based}} around a {{photograph}} of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone, imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It became suddenly popular and earned the endorsement of Clinton herself, before being brought to an end by its creators. Obama himself took note of the meme's popularity, in a humorous exchange that revealed the ease the two now had around one another. Around the same time, a photograph taken during the 6th Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, showed Clinton {{with a group of}} colleagues relaxing, drinking Águila beer from a bottle and dancing, at a local nightclub. The episode gained front-page attention from the New York Post and illustrated how Clinton was enjoying the job. Regarding her ongoing popularity, Clinton said, [...] "There's a certain consistency to who I am and what I do, and I think people have finally said, 'Well, you know, I kinda get her now.'" [...] One long-time Washington figure summarized the situation by simply saying, [...] "There's no coin in criticizing her anymore." [...] At the same time, her fashion choices gained renewed attention, with her hair grown long and sometimes pulled back with scrunchies. Public commentary on Clinton's hair was now a tradition across twenty years, but as one female State Department traveller said, [...] "As a chick, it's a big pain in the butt. The weather is different, and you’re {{in and out of the}} plane. [...] gets off that plane looking like garbage most days, but she has to look camera ready. She said the reason she grew her hair long was that it's easier. She has options." [...] Clinton professed she was past the point of concern on the matter: [...] "I feel so relieved to be at the stage I'm at in my <b>life</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> [...] because if I want to wear my glasses, I'm wearing my glasses. If I want to pull my hair back, I'm pulling my hair back." [...] In any case, Clinton showed a much more relaxed attitude vis a vis the press than in past eras.|$|E

40|$|The {{best time}} of my <b>life</b> is <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> This is the last page written, not the last page but the page written last. In my preface I {{would like to thank}} the whole class of 2014. They made my aca-demic year a ride that I enjoyed so much. The class had so much {{potential}} from day one, and the potential is cashing in on the last days when most of us are returning their Thesis. The starting point of this Thesis was to design a portal to support calibration business process-es. During the current state analysis it became clear that a tool for a process that has not yet been defined clear enough is not possible. So a process had to be developed first. When think-ing about a process, many things come to mind. The modelling of business processes is not so simple and straightforward as one could imagine. But the actual presentation of the process is the hardest one. The modelling of sales process is difficult enough, but when it is a really differ-ent than the normal sales process, I found it my biggest learning from this project how to pre-sent it so that it would be clear enough. Luckily, my case company has great experts who were eager to share their experience so I received help from them to shape this common vision. The best thing about this whole project was the support from both case company and my su-pervisor, Dr Juha Haimala. I would like to thank him for this patience and insightful suggestions that helped to find the right way. I must add an additional thank you to my future wife who I am engaged to in November. She has supported me at home in the way nobody could...|$|R
