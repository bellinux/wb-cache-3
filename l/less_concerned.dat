5|$|In {{the decades}} that followed, the Ministerium became <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> with its {{relationship}} with the Reformed church and saw a significant increase in Lutheran identity and the importance of the Lutheran Confessions. Thus, in 1853, the Ministerium rejoined other Lutherans in the General Synod. However, this renewed relationship would prove to be short-lived.|$|E
5|$|Back at home, Quisling was now <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> about Nasjonal Samling's {{membership}} and even wanted action {{to clean up}} the membership list, including purging it of drunkards. On 12 March, Norway officially became a one-party state. In time, criticism of, and resistance to, the party was criminalised, though Quisling expressed regret for having to take this step, hoping that every Norwegian would freely come around to accept his government.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, {{around the}} time of U2's second, spiritually charged album, October, a rift was created in the band between Clayton and McGuinness, and the three other band members. Bono, The Edge, and Mullen had joined a Christian group, and were {{questioning}} the compatibility of rock music with their spirituality. However, Clayton, with his more ambiguous religious views, was <b>less</b> <b>concerned,</b> and so was more of an outsider.|$|E
5|$|Rodin was a naturalist, <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> with monumental {{expression}} {{than with}} character and emotion. Departing with centuries of tradition, {{he turned away}} from the idealism of the Greeks, and the decorative beauty of the Baroque and neo-Baroque movements. His sculpture emphasized the individual and the concreteness of flesh, and suggested emotion through detailed, textured surfaces, and the interplay of light and shadow. To a greater degree than his contemporaries, Rodin believed that an individual's character was revealed by his physical features.|$|E
5|$|Arrangers called gamemasters (GMs) {{determine}} {{the rules and}} setting of a LARP, and may also influence an event and act as referees while it is taking place. The GMs may also do the logistical work, or {{there may be other}} arrangers who handle details such as advertising the event, booking a venue, and financial management. Unlike the GM in a tabletop role-playing game, a LARP GM seldom has an overview of everything that is happening during play because numerous participants may be interacting at once. For this reason, a LARP GM's role is often <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> with tightly maintaining a narrative or directly entertaining the players, and more with arranging the structure of the LARP before play begins and facilitating the players and crew to maintain the fictional environment during play.|$|E

5|$|Despite his equestrian background, Macrinus was {{accepted}} by the Senate for two reasons: {{for the removal of}} Caracalla, and for having received the loyalty of the army. The senators were <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> by Macrinus' Mauretanian ancestry than by his equestrian social background and scrutinized his actions as emperor. Their opinion of him was reduced by his decisions to appoint men to high offices who were of similarly undistinguished background. Only the Senate had the constitutional power to choose the emperor from among the senators and Macrinus, not being a senator and having become emperor through force rather than through traditional means, was looked down upon.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{disease is}} listed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services {{as the number}} one {{cause of death for}} all women. Factors that add to risk of heart disease include obesity and smoking, both of which are more {{prevalent}} in lesbians. Studies show that lesbians have a higher body mass and are generally <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> about weight issues than heterosexual women, and lesbians consider women with higher body masses to be more attractive than heterosexual women do. Lesbians are more likely to exercise regularly than heterosexual women, and lesbians do not generally exercise for aesthetic reasons, although heterosexual women do. Research is needed to determine specific causes of obesity in lesbians.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane {{establishes}} {{the book as}} a work of normative political theory asking to what extent animals {{should be included in the}} domain of justice. States can and do regulate human-animal relationships, whether the animals in question are used in agriculture, as companions, or in some other way. Cochrane's focus is not on why laws are passed or on comparing laws, but in exploring what kind of laws should be passed. As his focus is on political theory, he is <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> with questions about individual moral obligations than he is with institutional arrangements. He notes, however, that questions about animals have been neglected in political theory. In the second chapter, Cochrane considers the history of thinking on the relationship between justice and animals. He argues that within ancient philosophy there was disagreement about the inclusion of animals within accounts of justice, in medieval Christian philosophy there was a consensus that they should be excluded, and in modern philosophy there has been a return to disagreement.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{aggressive}} tactics of Haywood and the IWW, {{along with their}} call for abolition of the wage system and the overthrow of capitalism created tension with moderate electorally-oriented leaders of the Socialist Party. Haywood and the IWW focused on direct action and strikes, which often led to violence, and were <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> with political tactics. When Haywood was quoted speaking at public meetings in New York City {{to the effect that}} he had never advocated the use of the ballot by the workers but had instead favored the tactics of direct action, an initiative recalling Haywood from the NEC was launched by the State Executive Committee of the Socialist Party of New York. In February 1913 the recall of Haywood was approved by a margin of more than 2-to-1. Following his defeat, Haywood left the ranks of the Socialist Party, joined by thousands of other IWW members and their sympathizers.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the month}} of July, the Autodromo Nazionale Monza race track's main {{straight}} was straightened and the Variante Goodyear and Seconda Variante chicanes were reconfigured by the race organisers to become a series of narrower corners with the exit away from the entry of turn one. The run-off areas around the two sections of the circuit were enlargened. Some of the drivers, however, were unhappy with the modifications, though, as there were fears of a multi-car accident on the first lap. Coulthard claimed that the new corner would make braking more difficult and was concerned over the amount of penalties issued to other competitors. However, Michael Schumacher believed his and other teams would be <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> with suspension damage. Jean Alesi {{who was the first}} driver to test the new circuit, said that it would be easier for drivers to pull off the track {{in the event of a}} technical issue.|$|E
5|$|The Liber {{is one of}} {{a number}} of monastic {{histories}} written during the middle and later 12th century, when a number of monasteries in northern and southern England produced works devoted to recording the histories of their religious houses and local areas. In the south, these included the Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis of Abingdon Abbey, the Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis of Ramsey Abbey, the Chronicon Angliae Petriburgense of Peterborough Abbey, a history of the see of Bath and Wells, and the Chronicon Monasterii de Bello of Battle Abbey. The northern histories record the foundation stories of the various Cistercian houses in the north, along with other information relating to those houses. Those from the south, including the Liber Eliensis, mainly concern themselves with the various controversies involving their respective religious houses. The northern histories are <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> with controversy, and overall are more prone to hagiography.|$|E

5|$|This revival did {{not last}} long. Following the death of Charles of Anjou in 1285 {{and the end of}} the threat of an {{invasion}} from Italy, Michael's successor Andronikos II Palaiologos (1282–1328) assumed that, by relying on the naval strength of his Genoese allies, he could do without the maintenance of a fleet, whose particularly heavy expenditure the increasingly cash-strapped treasury could no longer afford. At the same time, Andronikos was <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> with the West and more with affairs in Asia Minor and his—eventually futile—attempt to stop the Turkish advance there, a policy where the fleet lacked a role. Consequently, the entire fleet was disbanded, its crews dismissed and the ships broken up or left to rot. The results were quick to follow: during Andronikos' long reign, the Turks gradually took permanent possession of the Aegean coasts of Anatolia, with the Empire unable to reverse the situation, while the Venetian fleet was able to attack Constantinople and raid its suburbs at will during the 1296–1302 war.|$|E
5|$|While {{walking in}} the woods, Andrei and Foma have a {{conversation}} about Foma’s faults, especially lying. Foma confesses to taking honey from the bee garden, after Andrei notices his cassock is tacky, and smears mud on his face to soothe a bee sting. While Foma has talent as an artist, he is <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> with the deeper meaning of his work and more concerned with practical aspects of the job, like perfecting his azure, a colour which in painting was often considered unstable to mix. They encounter Theophanes in the forest, and the old master sends Foma away. As he leaves, the apprentice finds a dead swan and pokes at it with a stick. We cut to banks of a stream where Andrei and Theophanes are arguing about religion, while Foma cleans his master's paint brushes. Theophanes argues that the ignorance of the Russian people is due to stupidity, while Andrei says that he doesn’t understand how {{he can be a}} painter and maintain such views. This section contains a reenactment of Christ's Crucifixion on a snow-covered hillside which plays out as Andrei recounts the story and expresses his belief that the men who crucified Jesus were obeying God's will and loved him.|$|E
