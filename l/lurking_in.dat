5|$|In Southeast Asia, the {{importance}} of the sea gave rise to many myths of epic ocean voyages, princesses on distant islands, monsters and magical fish <b>lurking</b> <b>in</b> the deep. In Northern Europe, kings were sometimes given ship burials when the body was laid in a vessel surrounded by treasure and costly cargo and set adrift on the sea. In North America, various creation stories have a duck or other creature dive {{to the bottom of the}} sea and bring up some mud out of which the dry land was formed. Atargatis was a Syrian deity known as the mermaid-goddess and Sedna was the goddess of the sea and marine animals in Inuit mythology.|$|E

At the camp, they start singing songs, but are soon attacked by an unseen figure <b>lurking</b> <b>in</b> the woods, and their fates are left unknown.|$|E

This round tarn occupies a corrie beneath Hanging Knotts, small trout <b>lurking</b> <b>in</b> its 50-foot depths.|$|E

25|$|One such {{rescue mission}} {{occurred}} on 26 March 1942. A Socony tanker, , was torpedoed off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and Tarbells lookouts sighted her distress flares {{a little before}} 0900. The destroyer instantly rang up full speed; and, one-half hour later, {{she arrived at the}} scene of the attack. She dropped a depth charge barrage to drive off any U-boats <b>lurking</b> <b>in</b> the vicinity and then picked up 22 survivors. After a futile search for the enemy submarine, she disembarked the survivors at Morehead City, North Carolina.|$|E
25|$|To the north-west of Bowfell {{the main}} ridge {{drops to the}} {{depression}} of Ore Gap, named after its reddish soil, rich in haematite. Below the col on the northern side is Angle Tarn. This round waterbody occupies a corrie beneath Hanging Knotts, small trout <b>lurking</b> <b>in</b> its 50ft depths. Its outflow is {{a tributary of the}} Langstrath Beck, making for Stonethwaite. To the south of Ore Gap runs Yeastyrigg Gill, the main headwater of Lingcove Beck, flowing into the fastness of upper Eskdale. Beyond the Gap the ridge makes the stony three-tiered climb to the white-rocked summit of Esk Pike.|$|E
25|$|A narrow ridge falls north {{east from}} Bow Fell, {{constricted}} between Angle Tarn and the steep defile of Rossett Gill rising up from Mickleden. Angle Tarn is a feeder of the Langstrath and occupies a circular corrie beneath Hanging Knotts, small trout <b>lurking</b> <b>in</b> its 50ft depths. Beyond this pinch point the ridge steps {{down over the}} three tops of Rossett Pike, Buck Pike (1,988ft) and Black Crag (1,929ft).

Kouprasith's men seized the radio station and various strategic points in the town. He announced his allegiance to Souvanna Phouma, and his opposition to Kong Le.

25|$|On {{the night}} of 7 September, the Pakistan Navy {{launched}} its assault on Western Indian shores. Dwarka was chosen for its proximity (200km from Karachi Port), its lower defences and historical relevance. The plan called for a fleet of 7 naval vessels of Pakistan to bomb {{the tiny town of}} Dwarka. It was aimed at luring the heavy ships anchored in Bombay into attacking the Pakistani ships. The intention was that the submarine PNS Ghazi <b>lurking</b> <b>in</b> the Arabian Sea would then engage and sink the Indian ships. Accordingly, a fleet of seven ships comprising PNS Babur, PNS Khaibar, PNS Badr, PNS Jahangir, PNS Alamgir, PNS Shah Jahan and PNS Tipu Sultan set sail for Dwarka and bombarded the town.|$|E
