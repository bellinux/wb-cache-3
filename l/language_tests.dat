2500|$|The {{rapid growth}} in {{diversity}} of {{school districts in the}} United States has proven that there is an increasing need for new guidelines and standards to be put into practice in able to provide nondiscriminatory assessment procedures to students. [...] Although there is no clear-cut way to appropriately evaluate bias in the assessment of students who are culturally and linguistically diverse, the examiner must carefully consider each situation individually in order to develop an appropriate hypothesis {{that can be used in}} the testing procedure. [...] In developing a hypothesis the school psychologist must eliminate any personal or professional bias that may affect their ability to make informative decisions based on the psychometric data obtained during the assessment process. [...] Best practices prove that school psychologists who are culturally and linguistic competent are more effective in communicating to the individual or student in their native language and thus, eliminating the need for an interpreter. [...] The use of standardized testing also must be taken into account when assessing those who are of minority and lower socioeconomic status since they are so culturally loaded. [...] One must be able to recognize that the difference between the scores is not actually related to the ability or aptitude of the child, but to the incorrect interpretations that have been made based on the result of the scores and the significantly different standardized sample. [...] Another important factor in nondiscriminatory assessment is the ability for a school psychologist to recognize the difference in a bilingual assessment and how to assess bilingual individuals. [...] The apparent preference lies in using well-constructed, theoretically comprehensive, native <b>language</b> <b>tests</b> to non-native test takers rather than using limited and poor tests that are available in the test taker's native language.|$|E

40|$|This study {{identifies}} {{a unique}} context for exploring lay understandings of <b>language</b> <b>testing,</b> {{and by extension}} for characterising the nature of language assessment literacy among non-practitioners, stemming from data in an inquiry into the registration processes and support for overseas trained doctors by the Australian House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing. The data come from Hansard transcripts of public hearings of the inquiry. Sections of the data related to <b>language</b> and <b>language</b> <b>testing</b> (as part of the current registration process for doctors seeking employment in Australia) were identified and coded using a thematic analysis. Findings reveal misconceptions about {{who is responsible for}} tests and for decisions based on scores in this context, as well as misconceptions about <b>language</b> <b>testing</b> procedures. Issues also emerge concerning the location of expertise in <b>language</b> and <b>language</b> <b>testing.</b> Discussion of these findings contributes to current debate within the <b>language</b> <b>testing</b> community (e. g., Taylor, 2009) about where responsibility lies for increasing language assessment literacy among non-practitioner stakeholders, and how this might best be achieved...|$|R
