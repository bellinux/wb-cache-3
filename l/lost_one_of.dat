5|$|After {{falling out}} of favor with Ali Pasha, for reasons unknown, Meksi left the court in 1810 to travel around Europe. During a brief stay in Venice he began to develop an {{interest}} in the Albanian alphabet and grammar. He published two translations into Albanian during 1814, both now <b>lost,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> which was a religious work by Abbé Claude Fleury (1640–1723).|$|E

5|$|Isaac Perrins was an English bareknuckle prizefighter and 18th-century engineer.

Such was the mismatch that Perrins was described as Hercules fighting a boy.|$|E

5|$|As Duckworth {{gathered}} his squadron, Northumberlands mainmast collapsed across the deck, causing severe {{damage to the}} ship's fittings. Although Cochrane's flagship was the most severely damaged of the squadron, all had suffered to a degree: Superbs men counted 60 shot holes while Atlas {{was out of control}} and Donegal had <b>lost</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> her topmasts. Casualties were also distributed throughout the fleet, with Northumberland and Spencer suffering the worst and Atlas the least except for the barely engaged Agamemnon. Total losses were 74 killed and 264 wounded and several ships were damaged, but Duckworth was rapidly able to effect repairs as his ships remained on station to observe the situation ashore.|$|E
5|$|Baron Pierre De Coubertin {{stepped down}} {{as head of the}} Olympic Movement after 1925 and with his {{departure}} the sport <b>lost</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> its major advocates. In 1928 the IOC turned down a request to stage rugby at the Amsterdam games. An exhibition tournament was held at the 1936 Berlin Games, with France, Germany, Italy and Romania competing. In what was, to date, the last rugby match played at the Olympics, France beat Germany in the final 19 to 14.|$|E
5|$|Between 23 and 27 May {{and again}} 30 May 1951, New Jersey pounded targets near Yangyang and Kansong, {{dispersing}} troop concentrations, dropping a bridge span, and destroying three large ammunition dumps.

On 24 May, she <b>lost</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> her helicopters after the crew pushed their chopper to the limit of its fuel searching for a downed aviator. The helicopter crew was able to reach friendly territory and were later returned to their ship.|$|E

5|$|The Reform Act's chief {{objective}} was {{the reduction of}} the number of nomination boroughs. There were 203 boroughs in England before the Act. The 56 smallest of these, as measured by their housing stock and tax assessments, were completely abolished. The next 30 smallest boroughs each <b>lost</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> their two MPs. In addition Weymouth and Melcombe Regis's four members were reduced to two. Thus in total the Act abolished 143 borough seats in England (one of the boroughs to be completely abolished, Higham Ferrers, had only a single representative).|$|E
5|$|Once half-time was reached, it {{was clear}} that Scotland, and Jim Leighton in particular, were in difficulty. In the {{dressing}} room, Leighton admitted that the reason he had missed the cross {{at the end of the}} first half, which led to the last-ditch save at the feet of Mark Hughes, was that he was shortsighted and had <b>lost</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his contact lenses. Not only that, but he did not have a spare pair with him. Leighton had not been forthcoming about his eyesight because of fears that it might harm his career. As a consequence, that the goalkeeper even needed lenses was something that his team mates, Alex Ferguson (who was also Leighton's club manager at Aberdeen) or, most importantly, Jock Stein did not know.|$|E
5|$|The British {{reaction}} was immediate: ships were dispatched from regional bases at Madras, the Cape of Good Hope and Rodriguez to replace Rowley's losses while a larger force was collected at Rodriguez {{in preparation for}} a major invasion of Isle de France intended to permanently eliminate the island as a raiding base. The French response from their squadron on Isle de France, based at Port Napoleon under Commodore Jacques Hamelin, was to exercise their regional superiority by attacking British reinforcements at the actions of 13 September 1810 and 18 September 1810. Despite inflicting severe damage on two British frigates, the French <b>lost</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> their own, captured with Hamelin aboard, and suffered two more damaged. Without supplies or reinforcements to replace these losses, the French were unable to resist the British invasion in November 1810 and the island fell within four days.|$|E

5|$|The First Prussian Uprising was {{influenced}} by three major events. Firstly, the Teutonic Knights lost the Battle of the Ice on Lake Peipus to Alexander Nevsky in April 1242. Secondly, southern Poland was devastated by a Mongol invasion in 1241; Poland lost the Battle of Legnica and the Teutonic Knights <b>lost</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> its most trusted allies that often supplied troops. Thirdly, Duke Swantopolk II of Pomerania was fighting against the Knights, who supported his brothers' dynastic claims against him. It has been implied that the new castles of the Knights were competing with his lands over the trade routes along the Vistula River. While some historians embrace the Swantopolk–Prussian alliance without hesitation, others are more careful. They {{point out that the}} historical information came from documents written by the Teutonic Knights and must have been ideologically charged to persuade the Pope to declare a crusade not only against the pagan Prussians but also against the Christian duke.|$|E
5|$|Bräck {{closed the}} gap with de Ferran over the next fifteen laps as they moved towards slower cars. Bräck got a run on de Ferran and overtook him {{at the bottom of}} the first turn to take over the lead on lap 46, while Andretti lost fourth place to Franchitti on the same lap. Jourdain spun leaving turn four because of his car {{generating}} oversteer, and slid down the frontstretch triggering the second caution on the 50th lap. Franchitti drove to the outside of the track in avoidance. Castroneves avoided hitting Jourdain's car, which remained {{at the bottom of the}} first turn and, though his vehicle <b>lost</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> its shock covers, he regained control of his car and continued. Fittipaldi reported to his team that he had a problem with either his gearbox or drivetrain and drove slowly into the pit lane on lap 53 becoming the race's second retirement. The leaders elected to make pit stops on the same lap under caution. Da Matta gained the most positions, moving from sixth to third, and Bräck remained the leader at the lap-57 restart. Bräck pulled away from the rest of the field, until de Ferran {{closed the gap}} between them by the start of the 80th lap.|$|E
5|$|During February and March 1942, the RAAF formed four {{transport}} units: Nos.33, 34, 35 and 36Squadrons. No.34 (Transport) Squadron {{was established}} on 23February at RAAF Station Darwin, Northern Territory, {{four days after}} the city was bombed for the first time. Coming under the control of North-Western Area Command, the squadron's initial strength was six personnel and two deHavilland DH.84 Dragons. They were immediately tasked with transport duties in northern Australia. As well as carrying freight, this involved collecting the first Japanese prisoner of war to be captured in Australia, a navy fighter pilot who had crashlanded during the raid on Darwin. One of the squadron's two officers, Flight Lieutenant J.W. Warwick, became the first (acting) commanding officer on 2March. The following day, one of the Dragons was destroyed on the ground at Wyndham, Western Australia, by enemy air attack. With its other aircraft unserviceable, and accommodation at Darwin's civil airfield inadequate, squadron headquarters relocated to Daly Waters Airfield on 5March. On 14March another Dragon was allocated; this was joined by two Avro Ansons and two de Havilland Tiger Moths in mid-May, by which time the squadron had moved to Batchelor Airfield. By the end of the month, the squadron had thirty-four personnel, including six officers. It <b>lost</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the Tiger Moths to a bushfire on 1July, {{a few days after the}} plane crashlanded south of Katherine. The squadron relocated again on 15July, this time to Hughes Airfield. It remained at Hughes until 27August, when it transferred to Manbulloo Airfield; it operated from Manbulloo until it was temporarily disbanded on 13December and its aircraft transferred to No.6 Communications Flight.|$|E

5|$|In 2008 Averno {{formed the}} group Los Hijos del Averno ("The Sons of Hell") {{alongside}} Mephisto and Ephesto, followed by Averno and Mephisto defeating Atlantis and Último Guerrero {{to win the}} CMLL World Tag Team Championship for a second time. On September 17, 2008 Averno defeated Negro Casas to win the CMLL World Middleweight Championship, becoming a double middleweight champion as he still held the NWA World Middleweight Championship. Their reign lasted only 38 days before Místico and Héctor Garza won the championship from them. The duo became three-time tag team champions {{by the end of}} the year as Averno and Mephisto defeated Místico and Garza on December 7, 2008. The duo's third run with the CMLL World Tag Teams Championship ended on January 16, 2009 when they lost to La Sombra and Volador Jr. On July 22, Averno <b>lost</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his middleweight championships, the CMLL World Middleweight Championship, to Hijo del Fantasma. On July 12, 2010, at the Promociones Gutiérrez 1st Anniversary Show Averno participated in a match where 10 men put their mask on the line in a match that featured five pareja incredibles teams, with the losing team being forced to wrestle each other with their mask on the line. His partner in the match was Último Guerrero, facing off against the teams of Atlantis and Olímpico, Místico and El Oriental, Histeria and La Sombra, Volador, Jr. and El Alebrije. Averno and Último Guerrero was the third team to escape the match. In mid 2010 CMLL abandoned the NWA World Middleweight Championship after repeated complaints from the National Wrestling Alliance, instead they created the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship and made Averno the first champion. Averno was one of 14 men putting their masks on the line in a Lucha de Apuestas steel cage match, the main event of the CMLL 77th Anniversary Show. Averno was the first man to leave the steel cage with all three members of Los Hijos del Averno quickly leaving the cage, keeping their masks safe.|$|E
5|$|The Yom Kippur War {{ended on}} October 24. 69 Squadron had flown 789 sorties, had lost 9 aircraft, and had shot down 10 enemy aircraft. Four airmen {{had been killed}} and eight had become prisoners of war. The end of the war, however, did not spell {{an end to the}} fighting. On December 6, a mixed 69 and 119 squadrons combat air patrol over the Gulf of Suez engaged a flight of MiG-21s to score one kill, {{possibly}} two. The kill was credited to 69's Yiftach Shadmi and Meir Gur, with the MiG-21s revealed {{to be a part of}} a North Korean contingent that had deployed to Egypt during the war. With the arrival of spring fighting also resumed in the north, where Israel and Syria had yet to sign a disengagement agreement. On April 8, 1974, while on patrol against low flying Syrian helicopters, the squadron <b>lost</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> its aircraft, probably to a shoulder-launched SA-7. The crew, Shadmi and Rafaeli, were interned in Lebanon for a month. Three weeks later, on April 29, the squadron scored two aerial kills against Syrian MiG-21s, the squadron's final victories to date. Fighting only ceased on May 31.|$|E
