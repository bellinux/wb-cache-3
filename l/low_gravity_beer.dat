Although not necessary for <b>low</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>beers</b> as the grains commonly used in brewing already provide adequate zinc. It is a more common practice when pushing yeast to their limit by increasing alcohol content beyond their comfort zone. Before modern stainless steel brew kettles and fermenting vessels and after wood, zinc was slowly leeched by the use of copper kettles. A modern copper immersion chiller is speculated to provide trace elements of zinc. Be careful when adding supplemental zinc to not overdo it.

50|$|Since its creation, ELGRA has {{continuously}} {{encouraged and}} promoted <b>low</b> <b>gravity</b> research in both life and physical sciences within Europe with the permanent {{support of the}} European Space Agency. For several years ELGRA was a study group of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and contributed to a better visibility of <b>Low</b> <b>Gravity</b> research at the highest European spheres. However, its main action remains {{the improvement of the}} scientific collaboration between scientists from all over Europe in the field of <b>low</b> <b>gravity</b> research. In that effort, ELGRA has organized meetings and symposia resulting in 2011 in the 22nd ELGRA symposium held in Antwerp (Belgium) which gathered more than 150 scientists from all over the world. ELGRA also supports young researchers and students via grants and educational programs from ESA. In 2012, the ELGRA community counts not less than 200 active members. The success of ELGRA reflects the increasing interest of the European scientific community for <b>low</b> <b>gravity.</b> Since the 80s, ELGRA's scientists have been using new research facilities either on the ground, as the 133m drop tower at ZARM (Bremem, Germany) or centrifuges (ESTEC, DLR, MEDES), but also in space with the European Columbus module aboard the International Space Station dedicated to <b>low</b> <b>gravity</b> research. Nowadays, <b>low</b> <b>gravity</b> space research involves more and more scientists from all over Europe and space experiments require more preparation and especially a strong collaboration between the different partners.

Three tube diameters are tested: 6. 0, 4. 0, and 2. 0 mm. With respect to terrestrial gravity, both heat transfer rate enhancement (up to 15 – 20 %) and deterioration (up to 35 %) have been observed.
