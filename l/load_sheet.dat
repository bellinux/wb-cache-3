As {{the doors were}} about to close, Coleman asked Key to accommodate a BEA flight crew that had to collect a Merchantman aircraft from Brussels. The additional weight of the three crew members necessitated the removal of a quantity of mail and freight from the Trident to ensure its total weight (less fuel) did not exceed the permitted maximum of 41,730kg. This was exceeded by 24kg, but as there had been considerable fuel burnoff between startup and takeoff, the total aircraft weight (including fuel) was within the maximum permitted take-off weight.|$|E

50|$|According to the <b>load</b> <b>sheet</b> of Flight 601, {{the flight}} {{took off with}} a takeoff mass of 5,834 kg and an {{estimated}} landing mass of 5,698 kg. The <b>load</b> <b>sheet</b> indicated that no luggage had been loaded, surveillance videos however showed luggage of about 80 kg was loaded and not removed before the aircraft departed the stand. Thus the takeoff weight was corrected to 5,914 kg while using Nepal's standard weights for passengers, thus the aircraft was overloaded. However, overloading alone can not explain the performance problem, as further analysis revealed that a grossly overloaded aircraft {{would have had a}} better performance than 9N-AHA during the accident flight.|$|E

40|$|International audienceField {{measurements}} indicate that, in {{gravel bed}} rivers, bed load {{may not be}} a one-to-one response to shear stress but may instead fluctuate a great deal over time for a given flow condition. Both in flume and field experiments, these fluctuations were often associated with migration of low-relief bed forms called bed load sheets. Whereas several studies have described bed load sheets as a consequence of grain sorting, {{little is known about the}} mechanisms responsible for their production and migration. These were investigated in flume experiments. A set of 20 experiments was conducted under constant feeding rate conditions, with mixtures of different uniform sediments and for slopes varying from 0. 8 to 9 %. Except for runs performed in high flow conditions, we observed periodic bed <b>load</b> <b>sheet</b> production and migration associated with fluctuations of bed slope, bed state (bed fining and paving), and bed load. Observations allowed us to conclude that bed load sheets resulted from very efficient vertical and longitudinal grain sorting that produced periodic local bed aggradation and erosion clearly observed in the upstream section of the flume. Fractional transport rates were measured in one run. Combined with the results of experiments previously conducted by authors with uniform sediments, this experiment showed that the highest (peak) solid discharges were essentially caused by the much greater mobility of the coarser gravels when transported within bed load sheets. A scenario is proposed for the mechanisms involved in bed <b>load</b> <b>sheet</b> production and migration...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{three-dimensional}} two-phase flow solver, SedFoam- 2. 0, is presented for sediment transport applications. The solver is extended from twoPhaseEulerFoam {{available in the}} 2. 1. 0 release of the open-source CFD (computational fluid dynamics) toolbox OpenFOAM. In this approach the sediment phase is modeled as a continuum, and constitutive laws have to be prescribed for the sediment stresses. In the proposed solver, two different intergranular stress models are implemented: the kinetic theory of granular flows and the dense granular flow rheology μ (I). For the fluid stress, laminar or turbulent flow regimes can be simulated and three different turbulence models are available for sediment transport: a simple mixing length model (one-dimensional configuration only), a k [*]−[*] ε, and a k [*]−[*] ω model. The numerical implementation is demonstrated on four test cases: sedimentation of suspended particles, laminar bed <b>load,</b> <b>sheet</b> flow, and scour at an apron. These test cases illustrate the capabilities of SedFoam- 2. 0 to deal with complex turbulent sediment transport problems with different combinations of intergranular stress and turbulence models...|$|E

Two sheets are welded together at points, rather than entire area of contact between the parts. New concept namely indirect resistance spot welding was developed for applications where the surface appearance on sheet can be critical. In this process outer surface, limiting the extent of electrode indentation is traditionally managed by controlling the heat balance and electrode size. Design of experiment approach where 23 factorial designs were used. The three factors selected are weld force weld current and weld time and each factor was varied with two Levels. Tension shear load were taken for response. Direct and indirect resistance spot welding trials were conducted and regression equations were obtained. The effect of parameters on Tension shear breaking load was analyzed [...] The observations on Tension, shear load were discussed [...] Failure behaviour was analyzed after every test. Since spot welds during service are expected to perform well under different loading conditions these results will be useful for optimum design.
