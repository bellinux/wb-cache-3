40|$|Two {{series of}} single-lap, single-bolt {{composite}} joints were tested to failure in tension. The principal {{difference between them}} was the <b>lap</b> <b>thickness</b> (T). The 36 first series joints had T = 3. 2 mm and the 45 second series joints had T = 6. 4 mm laps. The joint layouts were {{defined in terms of}} their end distance to hole diameter (E/D) and width to hole diameter (W/D) ratios. The former ranged from 1. 5 to 4 and the latter from 3 to 5. The individual and mean joint test data, presented in graphical format, comprise ultimate loads, strengths, strains and efficiencies (the latter based on ultimate strength) for the range of E/D ratios and specific W/D ratios. For the larger E/D ratios the thicker lap joints have ultimate loads about twice those of their thinner counterparts, whereas their ultimate strengths are only about 20 % higher. The ultimate strains exhibit rather less clear trends, though strains up to 18000 με are achieved with large E/D and W/D ratios. The thinner lap joints have higher efficiencies (up to 36 %) and the dominant failure modes (net tension and shear out) were observed in both joint series for the same E/D and W/D ratios...|$|E
40|$|Straight {{break or}} {{transverse}} fissure {{is one of}} the most common failure modes associated with aluminothermic welds in Australian heavy haul railways. Straight break as a fatigue failure mainly nucleates from stress concentration sites at the weld collar edge and propagates in a near vertical direction under mode I crack opening. The reduction of fatigue performance influenced by the collar features and harsh operational conditions has been investigated using multi-axial fatigue analysis and validated on the basis of in-service failures. Practical observations suggest that a major contributor to the occurrence of many straight breaks is a specific defect known as finning or cold lap. Cold lap is a condition where excess weld material leaks out of the welding mould forming an unfused appendix on the rail surface. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks associated with the cold lap defect through numerical analysis and fracture mechanics. A thermostructural finite element model of a track portion incorporating an aluminothermic weld with a cold lap defect is developed and the cold lap is treated as a planar crack. Sensitivity analysis is performed on cold lap geometric parameters and some operational conditions. The results show that the probability of crack initiation from a cold lap defect largely depends on the <b>lap</b> <b>thickness,</b> lap tip location and the wheel-rail contact conditions. In particular, contact patch eccentricity and lateral tractive forces as a result of curving and hunting behaviour can increase the risk of crack nucleation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of process {{variations}} on unity gain frequency (ft) in 30 nm gate length FinFET by performing extensive TCAD simulations. Six different geometrical parameters, channel doping, source/drain doping and gate electrode work function are studied for their sensitivity on ft. It is found that ft is more sensitive to gate length, under <b>lap,</b> gate-oxide <b>thickness,</b> channel and Source/Drain doping and less sensitive to source/drain width and length, and work function variations. Statistical modelling has been performed for ft through design of experiment with respect to sensitive parameters. The model has been validated through a comparison between random set of experimental data simulations and predicted values obtained from the model. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the strengthening of}} concrete structures with externally bonded composite reinforcement, and focuses mainly {{on the influence of}} the FRP characteristics on the mechanical behavior of the composite to concrete interface. An experimental investigation was conducted, based on the characterization of such bonded assemblies and using a double lap joint shear test. Twelve different series of specimens were studied in order to evaluate the influence of various parameters related to the FRP material (i. e. the use of carbon or aramid and of fiber reinforced systems, the type of manufacturing process, the values of the Young modulus, the thickness of the FRP and the bonded length) as well as several parameters related to the adhesive joint (i. e. the <b>lap</b> joint <b>thickness,</b> the curing conditions and the elastic modulus of the epoxy adhesive). Analyses of the strain and shear stress distributions along the lap joints emphasized significant effects of the FRP properties and epoxy curing conditions on the interfacial strength. In addition, a bond strength model is proposed in {{the last part of the}} study...|$|R
40|$|Standard single lap, double lap and {{symmetric}} step lap {{bonded joints}} of Celion 3000 /PMR- 15 graphite/polyimide composite were evaluated. Composite to composite and composite to titanium joints were tested at 116 K (- 250 F), 294 K (70 F) and 561 K (550 F). Joint parameters evaluated are <b>lap</b> length, adherend <b>thickness,</b> adherend axial stiffness, lamina stacking sequence and adherend tapering. Advanced joint concepts were examined {{to establish the}} change in performance of preformed adherends, scalloped adherends and hybrid systems. The material properties of the high temperature adhesive, designated A 7 F, used for bonding were established. The bonded joint tests resulted in interlaminar shear or peel failures of the composite and {{there were very few}} adhesive failures. Average test results agree with expected performance trends for the various test parameters. Results of finite element analyses and of test/analysis correlations are also presented...|$|R

The ductile iron was utilized as lapping disc material, which can quickly thin the SiC wafer to the film of uniform <b>thickness.</b> After three-step <b>lapping</b> process, the <b>thickness</b> of the SiC wafer was reduced to 35 ± 4 μm.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the debonding strength of adhesive-bonded double-strap steel joints. A fracture-based criterion was formulated {{in terms of}} a stress singularity parameter, i. e., the stress intensity factor, which governs the magnitude of a singular stress field near the joint ends. No existing crack was assumed. A total of 24 steel joint specimens were tested under constant amplitude fatigue loadings at stress ratio of 0. 2 and frequency of 2 Hz. The joint stiffness ratio was slightly less than one to control the maximum adhesive stresses at the joint ends. To detect the debonding, a simple and practical technique was developed. The test results showed that the interfacial failure near the steel/adhesive corner was a dominant failure mode. The failure was brittle and the debonding life was governed by the crack initiation stage. The finite element analysis was employed to calculate the stress intensity factors and investigate the effects of the adhesive layer <b>thickness,</b> <b>lap</b> length and joint stiffness ratio on the debonding strength...|$|R
40|$|This article {{introduces}} {{an analytical}} procedure {{based on the}} well-known Shear Lag theory of Volkersen, but allowing {{to take into account}} a multilinear mechanical behaviour of the adhesive in order to determine an average shear stress profile along the bonded joint. The aim is to provide for a civil engineering application a simple design tool of bonded anchorages. Using this method, more consistent results are obtained concerning the anchorage length and a failure criteria can be expressed in terms of a maximum yielded length along the bonded joint. The validity of this criteria is assessed via an experimental investigation which includes material characterization as well as double lap joints quasi-static loading. The studied materials are a two-component commercial epoxy adhesive and glass fibre pultruded adherends. Different parameters of the joint are varied (surface preparation, adherend and bond <b>thickness,</b> <b>lap</b> length, geometrical configuration) so {{that it is possible to}} check qualitative expectations, and define a quantitative failure prediction parameter. In the last part, the shear stress profiles obtained using the described analytical procedure are compared to finite element results and good agreement is found between both approaches...|$|R
