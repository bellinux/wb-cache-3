40|$|Introduction Mucoceles are benign {{expansive}} cystic formations, {{composed of}} a mucus-secreting epithelium (respiratory or pseudostratified epithelium). Nasolacrimal mucocele occurs in {{a small proportion of}} children with nasolacrimal duct obstruction and is characterized by a cystic mass in the medial canthus with dilation of the nasolacrimal duct; although dacryocystoceles are rare in adults, they have been reported in patients with trachoma. Objective Discuss clinical aspects, diagnosis, and therapeutic management of mucocele of nasolacrimal duct based on literature review. Resumed Report The authors report a case of bilateral congenital nasolacrimal duct cysts in a 30 -year-old man, identified as a tumor in the topography of both <b>lacrimal</b> <b>sacs</b> since birth without associated symptoms. The patient underwent successive surgical treatments, leading to recurrence of the tumor at the right side and recurrent local infections. Conclusion Endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy has been increasingly used with good results and success rates similar to the external access...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE. Mucosa-associated {{lymphoid tissue}} (MALT) {{represents}} {{a part of}} the immune system located at mucosal surfaces. Its presence in the human eye is the point in question in the current study. Its occurrence, components, topography, and probable functional significance in the human conjunctiva and lacrimal drainage system were investigated. METHODS. Fifty-three complete conjunctival sacs were obtained from cadaveric eyes, prepared as flat wholemounts, stained, optically cleared, observed in total thickness, and sectioned for light microscopic histology, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. Eight <b>lacrimal</b> <b>sacs</b> and adhering canaliculi were prepared accordingly. RESULTS. Lymphoid tissue was mainly observed in the palpebral conjunctiva, more pronounced in the upper than in the lower lid. It occurred in different forms: 1) In all specimens, diffuse lymphoid tissue of lymphocytes and plasma cells, most of which were IgA positive, formed a thin layer in the lamina propria. The overlying epithelium produced secretory component. 2) In approximately three fifths of the conjunctival sacs, organized follicular accumulations were embedded in this layer. They had a lenticular shape, were composed of B lymphocytes, and were apically covered by lymphoepithelium. 3) Both types could be associated with the conjunctival crypts. Lymphoid tissu...|$|R

50|$|With {{the advent}} of nasal endoscopes, {{endoscopic}} dacryocystorhinostomy is becoming popular. In this procedure, a nasal endoscope is used to visualise the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>sac</b> through the nasal cavity. The bone covering the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>sac</b> is nibbled out. The medial wall of the sac is incised or excised, facilitating drainage of tears into the nasal cavity. This procedure avoids scarring.|$|E
40|$|A 40 -year-old man {{presented}} with right eye axial proptosis and ophthalmoplegia for 3 months. Imaging study showed a right intraconal mass with {{the erosion of}} the orbital floor. Incisional biopsy revealed mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Nasal endoscopy was normal and systemic tumor screening was negative for a primary source. The patient underwent right orbital exenteration, uncinectomy, nasal and maxillary mucosal biopsy. Malignant cells were found present in the mucosa of maxillary sinus roof and uncinate bone. The postoperative positron emission tomography scan showed residual active lesion in right orbital apex and maxilla but no primary lesion elsewhere. The patient subsequently underwent 35 cycles of postoperative radiotherapy. Primary mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the orbit is rare and typically arises from the <b>lacrimal</b> gland or <b>sac.</b> Those tumors not arising from lacrimal apparatus should be presumed metastatic in origin, and the thorough systemic survey should be undertaken in the search for the primary tumor...|$|R
