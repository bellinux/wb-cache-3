5000|$|Azzam and Bin <b>Laden</b> <b>set</b> up {{recruitment}} {{offices in}} the US, under the name [...] "Al-Khifah", the hub {{of which was the}} Farouq Mosque in Brooklyn's Atlantic Avenue. This was [...] "a place of pivotal importance for Operation Cyclone".|$|R
5000|$|Sometime in late 1988 {{or early}} 1989, Bin <b>Laden</b> <b>set</b> up al-Qaeda {{from the more}} extreme {{elements}} of the Services Office. However, {{it was not a}} large organization at the time; when Jamal al-Fadl (who had been recruited through the Brooklyn center in the mid-1980s) joined in 1989, he was described as Qaeda's [...] "third member".|$|R
25|$|Through al-Khadamat, bin Laden's fortune {{paid for}} air tickets and accommodation, dealt with {{paperwork}} with Pakistani authorities and provided other such {{services for the}} jihad fighters. To keep al-Khadamat running, bin <b>Laden</b> <b>set</b> up a network of couriers travelling between Afghanistan and Peshawar, which continued to remain active after 2001, according to Rahimullah Yusufzai, executive editor of The News International.|$|R
5000|$|The {{network that}} {{became known as}} al-Qaeda ("The Base") grew out of Arab volunteers who fought the Soviets and their puppet regimes in Afghanistan in the 1980s. In 1984 Abdullah Azzam and Osama bin <b>Laden</b> <b>set</b> up an {{organization}} known as the Office of Services in Peshawar, Pakistan, to coordinate and finance the [...] "Afghan Arabs", as the volunteers became known.|$|R
50|$|By 1984, with Azzam, bin Laden {{established}} a Saudi Arabian funded organization named Maktab al-Khadamat (MAK, Office of Order in English), which funneled money, arms and Muslim fighters {{from around the}} Arabic world into the Afghan war. Through al-Khadamat, bin Laden's inherited family fortune paid for air tickets and accommodation, dealt with paperwork with Pakistani authorities and provided other such services for the jihad fighters. In running al-Khadamat, bin <b>Laden</b> <b>set</b> up a network of couriers traveling between Afghanistan and Peshawar, which remained active after 2001, according to Rahimullah Yusufzai. It was during this time that Bin Laden met his future al-Qaeda collaborator, Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, a member and later head of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad.|$|R
50|$|After Osama bin Laden {{graduated}} from the university in Jeddah in 1981, he also lived {{for a time in}} Peshawar; Azzam convinced bin Laden to help personally finance the training of recruits. Some have suggested that Mohammed Atef was responsible for convincing Azzam to abandon his academic pursuits to devote himself solely to preaching jihad. Through al-Khadamat, bin Laden's fortune paid for air tickets and accommodation, dealt with paperwork with Pakistani authorities and provided other such services for the jihad fighters.

40|$|It is, by now, well {{accepted}} {{that those of}} us who live with/in contemporary Anglocentric popular culture are presented, from birth, with manifold icons and imaginings of the English countryside as idyllic. Indeed, the idea that, through such popular representations, we encounter and ‘consume’ this sense of ‘rural idyll’ – and a particular, underlying, ideologically <b>laden</b> <b>set</b> of idea(l) s – has been well rehearsed. However, this paper reflects upon a question which has hitherto been often overlooked: what is the (practical, tangible) nature of this ‘consumption’? Approaching this question, the paper re-presents a succession of encounters with one icon of idyllic rurality: Postman Pat. In so doing, the paper develops an understanding of some complex – and frequently banal, odd, happenstance, taken-for-granted – happenings and practices which are fundamentally part of the ‘consumption’ of ‘rural idyll’...|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in September 1999, the CTC {{picked up}} {{multiple}} signs that bin <b>Laden</b> had <b>set</b> in motion major terrorist attacks for {{the turn of}} the year. The CIA set in motion what Black later described as the [...] "largest collection and disruption activity in the history of mankind". They focused on known al-Qaeda terrorists, and on senior personnel both inside and outside Afghanistan.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in September 1999 the CTC {{picked up}} {{multiple}} signs that bin <b>Laden</b> had <b>set</b> in motion major terrorist attacks for {{the turn of}} the year. The CIA set in motion the [...] "largest collection and disruption activity in the history of mankind" [...] (as Cofer Black later put it). The CTC focused in particular on three groups of Qaeda personnel: those known to have been involved in terrorist attacks; and senior personnel both outside and inside Afghanistan—e.g. [...] "operational planner Abu Zubaydah" [...] and [...] "Bin Ladin deputy Muhammad Atef".|$|R
50|$|Two notable {{examples}} {{occur in}} Vetus Abit Littera, a four-voice Christmas conductus from the Florence manuscript, and Dic Christi, Veritas, a tirade against clerical hypocrisy written by Philip the Chancellor. The latter {{is found in}} the Carmina burana manuscript in a monophonic version and in the Paris sources in an elaborate three-voice <b>setting,</b> <b>laden</b> with caudae.|$|R
50|$|The new trains entered {{service in}} 2005 and 2006, {{gradually}} replacing {{most of the}} existing Class 80 units on the network (the main exception being services between Belfast and Larne, which were still provided by the Class 450 DMUs). The trains are capable of speeds of up to 145 km/h (90 mph), seat 201 (including 15 on tip-up seats) and have standing room for 280 passengers crush <b>laden.</b> The <b>sets</b> are numbered 3001-3023. All vehicles are powered. The individual cars are 3301 to 3323, 3501 to 3523 and 3401 to 3423. The end vehicles on each unit have cabs. 3001 is formed 3301-3501-3401 up to 3023 being formed 3323-3523-3423.|$|R
50|$|With {{virtually}} all of the Vic Reeves Big Night Out characters consigned to the past (only Greg Mitchell and the Stotts survived, the Stotts appearing in the second series), a whole range of new characters appeared. The show also featured pre-recorded sketches and a lavish studio <b>set,</b> <b>laden</b> with columns and pillars and in the centre the enormous letters R&M, from which the duo emerged at the start of each show.|$|R
60|$|There came a {{knock at}} the door, and the butler entered with a <b>laden</b> tea-tray and <b>set</b> it down upon a small Japanese table. There was a rattle of cups and saucers and the hissing of a fluted Georgian urn. Two globe-shaped china dishes were brought in by a page. Dorian Gray went over and poured out the tea. The two men sauntered languidly to the table, and {{examined}} what was under the covers.|$|R
50|$|A vehicle may be <b>laden</b> with explosives, <b>set</b> {{to explode}} by remote control or by a passenger/driver, {{commonly}} known as a car bomb or vehicle-borne IED (VBIED, pronounced vee-bid). On occasion {{the driver of the}} car bomb may have been coerced into delivery of the vehicle under duress, a situation known as a proxy bomb. Distinguishing features are low-riding vehicles with excessive weight, vehicles with only one passenger, and ones where the interior of the vehicles look as if they have been stripped down and built back up. Car bombs can carry thousands of pounds of explosives and may be augmented with shrapnel to increase fragmentation. The U.S. State Department has published a guide on car bomb awareness.|$|R
5000|$|Lyrically {{the album}} delves into a fantasy-laden story of Phil {{wandering}} through a dangerous landscape, {{being killed by}} an evil spirit known as [...] "The Big Black Death" [...] (played by Kyle Field of Little Wings), being eaten {{by a group of}} vultures (played by Karl Blau), and ascending into the cosmos after death. To fit the massive lyrical story the music ranges from jittering experimental rock to subtle layered folk music to huge natural reverb <b>laden</b> chorus sections <b>set</b> to slow drum rhythms. Though the album is compositionally reminiscent of previous Microphones records, Mount Eerie stands out amongst them as being the most conceptually driven and unrelentingly dark as the album progresses.|$|R
