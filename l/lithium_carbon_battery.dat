This electrochemical activity is localized at the cathode, while the electrolyte remains stable at the anode. Such a selective stability enables a novel bi-functional electrolyte design. 1 The additional capacity offered by the electrolyte results in an observed capacity beyond the theoretical maximum for conventional Li-CFx cells. Additionally, amorphous LiF is formed in a solid-state cell. This helps in the elimination of issues arising from solvents and crystalline LiF (volume expansion and heat generation) in conventional Li-CFx cells.

Cathodes were prepared at 30 wt% sulfur on different activated carbons having unloaded BET surface areas of 1200 to 3200 m 2 /g.

Additionally, cathodes prepared at 12. 5 wt%- 68 wt% on an activated carbon having unloaded BET surface area of 3200 m 2 /g showed excessive sulfur loading provided little additional capacity. Current battery technology relies on thin materials in order to limit the overpotential losses due to diffusion within the cell, which generally leads to increased cost and lower energy densities.

40|$|Ab initio {{molecular}} orbital calculations {{have been used}} to investigate the nature of lithium bonding in stage 1 <b>lithium</b> intercalated <b>carbon</b> anodes. This has been approximated by using layered carbon lattices such as coronene, (C{sub 24 }H{sub 12 }),anthracene, and anthracene substituted with boron. With two coronene carbon lattices forming a sandwich structure and intercalated with either 2, 3, 4 or 6 six lithiums, it has been found that the predominant mode of bonding for the lithium is at the carbon edge sites as opposed to bonding at interior carbon hexagon sites. Formation of all structures is thermodynamically allowed except for the two lithium case in which there is repulsion between the lattices. The optimized structure with six lithiums gives a reasonable approximation for the stage 1 <b>lithium</b> intercalated <b>carbon</b> anode. In this case the <b>lithium</b> to <b>carbon</b> ratio is 1 : 8 versus 1 : 6 occurring in the stage 1 graphite. The coronene lattices are eclipsed with a separation of 4. 03 {angstrom}. However, there is a slight ruffling of the lattice. Separation between adjacent lithiums is either 3. 32 {angstrom} or 2. 98 {angstrom}. Even though the separation between lithiums is very small, composition of the {{molecular orbital}}s suggests that there is no lithium cluster formation. The highest occupied molecular orbitals are composed of a combination of <b>lithium</b> and <b>carbon</b> orbitals. In contrast, in the C{sub 60 } fullerene lattice with three and five lithiums intercalated, there are molecular orbitals composed only of lithiums, indicative of cluster formation. For anthracene and boron substituted anthracene, lithium bonding takes place within the carbon hexagon sites. The separation between lithiums in a sandwich type structure with two anthracenes in the eclipsed conformation is 5. 36 {angstrom}. The effect of boron in a carbon lattice has been evaluated by comparing the difference in behavior of a single anthracene lattice reacting with a dilithium cluster as compared to a 1, 4, 5, 8 -tetraboroanthracene lattice. The effect of boron substitution is to increases lattice flexibility by allowing the lattice to twist and lithium to bond at adjacent hexagon sites.
