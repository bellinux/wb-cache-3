Most conodont zones and -Faunas recognized in Germany and Spain could be distinguished. The ages of the formations distinguished in the Compte-, Sierra Negra s. l. - and Renanué sub-facies of the Southern facies (Mey, 1968 a) could be indicated quite accurately. The formations in the various sub-facies are lithostratigraphically and chronostratigraphically correlated. There is very strong evidence of a Tournaisian hiatus of changing extent, while the existence of a small Lower Frasnian hiatus is probable and the existence of a Siegenian hiatus in the Compte subfacies might be suggested. <b>Lithostratigraphic</b> <b>correlation</b> of the formations of the Southern facies area with formations to the east, north and west, furnished stratigraphic cross sections, which were used for a reconstruction of the Pyrenean Basin. The picture arises of a basin in which during the Upper Givetian or lowermost Frasnian a central geanticline emerged, the Pyrenean Geanticline. Until the end of the Viséan the Pyrenean Geanticline remained an area of non-deposition. During the Namurian an intermontane basin possibly developed.

40|$|This study {{reviews the}} Quaternary {{alluvial}} stratigraphy in three semi-arid river basins of western India i. e., lower Luni (Rajasthan), and Mahi and Sabarmati (Gujarat alluvial plains). On {{the basis of}} OSL chronologies, it is shown that the existing intra-valley <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>correlations</b> require a revision. The sand, gravel and mud facies are present during various times in the three basins, however, the fluvial response to climate change, and the resulting facies associations, was dierent in the Thar desert as compared to that at the desert margin; this makes purely <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>correlations</b> unviable. It is further shown that the rivers in the Thar desert were more sensitive to climate change and had small response times and geomorphic thresholds {{as compared to the}} desert-margin rivers. This is illustrated during the early OIS 1, when the Luni river in the Thar desert was dynamic and showed frequent variations in fluvial styles such as gravel bedload braided streams, sand-bed ephemeral streams and meandering streams, all followed by incision during the early Holocene. The coeval deposits in Sabarmati, however, only show a meandering, floodplain-dominated river. Late Quaternary alluvial deposits in these basins unconformably overlie some older deposits that lack any absolute chronology. Based on the facies types and their associations, and the composition and architecture of the multistoried gravel sheets in the studied sections, it is suggested that older deposits are of pre-Quaternary age. This hypothesis implies the presence of a large hiatus incorporating much of the Quaternary period in the exposed sections. 1...|$|R

Alongslope bottom currents {{are thought to be}} the driving mechanism for large-scale sediment waves development. These currents are driven on their turn by an enhanced internal tide regime that could be attributed to the MOW introduction, which characterized the presence of a strong pycnal gradient. The integration of the seismic stratigraphy with the DSDP Site 548 downhole geophysical data allowed the proposition of a better chronostratigraphic and <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>correlation.</b> The early to late Pliocene sequence (from ~ 4. 2 to ~ 2. 7 Ma) shows no morphological evidence of bottom current driven sedimentation. However, from the late Pliocene (i. e. ~ 2. 7 Ma) to present, large-scale sediment waves have gradually developed in close association with palaeo-seafloor irregularities, inferring that sedimentation resumed with a marked large bottom current energy increase. The late Pliocene and the middle Pleistocene units contain mass wasting intervals.

Proper {{application of this}} data is dependent upon acquisition of accurate high-resolution chronostratigraphic data, best achieved through magnetostratigraphy. Collection of magnetostratigraphic and other proxy data from composite alluvial-fan sections assumes the chronostratigraphic significance of lithostratigraphy. We present the first test of this assumption with new magnetostratigraphy collected from Paleogene rocks of the southeastern Ebro basin. We report five new magnetostratigraphic sections that collectively sample 850 m of alluvial-fan and associated fluvial strata. One-hundred meters of lithostratigraphic overlap between these sections reveals equivalent magnetic polarities over short along-strike distances (∼ 200 – 2000 m). However, <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>correlation</b> of these sections with the magnetostratigraphy of continuously exposed strata eight km away reveals discrepancies in magnetic polarity trends and age interpretations. Correlation of our 760 m composite magnetostratigraphic section with the Paleogene geomagnetic polarity time scale suggests that this section spans from ca. 31. 3 to 27. 7 Ma (C 12 r–C 9 n; early to late Oligocene).

An unconformity that separates the Archaean and Mesoproterozoic sedimentary packages is near the Stillwell Hills. An eastward increase {{in the proportion of}} fragmentary detrital zircon in the younger package reflects proximity to late Mesoproterozoic volcanic sources. The Mesoproterozoic basin likely developed along an Andean-type margin to the Indo-Antarctic craton, possibly in a back-arc setting during the assembly of Rodinia. The widespread dissolution of zircon at c. 990 – 940 Ma during Rayner orogenesis in Kemp and MacRobertson lands largely precludes a traditional basin analysis via detrital geochronology, but the Hf isotopic ratio of metamorphic zircon precipitated following anatexis provides a homogenised signature, equivalent to a bulk-rock model age, which {{can be used as a}} stratigraphic proxy.

Cross sections, <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>correlations,</b> and interpretationof seismic profiles through the basins show evidence for: (i) a Triassic until Jurassic-Early Cretaceousrifting phase that induced lateral variations of facies and strata thicknesses; (ii) a set of faults orientedNE-SW, NW-SE, N-S, and E-W that guided sediment accumulation in pull-apart basins, which were subjectto compressive and transpressive deformation during Eocene (Lutetian-Priabonian), Miocene (Tortonian), andPliocene-Quaternary; and (iii) NNW-SSE to NS contractional events that occurred during the Late Pliocene.

The lower varve series was deposited proximal to the retreating ice margin and consists of varves that grade upward from gray to red. The upper varve series was deposited after the drainage event when fresh water within the Baltic basin flowed westward north of Billingen; the upper varves grade from red to gray. Grain size, elemental composition (determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF)), iron and organic-carbon content vary within each varve, with values that grade upward through each varve, but with a sharp contact with the overlying varve. The two varve units differ from each other, with the lower sequence being coarser and the upper containing a higher iron and organic-carbon content. We attribute the differences between pre- and post-drainage varves to reflect changes in distance to the ice margin and provenance.

To provide a more precise chronological framework, we present two magnetostratigraphies of Campanian strata from the Rabot Formation that crops out at Hamilton Norte (200 m thick) and Redonda Point (340 m thick) in James Ross Island. Sampled sections consist of poorly-consolidated, drab-colored fine sandstones and mudstones. Bulk susceptibility logs of both sections show a similar pattern of relatively low values at the lower and upper levels with significantly higher values at mid-levels that confirms the <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>correlation</b> between sections. Rock magnetic studies suggest that this change is not attributable to a ferrimagnetic fraction but to a paramagnetic contribution of presumed detrital origin. Stepwise thermal demagnetization showed dominant unblocking temperatures higher than 400 °C. Progressive hybrid low-temperature cycling, low-field AF and thermal demagnetization in a controlled N_ 2 atmosphere, reveals a two-polarity characteristic component of possible primary origin. Rock magnetic experiments suggest that detrital titano-magnetite {{is the most likely}} remanence carrier. Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility results show sedimentary fabrics, indicating that beds were not significantly buried or compacted.

The assemblages are dominated by smectite and illite, with minor amounts of chlorite and kaolinite. The highest smectite amounts and best smectite crystallinities occur in the upper Eocene part of CIROS- 1, below 425 - 445 mbsf. They indicate that during their deposition, chemical weathering conditions prevailed on the nearby continent. Large parts of East Antarctica were probably ice-free at that time, but some glaciers reached the sea {{and contributed to the}} glaciomarine sedimentation. In contrast, only minor total amounts of smectite are present in Oligocene and younger sediments due to the shift to mainly physical weathering on an ice-covered Antarctic continent. However, relative smectite percentages rise to more than 60 % during two late Oligocene intervals (ca. 27. 5 - 26. 2 and 25. 0 - 24. 5 Ma) and during one early Miocene interval starting at ca. 23. 3 Ma. These intervals are characterized by ice masses coming probably from the south, where volcanic rocks acted as a source, as also indicated by the composition of the sand and gravel fractions. During the other intervals, the ice came from the west, where the physical erosion of basement rocks and sedimentary rocks of the Beacon Supergroup in the Transantarctic Mountains provided high illite concentrations. Because the two drill sites are only 4 km apart, their clay mineral records can be correlated.

This is particularly useful for reconstructing composite, stratigraphically continuous sequences for individual ODP sites by splicing the uninterrupted records obtained from subsections of offset cores recovered from adjacent holes. Correlation between the WCMS profiles of holes drilled at different sites {{is also possible}} in some instances, especially when lithologic variations at each site are controlled by regional paleoceanographic or global (i. e., orbitally forced) paleoclimatic changes. In such circumstances, WCMS may {{also be used as}} a proxy paleoclimatic indicator, duly assisting climatostratigraphic zonation of the recovered sequence by more conventional microfossil and isotopic techniques. High-resolution WCMS profiles are also useful in detecting intervals of the recovered sequence affected by drilling disturbance, in the form of contamination by pipe rust or similar metallic artifacts as well as discontinuities related to repenetration of the corer or loss of material between successively cored intervals. Stratigraphic intervals that have been affected by early (suboxic) diagenesis resulting from a high initial organic matter content of the sediment are also readily identified by WCMS logging. The MS signal of horizons affected by suboxic diagensis is typically degraded in proportion to the duration and intensity (related to initial Corg concentration) of organic matter remineralization. The lowering of MS values during suboxic diagenesis results from "dissolution" (bacterially mediated ionic dissociation) of magnetic iron and manganese oxides and oxyhydroxides in the sediment. It is to be hoped that, on future ODP (or similar) cruises, WCMS logging will cease to be regarded as a mere adjunct to paleomagnetic measurements, but rather as a simple, yet powerful, lithostratigraphic tool, directly analogous to downhole geophysical logging tools, and complimentary to shipboard techniques for whole-core {{measurements of}} physical properties (e. g., P-wave logging, GRAPE, etc.) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{elemental}} chemostratigraphy of the Upper Cretaceous Niobrara Member of the Mancos Shale {{shows that}} six chemostratigraphic zones {{can be identified}} in the Piceance Basin, Colorado, based on geochemical data collected from cuttings at 10 -, 20 -, and 30 -ft (3. 05, 6. 10, and 9. 14 m) intervals. Chemostratigraphic correlations of nine wells spaced 20 mi (~ 32 km) apart closely match <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>correlations</b> made using gamma-ray and deep-resistivity logs. Lithologic interpretations made from wireline logs indicate that the Niobrara Member and equivalent strata consist primarily of interbedded calcareous shale and shaley limestone facies that increase in thickness to the northwest of the basin. The geochemical data suggest that during deposition of the Niobrara Member, anoxia and calcium enrichment increased {{to the east of}} the basin, whereas terrestrial input and clay enrichment increased to the northwest. Element cross-plots suggest that {{a large portion of the}} silicon is detrital and that the Niobrara Member becomes an increasingly more clastic than carbonate system to the west. The Δ Log R-derived total organic carbon (TOC) calculated using a sonic-resistivity overlay analysis technique shows that the Niobrara Member comprises organic-rich and organic-poor deposits. Average TOC values range between 1 (in organic-poor deposits) and 2. 37 wt. % (in organic-rich deposits) with higher TOC values recorded in the southern and eastern portions of the basin. Relative-rock brittleness estimates from element and TOC data show the stratigraphic variability of alternating ductile (TOC rich, Ca and Si/Al poor) and brittle intervals (TOC poor, Ca and Si/Al rich) for the Niobrara Member...|$|R
40|$|The Upper Ordovician {{units in}} Southwestern Ontario record the distal {{response}} {{to the development of}} the Taconic Appalachian foreland basin. The proximal representation in Ohio and Pennsylvania, contain the Utica/Point Pleasant Play (!). The relationship between the proximal and distal portions of the Taconic Appalachian foreland basin is not clearly defined due to limited chronostratigraphic data and only <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>correlations</b> in southwestern Ontario. The first step in evaluating the relationship between the Upper Ordovician succession in Ontario and that in the United States is to develop a high frequency allostratigraphic framework that can be integrated and compared to the frameworks in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The application of allostratigraphic principals allowed for four developments: 1. The subdivision of the Upper Ordovician units in southwestern Ontario into four alloformations, and further dividing the Blue Mountain Formation into a high resolution allostratigraphic hierarchy consisting of two alloformations and nine allomembers. 2. The development of twenty cross-sections in southwestern Ontario using digital well logs and core to correlate the allostratigraphic units, 3. The creation of subsurface elevation and isopach maps, defining structure and extent of the allomembers in subsurface, 4. Identifying the Algonquin Arch as a mobile feature during the Upper Ordovician, responding to the loading and unloading of the Taconic orogenic front and the resulting clastic wedge in the Appalachian Basin. These four developments create a platform for future work towards evaluating the temporal relationship between, and defining the vertical and lateral extents of, a Utica-equivalent petroleum system and associated plays in southwestern Ontario in the Appalachian Basin...|$|R
40|$|The {{southwest}} {{margin of}} the Central Anatolian Plateau has experienced multiple phases of topographic growth, including the formation of localized highs prior to the Late Miocene that were later affected by wholesale uplift of the plateau margin. Our new biostratigraphic data limit the age of uplifted marine sediments at the southwest plateau margin at 1. 5 km elevation to < 7. 17 Ma, and regional <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>correlations</b> imply that the age is < 6. 7 Ma. Single-grain CA-TIMS U-Pb zircon analyses from a reworked ash within the marine sediments yield dates as young as 10. 6 Ma, indicating a maximum age {{that is consistent with}} the biostratigraphy. Our structural measurements within the uplifted region and fault inversion modeling agree with previous findings in surrounding regions, with early contraction followed by strike-slip and extensional deformation during uplift. Focal mechanisms from shallow earthquakes show that the extensional phase has continued to the present. Broad similarities in the change in the tectonic stress regime (after 8 Ma) and the onset of surface uplift (after 7 Ma) imply that deep-seated process(es) caused post- 7 Ma uplift. The geometry of lithospheric slabs beneath the plateau margin, Pliocene to recent alkaline volcanism, and the uplift pattern with accompanying normal faulting point toward slab tearing and localized heating {{at the base of the}} lithosphere as a probable mechanism for post- 7 Ma uplift of the southwest margin. Considering previous work in the region, there appears to be an important link between slab dynamics and surface uplift throughout the Anatolian Plateau’s southern margin...|$|R
40|$|Manganese-rich garnet-quartz {{rocks and}} gneisses {{occur in the}} Varied Group of the Moldanubian Zone, Bohemian Massif, in close {{association}} with amphibolites, marbles and accompanying graphite gneisses. Fine-grained garnets contain (mol. %) 26 - 37 spessartine, 36. 8 - 45. 9 almandine, 11. 1 - 14. 3 pyrope, 2. 9 - 21. 0 grossular. Minor amphibole present in some samples is ferrimagnesiohornblende with 0. 17 - 0. 22 Mn pfu. Accessory ilmenite contains 24 - 34 mol. % pyrophanite and 1. 7 - 5. 8 hematite. Some closely associated impure calcite marbles (or amphibolites) carry Ti-bearing andradite, epidote, diopside-hedenbergite, and accessory magnetite. Data from the Varied Group indicate that manganese enrichment took place both under oxidizing and reducing conditions, but the Mn-garnet-quartz rocks are oxidic. Normalization of major-element contents in the Mn-rich rocks by average abundances in Varied Group paragneisses shows ten- to hundred-fold enrichment in MnO and a slight to moderate increase in CaO and P 2 O 5 . Values for Na 2 O and K 2 O indicate severe depletion in some samples, but contents of other oxides are close to unity. Comparison of chondrite-normalized REE patterns in Mn-rich rocks with data for ordinary paragneisses (Varied Group) also indicates that detrital component in Mn-rich rocks was closely comparable to material supplied for protolith of paragneisses. This permits to ascribe the spike of Mn to likely short-lived exhalative processes. Manganese-rich garnet-quartz rocks and gneisses remained unnoticed till now mainly owing to a small thickness of their layers, typically less than 1 m. Structural relations in regions carrying Mn-rich rocks indicate their occurrence in relict domains of preserved D 1 structures with NW-SE trending foliation. It is suggested that in regionally prevalent areas dominated by superimposed refoliation (D 2 , D 3 ) the thin layers of Mn-rich rocks were likely reduced to boudins dispersed in paragneiss matrix. Comparison with published data for similar Mn-rich rocks abroad (including the so-called coticules) strongly indicates a <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>correlation</b> potential of Mn-rich garnet-quartz rocks...|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{geological}} mapping and improved {{understanding of the}} geological evolution of the siliciclastic late Ediacaran rocks of the Mistaken Point Ecological Reserve (MPER) and the Catalina Dome, both of Newfoundland, provide a new framework for improved lithostratigraphic subdivision of the successions. The <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>correlation</b> of the Catalina Dome with the succession at MPER {{is found to be}} incorrect, prompting the erection of the Trinity Bay North Group to classify the rocks of the Catalina Dome. U-Pb (zircon) ages from the successions provide essential temporal constraints on {{the rise and fall of}} the Ediacara biota, and show that the Catalina Dome sections are up to 5 Myr older than previously thought. Both the MPER and Catalina Dome successions show an early fossil assemblage characterised by the presence of Trepassia and Vinlandia; a taxonomic radiation ∼ 575 Ma; the emergence of evidence for animals ∼ 565 Ma; and the sudden disappearance of most forms within post- 565 Ma slumped slope deposits. These points provide the basis of discussion around the potential for a biostratigraphy for the Ediacaran of Avalonia, and support the 'Ediacaran Explosion' hypothesis. Previous research using sedimentary strucutres and geochemical proxies to assign a nonmarine deposition environment to the MPER and Catalina Dome sections is found to be flawed and without merit. There is no evidence for shallow marine or sub-aerial depositional environments. All known Avalonian rangeomorphs are found in deep-marine facies. The environmental controls on the stratigraphic distribution of taxa remain poorly constrained. Analysis of tuffites within MPER suggests they were deposited by ashy turbidity currents, rather than as ash-falls. This prompts caution when using these tuffites for geochronological analysis, and requires the re-evaluation of the traditional taphonomic model for rangeomorph fossilisation. 'Post-fossilisation processes' are shown to bias fossil census studies, most notably through differing mechanisms of tuffite weathering and erosion. The impacts on palaeoecological studies, and geoconservation efforts are considered. The geoconservation legislative frameworks for Newfoundland and England are compared and contrasted, and recommendations made. </p...|$|E
40|$|Elemental (carbon, sulphur and {{biogenic}} opal) {{analysis was}} performed on the bulk sediments recovered from four core sites (MAR 00 - 5, MAR 00 - 6, and MAR 00 - 8) in the Black Sea and core site MAR 98 - 11 in the Marmara Sea. Isotopic (δ¹³C and δ ³⁴S) analysis was also performed on the bulk organic matter in the sediments. Linear extrapolations based on ¹⁴C dates in the three Black Sea cores indicate that while MAR 00 - 6 is characterized by continuous and uniform sediment deposition, cores MAR 00 - 5 and MAR 00 - 8 lack a record of the last ∼ 5000 years. δ¹³C values from ∼- 26 ‰ to ∼- 23 ‰ for the TOC in the Black Sea cores indicate the mixing of isotopically light land-derived material with isotopically heavier autochthonous carbon derived from primary marine production. Interpretations from proxy data extracted from the cores suggest that relatively higher TOC contents in core MAR 00 - 6 compared to the other Black Sea cores can be explained by better preservation of organic matter. This is attributed to the existence of a more stable stratified water-column well below wave base and/or greater salinity contrast between surface and bottom waters at this site before 5000 yr BP. [...] <b>Lithostratigraphic</b> <b>correlation</b> to nearby core MAR 98 - 12 with its ¹⁴C dates places sapropel deposition in core MAR 98 - 11 between ∼ 9800 to ∼ 6600 yr BP, which coincides with the contemporaneous sapropel S 1 in the Aegean Sea. δ¹³C values, the relatively high terrestrial organic-carbon component and other proxy data during this period point to a predominantly terrestrial source for the organic matter and reduced oxygen levels in the bottom waters. These data from core MAR 98 - 11 broadly support the view of Aksu and coworkers {{that there has been a}} sustained brackish outflow from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea via the intervening Marmara Sea since ∼ 11000 - 10500 yr BP...|$|E
40|$|Silurian {{and lower}} Devonian {{sedimentary}} successions are uncommon within {{the remnants of}} Gondwana. The Port Stephens Formation, the basal unit of the middle Palaeozoic West Falkland Group, presents {{a rare opportunity to}} study Gondwanan material of Siluro-Devonian age. The formation on West Falkland is c. 2560 m thick and consists of five members: Plantation, Albemarle, Mount Alice, South Harbour and Fish Creek. Thirty-five lithofacies are defined using variations in grain size and bedding characteristics. The distribution of these lithofacies and their associated ichnofacies between the various members lead us to suggest terrestrial and shallow marine deposition on an extensive, gently shelving alluvial to coastal plain. Vertical facies trends through the Port Stephens Formation, and into the base of the overlying Fox Bay Formation, record a complex superposition of subenvironments within a distinct overall transgressive–regressive–transgressive pattern, with the bulk of sediment accumulating during the regressive phase. Palaeocurrents indicate a basin to the present-day NE throughout. These results, together with <b>lithostratigraphic</b> <b>correlations</b> between the Port Stephens Formation and the Nardouw Subgroup in South Africa, are consistent with a reconstructed position off eastern South Africa and on the palaeo-Pacific margin of Gondwana, requiring a near- 180 ° rotation of the Falkland Island microplate during break-up, in agreement with previous models. We suggest that global changes in sea level during the mid–late Silurian and early Devonian strongly influenced changes in the depositional environment. Enhanced erosion of the continental margin and extensive sediment bypass during the regressive phase of this cycle could help to explain the low abundance of preserved Gondwanan material of this age. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} measured {{section and}} sequence stratigraphic {{interpretation of the}} Pennsylvanian (Moscovian) Hermosa Formation on Sandstone Mountain near Rico Colorado, reveals 19 unconformity-bounded sequences, nested within 3 - 5 sequence sets. Measuring 286 m thick, the section provides the closest surface location to examine the updip facies equivalent to the prodeltaic shales that host recent shale gas plays in the adjacent basin. Here we present a new sequence stratigraphic interpretation of a section measured in the medial to upper portions of the Hermosa Group as defined by Spencer and Cross, 1900. This section appears to correlate with the upper sequences of the Hermosa Cliffs trend 14 miles to the East described by Gianniny, Miskell-Gerhardt, and Ritter (2008). The Pennsylvanian strata in Rico consists of marine mixed carbonate-siliciclastics lithologies and non-marine clastics. The siliclastics are interpreted {{to be dominated by}} proximal fluvial and deltaic facies with a notably lower feldspar content than those of the Hermosa Cliffs sections. Marine facies range from prodeltaic black shales, to shallow marine, photic zone carbonates with a diverse open marine fauna. <b>Lithostratigraphic</b> <b>correlations</b> suggest that the base of this section is above the upper Akah interval evaporites and may range into the upper Pennsylvanian below the Permian marine Rico Formation. Subaerial exposure and subsequent scour of the tops of the carbonate beds delineate the position of sequence boundaries, while flooding surfaces in both carbonate and clastic lithologies define higher frequency stratigraphic cyclicity. The high frequency cyclicity of this section is attributed to glacial eustasy in addition to the variations in sediment supply due to climate and uplift/subsidence on this tectonically active basin margin...|$|R
40|$|Nd and Sr isotope {{systematics}} {{may provide}} important {{constraints on the}} location of major thrust systems that separate lithologically similar sedimentary sequences. The potential of the technique is illustrated by this isotopic study of the Main Central thrust system of the Himalaya. Nd isotope data from the Garhwal Himalaya indicate that metasedimentary rocks from the Vaikrita Group (Nd = – 14 to – 19) correlate closely with those from the High Himalayan Crystalline Series, which constitutes the hanging-wall lithologies of the Main Central thrust. In contrast, metasedimentary rocks from the Munsiari Group (Nd = – 23 to – 28) show marked similarities to the Lesser Himalayan Series in the footwall of the Main Central thrust. Sr isotopes support the correlations in that the Vaikrita Group shows partial reequilibration at 500 Ma, whereas the Munsiari Group has not undergone Sr isotope homogenization since 1800 Ma. Thus, the Vaikrita thrust that juxtaposes these two formations is recognized as the Main Central thrust in Garhwal Himalaya. The thrust coincides, approximately, with {{the location of the}} kyanite isograd, confirming that inverted metamorphism is characteristic of both hanging wall and footwall of the Main Central thrust. Along the Tons thrust (known locally as the Srinagar thrust) 50 km south of the Main Central thrust, low-grade quartzarenites with Nd-Sr isotope and trace element characteristics typical of Lesser Himalayan formations have been emplaced on phyllites and siltstones with geochemical characteristics of the High Himalayan Crystalline Series. The field relationships most probably result from out-of-sequence thrusting in which Lesser Himalayan Series rocks to the north were emplaced over low-grade equivalents of the High Himalayan Crystalline Series preserved in the external part of the orogen.
