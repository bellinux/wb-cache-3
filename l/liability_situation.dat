Eightysix Swedish MNC managers were interviewed in Sweden during the Summer of 1988 concerning legal liability in America. Their views are unanimously negative.

40|$|In recent years, {{more people}} have been {{claiming}} financial recompense for personal injuries they sustain. Increasingly, the targets of such claims are highway authorities, transport operators and property owners. This paper outlines an area of risk commonly overlooked by practitioners, but which can be managed effectively and can afford both cost savings and public safety improvements. Inconsistencies between design standards, safety improvement policies and maintenance regimes for the more common vehicle-based infrastructure can all weaken an authority's position when assessing their prior knowledge of potentially hazardous environments. This has direct implications on the likely success of defending public liability claims. With the evolution of intelligent transport systems and more sustainable modes of transport, the <b>liability</b> <b>situation</b> is changing. Tram tracks, cycle routes and even the existence of busy pedestrian routes beside low priority traffic routes, are all testing the robustness of highway authority policies and practices. This paper outlines how the highway factor may be found to be contributory {{in the event of}} an accident. The highway authority's and transport operator's duties and powers are then considered, along with examples showing how exposure to personal injury claims can arise. The concept of “prior knowledge” (emanating from a vast array of sources) is introduced, before the importance of internal communication and the management and use of information is considered...|$|E

This Article argues that {{in the face of}} this attack, advocates and scholars have given insufficient attention to a potent strategy—holding corporate officers liable. It examines the corporate officer liability question through the lens of tort liability, focusing on those officers with superior responsibility over their subordinates who physically commit the violations. It is the first to provide a systematic analysis of how superior officer liability under tort and international law approaches to superior responsibility and criminal liability might provide a basis for greater accountability for corporate officers. This Article examines the historical origins of military and state civilian command responsibility, the trials of civilian corporate officials in Nuremberg and Tokyo jurisprudence following World War II, the special international and hybrid criminal tribunals first established in the 1990 s, and tort cases in the U. S. and other jurisdictions. In so doing, this Article complements important parallel efforts to hold corporations liable. This Article considers options for officer <b>liability</b> in <b>situations</b> when governments cannot or will not bring criminal charges, or when bringing claims against the officer may be the most efficient means of changing corporate behavior. It concludes that human rights law, international criminal law, and domestic tort and related liability standards all provide liability for corporate officers under a theory of superior responsibility for human rights violations. This common core standard provides an important tool for compensating victims of past abuses and deterring ongoing or future human rights violations...|$|R

High-N individuals were proposed to be characterized by increased noise within information processing from perception to action. To further examine this relationship, we collected self-report data from 222 individuals, measuring N via the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire and the related construct of Behavioural Inhibition System sensitivity via the BIS/BAS scales, and assessing cognitive failure liability via the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ). The results revealed positive correlations between N and general cognitive failure liability, providing further support for the mental noise hypothesis. A more detailed investigation of CFQ subscales (Meiran et al., 1994) yielded a specific pattern, with the strongest correlation between N and the CFQ–Unintended Activation subscale (r =. 40; p <. 01).

Yet, despite a November, 2001 joint initiative undertaken by the EEOC, the Justice Department, and the Labor Department to increase sensitivity to and combat instances of potential discrimination or harassment against individuals who are—or are perceived to be—Muslim, Arab, Afghani, Middle Eastern, or South Asian, EEOC charge statistics for workplace discrimination claims involving religion, ethnicity, national origin, and citizenship indicate that the reported incidence of such conduct has continued to increase. This paper examines recent federal court cases that involve employment discrimination claims by Arab- and Muslim-Americans at both the trial court and appellate court levels to identify problematic fact patterns that may give rise to employer liability and to better understand judicial treatment of the legal issues when such cases are taken up on appeal. Management guidance for reducing potential <b>liability</b> when such <b>situations</b> arise in the workplace is developed based on recent findings in the case law.

National laws tend to vary considerably regarding the scope and extent of secondary liability, with U. S. tending to be more liberal with the imposition of such liability than most of its major trading partners. This lack of uniformity in secondary liability rules in the international arena makes the evaluation of infringement liability in that setting uncertain and makes it difficult for business to effectively plan international intellectual property strategies. Given the global nature of modern business activity, {{the time has come to}} open serious dialogue on the advisability of creating uniform international standards for secondary liability for infringement of intellectual property rights. Unfortunately, instead of focusing on the full panoply of situations in which secondary liability for intellectual property can occur, and the range of considerations that might affect imposition of such liability, such as notions of respondeat superior, intent, authorization, and control, the current debate has settled on the imposition of secondary liability in the peer-to-peer file-swapping arena. This narrow focus may well make it more difficult, if not impossible, to reach consensus on this important issue. By stepping back and reframing the issue in more general terms of secondary liability outside the digital environment, we can more easily contemplate important questions such as the pros and cons of imposing such <b>liability,</b> the <b>situations</b> in which such liability makes sense, and the manner in which we balance the rights of the public and goals of free trade and markets against the need to encourage innovation by protecting the rights of the innovators...|$|R
40|$|Periodically {{the public}} reads {{of the injury}} of a citizen other than a state {{employee}} {{at the hands of}} a former mental patient who either escaped because of inadequate guarding or was released from a state or federal institution because of an improper release-diagnosis. The public assumes that the injured party will be reimbursed, but who will bear the burden of reimbursement? Confinement often leaves the patient judgment proof; the employee whose negligence allowed the escape is frequently judgment proof; the employee who negligently certified the release of an unrehabilitated patient is clothed with immunity from suit on his release-discretion; and in a vast majority of jurisdictions the courts are closed to tort actions against the sovereign. Realizing the inequities of the above situation, Nebraska has provided for a legislative tort claims board. In addition, bills to establish state <b>liability</b> in <b>situations</b> where the doctrine of respondeat superior would make a private employer liable for the torts of his employees have been introduced into the last two sessions of the Nebraska legislature.

To explore this possibility, Fig. 7 also shows the net pensions savings generated by the reform (expressed as an annuity and averaged by age). The overall value obtained in the entire sample is 1, 500 euros, well above the 0.9 needed to offset the welfare losses. The graphs display where this difference is obtained. For the unemployed whose actions are unchanged, the pension savings and welfare losses are almost identical. Appreciable differences appear only once behavior has been modified. When the reform leads to shifts from searching into retirement, the result is negative (net pension <b>liabilities</b> increase). These <b>situations</b> are, however, a very small proportion of the total (less than 1 %). In all other cases, the savings are substantially higher than the compensations (especially when the change in behavior is from non-participation to search). Overall, the simulated financial savings achieved by the reform more than compensate for the welfare losses generated. We can conclude that, if the labor market conditions remain unaltered after the reform, the simulated experiment leads to a net welfare improvement.|$|R
