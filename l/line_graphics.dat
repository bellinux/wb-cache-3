The recently released GameCube was performing poorly compared to competitors, with Sony's PlayStation 2 and Microsoft's Xbox outselling it. His presidency also came {{at the onset of the}} popularization of online gaming, and Nintendo had yet to move into this facet of the market. He took a cautious approach to the issue, stating: [...] "We're not negative toward the idea of going online. We're just practical." [...] He also fostered a relationship between Nintendo and Capcom that improved the GameCube's appeal. During an interview in 2002, Iwata stated that he felt the gaming industry was becoming too exclusive, and he wanted to develop hardware and games that would appeal to all players rather than focusing on top of the <b>line</b> <b>graphics.</b>|$|E
500|$|Influenced by his {{honeymoon in}} the Caribbean, Jarrell became {{interested}} in the effects of man-made and natural sunlight on the environment. Experimentation with pigments, media, imagery and design allowed him to create artworks that fully expressed his intended messages. Referring to works such as Nassau (1968) and Sign of the Times (1966), Jarrell commented: [...] "The colors of the Bahamas influenced my use of color and my approach to my work." [...] With Sign of the Times he shows a street scene, his first attempt at a painting involving social interaction. In 1968, Jarrell became art director at Sander <b>Line</b> <b>Graphics,</b> only to quit shortly thereafter to become self-employed. Aside from creating his art he also started a successful mail-order photo processing business. Soon after Jarrell and Jae decided to open a gallery space below their studio: WJ Studio and Gallery. While the studio and gallery flourished, Jarrell taught part-time art classes at Wadsworth Elementary School and considered moving to New York, seeking refuge {{in the heart of the}} art world.|$|E

5000|$|A {{general-purpose}} language, Logo {{is widely}} {{known for its}} use of turtle graphics, in which commands for movement and drawing produced <b>line</b> <b>graphics</b> either on screen or with a small robot called a turtle. The language was conceived to teach concepts of programming related to Lisp and only later to enable what Papert called [...] "body-syntonic reasoning", where students could understand, predict and reason about the turtle's motion by imagining {{what they would do}} if they were the turtle. There are substantial differences among the many dialects of Logo, and the situation is confused by the regular appearance of turtle-graphics programs that call themselves Logo.|$|E
5000|$|Logo's most-known {{feature is}} the turtle (derived {{originally}} from a robot of the same name), an on-screen [...] "cursor" [...] that showed output from commands for movement and small retractable pen, together producing <b>line</b> <b>graphics.</b> It has traditionally been displayed either as a triangle or a turtle icon (though it can be represented by any icon). Turtle graphics {{were added to the}} Logo language by Seymour Papert in the late 1960s to support Papert's version of the turtle robot, a simple robot controlled from the user's workstation that is designed to carry out the drawing functions assigned to it using a small retractable pen set into or attached to the robot's body.|$|E

50|$|There are modes with a {{character}} box width of 9-dots (e.g. the default 80×25 mode), however the 9th column {{is used for}} spacing between characters, so the content cannot be changed. It is always blank, and drawn with the current background colour. An exception to this is in <b>Line</b> <b>Graphics</b> Enable mode, which causes code points 0xC0 to 0xDF inclusive to have the 8th column repeated as the 9th. These code points cover those box drawing characters which must extend {{all the way to}} the right side of the glyph box. For this reason, placing letter-like characters in code points 0xC0-0xDF should be avoided. The box drawing characters from 0xB0 to 0xBF are not extended as they do not point to the right and so do not require extending.|$|E
