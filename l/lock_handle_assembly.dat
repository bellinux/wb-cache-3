40|$|Fractographic {{analysis}} indicated that the canopy <b>locking</b> <b>handle</b> had failed by fatigue.

A fatigue crack was found to have initiated and propagated to a critical length in one of the eye-ends. When the pilot operated this handle for unlocking the canopy, this particular eye-end had fractured first leading to overload failure of the other eye-end. In general, the quality of casting was found poor. A detailed analysis with recommendations is presented in this report...|$|R

25|$|Locking pliers, Mole grips or Vise-Grips are pliers {{that can}} be locked into position, using an {{over-center}} action. One side of the handle includes a bolt {{that is used to}} adjust the spacing of the jaws, {{the other side of the}} handle, especially in larger models, often includes a lever to push the two sides of the handles apart to unlock the pliers. William Petersen of DeWitt, Nebraska, invented and patented a primitive version of a wrench in 1921. However, it wasn't until 1924 that the first locking pliers with a <b>locking</b> <b>handle</b> that Petersen called the Vise-Grip was patented.|$|R

50|$|Management {{believed}} that his proposed changes would be costly to implement, {{and there was}} some debate about who would end up paying for them, Convair or McDonnell Douglas. Applegate's suggestions to upgrade the door, and especially the cabin floor, would have required the aircraft to be grounded, an expensive proposition. Instead, a set of minor changes were made, intended to ensure that the latches were properly seated and the <b>locking</b> <b>handle</b> could not be operated if they weren't. These changes were limited to strengthening some of the locking system's parts, and adding a small window to allow handlers to visually inspect the latches. However, baggage handlers were not informed of the window's purpose.|$|R
50|$|Two metal cams, one {{stationary}} and one movable, {{are used}} to immobilize the rope. The position of the movable cam {{is controlled by the}} <b>locking</b> <b>handle.</b> When the handle is raised, the movable cam is pressed towards the stationary cam so as to grip the rope by compressing it between the cams. Conversely, the lock is released by lowering the handle, thus retracting the movable cam away from the stationary cam and releasing the grip on the rope. The position of the stationary cam can usually be adjusted with a socket head adjustment screw. This enables the spacing between the cams to be adjusted so that, when locked, the rope lock can accommodate ropes of different diameters.|$|R
