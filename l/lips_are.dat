5|$|In the song's music video, Trainor sings into a red {{microphone}} {{in front of}} a pastel blue wall. She is sometimes flanked by backup dancers and television screens. <b>Lips</b> <b>are</b> used as a motif throughout the video; they appear as closeups of Trainor's mouth and as a large drawing of lips used as a backdrop. Yahoo! Music writer Lyndsey Parker compared the video to the poster for The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Trainor wears lip-shaped earrings and sunglasses in the video, and is seen reclining on a lip-shaped sofa. Parker compared the sofa in the video to the sofas used in the American television program So You Think You Can Dance. The video's set changes constantly; props are lifted on-and-off screen by workers throughout the clip.|$|E
5|$|The {{kitefin shark}} has a {{moderately}} elongated {{body with a}} very short, rounded snout. The eyes and spiracles are large. The <b>lips</b> <b>are</b> thick with pleats or fringes, though are not modified to be suctorial. There are 1621 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 1720 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The upper teeth are small and spike-shaped, curving slightly towards {{the corners of the}} mouth. The lower teeth are very large, knife-shaped, and serrated, with their bases interlocking to form a continuous cutting surface.|$|E

5|$|The nude {{female figure}} is realistically sculpted in high-relief. Her eyes, beneath distinct, joined eyebrows, are hollow, presumably to accept some {{inlaying}} material– a feature common in stone, alabaster, and bronze sculptures of the time, but {{not seen in}} other Mesopotamian clay sculptures. Her full <b>lips</b> <b>are</b> slightly upturned at the corners. She is adorned with a four-tiered headdress of horns, topped by a disk. Her head is framed by two braids of hair, with the bulk of {{her hair in a}} bun in the back and two wedge-shaped braids extending onto her breasts.|$|E
5|$|The {{face and}} the upper <b>lips</b> <b>are</b> reddish to pink, not dark brown to black as in M.mystacinus. Although most of the face is hairy, {{the area around the}} eyes is bare. The {{nostrils}} are heart-shaped, and their back end is broad, as in M.brandtii, not narrow as in M.mystacinus. Several glands are present on the muzzle, most prominently in reproductively active males. The ears are brown and are lighter on the inside than the outside. There is a notch {{at the edge of the}} ear, and the pointed tragus (a projection inside the ear that is present in some bats) extends up to this notch; the tragus is longer, extending beyond the notch, in both M.brandtii and M.mystacinus. The base of the inner side of the ear is white; it is much darker in M.mystacinus. The feet and the thumbs are very small. The small size of the ear, tragus, feet, and thumb distinguishes M.alcathoe from the slightly larger M.mystacinus and M.brandtii, but the feet are relatively larger than in M.mystacinus.|$|E
5|$|The {{way this}} man's dark hair grows, with the sharp {{dip in the}} middle of his high forehead, as though concentrating there all the energy of the {{masculine}} M, makes his face different from all the others. His coal-black eyes are rigidly focused in a gaze that expresses compelling force. The nose is unusually long and boldly curved. The mouth is wide and sensual, but the <b>lips</b> <b>are</b> firmly shut in a straight line, the corners strongly marked and tightened into final points, and this strengthens the impression — already suggested by the eyes — of a strong controlling will. It is an extraordinarily fascinating face, reminding us of faces of famous men, especially of Machiavelli's; and indeed the whole aspect of the head suggests something Mediterranean, as though this man had acquired his frank, searching, superior air at Italian academies.|$|E
5000|$|The {{tropical}} {{shell is}} relatively large. It is columbelliform and longitudinally costellated. The spire is short. The aperture is narrow and elongated. The outer <b>lip</b> <b>is</b> denticulated within. The columellar <b>lip</b> <b>is</b> striated.|$|R

5|$|The winter fur is dense, soft, silky and {{relatively}} long. For the northern foxes, the fur is very long, dense and fluffy, but is shorter, sparser and coarser in southern forms. Among northern foxes, the North American varieties generally have the silkiest guard hairs, while most Eurasian red foxes have coarser fur. There are three main colour morphs; red, silver/black and cross (see Mutations). In the typical red morph, their coats are generally bright reddish-rusty with yellowish tints. A stripe of weak, diffuse patterns of many brown-reddish-chestnut hairs occurs along the spine. Two additional stripes pass down the shoulder blades, which, {{together with the}} spinal stripe, form a cross. The lower back is often a mottled silvery colour. The flanks are lighter coloured than the back, while the chin, lower lips, throat and front of the chest are white. The remaining lower {{surface of the body}} is dark, brown or reddish. During lactation, the belly fur of vixens may turn brick red. The upper parts of the limbs are rusty reddish, while the paws are black. The frontal part of the face and upper neck is bright brownish-rusty red, while the upper <b>lips</b> <b>are</b> white. The backs of the ears are black or brownish-reddish, while the inner surface is whitish. The top of the tail is brownish-reddish, but lighter in colour than the back and flanks. The underside of the tail is pale grey with a straw-coloured tint. A black spot, the location of the supracaudal gland, is usually present {{at the base of the}} tail. The tip of the tail is white.|$|E

50|$|The {{shell is}} thin, pellucid, fragile, white, {{slightly}} convolute, obliquely finely striate, left side slightly inflated. The aperture is large, open widely. The outer <b>lip</b> <b>is</b> disjoined from the apex, very slightly produced posteriorly and truncate. The inner <b>lip</b> <b>is</b> slightly callous.|$|R
5000|$|The outer <b>lip</b> <b>is</b> thin, not descending.

25|$|Raynaud syndrome, {{also known}} as Raynaud's phenomenon, is a medical {{condition}} in which spasm of arteries cause episodes of reduced blood flow. Typically the fingers, and less commonly the toes, are involved. Rarely, the nose, ears, or <b>lips</b> <b>are</b> affected. The episodes result in the affected part turning white and then blue. Often, there is numbness or pain. As blood flow returns, the area turns red and burns. The episodes typically last minutes, but can last up to several hours.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from her}} attributes, {{there seems to}} be a {{relative}} consensus in late sculpture from the Classical period, the 5th century onward, as to what Athena looked like. Most noticeable in the face is perhaps the full round strong, chin with a high nose that has a high bridge as a natural extension of the forehead. The eyes typically are somewhat deeply set. The unsmiling <b>lips</b> <b>are</b> usually full, but the mouth is depicted fairly narrow, usually just slightly wider than the nose. The neck is somewhat long.|$|E
25|$|The {{chimpanzee}} is tailless; its coat is dark; its face, fingers, {{palms of}} the hands, and soles {{of the feet}} are hairless. The exposed skin of the face, hands, and feet varies from pink to very dark in both species, but is generally lighter in younger individuals and darkens with maturity. A University of Chicago Medical Centre study has found significant genetic differences between chimpanzee populations. A bony shelf over the eyes gives the forehead a receding appearance, and the nose is flat. Although the jaws protrude, a chimp's <b>lips</b> <b>are</b> thrust out only when it pouts.|$|E

The length of body is slightly longer than the height at the withers, approximately 104% of the height at withers. The Komondor has a broad head with the muzzle slightly shorter than half of the length of the head, with an even and complete scissor bite. Nose and <b>lips</b> <b>are</b> always black.|$|E
25|$|When she {{is found}} in the temple by the priest she is praying silently, but her <b>lips</b> <b>are</b> moving. A priest called Eli {{witnesses}} this odd posture and concludes she is drunk. In her despair she prays to God for a child and if her prayer is granted she will give the son back to God. After Hannah's explanation of her sobriety, Eli blesses her with peace and a guarantee that God of Israel will grant her request. She goes home, eats and drinks with her husband, and is filled with hope. Subsequently, Hannah becomes pregnant; her child is named Samuel. The time comes to offer the yearly sacrifice at the temple but Hannah stays home. She promises to go to the temple when Samuel is weaned and plans to leave him with Eli to be trained as a Nazirite.|$|E
