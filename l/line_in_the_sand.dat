25|$|At the {{distance}} of a gun-shot from the dune behind which these preparations were in progress, Menéndez had drawn a <b>line</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> with his spear, across the path they were to follow. Then he ordered {{the captain of the}} vanguard which escorted the prisoners that on reaching the place indicated by the line he was to cut off the heads of all of them; he also commanded the captain of the rearguard to do the same. It was Saturday, September 29, the feast of St. Michael; the sun had already set when the Frenchmen reached the mark drawn in the sand near the banks of the lagoon, and the orders of the Spanish admiral were executed. That same night Menéndez returned to St. Augustine, which he reached at dawn.|$|E

500|$|The {{book has}} also been {{attacked}} {{for the quality of}} its journalism and research. The author admitted that much of the material came from the Internet and discharged the burden of proof by claiming that it was for the American government to refute the allegations rather than for him to prove them. This produced anger among authors using more conventional journalistic methods: [...] "The <b>line</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> is when respectable media and publishers start serving up fiction as truth," [...] was the response of Oliver Schrom (whose study of the 9/11 attacks pointed the finger at intelligence failures, rather than a more spectacular claim of CIA complicity).|$|E

[...] From the business perspective, many recognize that the move is likely to affect Google's profits.

According to the reporter's version of Rose's account, when Travis realized that the Mexican army would likely prevail, he drew a <b>line</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> and asked those willing to die for the cause to cross the line. At Bowie's request Crockett and several others carried the cot over the line, leaving Rose alone on the other side. After its publication, several other eyewitnesses confirmed the account, but as Rose was deceased the story can only be authenticated by {{the word of the}} reporter, who admitted to embellishing other articles, [...] "and thus many historians refuse to believe it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The wave {{of success}} {{was to be}} {{short-lived}} for Thomas Cromwell. Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, a traditionalist conservative, was determined to destroy his arch-enemy, Cromwell, by accusing him of supporting heretical preachers, thereby undoing his programme of religious reforms. At the same time, Cromwell's political rival and religious conservative, Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, who had pushed hard for the Act of Six Articles to be passed in Parliament, was rising in favour and fast becoming a threat. The Act of Six Articles, which reaffirmed certain Catholic principles in Henry VIII's Church of England, had been passed in May 1539. Henry VIII had now drawn a <b>line</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> on religious reform and Cromwell found himself in an untenable position with regards to his reformist policies. French Ambassador, Charles de Marillac noted [...] "the division among this King's ministers, {{who are trying to}} destroy each other." [...] Cromwell's party seemed to have the upper hand, however the situation was about to take a turn for the worse.|$|E
2500|$|That evening, James Allen {{became the}} last courier {{to leave the}} Alamo, {{carrying}} messages from Travis {{and several of the}} other men. [...] Legend holds that at some point on March 5, Travis gathered his men and explained that an attack was likely imminent, and that the Mexican Army would likely prevail. [...] He supposedly drew a <b>line</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> and asked those willing to die for the Texian cause to cross and stand alongside him. [...] A bedridden Bowie requested that Crockett and several others carry his cot over the line, leaving only one man, Louis [...] "Moses" [...] Rose on the other side. [...] Explaining that he was not yet ready to die, Rose escaped that evening. [...] This episode was first mentioned in a newspaper article written thirty-five years after the Alamo fell by a reporter who said his parents heard the story directly from Rose. [...] The reporter had admitted to embellishing pieces of the article, and as Rose had died by the time the story was published, so the story could not be authenticated. [...] Years after the story was published, Alamo survivors Susannah Dickinson and Enrique Esparza mentioned the incident, but many details conflicted.|$|E
2500|$|Between the {{alternatives}} of death by starvation {{or at the}} hands of the Spaniards, the night brought no better counsel to the castaways than that of trusting to the Spaniards' mercy. When morning came Ribault returned with six of his captains, and surrendered his own person and arms, the royal standard which he bore, and his seal of office. His captains did the same, and Ribault declared that about seventy of his people were willing to submit, among whom were many noblemen, gentlemen of high connections, and four Germans. The remainder of the company had withdrawn and had even attempted to kill their leader. Then the same actions were performed as on the previous occasion. Diego Flores de Valdes ferried the Frenchmen over in parties of ten, which were successively conducted behind the same sand hill, where their hands were tied behind them. The same excuse was made that they could not be trusted to march unbound to the camp. When the hands of all had been bound except those of Ribault, who was for a time left free, the ominous question was put: [...] "Are you Catholics or Lutherans, and are there any who wish to confess?" [...] Ribault answered that they were all of the new Protestant religion. Menéndez pardoned the drummers, fifers, trumpeters, and four others who said they were Catholics, some seventeen in all. Then he ordered that the remainder should be marched in the same order to the same <b>line</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand,</b> where they were in turn massacred.|$|E
500|$|The film is {{commonly}} {{seen as a}} polarizing one for audiences, with Entertainment Weekly writing in 2004, [...] "Nearly a decade after it earned gazillions and swept the Oscars, Robert Zemeckis's ode to 20th-century America still represents one of cinema's most clearly drawn <b>lines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand.</b> One half of folks {{see it as an}} artificial piece of pop melodrama, while everyone else raves that it's sweet as a box of chocolates." ...|$|R

2500|$|Through Chrétien had {{supported}} Martin in {{his plans for}} cuts, he did not allow Martin {{to go as far}} as he would have liked with cutting various social programs and to devolve spending powers to the provinces as a way of cutting federal government expenditure. As a [...] "hard federalist", Chrétien fiercely objected to what he saw as the [...] "soft federalist" [...] Martin's attempts to weaken the power of the federal government under the guise of cutting the deficit. One senior Liberal later recalled about the Chrétien-Martin debate about reforming Old Age Security that: [...] "Martin had been told [...] "no" [...] by the prime minister three times and still he persisted...his insubordination was unprecedented. It got the point where Chrétien had to draw a <b>line</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> and say [...] "I'm the prime minister and you're the finance minister and I'm saying no!"". Much of the Liberal caucus was deeply unhappy with the 1995 budget, arguing that this was not what they had been elected for in 1993, only to be informed by the Prime Minister that there was no alternative. Chrétien himself expressed his unhappiness with his budget in a radio interview with Peter Gzowski in March 1995, saying about the budget: [...] "It is not our pleasure sir, I have to tell you that. I've been around a long time. It's no pleasure at all. I'm not doctrinaire, a right-winger. I'm a Liberal, and I feel like a Liberal, and it is painful. But it is needed".|$|E

He made crosses and marks and holes, and as he drew the rude map he talked in Yaqui, in Spanish; with a word here and there in English. Belding translated as best he could. The raiders were heading southeast toward the railroad that ran from Nogales down into Sonora. It was four days' travel, bad trail, good sure waterhole one day out; then water not sure for two days. Raiders traveling slow; bothered by too many horses, not looking for pursuit; were never pursued, could be headed and ambushed that night at the first waterhole, a natural trap in a valley.|$|E
