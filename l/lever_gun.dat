5000|$|The Winchester Model 71 {{still has}} a loyal {{following}} for what is arguably [...] "the finest big bore <b>lever</b> <b>gun</b> that has ever been" [...] {{as well as being}} used as a strong and solid platform for various 'wildcat' projects.|$|E
50|$|It {{was dropped}} in 1936, {{along with the}} M95. Loadings {{developing}} 45,000 CUP or over should be avoided in the old M95 <b>lever</b> <b>guns.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lincoln {{received}} the Army-Navy ‘E’ Award five {{times during the}} war. They built special gasoline-powered grease guns {{that could be used}} in the field and a steel suitcase including manual <b>lever</b> <b>guns</b> and the gasoline-drive grease guns used on tanks and other motorized vehicles on the front.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>lever</b> grease <b>gun,</b> the Model 1042, was {{introduced}} during the war. It was so popular, {{it led to}} the standardization of grease tubes (400 g or 14 oz) to fit the device.|$|R
50|$|The gunner was {{occupied}} with manually operating the loading and firing <b>lever,</b> while the <b>gun</b> captain aimed {{the gun and}} operated the elevation and training handwheels.|$|R
5000|$|Lincoln {{patented}} {{the first}} <b>lever</b> grease <b>gun</b> {{to work with}} a full stroke operation called the Model 1242. This meant that a hand-held grease gun could generate up to 10,000 lbf/in² (70 MPa) of pressure. Operators of the unit could push grease into blocked or [...] "frozen" [...] fittings and the unit allowed for work in confined areas.|$|R
50|$|The Volcanic Repeating Arms Company was a U.S. company {{formed in}} 1855 by {{partners}} Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson to develop Walter Hunt's Rocket Ball ammunition and lever action mechanism. Volcanic made an improved {{version of the}} Rocket Ball ammunition, and a carbine and pistol version of the <b>lever</b> action <b>gun</b> to fire it. While the Volcanic Repeating Arms Company was short lived, its descendants, Smith & Wesson and Winchester Repeating Arms Company, became major firearms manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|It had {{a single}} 1.25 inches caliber smooth-bore barrel. The barrel was fed from a revolver-like ring, but with an axis of {{rotation}} perpendicular to the bore, rather than the usual revolver configuration with parallel axes. The cylinder housed 18 copper-lined chambers that were muzzle loaded from the outer side of the ring. The interior side of the multiple-chamber ring was lined with the corresponding 18 percussion cap nipples. The ring was rotated by a hand <b>lever.</b> The <b>gun</b> had a cast iron receiver.|$|R
6000|$|I {{was nearly}} sinking {{off to sleep}} once more and I muttered, [...] "Don't bother me; the gun is {{in the corner of}} the tent." [...] Burton began {{snapping}} the <b>lever</b> of the <b>gun</b> impatiently and whispering something about not being able to put the cartridge in. He was accustomed to the old-fashioned Winchester, but had not tried these.|$|R
50|$|The Rocket Ball, {{patented}} in 1848 by Walter Hunt, {{consisted of}} a lead bullet with a deep hollow in the rear, running {{a majority of the}} length of the cartridge. The hollow, like that of the Minie ball, served to seal the bullet into the bore, but Rocket Ball put the cavity to further use. By packing the deep cavity with powder, and sealing it with a cap with a small hole in the rear for ignition, the Rocket Ball replaced the earlier paper cartridge with a durable package capable of being fed from a magazine. The cap was blown out of the bore upon firing. The Rocket Ball was used in magazine fed <b>lever</b> action <b>guns,</b> allowing the first easily manufactured repeating single chamber firearms.|$|R
