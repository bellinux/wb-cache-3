The largest reductions in drag resulted from sealing the gaps between the wing flaps and nacelle, reducing the thickness of the nacelle training-edge lip, and bringing the under-wing air inlet to the wing leading edge.

40|$|In {{order to}} extend the useful range of Reynolds numbers of {{airfoils}} designed {{to take advantage of}} the extensive laminar boundary layers possible in an air stream of low turbulence, tests were made of the NACA 2412 - 34 and 1412 - 34 sections in the NACA <b>low-turbulence</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Although the possible extent of the laminar boundary layer on these airfoils is not so great as for specially designed laminar-flow airfoils, it is greater than that for conventional airfoils, and is sufficiently extensive so that at Reynolds numbers above 11, 000, 000 the laminar region is expected to be limited by the permissible 'Reynolds number run' and not by laminar separation as is the case with conventional airfoils. Drag measurements by the wake-survey method and pressure-distribution measurements were made at several lift coefficients through a range of Reynolds numbers up to 11, 400, 000. The drag scale-effect curve for the NACA 1412 - 34 is extrapolated to a Reynolds number of 30, 000, 000 on the basis of theoretical calculations of the skin friction. Comparable skin-friction calculations were made for the NACA 23012. The results indicate that, for certain applications at moderate values of the Reynolds number, the NACA 1412 - 34 and 2412 - 34 airfoils offer some advantages over such conventional airfoils as the NACA 23012. The possibility of maintaining a more extensive laminar boundary layer on these airfoils should result in a small drag reduction, and the absence of pressure peaks allows higher speeds to be reached before the compressibility burble is encountered. At lower Reynold numbers, below about 10, 000, 000, these airfoils have higher drags than airfoils designed to operate with very extensive laminar boundary layers...|$|E
