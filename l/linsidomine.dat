After a 2 mg oral dose, molsidomine elimination half-life was prolonged in cirrhotic patients (13. 1 +/- 10. 0 h vs 1. 2 +/- 0. 2 h, P less than 0. 01) {{because of a}} decrease in its apparent plasma clearance (CL/F) (39. 8 +/- 31. 9 ml h- 1 kg- 1 in patients with cirrhosis vs 590 +/- 73 ml h- 1 kg- 1 in volunteers).

40|$|AbstractThis study investigates whether {{nitric oxide}} (NO) release from <b>linsidomine</b> (SIN- 1), the active {{metabolite}} of the antianginal drug molsidomine, is light sensitive.

Under the same conditions (9 -h irradiation) the concentration of oxygen decreased to 2 % of control.

40|$|ABSTRACT [...] Objectives. Recently, {{nitric oxide}} {{was shown to}} be a {{mediator}} of penile erection in men and the nitric oxide donor <b>linsidomine</b> chlorhydrate (StN- 1) was intro-duced as a novel treatment option i patients with erectile dysfunction. We now present our follow-up results with the intracavernous application of SIN- 1. Methods. One hundred thirteen patients with erectile dysfunction of various etiologies and 10 normal control subjects underwent intracavernous pharmacotesting with 1 mg SIN- 1. Of the 113 patients, 71 (62. 8 %) underwent additional pharmacotesting with a mixture of papaverine (15 mg/mL) and phentolamine (0. 5 mg/mL) (P/P). Forty-eight re-sponders to SIN- 1 were enrolled in an autoinjection program with this substance. Results. All normal control subjects had full rigid erections lasting 40 to 70 minutes. Of 113 patients, 78 (69 %) had responses sufficient for intercourse with SIN-l, and the other 35 patients (31 %) demonstrated inadequate responses. All 44 responders to SIN- 1 who also received P/P had erections sufficient for intercourse with P/P in doses of 0. 25 to 2 mL (mean, 0. 6 + 0. 3 mL). Six patients (13. 6 %) had prolonged erections with minimal to moderate doses of P/P. From the total of 27 patients who had erections insufficient fo...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that nigrostriatal dopaminergic transmission is modulated by nitric oxide (NO). Since there is evidence that gonadal hormones can affect extrapyramidal motor behavior in mammals, we investigated the effects of isosorbide dinitrate (ISD), <b>linsidomine</b> (SIN- 1) and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), three pharmacologically different NO donors, on neuroleptic-induced catalepsy in 60 - to 80 -day-old male and female albino mice. Catalepsy was induced with haloperidol (1 mg/kg, ip) and measured at 30 -min intervals by means of a bar test. Drugs (or appropriate vehicle) were injected ip 30 min before haloperidol, with each animal being used only once. ISD (5, 20 and 50 mg/kg) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of catalepsy in male mice (maximal effect 120 min after haloperidol: 64 % inhibition). In the females only at the highest dose of ISD was an attenuation of catalepsy observed, which was mild and short lasting. SIN- 1 (10 and 50 mg/kg) did not significantly affect catalepsy in female mice, while a significant attenuation was observed in males at the dose of 50 mg/kg (maximal inhibition: 60 %). SNAP (20 mg/kg) significantly attenuated catalepsy in males 120 min after haloperidol (44 % inhibition), but had no significant effect on females. These results basically agree with literature data showing that NO facilitates central dopaminergic transmission, although the mechanisms are not fully understood. They also reveal the existence of gender-related differences in this nitrergic modulation in mice, with females being less affected than males...|$|E
40|$|ODQ, (1 H-[1, 2, 4]oxadiazolo][4, 3 -a]quinoxalin- 1 -one, an {{inhibitor}} of soluble guanylate cyclase) inhibits vasorelaxant {{responses to}} nitric oxide (NO) -donor drugs, but {{the extent of}} the inhibition varies depending on the NO donor studied. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the hypothesis that these variations in the effects of ODQ reflect differences in the mechanisms whereby each NO donor generates NO. On pulmonary artery preparations pre-contracted submaximally with phenylephrine, ODQ (3 μM) almost abolished the relaxant responses to glyceryl trinitrate, isosorbide dinitrate and nitroprusside; each of these drugs requires activation in the tissue (by enzymes or reducing agents) to generate NO. In contrast, ODQ (3 μM) caused a parallel shift in the concentration-relaxation curves to <b>linsidomine</b> (SIN- 1), FK 409, MAHMA NONOate and spermine NONOate (1. 63 to 2. 54 log units) with no depression in maximum response; each of these NO donors generates NO in the physiological bathing solution without requiring tissue activation. For the four drugs in this group, the effects of 10 μM ODQ were not significantly greater than the effects of 3 μM ODQ; thus there was an ODQ-resistant component to the response suggesting that part of the response involved a mechanism that was independent of soluble guanylate cyclase. NO donors that require tissue activation probably generate NO within the smooth-muscle cell, whereas those that do not require tissue activation generate NO outside the cell. Hence it is concluded that the site of NO generation (intra- or extracellular) might determine whether or not there is an ODQ-resistant component in the relaxation response...|$|E
40|$|Soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) is an {{important}} effector for nitric oxide (NO). It acts by increasing intracellular cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels to mediate numerous biological functions. Recently, 1 H-[1, 2, 4]oxadiazolo[4, 3,-a]quinoxalin- 1 -one (ODQ) {{was identified as a}} novel and selective inhibitor of this enzyme. Therefore, ODQ may represent {{an important}} pharmacological tool for differentiating cGMP-mediated from cGMP-independent effects of NO. In the present study, we examined the inhibitory action of ODQ both functionally and biochemically. In phenylephrine-preconstricted, endothelium-intact, isolated aortic rings from the rat, ODQ, in a concentration-dependent manner, increased contractile tone and inhibited relaxations to authentic NO with maximal effects at 3 microM. Pretreatment of vascular rings with ODQ induced a parallel, 2 -log-order shift {{to the right of the}} concentration-response curves (CRCs) to histamine, ATP, NO, the NO-donors S-nitrosoglutathione, S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine, and spermine NONOate [N-[4 -[1 -(3 -amino propyl) - 2 -hydroxy- 2 -nitroso hydrazino]butyl]- 1, 3 -propane diamine], and the direct sGC-stimulant [3 -(5 '-hydroxymethyl- 2 'furyl) - 1 -benzyl indazole] YC- 1 but did not affect relaxations induced by papaverine and atriopeptin II. Moreover, the rightward shift of the CRCs to Angeli's salt, peroxynitrite, and <b>linsidomine</b> was similar to that of NO. These results suggested that ODQ is specific for sGC. Furthermore, they indicate that NO can cause vasorelaxation independent of cGMP. Three interesting exceptions were observed to the otherwise rather uniform inhibitory effect of ODQ: the responses to acetylcholine, glycerol trinitrate, and sodium nitroprusside. The latter two agents are known to require metabolic activation, possibly by cytochrome P- 450 -type proteins. The 3 - to 5 -log-order rightward shift of their CRCs suggests that, in addition to sGC, ODQ may interfere with heme proteins involved in the bioactivation of these NO donors and the mechanism of vasorelaxation mediated by acetylcholine. In support of this notion, ODQ inhibited hepatic microsomal NO production from both glycerol trinitrate and sodium nitroprusside as well as NO synthase activity in aortic homogenates. The latter effect seemed to require biotransformation of ODQ. Collectively, these data reveal that ODQ interferes with various heme protein-dependent processes in vascular and hepatic tissue and lacks specificity for sGC...|$|E
40|$|The {{brain is}} a highly fragile organ kept {{separated}} in its unique environment by specialised brain barriers, mainly the aptly named blood-brain barrier (BBB). Apart from being a physical barrier, the BBB also functions as a transport barrier to strictly govern the balance of ions and molecules that traverse between the blood and the brain. In a number of neuropathological conditions, particularly in the highly prevalent and debilitating conditions of stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI), {{the integrity of the}} BBB becomes compromised leading to the dysregulated migration of blood constituents such as platelets, into the brain. Platelets are best known for their primary role in haemostasis. However, it is also known that platelets partake in several non-haemostatic events including immune regulation, angiogenesis, wound healing {{as well as in the}} propagation and migration of cancerous cells. The association of platelets with multiple roles has been attributed to the extensive inventory of bioactive molecules that are released by platelets or exposed on the platelet surface upon platelet activation. Due to its participation in wound repair, platelets in the form of “platelet concentrates” have been exogenously applied in clinical settings to accelerate the recovery of various organs such as skin, tendon, muscle and bone. Surprisingly, despite its widespread use, there is a clear lack of mechanistic insight into precisely how platelets aid in the recovery of these organs. With regard to the role of platelets in the brain, intriguingly, published studies to date have focussed solely on the thrombotic actions of platelets. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the non-thrombotic roles of platelets in the brain. This project builds upon the understanding that upon BBB breakdown, platelets again unimpeded access into the brain where they become activated and release hundreds of bioactive molecules. These bioactive platelet-released molecules (PRMs) have direct contact with injured neurons and thereby may influence brain injury. To address this aim, we show that cerebrospinal fluid from human TBI patients contain elevated levels of soluble GPVI (a platelet marker) compared to cerebrospinal fluid from non-TBI patients; with the mean levels of soluble GPVI measured at 35. 42 ng/mL versus 0 ng/mL, respectively. Interestingly, the amount of GPVI detected within cerebrospinal fluid of TBI patients is comparable to that observed in the plasma of patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation. Next, using a mouse model of TBI, we document that platelet deposition is not confined within cerebral vasculature but that platelets also extravasate in considerable number into the surrounding brain parenchyma. The deposition of platelets within the brain after TBI coincides with BBB breakdown and plasma extravasation. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that platelets that deposit in the brain after TBI become activated thereby intimating the presence of bioactive PRMs with the injured brain. Having established that PRMs do indeed come in contact with injured neurons, we used primary neuronal cultures to study the effects of PRMs on injured neurons. We find that PRMs profoundly protect neurons against injuries induced by etoposide or <b>linsidomine.</b> Contrastingly, PRMs have no influence on the viability of neurons that are challenged with glutamate or subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation conditions. In our neuronal culture system, both etoposide and <b>linsidomine</b> induce apoptosis whereas glutamate and oxygen-glucose deprivation induce necrosis. Therefore, we show that PRMs selectively protect neurons from undergoing apoptosis but have no effect on necrotic injuries. We further demonstrate that the introduction of PRMs after the induction of apoptosis dampens neuronal injury, highlighting the presence of a therapeutic window for the cytoprotective capabilities of PRMs. This remarkable neuroprotective effect of PRMs has never been previously described. Altogether, our novel finding of a selective cytoprotective role of PRMs in neurons extends current understanding of the non-thrombotic role of platelets in the brain. Due to the paucity in efficacious cytoprotective therapies for neuropathological conditions, the isolation of neuroprotective molecule(s) coupled with the identification of how PRMs protect neurons will certainly be beneficial. Studies into these areas will open novel avenues to develop therapeutic strategies that may ultimately impact on the treatment and recovery of patients that sustain brain injury. Accordingly, we further pursued two avenues of investigation: 1) to determine which molecule(s) within the plethora of bioactive PRMs are responsible for its cytoprotective actions and 2) to determine the neuronal signal transduction events that mediate the cytoprotective actions of PRMs. To address the first objective, we separated PRMs into fractions using ion-exchange chromatography and assessed the capacity of these fractions to inhibit apoptosis. We uncovered several fractions that significantly prevent apoptosis. Within these fractions, we identified 6 candidate anti-apoptotic proteins namely: haemoglobin, profilin-I, GAPDH, aldolase A, immunoglobulin and CXCL 7. Importantly, these identified molecules have no known thrombotic actions. Consistent with this notion, we show that 5 out of the 7 cytoprotective fractions do not cause platelet aggregation. Thus, we have not only narrowed the identities of cytoprotective molecules within PRMs to a number of candidates, but also uncoupled the cytoprotective function of platelets from their pro-thrombotic role; thereby substantially increasing the therapeutic potential of PRMs. To address the second objective, we used a phospho-protein microarray to show that in etoposide-injured neurons, PRMs cause differential up-regulation of 25 molecules and down-regulation of 44 molecules. Based on this, we find that neuronal activation of the following kinases: p 38 α, JNK 1, JAK 1 and DNA-PK, mediates the cytoprotective actions of PRMs. Interestingly, the anti-apoptotic action of PRMs is not restricted to neurons, as we find that PRMs also protect human U 937 cells (a leukaemic monocyte lymphoma cell line) from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. The ability of PRMs and its fractions to inhibit apoptosis in U 937 cells denotes that in addition to the other known contributions of platelets to tumour growth and progression, platelets also confer significant protection to cancerous cells against chemotherapy. As such, efforts to counteract the anti-apoptotic effect of PRMs represent an interesting prospect to reduce chemoresistance of tumour cells and thereby improve cancer prognosis. Taken together, our findings of an anti-apoptotic role of platelets have implications not only for brain injury where there is a clear lack of neuroprotective therapies; but also bears substantial consequences to treatment of cancer whereby chemoresistance of cancer cells remains a major challenge. Given that platelet concentrates are currently used in clinical settings to aid recovery, this highlights the clinical applicability of our findings. Altogether, we provide novel evidence supporting the applicability of platelet concentrates in any situation where platelet activation and widespread apoptosis coincide...|$|E
