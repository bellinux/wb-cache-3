25|$|Police {{reportedly}} spent {{thousands of}} hours comparing DNA, dental records and fingerprints to many different missing person cases. Consequently, {{it was not until}} June 26, 1998 when her body was positively identified, through DNA and dental comparison over a year after her death. After viewing the television show, America's Most Wanted that aired in December 1998, which documented the case, Creek's father had notified police that he suspected that the body belonged to his daughter. When Creek had first vanished, she was not reported missing for five weeks, as her history of running away had prevented investigation. After the identification, laws in the state were changed to prevent an issue <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>from</b> happening again.|$|E

[...] "We have a lot of work , and we will keep doing all we can to prevent tragedies <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>from</b> happening", Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in his April 18 keynote address at F8, Facebook's annual developers' conference.

2500|$|In Early Buddhism, the Sigalovada Sutta of the Digha Nikaya in the Pali Canon {{describes}} the respect {{that one is}} expected to give to one's spouse. However, since the ideal of Early Buddhism is renunciation, {{it can be seen}} from examples such as the story of the monk Nanda and his wife Janapada Kalyāni that striving for the [...] of Nirvana is valued above romantic love and marriage. Despite having married her just that day, encouraged by his cousin Gautama Buddha, Nanda left his wife to become a bhikkhu in the Buddhist Sangha. In stories <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>from</b> the Pali Canon, romantic love is generally perceived as part of attachment to samsara, the endless cycle of rebirth. Susan Murcott has pointed out that Early Buddhist attitudes to romantic love and marriage generally reflect the Brahmanic ideals of India at the time... including the recent rise of the renunciate ideal and the associated decline in the status of romantic love and marriage.|$|E
2500|$|The Mufti {{was well}} aware that the European Jews were being wiped out; he never claimed the contrary. [...] Nor, unlike some of his present-day admirers, did he play the ignoble, perverse, and stupid game of Holocaust denial.... His amour-propre would not allow him to justify himself to the Jews....gloating that the Jews had paid a much higher price than the Germans... he cites...: 'Their losses in the Second World War {{represent}} more than thirty {{percent of the total}} number of their people ...'. Statements <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> <b>from</b> a man who was well placed to know what the Nazis had done ... constitute a powerful argument against Holocaust deniers. [...] Husseini reports that Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler ... told him in summer 1943 that the Germans had ‘already exterminated more than three million’ Jews: [...] "I was astonished by this figure, as I had known nothing about the matter until then." ...Thus. in 1943, Husseini knew about the genocide....|$|E
2500|$|On 17 August 2009, CIAIAC {{released}} an interim {{report on the}} incident. The interim report confirmed the preliminary report's conclusion that the crash was caused by an attempt to take off with the flaps and slats retracted, which constituted an improper configuration, and noted that safeguards that should have prevented the crash failed to do so. The cockpit recordings revealed that the pilots omitted the [...] "set and check the flap/slat lever and lights" [...] item in the After Start checklist. In the Takeoff Imminent verification checklist the copilot had simply repeated the correct flap and slat position values without actually checking them, {{as shown by the}} physical evidence. All three safety barriers provided to avoid the takeoff in an inappropriate configuration were defeated: the configuration checklist, the confirm and verify checklist, and the Take-off Warning System (TOWS). The report also made a number of safety recommendations intended to prevent incidents <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>from</b> happening again.|$|E

2500|$|Simcha Jacobovici, {{involved}} {{in the production of}} a documentary on Freund's work for the National Geographic Channel, stated that the biblical Tarshish (which he believes is the same as Tartessos) was Atlantis, and that [...] "Atlantis was hiding in the Tanach". Aren Maeir, a professor of archeology at Bar-Ilan University said [...] "a lot of people have made many crazy claims about Atlantis – it’s one of those classic places where you have a lunatic fringe looking for all types of things. And Richard Freund is known as someone who makes 'sensational' finds. I would say that I am exceptionally skeptical about the thing, but I wouldn’t discount it 100% until I see the details, which haven’t been published as far as I know...every few years we hear something <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>from</b> him...

2500|$|Kimmitt also {{acknowledged}} that he knew of other cases of abuse during the American occupation of Iraq. Bill Cowan, a former Marine lieutenant colonel, was also interviewed, and said: [...] "We went into Iraq to stop things <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>from</b> happening, and indeed, here they are happening under our tutelage." [...] In addition, Rather interviewed Army Reserve Staff Sergeant Ivan Frederick, who was party {{to some of the}} abuses. Frederick's civilian job was as a corrections officer at a Virginia prison. He said, [...] "We had no support, no training whatsoever. And I kept asking my chain of command for certain things ... like rules and regulations, and it just wasn't happening." [...] Frederick's video diary, sent home from Iraq, provided some of the images used in the story. In it he listed detailed, dated, entries that chronicled abuse of CIA prisoners, as well as their names: [...] "The next day the medics came in and put his body on a stretcher, placed a fake [...] in his arm and took him away. This [...] was never processed and therefore never had a number." [...] Frederick implicated the Military Intelligence Corps as well, saying [...] "MI has been present and witnessed such activity. MI has encouraged and told us great job [...] that they were now getting positive results and information." ...|$|E
