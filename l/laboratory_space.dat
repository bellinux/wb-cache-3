5|$|Encompassing , the Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry Building stood {{three stories}} tall. The second and first floors (the latter of which lies {{partially}} below ground) contained <b>laboratory</b> <b>space</b> while {{the third floor}} consisted of communal and teaching spaces like classrooms and offices. Other offices {{on the first floor}} were lit via skylights. The stairwells in Mudd were designed with the purpose of discouraging students from passing through lab spaces to get {{from one side of the}} building to the other. In spite of this, Michael J. Crosbie reported in Architecture in 1986 that students had taken to passing through the building as a shortcut instead of going around it. Furnishings and carpeting in the building were deep blue and rust-colored.|$|E
5|$|These {{challenges}} {{are included in}} the goals of the Office of Research on Women's Health, in the United States, as is the goal of facilitating women's access to careers in biomedicine. The ORWH believes that {{one of the best ways}} to advance research in women's health is to increase the proportion of women involved in healthcare and health research, as well as assuming leadership in government, centres of higher learning, and in the private sector. This goal acknowledges the glass ceiling that women face in careers in science and in obtaining resources from grant funding to salaries and <b>laboratory</b> <b>space.</b> The National Science Foundation in the United States states that women only gain half of the doctorates awarded in science and engineering, fill only 21% of full-time professor positions in science and 5% of those in engineering, while earning only 82% of the remuneration their male colleagues make. These figures are even lower in Europe.|$|E

25|$|The ATV {{was one of}} the quietest {{places on}} the ISS, as it was {{isolated}} {{from the rest of the}} station. Because of this, the crew used it as sleeping quarters, and also as a place to perform personal hygiene activities.

25|$|Early {{proposals}} for the campus came from Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge; Stephen Child; Constant-Désiré Despradelle; and John Ripley Freeman. Shepley's and Child's plans incorporated Georgian Revival styled, L-shaped, brick buildings set on symmetric grass avenues or quads, {{much like the}} recently completed Harvard Medical School, but were inappropriately sized for the industrial research that would occur within. Despradelle's Beaux-Arts proposal would have partitioned the campus into separate zones for academic, research, and residential activities, but its World's-Fair-like layout provided insufficient space for laboratories. His later iterations solved the <b>laboratory</b> <b>space</b> problems, but provided uncomfortable proximity and insufficient space for the residences {{as well as being}} enormously expensive.|$|E
25|$|The university's third chancellor, Daniel Edward Ferritor, {{continued}} and completed {{the restoration of}} Old Main, during his eleven-year term. Chief among Ferritor's accomplishments was the addition of another two million square feet in classroom and <b>laboratory</b> <b>space</b> {{at a cost of}} $120 million, as well as boosting annual giving to the university from three million to twenty million dollars. Following Ferritor was John A. White, perhaps best known for overseeing the Campaign for the 21st Century, which raised over one billion dollars for the university endowments over an eight-year period. White resigned in 2008 following the tempestuous release of Houston Nutt from his position as the head coach of the school's football program. In a unanimous vote, the board of trustees elected G. David Gearhart to be the fifth chancellor in school history.|$|E
25|$|A {{sympathetic}} administrator proved {{vital to}} {{building up the}} physics department at Columbia. Pegram hired Isidor Isaac Rabi as a theoretical physicist on Heisenberg's advice. Rabi would later succeed Pegram {{as chairman of the}} physics department. When Pegram heard that Nobel Prize-winning physicist Enrico Fermi wanted to emigrate to the United States with his family to escape Italian Racial Laws that affected his Jewish wife Laura, Pegram was quick to offer a position at Columbia. Recruiting Fermi was a coup; he had offers from four other universities, and Pegram was on the wharf to greet Fermi on his arrival in New York on January 2, 1939. Pegram supported the work of Leo Szilard, granting him access to facilities and <b>laboratory</b> <b>space</b> in the Pupin Physics Laboratories. Other scientists working at Columbia in 1939 included Herbert L. Anderson, Eugene T. Booth, G. Norris Glasoe, Francis G. Slack and Walter Zinn, {{making it one of the}} world's most important centers for nuclear physics.|$|E
50|$|The Allied Health {{construction}} project was constructed during the 2014-15 academic year and includes {{the addition of}} more <b>laboratory</b> <b>spaces</b> for the health field degree programs offered at BGSU Firelands. This addition opened {{in the spring of}} 2016.|$|R

25|$|At {{the end of}} 1920, Macleod was {{approached}} by Frederick Grant Banting, a young Canadian physician who had the idea of curing diabetes using an extract from a pancreas whose functioning had been disrupted. Macleod was not enthusiastic, because (unlike Banting) he knew about unsuccessful experiments in this direction by other researchers. He thought {{it more likely that}} the nervous system had a crucial role in regulating blood glucose concentration. Even though Banting had virtually no experience of physiology, he managed to convince Macleod to lend him <b>laboratory</b> <b>space</b> during a vacation in Scotland that summer. In addition to the laboratory, Macleod provided experimental animals and his student Charles Herbert Best, who worked as a demonstrator. Macleod also advised on project planning and the use of analytical techniques, and assisted with the operation on the first dog. While Macleod was away, Banting and Best achieved a breakthrough: they isolated an internal secretion of the pancreas and succeeded in reducing the blood sugar level of another dog, whose pancreas had been surgically removed.|$|E
25|$|The {{research}} effort suffered several blows in 2013. In January 2013, {{a quarter}} of MSU's tenure-track faculty told Cruzado {{that they did not}} see the university putting money into hiring advanced faculty, improving research faculty salaries, improving <b>laboratory</b> <b>space,</b> or working {{to increase the number of}} graduate students—elements they said would go far to maintaining or improving the university's status as a high-activity research university. Research income for the 2012-2013 school year fell 16.6 percent to $93.7 million, which Cruzado said was due to federal budget cuts. On May 20, 2013, MSU's long-time Vice President for Research, Creativity and Technology Transfer, Thomas McCoy, left the university to take a similar position at the University of North Texas. Anne Camper, Associate Dean of the College of Engineering, was named interim vice president. That same month, an informal faculty poll showed that maintaining MSU's reputation as a high-activity research university was the highest priority of faculty. But tension between research faculty and non-research faculty was also very high. The number of graduate and doctoral students at the university also slipped. Graduate students (which included master's degree and doctoral degree students was 1,980 in 2010-2011, but just 1,888 in 2012-2013. The university strategic plan set a goal of 2,350 graduate students by 2019. The number of doctoral students was also inconsistent. There were 45 in 2010-2011, 56 in 2011-2012, but just 53 in 2013-2013. The strategic plan set a goal of 80 per year by 2019.|$|E

500|$|The expedition's hut, a {{prefabricated}} structure measuring 33 x 19feet (10m x 5.8m), {{was ready}} for occupation {{by the end of}} February. It was divided into a series of mainly two-person cubicles, with a kitchen area, a darkroom, storage and <b>laboratory</b> <b>space.</b> The ponies were housed in stalls built on the most sheltered side of the hut, while the dog kennels were placed close to the porch. Shackleton's inclusive leadership style, in contrast to that of Scott, meant no demarcation between upper and lower decks—all lived, worked and ate together. Morale was high; as assistant geologist Philip Brocklehurst recorded, Shackleton [...] "had a faculty for treating each member of the expedition as though he were valuable to it".|$|E
500|$|In 1952, Fenn {{moved to}} Princeton University as Director of Project SQUID, {{a program to}} support {{research}} related to jet propulsion that {{was funded by the}} Office of Naval Research.

[...] After working with Project SQUID, Fenn returned to Yale University in 1967. [...] He held a joint appointment in the chemistry and engineering departments until 1987, conducting much of his research in Mason Laboratory. [...] In 1987, Fenn had reached Yale's mandatory retirement age.

500|$|Marie {{had begun}} her {{scientific}} career in Paris with {{an investigation of}} the magnetic properties of various steels, commissioned by the Society for the Encouragement of National Industry (Société d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale [...] ). That same year Pierre Curie entered her life; it was their mutual interest in natural sciences that drew them together. Pierre was an instructor at the School of Physics and Chemistry, the École supérieure de physique et de chimie industrielles de la ville de Paris (ESPCI). They were introduced by the Polish physicist, Professor Józef Wierusz-Kowalski, who had learned that Marie was looking for a larger <b>laboratory</b> <b>space,</b> something that Wierusz-Kowalski thought Pierre had access to.
