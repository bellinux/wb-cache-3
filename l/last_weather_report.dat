50|$|At 23:49:32, the {{controller}} issued its <b>last</b> <b>weather</b> <b>report</b> before Flight 1420 landed, advising that winds {{at the airport}} were 330 degrees at 25 knots. The reported winds exceeded the MD-82's 20-knot crosswind limit for landing in reduced visibility on a wet runway. Despite the excessive crosswind and two wind shear reports, Captain Buschmann did not abandon the aircraft's approach into Little Rock, instead deciding to continue the approach to runway 4R.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the last}} 22 {{seconds of the}} flight, the crew twice more radioed Maputo about the runway lights, affirming {{that they were not}} in sight, which was {{eventually}} acknowledged by the Maputo controller. Meanwhile, the captain stated [...] "cloudy, cloudy, cloudy" [...] and the navigator exclaimed [...] "no, no, there's nowhere to go, there's no NDBs, nothing!". The captain then added [...] "Neither NDBs, nor ILS!", which were the last words recorded on the CVR. The aircraft first impacted terrain at 21:21:39, approximately 35 nmi km west of Maputo in a hilly region at an elevation of 2185 ft. At the time of the accident, it was a very dark night, a few minutes before moonrise. The <b>last</b> <b>weather</b> <b>report</b> passed to the aircraft indicated 10 km of visibility with 3/8 cloud cover at 1,800 feet.|$|E
50|$|A {{statistical}} significance test {{is intended to}} test a hypothesis. If the hypothesis summarizes a set of data, there is no value {{in testing the hypothesis}} on that set of data. Example: If a study of <b>last</b> year's <b>weather</b> <b>reports</b> indicates that rain in a region falls primarily on weekends, it is only valid to test that null hypothesis on <b>weather</b> <b>reports</b> from any other year. Testing hypotheses suggested by the data is circular reasoning that proves nothing; It is a special limitation on the choice of the null hypothesis.|$|R
