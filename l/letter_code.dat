5|$|IUPAC {{also has}} a system for giving codes to {{identify}} amino acids and nucleotide bases. IUPAC needed a coding system that represented long sequences of amino acids. This would allow for these sequences to be compared {{to try to find}} homologies. These codes can consist of either a one <b>letter</b> <b>code</b> or a three <b>letter</b> <b>code.</b>|$|E

25|$|Amino acid {{substitution}} (e.g., D111E) — The {{first letter}} {{is the one}} <b>letter</b> <b>code</b> of the wild-type amino acid, the number is {{the position of the}} amino acid from the N-terminus, and the second letter is the one <b>letter</b> <b>code</b> of the amino acid present in the mutation. Nonsense mutations are represented with an X for the second amino acid (e.g. D111X).|$|E
50|$|<b>Letter</b> <b>codes</b> {{have been}} defined by Underwriters Labs (UL) to {{describe}} various attributes and ratings of portable cords. The Canadian Standards Association (CSA) also has defined similar <b>letter</b> <b>codes,</b> and ongoing standards harmonization should eventually resolve minor differences.|$|R

50|$|There {{were many}} ratios offered over the {{lifetime}} of the AMC 20. <b>Letter</b> <b>codes</b> were stamped on the axle to indicate installed gears. AMC changed or reused <b>letter</b> <b>codes</b> during the axle's long life.There are other gear ratios available in the aftermarket.|$|R
25|$|The {{percentage}} of allowed {{deviation from the}} rated value is called tolerance. The actual capacitance value should be within its tolerance limits, or {{it is out of}} specification. IEC/EN 60062 specifies a <b>letter</b> <b>code</b> for each tolerance.|$|E
25|$|Film {{capacitors}} {{are available}} in different tolerance series, whose values are specified in the E series standards specified in IEC/EN 60063. For abbreviated marking in tight spaces, a <b>letter</b> <b>code</b> for each tolerance is specified in IEC/EN 60062.|$|E
25|$|For clothes where {{a larger}} step size is sufficient, the {{standard}} also defines a <b>letter</b> <b>code.</b> This code represents the bust girth {{for women and}} the chest girth for men. The standard does not define such a code for children.|$|E

25|$|The {{percentage}} of allowed deviation of the capacitance from the rated value is called capacitance tolerance. The actual capacitance value must {{be within the}} tolerance limits, or the capacitor is out of specification. For abbreviated marking in tight spaces, a <b>letter</b> <b>code</b> for each tolerance is specified in IEC/EN 60062.|$|E
25|$|The {{percentage}} of allowed deviation of the measured capacitance from the rated value is called capacitance tolerance. Electrolytic capacitors {{are available in}} different tolerance series classifications, whose values are specified in the E series specified in IEC 60063. For abbreviated marking in tight spaces, a <b>letter</b> <b>code</b> for each tolerance is specified in IEC 60062.|$|E
25|$|Before the Civil War, the B {{organized}} its locomotives {{into four}} classes, based upon relative power. After the war this was {{felt to be}} inadequate, and a classification scheme was devised, based upon wheel arrangement. Each wheel arrangement was assigned a letter, except for 4-4-0 locomotives, which were subdivided according to cylinder size. When articulated steam locomotives were first introduced, they were assigned a single class ("O"). This proved inadequate almost immediately and a two <b>letter</b> <b>code</b> was used instead, based on treating the locomotive {{as if it were}} two engines coupled back-to-back.|$|E

25|$|The {{plugs and sockets}} used in {{each country}} are set by {{national}} standards, {{some of which are}} listed in the IEC technical report TR 60083, Plugs and socket-outlets for domestic and similar general use standardized in member countries of IEC. The IEC also maintains a Web page giving arbitrary letter designations for generally compatible types of plugs. The IEC Web page does not identify the national standards corresponding to each plug letter. The letter codes are often used as a de facto naming standard when comparing different AC power plugs, especially when describing travel adaptors. Physically identical sockets may be connected to voltages incompatible with an appliance. The letter codes do not identify all the variants of a plug and socket family for different current ratings or for special purposes, and not all plug types have been assigned letters. Where an IEC <b>letter</b> <b>code</b> exists it is shown in this article.|$|E
25|$|Thai Industrial Standard (TIS) 166-2547 and its {{subsequent}} update TIS 166-2549 replaced prior standards which {{were based on}} NEMA 1-15 and 5-15, as Thailand uses 220 V electricity. The plug has two round power pins 4.8mm in diameter and 19mm in length, insulated for 10mm and spaced 19mm apart, with an earthing pin of the same diameter and 21.4mm in length, located 11.89mm from the line connecting the two power pins. The earth pin spacing corresponds to that of NEMA 5 and provides compatibility with prior hybrid three-pin sockets, which accept NEMA 1-15, NEMA 5-15 and Europlugs, {{all of which have}} been variably used in Thailand. The hybrid socket is also defined in TIS 166-2547, in addition to a plain three-round-pin socket, with plans to replace the former and phase out support for NEMA-compatible plugs. Sockets are polarised (as in NEMA 5-15). The plug is similar to, but not interchangeable with, the Israeli SI32 plug. The Thai plug has not been designated with a <b>letter</b> <b>code</b> at IEC World Plugs.|$|E

In later models, a 6 means the front axle capacity is 6 tonnes. The S in types VAKS, AS and NS meant sotilas (soldier); they were intended for military use.|$|E

500|$|After persuading {{her that}} she wants to find the truth and help, Imelda allows Nico to access Carchon's room, which {{contains}} an elephant carving–the same as one Nico received from her father, who had carved it himself, and a stone cylinder, which contained a hidden <b>letter</b> <b>code.</b> On Carchon's corpse, Nico discovers a ticket stamped [...] "Bateaux de la Conciergerie" [...] and goes to investigate the dock where the Conciergerie was. By using the letters on the cylinder, she discovers a secret office area where Carchon and many others met for business. After she writes her story up, her editor Ronnie tells her to drop it, at which Nico becomes angry. However, she receives a mysterious phone call from a man called Plantard, who tells her he needs to speak to her about her story.|$|E
