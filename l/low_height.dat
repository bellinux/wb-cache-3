5|$|In 2008, 30,000 {{vehicles}} a day {{traveled on}} the expressway, which fulfilled state expectations; however, complaints were {{made about the}} toll machines, due to their <b>low</b> <b>height</b> and needing the exact amount of the toll. In late 2009, the South Bay Expressway partnership that operated the road questioned {{the value of the}} toll road for property tax purposes, saying that it was worth $330 million less than it was originally valued due to the low volumes of traffic using the road. On March 22, 2010, the toll road's operator filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing traffic counts running at less than 40 percent of initial estimates due to the economic downturn. Some drivers chose not to use the toll road due to a recent increase in tolls. An editorial in the San Diego Union-Tribune also blamed the delay in opening the toll road and the associated penalties, interest, and legal fees for the company's financial status. According to the bankruptcy filing, the expressway had $510 million of loans outstanding, of which $170 million was owed to the U.S. Department of Transportation. In addition, there was over $600 million of unresolved litigation with the construction contractors. The gross earnings (EBITDA) for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009 were approximately $3 million on revenues of $21 million.|$|E

25|$|There {{was concern}} among Sri Lankan media {{as to why}} the {{aircraft}} weren't intercepted before reaching the capital. An Air Force spokesman said since the Tamil Tiger craft were flying at extremely <b>low</b> <b>height</b> of around , it was impossible for the fighter aircraft of the Air Force to engage them. He said that instead the Air Force was ready to shoot down the planes using anti-aircraft guns when they reached Colombo.|$|E
25|$|Aircraft {{are a major}} threat, {{making the}} use of boats against any fleet with air cover very risky. The <b>low</b> <b>height</b> of the radar mast makes it {{difficult}} to acquire and lock onto a target while maintaining a safe distance. As a result, fast attack craft are being replaced for use in naval combat by larger corvettes, which are able to carry radar-guided anti-aircraft missiles for self-defense, and helicopters for over-the-horizon targeting.|$|E
25|$|The {{relatively}} <b>low</b> <b>height</b> {{of most of}} the fells means that, while snow {{is expected}} during the winter, they can be free of snow at any time of the year. Normally, significant snow fall only occurs between November and April. On average, snow falls on Helvellyn 67 days per year. During the year, valleys typically experience 20 days with snow falling, a further 200 wet days, and 145 dry days. Hill fog is common at any time of year, and the fells average only around 2.5 hours of sunshine per day, increasing to around 4.1 hours per day on the coastal plains.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the roof}} of the Froghall tunnel has always been {{extremely}} low, the 2003 restoration included lowering the water level in the pound after dredging, and thus the headroom in the tunnel was improved to 5ft (1.52m) with a beam of 6ft 8ins (2.03m). Unfortunately the new moorings just past the tunnel remain relatively little used, as many modern boats are still too high to pass through the tunnel. A height profile gauge is located at the exit of Flintmill Lock 17 to indicate if a boat has sufficient clearance to pass through the tunnel. The <b>low</b> <b>height</b> restriction would similarly affect proposals to reopen stretches of the Uttoxeter Canal to boating.|$|E
25|$|The {{sinking of}} Titanic {{revealed}} serious faults {{in the design}} of the Olympic-class liners, necessitating a major refit for Olympic in late 1912 and major changes to Britannic, still in the early phases of construction. Titanic had sunk because her six forward compartments had been breached, above the keel but below the waterline, bypassing the double-bottom completely. The <b>low</b> <b>height</b> of the bulkheads had also failed the ship, allowing for uncontrolled flooding once the water in the breached compartments had reached E Deck. The refit on Olympic raised the middle five bulkheads to B Deck, the others to D Deck and also extended the double-bottom along the hull up to G Deck. These improvements were incorporated into Britannic, along with two additional bulkheads. Such improvements meant that both Olympic and Britannic could survive the scenario that had caused their sister ship to founder.|$|E
25|$|The main {{disadvantages}} of the side-lever engine were {{that it was}} large and heavy, and for inland waterway and coastal service, it was soon replaced by lighter and more efficient designs. It remained the dominant engine type for oceangoing service {{through much of the}} first half of the 19th century however, due to its relatively low centre of gravity which gave ships more stability in heavy seas. It was also a common early engine type for warships, since its relatively <b>low</b> <b>height</b> made it less susceptible to battle damage. From the first Royal Navy steam vessel in 1820 until 1840, 70 steam vessels entered service, the majority with side-lever engines, using boilers set to 4psi maximum pressure. The low steam pressures dictated the large cylinder sizes for the side-lever engines, though the effective pressure on the piston was the difference between the boiler pressure and the vacuum in the condenser.|$|E

25|$|Both CR and WR competed {{to acquire}} the rake, with WR even announcing a time table for {{operating}} the air-conditioned rake. Union Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu announced that the rake would be transferred to CR on 16 March 2016. However, at a height of 4.335 metres the rake exceeds the maximum clearance height of 4.270 metres for EMU coaches on the Central Line. In particular, the rake cannot clear the some <b>low</b> <b>height</b> British-era bridges between CST and Kurla. Then Central Railway general manager Sunil Kumar Sood insisted that CR was conduct trials and operate the rake on the Harbour Line. After acquiring the rake, CR conducted tests, safety and mobility checks, and trial runs {{under the supervision of}} the RDSO. However, following Sood's retirement, CR abandoned plans to operate the rake in December 2016. CR informed the Railway Board that it could not operate the rake due to the clearance issue, and the Railway Board directed them to transfer the rake to WR. The rake was transferred to WR on 12 May 2017. WR General Manager Anil Kumar Gupta stated that rake would begin commercial operations on the Western Line after WR conducted its own tests and trial runs and receiving regulatory approvals. Although there are some clearance issues on the Western Line as well, Gupta stated that these could rectified.|$|E
500|$|Welsh Corgis have {{historically}} been used as herding dogs, specifically for cattle. They are {{of the type of}} herding dog referred to as [...] "heelers", meaning that they would nip at the heels of the larger animals to keep them on the move. Both Pembrokeshire and Cardigan are historically agricultural areas of Wales. The combination of the <b>low</b> <b>height</b> off the ground and innate agility of Welsh Corgis would allow them to avoid the hooves of cattle. The term [...] "corgi" [...] means either cur dog or dwarf dog (cor = dwarf, gi = lenitive of ci, dog) in the Welsh language, which was not intended as an insult to the dog's size, rather as a purely descriptive term. There is also a folk legend that says corgis were a gift from the woodland fairies, and that the breed's markings were left on its coat by fairy harnesses and saddles.|$|E
500|$|Small, {{relatively}} weak landspouts may be visible {{only as a}} small swirl of dust on the ground.

A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relative <b>low</b> <b>height</b> is sometimes referred to as a [...] "stovepipe" [...] tornado. Large single-vortex tornadoes can look like large wedges stuck into the ground, and so are known as [...] "wedge tornadoes" [...] or [...] "wedges". The [...] "stovepipe" [...] classification is also used for this type of tornado if it otherwise fits that profile. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds, wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground. Even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance. Many, but not all major tornadoes are wedges.|$|E

40|$|We have {{measured}} the widths of spectral lines from a polar coronal hole using the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer on board Hinode. Polar coronal holes are regions of open magnetic {{field and the}} source of the fast solar wind. We find that the line widths decrease at relatively <b>low</b> <b>heights.</b> Previous observations have attributed such decreases to systematic effects, but we find that such effects are too small to explain our results. We conclude that the line narrowing is real. The non-thermal line widths are believed to be proportional to the amplitude of Alfvén waves propagating along these open field lines. Our results suggest that Alfvén waves are damped at unexpectedly <b>low</b> <b>heights</b> in a polar coronal hole. We derive an estimate on the upper limit for the energy dissipated between 1. 1 R ☉ and 1. 3 R ☉ and find that it is enough to account for up to 70 % of that required to heat the polar coronal hole and accelerate the solar wind...|$|R
