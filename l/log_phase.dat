5|$|Bacterial growth follows four phases. When a {{population}} of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase of growth is the lag phase, a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth. The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced. The second phase of growth is the <b>log</b> <b>phase,</b> {{also known as the}} logarithmic or exponential phase. The <b>log</b> <b>phase</b> is marked by rapid exponential growth. The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the growth rate (k), and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the generation time (g). During <b>log</b> <b>phase,</b> nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The third phase of growth is the stationary phase and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport. The final phase is the death phase where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die.|$|E

The CRP- 3 drillhole extended to 939. 42 mbsf (meters below seafloor) at a water depth of 297 m. The first downhole measurements after drilling were the temperature and salinity logs. Both were measured at the beginning and at the end of each of the three <b>logging</b> <b>phases.</b> Although an equilibrium temperature state may not have been fully reached after drilling, the temperature and salinity profiles seem to be scarcely disturbed. The average overall temperature gradient calculated from all temperature measurements is 28. 5 K/km; remarkably lower than the temperature gradients found in other boreholes in the western Ross See and the Transantarctic Mountains. Anomalies in the salinity profiles at the beginning of each <b>logging</b> <b>phase</b> were no longer present at the end of the corresponding <b>logging</b> <b>phase.</b> This pattern indicates that drilling mud invaded the formation during drilling operations and flowed back into the borehole after drilling ceased. Thus, zones of temperature and salinity anomalies identify permeable zones in the formation and may be pathways for fluid flow. Radiogenic heat production, calculated from the radionuclide contents, is relatively low, with average values between 0. 5 and 1. 0 pW/m 3. The highest values (up to 2 µW/m 3) were obtained for the lower part of the Beacon Sandstone below 855 mbsf. The heat flow component due to radiogenic heat production integrated over the entire borehole is 0. 7 mW/m 2. Thermal conductivities range from 1. 3 to 3 W/mK with an average value of 2. 1 W/mK over the Tertiary section. Together with the average temperature gradient of 28. 5 K/km this yields an average heat flow value of 60 mW/m 2...|$|R

No {{significant changes in}} activities of other pyrimidine ribonucleoside or 2 ′-deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate nucleotidohydrolases were detected. dUTP and dUMP inhibit the dTTPase activity, whereas dTTP failed to inhibit dUTPase activity.

40|$|Since {{the optimal}} {{antimicrobial}} therapy for infections caused by Listeria monocytogenes, particularly in patients allergic to penicillin, is uncertain, we investigated the in vitro effects of erythromycin, alone and {{in combination with}} other antibiotics, on listeriae. Seven strains of listeriae were inhibited but not killed by erythromycin, penicillin G, or ampicillin when tested by a microtiter broth dilution method. Susceptibility to gentamicin decreased when tryptose phosphate broth was substituted for Mueller-Hinton broth, but was independent of their calcium and magnesium concentrations. Quantitative killing studies performed with erythromycin combined with either penicillin G or ampicillin yielded antagonism for all strains, in contrast to microtiter checkerboard determinations, which did not indicate antagonism in all instances. Antagonism occurred with strains in both the stationary and <b>log</b> <b>phases</b> of growth and was slightly reversed by a 120 -min preincubation of the listeriae with penicillin before the addition of erythromycin. Erythromycin and gentamicin were antagonistic in quantitative killing studies.

Alginate biosynthetic activity was determined with a mucoid cell line derived from a cystic fibrosis isolate and containing an alginate algC promoter fused to a lacZ reporter gene. Reporter activity was demonstrated with chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates for beta-galactosidase. Expression of algC was shown to be upregulated in biofilm cells compared with planktonic cells in liquid medium. Gene up-expression correlated with alginate biosynthesis as measured by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, uronic acid accumulation, and alginate-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The algC promoter was shown to have maximum activity in planktonic cultures during the late lag and early <b>log</b> <b>phases</b> of the cell growth cycle.
