5|$|A {{radio galaxy}} {{is an active}} galaxy that is very <b>luminous</b> in the radio portion of the spectrum, and is {{emitting}} immense plumes or lobes of gas. Active galaxies that emit shorter frequency, high-energy radiation include Seyfert galaxies, Quasars, and Blazars. Quasars {{are believed to be}} the most consistently <b>luminous</b> objects in the known universe.|$|E
5|$|Prior to its {{rebranding}} {{and full}} move onto eighth-generation consoles, Final Fantasy XV (then called Final Fantasy Versus XIII) used lighting technology from <b>Luminous</b> {{along with a}} purpose-built proprietary gameplay engine. For its E3 2013 re-reveal under its new title, the company used a specially-created engine environment named Ebony. In July 2014, Hashimoto left the company, citing personal reasons. While still working as an advisor for <b>Luminous</b> Studio, his position as project leader was filled by Remi Driancourt, a senior engineer {{who had worked with}} games featuring <b>Luminous</b> technology. The version of XV shown off at Tokyo Game Show and Jump Festa that year ran on <b>Luminous</b> 1.4, which combined <b>Luminous</b> with components created for Ebony. The Episode Duscae game demo ran on version 1.5, and the developers plan for the final game to run on version 2.0.|$|E

5|$|The Sun has an {{apparent}} magnitude of −26.7, but its absolute magnitude is only +4.83. Sirius, {{the brightest star}} in the night sky as seen from Earth, is approximately 23 times more <b>luminous</b> than the Sun, while Canopus, the second brightest star in the night sky with an absolute magnitude of −5.53, is approximately 14,000 times more <b>luminous</b> than the Sun. Despite Canopus being vastly more <b>luminous</b> than Sirius, however, Sirius appears brighter than Canopus. This is because Sirius is merely 8.6 light-years from the Earth, while Canopus is much farther away at a distance of 310 light-years.|$|E
5|$|As an A-type main {{sequence}} star, Beta Pictoris is more <b>luminous</b> than the Sun: combining the apparent magnitude of 3.861 with {{the distance of}} 19.44 parsecs gives an absolute magnitude of 2.42, {{as compared to the}} Sun, which has an absolute magnitude of 4.83. This corresponds to a visual luminosity 9.2 times greater than that of the Sun. When the entire spectrum of radiation from Beta Pictoris and the Sun is taken into account, Beta Pictoris is found to be 8.7 times more <b>luminous</b> than the Sun.|$|E
5|$|As of 2006, {{the star}} {{with the highest}} known {{absolute}} magnitude is LBV 1806-20, with a magnitude of −14.2. This star is at least 5,000,000 times more <b>luminous</b> than the Sun. The least <b>luminous</b> stars that are currently known {{are located in the}} NGC 6397 cluster. The faintest red dwarfs in the cluster were magnitude 26, while a 28th magnitude white dwarf was also discovered. These faint stars are so dim that their light is as bright as a birthday candle on the Moon when viewed from the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Component F is {{also known}} as TYC 3358-3142-1. It is listed with a {{spectral}} type of K although it is included in a catalogue of OB stars as a distant <b>luminous</b> star.|$|E

5|$|Proposed definition: The candela, symbol cd, is the SI unit of <b>luminous</b> {{intensity}} {{in a given}} direction. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the <b>luminous</b> efficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency , Kcd, to be 683 when expressed in the unit lm⋅W−1, which is equal to cd⋅sr⋅W−1, or cd⋅sr⋅kg−1⋅m−2⋅s3, where the kilogram, metre and second are {{defined in terms of}} h, c and ΔνCs.|$|E
5|$|The head of {{the project}} was Yoshihisa Hashimoto, Square Enix's Chief Technology Officer, who had moved over to the company from Sonic Team in 2009 and became {{involved}} with development in 2011. Other key Square Enix staff members working on <b>Luminous</b> Studio include Takeshi Nozue, Akira Iwata and Hiroshi Iwasaki. While ground work was being laid for <b>Luminous,</b> members of the team traveled to look at engine technology being developed by IO Interactive, Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montréal, western video game developers who became subsidiaries after the company bought out Eidos Interactive. Square Enix's western subsidiaries shared information about game engine development from their experience developing the CDC and Glacier 2 game engines and shared their source code with the <b>Luminous</b> Studio team. During 2012, one third of the final development team was from western subsidiaries of the company. <b>Luminous</b> was developed based on high-end DirectX 11 technology. While designed for eighth-generation video games, it was said to also be compatible with any console and hardware that could handle shaders, such as PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Its compatibility with Nintendo's seventh-gen hardware such as the Wii and Nintendo 3DS was doubted, as those consoles did not support shaders. During this early stage, they were looking into the possibility of adjusting the engine for use on Wii U. The company were hoping to promote <b>Luminous</b> as a kind of brand, showing off the logo and tech demo when they were ready.|$|E
5|$|The secondary, 55 Cancri B, is a {{red dwarf}} star much less massive and <b>luminous</b> than the Sun. There are {{indications}} that component B may itself be a double star, though this is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|A star is a <b>luminous</b> {{sphere of}} plasma held {{together}} by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are {{visible to the naked}} eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed <b>luminous</b> points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are in{{visible to the naked eye}} from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.|$|E
5|$|A star remains {{near its}} initial {{position}} on the main sequence until {{a significant amount of}} hydrogen in the core has been consumed, then begins to evolve into a more <b>luminous</b> star. (On the HR diagram, the evolving star moves up and {{to the right of the}} main sequence.) Thus the main sequence represents the primary hydrogen-burning stage of a star's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Although we {{are used}} to {{thinking}} of supernovae primarily as <b>luminous</b> visible events, the electromagnetic radiation they release is almost a minor side-effect. Particularly in the case of core collapse supernovae, the emitted electromagnetic radiation is {{a tiny fraction of the}} total energy released during the event.|$|E
5|$|First {{observed}} in September 2006, the supernova SN 2006gy, which {{occurred in a}} galaxy called NGC 1260 (240 million light-years away), is the largest and, until confirmation of luminosity of SN 2005ap in October 2007, the most <b>luminous</b> supernova ever observed. The explosion was at least 100 times more <b>luminous</b> than any previously observed supernova, with the progenitor star being estimated 150 times more massive than the Sun. Although this had some characteristics of a Type Ia supernova, Hydrogen {{was found in the}} spectrum. It is thought that SN 2006gy is a likely candidate for a pair-instability supernova. SN 2005ap, which was discovered by Robert Quimby who also discovered SN 2006gy, was about twice as bright as SN 2006gy and about 300 times as bright as a normal type II supernova.|$|E
5|$|Hydroxyl megamasers {{occur in}} the nuclear regions of LIRGs, and {{appear to be a}} marker in the stage of the {{formation}} of galaxies. As hydroxyl emission is not subject to extinction by interstellar dust in its host LIRG, hydroxyl masers may be useful probes of the conditions where star formation in LIRGs takes place. At redshifts of z ~ 2, there are LIRG-like galaxies more <b>luminous</b> than the ones in the nearby universe. The observed relationship between the hydroxyl luminosity and far infrared luminosity suggests that hydroxyl megamasers in such galaxies may be tens to hundreds of times more <b>luminous</b> than observed hydroxyl megamasers. Detection of hydroxyl megamasers in such galaxies would allow precise determination of the redshift, and aid understanding of star formation in these objects.|$|E
5|$|IK Pegasi (or HR 8210) is {{a binary}} star {{system in the}} {{constellation}} Pegasus. It is just <b>luminous</b> enough {{to be seen with}} the unaided eye, at a distance of about 150 light years from the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 an Austrian chemist Auer von Welsbach {{developed}} the Oslamp with a filament made of osmium, which he introduced commercially in 1902. After {{only a few}} years, osmium {{was replaced by the}} more stable metal tungsten. Tungsten has the highest melting point among all metals, and its use in light bulbs increases the <b>luminous</b> efficacy and life of incandescent lamps.|$|E
5|$|Krypton's {{multiple}} emission lines make ionized krypton gas discharges appear whitish, {{which in}} turn makes krypton-based bulbs useful in photography as a brilliant white light source. Krypton is used in some photographic flashes for high speed photography. Krypton gas is also combined with other gases to make <b>luminous</b> signs that glow with a bright greenish-yellow light.|$|E
5|$|<b>Luminous</b> {{infrared}} galaxies or LIRGs are galaxies with luminosities, {{the measurement}} of brightness, above 1011 L☉. LIRGs are more abundant than starburst galaxies, Seyfert galaxies and quasi-stellar objects at comparable total luminosity. Infrared galaxies emit more energy in the infrared than at all other wavelengths combined. A LIRG's luminosity is 100 billion times that of our Sun.|$|E
5|$|Short (time duration) GRBs {{appear to}} come from a lower-redshift (i.e. less distant) {{population}} and are less <b>luminous</b> than long GRBs. The degree of beaming in short bursts has not been accurately measured, but as a population they are likely less collimated than long GRBs or possibly not collimated at all in some cases.|$|E
5|$|The Sm ion is a {{potential}} activator for use in warm-white light emitting diodes. It offers high <b>luminous</b> efficacy due to the narrow emission bands, however, the generally low quantum efficiency and insufficient absorption in the UV-A to blue spectral region hinders commercial application.|$|E
5|$|The Sun is a G2-type main-sequence star. Hotter main-sequence {{stars are}} more <b>luminous.</b> The Sun's {{temperature}} is intermediate between {{that of the}} hottest stars {{and that of the}} coolest stars. Stars brighter and hotter than the Sun are rare, whereas substantially dimmer and cooler stars, known as red dwarfs, make up 85% of the stars in the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|The most <b>luminous</b> {{supernova}} {{ever recorded}} is ASASSN-15lh. It was first detected in June 2015 and peaked at , which is twice the bolometric luminosity {{of any other}} known supernova. However, {{the nature of this}} supernova continues to be debated and several alternative explanations have been suggested. e.g. the tidal disruption of a star by a black hole.|$|E
5|$|The {{pigments}} {{available to}} painters were more varied; monks in monasteries used verdigris, made by soaking copper in fermenting wine, to color medieval manuscripts. They also used finely-ground malachite, which made a <b>luminous</b> green. They used green earth colors for backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} this process has been a steady {{increase}} in the energy output of the Sun. When the Sun first became a main sequence star, it radiated only 70% of the current luminosity. The luminosity has increased in a nearly linear fashion to the present, rising by 1% every 110 million years. Likewise, in three billion years the Sun {{is expected to be}} 33% more <b>luminous.</b> The hydrogen fuel at the core will finally be exhausted in five billion years, when the Sun will be 67% more <b>luminous</b> than at present. Thereafter the Sun will continue to burn hydrogen in a shell surrounding its core, until the luminosity reaches 121% above the present value. This marks the end of the Sun's main sequence lifetime, and thereafter it will pass through the subgiant stage and evolve into a red giant.|$|E
5|$|There {{was hardly}} a design element on the ceiling that was not {{subsequently}} imitated: the fictive architecture, the muscular anatomy, the foreshortening, the dynamic motion, the <b>luminous</b> colouration, the haunting expressions of the figures in the lunettes, the abundance of putti.|$|E
5|$|Ytterbium metal tarnishes {{slowly in}} air. Finely {{dispersed}} ytterbium readily oxidizes in air and under oxygen. Mixtures of powdered ytterbium with polytetrafluoroethylene or hexachloroethane burn with a <b>luminous</b> emerald-green flame. Ytterbium reacts with hydrogen to form various non-stoichiometric hydrides. Ytterbium dissolves slowly in water, but quickly in acids, liberating hydrogen gas.|$|E
5|$|According to Julien Merceron, the Worldwide Technology Director for Square Enix in {{the early}} 2010s, the concept for the new engine was born in 2011 {{while he was in}} the final stages of working on Final Fantasy XIII-2. This was a {{difficult}} period for Square Enix: the project then known as Final Fantasy Versus XIII was hitting technical barriers as it transitioned to open world environments its original Crystal Tools engine could not handle, and Final Fantasy XIV had met with a disastrous launch due to development and technical problems. Faced with these issues, Square Enix decided to bring in former developers from Sega to create new engines for their products, including <b>Luminous</b> Studio. Talking about sharing the engine, Merceron said that he advised the company to avoid sharing between companies or internally between games until the engine had been finalized with the released game: this resulted in <b>Luminous</b> Studio being restricted to what would become Final Fantasy XV during development, while other major next-generation titles would use other outsourced engines.|$|E
5|$|Another {{model for}} the {{formation}} of Type Ia supernovae involves the merger of two white dwarf stars, with the combined mass momentarily exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit. There is much variation in this type of event, and in many cases there may be no supernova at all, but it is expected that they will have a broader and less <b>luminous</b> light curve than the more normal SN Type Ia.|$|E
5|$|As a red dwarf, Gliese 876 is {{much less}} massive than the Sun: {{estimates}} suggest it has only 32% {{of the mass of}} the Sun. The surface temperature of Gliese 876 is cooler than the Sun and the star has a smaller radius. These factors combine to make the star only 1.24% as <b>luminous</b> as the Sun, and most of this is at infrared wavelengths.|$|E
5|$|Asteroseismic {{analysis}} of the star reveals it is approximately 10% more massive than the Sun and significantly older, at around 6.34 billion years. The radius of the star is 36% {{greater than that of}} the Sun and it is 90% more <b>luminous.</b> The star contains twice the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen of the Sun and is therefore described as metal-rich. Mu Arae is also more enriched than the Sun in the element helium.|$|E
5|$|Astronomically, {{the most}} {{important}} property of compact objects is that they provide a supremely efficient mechanism for converting gravitational energy into electromagnetic radiation. Accretion, the falling of dust or gaseous matter onto stellar or supermassive black holes, {{is thought to be}} responsible for some spectacularly <b>luminous</b> astronomical objects, notably diverse kinds of active galactic nuclei on galactic scales and stellar-size objects such as microquasars. In particular, accretion can lead to relativistic jets, focused beams of highly energetic particles that are being flung into space at almost light speed.|$|E
5|$|During {{a sabbatical}} year at Princeton University in 1960, Christy began an {{investigation}} of Cepheid variables and the smaller RR Lyrae variables, classes of <b>luminous</b> variable stars. At {{the time it was}} a mystery as to why they varied. He used the knowledge of the hydrodynamics of implosion gained at Los Alamos during the war to explain this phenomenon. This earned him the Royal Astronomical Society's Eddington Medal for contributions to theoretical astrophysics in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Eta Apodis {{is a white}} main {{sequence}} star located 138 ± 1 light-years distant. Of apparent magnitude 4.89, it is 1.77 times as massive, 15.5 times as <b>luminous</b> as the Sun and has 2.13 times its radius. Aged 250 ± 200 million years old, this star is emitting an excess of 24μm infrared radiation, which {{may be caused by}} a debris disk of dust orbiting at a distance of more than 31 astronomical units from it.|$|E
