5|$|In 2012, Winnipeg {{was ranked}} by KPMG as the <b>least</b> <b>expensive</b> {{location}} {{to do business}} in western Canada. Like many prairie cities, Winnipeg has a relatively low cost of living. According to the Canadian Real Estate Association, the average house price in Winnipeg was $260,000 as of 2013. As of May 2014, the Consumer Price Index was 125.8 relative to 2002 prices, reflecting consumer costs at the Canadian average.|$|E
40|$|The <b>least</b> {{computational}} <b>expensive</b> Hamiltonian (methods) and wavefunction (basis sets) for diatomic nickel-aluminum (NiAl), was calculated, {{along with}} the ground state, bond length, frequency, and binding energy. Researchers believe nickel-aluminum {{can be used in}} high performance turbine jet engines, in place of aluminum-coated nickel. The effects of basis functions under increasing levels of theory were compared to methods under increasing levels of theory. The free energy at two possible ground states, doublet or quartet, of nickel-aluminum was compared. The results consistently show the ground-state of nickel-aluminum is the doublet, and therefore has a bond between two valence electrons, one from each nickel and aluminum, and one unpaired electron. The data converged when using large number of basis sets, but did not produce precise results when compared with different methods. Results suggest the density-functional theory (DFT) and an augmented correlation consistent basis set are needed, at minimum, to properly optimize nickel-aluminum. The <b>least</b> computationally <b>expensive,</b> most precise basis set/method combination for diatomic NiAl allows for further research in the <b>least</b> computationally <b>expensive</b> combination, of method and basis set, for large microclusters of NiAl, which could be used in engines as well...|$|R
30|$|For example, {{the direct}} air capture of CO 2 is {{considered}} to have great potential for atmospheric CO 2 reduction. Although technology exists, {{it is not clear}} whether it can be operated on an industrial scale because the cost estimate is very uncertain, but it is at <b>least</b> as <b>expensive</b> as conventional mitigation.|$|R
25|$|There is no sewer tariff in Kenya, so that {{properties}} {{connected to}} the sewer network receive this service for free, although sewerage and wastewater treatment is at <b>least</b> as <b>expensive</b> as drinking water supply.

5|$|A {{light rail}} system for Greater Manchester emerged from {{the failure of the}} 1970s Picc-Vic tunnel scheme to obtain central {{government}} funding. A light-rail scheme was proposed in 1982 as the <b>least</b> <b>expensive</b> rail-based transport solution for Manchester city centre and the surrounding Greater Manchester metropolitan area. Government approval was granted in 1988 and the network began operating services between Bury Interchange and Victoria on 6 April 1992, becoming the United Kingdom's first modern street-running rail system; the 1885-built Blackpool tramway being the only first-generation tram system in the UK that had survived up to Metrolink's creation.|$|E

In Amsterdam, on Christmas Day, Abdulmutallab checked in for Northwest Airlines Flight 253 to Detroit with only carry-on luggage. On March24, 2011, the Associated Press {{reported}} that Abdulmutallab chose to attack Detroit because the plane ticket {{there was the}} <b>least</b> <b>expensive</b> of tickets to potential US targets, which included Chicago and Houston. Initially, some media rumored that Abdulmutallab tried to fly to Detroit {{because it was a}} major hub of the U.S. automotive industry.|$|E
5|$|Both clubs {{received}} an allocation of approximately 31,000 tickets. Cardiff fans would be {{housed in the}} East End of the stadium, while Liverpool fans were allocated the West End of the stadium. Ticket prices were increased from last year's final, with the most expensive tickets costing £90 up £4 from the previous year. The <b>least</b> <b>expensive</b> tickets cost £40, which was £2 more than last year. It was decided that before the match started national anthems would not be played. This {{decision was made to}} avoid spectators jeering the anthems, as happened during the 2008 FA Cup Final between Portsmouth and Cardiff.|$|E

50|$|A {{practical}} {{problem with}} regard to contacting families is that the original person who organised a burial may themselves also be dead and buried and locating living family members many decades later is virtually impossible (or at <b>least</b> prohibitively <b>expensive).</b> Therefore, communication about re-use in local cemeteries tends to occur only through in local publications, which often do not reach family members living further afield who may only {{become aware of the}} re-use of the grave after the event (and after the removal and destruction of monuments and headstones).|$|R

5|$|Frequently used topical retinoids include adapalene, isotretinoin, retinol, tazarotene, and tretinoin. They often {{cause an}} initial {{flare-up}} of acne and facial flushing, {{and can cause}} significant skin irritation. Generally speaking, retinoids increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight and are therefore recommended for use at night. Tretinoin is the <b>least</b> <b>expensive</b> of the topical retinoids and is the most irritating to the skin, whereas adapalene is the least irritating to the skin but costs significantly more. Tazarotene {{is the most effective}} and expensive topical retinoid, but is not as well-tolerated. Retinol is a form of vitamin A that has similar but milder effects, and is used in many over-the-counter moisturizers and other topical products.|$|E
5|$|With the {{formation}} of WMATA in October 1966, planning of the system shifted from federal hands to a regional body {{with representatives of the}} District, Maryland and Virginia. Congressional route approval was no longer a key consideration. Instead, routes had to serve each local suburban jurisdiction to assure that they would approve bond referenda to finance the system. Because the <b>least</b> <b>expensive</b> way to build into the suburbs was to rely upon existing railroad right-of-ways, the Orange Line took much of its present form, except that it also featured a further extension along the railroad to Bowie, Maryland and along the Dulles Access Road to the Dulles Airport.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 19,499,337 gold dollars were coined, of which 18,223,438 were struck at Philadelphia, 1,004,000 at New Orleans, 109,138 at Charlotte, 90,232 at San Francisco and 72,529 at Dahlonega. According to an {{advertisement}} in the February 1899 issue of The Numismatist, gold dollars brought $1.80 each, still in demand as {{a birthday present}} and for jewelry. That journal in 1905 carried news of a customer depositing 100 gold dollars into a bank; the teller, aware of the value, credited the account with $1.60 per coin. In 1908, a dealer offered $2 each for any quantity. As coin collecting became a widespread pastime in the early 20th century, gold dollars became a popular specialty, a status they retain. The 2014 edition of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins rates the <b>least</b> <b>expensive</b> gold dollar in very fine condition (VF-20) at $300, a value given {{for each of the}} Type 1 Philadelphia issues from 1849 to 1853. Those seeking one of each type will find the most expensive to be a specimen of the Type 2, with the 1854 and 1855 estimated at $350 in that condition; the other two types have dates valued at $300 in that grade.|$|E
5000|$|Before 1674, land {{surveyors}} for New Jersey considered it as {{a hundred and}} partitioned it into Tenths. West Jersey comprised five of the tenths. But demarcation of the boundaries awaited settlement, the quit-rents the settlers would pay, and the land surveying the money would purchase. Thus it took years and multiple surveys to settle boundary disputes. Burlington County was formed on 17 May 1694 by combining [...] "the first and second Tenths." [...] But at <b>least</b> three <b>expensive</b> surveys occurred to define just its northern extent. Richard Tindall was surveyor-general of Fenwick's Colony, the fifth Tenth.|$|R
50|$|Some indices display market {{variations}} that {{cannot be}} captured in other ways. For example, the Economist provides a Big Mac Index that expresses the adjusted {{cost of a}} globally ubiquitous Big Mac as a percentage over or under {{the cost of a}} Big Mac in the U.S. in USD (estimated: $3.57). The <b>least</b> relatively <b>expensive</b> Big Mac price occurs in Hong Kong, at a 52% reduction from U.S. prices, or $1.71 U.S. Such indices can be used to help forecast currency values. From this example, it would be assumed that Hong Kong currency is undervalued, and provides a currency investment opportunity.|$|R

[...] By these standards, California has the nation's most <b>expensive,</b> <b>least</b> effective juvenile justice system.|$|R
5|$|Derfflinger was {{constructed}} at Blohm & Voss in Hamburg under construction number 213. She was the <b>least</b> <b>expensive</b> {{of the three}} ships, {{at a cost of}} 56 million gold marks. The ship was ready to be launched on 14 June 1913, but during the ceremony, one of the wooden sledges upon which the hull rested became jammed. It took until 12 July for her to enter the water. She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 1 September 1914, shortly after the outbreak of World War I. Lützow was built at the Schichau dockyard in Danzig under construction number 885, at the cost of 58million gold marks. The ship was launched on 29 November 1913, and after lengthy trials, commissioned on 8 August 1915. Hindenburg, the final member of the class, was built at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven, under construction number 34. The ship was built at a cost of 59million gold marks, the most expensive of the three vessels. She was launched on 1 August 1915 and commissioned on 10 May 1917.|$|E
5|$|Finally, in May 1957, bids {{opened for}} the part of US 80 between Grossmont Boulevard in La Mesa and Chase Avenue in El Cajon, that would connect to the new SR 67 freeway. Groundbreaking took place on June 10, and the project was to cost $3.6 million. The {{rebuilding}} of the Cabrillo Freeway interchange became a priority due to the availability of federal funding, and due to the traffic problems encountered with having ramps entering from {{both the left and}} the right. In July, the Highway Development Association decided to formally raise the issue of the incomplete highway survey through Imperial County at the next California Highway Commission meeting. In 1958, federal funds were allocated to construct US 80 from Taylor Street to Fairmount Avenue as an eight-lane freeway, and from there to 70th Street as a divided highway. In August, the state announced that there were four proposed routes for US 80 through the mountains, including one with a tunnel. A contract was later awarded to construct the freeway from Taylor Street to the Cabrillo Freeway at a cost of $1.2 million. In November, Caltrans announced that the Walker Canyon route had been chosen for US 80, which would allow for the route to be constructed in stages, as well as being the <b>least</b> <b>expensive</b> alternative.|$|E
5|$|The 1986 SQL {{standard}} basically adopted Codd's proposal {{after an}} implementation prototype in IBM System R. Although Don Chamberlin recognized nulls (alongside duplicate rows) {{as one of}} the most controversial features of SQL, he defended the design of Nulls in SQL invoking the pragmatic arguments that it was the <b>least</b> <b>expensive</b> form of system support for missing information, saving the programmer from many duplicative application-level checks (see semipredicate problem) while at the same time providing the database designer with the option not to use Nulls if he so desires; for example, in order to avoid well known anomalies (discussed in the semantics section of this article). Chamberlin also argued that besides providing some missing-value functionality, practical experience with Nulls also led to other language features which rely on Nulls, like certain grouping constructs and outer joins. Finally, he argued that in practice Nulls also end up being used as a quick way to patch an existing schema when it needs to evolve beyond its original intent, coding not for missing but rather for inapplicable information; for example, a database that quickly needs to support electric cars while having a miles-per-gallon column.|$|E

40|$|Density {{functional}} theory generalized gradient approximation calculations, {{which were}} tested in our previous detailed study of [RhCl(PF 3) 2] 2 (Seuret et al., 2003, Phys. Chem. chem. Phys., 5, 268 - 274), were applied {{for a series of}} homologous organometallic compounds of the [RhXL 2] 2 (X = Cl, Br, or I; L = CO, PH 3, or PF 3) type. Various properties of the studied compounds were obtained. Optimized geometries of [RhCl(PH 3) 2] 2 and [RhCl(CO) 2] 2 are in very good agreement with available experimental data. Geometries of other compounds as well as other properties (thermochemistry of selected fragmentation channels, barriers to structural changes, frontier orbitals) which are not available experimentally were predicted. All the considered compounds are not planar. Enforcing planarity of the central [RhX] 2 moiety requires only a small energetic cost ranging from 2. 2 to 3. 9 kcal mol- 1. The analysis of frontier orbitals indicates that the metals provide the most favourable site for the electrophilic attack in all considered compounds. The analysis of the shape of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals indicates that the halogens and ligands provide the most favourable site for the nucleophilic attack for [RhCl(CO) 2] 2 or [RhCl(PF 3) 2]. For [RhBr(PF 3) 2] 2, [RhI(PF 3) 2] 2 and [RhCl(PH 3) 2] 2, the nucleophilic attack on the halogen is less probable. Except for [RhCl(CO) 2] 2, the <b>least</b> energetically <b>expensive</b> decomposition channel involves initial separation of ligands. For [RhCl(CO) 2] 2, its decomposition into the RhCl(CO) 2 fragments was found to be the <b>least</b> energetically <b>expensive</b> fragmentation reaction which {{is probably one of the}} reasons for the known catalytic activity of this compound...|$|R
40|$|Prior to 1997, homeowners under 55 {{were allowed}} to defer capital gains taxes from a home sale if they bought another house at <b>least</b> as <b>expensive,</b> while those over 55 {{received}} a capital gains exclusion regardless {{of the cost of}} their new home. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (TRA 97) eliminated this differential tax treatment. We exploit the differential treatment before 1997 to uncover TRA 97 ’s effects. Comparing homeowners under 55 before and after 1997, we find that those who moved after 1997 are twice as likely as to list “seeking less expensive housing” as a reason for moving, 8 percent less likely to own their residences and 9 percent less likely to live in a single family home. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a modification to {{the calculation of}} the two-point correlation function commonly used {{in the analysis of}} large scale structure in cosmology. An estimator of the two-point correlation function is constructed by contrasting the observed distribution of galaxies with that of a uniformly populated random catalog. Using the assumption that the distribution of random galaxies in redshift is independent of angular position allows us to replace pairwise combinatorics with fast integration over probability maps. The new method significantly reduces the computation time while simultaneously increasing the precision of the calculation. It also allows to introduce cosmological parameters only at the last and <b>least</b> computationally <b>expensive</b> stage, which is helpful when exploring various choices for these parameters.

40|$|The {{response}} {{and stability of}} a flexible rod, rigid crank quick return mechanism is investigated without a small crank restriction. A Galerkin's approach {{was found to be}} too computationally intensive, due to the moving boundary and complex mode shapes, and thus unsuitable for monodromy based parametric resonance stability investigations. A simple set of polynomial modes were developed. Although requiring more modes than the Galerkin method to obtain the same accuracy, polynomial modes require less computation time for stability investigations. A free-free (time independent) mode method was used to obtain non-linear dynamical and constraint equations. The method was found to be the most accurate and <b>least</b> computationally <b>expensive</b> for response; however, these equations were non-linear and not suitable for stability investigations...|$|R
