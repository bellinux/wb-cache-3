5000|$|The {{concept of}} biocontainment {{is related to}} <b>laboratory</b> <b>biosafety</b> and {{pertains}} to microbiology laboratories in which the physical containment of highly pathogenic organisms or agents (bacteria, viruses, and toxins) is required, usually by isolation in environmentally and biologically secure cabinets or rooms, to prevent accidental infection of workers or release into the surrounding community during scientific research. The term [...] "biocontainment" [...] was coined in 1985, but the concept stretches {{back at least to}} the 1940s.|$|E
50|$|Isolation {{is defined}} as the {{voluntary}} or compulsory separation and confinement of those known or suspected to be infected with a contagious disease agent (whether ill or not) to prevent further infections. (In this form of isolation, transmission-based precautions are imposed.) In contrast, quarantine is the compulsory separation and confinement, with restriction of movement, of healthy individuals or groups who have potentially been exposed to an agent to prevent further infections should infection occur. Biocontainment refers to <b>laboratory</b> <b>biosafety</b> in microbiology laboratories in which the physical containment (BSL-3, BSL-4) of highly pathogenic organisms is accomplished through built-in engineering controls.|$|E

40|$|Background: This study {{determined}} {{current status}} of <b>laboratory</b> <b>biosafety</b> in Nigerian veterinary research facilities. Methods: A questionnaire was developed to obtain information from researchers across Nigeria from July 2014 to July 2015. Information regarding demographics, knowledge of <b>laboratory</b> <b>biosafety,</b> availability and proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE), any priority pathogens researched, attitude on and use of standard laboratory practices, and biosafety awareness was obtained using a numeric scoring system. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: A total of 74 participants from 19 facilities completed the questionnaire. General knowledge scores ranged from 3 to 28 (out of 28 possible points), with 94. 6 % of respondents receiving low scores (scores   mean +  1 standard deviation). Only 16. 2 % of respondents (from four facilities) reported having biosafety officers. Rabies virus was the most researched pathogen (31. 1 % of respondents). The majority (71. 6 %) were unaware of laws guiding biosafety. Researchers [odds ratio (OR)  =  18. 0; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 63, 198. 5; p =  0. 023], especially in BSL- 2 (OR =  258. 5; 95 % CI: 12. 71, 5256; p <  0. 001) facility of research institute (OR =  25. 0; 95 % CI: 5. 18, 120. 6; p <  0. 001), {{are more likely to}} have adequate access to and properly utilize biosafety devices and PPE.

40|$|Objectives: As {{the demand}} {{to deal with}} {{pathogens}} in domestic research institutions has expanded and biological accidents have increased, the need for systematic biosafety management in infectious disease laboratories has grown. According to international standards, risk assessment (RA) is required for biosafety management. However, RA criteria have not been clearly established in Korea, so to this end I have attempted to determine RA criteria meeting international levels Methods: In order to provide RA criteria for application, I analyzed the RA criteria in use in the U. S., Europe and at international organizations. In order to ensure the public nature of the RA criteria, I constructed the research model through modified management consulting methodology reflecting the model of Radnor and O'Mahoney. Results: According {{to the results of}} the study, existing <b>laboratory</b> <b>biosafety</b> regulations were comparable to domestic laboratory safety laws. Existing <b>laboratory</b> <b>biosafety</b> standards that are designed around risk factors were found to be insufficient.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe aim of {{this study}} was to assess public and private medical {{diagnostic}} laboratories in Nigeria for the presence of biosafety equipment, devices, and measures. MethodsA total of 80 diagnostic <b>laboratories</b> in <b>biosafety</b> level 3 were assessed for the presence of biosafety equipment, devices, and compliance rate with biosafety practices. A detailed questionnaire and checklist was used to obtain the relevant information from enlisted laboratories. ResultsThe results showed the presence of an isolated unit for microbiological work, leak-proof working benches, self-closing doors, emergency exits, fire extinguisher(s), autoclaves, and hand washing sinks in 21. 3 %, 71. 3 %, 15. 0 %, 1. 3 %, 11. 3 %, 82. 5 %, and 67. 5 %, respectively, of all laboratories surveyed. It was observed that public diagnostic laboratories were significantly more likely to have an isolated unit for microbiological work (p =  0. 001), hand washing sink (p =  0. 003), and an autoclave (p ≤  0. 001) than private ones. Routine use of hand gloves, biosafety cabinet, and a first aid box was observed in 35. 0 %, 20. 0 %, and 2. 5 %, respectively, of all laboratories examined. Written standard operating procedures, biosafety manuals, and biohazard signs on door entrances were observed in 6. 3 %, 1. 3 %, and 3. 8 %, respectively, of all audited <b>laboratories.</b> No <b>biosafety</b> officer(s) or records of previous spills, or injuries and accidents, were observed in all diagnostic laboratories studied.
