40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Critical Heat Flux (CHF) is an {{important}} safety parameter {{for the design of}} nuclear reactors. The most commonly used predictive tool for determination of CHF is a <b>look-up</b> <b>table</b> developed using tube data with an average hydraulic test diameter of 8 mm. There exist in the world today nuclear reactors whose geometry is annular, not tubular, and whose hydraulic diameter is significantly smaller than 8 mm. In addition, any sub-channel thermal hydraulic model of fuel assemblies is annular and not tubular. Comparisons were made between this predictive tool and annular correlations developed from test data. These comparisons showed the <b>look-up</b> <b>table</b> over-predicts the CHF values for annular channels, thus questioning its ability to perform correct safety evaluations. Since no better tool exists to predict CHF for annular geometry, an effort was undertaken to produce one. A database of open literature annular CHF values was created as a basis for this new tool. By compiling information from eighteen sources and requiring that the data be inner wall, unilaterally, uniformly heated with no spacers or heat transfer enhancement devices, a database of 1630 experimental values was produced. After a review of the data in the database, a new <b>look-up</b> <b>table</b> was created. A <b>look-up</b> <b>table</b> provides localized control of the prediction to overcome sparseness of data. Using Shepard's Method as the extrapolation technique, a regular mesh <b>look-up</b> <b>table</b> was produced using four main variables: pressure, quality, mass flux, and hydraulic diameter. The root mean square error of this <b>look-up</b> <b>table</b> was found to be 0. 8267. However, by fixing the hydraulic diameter locations to the database values, the root mean square error was further reduced to 0. 2816. This <b>look-up</b> <b>table</b> can now predict CHF values for annular channels over a wide range of fluid conditions...|$|R

40|$|In {{this report}} we are {{presenting}} two decoding algorithms for binary variable-length codes, {{based on a}} <b>look-up</b> <b>table</b> approach. This type of algorithms are familiar to software designers, but the authors {{have not been able}} to find any scientific material, where the decoding speed is analysed. The algorithms will decode one or several source symbols for each cycle of the algorithm. The <b>look-up</b> <b>table</b> approach is based on a completion of the tree representation of the variable-length code. Decoding is done by indexing a table with a fixed-length block from the concatenated variable-length code sequence. One restriction is that the fixed-length block must be at least as long as the maximal code word length in the used variable-length code. Both the speed and memory requirement properties of the algorithms are studied. It is shown that the <b>look-up</b> <b>table</b> algorithms are considerably faster than the tree-search algorithm, seen in most tutorial books, at a cost of memory requirements exponentially growing with the fixed-length block size. On the one hand, the memory requirements of the <b>look-up</b> <b>table</b> decoders are large, but on the other hand the cost per bit of memory has shown a rapidly decreasing trend during the last few decades. Dedicated hardware proposals are presented for the <b>look-up</b> <b>table</b> algorithms, as well as a software evaluation of the decompression speeds on an i 486 PC, using a 32 -bit C compiler...|$|R
