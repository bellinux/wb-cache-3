25|$|In the Mediterranean basin the Crusades greatly enriched both rival {{republics of}} Venice and Genoa. To supply the {{troops of the}} rich Frankish lords these republics {{provided}} them with wine from Greece. The port of Monemvasia, which exported a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>white</b> wine, gave {{its name to the}} variety Malvasia. The Crusaders also discovered Muscat wine. Once back home, the rulers and wealthy aristocrats looking to buy the sweet wines they enjoyed in the East. They came from grapes that dominated the vineyards of Languedoc-Roussillon and Spain. Trade in these wines was facilitated by their high alcohol content which ensured preservation during the long journey to Northern Europe.|$|E
25|$|Other {{properties}} of a color, {{such as its}} saturation or lightness, may {{be determined by the}} other substances that accompany pigments. Binders and fillers added to pure pigment chemicals also have their own reflection and absorption patterns, which can affect the final spectrum. Likewise, in pigment/binder mixtures, individual rays of light may not encounter pigment molecules, and may be reflected as is. These stray rays of source light contribute to a slightly less saturated color. Pure pigment allows very little white light to escape, producing a highly saturated color. A small quantity of pigment mixed with a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>white</b> binder, however, will appear desaturated and pale, due to the high quantity of escaping white light.|$|E

25|$|In Europe, German {{vineyards}} {{are predominantly}} white (63.1% of production area in 2006), {{as are the}} Swiss vineyards (more than 50% of the area in production are white grapes) and the Luxembourg vineyards (93% of the production area in white or grey grapes or gray). In France the northern half produces most of the white wines (Alsace, Jura, Champagne, and the Loire Valley). In Spain, paradoxically, Castile-La Mancha accounts for 50% of the Spanish vineyards, producing mostly white wine on a very large production area in a high temperature zone. The Catalonia region produces a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>white</b> grapes which are transformed into Sparkling wine called Cava.

500|$|Another interviewee, François, {{a middle-aged}} woodcutter who {{spent time in}} the forests inland (east) from the main road between Morondava and Belo sur Mer, and five of his friends, {{reported}} seeing kidoky recently. [...] Their description of the animal and François's imitation of its long call were virtually identical to Pascou's. [...] One {{of the young men}} insisted that its fur had a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>white</b> in it, but the other men could not confirm that. François and his friends reported that it had never climbed a tree in their presence, and that it flees on the ground in short leaps or bounds. [...] When Burney imitated the sideways leaping of a sifaka moving on the ground, one of the men corrected him, pointing out that he was imitating a sifaka. [...] The man's imitation of the gallop kidoky used was very baboon-like. The men also reported that imitating its call can draw the animal closer and cause it to continue calling.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} few days 452 re-equipped with Spitfire VBs which had two Hispano-Suiza HS.404 calibre cannon in each wing to {{supplement}} four 7.7mm (0.303in) Browning machine guns. Finucane hand-picked AB852 because it had the code W adorned on the fuselage. The Spitfire that Finucane damaged in the collision with Dutton earlier also had this letter. Superstition compelled him to fly with a W-decorated fighter for good luck. On Saturday 16 August 1941 Finucane celebrated his greatest success in this machine. Circus 73 began at 07:25, and once again the wing was sent to Saint Omer. Near Gravelines eight to ten Bf 109s engaged 485 squadron. At the customary 100 yards a two-second burst—his second—put the first enemy aircraft into a spin. Pilot Officer Truscott witnessed it diving steeply at 1,000ft and spinning. At midday 452, 602 and 485 participated in Circus 74 but made no claims. At 17:45 Circus 75 yielded another response from the Luftwaffe. Kenley performed the role of escort wing. Eight Bf 109s engaged at 9,000ft and 452 claimed seven. Finucane engaged one which caught fire and emitted a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>white</b> smoke. He then opened fire on another from 10 yards after his gun sight failed. The Bf 109 lost its tail unit. The day's successes were victory numbers 9, 10 and 11.|$|E

Several hip-hop activists have also {{reflected}} on Johnson's legacy, {{most notably in}} the album The New Danger, by Mos Def, in which songs like [...] "Zimzallabim" [...] and [...] "Blue Black Jack" [...] are devoted to the artist's pugilistic hero. Additionally, both Southern punk rock band This Bike is a Pipe Bomb and alternative country performer Tom Russell have songs dedicated to Johnson. Russell's piece is both a tribute and a biting indictment of the racism Johnson faced: [...] "here comes Jack Johnson, like he owns the town, there's a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>white</b> Americans {{like to see a}} man go down... like to see a black man drown." ...|$|E

2500|$|Christgau {{has named}} Louis Armstrong, Thelonious Monk, Chuck Berry, the Beatles, and the New York Dolls as his top five artists of all time. In a 1998 obituary, he called Frank Sinatra [...] "the {{greatest}} {{singer of the}} 20th century". Christgau readily admits to having prejudices and generally disliking genres such as heavy metal, art rock, progressive rock, bluegrass, gospel, Irish folk, and jazz fusion. [...] "I admire metal's integrity, brutality, and obsessiveness", Christgau wrote in 1986, [...] "but I can't stand its delusions of grandeur, the way it apes and misapprehends reactionary notions of nobility". He has {{said he is not}} [...] "encyclopedic" [...] about popular music; Wolk wrote that [...] "there are not a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>white</b> guys in their 60s waving the flag for Lil Wayne's Da Drought 3, especially not in the same column as they wave the flag for a Willie Nelson/Merle Haggard/Ray Price trio album, an anthology of new Chinese pop, Vampire Weekend, and Wussy (who? Well, if Christgau gave 'em an A, maybe you'd best find out)." [...] In his 2000 Consumer Guide book, Christgau said his favorite rock album was either The Clash (1977) or New York Dolls (1973), while his favorite record in general was Monk's 1958 Misterioso. In July 2013, during an interview with Esquire magazine's Peter Gerstenzang, Christgau criticized the voters at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, saying [...] "they're pretty stupid" [...] for not voting in the New York Dolls.|$|E

Of course you cannot always do that when you are running a saloon, but even here you can do fairly well if you keep your eyes open and act according to character. If it is a great big swaggering sort of bully who gets drunk and kicks up a row, I have pistols always handy behind the bar, and when I jump over with one in each hand I can generally get him out as quiet as a lamb. If I see that it is a regular hard case, a fellow who means downright mischief, I lie low and take no heed, only sending out my man quietly to fetch a constable. As a rule he never finds one, still it makes all the difference. If there is a man shot and an inquest the next morning I am able to prove that I did my best to put a stop to the matter, and so I get off without being blamed; for a New Orleans jury are not fools enough to suppose anyone is going to shove himself between two angry men when their hands go to their pistol pockets.' ...|$|E
