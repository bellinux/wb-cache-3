40|$|The paper {{approaches}} in a systemic manner {{the topic of}} <b>local</b> <b>development,</b> attempting, on one hand, to turn into account the previous contributions from the specialized literature and, on the other hand, to emphasize the specific mechanisms, describing and modelling {{the behavior of a}} <b>local</b> <b>development</b> system, underlining its feedback. The basic hypotheses of a systemic model for <b>local</b> <b>development</b> are synthesized in emphasizing three main subsystems, representing three levels of public management. At the same time, a <b>local</b> <b>development</b> system is composed by the convergence of two cybernetic systems, namely an administrative and an economic one, each with specific missions. Consequently, the paper aims a model for an economic-administrative system of <b>local</b> <b>development</b> (SEADL), whose self-regulation mechanisms are based on qualitative assessments, concerning the relevance or usefulness/sustainability of a <b>local</b> <b>development</b> policy as well as quantitative assessments, referring to efficiency or effectiveness. In the end of the paper a case study is presented in details, being achieved in Braila Municipality, valorising SEADL feedback, using assessments based on production factors or Keynesian approaches. The study represents only a framework, a general one for approaching a complex topic, such as <b>local</b> <b>development,</b> and it may be obviously completed and improved. local development; cybernetic system; feedback of local development; social and economic impact. ...|$|R
