Deep learning is useful in semantic hashing where a deep graphical model the word-count vectors obtained from a large set of documents.

Documents similar to a query document can then be found by accessing all the addresses that differ by only a few bits from the address of the query document. Unlike sparse distributed memory that operates on 1000-bit addresses, semantic hashing works on 32 or 64-bit addresses found in a conventional computer architecture.|$|E

He used the services of his friend and <b>local</b> <b>model</b> ship maker Gérard Liger-Belair, son of a former naval officer and who owned a shop in Brussels that specialised in model ships, to find an appropriate historical vessel that he could customize to meet his historical needs.

As Hergé preferred the battleship, Liger-Belair continued to research and discovered a historic document titled , which contained detailed drawings of French battleships. One in particular was from 1690, in the navy of Louis XIV of France: a fourth rank battleship with 56 cannons: [...] Liger-Belair soon completed a plan on a 1:100 scale followed by an extremely precise model.|$|E
2500|$|Although kelp {{forests are}} unknown in {{tropical}} surface waters, a few species of Laminaria {{have been known}} to occur exclusively in tropical deep waters. This general absence of kelp from the tropics is believed to be mostly due to insufficient nutrient levels associated with warm, oligotrophic waters. One recent study spatially overlaid the requisite physical parameters for kelp with mean oceanographic conditions has produced a model predicting the existence of subsurface kelps throughout the tropics worldwide to depths of 200 m. For a hotspot in the Galapagos Islands, the <b>local</b> <b>model</b> was improved with fine-scale data and tested; the research team found thriving kelp forests in all eight of their sampled sites, all of which had been predicted by the model, thus validated their approach. This suggests that their global model might actually be fairly accurate, and if so, kelp forests would be prolific in tropical subsurface waters worldwide. The importance of this contribution has been rapidly acknowledged within the scientific community and has prompted an entirely new trajectory of kelp forest research, particularly emphasizing the potential for a spatial refuge from climate change also the [...] explanations to evolutionary patterns of kelps worldwide.|$|E

40|$|Parallelization {{framework}} {{has become}} a necessity {{to speed up the}} training of deep neural networks (DNN) recently. Such framework typically employs the Model Average approach, denoted as MA-DNN, in which parallel workers conduct respective training based on their own local data while the parameters of <b>local</b> <b>models</b> are periodically communicated and averaged to obtain a global model which serves as the new start of <b>local</b> <b>models.</b> However, since DNN is a highly non-convex model, averaging parameters cannot ensure that such global model can perform better than those <b>local</b> <b>models.</b> To tackle this problem, we introduce a new parallel training framework called Ensemble-Compression, denoted as EC-DNN. In this framework, we propose to aggregate the <b>local</b> <b>models</b> by ensemble, i. e., averaging the outputs of <b>local</b> <b>models</b> instead of the parameters. As most of prevalent loss functions are convex to the output of DNN, the performance of ensemble-based global model is guaranteed to be at least as good as the average performance of <b>local</b> <b>models.</b> However, a big challenge lies in the explosion of model size since each round of ensemble can give rise to multiple times size increment. Thus, we carry out model compression after each ensemble, specialized by a distillation based method in this paper, {{to reduce the size of}} the global model to be the same as the local ones. Our experimental results demonstrate the prominent advantage of EC-DNN over MA-DNN in terms of both accuracy and speedup. Comment: ECML 201...|$|R
