5|$|Plans for the {{single-track}} Queens Super Express Bypass for the IND Queens Boulevard Line {{had been}} doubled to two tracks in 1972. The BMT Jamaica Line from 121st Street to 168th Street would be demolished {{to make room}} for a connection to the lower level of the Archer Avenue Line, which extended east to Jamaica Center–Parsons/Archer. A year later, a final design for the Northeast Queens LIE line was published, while other final engineering for the Southeast Queens line was imminent. In the summer of 1972, ground was broken on the Southeast Queens Line along Archer Avenue to 147th Place. Two southeast Brooklyn IRT routes—the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line extension to Avenue W, as well as an IRT Eastern Parkway <b>Line</b> <b>branch</b> under Utica Avenue to Avenue U—were being designed. The MCTA, which was by now renamed the MTA, were rerouting the proposed IRT Pelham <b>Line</b> <b>branch</b> to Co-op City via New Haven Railroad right of way.|$|E
5|$|Aldwych is {{a closed}} {{station on the}} London Underground, located in the City of Westminster in Central London. It was opened in 1907 with the name Strand, after the street on which it is located, and was the {{terminus}} of the short Piccadilly <b>line</b> <b>branch</b> from Holborn that was {{a relic of the}} merger of two railway schemes. The station building is close to the Strand's junction with Surrey Street, near Aldwych. During its lifetime, the branch {{was the subject of a}} number of unrealised extension proposals that would have seen the tunnels through the station extended southwards, usually to Waterloo.|$|E
5|$|Shepton Mallet had railway {{stations}} on two lines, {{both now}} closed. The first station, called Shepton Mallet (High Street) in British Railways days, {{was on the}} East Somerset Railway branch line from Witham and opened in 1859. The line was extended to Wells in 1862 and later connected to the Cheddar Valley <b>line</b> <b>branch</b> of the Bristol and Exeter Railway from Yatton to Wells via Cheddar. Through services between Yatton and Witham started in 1870. The line was absorbed into the Great Western Railway in the 1870s.|$|E
50|$|Several <b>branch</b> <b>lines</b> {{were built}} from the railway {{stations}} of Genthin and Güsen there {{were that the}} Jerichower Land. From Genthin <b>lines</b> <b>branched</b> to Sandau via Jerichow; from Güsen <b>lines</b> <b>branched</b> to Ziesar and Jerichow. All of these <b>branch</b> <b>lines</b> were nationalised in 1949. They are all now closed for passenger traffic and except for short sections for freight traffic.|$|R
50|$|This is the westernmost stop on {{the four}} stop trunk segment shared by all four lines. West of here, {{approaching}} the TRE tracks, the Orange and Green <b>Lines</b> <b>branch</b> north and the Red and Blue <b>Lines</b> <b>branch</b> south.|$|R

5|$|Located at the {{junction}} of two earlier tube railway schemes, the station was opened in 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP). The station entrances and below ground circulation were largely reconstructed for the introduction of escalators {{and the opening of}} Central line platforms in 1933, making the station the only interchange between the lines. Before 1994, Holborn was the northern terminus of the short and little-frequented Piccadilly <b>line</b> <b>branch</b> to Aldwych and two platforms originally used for this service are disused. One of the disused platforms has been used for location filming when a London Underground station platform is needed.|$|E
5|$|MetroLink began {{service on}} July 31, 1993, {{with the opening}} of the Red Line segment from North Hanley to 5th & Missouri. An infill station at East Riverfront and an {{extension}} to Lambert–St. Louis International Airport opened in 1994, followed by a second station at the airport in 1998. Since then, the system has had two major expansions. The first expansion, known as the St. Clair County Extension, was completed on May 5, 2001, with the extension of the Red Line to Belleville, Illinois and two years later to Scott Air Force Base. The second major expansion, known as the Cross County Extension, was completed on August 26, 2006, with the addition of the Blue <b>Line</b> <b>branch</b> from Forest Park-DeBaliviere to Shrewsbury-Lansdowne I-44 via Clayton, Missouri.|$|E
5|$|Service on the Yellow Line {{began on}} April 30, 1983, adding Archives {{to the system}} and linking the two already-built {{stations}} of Gallery Place and Pentagon with a bridge across the Potomac River. It was extended beyond National Airport by four stations to Huntington on December 17, 1983, the first station outside of the Capital Beltway. When the Green Line link to U Street opened on May 11, 1991, it acted {{as an extension of}} the Yellow Line until the southern Green <b>Line</b> <b>branch</b> was completed. When Green Line service began, the Yellow Line was truncated at Mount Vernon Square, where a pocket track exists to relay trains.|$|E
5000|$|East of this station, {{the light}} rail's transit mall ends and grade-separated tracks begin, with the Red, Orange and Blue <b>lines</b> <b>branching</b> north at a wye and {{descending}} into a tunnel under the expressway, while the Green <b>Line</b> <b>branches</b> southeast.|$|R

5|$|The Welsh Government manages {{those parts}} of the British railway network within Wales. Cardiff Central is Wales' busiest railway station, with over four times as much {{passenger}} traffic as any other station in Wales. The Cardiff region has its own urban rail network. Beeching cuts in the 1960s mean that most of the remaining network is geared toward east-west travel connecting with the Irish Sea ports for ferries to Ireland. Services between north and south Wales operate through the English towns of Chester and Shrewsbury along the Welsh Marches Line. All trains in Wales are diesel-powered, since no lines have been electrified. However, the South Wales Main <b>Line</b> <b>branch</b> of the Great Western Main Line used by services from London Paddington to Cardiff and Swansea, is undergoing electrification.|$|E
5|$|The {{only time}} the Red Line shared tracks with another line was from January 27, 1997 to September 17, 1999, when the Green Line Commuter Shortcut used Red Line tracks from Brookland–CUA to Farragut North. A short {{time after the}} Green <b>Line</b> <b>branch</b> north of Fort Totten opened in the early 1990s, the Green Line Commuter Shortcut began as a six-month experiment. Passengers could board the Green Line between Greenbelt and West Hyattsville and travel as far as Farragut North without having to transfer; the trains {{bypassed}} Fort Totten via a single-track spur between the West Hyattsville and Brookland–CUA stations. Due to its success, the shortcut continued until the mid-city portion of the Green Line was completed in 1999.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s {{the number of}} {{passengers}} using the branch stabilised at about 800 people each weekday. In 2009 the Chesham branch saw 427,000 journeys each year. The proposal to close the Aylesbury–Marylebone route was dropped, and instead the line was upgraded and equipped with fast British Rail Class 165 trains in the early 1990s. These reduced the travel time between Chalfont& Latimer and Marylebone to 33 minutes, increasing usage of the line as a commuter route. The Chesham branch was proposed as a terminus for the original Crossrail scheme, which would have seen Crossrail trains running from Paddington to serve the stations between Rickmansworth and Aylesbury and the Chesham branch, allowing London Transport to withdraw from Buckinghamshire and cut the Metropolitan line back to serve only the branches to Watford and Uxbridge. The bill proposing the scheme was defeated in Parliament and abandoned in 1995, and the revived scheme authorised by the Crossrail Act 2008 {{did not include the}} branches to Aylesbury and Chesham. By this time the little-used Central <b>line</b> <b>branch</b> from Epping to Ongar had closed, with the last services running on 30 September 1994, leaving Chesham—already the westernmost point of the London Underground network since 1961's withdrawal from Aylesbury—as the northernmost point on the London Underground.|$|E

5000|$|The Blenheim and Woodstock <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> was a 4 mi long railway <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> {{that ran}} from Kidlington railway station along the Cherwell Valley Line north to Shipton-on-Cherwell where the <b>line</b> <b>branched</b> off west past [...] towards Woodstock.|$|R
50|$|The <b>line</b> <b>branches</b> off the Southern {{line in the}} {{township}} of Wyreema (then called Beauaraba) 17 km south of the major regional city of Toowoomba and opened on 19 September 1887. The Southern <b>line</b> <b>branched</b> from Gowrie Junction until {{the opening of the}} Drayton Deviation from Toowoomba direct to Wyreema in 1915.|$|R
5|$|The road then {{continues}} roughly north and crosses a largely open area of pasture. The SouthCare emergency helicopter is stationed {{to the east}} of the road not far after its intersection with Lanyon Drive, and further on, a prison is located to the west. Approaching the northern end of the pasture, Jerrabomberra Creek flows to the east. At the northern end is the Hindmarsh Drive interchange. The highway passes underneath Hindmarsh Drive and continues over Jerrabomberra Creek. A further interchange, passing over Canberra Avenue is a little further on, along with an overpass above the Canberra railway <b>line</b> <b>branch,</b> and an interchange above Newcastle Street. The road then doglegs across a wide flat and terminates at Morshead Drive, just across the Molonglo River. In 2010 the average annual daily traffic count was approximately 43,000 vehicles per day, at this final section just prior to the northern terminus.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of a railway to Kew was pushed by the Kew Railway League, which urged that the <b>line</b> <b>branch</b> from the Lilydale line west of Hawthorn station, passing on an easy curve {{on the right side}} of Bulleen Road (now Church Street, Hawthorn and High Street South, Kew), through low-lying vacant land and old brick fields, to Kew and Prospect Hill. A tunnel under Burwood Road would have been required, but that was offset by no cuttings being required.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 21st century, the Great Western main line and the Midland Main Line were the last of the major main line routes in the UK using diesel trains as the main source of {{locomotive}} power. When the announcement was made in July 2009 to electrify the Great Western (along with the Liverpool-Manchester line), it represented the first big rail electrification project in the UK for 20 years. The South Wales Main <b>Line</b> <b>branch</b> of the GWML is set to be the first electrified cross-country railway line in Wales.|$|E
25|$|Several other {{corridors}} {{were considered}} in the 2003 PMT. These included a Dudley-Ashmont route replacing the #23 bus (also revived in 2006 in Phase III planning, but not during the 28X proposal), {{as well as a}} new BRT tunnel to Kenmore with surface branches to the Longwood Medical Area via Brookline Avenue and Allston via Commonwealth Avenue, the Mass Pike, and Cambridge Street. The City of Boston proposed an alternate western Silver <b>Line</b> <b>branch</b> using buses along the Mass Pike without a new tunnel, similar to existing express buses.|$|E

25|$|Jubilee line {{stations}} {{north of}} Baker Street were not built {{specifically for the}} Jubilee line. St. John's Wood and Swiss Cottage stations were opened in 1939 on the then-new Bakerloo <b>line</b> <b>branch</b> and have more traditional tube station features. Stations north of Finchley Road were opened by the Metropolitan Railway (now the Metropolitan line), but they {{became part of the}} Bakerloo in 1939, with only Wembley Park being shared with the Metropolitan. Then, the Jubilee line took over the whole of the Bakerloo line service between Baker Street and Stanmore. The only 'new' stations built for the original Jubilee line were the Baker Street westbound platform (eastbound opened in 1939), Bond Street, Green Park and the now-closed Charing Cross.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} the metro fueled the closing of tram lines, and in 1966 the {{connection}} between Grensen and Sagene closed, followed the next year by the Vippetangen Line (that since 1964 had been used for grain transport), the Helsfyr Line and the Simensbråten <b>Line</b> <b>branch</b> of the Ekeberg Line. The last closing of a tram line occurred on 24 June 1968 when the connection between Schewigaard Street and Etterstad was terminated. The tide changed in 1969 when the turning loop at Sinsen was needed to build the Sinsen Interchange—instead of closing the line a new loop was built at Muselunden. In 1972 the planned closing of the Ekeberg Line was canceled and remained, despite a new line needing to be built to allow passage during {{the construction of the}} central station.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the fourth}} quarter, Yepremian {{increased}} Miami's lead to 19–14 with a 46-yard field goal. Later in the period, Oakland got the ball on their own 17-yard line. Stabler started the drive with an 11-yard completion to Biletnikoff. On the next play, he threw a pass to Cliff Branch at the Dolphins' 27-yard <b>line.</b> <b>Branch</b> made a spectacular diving catch and then got back up and ran {{the rest of the}} way to the end zone for a 72-yard touchdown reception, giving the Raiders a 21–19 lead with 4:37 left in the game. With 2:08 left to play, the Dolphins took a 26–21 lead with a 68-yard, 4-play drive that ended with Benny Malone's 23-yard touchdown run, evading four tackle attempts by Raider defenders on the way to the end zone.|$|E
