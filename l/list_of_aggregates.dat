30|$|The Recommendation Manager is {{the core}} {{component}} of the QuARAM Service Recommender that manages and coordinates the various components. The recommendation manager receives {{the requirements of the}} customer’s application and its deployment entities from the requirement/deployment entity extractor. Then, it sends these requirements to the case-based recommender, which returns a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> recommendations, along with their similarity to the customer’s query and the adapted solutions. Based on the similarity of the retrieved cases, the recommendation manager decides whether to send the recommendations to the customer based on a pre-specified similarity threshold. The top 5 recommendations (or the top n that have similarity above the threshold where n[*]<[*]= 5) are sent to the customer to choose from if all of the top 5 have similarity above the threshold. If none of the retrieved cases scores has a similarity above the threshold, the recommendation manager uses the information of the deployment entities of the application to find a more fine-grained configuration for the application deployment. All proposed configurations are sent to service consolidator, which returns a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregate</b> recommendations that best fit the whole application. The recommendation manager then sends this list to the customer.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe effects <b>of</b> <b>aggregate</b> mineralogical {{composition}} on moisture sensitivity of aggregate–bitumen bonds were investigated using four aggregate types (two limestone and two granite) and two bitumen grades (40 / 60 pen and 70 / 100 pen). Moisture sensitivity (or water resistance) of the aggregate–bitumen bonds were characterized using retained strength obtained {{from three different}} tensile tests (peel, PATTI and pull-off). The results showed {{significant differences in the}} amount of moisture absorbed by a given aggregate which suggested strong correlations between aggregate mineral composition and moisture absorption. For most of the aggregate–bitumen bonds, failure surfaces transformed from cohesive to adhesive with conditioning time thereby confirming the strong influence <b>of</b> moisture on <b>aggregate</b> bonds. The three tensile tests used in this study showed similar rankings in terms of moisture sensitivity but the pull-off test was found to be the most sensitive. The effect of bitumen on moisture sensitivity was found to be lower than the effect <b>of</b> <b>aggregates,</b> with the moisture absorption properties <b>of</b> the <b>aggregates</b> depending strongly on certain key minerals including clay, anorthite and calcite. Strong correlations were also found between mineral compositions and moisture sensitivity with clay and anorthite having strong negative influence while calcite showed positive effect on moisture sensitivity. Previous studies have identified various mineral phases like albite, quartz, and k-feldspar, as detrimental in terms of moisture sensitivity. The results appear to support the extension <b>of</b> the existing <b>list</b> <b>of</b> detrimental <b>aggregate</b> minerals to include anorthite and clay while supporting the case of calcite as a moisture resistant mineral...|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} {{composition}} ran as follows. First, Cage put a transparent strip of about three-quarter inch over the maps. The {{width of the}} strip limited the number of stars used. Within this width Cage was able to discern the twelve tones of the octave. Then through chance operations using the I Ching, he transferred these tones to the available octaves for {{the left and right}} hands. The resulting notes reflect only the horizontal positions of the stars, and not all stars are used, because the maps used a variety of colors, and Cage's chance operations limited the choices every time to specific colors. In the end Cage would have a string of notes and ask the I Ching which of them are to remain single tones and which are to become parts <b>of</b> <b>aggregates.</b> In the first etude this question is answered by a single number, in the second by two numbers, etc. So as the etudes progress, {{there are more and more}} aggregates: in the first, most sounds are single tones, in the final, thirty-second etude, roughly half of the sounds are aggregates. The aggregates themselves were selected from the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> available <b>aggregates,</b> described above. Due to health problems, Cage himself was unable to prepare the manuscript; this was done for him by Carlo Carnevali (etudes I-VIII) and Wilmia Polnauer (etudes IX-XXXII).|$|R
