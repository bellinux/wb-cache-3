2500|$|Released on January 11, 2005 {{during the}} Macworld expo, the first-generation iPod Shuffle weighed , and was {{designed}} to be easily loaded with a selection of songs and to play them in random order. According to Apple, owners of existing iPods had often left the music selection to [...] "shuffle", and the new iPod Shuffle was a way of implementing that in a much more cost-effective fashion. It relied on the use of an [...] "autofill" [...] feature in iTunes, which selected songs at random from a user's music library (or from a specific playlist) and copied as many as would fit into the iPod Shuffle's storage. The first generation could hold up to 240 songs (1GB model, based on Apple's estimate, of four minutes per song and 128 kbit/s AAC encoding). It used the SigmaTel STMP35xx system on a chip (SOC) and its software development kit (SDK) v2.6, a flash memory IC, and USB rechargeable <b>lithium</b> <b>cell.</b> The STMP35xx SOC and its software was the most fully integrated portable MP3 playback system at release time and SigmaTel was Austin's largest IPO (2003) capturing over 60% of flash based MP3 player world market share in 2004. In 2005, peak iPod first-generation Shuffle production occurred at a hundred thousand units per day, at the Asus factory.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} evaluation of the real-time degradation characteristics of lithium-diffused silicon solar cells are reported. A strontium- 90 radioisotope was used for simulation of a typical earth-orbital electron environment. The experiment was performed in an ion pump vacuum chamber with samples maintained at - 50, + 20, + 50, and + 80 C. Samples were illuminated during the 6 -month exposure run with solar cell 1 - 5 characteristics measured periodically in situ. This 6 -month exposure corresponded to a 1 MeV equivalent fluence of approximately 10 to the 14 th power electrons/sq cm.

[...] The cell contains a liquid mixture of thionyl chloride (SOCl2), lithium tetrachloroaluminate (...) , and niobium pentachloride (...) which act as the catholyte, electrolyte, and electron sink, dendrite preventative during reverse voltage condition, electrolyte, [...] respectively. A porous carbon material serves as a cathode current collector which receives electrons from the external circuit.

50|$|In {{the cell}} as {{developed}} for cardiac pacemaker application, the anode is lithium and the cathode a proprietary composition of iodine and poly-2-vinyl pyridine, {{neither of which}} is electrically conductive. However, after processing by mixing and heating to ~ 150 °C for 72 hours the components react {{with each other to}} form an electrically conductive viscous liquid which, while still molten, is poured into the cell where it cools to form a solid. When the liquid contacts the lithium anode it creates a monomolecular layer of semiconducting crystalline lithium iodide. As the cell is discharged by the current load of the pacemaker, the reaction between the lithium anode and iodine cathode forms a growing barrier of lithium iodide, which being resistive causes the terminal voltage of the cell to decrease approximately as an inverse function of the volume of the barrier. Pacemaker designers use this characteristic to permit detection of incipient 'end of life' of the pacemaker's <b>lithium</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|E

40|$|Materials {{derived from}} the layered {{compound}} NaTi 3 O 6 OH · 2 H 2 O, also known as “sodium nonatitanate ” or NNT, have recently been found to undergo reversible sodium or lithium intercalation processes at very low potentials. While practical discharge capacities in <b>lithium</b> <b>cells</b> can be above 200 mAh/g, making them of interest for high-energy applications, the presence of mobile sodium in the materials complicates the cycling behavior. A simple ion-exchange process prior to incorporation in electrochemical cells removes all sodium ions, producing the lithiated form of the material. The lithiated material (LNT) performs similarly to NNT in <b>lithium</b> <b>cells,</b> although coulombic inefficiencies are somewhat higher.

5000|$|... 1979 - Working in {{separate}} groups, at Stanford University Ned A.

This innovation provided the positive electrode material that made lithium batteries commercially possible. [...] is a stable positive electrode material which acts as a donor of lithium ions, which means {{that it can be}} used with a negative electrode material other than lithium metal. By enabling the use of stable and easy-to-handle negative electrode materials, [...] opened a whole new range of possibilities for novel rechargeable battery systems. Godshall et al. further identified in 1979, along with LiCoO2, the similar value of ternary compound lithium-transition metal-oxides such as the spinel LiMn2O4, Li2MnO3, LiMnO2, LiFeO2, LiFe5O8, and LiFe5O4 (and later lithium-copper-oxide and lithium-nickel-oxide cathode materials in 1985) ...|$|E
5000|$|Fig. 3 shows {{a typical}} Pulses Plus schematic. The pack {{includes}} diodes in each branch {{to minimize the}} possibility of reverse charging the cells. PTCs, or positive temperature coefficient thermistors act as resettable fuses. PTCs begin to get warm at a trip current. The warmth increases their resistance which produces even more heat, and the PTC quickly [...] "trips" [...] and shuts off most of the current. The PTC rarely trips in a typical ADCP pack, because the safety circuit is the primary protection against short circuits (defined to be any current above about 8 A). The safety circuit also turns off the pack before its voltage falls below a threshold. If the pack were allowed to fully discharge, one branch could discharge before the others, {{which could lead to}} the discharged branch being charged by the remaining cells. Any attempt to charge a <b>lithium</b> <b>cell</b> is potentially dangerous, and turning the pack off at about 75-80% of its starting voltage prevents this from happening. At this voltage, only around 3% of the capacity remains, but the remaining capacity still allows years for disposal of the pack before it discharges fully.|$|E
50|$|Nanoball {{batteries}} show a lot {{of potential}} but improvements have to be made before they become a viable option to replace current batteries. Future research would include trying to integrate the nanoballs into the cathode of a <b>lithium</b> <b>cell</b> or merging nanoballs with other materials like silicon in batteries. Research done at the School of Material Science and Engineering at East China University of Science and Technology has shown that coating silicon nanoballs with a graphene/carbon coating keeps the silicon nanoball from degrading too quickly and improving the overall electromechanical performance of the battery. For commercial use in cars and other electrical vehicles, the nanoball battery would {{need to be able to}} charge the vehicle using less energy. Even though the battery can discharge very quickly, too much energy is needed to go into the battery. Another issue that needs correcting is that even though the battery can discharge very quickly, it has difficulty holding on to that much energy for very long. Increasing the limit of how much energy the battery could hold would make the battery much more efficient. The technology may also allow for smaller batteries as the cathode material degrades at a slower rate than in current production batteries.|$|E

5000|$|Lithium ion rechargable {{battery cells}} are rather more {{sensitive}} to overcharging, overheating, improper charge levels during storage, {{and other forms of}} mistreatment than most commonly used battery chemistries. The reason is that the various lithium battery chemistries are susceptible to chemical damage (eg, cathode fouling, molecular breakdown, etc) by only very slight overvoltages (ie, millivolts) during charging, or more charging current than the internal chemistry can tolerate at this point in its charge/discharge cycle, and so on. Heat accelerates these unwanted, but so far inescapable, chemical reactions and overheating during charging amplifies those effects. Because lithium chemistries often permit flexible membrane structures, lithium cells can be deployed in flexible though sealed bags, which permits higher packing densities within a battery pack. Some of the breakdown products (usually of electrolyte chemicals or additives) outgas when mistreated; such cells will become 'puffy' and are very much on the way to failure. In sealed lithium ion cylinders, the same outgassing has caused rather large pressures (800+ psi has been reported); such cells can explode if not provided with a relief failure mechanism. Compounding the danger is that many <b>lithium</b> <b>cell</b> chemistries include hydrocarbon chemicals (the exact nature of which is typically proprietary) which are flammable. Not only is explosion a possibility with mistreated lithium cells, but even a non-explosive leak can cause a fire.|$|E
