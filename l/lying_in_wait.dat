5|$|As {{flagship}} of Nishimura's Southern Force, Yamashiro left Brunei at 15:30 on 22 October 1944, heading east {{into the}} Sulu Sea {{and then to}} the northeast into the Mindanao Sea. Intending to join Vice-Admiral Takeo Kurita's force in Leyte Gulf, they passed west of Mindanao Island into Surigao Strait, where they met a large force of battleships and cruisers <b>lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>wait.</b> The Battle of Surigao Strait would become the southernmost action in the Battle of Leyte Gulf.|$|E
5|$|At {{least four}} of the gunmen were {{soldiers}} from the UDR, the locally recruited infantry regiment of the British Army in Northern Ireland. Martin Dillon suggested in The Dirty War, that at least five serving UDR soldiers were present at the checkpoint. All the gunmen {{were members of the}} UVF's Mid-Ulster Brigade, and had been <b>lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>wait</b> to ambush the band, having set up the checkpoint just minutes before.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} trap Williams, Power asked Williams {{to meet him}} at Moorgate Street Station the {{following}} day. Police were <b>lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>wait</b> and arrested both Power and Williams at the Moorgate station. Police covered Williams's head with an apron to prevent him from being photographed and thus possibly influencing witnesses. However, no one had glimpsed the murderer's face, and no one selected Williams from an identity parade. Power was immediately released.|$|E

5|$|Commanded by Rear Admiral Masami Ban, Fusō left Brunei at 15:30 on 22 October 1944 {{as part of}} Nishimura's Southern Force, heading east {{into the}} Sulu Sea and then {{northeast}} into the Mindanao Sea. Intending to join Vice-Admiral Takeo Kurita's force in Leyte Gulf, the force passed west of Mindanao Island into Surigao Strait, where it met a large force of battleships and cruisers <b>lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>wait.</b> The Battle of Surigao Strait became the southernmost action in the Battle of Leyte Gulf.|$|E
5|$|Fusō and Yamashiro {{were the}} only two Japanese battleships at the Battle of Surigao Strait, the southernmost action of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and both were lost {{in the early hours of}} 25 October 1944 to torpedoes and naval gunfire. Some eyewitnesses later claimed that Fusō broke in half, and that both halves {{remained}} afloat and burning for an hour, but historian Anthony Tully has made the case that she simply sank after forty minutes of flooding. Six battleships and eight cruisers were <b>lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>wait</b> for Yamashiro; she did not survive the encounter, and Vice-Admiral Shōji Nishimura went down with his ship. Only ten crewmembers from each ship survived.|$|E
5|$|Powers {{helped the}} police perform a sting operation, telling Seymour {{that the police}} knew what had {{happened}} and {{that the only way to}} save Williams was to dig up the gun and move it to somewhere more safe. When Seymour and Powers went to do this, several policemen (who had been <b>lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>wait)</b> immediately arrested her and Powers (who was released a few hours later). Seymour was in a poor condition both physically and mentally, and after a few hours she wrote and signed a statement which incriminated Williams. Powers again helped the police, convincing Williams to meet him at Moorgate station, where Williams was arrested by the police and charged with the murder of Arthur Walls. Williams maintained that he was innocent of the murder and burglary.|$|E

5|$|After {{an armored}} car leaves a bank with ten million dollars, it is {{attacked}} en route by Diabolik who manages {{to steal the}} money and escape with his partner Eva Kant. Leaving the money in their underground hideout, Diabolik and Eva attend a press conference held by the Minister of the Interior which they disrupt by releasing laughing gas. Due to {{the high level of}} crime, the death penalty is brought back. The police cannot find Diabolik, and gang leader Valmont suffers at their hands from a clampdown because of his actions. Realising things can only get worse because of Diabolik's crime spree, Valmont contacts Inspector Ginko and makes a deal to catch him for the police. At his hideout, Diabolik decides to steal the famous Aksand emerald necklace from the Saint Just Castle for Eva's birthday. Valmont builds up an identikit picture of Eva and circulates it as a means of capturing Diabolik. Diabolik scales the walls of Saint Just Castle where he finds the police <b>lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>wait.</b> He manages to steal the necklace by fooling the police officers with mirrors on the road and dummy decoys of himself.|$|E
5|$|This theory {{stems from}} the various rumours {{spreading}} after Centaurs sinking. If Centaur had been in breach of the Hague Convention of 1907, and someone had informed the Japanese of this, I-177 may have been under valid orders to attack. When Centaur left Sydney, her decks were packed with green-uniformed men, and as Field Ambulance uniforms were only distinguishable from other Army uniforms by badge insignia and the colouration of the cloth band ringing the hat, a distant observer could {{have concluded that the}} hospital ship was transporting soldiers. Those witnessing the loading in Sydney would have seen the ambulance drivers bring their weapons aboard, and could have come to a similar conclusion. If a spy or informant had passed this information to the Japanese, I-177 could have been <b>lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>wait.</b> The main flaw in this theory is the question of how Nakagawa and his crew were able to predict that Centaur was taking an alternative route and how they were able to determine the new route selected.|$|E

The Portuguese paid 20,000 pesos for the escort.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, {{a number}} of Japanese {{citizens}} disappeared from coastal areas in Japan. The people who had disappeared were average Japanese people who were opportunistically abducted by operatives <b>lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>wait.</b> Although North Korean agents were suspected, the opinion that North Korea {{had nothing to do}} with the disappearances was widely held. Most of the missing were in their 20s; the youngest, Megumi Yokota, was 13 when she disappeared in November 1977, from the Japanese west coast city of Niigata.|$|E
25|$|Aliens {{can produce}} a thick, strong resin that they use to build their hives and to cocoon their victims, and they can use the walls of their hives as camouflage. Aliens also salivate heavily {{in the form of}} a sticky, clear slime; while not a toxic {{substance}} in and of itself, it is common for the Alien films to use it as a suspense-building device, wherein a character will notice the falling saliva before noticing its source <b>lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>wait</b> above them.|$|E

Perry tackled the ringleader of the pirates and took him prisoner after a cat-and-mouse chase in a darkened engine room. Pirate ringleader Abduwali Muse cut his hand trying to keep Perry's knife away from his neck. The pirate was then tied up and his wounds were treated by Second Mate Ken Quinn.|$|E
25|$|On December 19, 1880, Billy the Kid, Charlie Bowdre, Tom Pickett, Billy Wilson and Tom O'Folliard rode into Fort Sumner. <b>Lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>wait</b> were deputy Garrett and his posse.

Three days later, Garrett's posse cornered the Kid and his companions at a spot called Stinking Springs. They killed one man and {{captured}} the others, including the Kid. On April 15, 1881, Billy the Kid was sentenced to hang by Judge Warren Bristol, but he escaped thirteen days later.|$|E

25|$|After the war, {{examination}} of German records showed the submarine attacked was the , badly damaged after being rammed by the Flower-class corvette HMS Crocus {{off the coast}} of West Africa. German lookouts had seen the torpedoes' tracks, enabling U-333 to evade the torpedoes; the torpedoes then self-detonated for unknown reasons. The commander of U-333 was Peter-Erich Cremer. In his post-war account of the attack, he suggested the rattling and banging noises Graphs crew had heard were due to the severe damage previously inflicted on U-333. His route back to France closely hugged the Spanish coastline, a pattern followed by other U-boats, and he had also believed that Marriott was aware of this and had been <b>lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>wait.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{the left}} of the brigade's line, a patrol of 17 men from the Glosters' C Company <b>lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>wait</b> on the river bank repulsed three {{attempts}} by a battalion of the 559th Regiment, 187th Division to cross the river, eventually retiring without loss when their ammunition ran low and assaulting troops finally gained the opposite bank. During the night the Glosters' A and D Companies were attacked, and by 07:30 A Company, outnumbered six to one, had been forced from its position on Castle Hill. An attempt to retake it failed, during which Lieutenant Philip Curtis single-handedly destroyed an enemy machine-gun position, for which he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E

They entered the street of Trapitos and took up positions outside one of the houses there. At night this street {{was one of the most}} deserted in the city. The block in question was made up of four houses, none of which opened on Trapitos. There were no doors, but there were some balconies overlooking the street. Shortly after the arrival of the masked men, a rope ladder was thrown down from one of these balconies, and a man wrapped in a cape began to descend. Just before he reached the street, the four men <b>lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>wait</b> began to beat him with sandbags.|$|E
