Initially only these vehicles were permitted to operate the Eccles line but the entire fleet except for 3 (1018, 1019, 1020) were modified between 2008 and 2012 for universal running, under a programme known as the T-68X Universal Running programme.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{designed}} to be used with the QUAD II, 303, or 405 power amplifiers with <b>limiters,</b> a power amplifier capable of delivering 15 watts per channel suffices – excessive voltage input is known to cause arcing within the speaker panels. In fact, the instructions book states that any properly-regulated amplifier delivering no more than 33V is unlikely to cause damage to the speaker. Electrostatic speakers are more accurately rated by voltage, not power. In the ESL's case, at the rated nominal impedance of 16 ohms, the limit of 33 volts would be reached when the amplifier's power output reaches 15 watts (if it were driving a conventional load).|$|E
5|$|One change {{made during}} {{production}} was augmented pitch control to avoid deep stall conditions at high angles of attack. The stall issue {{had been raised}} during development, but had originally been discounted. Model tests of the YF-16 conducted by the Langley Research Center revealed a potential problem, but no other laboratory was able to duplicate it. YF-16 flight tests were not sufficient to expose the issue; later flight testing on the FSD aircraft demonstrated {{there was a real}} concern. In response, the areas of the horizontal stabilizer were increased 25% on the Block 15 aircraft in 1981 and later retrofitted to earlier aircraft. In addition, a manual override switch to disable the horizontal stabilizer flight limiter was prominently placed on the control console, allowing the pilot to regain control of the horizontal stabilizers (which the flight <b>limiters</b> otherwise lock in place) and recover. Besides reducing the risk of deep stalls, the larger horizontal tail also improved stability and permitted faster takeoff rotation.|$|E

25|$|FM {{provides}} improved Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), {{as compared}} for example with AM. Compared with an optimum AM scheme, FM typically has poorer SNR below a certain signal level called the noise threshold, but above {{a higher level}} – the full improvement or full quieting threshold – the SNR is much improved over AM. The improvement depends on modulation level and deviation. For typical voice communications channels, improvements are typically 5-15dB. FM broadcasting using wider deviation can achieve even greater improvements. Additional techniques, such as pre-emphasis of higher audio frequencies with corresponding de-emphasis in the receiver, are generally used to improve overall SNR in FM circuits. Since FM signals have constant amplitude, FM receivers normally have <b>limiters</b> that remove AM noise, further improving SNR.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to curb the {{increasing}} engine power levels of recent years, the maximum engine displacement was reduced from 3.0 to 2.4 litres {{and the number of}} cylinders from 10 to 8. At similar engine speeds, the change was expected to cut peak power by around 200bhp, which would equate to around three to five seconds on lap times at most circuits. (Scuderia Toro Rosso continued to use 3.0 litre 10-cylinder engines with both rev and air-intake <b>limiters</b> to avoid the costs of re-engineering their cars in a short period). Initial testing indicated the new engines were six seconds slower than their V10 counterparts, but early in the season it became obvious that despite the decrease in power, lap times were not far from 2005 figures; on some circuits, the fastest laps set this year were actually faster than the ones recorded last year, with the V10 engines.|$|E
500|$|The FLCC further {{incorporates}} <b>limiters</b> governing {{movement in}} the three main axes based on attitude, airspeed and angle of attack (AOA); these prevent control surfaces from inducing instability such as slips or skids, or a high AOA inducing a stall.

Flight testing has revealed that [...] "assaulting" [...] multiple <b>limiters</b> at high AOA and low speed can result in an AOA far exceeding the 25° limit, colloquially referred to as [...] "departing"; this causes a deep stall; a near-freefall at 50° to 60° AOA, either upright or inverted.

A three-dimensional heat transfer calculation taking the radiation loss from the surface into account was conducted to find out the factors governing the heat flux onto the test <b>limiter.</b> The result for the Ta test <b>limiter</b> shows that the experimentally observed temperature asymmetry in the toroidal direction can be explained if the plasma heat flux decreases exponentially from the last closed flux surface with the e-folding length of the ion drift side about 50 % longer than that of the electron drift side. The intensity of D-beta light around the ion drift side of the <b>limiter</b> was larger than that at the electron drift side by about 30 %, corresponding with a larger particle flux to the ion drift side.
