Soon she becomes frightened after Tigerstar discusses his plans to rule the forest with his Clanmates, including hiring BloodClan and setting a pack of dogs on ThunderClan. Extremely scared and changing her mind, Sasha flees, but before she can get far she is approached by Tigerstar who asks if she will join ShadowClan.|$|E
5|$|Victorious after {{defeating}} the King in the war, Meliara returns to Tlanth {{to improve its}} dilapidated castle with the family's new riches. One day, Bran visits her, accompanied by his new fiance Lady Nimiar Argaliar and the Marquis of Shevraeth, who is preparing to take the throne of Remalna. Now accustomed to the fine fashions of court, Bran expresses dismay at finding Mel dressed in old clothes - she never before cared about her appearance. Mel becomes shy and embarrassed about her lack of courtly finesse and grace, and avoids the visitors, especially Shevraeth, who she fears <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> her. Nimiar convinces Mel to return with them to court, and begins to teach her the essential of life there, including its customs, clothing styles, and hand fan language.|$|E
5|$|In the foreground, {{a drunken}} freemason, {{identified}} by his apron and set square medallion as the Worshipful Master of a lodge, is being helped home by his Tyler, as {{the contents of}} a chamber pot are emptied onto his head from a window. In some of the prints, a woman standing back from the window <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> him, suggesting that his soaking is not accidental. The freemason is traditionally identified as Sir Thomas de Veil, {{who was a member of}} Hogarth's first Lodge, Henry Fielding's predecessor as the Bow Street magistrate, and the model for Fielding's character Justice Squeezum in The Coffee-House Politician (1730). He was unpopular for his stiff sentencing of gin-sellers, which was deemed to be hypocritical as he was known to be an enthusiastic drinker. He is supported by his Tyler, a servant equipped with sword and candle-snuffer, who may be Brother Montgomerie, the Grand Tyler.|$|E

5|$|The way the {{painting}} shows {{the progress of}} time is also without precedent in Western art. The death of a blameless victim had typically been presented as a conclusive episode, imbued with the virtue of heroism. The Third of May offers no such cathartic message. Instead, there is a continuous procession of the condemned in a mechanical formalization of murder. The inevitable outcome {{is seen in the}} corpse of a man, splayed {{on the ground in the}} lower left portion of the work. There is no room left for the sublime; his head and body have been disfigured to a degree that renders resurrection impossible. The victim is portrayed bereft of all aesthetic or spiritual grace. For the rest of the picture the viewer's eye level is mostly along the central horizontal axis; only here is the perspectival point of view changed, so that the viewer <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the mutilated body.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{is invited}} by her boss Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) to spend Christmas {{with him to}} help him deal with a visit from his mother, Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch). Liz finds it strange that Jack's fiancée Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) will not spend the holiday with him and {{immediately}} realizes that Jack has not told his mother about Avery's pregnancy. Avery becomes angry, but she and Liz convince him to tell her which he promises to do. Jack tells Colleen about the news {{but she is not}} excited about the pregnancy as Jack and Avery are not married. To get back at her, Jack calls his biological father Milton Greene (Alan Alda), the father she never told him he had, and invites him to spend Christmas with him, and does not inform him that Colleen will be present. The next day, Milton arrives and Jack explains the reason for his visit is so that he can ambush Colleen as she <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> his relationship with Avery. Later, Avery arrives and is angered about what Colleen said about her relationship with Jack. Liz tries to warn Colleen about Jack's plan but to no avail. She is shocked to see Milton, but immediately figures out what Jack is up to. Colleen gets even with Jack by faking a heart attack, which causes Milton and Avery to feel sorry for her thus abandoning their plan to reprimand Colleen. At the hospital, Avery reveals that she and Jack had planned to elope over New Year's and extends an invitation to everyone. After the announcement, Liz leaves and travels to White Haven, Pennsylvania to spend Christmas with her family.|$|E

Thornton sees Margaret and Frederick together, and assumes {{that he is}} her lover. Leonards, a man from Helstone, later recognises Frederick at the train station. They argue; Frederick pushes Leonards away, and Leonards dies shortly afterwards. When the police question Margaret about the scuffle she lies and says she was not present. As the magistrate investigate Leonards' death, Thornton knows that Margaret lied but declares the case closed to save her from possible perjury.

25|$|In 1972 Brel {{appeared}} in his eighth feature film, Le Bar de la fourche (The bar at the crossing), directed by Alain Levent and co-starring Rosy Varte and Isabelle Huppert. Brel plays Vincent Van Horst, a hard-drinking bon vivant who loves his freedom and his women. In 1916 he leaves Europe, which is torn apart by the war, and moves to Canada, intending {{to meet up with}} Maria, the only woman he ever loved. On the way to Canada, he meets a young boy who dreams about fighting in the European war. When Vincent arrives at the Bar de la Fourche, managed by Maria, he finds her looking older.

25|$|Graham and Doubletop mountains, Balsam Lake's higher {{neighbors to}} the east, {{dominate}} {{the view from the}} fire tower, with Slide, the highest Catskill peak, between them in clear weather. In the best of conditions the Blackhead Range at the northeast corner of the Catskills is visible as well. To the north Dry Brook Ridge appears as a single peak rather than a long ridge, with Bearpen, highest peak in New York outside the Forest Preserve, visible in clear weather. Westward Woodpecker Ridge and the eastern summit of Mill Brook Ridge are closest, and in the distance the view <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the lower peaks in eastern Delaware County, with Mount Pisgah, home to Ski Bobcat, standing out above most of them. South the view takes in the Beaver Kill Range, with Peekamoose, Table and Red Hill and its fire tower also visible. In clear weather the Shawangunk Ridge is also visible to the southeast, and Elk Mountain, highest peak in Northeastern Pennsylvania, is on the southwest horizon.|$|E
25|$|In {{the ancient}} Celtic world Anu {{was the mother}} goddess and {{considered}} to be the mother of all the gods; the Tuatha de Danann. Other references say that she is the mother earth goddess or the Goddess of fertility. On the Cork Kerry border are two mountains called the Paps of Anu (pap is another word for breast.) On the top of each mountain are stone structures or cairns that when viewed from a distance make the two mountains look like a pair of breasts. Anu was known, in the Celtic World, by several similar names: Danu or Don being the most popular alternatives. She was a Mother-Goddess, the wife of the Sun God, Belenos, and {{considered to be the}} ancestor of all the Gods, the Tuatha dé Danann, who found themselves obliged to reside in the Otherworld when Miled brought the Celts to the British Isles. She still <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> us from the night's sky where she appears as Llys Don, better known as the constellation of Casseopeia.|$|E

500|$|The {{continued}} admiration that Leonardo commanded from painters, {{critics and}} historians {{is reflected in}} many other written tributes.
