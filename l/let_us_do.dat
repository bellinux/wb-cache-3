500|$|Yancey’s {{speaking}} tour {{in favor}} of Breckinridge was {{not confined to the}} South. In Wilmington, Delaware, Yancey stated, [...] "We stand upon the dark platform of southern slavery, and all we ask is to be allowed to keep it to ourselves. <b>Let</b> <b>us</b> <b>do</b> that, and we will not let the negro [...] insult you by coming here and marrying your daughters." ...|$|E

So much so that Marvel greenlit an 8th issue for us. I came up with a better ending but needed the pages. Very grateful that they <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>do</b> our thing." [...] The delay also caused the remaining issues to be pushed back with issue #8 being released in December 2016.|$|E
500|$|On 1 September 1965 Atrash was {{appointed}} Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), but acquired little de facto power {{because of the}} Military Committee's overarching control, with Atrash later remarking [...] "the officers <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>do</b> the talking although, as we later discovered, they had agreed beforehand... what the decisions would be." [...] The RCC {{played the role of}} parliament and Atrash was its speaker. In December tensions between the National Command (loyal to Aflaq and Bitar) and the Regional Command (loyal to Jadid and backed by the military) grew worse as elements of the former attempted to align with Military Committee member Muhammad Umran in an effort to split the military's support (and according to Syria expert Itamar Rabinovich, the Alawite officers' solid backing) of Jadid. However, Atrash, along with Munif al-Razzaz of Jordan and Jubran al-Majdalani and Ali al-Khalil of Lebanon, {{was a part of the}} group in the National Command that opposed confrontation with the Regional Command, citing the National Command's lack of military support and political power as well as the fundamental weakness of an alliance with Umran and Amin al-Hafiz. The latter two had been engaged in an antagonistic rivalry over leadership of the Military Committee.|$|E
500|$|After {{the large}} {{success of the}} demo version, Yankovic wanted to put the song {{on one of his}} albums. However, the immensely complex process of getting {{permission}} from George Lucas and the publishers of the Kinks' [...] "Lola" [...] delayed the release of the song for about five years. Eventually, after Lucas gave Yankovic permission, the song's publishers turned Al down. [...] Several versions of why the parody was turned down exist. In a 1985 interview with Spin, Yankovic explained that, [...] "We approached Ray Davies , we've been approaching him every year and a half, two years before each album comes out and he's always been a little skeptical, a little afraid because 'Lola' was a very personal song for him. Then just out of the blue he decided this time to <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] However, the liner notes to the [...] present a different story. According to the album's notes, the song may have remained unreleased for some time {{had it not been for}} a chance encounter Yankovic had with the song's original songwriter, Ray Davies. When Yankovic asked why he hadn't given him permission, Davies remarked that he had never been asked. Davies immediately gave Yankovic permission to record the song, and the song was later released on Dare to Be Stupid.|$|E

500|$|The series {{initially}} gained {{interest from}} major terrestrial networks {{such as the}} BBC and ITV. However, Max Beesley and Philip Glenister grew frustrated with the comments from the commissioning teams from the networks. Glenister stated that [...] "the problem with the BBC and ITV is more people coming in and telling you what to do; we are grown up and big enough {{to know where the}} boundaries are". They ultimately settled for Sky, as the network was [...] "the one that we believed would <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>do</b> what we wanted". In January 2012, Glenister believed their decision to go with Sky was [...] "vindicated", as the terrestrial networks would restrict its content, violence, and language. He stated that the restrictions would not make the series [...] "the show it is and it wouldn't be the show we wanted to make". Head of Sky Drama Elaine Pyke had an immediate interest in the project, as she was [...] "immediately grabbed by how thrilling, scary, and funny it is", believing it to be [...] "the perfect show for Sky1". In a separate interview, Beesley stated: [...] "Andy Harries basically put the show out to a few of the networks and Sky said, 'Here's the money, go and make it and we'll give you notes later on, but really do have the freedom to make it,' which is great, and there's not a lot of that happens nowadays." ...|$|E

2500|$|Matchee and Brown, both {{members of}} 2 Commando, then {{proceeded}} to beat Arone. Matchee used a ration pack to beat the youth, {{as well as a}} broomstick, and sodomised the teenager with it. Brown participated in the abuse, but was primarily an observer and took sixteen [...] "trophy photos" [...] of the beating, including one of Matchee forcing Arone's mouth open with a baton, and one of himself holding Pte. David Brocklebank's loaded pistol to Arone's head. At approximately 23:20, Master Cpl. Giasson entered the bunker, Matchee showed him Arone, who was now semi-conscious and bleeding, and boasted that [...] "in Canada we cannot do that, and here they <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>do</b> it".|$|E

5000|$|Bamber {{wrote the}} {{foreword}} for Titan Books' Battlestar Galactica: The Official Companion Season Three by David Bassom. Of the show's dramatic resonance, he said: ...that's what good drama <b>lets</b> <b>us</b> <b>do.</b> It allows <b>us</b> {{to see and}} to feel things we otherwise would not. And great drama allows <b>us</b> to <b>do</b> that on every level: the psychological, the personal and the political.

60|$|But, happily for us, the Spirit lusts {{against the}} flesh. It draws us the {{opposite}} way. It lifts us up, instead of dragging us down. It has nobler aims, higher longings.
