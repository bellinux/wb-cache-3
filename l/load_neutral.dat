For work hardening materials the question as to whether plastic deformation occurs during <b>neutral</b> <b>loading</b> depends strongly upon the deformation produced from initial loading.

However, when plastic strain is produced from initial loading then plastic flow is produced from a subsequent stress path that follows the boundary of a surface that is an isotropic expansion of the initial yield surface. Since this violates the assumption of isotropic hardening the usefulness and limitations of the rule of kinematic hardening are examined.

We examined neural circuitry supporting emotion regulation in females with either BDd or UDd as a first stage toward identifying biomarkers that may differentiate BDd from UDd. METHOD: Fifty-seven females aged 18 - 45 years participated in this study: 23 with UDd, 18 with bipolar disorder type I depression (BDId) and 16 healthy females. During 3 -T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the participants performed an emotional face n-back (EFNBACK) task, that is an n-back task with high (2 -back) and low (0 -back) memory load conditions flanked by two positive, negative or neutral face distracters. This paradigm examines executive control with emotional distracters-emotion regulation. RESULTS: High memory <b>load</b> with <b>neutral</b> face distracters elicited greater bilateral and left dorsal anterior midcingulate cortex (dAMCC) activity in UDd than in healthy and BDId females respectively, and greater bilateral putamen activity in both depressed groups versus healthy females. High memory load with happy face distracters elicited greater left putamen activity in UDd than in healthy females. Psychotropic medication was associated with greater putamen activity to these contrasts in UDd females. CONCLUSIONS: During high memory <b>load</b> with <b>neutral</b> face distracters, elevated dAMCC activity in UDd suggests abnormal recruitment of attentional control circuitry to maintain task performance, whereas elevated putamen activity unrelated to psychotropic medication in BDId females may suggest an attentional bias toward ambiguous neutral face distracters.
