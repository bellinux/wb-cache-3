This method analytically specifies a loading trajectory in a space of active and reactive components of nodal voltages {{in the form of}} a convergent power series whose coefficients are determined using the curvilinear descent method. The computa-tional cost to calculate each coefficient in this series is equivalent to the computational cost of completing one iteration of the modified Newton method.

30|$|It {{is noted}} that two common methodologies {{are used to}} {{estimate}} the fuel flow rate of commercial aircraft, namely, the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) and Boeing Fuel Flow methods.

In the Boeing method, fuel flow data from the ICAO emission databank, which are calibrated to temperature and pressure ratios to obtain corrected fuel flows for the related cruise altitude and engine power, are used. However, since each method is based on fuel flow estimates considering relatively <b>limited</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions,</b> there exists the potential for high levels of error.

A decrease in the pressure drop of nearly 40 % was thus achieved. The concentration profile at the outlet was also substantially smoothened using an arrangement of the branch paths of the mixer that reduced the differences among the arrival times of the mixture through increased upstream spacing of the branch paths. The performance of the TDM was sufficiently optimized to make it commercially viable...|$|R

The MITR-II is designed to operate at 5 thermal megawatts. The MITR-I was shutdown in May, 1974, dismantling, construction, and preoperational testing continued until the MITR-II went critical on August 14, 1975. Cadmium absorbers were fixed in the upper core of the first fuel loadings to shorten the active core height and provide reactivity control. Solid non-fueled elements were also loaded for additional reactivity control. Swelling of the original cadmium fixed absorbers necessitated a second core configuration. The second core contained additional solid non-fueled elements and no fixed absorbers. The compact core of the MITR-II causes thermal neutron flux and power peaking to occur at the core outer boundaries and incore locations with excess moderator. The active core power density is in the!  range of 100 to 150 watts/cm 3 with peaks up to 300 watts/cm 3.
