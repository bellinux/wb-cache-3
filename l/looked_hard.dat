2500|$|Edgar Cayce {{was born}} on March 18, 1877, near Beverly, south of Hopkinsville, Kentucky. He was one of six {{children}} of farmers Carrie and Leslie B. Cayce. [...] As a child he played with the 'little folk' and was alleged to have seen his deceased grandfather. He regarded them all as incorporeal because he could see through them if he <b>looked</b> <b>hard</b> enough. [...] However, he found {{it very difficult to}} keep his mind on his lessons at school.|$|E
2500|$|The Handley Page Type E tandem seat {{monoplane}} {{was begun}} {{in the hope of}} winning a War Office competition late in 1911, but the specifications <b>looked</b> <b>hard</b> to meet, so it was decided to complete the machine as a demonstrator and submit a new design (the Type F) for the military prize. [...] The Type E had a good deal in common with its smaller, single-seat predecessor, the Type D. [...] Both were single-engined high-wing aircraft with the characteristic wing plan inherited from the Jos√© Weiss patent. [...] Less technically, both the wings and tails of both machines were varnished yellow, though the fabric-covered fuselage of the Type E was doped bright blue in contrast to the dull grey finish of the Type D. [...] Unsurprisingly, the Type E also inherited the name Yellow Peril.|$|E

60|$|The {{stranger}} <b>looked</b> <b>hard</b> at {{the captain}}, {{and the captain}} <b>looked</b> <b>hard</b> at the stranger, the obscurity rendering a pretty close scrutiny necessary, to enable either to distinguish features.
