40|$|After {{years of}} education, many people enter the {{workforce}} without the team-working skills fundamental in today's innovation economy. As {{one of the}} primary goals of education is to prepare students for the workforce, a shift from individual learning to collaborative learning is recommended. One way to incorporate collaborative learning in formal education is through students' engagement in the collaborative development of plays. When understanding of collaboration is achieved, according the theories of Teaching for Understanding, the <b>learner</b> <b>can</b> <b>apply</b> knowledge outside of the domain in which it was learned. Team-based management in business and collaborative playbuilding in theatre share congruent structural principles, therefore, the application of knowledge from one domain to the other is natural. This study investigated how university students came to understand collaboration through involvement in a Collaborative Play Development course. Findings support the recognition of collaborative theatre as an opportunity to develop marketable skills for the learners...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is based on}} the following research question: What are the pupils’ thoughts about their gaming habits and possible learning situations in connection with their gaming? The study is based on literature on the subject and on two interviews with five youths who are between sixteen and seventeen years of age. The conclusions that can be drawn from my research question are: - Learning could take place in different domains and be put into different contexts. Hence, language learnt from playing video games, could be applied on domains outside of the game, i. e. implicit learning in terms of using a foreign language when communicating with other players can become tacit knowledge that the <b>learner</b> <b>can</b> <b>apply</b> on settings outside of the game. Also, social skills learnt from the structure of a game like World of Warcraft {{can be used in a}} formal educational setting. As a video game is multimodal in its nature there are benefits from also using other multimodal material in formal education, as many of the pupils are familiar and used to the same sort of text. - There are also problems connected to informal learning. The informants in this study describe how their interest in video games often clashes with their formal education. Another aspect is of course how the quality of the content learnt within an informal setting is being supervised, in contrast to how the formal education works with a trained teacher and a set curriculum that carefully explains how the learning should become available for the learner. Finally, one of the informants explains how his writing skills has become worse because of his informal training of English, since he wants to use smilies and abbreviations in formal text writing...|$|E

30|$|Kinshuk et al. (2016) applies a third {{perspective}} {{focusing on}} ‘smarter pedagogies,’ stating that smart learning {{goes beyond the}} technology; when learning environments make effective use of advanced smart technologies, teaching methods and learning strategies must adapt and change. In this light, some researchers define smart learning emphasizing new pedagogies needed for learners to effectively integrate technology. For example, Sung (2015) describes smart learning to be “a humanistic approach to learning that offers hands-on and personalized opportunities to acquire information, manage knowledge, interact, and collaborate with peers and instructors so that <b>learners</b> <b>can</b> <b>apply</b> their knowledge and skills to solve problems and achieve goals in an authentic context” (p. 116). Noh et al.

Kinshuk et al. (2016) describe smart learning environments to provide seamless, real-time, and ongoing evidence of change in student knowledge as they navigate both formal and informal learning contexts.|$|R

40|$|Research {{suggests}} that pronunciation instruction {{should be developed}} and taught in the second language classroom (Derwing 2 ̆ 6 Munro, 2005; Elliott, 1997; Simões, 1996) {{in order to facilitate}} intelligible and comprehensible utterances in the L 2 (Derwing 2 ̆ 6 Munro, 1997). Although accentedness does not always create intelligibility issues, it can be the catalyst to negative native speaker perceptions of second language learners 2 ̆ 7 speech (Derwing 2 ̆ 6 Munro, 2009). One distinctive marker of accent among native speakers of English and Spanish is the duration of aspiration values for the voiceless plosives /p/ /t/ /k/ (Lord, 2005). The present study proposes the use of visual feedback treatments to aid native speakers of American English in producing more target-like realizations of /p/ /t/ /k/ in Spanish. Generalizability between treatments was also measured in order to observe whether or not second language <b>learners</b> <b>can</b> <b>apply</b> their knowledge to non-focus phonemes, as well as from words in a carrier phrase to various, longer types of speech. Results conclude that the Experimental group improved significantly in each elicitation task from the Pre-test to the Post-test. Responses to an attitudes survey also determine that participants favor a combination of explicit instruction and visual feedback. This study concludes that learners are able to generalize pronunciation knowledge of tokens in a carrier phrase to longer discourse, as well as from focus to non-focus phonemes. ...|$|R

40|$|Graduate {{students}} 2 ̆ 7 {{motivation to}} share their knowledge and research with K- 12 audiences as future scientists is informed by their beliefs and perceived value of science literacy outreach. Graduate training programs in academia integrate outreach teaching components to equip future scientists {{with a variety of}} communication skills, which may reflect either a transmission of knowledge to the learner or through engagement with the learner. As such, the education component of the 2 ̆ 2 Partnership for Research and Education in Plant Breeding and Genetics 2 ̆ 2 grant sought to train graduate plant science students (N = 17) to disseminate their research to K- 12 audiences. Graduate students participated in outreach teacher training using Learner-Centered Teaching (LCT) strategies to develop and conduct two science lessons for K- 12 audiences in a non-formal and formal educational settings. The purpose of this mixed methods study was to describe the outreach teaching beliefs and values of plant science graduate students after receiving the outreach training. The researcher used a deductive approach to analyze and triangulate multiple data sources, including teaching self-efficacy questionnaires, LCT knowledge tests, reflection essays, and semi-structured interviews. ^ The research study was conceptualized into three phases (i. e., course instruction and teaching experiences; follow-up questionnaire and interviews; triangulation) of a multistrand design and resulted in three major conclusions. First, plant science graduate students valued learning how to engage with K- 12 audiences using active learning. Graduate students 2 ̆ 7 expressed values of the following qualities: (a) how <b>learners</b> <b>can</b> <b>apply</b> knowledge to emerging agricultural issues, (b) how professors (i. e., graduate students as teachers) coach and facilitate, intertwining teaching and assessing, and (c) how to engage with learners actively by providing useful and timely feedback. Second, graduate students described field-based teaching experiences within formal and non-formal educational settings that helped them practice communication skills and develop their teaching self-efficacy. In this study, graduate students valued the following elements of a field-based experience: (a) participation in planning the experience, (b) selection of the learners by age and grade level demographics, and (c) multiple visits to teach the selected group of students. And third, graduate students described an enjoyment of teaching K- 12 audiences and the K- 12 experience was useful in preparing them to communicate science to technical and non-technical audiences. Graduate students 2 ̆ 7 reflections of enjoyment were referenced with recognition to the sense of autonomy that the graduate students achieved throughout their learning experiences. Moreover, graduate students recognized the transferability of the knowledge and skills from the integrated learning experience for their academic and career endeavors. As graduate-level academic programs continue to adjust and adapt to prepare plant science graduate students {{to meet the needs of}} an ever changing society, the following implications are discussed: acquiring (LCT) teaching skills to communicate science literacy, benefits of K- 12 audience field-based experiences, the opportunity to use a constructivist approach to assist learners in facilitating science outreach and implications for policy. ...|$|R
