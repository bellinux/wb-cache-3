5|$|A photon {{is a type}} of {{elementary}} particle, the quantum of the electromagnetic field including electromagnetic radiation such as <b>light,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> force carrier for the electromagnetic force (even when static via virtual particles). The photon has zero rest mass and always moves {{at the speed of light}} within a vacuum.|$|E
5|$|According to Jain texts, Mahavira's nirvana (death) {{occurred}} {{in the town of}} Pawapuri (Bihar). His life as a spiritual <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> night of his nirvana is remembered by Jains as Diwali on the same night that Hindus celebrate their festival of lights. On the night that Mahavira died, his chief disciple Gautama is said to have attained omniscience.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence occurs widely among animals, {{especially}} in the open sea, including fish, jellyfish, comb jellies, crustaceans, and cephalopod molluscs; in some fungi and bacteria; and in various terrestrial invertebrates including insects. About 76% of the main taxa of deep-sea animals produce light. Most marine light-emission is in the blue and green light spectrum. However, some loose-jawed fish emit red and infrared <b>light,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> genus Tomopteris emits yellow light.|$|E

5|$|By that time, Reinitzer had {{discovered}} and described three important features of cholesteric liquid crystals (the name coined by Otto Lehmann in 1904): {{the existence of}} two melting points, the reflection of circularly polarized <b>light,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ability to rotate the polarization direction of light.|$|E
5|$|Closely {{related to}} light {{deflection}} is the gravitational time delay (or Shapiro delay), the phenomenon that light signals {{take longer to}} move through a gravitational field than they would {{in the absence of}} that field. There have been numerous successful tests of this prediction. In the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism (PPN), measurements of both the deflection of <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gravitational time delay determine a parameter called γ, which encodes the influence of gravity on the geometry of space.|$|E

5|$|Gateshead International Stadium (GIS) is a multi-purpose, all-seater venue in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, England. Originally {{known as}} the Gateshead Youth Stadium, the venue was built in 1955 {{at a cost of}} £30,000. It has since been {{extensively}} re-developed on three occasions. Its capacity of around 11,800 is the greatest in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, the third-largest in Tyne and Wear (behind only St James' Park and the Stadium of <b>Light)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sixth-largest in North East England.|$|E

5|$|In 1970, a {{freestanding}} skeleton tower {{replaced the}} <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> vacant lighthouse was soon vandalized.

A caretaker continued {{to live in the}} old lighthouse until 2003, when it became too dilapidated. In 1991, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

5|$|As {{the closest}} planet to Earth, Venus {{has been a}} prime target for early interplanetary exploration. It was the first planet beyond Earth visited by a {{spacecraft}} (Mariner 2 in 1962), {{and the first to}} be successfully landed on (by Venera 7 in 1970). Venus's thick clouds render observation of its surface impossible in visible <b>light,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first detailed maps did not emerge until the arrival of the Magellan orbiter in 1991. Plans have been proposed for rovers or more complex missions, but they are hindered by Venus's hostile surface conditions.|$|E
5|$|On August 4, Governor General Manuel Macías y Casado sent Colonel Pedro del Pino {{and about}} 220 troops, {{including}} civil guardsmen {{to recapture the}} city. When Colonel Pino entered Fajardo on August 7, he found it nearly deserted because the residents, fearing a battle, had fled to the Fajardo <b>Light</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> surrounding hills. At close to midnight on August 8, Pino's troops began their assault on the lighthouse. The landing party of Amphitrite's sailors occupying the lighthouse doused the light and signaled the ships offshore, initiating shore bombardment as the naval guns began firing a protective pattern. After two hours, the Spanish forces retreated back to the town. The Americans suffered no casualties, despite a close call when a wayward naval shell smashed through the 2-foot thick walls of the lighthouse within touch of 6 men but failed to explode. The Spanish losses were 2 dead and 3 wounded, including a lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|Regardless, on 1 April, Operation Pegasus began. Opposition {{from the}} North Vietnamese was <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> primary problem that {{hampered}} the advance was continual heavy morning cloud cover that slowed {{the pace of}} helicopter operations. As the relief force made progress, the Marines at Khe Sanh moved out from their positions and began patrolling at greater distances from the base. Things heated up for the air cavalrymen on 6 April, when the 3rd Brigade encountered an NVA blocking force and fought a day-long engagement.|$|E
