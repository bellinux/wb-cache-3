500|$|The band took {{a two-week}} hiatus between the European and Japanese {{legs of the}} tour, which began in May 1992. Minutes before the Chili Peppers were {{scheduled}} to perform in Tokyo, Frusciante refused to go on stage, claiming he quit the band. After {{half an hour of}} coaxing, Frusciante agreed to play the show, though he asserted it would be his last. Kiedis recalled of the situation: [...] "It was the most horrible show ever. Every single note, every single word, hurt, knowing that we were no longer a band. I kept <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> John and seeing this dead statue of disdain... And that night, John disappeared from the topsy-turvy world of the Red Hot Chili Peppers." [...] The band hired guitarist Arik Marshall to complete the rest of the tour, which included Lollapolooza and several European festivals. Marshall, however, was fired {{at the end of the}} tour.|$|E
60|$|The {{friends of}} Mrs. Maybough had now reduced {{themselves}} to Wetmore, who sat beside her, <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the little tea-table group. Ludlow led the rest toward her.|$|E
6000|$|By {{this time}} they were leaning on the rail of the promenade, <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> what little was left of Long Island, and she said, abruptly: [...] "I think I will go and see how my father is getting along." ...|$|E
60|$|EILEEN (with {{a longing}} <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> Murray). But not to-day--please, Mrs. Turner.|$|R
60|$|Julien was {{a little}} staggered. She <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> him and laughed scornfully.|$|R
5000|$|Ballou <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> him and said, [...] "If {{you were}} a Universalist, the idea would never occur to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-bye, Little Jule," [...] cried Navy Bob, as we swept {{under the}} bows. [...] "Don't fall overboard, Ropey," [...] said another {{to the poor}} landlubber, who, with Wymontoo, the Dane, and others left behind, was <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> us from the forecastle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Overpowered by horrible fascination, I stood {{grasping}} the rail, and <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the water beneath me, as the vessel moved slowly and steadily onward, stern foremost. In {{spite of the}} upset condition of my mind, I could not help wondering why the Vessel should move in this way.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are great}} fighters," [...] Jorgenson observed, unconcernedly, {{spreading}} {{his elbows on}} the rail and <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the floating black patch of characteristic shape whence proceeded the voice of the wily envoy of Tengga. [...] "Each man of them is worth ten of such as you can find in the Settlement." ...|$|E
60|$|The lad hesitated, and <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> Lord Henry, who was {{watching}} them from the tea-table with an amused smile.|$|R
6000|$|... [HILLCRIST nods. [...] JILL <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> ROLF, {{whose face}} is [...] grimly set. CHLOE has never moved. MRS. HILLCRIST whispers to [...] her husband.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See, I {{have settled}} that matter for you satisfactorily," [...] said Mr Summers; [...] "there are the papers, {{which you can}} <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> your leisure." ...|$|R
6000|$|Half an {{hour later}} she thought it time to join the young people, urged largely by the frantic {{interest}} of her daughter. But she returned from the half-open door without entering. [...] "I couldn't bring myself to break in on the poor things. They are standing at the window together <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> St. George's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm {{just coming}} {{to live in}} New York," [...] March said, <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> Fulkerson, who had been {{watching}} his interview with the perfunctory smile of sympathy that people put on at the meeting of old friends. [...] "I want {{to introduce you to}} my friend Mr. Fulkerson. He and I are going into a literary enterprise here." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dorian said nothing, but {{rose from}} the table and, passing into the next room, sat down to the piano and let his fingers stray across the white and black ivory of the keys. After the coffee had been brought in, he stopped, and, <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> Lord Henry, said, [...] "Harry, did it ever occur to you that Basil was murdered?" ...|$|E
60|$|Sparrer stopped {{abruptly}} and gazed with unseeing eyes {{off through the}} forest aisles. Pat <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the youngster with the light of understanding in his eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course they}} look all right," [...] replied Jerry, [...] "but what I {{want to know}} is if they see all right. <b>Look</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> that bank." ...|$|R
60|$|Little Joe Otter <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the bank. He stared and stared, but he didn't see {{anything}} unusual. It looked {{just as it}} always did. He told Jerry Muskrat so.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Kybird started. [...] "Ah, and {{we notice}} it too, ma'am, at our age," [...] she said, sweetly, as she settled {{herself in her}} chair and clasped {{her hands in her lap}} [...] "I can't 'elp looking at you, my dear," [...] she continued, <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> Miss Nugent. [...] "There's such a {{wonderful}} likeness between Jack and you. Don't you think so, ma'am?" ...|$|E
60|$|Of course, {{this was}} evidently {{for the benefit}} of society, but it was {{certainly}} one of those cases where the poetical suffers for the practical. I comforted myself in my despondency, by <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the old stone piers underneath, which were indisputably the same. We drove now through beautiful grounds, and alighted at an elegant mansion, which in former days belonged to Lockhart, the son-in-law of Scott. It was in this house that Old Mortality was written.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! many's the time, miss," [...] Jane {{said with}} a sigh, <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the empty grate, [...] "you'd come down here to make cakes or puddings, and laugh and joke like a child with Mary an' me. I often {{used to say to}} Emily--her as was cook here before Ellen Smith,--'Miss Una's never so happy as when she's down here in the kitchen.' And 'That's true what you say,' says Emily to me, many a time and often." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lord Henry <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Erskine. [...] "Humanity takes itself too seriously. It is the world's {{original}} sin. If the caveman {{had known}} how to laugh, History would have been different." ...|$|R
50|$|In Mexico, {{the frog}} has been {{protected}} under the Mexican law. The Gunther's Robber Frog is need of conservation protection of their habitat {{and is being}} <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the State Omiltemi Park.|$|R
6000|$|... "And as I stood hearkening, dulcimers, haut-boys, and shawms, And violoncellos, and a three-stringed double-bass, Joined in, {{and were}} intermixed with a singing of psalms; And I <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the dead men's dwelling-place.|$|R
60|$|<b>Looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the back, {{between two}} of the sharp ridges of the roofs, he hung his rope so that it would fall across a window, {{fastened}} the end round a stack of chimneys, and then, taking hold of it, swung himself over. He had been very careful in tying the knots, and had tested them by pulling at them with all his strength; but he did not feel at all certain that they might not draw with his weight, in which case he must have been dashed to pieces on the ground far below him; but {{there was no time to}} hesitate, and, as fast as he could, he began to slide down the rope, the frequent knots affording good hold for his hands.|$|E
6000|$|Laurie colored up, but {{answered}} frankly, [...] "Why, you see I {{often hear}} you calling to one another, and when I'm alone up here, I can't help <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> your house, you {{always seem to}} be having such good times. I beg your pardon for being so rude, but sometimes you forget to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are. And when the lamps are lighted, it's like looking at a picture to see the fire, and you all around the table with your mother. Her face is right opposite, and it looks so sweet behind the flowers, I can't help watching it. I haven't got any mother, you know." [...] And Laurie poked the fire to hide a little twitching of the lips that he could not control.|$|E
60|$|Kenton went silently {{back to his}} book, {{which he}} took {{with him to the}} reading-room, where from time to time his wife came to him and {{reported}} that Ellen and Breckon were still walking up and down together, or that they were sitting down talking, or were forward, <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the prow, or were watching the deck-passengers dancing. Her husband received her successive advices with relaxing interest, and when she had brought the last she was aware that the affair was entirely in her hands with all the responsibility. After the gay parting between Ellen and Breckon, which took place late in the afternoon, she suffered an interval to elapse before she followed the girl down to her state-room. She found her lying in her berth, with shining eyes and glad, red cheeks; she was smiling to herself.|$|E
60|$|He yawned, {{his eyes}} closing. How sleepy he was! He <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the bed. Then {{he sat down}} on the edge of it and took his shoes off. So much to do, the next day.|$|R
60|$|Jean-Marie {{seemed to}} ponder for a while, {{and then he}} raised his head again and <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the Doctor with an air of candid inquiry. 'But are not you a very curious gentleman?' he asked.|$|R
6000|$|He didn't like it; and, {{clapping}} on his hat, he {{went out}} to learn what the matter was. He <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the house, up at the sky, down at the ground, and through the street; but nothing funny appeared, for Poppy and dolly were hidden again, and the old gentleman was puzzled. He went in and sat down to watch, feeling rather disturbed. Presently the fun began again: the children clapped their hands, the people laughed, and every one <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the house, in what he thought a very impertinent way. This made him angry; and out he rushed a second time, saying, as he marched across the street: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, woman, it is not." [...] And then, as Mr. Chaffanbrass {{raised his}} voice, {{and spoke with}} savage earnestness, Bridget again started, and gave a little leap up from the floor. But she soon settled herself back in her old position. [...] "No one has dared to accuse her of that," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Chaffanbrass, <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the lawyers on the other side. [...] "The charge they have brought forward against her is that of perjury--of having given false evidence twenty {{years ago in a}} court of law. Now look here, Bridget Bolster; look at me, I say." [...] She did look at him for a moment, and then turned her eyes back to the canopy. [...] "As sure as you're a living woman, you shall be placed there and tried for the same offence,--for perjury,--if you tell me a falsehood respecting this matter." ...|$|E
60|$|He went on, drawing nearer and nearer. At length he {{came out}} upon the broad and {{beautiful}} quay, with large and elegant stone buildings {{on one side of}} it, and a broad but low parapet wall on the other, separating the quay from the water. There was a sidewalk along this wall, with many people walking on it; and here and there men were to be seen leaning upon the wall, and <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the boats on the river. The river was broad, and it flowed very rapidly, as almost all water does which has just come from Switzerland and the Alps. On looking up and down, Rollo saw a great number of bridges crossing this stream, with teams and diligences, and in one place a long troop of soldiers passing over. On the other side, the bank was lined with massive blocks of stone buildings. In a word, the whole scene presented a very bright and animated spectacle to view.|$|E
60|$|Have we not {{all such}} closets, my jolly friend, {{as well as}} the noble Marquis of Carabas? At night, when all the house is asleep but you, don't you get up and peep into yours? When you in your turn are slumbering, up gets Mrs. Brown from your side, steals downstairs like Amina to her ghoul, clicks open the secret door, and looks into her dark depository. Did she tell you of that little affair with Smith long before she knew you? Psha! who knows any one save himself alone? Who, in showing his house to the closest and dearest, doesn't keep back the key of a closet or two? I think of a lovely reader laying down the page and <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> her {{unconscious}} husband, asleep, perhaps, after dinner. Yes, madam, a closet he hath: and you, who pry into everything, shall never have the key of it. I think of some honest Othello pausing over this very sentence in a railroad carriage, and stealthily gazing at Desdemona opposite to him, innocently administering sandwiches to their little boy--I am trying to turn off the sentence with a joke, you see--I feel it is growing too dreadful, too serious.|$|E
6000|$|The {{captain said}} nothing to Alan, but he <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> me with an ugly look. [...] "David," [...] said he, [...] "I'll mind this"; {{and the sound of}} his voice went through me with a jar.|$|R
