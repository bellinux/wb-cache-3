5|$|The {{development}} team {{planned to}} distinguish The Last Remnant from the Final Fantasy series and other role-playing games through {{its focus on}} the battle system. The art direction of the game was focused on making all of the characters stand out on the battlefield, and in making the Remnants stand {{out in the world}} screens. The cities were designed to not look very fantastical, so as to make the Remnants more prominent, and were designed early on in the development process {{to give the impression that}} the people of the city were living both <b>literally</b> <b>and</b> <b>figuratively</b> under the power of the gigantic Remnants. The game marked several firsts for Square Enix, as it was their first game to be released on the same day in both Japan and internationally, as well as the first to use motion captures of Western actors. This resulted in the characters' lips speaking English synced to the spoken dialogue, rather than Japanese. The game had always been intended to be released simultaneously worldwide and was to be targeted to players worldwide, which impacted the character design and art direction. The design and dialogue were created to appeal to international players as well as Japanese players, rather than being focused on the norms of the Japanese video game market alone.|$|E
5|$|The first {{element in}} the scheme of painted {{architecture}} is a definition of the real architectural elements by accentuating the lines where spandrels and pendentives intersect with the curving vault. Michelangelo painted these as decorative courses that look like sculpted stone moldings. These have two repeating motifs, a formula common in Classical architecture. Here, one motif is the acorn, the symbol of the family of both Pope Sixtus IV, who built the chapel, and Pope Julius II, who commissioned Michelangelo's work. The other motif is the scallop shell, one of the symbols of the Madonna, to whose assumption the chapel was dedicated in 1483. The crown of the wall then rises above the spandrels, to a strongly projecting painted cornice that runs right around the ceiling, separating the pictorial areas of the biblical scenes from the figures of Prophets, Sibyls, and Ancestors, who <b>literally</b> <b>and</b> <b>figuratively</b> support the narratives. Ten broad painted crossribs of travertine cross the ceiling and divide it into alternately wide and narrow pictorial spaces, a grid that gives all the figures their defined place.|$|E

The main source of contention was the relatively great expense of this public transport development in the Auckland Region, where for many decades the focus had been on private vehicle ownership and travel.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{endeavours}} {{to elucidate}} the phrase εἰς λόγον δόσεως καὶ λήμψεως {{found in the}} letter of the apostle Paul to the Christian community at Philippi, Macedonia (Phil 4 : 15). By means of a detailed philological survey of each of these terms as they are appear in isolation or in collocation in ancient literary and documentary sources, it is demonstrated that the expression pertains to ancient accounting terminology. It is argued that, contrary to the communis opinio in New Testament scholarship, it should be understood <b>literally,</b> <b>and</b> not <b>figuratively.</b> It is finally concluded that the expression refers to the account of a missionary fund set up by Paul and his Philippian companions to finance his missionary activities. Thus, it constitutes the earliest piece of evidence of Christian financial accounting and organization. 16 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Recent event related brain {{potential}} (ERP) {{results show}} that figurative interpretations of proverbial phrases (e. g., lightning never strikes the same place twice) elicit sustained slow cortical potentials that are more negative over {{the front of the}} head than for literal interpretations of the same phrases (Ferretti, Schwint, & Katz, under review). We extend this research by examining the influence of explicit markers placed before the proverbs, such as <b>literally</b> speaking <b>and</b> <b>figuratively</b> speaking, <b>and</b> by contrasting two literal conditions in which there either is overlap or no overlap between content words in the proverbs and the preceding contexts. The {{results show that}} slow cortical potentials were most negative for proverbs interpreted in figurative contexts, and most positive for literal contexts that contained overlapping words. Moreover, markers directed readers toward the contextually appropriate interpretation of the proverbs earlier than found in previous research. These findings have direct relevance for theoretical explanations of figurative language processing...|$|R

25|$|The Lords Chamber is {{the site}} of nationally {{televised}} ceremonies, the most important of which is the State Opening of Parliament, which is held formally to open each annual parliamentary session, either after a General Election or in the autumn. At this occasion every constitutional element of the government is represented: the Crown (both <b>literally,</b> <b>and</b> <b>figuratively</b> in the person of the Sovereign), The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and The Commons, (who together form the Legislature), the Judiciary (although no judges are members of either House of Parliament), and the Executive (both Government Ministers, and ceremonial military units in attendance on the Sovereign); and a large number of guests are invited to attend in the large Royal Gallery immediately outside the Chamber. The Sovereign, seated on the Throne, delivers the Speech from the Throne, outlining the Government's programme for the year and legislative agenda for the forthcoming parliamentary session. The Commons may not enter the Lords' debating floor; instead, they watch the proceedings from beyond the Bar of the House, just inside the door. A small purely formal ceremony is held to end each parliamentary session, when the Sovereign is merely represented by a group of Lords Commissioners.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{investigating}} the processing of idioms by native and non-native speakers. In particular, it seeks to discover {{whether there is a}} processing bias, either <b>literally</b> or <b>figuratively,</b> <b>and</b> whether native speakers and non-native speakers treat idioms in the same way. To do this, two experiments were run. The first experiment was a familiarity task, done by ten participants, in order to find materials for the second experiment. The idioms needed to be highly familiar to participants, and also to occur in either both first languages or neither. Using these idioms, a processing task was designed and run on 40 participants. This experiment found that there is a processing bias for idioms, either in literal or figurative context, for native speakers and that non-native speakers show a literal processing bias. Thus {{it can be argued that}} native speakers process idioms faster and do not rely overly on context; whereas non-native speakers first attempt a literal reading of idioms before rejecting it for a figurative one...|$|R

This means that while the jokes almost always go over, they can feel like cartoon captions instead of involuntary hiccups of personality. Then, of course, there's the matter of making speeches stageworthy that were devised for the confessional privacy of a television camera." ...|$|R

500|$|Farsari {{and other}} 19th-century {{commercial}} photographers generally concentrated on {{two types of}} subject matter: the scenery of Japan and the [...] "manners and customs" [...] of its inhabitants. Such subjects, {{and the ways in}} which they were <b>literally</b> <b>and</b> <b>figuratively</b> framed, were chosen to appeal to foreign taste; and the reason for this, apart from the photographer's individual aesthetics, vision and preconceptions, had much to do with economics. Photographs were expensive to make and accordingly expensive to buy. In 1870s Japan, a portrait photograph usually cost half a ryō [...] "per head", about a month's pay for an artisan. Given such pricing, few Japanese could afford photographs and a photographer's clientele was largely drawn from the foreign residents of the European and American enclaves: colonial administrators, missionaries, merchants and the military. By the early 1870s, tourists had joined their number. To appeal to this clientele, photographers often staged and contrived the scenes they photographed, particularly the portraits depicting [...] "manners and customs".|$|E

Le Guin makes another reference to Marvell's poetry at {{the conclusion}} of the story, which refers to the notion of a planetary consciousness. Marvell's poem [...] "The Garden" [...] speaks of [...] "a green thought in a green shade"; Le Guin describes World 4470 as [...] "one big green thought."

500|$|The Imperial {{court in}} Vienna criticized Daun for {{his failure to}} act; the Empress and her ministers worried that the Russians and the French would {{drop out of the}} {{coalition}} if there were no action. [...] Daun, a cautious and diligent commander, took his time to make his plans. The Strohmberg, one of the heights abutting Hochkirch, anchored Daun's left flank, and he deployed the remainder of his force southward across the road between Bautzen and Loebau. This also gave him control of an important junction between Görlitz in the east and Zittau in the south. He anchored the far right end of his line in another wooded hill south of the road, called the Kuppritzerberg. The Prussians neither increased their security nor deployed their troops in response to the Austrian presence. Daun also took into account that his men were eager to fight a battle and that they outnumbered the Prussians by more than two-to-one. His men made a great production of hewing the trees in a nearby forest, action which Frederick interpreted as efforts to create field works, not, as it was actually intended, to build a road through the thick wood. Daun also had discovered a secret weakness of Frederick's. His own personal secretary had been sending Frederick information on Daun's plans, secreted in deliveries of eggs; upon discovering this, Daun promised the man his life in return for his cooperation in continuing to send Frederick misinformation. Daun's plan, which he had kept secret, was an early morning sweep through the woods with 30,000 specially picked troops, around Frederick's flank, to enclose him.
