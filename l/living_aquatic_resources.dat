In {{this study we}} analyse historical fisheries and fish trade at the north-eastern Baltic Sea coast in the late 17 th century. Local consumption and export together amounted to the annual removal of about 200 tonnes of fish from the nearby sea and freshwater bodies. The fishery was very diverse and exploited altogether one cyclostome and 17 fish species with over 90 % of the catch being consumed locally. The exported fish consisted almost entirely of high-valued species with Stockholm (Sweden) being the most important export destination.

40|$|AbstractDespite being {{surrounded}} by <b>aquatic</b> <b>resources,</b> the Prehistoric populations of the North Atlantic Islands have a complex history of <b>aquatic</b> <b>resource</b> that until now has been little understood. Specifically the changing importance and uses of <b>aquatic</b> <b>resources</b> through time, {{and the role of}} <b>aquatic</b> <b>resources</b> in the management of animals in prehistory requires further attention. This paper presents results of faunal isotopic analysis in combination with existing human isotopic evidence and zooarchaeological datasets from Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age sites in the Western Isles (also known as the Outer Hebrides) and Orkney to explore the importance of <b>aquatic</b> <b>resources</b> in the lives of these prehistory populations. In Orkney coastal grazing was an important aspect in the management of sheep throughout prehistory, whereas in the Western Isles this was only evident in the Bronze Age. Aquatic protein was also used in the management of pigs in the Western Isles during the Middle Iron Age. There is little evidence of humans consuming <b>aquatic</b> <b>resources</b> in the Neolithic, and only minor evidence of consumption in the Bronze Age. During the Iron Age <b>aquatic</b> <b>resources</b> become more important in the diet of humans.

Data utilized were from 540 <b>aquatic</b> <b>resources</b> dependent households from 3 provinces gathered using household survey, longitudinal monitoring and {{participatory rural appraisal}} methods in 2003 and 2004. Among the major findings were: a) fishing was an important livelihood activity among households; b) households were not only dependent on fishing but on numerous other <b>aquatic</b> <b>resources</b> based livelihood activities; c) the most significant cost item for <b>aquatic</b> <b>resources</b> based livelihood activities was labor; d) while among the extractive activities fishing contributed relatively more to total economic value, other activities such as fish culture, fish processing and the gathering of aquatic plants, animals, and wood also contributed significantly to economic value; and e) other activities which specifically depended on water and not necessarily on resource extraction, such as irrigated rice farming, duck raising, and water transportation, also added significantly to total economic value. Some policy implications were put forward including broadly based management of <b>aquatic</b> <b>resources,</b> active cooperation and participation of other water-based government agencies in <b>aquatic</b> <b>resources</b> management, and promotion of investment and credit for households in selected <b>aquatic</b> <b>resources</b> based livelihood activities...|$|R

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) This thesis uses a {{political}} ecology framework to critically analyse how development and environmental orthodoxies influence the use, management {{and development of}} <b>living</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>resources</b> in an information poor developing country context. The research focuses specifically on Lao PDR, the only landlocked country of the Mekong River Basin, to question how knowledge over <b>living</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>resources</b> is framed by a range of stakeholders. Specific attention is given to how aquaculture has gained ascendancy over capture fisheries in the rhetoric of resources users as well as government and nongovernment organisations. The empirical research focuses {{on the role of}} broad scale economic, social and environmental influences over resource use, the practical and perceived importance of both aquaculture and capture fisheries in rural Lao livelihoods and finally, how <b>living</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>resources</b> are represented within the dominant development agendas of conservation, poverty alleviation and rural development. Field work was conducted in Savannakhet province in Southern Lao PDR over 18 months from 2001 to 2002. The thesis has a strong empirical research base divided into activities carried out over multiple scales ranging from household to the Mekong River Basin. The thesis begins by establishing the historical context of resource use as well as the major orthodoxies on which development is based. Attention then turns to the extensive empirical research conducted over three districts of Savannakhet province. The results of the empirical research report two macro scale studies at the district level. The first is a survey of fish ponds across three districts focusing on the spatial distribution of investment and resource use. The second is a survey of fish trade focusing on the differential trade between culture and capture fish species. The results of both studies highlight the disjuncture between complex patterns of aquaculture and capture fishery use and the major assumptions made about the use of these two resources by policy makers and management. Analysis then moves to the local level focusing on the role and importance of aquaculture and capture fisheries to the livelihoods of rural Lao communities. The results show the instrumental and hermeneutic importance of fish and other aquatic resources in the livelihoods of households and the community. In particular it is shown that capture fisheries are more important to rural livelihoods in terms of income and nutrition, while aquaculture is perceived as a more important activity in the development of community and household economies. ii The final section then compares the empirical findings of the thesis with the policy and planning agendas of government and non-government organisations. The analysis focuses on the role of ideas and agency creating a highly politicised policy environment concluding that aquaculture based policy is more compatible with both government and non government agendas of poverty alleviation and rural development than capture fisheries. Furthermore, capture fisheries are marginalised within conservation as a resource that cannot contribute to the improvement of livelihoods or alleviate poverty. The thesis concludes that <b>living</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>resources</b> provide an imperative source of food and income to rural communities through diverse and complex human-environment interactions. In contrast government and non-government organisations operating at regional, national and local scales of policy and planning simplify these relationships drawing on wider orthodoxies of aquaculture and capture fisheries development. These simplifications do not reflect the problems and needs of the predominantly rural population. Furthermore, {{in the absence of a}} strong empirical base of information, <b>living</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>resources</b> management and development has become highly politicised. Instead of responding to the realities of resource users, policy and planning reflect the interests and beliefs of development organisations, government and non-government. The thesis provides an important, grounded account of the importance of <b>living</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>resources</b> to rural livelihoods in Lao PDR and how these resources are understood and translated into national development and management agendas. In doing so the thesis contributes to an understanding of how complex human-environmental systems are perceived and represented in development policy and wider knowledge systems. The thesis also makes an important theoretical contribution to the growing body of literature on critical political ecology by arguing for the revitalisation of ecology as an integrated approach within political ecology and more widely within the study of humanenvironment interaction...|$|E

40|$|The {{sustainable}} use of <b>aquatic</b> <b>living</b> <b>resources</b> {{is the cornerstone}} of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAF). Excess fishing effort leading to the degradation of fishery resources and significant economic waste is globally recognized by resource managers as a major problem for the implementation of the EAF and European’s Union Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). Knowledge of how fishers allocate their fishing effort in space and time is essential to understand how a fishery develops. Understanding fishing strategies is also vital for predicting how a fishery might respond to proposed management changes such as effort/area restrictions and introduction of a marine protected area, and for drawing up a management policy. Random utility models were used to examine the factors affecting fishers’ behaviour in the NE Mediterranean. The probability of selecting a specific fishing rectangle was estimated using monthly purse seine data. The predictive inputs concerned both subjective behavioural and objective seasonal and technical-economic characteristics. The present study provided direct evidence of the important role that the strategic decision-making behaviour of fishers could play in understanding the way the industry will respond to changes in resource availability, market conditions and management measures under the EAF principle...|$|R
