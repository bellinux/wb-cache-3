50|$|In 1981, Hannah {{left the}} band and {{gradually}} became involved {{with a small group}} of underground activists calling themselves Direct Action. In the alternative media they were referred to as the Vancouver 5, but in the mainstream press they were dubbed the Squamish 5. The group, composed of ecologists and feminists, were responsible for a number of actions, including the 14 October 1982 bombing of the Litton Industries plant in Ontario which made guidance systems for cruise missiles. The Litton bombing hurt several plant workers and three police officers were also injured. While Gerry was not part of the Litton bombing, he supported it, and did take part in other actions, as well as planning to rob a Brinks truck to fund future actions. He was arrested on 20 January 1983, along with the four other members of Direct Action. Many benefits were arranged for the group by people such as Jello Biafra and Joey Shithead of D.O.A. to pay <b>lawyers</b> <b>fees</b> but, in the end, Hannah pleaded guilty to avoid years in prison. He received a 10-year sentence and was released after serving 5 years.

40|$|Background Thyroidectomy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{intervention}} in general surgery and, after the turn of the century, its rate has sharply increased, along with a worldwide increased incidence of differentiated thyroid cancers. Therefore, injuries of the recurrent laryngeal nerve have become one of the most frequent cause of surgical malpractice claims, mostly following surgery for benign pathology. Main body Even if the incidence of definitive paralysis is generally lower than 3 %, during the last 20 years in Italy, the number of claims for damages has sharply raised. As a consequence, a lot of defensive medicine has been caused by this issue, and a witch-hunt has been accordingly triggered, so determining mostly a painful and lasting frustration for the surgeons, who sometimes are compelled to pay a lot of money for increasing insurance premiums and <b>lawyers</b> <b>fees.</b> Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury should be considered as a potentially catastrophic predictable but not preventable event, rather than the result of a surgical mistake. Conclusion Purposes of the Authors are analyzing incidence, conditions of risk, and mechanisms of recurrent laryngeal nerve injuries, underlining notes of surgical technique and defining medical practice recommendations useful to reduce the risk of malpractice lawsuits and judgments against surgeons...|$|E
40|$|Class action {{lawyers are}} some of the most {{frequently}} derided players in our system of civil litigation. It is often asserted that class action lawyers take too much from class judgments as fees, that class actions are little more than a device for the lawyers to enrich themselves at the expense of the class. In this Article, I argue that some of this criticism of class action lawyers is misguided. In particular, I perform a normative examination of fee percentages in class action litigation using the social-welfarist utilitarian account of litigation known as deterrence-insurance theory. I argue that in perhaps the most common class action [...] the so-called "small stakes" class action [...] class action lawyers not only do not make too much, but actually make too little. Indeed, I argue that it is hard to see as a theoretical matter why lawyers should not receive 100 % of class judgments in small-stakes cases. Of course, it is unlikely that judges in the current political climate will feel comfortable awarding class action <b>lawyers</b> <b>fees</b> equal to 100 % of judgments in any type of class action, small stakes or otherwise. Moreover, it is not entirely clear that judges have the legal authority to award fees at such a level. Nonetheless, even if judges cannot award 100 % of small-stakes judgments to class action lawyers due to political or legal constraints, deterrence-insurance theory suggests that they should award fee percentages as high as they can in small-stakes cases, which, by any measure, are much higher than the percentages they tend to award now. Unfortunately, deterrence-insurance theory is unable to provide judges with as much guidance in large-stakes and mixed-stakes class actions...|$|E

40|$|Silicon Valley {{law firms}} {{were among the}} first to {{experiment}} in taking stock in their technology start-up clients. Law firms in other financial centers in the United States have also begun to accept equity in their high-tech clients, as have several Canadian law firms. Even the most conservative law firms in England have accepted accepting small equity stakes in their clients, and the trend is spreading throughout Europe. This article critically analyzes the practice of lawyers taking equity in their clients as compensation for rendering legal services. The article concludes that equity billing can provide significant private benefits to law firms and clients, as well as indirect public benefits. The article also concludes that equity billing can be usefully analogized to contingency fee arrangements: equity billing is to start-up clients and corporate legal work what contingency fee arrangements are to impecunious litigants and access to the courts. The article then addresses ethical issues raised by equity billing. Can equity billing be reconciled with ethical rules that <b>lawyers?</b> <b>fees</b> be reasonable? Can equity billing be reconciled with concerns about conflicts between a client?s best interests and the lawyer?s self-interest? Equity billing also raises a concern that the lawyer?s role as guardian of the public interest, particularly in the context of public securities markets, will be undermined. This article applies the economic theory of gatekeeping and concludes that equity billing may impose externalities on third parties such as retail investors who rely on issuers? lawyers to ensure compliance with securities laws. The article concludes that a case cannot be made for prohibiting equity billing or capping the amount of equity that a lawyer can take in a client, and that the most appropriate form of regulation is heightened disclosure of equity billing arrangements, coupled with letting existing ethical rules, fiduciary principles and market forces regulate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The tax {{authority}} {{has an obligation}} to ensure that all tax cases are adequately investigated according to 40 : 1 SFL. In order to fulfill this obligation the {{tax authority}} has a number of investigation options. The most common form of investigation is so- called desktop investigations, which means that the tax authority will send written inquiries or injunctions to taxpayers. The most intrusive and resource-intensive form of investigation is audit. The general rule is that the tax authority’s auditor may examine all accounting records and other documents related to the business. Since an audit decision cannot be appealed, the revised may request that certain documents should be excluded from the audit, 47 : 3 SFL. There are three possibilities for excluding documents according to 47 : 2 SFL. The first reason applies to documents that may not be seized and the second reason applies to documents that are not covered by the audit. The third and last possibility for exclusion applies to documents with a significant protective value. The last mentioned possibility may only be exempted if the protective value outweighs the importance of the tax authority’s control. If the tax authority doesn’t agree that the document should be excluded the county’s administrative court must decide the case {{on the basis of the}} documents contents and the revised evidence. This essays first purpose is to examine which documents can be excluded from a tax authority’s audit and therefore to investigate the legal situation. To fulfill the first purpose, a legal dogmatic method has been used. Analyzing court cases has concluded the following. Documents may not be seized if there is a confidential relationship between a lawyer and a client. It is therefore not the content of document, but the fact that the document has been entrusted to a lawyer that is the reason for exclusion. The confidential relationship has also been considered to include a third party in some specific situations. However, certain information in documents has not been considered as information entrusted by a lawyer in his profession. This information relates to clients identity, <b>lawyers</b> <b>fees</b> and other expenses. The question regarding documents that should be excluded because they are not covered by the audit is not completely clear. This is due to the absence of precedence. The documents that can be excluded on this basis are if the documents do not refer to the taxation or if they are not of importance in the business. Documents may also be excluded because of its significant protective value if they contain sensitive personal information, qualified tax advice or industrial secrets. It also requires that the tax authority’s need to control is relatively low. This essay also aims to examine how the legal rules of exclusion of documents relate to the rule of law. The aspects of the rule of law that has been considered are: integrity, predictability, the principle of legality and the principle of equal treatment. To fulfill the second purpose, a legal political method has been used. The following has been determined by an analysis of the legal rules of exclusion in relation to the rule of law. Audit is a form of control that ensures a high efficiency. The rules of exclusion of documents increase legal certainty in an acceptable way for the revised. That is because the rules strengthens the integrity, are acceptably predictable, are legislated and fulfill the principle of equal treatment. Therefore the rules of exclusion do not require any change in relations to the rule of law. ...|$|E
