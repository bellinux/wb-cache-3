5|$|The actual {{pay-per-view}} {{opened with}} the <b>Legion</b> <b>of</b> Doom (Hawk and Animal) taking on Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster). The <b>Legion</b> <b>of</b> Doom used {{their size and}} power to wear down their opponents in the opening minutes of the match. Money Inc. gained the advantage when Hawk missed a flying clothesline. Hawk tried to tag in his partner but was unable for several minutes because Money Inc. kept {{him away from the}} corner where Animal was standing. Eventually, Hawk and Schyster hit each other at the same time. Hawk tagged Animal in, and the <b>Legion</b> <b>of</b> Doom attempted the Doomsday device, their signature move. Schyster stopped them, but Animal hit Schyster in retaliation, causing Schyster to run into DiBiase. Animal then powerslammed DiBiase and pinned him to get the victory.|$|E
5|$|The undercard {{included}} two tag team matches: Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R.

The <b>Legion</b> <b>of</b> Doom held the championship belts until dropping the title to Money Inc. This title change occurred after Hawk failed {{a drug test}} and was suspended. Once Hawk's suspension ended, a rematch was scheduled to take place at SummerSlam. The match was first scheduled as a title match but Money Inc. lost the championship to The Natural Disasters.|$|E
