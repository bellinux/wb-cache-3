500|$|Both of Wollstonecraft's novels criticize {{what she}} {{viewed as the}} [...] {{institution}} of marriage and its deleterious effects on women. In her first novel, Mary: A Fiction (1788), the eponymous heroine is forced into a loveless marriage for economic reasons; she fulfils her desire for love and affection outside of marriage with two passionate romantic friendships, one with a woman and one with a man. Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman (1798), an unfinished novel published posthumously and often considered Wollstonecraft's most radical feminist work, revolves around {{the story of a}} woman imprisoned in an insane asylum by her husband; <b>like</b> <b>Mary,</b> Maria also finds fulfilment outside of marriage, in an affair with a fellow inmate and a friendship with one of her keepers. Neither of Wollstonecraft's novels depict successful marriages, although she posits such relationships in the Rights of Woman. At the end of Mary, the heroine believes she is going [...] "to that world where there is neither marrying, nor giving in marriage", presumably a positive state of affairs.|$|E
500|$|In 1536, Queen Anne {{fell from}} the king's favour and was beheaded. Elizabeth, <b>like</b> <b>Mary,</b> was {{declared}} illegitimate and stripped of her succession rights. Within two weeks of Anne's execution, Henry married Jane Seymour, who urged her husband {{to make peace with}} Mary. Henry insisted that Mary recognise him as head of the Church of England, repudiate papal authority, acknowledge that the marriage between her parents was unlawful, and accept her own illegitimacy. She attempted to reconcile with him by submitting to his authority as far as [...] "God and my conscience" [...] permitted, but she was eventually bullied into signing a document agreeing to all of Henry's demands. Reconciled with her father, Mary resumed her place at court. Henry granted her a household (which included the reinstatement of Mary's favourite Susan Clarencieux). Mary's privy purse expenses for this period show that Hatfield House, the Palace of Beaulieu (also called Newhall), Richmond and Hunsdon were among her principal places of residence, as well as Henry's palaces at Greenwich, Westminster and Hampton Court. Her expenses included fine clothes and gambling at cards, one of her favourite pastimes. Rebels in the North of England, including Lord Hussey, Mary's former chamberlain, campaigned against Henry's religious reforms, and one of their demands was that Mary be made legitimate. The rebellion, known as the Pilgrimage of Grace, was ruthlessly suppressed. Along with other rebels, Hussey was executed, but there was no suggestion that Mary was directly involved. The following year, 1537, Jane died after giving birth to a son, Edward. Mary was made godmother to her half-brother and acted as chief mourner at the queen's funeral.|$|E

40|$|Automatic speech {{recognition}} has improved {{dramatically over the}} past few decades. The goal of such systems is typically only to output a simple stream of words. Humans, however, use information beyond words alone to convey and comprehend messages. Such information includes intonation (variations in pitch), rhythm and timing of speech sounds, stress and loudness patterns, and even variation in voice quality. Together, these cues are referred to as prosodic information. For example, prosodic information is crucial to determining meaning in the following examples: (a) John <b>likes</b> <b>Mary.</b> John <b>likes</b> <b>Mary?</b> (b) JOHN <b>likes</b> <b>Mary.</b> John <b>likes</b> <b>MARY.</b> (c) No. Dogs are allowed. No dogs are allowed. Prosody is also used by speakers to convey and detect emotional states, level of interest, and so on. The use of prosody for all of these functions is integral to speech across languages, and not limited to the otherwise ambiguous examples shown above. One way to see this clearly is in synthesized speech, which despite great strides in intelligibility, still often sounds unnatural. In this work, we focus on the function in example (c), that is, we examine how to harness prosody to help automatically identify sentence boundaries in speech. Speech recognition output generally does not contain any punctuation marks. Although a speaker using a dictation system may train him- or herself to explicitly utter “comma”, “semi-colon”, “period”, this is a particularly unnatural way of speaking. People talking with each other do not do this at all. Instead, they convey punctuation implicitly, via prosodic and syntactic information. To identify sentence boundaries in speech, we use both words and prosodic information. Words and syntactic information are no doubt very important t...|$|R

2500|$|Women {{artists were}} {{generally}} banned from art studios or academies during sessions with live models, {{so many women}} painted bourgeois life by default. [...] Yet, Charmy's work exhibits an interest in painting female models and prostitutes, including expression of women's sexuality. [...] Such images of women are common among male artists, like Degas, but were rare among women artists. Most women artists were interested in painting an idyllic view of women and their children. Despite Charmy's interest in using female models as subjects for her paintings, she avoided the mother-and-child theme that was becoming increasingly popular, especially with contemporary artists <b>like</b> <b>Mary</b> Cassatt.|$|E

2500|$|British {{history was}} a very common subject, with the Middle Ages, Elizabeth I, Mary, Queen of Scots and the English Civil War {{especially}} popular sources for subjects. [...] Many painters mentioned elsewhere painted historical subjects, including Millais (The Boyhood of Raleigh and many others), Ford Madox Brown (Cromwell on his Farm), David Wilkie, Watts and Frith, and West, Bonington and Turner in earlier decades. [...] The London-based Irishman Daniel Maclise and Charles West Cope painted scenes for the new Palace of Westminster. [...] Lady Jane Grey was, <b>like</b> <b>Mary</b> Queen of Scots, a female whose sufferings attracted many painters, though none quite matched The Execution of Lady Jane Grey, one of many British historical subjects by the Frenchman Paul Delaroche. [...] Painters prided themselves on the increasing accuracy of their period settings in terms of costume and objects, studying the collections of the new Victoria and Albert Museum and books, and scorning the breezy approximations of earlier generations of artists.|$|E

[...] In talks with Brims it was decided a young niece from Brims' family would be betrothed to Musgrove’s son, so as to maintain the native rules of kinship and reciprocity and thus help reinforce the peace treaty.

2500|$|Gable was {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Tarzan in Tarzan the Ape Man, but lost out to Johnny Weissmuller's more imposing physique and superior swimming prowess. However, Gable's unshaven lovemaking with braless Jean Harlow in Red Dust (1932) soon made him MGM's most important male star. After the hit Hold Your Man (1933), MGM recognized the goldmine of the Gable-Harlow pairing, putting them in two more films, China Seas (1935; with Gable and Harlow billed above Wallace Beery) and Wife vs. Secretary (1936) with Myrna Loy and James Stewart. An enormously popular combination, on-screen and off-screen, Gable and Harlow made six films together, the most notable being Red Dust (1932) and Saratoga (1937). Harlow died during production of Saratoga. Ninety percent completed, the remaining scenes were filmed with long shots or the use of doubles <b>like</b> <b>Mary</b> Dees; Gable said that {{he felt as if he}} were [...] "in the arms of a ghost".|$|E
2500|$|MacDonagh {{points out}} {{that none of the}} marriages in Austen's fiction of which she {{approved}} was financially imprudent. For Austen, marriage and children were a girl's natural and best aspiration. She advocated sincere attachment, material prudence and circumspect delay in the choice of a marriage partner. If the appropriate conditions were met, then marriage should follow. Austen realized that women without independent means felt very great pressure to marry someone who could look after them, because otherwise they would be a burden on their families. The marriage market that she describes is quite detailed and well understood by all concerned. For example, as is explained in Mansfield Park, [...] "Miss Maria Ward, 'with only seven thousand pounds', had the good luck to captivate a baronet, 'her uncle, the lawyer, allowed her to be at least three thousand pounds short of any equitable claim to it'. To indulge in a marriage less lucrative than might have been expected was regarded as 'throwing oneself away', and someone <b>like</b> <b>Mary</b> Crawford, who prided herself on her realism, could not bring herself to do it." ...|$|E
