5|$|As {{microwave}} systems entered service, {{along with}} updated versions of aircraft carrying them, the problem arose {{of what to}} do with those aircraft carrying Mk. IV that were otherwise serviceable. One possibility, suggested as early as 1942, was homing in on the Luftwaffe's own radar sets. The basic operational frequencies of the Luftwaffes counterpart to the Mk. IV, the FuG 202 Lichtenstein BC radar, had been discovered in December 1942. On 3 April 1943 the Air Interception Committee ordered the TRE to begin considering the homing concept under the codename Serrate. As <b>luck</b> <b>would</b> have it, this proved to be perfect timing. In the late afternoon of 9 May 1943, a crew from IV/NJG.3 defected to the UK by flying their fully equipped Ju 88R-1 night fighter, D5+EV, to RAF Dyce in Scotland, giving the TRE their first direct look at the Lichtenstein.|$|E
5|$|Adapted from The Old Curiosity Shop by Charles Dickens, {{the film}} has been {{shortened}} and streamlined for the single reel format. The film focuses on a grandfather who gambles himself into poverty. He dotes on his granddaughter, Little Nell, and desires to give her every luxury. The grandfather turns to gambling to try and earn money, firmly believing that <b>luck</b> <b>would</b> favor him. His gambling results in losing everything and Nell fears {{that he will be}} taken away to an asylum. At night, Nell flees with him and they find refuge and shelter with Mrs. Jarley. The grandfather, seeking to win money, robs Nell of her money and proceeds to gamble it away. The grandfather is coerced by men to steal to pay the debts, but Nell intervenes and flees with her grandfather again. Exhausted and feeble in health, Nell meets a kind schoolmaster and appeals to him for aid before falling unconscious at his feet. The schoolmaster takes the two in, but it is too late to save Nell and she dies. Her grandfather is brokenhearted and is found dead on her grave several days later.|$|E

5|$|Ramsay's request {{arrived at}} RAF Kenley. Two {{experienced}} pilots, Group Captain Francis Victor Beamish (10 victories) and Wing Commander Finlay Boyd (14 victories), were sent on patrol to investigate. Flying over the channel in Spitfires, {{they ran into}} large numbers of Bf 109s protecting a large fleet of warships and dived away. Holding radio silence they kept their discovery until they landed. They sighted the ships at 10:42 and landed at 11:09. It was another 16 minutes before Bomber Command was alerted and Ramsay {{did not know of}} the situation until 11:30. Soon afterwards, at around 12:16 GMT, the first naval actions began between escorting Schnellboots and British Motor Torpedo Boats (MTBs) and the British were alerted. Galland ordered all low flying to cease and allowed Max Ibel and his team aboard Scharnhorst to break radio silence. Ibel then began directing Fw 190 and Bf 109s toward RAF units heading to the area. As <b>luck</b> <b>would</b> have it, as the first outnumbered British units entered the airspace over the ships, the German vessels were now at their closest point to German airfields. It allowed the Luftwaffe to offer maximum protection.|$|E
5|$|As {{the green}} flag flew on lap 38, Chip Ganassi Racing held a one–two with Franchitti leading Dixon, {{with two of}} the Dreyer & Reinbold cars—Conway and Wilson—holding third and fourth places, with the only {{remaining}} KV car of E. J. Viso holding fifth, the Venezuelan disposing of Castroneves just after the restart. Realising that the gamble had backfired, the lead quintet pitted on laps 41 and 42, which cycled Hunter-Reay back through to the lead. Power made an error which allowed Matos and Briscoe to move ahead of him. Briscoe moved ahead of Matos on lap 45 and set off in chase of Hunter-Reay. Four laps later, the Australian was on the American's tail, and moved ahead after an outbraking move into the final hairpin. Hunter-Reay immediately regained the position into the first chicane on Lap 51, before Briscoe sealed the place with a similar final hairpin move {{at the end of the}} lap. Briscoe's <b>luck</b> <b>would</b> run out, however, when he overcooked it into turn five on lap 54, and nudged the barriers with his nose assembly, bringing out the fourth and final caution of the race. The time limit meant that only six laps remained at the restart, with Hunter-Reay leading Power, Matos, Meira and Wheldon. Meira soon passed his fellow Brazilian for third on Lap 57, and began to chase down the lead duo, who had changed positions after Power used the slipstream to overtake Hunter-Reay into the final corner. Power moved away from Hunter-Reay in the final laps, taking the chequered flag to cap his return from injury with a victory. Hunter-Reay took his best result for a year in second, with another injury returnee, Meira, finishing third. Matos was fourth, holding off seven other cars, as fourth to eleventh were covered by 3.49 seconds at the race's conclusion. Wheldon led those seven in fifth, ahead of the Ganassis, Conway, Castroneves, Kanaan and Wilson. Viso finished twelfth ahead of top rookie Beatriz, a recovering Briscoe, Danica Patrick and de Silvestro, the final two off the lead lap.|$|E
25|$|Following {{surgery on}} his {{shoulder}} during the off-season, Luck was held out of training camp and the preseason, and it was announced he was to miss regular season games. Following the Colts' Week 4 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, Colts' general manager Chris Ballard stated that <b>Luck</b> <b>would</b> begin practicing, but {{was not ready to}} fully return to games. On November 2, the Colts placed Luck on injured reserve, meaning that he was ruled out for the 2017 season.|$|E

25|$|In a Week 4 {{win against}} the Tennessee Titans, Luck {{became the first}} quarterback in NFL history to throw for 370 yards or more, 4 touchdowns, and have a {{completion}} percentage 70 percent or above in consecutive games.

Indianapolis jumped out to a 24–0 lead after 1 quarter, and would hold on to beat the Texans 33–28.

Minnesota held the Seahawks scoreless until the fourth quarter, but could not reach the end zone themselves and had to settle for field goals the whole game. The Seahawks managed to score a touchdown and a field goal deep in the fourth quarter to take a 10-9 lead, but the Vikings seemed poised to score a fourth field goal and win until Vikings kicker Blair Walsh missed a 27-yard chip shot, allowing the Seahawks to escape with the victory. However, the Seahawks' <b>luck</b> <b>would</b> run out in the Divisional round, against the #1 seed Carolina Panthers.

25|$|On April 9, the Colts {{announced}} they {{had picked up}} the fifth-year option on Luck's contract, which will pay him a guaranteed $16.55 million in 2016. In Weeks 4 and 5, Luck missed the first two games of his career with an injured shoulder. Backup Matt Hasselbeck played in his place and led the team to a 16–13 overtime win over the Jacksonville Jaguars, followed by a 27–20 Thursday Night Football victory over the Houston Texans. Luck returned to the lineup on October 18 in a 34–27 loss to the New England Patriots. On November 2, Luck led the Colts back from a 17-point deficit in the fourth quarter to force overtime against the Carolina Panthers, but his third interception of the game helped lead to the Panthers' three-point win. On November 10, it was announced that <b>Luck</b> <b>would</b> miss 2–6 weeks with a lacerated kidney and a partially torn abdominal muscle, suffered during the fourth quarter of the Colts 27–24 win over the previously undefeated Denver Broncos two days prior.

Macartney and Trumper played together for Gordon Cricket Club {{on the north shore}} and became close friends. Macartney regularly practised on the Trumper family's backyard turf pitch. Trumper's relocation made more frequent meetings possible, since the Sydney Harbour Bridge was not to open until 1932, and the only way of travelling between either side of the bay was by ferry. Trumper was regarded as the [...] "crown prince of the golden age of cricket", the finest and most stylish batsman of his era, {{and one of the most}} elegant strokemakers of all time. Under Trumper's influence, Macartney became more audacious and adventurous; Unlike their English counterparts, the Australians were proud of their spontaneous play. Macartney revered Trumper as both a cricketer and a person, and was to be a pall bearer when Trumper died in 1915 at the age of 37. However, unlike Trumper, Macartney was known for his habit of [...] "walking", the act of leaving the ground before or contrary to an umpire's decision if a batsman knows that he is out. On one occasion, Macartney felt so guilty that the umpire had incorrectly ruled him not out despite a clear edge that he attempted to throw his wicket away with a wild airborne shot.
