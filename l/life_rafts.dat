5|$|The floods {{also hit}} the Church of England primary school, with the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service {{evacuating}} pupils and staff {{from the school}} in <b>life</b> <b>rafts.</b> The evacuation used four rafts, rescuing pupils and teachers from the school through windows. The 165 people (140 pupils and 25 members of staff) were taken uphill to the parish hall, where blankets and sleeping bags had been provided.|$|E
5|$|Commander David W. Bagley, the destroyer's commander, {{ordered all}} <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> and boats launched. As the ship sank, her bow {{raised in the}} air almost {{vertically}} before she began to slip beneath the waves. At this point the armed depth charges began to explode, killing a number of {{men who had been}} unable to escape the destroyer, and stunning many others in the water. The destroyer, the first United States destroyer ever lost to enemy action, sank eight minutes after the torpedo struck the rudder, taking with her two officers and 64 men.|$|E
5000|$|Abandon Ship: Teams have to race a <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> from a ship to the shore. First, {{at least}} one player has to pull off three buoys from a line resting 25, 20 and 15 {{feet below the surface}} of the <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> buoy, which is five feet below the water. After the last buoy is pulled, the <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> {{immediately}} inflates above the water, and each team races in their <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> to the shore. A team is given a five-minute penalty is a player does not pull off a buoy before a teammate jumps off the ship into the water. The team that advances their <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> to the shore in the fastest time wins Power Team, while the team with the slowest time is automatically sent to the Arena.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the experimental and numerical investigations {{of a novel}} design of a pneumatic <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> in calm water conditions. Two main issues were considered: the <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> performance under tow and its resistance in calm water conditions. The experiment and CFD simulations were performed by using the full scale prototype to eliminate the scale effect. The towing tank tests confirmed the results of numerical computations. The compatibility {{of the results of}} numerical and experimental tests was high mainly because the new <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> does not deform under the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loads. The characteristics similar to rigid body behaviour result mainly from a new construction and materials used for manufacturing the <b>life</b> <b>raft...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Bradley had one <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> {{stored in}} the bow section and two {{lifeboats}} {{stored in the}} stern section. The crew in the stern section attempted to lower the lifeboats. [...] One lifeboat became entangled in cables and the other lifeboat dangled at an impossible angle for launching or boarding. [...] The <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> was tossed clear of the wreck when the bow section sank. [...] The four crew members who reached the <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> were repeatedly thrown off by the massive waves and only two survived.|$|R
5|$|On 4 March 1943, {{during the}} Battle of the Bismarck Sea, General George Kenney ordered Allied patrol boats and {{aircraft}} to attack Japanese rescue vessels, {{as well as}} the survivors from the sunken vessels on <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> and swimming or floating in the sea. This was later justified on the grounds that rescued servicemen would have been rapidly landed at their military destination and promptly returned to active service. These orders violated the Hague Convention of 1907, which banned the killing of shipwreck survivors under any circumstances.|$|E
5|$|The group {{discovered}} U-853 bottomed in , {{and dropped}} depth charges and hedgehogs during a 16-hour attack. At first the U-boat attempted to flee, {{and then tried}} to hide by lying still. Both times it was found by sonar. The morning of 6 May 1945 two K-Class blimps from Lakehurst, New Jersey, K-16 and K-58, joined the attack, locating oil slicks and marking suspected locations with smoke and dye markers. K-16 also attacked with 7.2-inch rocket bombs. Numerous depth charge and hedgehog attacks from Atherton and Moberly resulted in planking, <b>life</b> <b>rafts,</b> a chart tabletop, clothing, and an officer's cap floating to the surface. With the loss of all 55 officers and men, U-853 {{was one of the last}} U-boats sunk during World War II. and, with , the last to be sunk in US waters. Atherton and Moberly received credit for the kill.|$|E
5|$|As rations {{and water}} dwindled, {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were made}} on 10 June to rescue {{the men in the}} stranded barge with support from artillery and aircraft. While Corsairs flew close support missions, Beaufort and Mitchell bombers dropped <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> but the survivors were unable to reach them due to machine-gun fire. Further casualties occurred when, in the early morning of 11 June, a Japanese soldier managed to reach the vessel and fired upon the occupants with a machine-gun, killing two and wounding others before he was killed himself. Shortly after this a Japanese anti-tank gun fired two shells at the landing craft, destroying its stern. Further shots were prevented when Australian artillery ranged in on the gun, having been directed by Captain John Whitelaw, an artillery observer on one of two landing craft that had been despatched with canvas assault boats, crewed by engineers from the 16th Field Company.|$|E

5000|$|The {{airborne}} life boats {{used by the}} USAF at {{the start}} of the 1950s had two major flaws; they required specially modified aircraft to drop them, and in heavy weather and high winds when dropped they could drift away from the exhausted survivors or be swamped and over turned. The USAF, [...] "Air Sea Rescue Unit of the Air Material Command", was tasked with studying the problem and coming up with a solution. Their solution was an air dropped life boat which before it inflated in the water, looked like a torpedo and could be carried by almost any aircraft in service that had heavy wing pylons. [...] When the boat was dropped near the survivors, on impacting the water large inflatable tubes which were connected to the rescue torpedo inflated, resulting in a radio controlled self-propelled <b>life</b> <b>raft.</b> The pilot would then start the <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> engine by radio control and steer the <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> to the survivors. When the survivors had boarded the <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> one of the rescue aircraft circling above would continue to control and steer the <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> to a safe zone for pick up, or allow the survivors to take over control. The <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> contained its own autopilot, water, dehydrated food, a two way rescue radio and enough fuel for 300 miles of travel.|$|R

5|$|Seventy-four of the 273 {{personnel}} from Evans {{were killed in}} the collision, with the majority of these believed to have been asleep or trapped inside the bow section, which sank within minutes. Melbourne deployed her boats, <b>life</b> <b>rafts,</b> and lifebuoys, before carefully manoeuvring alongside the stern section of Evans, where both ships' crews used mooring lines to lash the ships together. Sailors from Melbourne dived from the flight deck into the water to rescue overboard survivors close to the carrier, while the carrier's boats and helicopters collected those farther out. All of the survivors were located within 12 minutes of the collision and rescued before half an hour had passed, although the search continued for fifteen more hours. After Evans stern was evacuated, it was cast off, while the carrier moved away to avoid damage. The stern did not sink, and was later recovered, stripped of parts, and sunk for target practice.|$|E
