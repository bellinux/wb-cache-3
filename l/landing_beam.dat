This structure {{is expected to}} operate at extreme temperature (- 54 OC and 71 °C). The stress analysis of composite wing with these thermal loads along with structural loads assumes more importance {{in view of the}} directional dependence of co-efficient of thermal expansion between various members. The joints between metallic <b>landing</b> <b>beams</b> and surrounding composite structure are investigated. These joints are subjected to shear transfer at the fastener locations due to difference in co-efficient of thermal expansion between composite and metallic materials. FE analysis of wing is carried out with combination of thermal and critical flight and landing load cases. FE analysis shows that the structure is safe from strength point of view. Failure-indies are less than 1. 0. Also, the fasteners forces and corresponding bearing stresses are calculated at the <b>landing</b> gear <b>beam</b> joint to composite structure.

50|$|Hermine: This {{system was}} a VHF radio beacon. Originally {{developed}} in 1942 due to problems the design was suspended. When in 1944 the existing radio navigation systems were either being jammed or under physical attach the design was revisited. It {{consisted of a}} rotating radio beacon transmitting at 30 -33 MHz. The signal consisted of a tone and a robot voice using FM. The robot voice was encoded onto an optical disk. The voice spoke a number between 1 and 35, corresponding to 10 degrees of angle from the beacon. The pilot listened to the signal, when the tone disappeared the next number corresponded to the angle from the beacon. It was expected that this would give an angular resolution of about 5 degrees but when tested {{it was found that}} some pilots could estimate to within 3 degrees. The receiver was a modified EBL 3 which had had its bandwidth increased and fitted with a FM interface board. This board also connected to the pilots audio via the Fug16 to send the audio information to the pilot. In single-seater aircraft the radio fit was numbered FuG 125. The beacon identifier was transmitted instead of the number 0. This allowed a pilot to select a particular beacon. Between 10 -20 beacons were commissioned by May 1945. 30 channels were available with 2 more being reserved for airfield ILS. Beacons were usually placed 20 km from a runway, The pilot would over fly the beacon and then circle until he acquired the ILS <b>landing</b> <b>beam</b> on the FuBL 2 equipment. Ground units were BS 15 navigation radio beacons constructed from rebuilt FuG 15 sets.|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of {{staircase}} damages in reinforced concrete frame structures has attracted much concern during 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake. In order to fully investigate the interaction mechanism and failure modes between the staircase components and surrounding frame members, a static monotonic test on a one story two bay RC frame structure with staircase under the lateral loading was carried out. The experimental {{results indicated that the}} distribution of internal force in staircase components under the lateral loads is significantly different from the traditional design methodology in which only gravity loads are involved. The staircase can noticeably increase the lateral stiffness of overall structure but introduce the torsion effect as well. In general, the staircase experienced the damage earlier and much severe than the main structure. It was concluded that the flights are under the combined action termed the axial force, biaxial bending moment and biaxial shear force. The joint of flight and <b>landing</b> <b>beam</b> may {{become one of the most}} attacked parts by lateral force.

40|$|The highest {{frequency}} of gymnastic injuries occurs during the landing phase from a gymnastic dismount It {{has been shown}} through epidemiological studies that the knee is at great risk for injury during landings. The more extended the angle at the knee joint during landing, the greater the impact force at the knee joint. Due to landing restrictions imposed by judging criteria, gymnasts are pressured to <b>land</b> <b>beam</b> dismounts with minimal knee flexion. In this position, the tibiofemoral joint compressive forces reach maximum magnitude. The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyze preferred knee flexion angles during the landing phase from a beam round-off layout dismount.

Two requirements become a necessity: multiplexing and high spatial resolution capabilities. Thanks to its multiplexing capabilities, Multi-Object Spectroscopy (MOS) is becoming the central method to study large numbers of objects by recording simultaneously hundreds of spectra and utilizing a target selection mechanism in the field of view. Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) where identified by the major global astronomical and space societies as high-potential candidates for the use as reconfigurable target selection masks in future MOS: they are lightweight, remote-configurable, versatile and have the potential to be operated in cryogenic environment. Within the scope of this thesis the corner stones for a new class of MEMS mirror arrays (MMA) for the use in future MOS has been laid. The main requirements are: large tilt-angles of ≥ 20 ◦, feed-forward tilt-angle uniformity, large micromirrors of 100 × 200 μm 2 with a surface quality better than λ/ 20 and operation in cryogenic environment. The device concept, conceived to tackle these challenges, include a twochip architecture required to accommodate the large tilt-angle and mirror size. The micromirrors are made from 10 μm-thick bulk single crystalline silicon to provide maximum flatness. The micromirrors are suspended with polysilicon cantilever beams located on the mirror backside. A system of landing and stopper beams has been implemented, which, together with intermediate supporting beams for uniform spacing between mirror and electrode, aimed to provide feed-forward tilt-angle uniformity over large arrays. The individual chips were fabricated utilizing a combination of bulk- and surface micromachining. An assembly scheme for mirror and electrode chip, allowing passive alignment with an accuracy of ± 5 μm, has been developed and demonstrated. The mirrors of fabricated 5 × 5 arrays showed to have an excellent surface quality, with a peak-to-valley deformation of 35 nm for gold-coated mirrors at room temperature and 50 nm for gold-coated mirrors at cryogenic temperatures (100 K). Electromechanical characterization showed micromirrors yielding a tilt-angle of 20 ◦ at an actuation voltage below 90 V. The tiltangle in ON-state was stable within 3 arcmin over a voltage range of more than 10 V, demonstrating the stopper and <b>landing</b> <b>beam</b> concept. Successful operation of the micromirror array in vacuo and cryogenic environment at temperatures below 100 K has been showed and a preliminary demonstration of the object selection capabilities of the fabricated micromirrors has been carried out...|$|E

40|$|The {{disaster}} in Taiwan such as mountain collapse, landslide and mudflow {{is due to}} the human excessive, improper exploitation and overuse on hillside. The other natural cause is located at the severely movable plate surrounding the west Pacific Ocean earthquake zone. The active mountain motion makes three fourths of Taiwan area as mountain region. Therefore, the slope failure on the road occurs frequently caused by typhoon, rainstorm and flood with fragile geology. When the road is ruined from natural disaster, the fill and retaining wall are usually used for rehabilitation and restoring the road width. However, the poor compaction and overload will accompany with the fill construction. Furthermore, the footing of retaining wall can not penetrate into the stiff layer due to the limitation of road width. Then the road condition is not easily kept in good condition and even brings about the second disaster. A proper measure should be taken for solving the problem above. The landing bridge for road rehabilitation with limited width seems a feasible way. It uses a <b>landing</b> <b>beam</b> across the road to increase the width and take the above load. The overload condition with the fill will not happen in this measure. In the research the finite element program Plaxis is used to analyze the mechanical behavior of different cases of landing bridge with overhanging style. From the analyzed results, it indicates that using the overhanging I beam which is put on the concrete footing at the road base and at the mountain side, properly protecting the upper and lower slope of the road can feasibly solve the problem of limited width and provide the safety of road use. 台灣地區災害成因除人為山坡地過度與不當的開發及超限利用造成發生山崩、地滑與土石流外，天然條件因位處板塊活動劇烈之環西太平洋地震帶上，活躍的造山運動，造成台灣有將近四分之三的土地為山地區域，因此，除山高水深且地質脆弱外，於颱風、豪雨、洪水、地震的侵襲下，道路邊坡崩塌之狀況頻繁。 當道路遭遇天災損壞，為恢復道路原有路幅寬度則通常需以填方及擋土牆進行修復，但以土石料回填通常伴隨夯實不易及負載過重問題，另外受路幅限制下擋土牆基礎無法深入堅硬地盤中，因此容易造成維護困難及二次災害產生，故此仍須尋求其他可行之解決方案。棧梁式路面修復工法為一種可行性以解決上述問題，以棧梁支撐路面重量，達成增加路幅寬度目的，亦可解決高填方造成山坡負載過重問題。 本研究以Plaxis 2 D程式於路幅受限採懸臂棧橋作為穩定坡面之使用方式，進行不同案例之載重力學行為分析與探討，分析結果顯示:利用外懸工字梁，下方配合RC混凝土塊基礎座及靠山側混凝土擋土牆之施作，以及上下邊坡坡面適當之保護，可有效解決路幅不足問題，並提供道路使用之安全。目錄 摘要	i 目錄	iii 表目錄	vi 圖目錄	vii 第一章 緒論	 1 1. 1 前言	 1 1. 2 研究動機與目的	 1 1. 3 研究方法	 2 1. 4 研究內容	 2 第二章 文獻回顧	 4 2. 1 邊坡破壞類型	 4 2. 1. 1 淺層土壤破壞	 4 2. 1. 2 土石流	 6 2. 1. 3 表層土壤沖蝕	 8 2. 1. 4 近圓弧滑動破壞	 10 2. 1. 5 地層潛變位移	 12 2. 1. 6 順向坡滑動破壞	 14 2. 1. 7 落石	 16 2. 2 道路邊坡崩塌型態	 18 2. 2. 1 墜落型（Fall）	 18 2. 2. 2 傾覆型（Topple）	 19 2. 2. 3 滑動型（Slide）	 19 2. 2. 4 側移型（Spreads）	 19 2. 2. 5 流動型（Flow）	 20 2. 2. 6 潛移型（Creep）	 20 2. 3 邊坡潛在危險因素	 20 2. 4 一般擋土牆工程設計規範及流程	 21 2. 5 棧橋式修復工法介紹	 27 2. 5. 1 適用地形	 28 2. 5. 2 災害原因分析	 28 2. 5. 3 棧橋配置	 29 2. 5. 4 結構分析	 31 第三章 分析研究方法	 32 3. 1 Plaxis 2 D數值分析程式	 32 3. 1. 1 Input (輸入) 單元	 33 3. 1. 2 Calculation (計算) 單元	 34 3. 1. 3 Output (輸出) 單元	 34 3. 2 莫爾庫倫（Mohr-Coulomb）模式	 35 3. 3 莫爾庫倫模式之基本參數	 36 第四章 案例分析與討論	 37 4. 1 研究案例	 37 4. 2 研究案例之分類	 39 4. 3 分析步驟	 40 4. 4 案例分析結果與討論	 42 4. 4. 1 案例一 	 42 4. 4. 2 案例二	 45 4. 4. 3 案例三	 48 4. 4. 4 案例四	 51 4. 4. 5 案例五	 54 4. 4. 6 案例六	 57 4. 4. 7 案例七	 60 4. 4. 8 案例八	 63 4. 4. 9 研究案例分析數值統計	 67 第五章 結論與建議	 68 5. 1 結論	 68 5. 2 建議	 69 參考文獻	 70 表目錄 表 2 - 1 邊坡破壞類型與潛在危險因素關係	 21 表 4 - 1 材料分析使用參數	 37 表 4 - 2 研究案例分類表	 39 表 4 - 3 研究案例分析數值統計表	 67 圖目錄 圖 2 - 1 淺層土壤破壞剖面示意圖	 5 圖 2 - 2 現地邊坡淺層土壤破壞情形	 5 圖 2 - 3 土石流破壞示意圖	 7 圖 2 - 4 三義火炎山 130 甲線發生土石流災變圖	 7 圖 2 - 5 土壤沖蝕破壞情形	 9 圖 2 - 6 近圓弧形滑動破壞示意圖	 11 圖 2 - 7 近圓弧形滑動破壞現場情形	 11 圖 2 - 8 邊坡潛變位移破壞示意圖	 13 圖 2 - 9 山區公路邊坡潛變位移破壞情形	 13 圖 2 - 10 順向坡滑動破壞剖面示意圖	 15 圖 2 - 11 九份二山順向坡滑動破壞情形	 15 圖 2 - 12 落石示意圖	 17 圖 2 - 13 現場落石情形	 17 圖 2 - 14 擋土牆設計流程圖	 23 圖 2 - 15 重力式擋土牆斷面圖	 24 圖 2 - 16 古棧道	 27 圖 2 - 17 棧道使用現況圖	 27 圖 2 - 18 造成路幅不足之災害原因分析圖	 28 圖 2 - 19 棧橋式修復示意圖	 30 圖 2 - 20 棧橋式粱斷面結構分析	 31 圖 4 - 1 初始應力場形成	 40 圖 4 - 2 施設工字梁	 41 圖 4 - 3 增加均佈靜載重	 41 圖 4 - 4 增加車行集中載重	 42 圖 4 - 5 案例一整體變形圖	 43 圖 4 - 6 案例一最大主應力分佈圖	 44 圖 4 - 7 案例一工字梁垂直變位圖	 44 圖 4 - 8 案例一工字梁彎矩圖	 45 圖 4 - 9 案例一工字梁剪力圖	 45 圖 4 - 10 案例二整體變形圖	 46 圖 4 - 11 案例二最大主應力分佈圖	 47 圖 4 - 12 案例二工字梁垂直變位圖	 47 圖 4 - 13 案例二工字梁彎矩圖	 48 圖 4 - 14 案例二工字梁剪力圖	 48 圖 4 - 15 案例三整體變形圖	 49 圖 4 - 16 案例三最大主應力分佈圖	 50 圖 4 - 17 案例二工字梁垂直變形圖	 50 圖 4 - 18 案例三工字梁彎矩圖	 51 圖 4 - 19 案例三工字梁剪力圖	 51 圖 4 - 20 案例四整體變形圖	 52 圖 4 - 21 案例四最大主應力分佈圖	 53 圖 4 - 22 案例四工字梁垂直變形圖	 53 圖 4 - 23 案例四工字梁彎矩圖	 54 圖 4 - 24 案例四工字梁剪力圖	 54 圖 4 - 25 案例五整體變形圖	 55 圖 4 - 26 案例五最大主應力分佈圖	 56 圖 4 - 27 案例五工字梁垂直變形圖	 56 圖 4 - 28 案例五工字梁彎矩圖	 57 圖 4 - 29 案例五工字梁剪力圖	 57 圖 4 - 30 案例六整體變形圖	 58 圖 4 - 31 案例六最大主應力分佈圖	 59 圖 4 - 32 案例六工字梁垂直變形圖	 59 圖 4 - 33 案例六工字梁彎矩圖	 60 圖 4 - 34 案例六工字梁剪力圖	 60 圖 4 - 35 案例七整體變形圖	 61 圖 4 - 36 案例七最大主應力分佈圖	 62 圖 4 - 37 案例七工字梁垂直變形圖	 62 圖 4 - 38 案例七工字梁彎矩圖	 63 圖 4 - 39 案例七工字梁剪力圖	 63 圖 4 - 40 案例八整體變形圖	 64 圖 4 - 41 案例八最大主應力分佈圖	 65 圖 4 - 42 案例八工字梁垂直變形圖	 65 圖 4 - 43 案例八工字梁垂直變形圖	 66 圖 4 - 44 案例八工字梁剪力圖	 6...|$|E

Rojan tells Kirk that the Kelvans originate from the Andromeda Galaxy, and have come to find planets suitable for conquest in the Milky Way Galaxy. Because their own ship was destroyed, they need the Enterprise to make the 300-year return journey. Three other Kelvans transport aboard the Enterprise, and quickly {{gain control of the}} ship.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, Wevers competed at the Ljubljana World Cup in April, where a fall {{on balance}} <b>beam</b> <b>landed</b> her in fourth place. At the European Championships, she {{qualified}} to the uneven bars and balance beam finals. She won a bronze on bars, but fell {{on one of}} her spins on beam and finished her routine well over her allotted 90 seconds. She finished eighth.|$|R

50|$|The Microwave Scanning <b>Beam</b> <b>Landing</b> System (MSBLS) is a Ku band {{approach}} and landing navigation aid formerly used by NASA's space shuttle. It provides precise elevation, directional and distance data which was used to guide the orbiter {{for the last two}} minutes of flight until touchdown. The signal is typically usable from a horizontal distance of approximately 28 km and from an altitude of approximately 5 km (18,000 feet).|$|R
5000|$|The gymnast has a {{signature}} move, called [...] "The Dick." [...] The Dick is a balance beam skill officially {{recognized in the}} Code of Points by the Federation Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG). Using a springboard {{to jump into the}} air, the gymnast <b>lands</b> on the <b>beam</b> in a perfect split to begin the routine. The move made its official debut at the world gymnastics competition held in Glasgow, Scotland.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>landing</b> party <b>beams</b> {{down and}} finds {{the area to}} be a lush and {{breathable}} environment, contradicting Jaeger's original scans {{that the world was}} barren and couldn't support life. They also come across {{what appears to be a}} medieval castle constructed in the middle of nowhere. They find Captain Kirk and Lt. Sulu immobilised, just before discovering a brash and impetuous being who identifies himself as [...] "General Trelane, Retired" [...] who soon returns Kirk and Sulu back to normal. McCoy's medical tricorder does not get any readings from Trelane and according to the scanner nothing is there. Trelane invites everyone to stay as his guests on his world he calls Gothos and discuss his favorite subject: the military history of Earth.|$|R
6000|$|One warm {{night during}} {{my first visit to}} the group, our ship was {{floating}} along in languid stillness, when some one on the forecastle shouted [...] "Light ho!" [...] We looked and saw a beacon burning on some obscure <b>land</b> off the <b>beam.</b> Our third mate was not intimate with this part of the world. Going to the captain he said, [...] "Sir, shall I put off in a boat? These must be shipwrecked men." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{microwave}} scanning <b>beam</b> <b>landing</b> system (MSBLS) is {{the primary}} position sensor of the Orbiter's navigation subsystem during the autoland phase of the flight. Portions of the system are discussed with special emphasis placed on potential problem areas as referenced to the Orbiter's mission. Topics discussed include system compatability, system accuracy, and expected RF signal levels. A block and flow diagram of MSBLS system operation is included {{with a list of}} special tests required to determine system performance...|$|R
40|$|Beginning in July of 1976, {{flight tests}} {{have been on}} the Microwave Scanning <b>Beam</b> <b>Landing</b> System (MSBLS) built for NASA. The MSBLS is {{designed}} to supply accurate guidance information to the Space Shuttle as it returns from orbit to an aircraft-type runway. Because of the broad coverage (30 by 30 degrees) and high accuracy (0. 05 degree in angle, 100 feet in range) of the MSBLS, a flexible reference system with higher accuracy was required. The laser tracker has been fulfilling this requirement...|$|R
40|$|The {{microwave}} Scanning <b>Beam</b> <b>Landing</b> System's (MSBLS) {{performance in}} fog and rain was studied. The fog and rain {{effects on the}} Shuttle Ku-band system were determined. Specifically, microwave attenuation, beam distortion, and coordinate errors resulting from operation of the MSBLS in poor weather conditions were evaluated. The main physical processes giving rise to microwave attenuation {{were found to be}} absorption and scattering by water droplets. The general theory of scattering and absorption used is discussed and a listing of applicable computer programs is provided...|$|R
