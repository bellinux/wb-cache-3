5|$|After a {{prolonged}} power struggle, Khrushchev was finally ousted {{from his post}} as First Secretary in October 1964, charged with the failure of his reforms, his obsessive re-organizations of the Party and Government apparatus, his disregard for Party and Government institutions, and his one-man domineering <b>leadership</b> <b>style.</b> The Presidium (Politburo), the Central Committee and other important Party–Government bodies had grown tired of Khrushchev's repeated violations of established Party principles. The Soviet leadership also believed that his individualistic <b>leadership</b> <b>style</b> ran contrary to the ideal collective leadership. Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin succeeded Khrushchev in his posts as First Secretary and Premier respectively, and Mikhail Suslov, Andrei Kirilenko, and Anastas Mikoyan (replaced in 1965 by Nikolai Podgorny), were also given prominence in the new leadership.

40|$|Purpose – Full-range {{leadership}} {{theory and}} power-and-influence approaches to leadership emerge from different theoretical traditions, but may overlap conceptually and practically. Previous {{research has found}} connections between full-range <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> and leaders' influencing behaviors. However, this research has been conceptually and methodologically limited, neither examining all full-range <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> nor all common influence tactics, and measuring only employees' perceptions. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to address these limitations. Design/methodology/approach – Follower-rated <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> and influence tactics, and leader-rated <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> were surveyed for 160 pairs of leaders and followers (n= 320). Findings – Core influence tactics and apprising were correlated with, and predicted, follower-rated transformational and transactional leadership, but confirmatory factor analysis provided a more nuanced view of these relationships. Rational persuasion (negatively) predicted passive-avoidant leadership. There were few significant correlations between leader-self-rated <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> and followers' ratings of leaders' influence tactics. Originality/value – This study extends upon previous studies by more comprehensively connecting full-range <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> and influence tactics, and doing so with both leader-rated and follower-rated <b>leadership</b> <b>styles.</b> The results help to provide a clearer picture of the overlap between full-range and power-and-influence theories of leadership. The mismatches between results from leader-rated and follower-rated <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> raise conceptual, practical, and methodological questions for future research...|$|R

The purpose of this paper was twofold, to shed light on employees’ job satisfaction under the leadership of expatriate managers as well as the differences in <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> of local and expatriate managers. Results showed that transformational <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> such as; idealized influence (behavior), intellectual stimulation, inspirational motivation had a significant positive effect on employees job satisfaction. Even transactional <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> of expatriates such as contingent reward produced significant positive effect on employees job satisfaction. However transactional leadership of management by exception (passive) of expatriate managers had a significant negative effect on job satisfaction. The combination of five <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> of expatriate managers, was able to produce 92. 2 % of employees’ job satisfaction. Except for management by exception (passive), the other four <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> had a positive effect on job satisfaction. Results further revealed that expatriate managers have different <b>leadership</b> <b>styles,</b> with higher individual consideration, and contingent reward score, but lower management by exception (passive) score compared to local managers.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show empirically how {{knowledge}} management, particularly knowledge integration (KI), acts as a mediator between different <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> and Enterprise Systems (ES) success. It proposes a model of KI as a mediator between two <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> (the transformational and transactional <b>leadership</b> <b>styles).</b> The study also aims to expose the most relevant <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> to be practiced by leaders when managing the ES post-implementation stage. Design/methodology/approach – Valid data were collected from 263 survey respondents in Malaysian companies. The authors employed structural equation modelling and used the path modelling approach to investigate the underlying relationships between the variables. The authors then tested the mediating effects of KI by using the bootstrapping procedures proposed by Preacher and Hayes, which suits the path analysis method. Findings – The results provide empirical evidence on the relationships between the variables and on the role of KI mechanisms as a mediator between <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> and ES success, especially in the ES post-implementation phase. Both <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> have to be practiced by leaders while managing an ES. Research limitations/implications – Future research can investigate the role of KI mechanisms as moderators between both <b>leadership</b> <b>styles.</b> The study can also be expanded by looking in-depth at other <b>leadership</b> <b>styles.</b> Practical implications – This paper is useful for management researchers and as a guide to management practice for business managers. Originality/value – This paper proposes a model that examines the vitality of KI effect in ES postimplementation stage by different <b>leadership</b> <b>styles.</b> The results expose the importance of leaders’ adoption of KI mechanisms and call for manager attention to the importance of using the right <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> when managing ES...|$|R

40|$|The culture {{demonstrates}} {{itself in}} the shared values, attitudes, beliefs, norms and behaviours of people and it is distinguished from each other by differences in those shared meanings of people interacting. As culture is varied across countries, <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> are also varied across countries and are not exercised {{in the same way}} across different cultures. They are imported in accordance with the cultural environment in which they are perceived. Therefore, understanding the culture is significant in order to explain preferences of leaders concerning <b>leadership</b> <b>styles.</b> The main purpose of the present dissertation is to provide an overview of the relationship between Turkish culture {{and the way in which}} leadership is exercised by Turkish female leaders. The present study is completed in three steps in order to demonstrate that the existing relationship between the Turkish culture and <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> of female leaders in Turkey. In the first step, the study examined what culture is, what dimensions of the national culture are, what leadership is and how <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> are culturally-linked. In the second step, the paper investigated how female leaders perceive and exercise different <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> across different cultures. In the third step, the study researched what cornerstones of Turkish culture and how anticipated <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> of Turkish female leaders are shaped by Turkish culture.      The study followed a qualitative research approach based on the grounded theory. Ten female leaders coming from different backgrounds were interviewed in order to draw a holistic picture of the relationship between Turkish cultural values and <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> of Turkish female leaders. The findings of the study indicate that the Turkish culture has an influence on <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> of Turkish female leaders. According to the results, while Islamic values have no significant impact on leadership behaviours of female leaders, such cultural attributes as collectivism, high power distance, uncertainty avoidance and paternalism have a huge impact on <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> of Turkish female leaders.        The research examined only <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> of Turkish female leaders. Therefore, this study recommends a future research which will investigate <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> of Turkish males in order to understand whether gender has also an effect on <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> of Turkish leaders. ...|$|R

Specifically, the study sought to determine the relationship between <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> and organisational commitment. Over the past decades, several studies {{examined the relationship between}} these concepts. In fact, extant literature suggested a strong correlation between <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> and organisational commitment in different sectors, without specific reference to the gas sector. Accordingly, this study focused on determining the <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> that leaders in the gas sector demonstrate to ensure organisational commitment. This study utilised a mixed methods approach. The instrument that was used for collecting quantitative data was developed by the modifying scales utilised by other authorities. It comprised of 21 items plotted on a 5 -point Likert scale ranging from strongly agree to disagree strongly. The items focused on <b>leadership</b> <b>styles.</b> In contrast, the section for qualitative data comprised of 6 open-ended items. The instrument was e-mailed to participants via SurveyMonkey. A total of n= 61 questionnaires were completed and returned via SurveyMonkey. In analysing the quantitative data, SPSS was utilised. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the profiles of participants. A factor analysis involving principal component extraction and varimax rotation was performed, resulting in a 2 -factor solution that relates to democratic and transformational <b>leadership</b> <b>styles.</b> The qualitative data were collected involving n= 10 participants. Themes were developed from textual data and then analysed. The ‗describe-compare-relate‘ technique was utilised to present and report on the findings. The study found that there is a correlation between management <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> and organisational commitment by employees. As such, <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> directly influence the extent to which employees commit to their employer organisation. The study also found that management at Afrox apply the democratic and transformational <b>leadership</b> iv <b>styles.</b> The findings raise important insights as to which <b>leadership</b> <b>style(s)</b> management need to demonstrate and how management can optimise their <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> to benefit their organisation.

5|$|However, Bruce {{soon became}} embroiled in the {{disputes}} over Churchill's autocratic <b>leadership</b> <b>style</b> and {{his lack of}} consultation with the cabinet over war decisions. He was regularly left out of cabinet communique or not invited to meetings, much to his displeasure. With the fear of Japanese invasion mounting in Australia throughout 1942, Bruce directly confronted Churchill {{on a number of}} occasions over Far East policy and the continuing lack of consultation with Australia and his own cabinet. Churchill usually responded by rebuffing him or pointedly excluding him further from government business. Although outwardly relenting in the face of pressure exerted by the dominions for representation in war decisions, Churchill routinely marginalised or ignored that representation. Bruce persisted in this difficult arrangement until May 1944 when he became completely disillusioned and resigned, choosing other forums in which to represent Australia in London. In spite of his tempestuous relationship with Churchill, Bruce was held in high regard by many cabinet members, particularly future prime ministers Clement Attlee and Anthony Eden, and his dogged determination to advance dominion interests during the war years earned him high praise from John Curtin and the other dominion prime ministers.|$|E

The spectacle was covered by a live state radio broadcast, with commentary by longtime party member and future Minister of Aviation Hermann Göring. Goebbels was disappointed to not be given a post in Hitler's new cabinet. Bernhard Rust was appointed as Minister of Culture, the post Goebbels was expecting to receive. Like other NSDAP officials, Goebbels had to deal with Hitler's <b>leadership</b> <b>style</b> of giving contradictory orders to his subordinates, while placing them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped. In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. The NSDAP took advantage of the Reichstag fire of 27 February 1933, with Hindenburg passing the Reichstag Fire Decree the following day at Hitler's urging. This was the first of several pieces of legislation that dismantled democracy in Germany and put a totalitarian dictatorship—headed by Hitler—in its place.
