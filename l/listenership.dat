Smooth continued to increase its audience share in the second quarter of 2011, with an average weekly total of 3.2 million, which rose once again in the third quarter to 3.328 million, meaning that for the first time Smooth's figures overtook those of one of its national rivals, talkSPORT. The station had an audience of 3.3 million in {{the final quarter}} of 2011, making it the second most listened to national commercial radio station in the UK. 3,317,000 listeners were tuning in during the first quarter of 2012, which dropped slightly in the second quarter to 3.2 million. The third quarter of 2012 saw another small drop to 3.19 million, but in the same period Smooth 70s recorded its first audience figures of 749,000. Collectively 3.7 million listeners were tuning into Smooth-branded stations. That figure rose to 3.8 million in the final quarter of the year. The first quarter of 2013 saw an average weekly audience of 3.6 million, which fell to 3.1 million for the second quarter. However, figures rose again through the second half of the year, with 3.26 million in the third quarter of 2013, and 3.38 million in the fourth.|$|E
25|$|After {{finishing}} The Tubridy Show on 16 July 2010, {{he began}} presenting Tubridy on RTÉ 2fm on 20 August 2010, surprising listeners by starting the programme three days earlier {{that what was}} originally scheduled for 23 August. His first guest on the programme was Bono. His RTÉ Radio 1 slot was filled by John Murray. Tubridy became synonymous with declining <b>listenership</b> figures, a 40% collapse of which by 2011 coincided with increased <b>listenership</b> figures for its rival The Ray D'Arcy Show.|$|E

25|$|Tubridy sacrificed his Christmas {{holidays}} in 2011 to {{work for}} the BBC again, this time as a replacement for Ken Bruce on Radio 2. Amid constant media criticism related to declining <b>listenership</b> and viewership figures, he has been receiving support from Chris Evans and has been defended by Vincent Browne. Tubridy has also stood in for Chris Evans on the Radio 2 Breakfast Show, and Simon Mayo on the Radio 2 drivetime slot. In 2015, he has also stood in on Terry Wogan's weekend show on Sunday.|$|E
25|$|Development of the {{new program}} was funded by a special grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, in November 2002. The show debuted nationally on October 6, 2003. Exploring Music in essence {{replaced}} Karl Haas' long-running show, Adventures in Good Music, since the aging and retired Haas had recorded no new episodes of his show after 2002. When encore broadcasts of Adventures in Good Music ceased entirely on June 29, 2007, Exploring Music gained an even wider national <b>listenership,</b> {{as it was then}} scheduled in the retired show's time slot on many radio stations.|$|E

Moyles again increased his audience to 7.72million as of 1 May 2008 slightly narrowing the gap between him and Terry Wogan, the current highest rated radio show in the UK. The station's overall listener figure is now over 11million.|$|E
25|$|Chizek got {{his start}} in radio at Youngstown State University in 1964. Then, after a five-year stint at Youngstown's WBBW, Howie Chizek started hosting a talk radio show in the Akron, Ohio, market on WNIR FM-100.1. He began {{broadcasting}} with WNIR, then WKNT, on June 3, 1974, and remained there {{until his death in}} 2012. Chizek had the longest-running, no-guest talk radio show in America. Throughout that time, the show had included a <b>listenership</b> of over 300,000. It ran six days a week, from Monday through Saturday. His talk show aired 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Monday through Friday and 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. on Saturday. Chizek's success is credited with allowing WNIR to be the first FM station in America to go all-talk in 1979. Listeners heard The Howie Chizek Show for 38 years on-the-air from Cleveland to Canton and, in more recent years, around the world via online streaming.|$|E
25|$|Gallatin {{received}} its first local {{radio station in}} August 1948 when WHIN 1010 AM, went on the air. Owned at one time by record mogul Randy Wood, the station still serves Sumner County with country music, local sports, and coverage of NASCAR racing. WHIN was joined by an FM station in December 1960 when 104.5 came on the air. The FM station has broadcast under many call letters, but probably its most famous days were in the late 1970s and 1980s when it was known as KX (pronounced Kicks) 104, a popular music station that battled with Nashville stations for top <b>listenership.</b> During that time the station was owned by Ron Bledsoe, who for years had commanded CBS Records in Nashville, and was a former employee of the station in his younger years. Currently the station is Citadel-owned sports radio station WGFX, which targets the Nashville market and is the flagship station for the Tennessee Titans and Tennessee Volunteers.|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} first {{broadcast}} on BBC Radio 4 at 10.30pm on Wednesday 8 March 1978. Simon Jones recalled that Adams was initially disappointed at the scheduling as the timeslot was allegedly guaranteed {{to turn a}} programme into a [...] "cult" [...] (i.e. a small but dedicated <b>listenership).</b> As it happened, the programme gained listeners through {{the lack of any}} competition elsewhere on television or radio, but primarily through word of mouth; several Sunday newspapers included reviews and it was mentioned in Radio 4's Pick of the Week. As a result of its exposure through these reviews, the BBC received numerous requests for a repeat from people who had missed the initial episodes. A repeat of the series was broadcast on 23 April, only two weeks after the last episode had aired.|$|E
500|$|Nelson's {{strategy}} {{was the most}} focused on the Third District: his campaign's goal was to minimize his losing margin in Omaha and Lincoln, while winning heavily in rural Nebraska. [...] His advantage in funding proved important in this. [...] While Hoppner relied on television advertising on stations in Omaha, Lincoln, Grand Island, Hastings, Kearney, and North Platte, Nelson bought advertising in all of those markets and also on Sioux City, Iowa television, which reached northeastern Nebraska, and on radio station KRVN in Lexington, Nebraska, with a large <b>listenership</b> in rural central and western Nebraska. [...] To reach more voters who were outside of the areas covered by the eastern and central television stations, he staged a direct-mail campaign, sending up to three letters to registered Democrats in rural areas near the state's northern, southern, and western borders.|$|E
500|$|The renewed warfare had two {{effects on}} the {{domestic}} situation in Rwanda itself. The first was a resurgence of violence against Tutsi still residing in the country. Hutu activists killed up to 1,000 Tutsi in attacks authorised by local officials, starting with the slaughter of 30–60 Bagogwe Tutsi pastoralists near Kinigi, and then moving south and west to Ruhengeri and Gisenyi. These attacks continued until June 1991, when a deal was reached to allow potential victims to move to safer areas. The akazu also began a major propaganda campaign, broadcasting and publishing material designed to persuade the Hutu population that the Tutsi were a separate and alien people. This included the Hutu Ten Commandments, a set of [...] "rules", published in the Kangura magazine, mandating Hutu supremacy {{in all aspects of}} Rwandan life. In response, the RPF opened its own propaganda radio station, Radio Muhabura, which broadcast from Uganda into Rwanda; this was never hugely popular, but gained <b>listenership</b> through 1992 and 1993.|$|E
2500|$|Morning Ireland is the {{top rated}} radio {{programme}} in the Republic of Ireland, with a <b>listenership</b> estimated by the Joint National <b>Listenership</b> Survey to be 467,000. It is considered the most influential news programme on Irish radio. When ratings for the radio shows of prominent RTÉ broadcasters such as Joe Duffy, Pat Kenny and Gerry Ryan were declining in 2005, Morning Ireland remained Ireland's most popular radio programme. It was at one point rivalled by The Full Irish in second place [...] before that show ended.|$|E
2500|$|NPR {{stations}} {{generally do}} not subscribe to the Arbitron rating service and {{are not included in}} published ratings and rankings such as Radio & Records. However, NPR station <b>listenership</b> is measured by Arbitron in both Diary and PPM (people meter) markets. NPR stations are frequently not included in [...] "summary level" [...] diary data used by most advertising agencies for media planning. Data on NPR listening can be accessed using [...] "respondent level" [...] diary data. Additionally, all radio stations (public and commercial) are treated equally within the PPM data sets making NPR station <b>listenership</b> data much more widely available to the media planning community. According to Arbitron's National Broadcast Audience Estimate report for September 29, 2011, NPR's signature morning news program, Morning Edition, is the network's most popular program, drawing 12.9 million listeners a week, with its afternoon newsmagazine, All Things Considered, a close second, with 12.2 million listeners a week. Arbitron data is also provided by Radio Research Consortium, a non-profit corporation which subscribes to the Arbitron service and distributes the data to NPR and other non-commercial stations and on its website.|$|E

2500|$|BBC World Service is the world's largest {{international}} broadcaster, broadcasting in 27 languages to {{many parts}} of the world via analogue and digital shortwave, internet streaming and podcasting, satellite, FM and MW relays. It is politically independent (by mandate of the Agreement providing details of the topics outlined in the BBC Charter), non-profit, and commercial-free. The English language service had always had a UK <b>listenership</b> on LW and therefore DAB Services allowed, by this popular demand, it to be now available 24/7 for this audience in better quality reception.

2500|$|Because of AM {{radio signal}} reach, {{nighttime}} hosts enjoyed a <b>listenership</b> at considerable distances {{such as the}} former head of the Virginia Chapter of the NAACP, host Jack Gravely, whose evening show was heard hundreds of miles away well into neighboring states overnight. An overnight country music program headed by [...] "Big John" [...] Trimble targeted truckers in the 1970s, again taking advantage of the large nighttime coverage area of the clear channel station. Broadcasting from a remote studio located at Jarrell's Truck Stop in Doswell, Virginia, the show ran for eighteen years. [...] It made Big John into a national radio personality.|$|E
2500|$|Twenty-five years ago, Ramsey {{started his}} radio career by co-hosting the show The Money Game with Roy Matlock of Primerica. Over time, that local show on one {{radio station in}} Nashville turned into The Dave Ramsey Show. With a {{combined}} <b>listenership</b> of over 12 million weekly, the show is available on more than 575 radio stations, a dedicated YouTube channel, SiriusXM, iHeartRadio, a podcast on iTunes and Google Play, and a video channel on daveramsey.com.

[...] Cumulus also owns popular country station WFBE (which for many years was a classical-music public radio station owned by the Flint school system), as well as sports-talker WTRX and Saginaw/Bay City's WHNN (96.1 FM, Oldies) and WIOG (102.5 FM, Top 40), which both have good signals and significant <b>listenership</b> in Flint.|$|E
2500|$|References {{to records}} or songs being [...] "banned" [...] in Ireland refer {{to one or}} more radio {{stations}} refusing to play the songs rather than any legislative ban, although before 1989 {{it may have been a}} moot point given that the only legal broadcasting stations in Ireland were those operated by state broadcaster RTÉ. In the 1930s there was even a short-lived airplay ban on an entire genre of music known as the [...] "ban on Jazz" [...] (with an exceptionally wide definition of what constituted [...] "jazz"). Such bans only served to further increase <b>listenership</b> to foreign radio stations (such as Radio Luxembourg and the BBC) in Ireland, and led to the growth of Irish pirate radio.|$|E
2500|$|Rock {{and roll}} {{was soon to}} become the most {{important}} component of American popular music, beginning with the rockabilly boom of the 1950s. [...] In the following decade, gospel evolved into secular soul. [...] Rock, country and soul, mixed with each other and occasionally other styles, spawned a legion of subgenres over the next few decades, ranging from heavy metal to punk and funk. [...] In the 1970s, urban African Americans in New York City began performing spoken lyrics over a beat provided by an emcee; this became known as hip hop music. [...] By the dawn of the 21st century, hip hop had become a part of most recorded American popular music, and by the 2010s had surpassed rock music in overall <b>listenership.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1969-70, the {{partners}} Meister and Bollier established a commercial Offshore Radio [...] Station, Radio Nordsee International (RNI), in international waters aboard the radio ship Mebo II, anchored off Scheveningen,The Netherlands. Transmissions to Northwest Europe began in January, 1970. By 1971, the station {{had established a}} large <b>listenership,</b> especially in the Netherlands, its programs broadcast simultaneously on mediumwave (105kW), shortwave (2 X 10kW), and FM (1kW). After transmissions ceased in 1974, and a lengthy legal battle with the Dutch government over its impounding of the vessel, in 1977 the Mebo II sailed for Tripoli, Libya, where it was initially leased to the Libyan government {{for use as a}} radio station; then later sunk during military target practice in the Gulf of Sidra. The deal marked the beginning of a long business relationship with Libya.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} of his death, Romero had built up an {{enormous}} following among Salvadorans. He did this largely through broadcasting his weekly sermons across El Salvador on the Church's station, YSAX, [...] "except when it was bombed off the air." [...] In these sermons, he listed disappearances, tortures, murders, and much more each Sunday. This was followed by an hour-long speech on radio the following day. On the importance of these broadcasts, one writer noted that [...] "the archbishop's Sunday sermon was the main source in El Salvador about what was happening. It was estimated to have the largest <b>listenership</b> of any programme in the country." [...] According to listener surveys, 73% of the rural population and 37% of the urban listened regularly. Similarly, his diocesan weekly paper Orientación carried lists of cases of torture and repression every week.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2009, [...] "The Mic" [...] made a {{schedule}} change that {{was greeted with}} more controversy, replacing Thom Hartmann's afternoon program with The Dave Ramsey Show, a program that is more known for financial advice and at times displays a conservative viewpoint. [...] Though station management said the move was intended to broaden the station's <b>listenership</b> and {{not to make a}} wholesale change in political ideology, complaints from listeners and a few advertisers prompted WXXM to return Hartmann's show to the 2-5PM slot, while moving Ramsey's show to the 5-8AM slot in place of Lee Rayburn (Rayburn left the station by his own choosing earlier in the month, in part due to the direction he felt the station was taking by adding Ramsey's show). [...] The Dave Ramsey Show would have a short stay on [...] "The Mic," [...] with the syndicated Bill Press Show replacing it one month after its debut on WXXM (Ramsey would later move to WIBA's late night schedule).|$|E
