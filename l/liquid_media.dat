5|$|In the laboratory, {{bacteria}} are usually grown using solid or <b>liquid</b> <b>media.</b> Solid growth media, such as agar plates, {{are used to}} isolate pure cultures of a bacterial strain. However, liquid growth media are used when measurement of growth or large volumes of cells are required. Growth in stirred <b>liquid</b> <b>media</b> occurs as an even cell suspension, making the cultures easy to divide and transfer, although isolating single bacteria from <b>liquid</b> <b>media</b> is difficult. The use of selective media (media with specific nutrients added or deficient, or with antibiotics added) can help identify specific organisms.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of cysts is induced {{by changes in}} the concentration of nutrients in the medium and addition of some organic substances such as ethanol, n-butanol, or β-hydroxybutyrate. Cysts are rarely formed in <b>liquid</b> <b>media.</b> The {{formation of}} cysts is induced by chemical factors and is accompanied by metabolic shifts, changes in catabolism, respiration, and biosynthesis of macromolecules; it is also affected by aldehyde dehydrogenase and the response regulator AlgR.|$|E

Most contain spores of the heat resistant microbe Geobacillus stearothermophilus (formerly Bacillus stearothermophilus), which is extremely resistant to steam sterilization. Biological indicators may take the form of glass vials of spores and <b>liquid</b> <b>media,</b> or as spores on strips of paper inside glassine envelopes. These indicators are placed in locations where it is difficult for steam to reach to verify that steam is penetrating there.|$|E

2500|$|Bartonella {{growth rates}} improve when cultured in an {{enrichment}} inoculation {{step in a}} liquid insect-based medium [...] such as Bartonella α-Proteobacteria Growth Medium (BAPGM) [...] or Schneider’s Drosophila-based insect powder medium. Several studies have optimized the growing conditions of Bartonella spp. cultures in these <b>liquid</b> <b>media,</b> with no change in bacterial protein expressions or host interactions in vitro. Insect-based <b>liquid</b> <b>media</b> supports the growth and co-culturing of at least seven Bartonella species, reduces bacterial culturing time and facilitates PCR detection and isolation of Bartonella spp. from animal and patient samples. Research shows that DNA may be detected following direct extraction from blood samples and become negative following enrichment culture, thus PCR is recommended after direct sample extraction and also following incubation in enrichment culture. Several studies have successfully optimized sensitivity and specificity by using PCR amplification (pre-enrichment PCR) and enrichment culturing of blood draw samples, followed by PCR (post-enrichment PCR) and DNA sequence identification.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{distinctive}} additions to the engine is <b>liquid</b> <b>media</b> in which the player can enter and swim. There are four types of media: water, sewage, lava and goo, the latter two being harmful to the player's health when entered. While submerged, the player can move around, use the run key to swim upward and out, or use his fists or fusion pistol (although use of such will backfire and harm the player). The player moves slower while under media than upon the surface, and loses oxygen, and while under lava or Pfhor goo, also loses health. Each pool of <b>liquid</b> <b>media</b> has its own dynamics such as flow direction, speed, viscosity and high/low tide, {{and in some cases}} the player can modify a media's tide level.
