5000|$|According to the {{subsequent}} United States Coast Guard {{report on the}} accident, Menzies, <b>Link</b> <b>and</b> Stover [...] "displayed an incredible casualness in their preparations for Dive 130, considering the inherent hazards of their operation." [...] Because <b>Link</b> <b>and</b> Stover were not planning to perform a lockout dive, they were dressed in shorts and T-shirts.

5000|$|Menzies and Meek could {{immediately}} {{be removed}} from the Sea <b>Link</b> <b>and</b> were transferred to the decompression chamber aboard the Tringa. However, with the divers compartment still pressurized, any attempt to remove <b>Link</b> <b>and</b> Stover would have been fatal to them, assuming they were still alive. The Sea Link was transferred aboard the Sea Diver. <b>Link</b> <b>and</b> Stover were visible through the diving compartments view ports but showed no evident vital signs. The compartment was force ventilated with a helium-oxygen mixture while remaining pressurized, and hot water was sprayed over it in an attempt to raise its internal temperature. On the morning of June 19, medical doctors concluded that <b>Link</b> <b>and</b> Stover were dead, and the compartment began to be depressurized. <b>Link</b> <b>and</b> Stover were brought to the Florida Keys Memorial Hospital on Key West, where their autopsies were performed.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{rudimentary}} taxonomy of interactive data visualization {{based on a}} triad of data analytic tasks: finding Gestalt, posing queries, and making comparisons. These tasks are supported by three classes of nteractive view manipulation: focusing, <b>linking</b> <b>and</b> arranging views. This discussion extends earlier work {{on the principles of}} focusing <b>and</b> <b>linking</b> <b>and</b> sets them on a firmer base. Next, we give a high-level introduction to a particular system for multivariate data visualization: XGobi. This introduction is not comprehensive but emphasizes XGobi tools that are examples of focusing, <b>linking</b> <b>and</b> arranging views, namely: high-dimensional projections, <b>linked</b> scatterplot brusing, <b>and</b> matrices of conditional plots...|$|R
5|$|After the First World War, the {{population}} of the west London suburbs continued to grow, thanks to improved rail transport <b>links</b> <b>and</b> the growth in ownership of automobiles. In 1925, the Ministry of Transport convened a conference between Surrey and Middlesex county councils with the aim of reaching a solution to the congestion problem, and the Great Chertsey Road scheme was revived. In 1927, the Royal Commission on Cross-River Traffic approved the scheme to relieve the by then chronic traffic congestion on the existing, mostly narrow, streets in the area, and on the narrow bridges at Richmond Bridge, Kew and Hammersmith. The Ministry of Transport agreed to pay heavy subsidies towards the cost.|$|E
5|$|British Open Championship Golf was {{the third}} self-published game {{released}} by Looking Glass Technologies. It was directed by Rex Bradford, designer of the early golf title Mean 18. The team sought to create an accurate simulation of tournament golf play, which they felt was missing in the genre. To achieve this goal, they focused on recreating the atmosphere of a tournament, and included reactive crowds and announcers. The game was placed in competition with popular golf series such as <b>Links</b> <b>and</b> PGA Tour.|$|E

Daredevil entered development in late 2013, with Goddard initially hired in December 2013. DeKnight replaced him as showrunner and Cox was hired to star in May 2014. Filmed in New York City from July to December 2014, the season focuses on the darker, more mature elements of the source material. Stephanie Maslansky designed the costumes for the season, with the final red suit for Daredevil designed by Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists at Marvel Studios.

5|$|En {{route to}} Sicily, sixty-five gliders {{released}} too early by the American and British towing aircraft {{crashed into the}} sea, drowning approximately 252 men. Of the remainder, only eighty-seven men arrived at the Pont Grande Bridge, although they successfully captured the bridge and held it beyond {{the time they were}} to be relieved. Finally, with their ammunition expended and only fifteen soldiers remaining unwounded, the Allied troops surrendered to Italian forces. The Italians, having gained control of the bridge, sought to destroy the structure, but were frustrated by troopers of the 1st Airlanding Brigade who had removed the previously attached explosive charges. Other troops from the brigade, who had landed elsewhere in Sicily, aided further by destroying communications <b>links</b> <b>and</b> capturing gun batteries.|$|E

5|$|Greater Manchester's {{railway network}} {{historically}} suffered from poor north–south connections {{due to the}} fact that Manchester's main railway stations, Piccadilly and Victoria, were built in the 1840s on peripheral locations outside Manchester City Centre. The central commercial district had no rail <b>links,</b> <b>and</b> over the years, a number of unsuccessful schemes were proposed to connect Manchester's rail termini. In the 1960s, transport design studies were undertaken to address the problems of increasing traffic congestion. A number of urban public transport schemes were evaluated for Manchester, including several types of monorail systems and metro-style systems.|$|E

30|$|Our {{numerical}} {{results have}} also investigated the scenario where a new link {{at the source}} becomes available for an existing frequency division relay network, and the power and bandwidth resources are to be reallocated. We have observed that the source node is encouraged to communicate over the best link by dedicating all resources when the new SR <b>link</b> <b>and</b> SD <b>link</b> are better (or worse) than the current SD <b>link</b> <b>and</b> SR <b>link.</b> Otherwise, it is beneficial to share resources between the current <b>link</b> <b>and</b> the new <b>link</b> to achieve the higher rate.|$|R
5|$|In May 2007, Npower {{announced}} {{plans to build a}} new £2billion clean coal power station on the site. The proposed station would have generated electricity using three 800MW advanced supercritical steam, high-efficiency coal-fired units, giving the station a total generation capacity of 2,400MW. This was one of two new coal-fired stations proposed by Npower in the UK. The site was chosen because of its readily available proximity to the national grid, its rail and port <b>links,</b> <b>and</b> its position next to the North Sea, which is useful for both cooling water, and as a potential CO2 storage site, where CO2 could be piped to oil and gas wells, and saline aquifers.|$|E
