5|$|Blamey {{was always}} {{interested}} in technical innovation, and was receptive to unorthodox ideas. He {{was instrumental in the}} adoption of the periscope rifle at Gallipoli, a device which he saw during an inspection of the front <b>line.</b> <b>He</b> arranged for the inventor, Lance Corporal W. C. B. Beech, to be seconded to division headquarters to develop the idea. Within a few days, the design was perfected and periscope rifles began to be used throughout the Australian trenches.|$|E
5|$|During Barkley's {{eight seasons}} in Philadelphia, {{he became a}} {{household}} name {{and was one of}} the few NBA players to have a figure published by Kenner's Starting Lineup toy <b>line.</b> <b>He</b> also had his own signature shoe line with Nike. His outspoken and aggressive play, however, resulted in some on-court incidents, notoriously a fight with Detroit Pistons center Bill Laimbeer in 1990, which drew a record total $162,500 fine.|$|E

When the attacks are broadcast to the base, Selfridge displays discomfort at the violence.|$|E

Waiting on a railway <b>line</b> <b>he</b> would bet on how many trains would pass through the opposite platform. how may carriages {{would be on the}} next one, how many carriage windows would be open. In a train he would produce a brass top stamped Put and Take—he paid or collected according to which way it fell when it stopped spinning.|$|E
5|$|Lapierre {{is known}} {{primarily}} as a checking forward, centring either {{the third or fourth}} <b>line.</b> <b>He</b> has a reputation as an agitator, distracting and provoking opposing players to take penalties. He plays with an aggressive edge and led all Canadiens forward in hits in his last full season with the club. Defensively responsible, he earns time on the penalty kill. In 2008–09, he ranked third on the Canadiens in average short handed time on ice per game.|$|E

Over the course of his professional rookie campaign, Torres was called up on four different occasions to the NHL.

Skating on the fourth <b>line,</b> <b>he</b> helped the Islanders to a 5–3 win. He notched his first point during a separate call-up on January 4, 2002, assisting on a goal by Mark Parrish during a 4–2 win against the Pittsburgh Penguins. It was his lone point with the Islanders over 15 NHL games that season.|$|E
5|$|Although not a {{director}} or significant shareholder {{of the new}} company, Pearson continued to promote the project {{over the next few}} years and use his influence to help the company raise the £1 million of capital needed for the construction of the <b>line.</b> <b>He</b> issued a pamphlet, A twenty minutes letter to the citizens of London, in favour of the Metropolitan Railway and City Station, encouraging investment and he even persuaded the City of London to invest on the basis that the railway would alleviate the City's congestion problems. Once the railway was in operation, the City sold its shares at a profit. By 1860, the funds had been collected and the final route decided. Work on the railway started; taking less than three years to excavate through some of the worst slums of Victorian London and under some of the busiest streets.|$|E
5|$|As 9 Staffel {{crossed the}} coast they were fired at by Royal Navy patrol boats. The machine gun fire was ineffective. However, the Royal Observer Corps Post K3, {{situated}} {{on top of}} Beachy Head, spotted the Dorniers. They immediately telephoned a warning to Observer Group Headquarters at Horsham and fighter sector stations in the area, including RAF Kenley. Wing Commander Thomas Prickman, the station commander at Kenley, noticed the low-flying Dornier plot appear on his situation map. They appeared to be heading away towards the west, and was unsure of their target. His controllers were organising Nos. 64 and 615 Squadrons to meet the high-altitude raid. Roth headed past Lewes until {{he picked up the}} Brighton–London rail <b>line.</b> <b>He</b> then turned north-west.|$|E

With this, Bolt became the first man in history to defend both the 100 m and 200 m Olympic sprint titles. He was dramatic in victory: in the final metres of the 200 m race, Bolt placed his fingers on his lips, gesturing to silence his critics, and after crossing the <b>line</b> <b>he</b> completed five push-ups – one for each of his Olympic gold medals.|$|E
5|$|Braham was not {{satisfied}} with his current score-rate and lack of action in September 1943. Consequently, he flew a number of missions against ground targets. Successful night fighter pilots were ordered {{not to engage in}} such activities that exposed them to excessive risk. On one particular mission he decided to hunt enemy rail transport after failing to find enemy aircraft. On the Dieppe to Paris <b>line</b> <b>he</b> intercepted a locomotive which exploded after being hit. He attacked another but struck some trees which damaged the underside of the fuselage. Braham maintained control and flew home. It was not unusual for him to return with strange defections caused by collisions with objects. After one sortie against shipping the armourers were drenched in salt water and seaweed when they opened the panel housing the cannons with the intention of replacing spent ammunition.|$|E

A week after finishing the Tour de Suisse, {{he won his first}} Swiss national road racing crown on 28 June after outsprinting Mathias Frank at the <b>line.</b> <b>He</b> continued to win in July, as he won the opening stage of the Tour de France and took the first yellow jersey of the race.

The battle was brief: Maxentius' troops were broken before the first charge. Maxentius' horse guards and praetorians initially held their position, but broke under {{the force of a}} Constantinian cavalry charge; they also broke ranks and fled to the river. Maxentius rode with them, and attempted to cross the bridge of boats, but he was pushed by the mass of his fleeing soldiers into the Tiber, and drowned.|$|E
