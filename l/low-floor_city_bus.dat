50|$|In 2003, TEDOM {{acquired}} the JAMOT plant (an engine works plant in Jablonec) in an auction sale. It {{was a former}} facility of LIAZ s.r.o. in Jablonec nad Nisou. The engine manufacturing plant became {{an integral part of}} TEDOM s.r.o. as a separate motors division. Consequently, the production of <b>low-floor</b> <b>city</b> buses was started in 2004 and the TEDOM <b>city</b> <b>bus</b> prototype was introduced equipped with a TEDOM engine that burned compressed natural gas (CNG). The 1000th CHP unit made under the TEDOM mark was installed in the same year as well.|$|R

50|$|Tata Marcopolo is a bus-manufacturing {{joint venture}} between Tata Motors (51%) and the Brazil-based Marcopolo S.A. (49%). The joint venture {{manufactures}} and assembles fully built buses and coaches targeted at developing mass rapid transportation systems. It uses technology and expertise in chassis and aggregates from Tata Motors, and know-how in processes and systems for bodybuilding and bus body design from Marcopolo. Tata Marcopolo has launched a <b>low-floor</b> <b>city</b> <b>bus</b> which is widely used by transport corporations in many Indian cities.

50|$|In 2004, TEDOM's Bus Division started {{production}} of a <b>low-floor</b> <b>city</b> <b>bus</b> driven by a natural gas engine. The company obtained the necessary know-how by buying the licence from the Italian manufacturer Mauri. Thus, in 2004 TEDOM became the third bus manufacturer in the Czech Republic after Karosa (Iveco Czech Republic since 2007) and SOR Libchavy. A new manufacturing plant was built in Třebíč in connection with these business activities. However, of the originally planned manufacture of a thousand pieces, the new manufacturing plant was able to produce no more than about 200 buses that were delivered mainly to the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Germany. Due {{to a lack of}} job orders, TEDOM decided to terminate bus production in January 2012.|$|E

50|$|The 4-series bus {{range was}} first {{presented}} in September 1996, when the integral <b>low-floor</b> <b>city</b> <b>bus</b> OmniCity was revealed. Production of the chassis range started in {{second half of}} 1997, {{and by the end}} of 1998 all worldwide production facilities had changed from 3-series to 4-series. Unlike the 3-series, which was a range of 45 different chassis models, the 4-series is one basic chassis with different modular configurations depending on usage and customer needs. At launch there were a total of seven major configurations, presumably the F HB, K EB, K IB, L IB, L UB, N UA and N UB. These were later followed by the F HA, K UB, L IA, L UA and N UD. The first letter describing the position of the engine, and the last two letters describing areas of use. In marketing of the 4-series, Scania have generally only used the engine position (F/K/L/N), the engine displacement (9/11/12) and the series number (4), which is why we know them as F94, F114, K94, K114, K124, L94 and N94.|$|E
50|$|The {{maximum number}} of seat rows can be {{identified}} by the type designation. In the first Setra series, the number of seats was alone. In the second series (series 100), a 0 or 5 was affiixed, one of the numbers preceded {{in each of the}} following series (series 200, 300 and 400). Example: S 8 (= 8 seat rows), S 140 (= 14 seat rows), S 215 (= 15 seat rows), S 417 (= 17 seat rows) or S 319 UL (= 19 seat rows). The seats are reduced by comforter buildings or a certain star classification; The type designation is retained. Starting from the series 200, additions after the number indicated the equipment: current (series 400/500) are H for high-floor construction (no wheel arches in the passenger compartment), HD for high floor, HDH for extra-high floor, DT for double-deck touring bus, MD for mid-height floor (a spinoff of the GT series), UL for interurban commuter buses and NF for low-floor buses. In the past, the Grand Tourisme (GT), HDS for double-deck, SL for city buses and NR (low-floor Rational) were used for the first highway low-floor (200 series). Only a few types were given different designations, for example the S 250 Special (a modified S 215 HD which was also offered as an entry-level model after the introduction of the 300 series) and the S 300 NC (a former <b>low-floor</b> <b>city</b> <b>bus</b> as a predecessor of the Mercedes-Benz Citaro).|$|E
