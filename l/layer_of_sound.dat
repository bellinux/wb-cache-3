2500|$|Scenes {{shot at the}} United Palace theater {{created new}} {{challenges}} for the series' stunt team due to {{not being able to}} drill holes in the historic building for creating anchors for wire rigs and other complex stunts. The crew had to find other ways to weigh down the equipment to remain safe for the actors and stunt doubles. For the explosion at the restaurant [...] "Genghis Connie's", a practical explosion was created in the storefront on location, which was extended with visual effects to show the destruction of the building. A set showing the inside of the rubble of the destroyed building was then created on a soundstage, while a lot was found that [...] "feels" [...] similar to the original location, where rubble could by piled and fire trucks could be brought to show the exterior. The lot was previously being used to store vehicles that had been seized as evidence, with the production having to negotiate with the NYPD to have the vehicles moved elsewhere. Looking back on the filming style of the season, and comparing it to the previous Marvel Netflix series, Weeks said,"You want it to feel like it's all in the same city, all in the same time frame, but you want each show, each character to feel a little different. Have its own visual identity. Some of that is lighting, and of course, some of that is production design and location work ... We embraced Harlem for exactly what it is. The color, the life, the activity on the streets. There's so much character to the neighborhood… I think it was important to feel that these characters were rooted in the real place". The series' production sound mixer Joshua Anderson, who worked on Daredevil and Jessica Jones as well, worked to capture as much sound on set with boom mics over lavaliers to ground the unbelievable elements of the series in [...] "naturalistic sound". He noted that Ali's Cottonmouth laugh and many of Colter's lines in particular sounded [...] "incredible on the boom". Anderson also talked about Luke Cage adding a new <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> that the other series did not—music. The captured sound had to be clear to be properly mixed in with music later, and live performances in Harlem's Paradise had to be recorded for which Anderson and his team had experience after working on the musical series Smash.|$|E

The bulb is then sliced cleanly from top to bottom several times, creating 8 or 16 segments, {{depending on the size of}} the bulb. At this stage the segments are called [...] "chips" [...] (many growers are content with simply chipping a bulb into 4 or 8 and do not divide the bulb further).|$|E

The May/June 2011 American Record Guide wrote of it: [...] "Peter Gilbert's program {{is filled with}} the ghosts of sounds. He captures a dark, yet hopeful wonder through variation in color, mood, and the semblance of melodies. ...Everything here has the same kind of atmospheric, chromatic language with an absence of extreme dissonance. Resolutions are continually hidden just below the top <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound,</b> and slow shifts in color are constantly changing the soundscape gradually."He has works on the following CDs: ...|$|E
50|$|From early onwards Peschko {{developed}} {{the status of}} the lieder-pianist from one of a mere subordinate/supporter to that of an equal partner of the singers. He didn't simply provide a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> but rather built and created the foundation for each lied. His big, strong hands were those of a sculptor in which the keys turned into building material. Out of this sound material the lied was created, every one different according to situation, density and cadence of sounds and words. Artistically Peschko was a genuine person of the quiet sounds, and of seemingly fragile, yet insistent and durable creation, a maestro of the finest nuances.|$|E

A bricoluer uses simple tools for many tasks. This thesis considers how a contemporary bricoleur might {{step away from the}} workshop and into the everyday, taking only a broom as a familiar tool. “Conversations with strangers” performs the bricoleur at five sites, where the broom is a device that collects fragments of memories from conversations recorded there. These conversations form an inventory or collection that is a palimpsest merging human dialogue with a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> from the sites as the broom sweeps. Together with the broom, these fragments are repurposed within a sculptural installation and post-studio performance of the Bricoleur...|$|E
40|$|A {{fluorescent}} dye {{was applied to}} extracted premolars with either early artificial lesions or natural white-spot lesions. The teeth were placed in an approximal geometry, and with a specially designed fibre-optic probe the fluorescence of the dye was measured in the lesions. The same fibre-optic probe {{was used to measure}} the transmission of light at a wavelength where the dye does not absorb. This transmission of light was used to correct the fluorescence for attenuation by the intermediate <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> enamel situated between the probe and the lesion. Both signals varied with time because of the necessary addition of ethanol during the measurement. The mineral loss from the lesions was measured with wavelength independent microradiography (WIM) for the artificial lesions, and the optical caries monitor (OCM) for the natural white-spot lesions. The correlation coefficient between corrected fluorescence and mineral loss was r = 0. 86. The results indicate that measurement of dye uptake may be a very sensitive method to diagnose early approximal caries lesions and may enable quantification of these lesions...|$|E
40|$|Computer {{music is}} not the artistic {{expression}} of an exclusive set of composers that it used to be. Musicians and composers have grown to expect much more from electronics and computers than their ability to create &quot;out-of-this-world &quot; sounds for a tape piece. Silicon has already made its way on stage, in real-time musical environments, and computer music has evolved from being an abstract <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> to a substitute for real instruments and musicians. Within the past three decades, an eclectic set of tools for sound analysis and synthesis has been developed without ever leading to a general scheme which would highlight the issues, the difficulties and the justifications associated with a specific approach. A rush {{in the direction of}} incremental improvement of existing techniques has traditionally distinguished analysis and synthesis. Rather than confining ourselves to one of these arbitrarily exclusive tasks, we are pursuing an ambitious dream from a radically new perspective. The ultimate goal of this research is to infer virtual instruments from the observation of a real instrument without any strong pre-conception about the model's architecture. Ideally, the original observation should be a simple audio recording. We also want our inferred virtual instruments to exhibit physically realistic behaviors. Finally, we want the nature of the virtual instrument'...|$|E

40|$|The {{fluorescence}} {{intensity of}} the dye Fluorol(R) 7 GA in in vitro caries lesions was measured through a strip of plastic either 2 or 1. 5 mm in thickness. The light scattering in the plastic strips was comparable with light scattering in sound enamel. This method was chosen {{as a model for}} fluorescent dye measurement at approximal sites, where the fibreoptic probe cannot be placed directly on the lesion, so that measurements have to be made through a thin <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> enamel. It appeared that the fluorescent dye can be measured through a layer of scattering material and that a linear correlation exists between fluorescence intensity and calcium loss as measured by longitudinal microradiography. The correlation coefficient for the 2 -mm plastic strip was r = 0. 76. With the 1. 5 -mm plastic strip the fluorescence intensity recordings were about twice as high, and the correlation coefficient was r = 0. 81. From these measurements a proposal for an application procedure emerged for the use in a clinical situation. Also the transmission of light at 550 and 650 nm, at which wavelengths the fluorescent dye does not absorb, through plastic strips of varying thickness was measured. It is shown that by measurement of transmission of a non-adsorbing wavelength, the fluorescence intensity measured through a layer of scattering material can be corrected for this layer...|$|E
40|$|This {{media art}} {{installation}} aims to digitally reconstruct a traditional Chinese Guqin string instrument using physical sensing techniques, to invite bodily {{interpretation of the}} classical instrument. Guqin has a unique place in the Chinese history, {{as a symbol of}} the high culture of the nobles and intellectuals (Junzi, Superior Man). It's also seen as the vessel for pursuing harmony. Guqin is sometimes referred to by the Chinese as 2 ̆ 2 the father of Chinese music 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 the instrument of the sages 2 ̆ 2. This work allows the performer and audience to experience three dimensions of the Chinese culture: sound, movement and emotion. The setup consists of an interactive instrument with 2 ̆ 2 strings 2 ̆ 2 created by laser light, designed to allow meaningful intervention of movements to trigger the sound. The movements of the dancer is analysed using a Kinect camera in the EON Interact software. The performer will also wear bend and pressure sensors at different parts of the body to create <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> effects. The emotion of the performer will be sensed by a heartbeat sensor, which in turn translates into the temperature actuation (heating and cooling) at the palm rest of the audience, so that they could feel the additional sensation of the performance...|$|E
