[...] Brockington continued to express his distaste, writing [...] "Now I have to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> overproduced vocals by a pack of hyenas and their booty-slap noises." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s chance brought Takemitsu {{international}} attention: his Requiem for string orchestra (1957 [...] ), written as {{an homage to}} Hayasaka, was heard by Igor Stravinsky in 1958 {{during his visit to}} Japan. (The NHK had organised opportunities for Stravinsky to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> of the latest Japanese music; when Takemitsu's work was put on by mistake, Stravinsky insisted on hearing it to the end.) At a press conference later, Stravinsky expressed his admiration for the work, praising its [...] "sincerity" [...] and [...] "passionate" [...] writing. Stravinsky subsequently invited Takemitsu to lunch; and for Takemitsu this was an [...] "unforgettable" [...] experience. After Stravinsky returned to the U.S., Takemitsu soon received a commission for a new work from the Koussevitsky Foundation which, he assumed, had come as a suggestion from Stravinsky to Aaron Copland. For this he composed Dorian Horizon, (1966), which was premièred by the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Copland.|$|E
500|$|... "Suede and America fuelled {{my desire}} to prove to {{everyone}} that Blur were worth it", Albarn told Mojo in 2000, [...] "There was nothing more important in my life." [...] Albarn felt the popularity American grunge music was enjoying in Britain at the time would soon run out of steam, and argued that Blur would embody a renaissance of classic British pop on their next album. Although the singer felt Blur had finally found their musical identity, not everybody was convinced with Albarn's new British-centric manifesto. Food Records owner David Balfe, in particular, strongly disagreed, and got into fierce arguments with Albarn over the proposed change in Blur's image. After the still-sceptical Balfe finally relented, Food warily gave Blur the go-ahead {{to work on their}} second album with Albarn's first choice of producer, Andy Partridge of XTC. Blur and Partridge began work at The Church, a studio in Crouch End owned by keyboardist Dave Stewart. However, the pairing didn't work out. Bassist Alex James described the sessions as a [...] "disaster"; he added that [...] "as it was all being put together, they were all good parts, but it just wasn't ... sexy". Partridge said in 1999 of the sessions: [...] "I felt quite fatherly and I thought I did sterling work. They got Dave ‘Twat’ Balfe really stoned to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> mixes and he was rolling around going, ‘This is fantastic, you're George Martin and they're The Beatles.’ Next day he'd say, ‘Quite frankly, Andy, this is shit.’" [...] The band successfully recorded four songs, but they were wary about working in the same conditions again.|$|E

2500|$|College {{enrollment}} reached 9 {{million by}} the end of the 1960s. Colleges and universities in America had more students than ever before, and these institutions often tried to restrict student behavior to maintain order on the campuses. To combat this, many college students became active in causes that promoted free speech, student input in the curriculum, and an end to archaic social restrictions. Students joined the antiwar movement because they did not want to fight in a foreign civil war that they believed did not concern them or because they were morally opposed to all war. Others disliked the war because it diverted funds and attention away from problems in the U.S. Intellectual growth and gaining a liberal perspective at college caused many students to become active in the antiwar movement. Another attractive feature of the opposition movement was the fact that it was a popular social event. As one student said, antiwar demonstrations were the places to [...] "get laid, get high, and <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> great rock." ...|$|E

Relapse was the first album and first recordings that I did when the lights went on and I was sober. I {{was still trying to}} figure things out...It's interesting. Fun time. I had a fun time." [...] and reiterated his feeling about the album [...] "I felt Relapse was, I don't know. I don't know if people know what I really had to go through {{to be able to make}} Relapse and to be able to write again and to be able to think again and just normal everyday bodily functions and functions in my mind. I don't want to say I wasn't in a place to record again, but I needed time. I needed time to be able to figure out things. I wanted to be able to make my songs feel like something again. I know a lot of stuff on Relapse was comical and funny punchline jokes, but a lot of the songs didn't really feel like anything. I had to go back and <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> of my older music to try to figure out what I was doing wrong. Once I felt like I figured that out, I started making songs that felt like something again." ...|$|E
