The estimation techniques were applied to empirical data drawn from the South African economy. The Monte Carlo studies are unique in that data was statistically generated for the experiments. This approach was due to the fact that actual observations on economic variables contain several econometric problems, such as autocorrelation and MUlticollinearity, simultaneously. However, the approach in this study differs in that empirical data is used to evaluate the estimation techniques. The estimation techniques evaluated are : • Ordinary <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> <b>method</b> • Two stage <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> <b>method</b> • Limited information maximum likelihood method • Three stage <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> <b>method</b> • Full information maximum likelihood method. The estimates of the different coefficients are evaluated on the following criteria : • The bias of the estimates • The variance of the estimates • t-values of the estimates • The root mean square error. The ranking of the estimation techniques on the bias criterion is as follows : 1 Full information maximum likelihood <b>method.</b> 2 Ordinary <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> <b>method</b> 3 Three stage <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> <b>method</b> 4 Two stage <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> <b>method</b> 5 Limited information maximum likelihood method The ranking of the estimation techniques on the variance criterion is as follows : 1 Full information maximum likelihood <b>method.</b> 2 Ordinary <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> <b>method</b> 3 Three stage <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> <b>method</b> 4 Two stage <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> <b>method</b> 5 Limited information maximum. likelihood method All the estimation techniques performed poorly with regard to the statistical significance of the estimates. The ranking of the estimation techniques on the t-values of the estimates is thus as follows 1 Three stage <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> <b>method</b> 2 ordinary <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> <b>method</b> 3 Two stage <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> <b>method</b> and the limited information maximum likelihood method 4 Full information maximum likelihood method. The ranking of the estimation techniques on the root mean square error criterion is as follows : 1 Full information maximum likelihood method and the ordinary <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> <b>method</b> 2 Two stage <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> <b>method</b> 3 Limited information maximum likelihood method and the three stage <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> <b>method</b> The results achieved in this study are very similar to those of the Monte Carlo studies. The only exception is the ordinary <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> <b>method</b> that performed better on every criteria dealt with in this study.
