5|$|The {{military}} conspirators {{brought to}} power the 17-year-old King Peter II Karađorđević, whom they declared to be of age to assume the throne, and a {{government of national unity}} was formed with Simović as prime minister and Vladko Maček and Slobodan Jovanović as his vice-premiers. The coup <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|As noted above, Section 7(a) led to {{significant}} increases in union organizing, as intended by the Act. But the enforcement of Section 7(a) and its legal limitations led to clear failures. Although Section 7(a) was not affected by the Supreme Court's decision in Schechter v. Poultry, {{the failure of the}} section <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> passage of the National Labor Relations Act in July 1935.|$|E

5|$|Eighteenth century {{scientific}} laboratories usually contained {{some form}} of hand-operated electrostatic machine. Italian scientist Luigi Galvani had an electrostatic generator in his laboratory, where experiments with frog legs led {{to the discovery of}} animal electricity. Another Italian scientist, Alessandro Volta, disagreed with some of Galvani's ideas, and this scientific argument motivated Volta to develop the first frog-free galvanic cell, and <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> the invention of the first practical electric battery, the voltaic pile.|$|E
5|$|Gauguin {{was celebrated}} by the Parisian avant-garde after the posthumous {{retrospective}} exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne in 1903 and 1906. The power evoked by his work <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> Les Demoiselles d'Avignon in 1907. According to David Sweetman, Picasso became an aficionado of Gauguin in 1902 when he befriended the expatriate Spanish sculptor and ceramist Paco Durrio in Paris. Durrio {{was a friend}} of Gauguin and held several of his works in an attempt to help his poverty-stricken friend in Tahiti by promoting his oeuvre in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that same}} year, on May 4, the {{shooting}} of four students at Kent State protesting against the United States' invasion of Cambodia <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> the student strike of 1970, a nationwide protest by students on college campuses against US involvement in Vietnam, including at Syracuse. Early protests on campus led to firebombing and window-breaking, but Corbally's decision to cancel classes and allow the students to protest without police or administration interference arguably resulted in more moderate protests than at other colleges.|$|E
5000|$|From 1827 Cuninghame {{served as}} {{minister}} in a congregational church at Stewarton in Ayrshire.

But there we came upon a disappointment.|$|R
25|$|The {{foundation}} also undertook {{building and}} supervising mosques, schools, Islamic centers, scholarships {{for students in}} poor Muslim countries, organizing Shariah courses, distribution of Ramadan breakfasts and blankets in the winter. As part of its activities, the foundation also distributed food, clothes and medicine for victims of wars and natural calamities all over the world. The closure of the charity <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> the closure {{of a number of}} orphanages supported or run by foundation in Somalia.|$|R
5|$|Williams and Kilburn {{reported}} on the SSEM {{in a letter to}} the Journal Nature, published in September 1948. The machine's successful demonstration quickly led to the construction of a more practical computer, the , work on which began in August 1948. The first version was operational by April 1949, and it in turn <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> the development of the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available general-purpose computer.|$|E
5|$|Catering for {{visitors}} at Belle Vue {{was on an}} industrial scale, ranging from the late 19th century hot water rooms, which accommodated up to 3,000 diners each, providing crockery and hot water for those who brought their own picnics, to more upmarket themed restaurants. Belle Vue {{became a part of}} the caterer and hotelier Charles Forte's business empire towards the end of its life in the 1960s. Although he made some improvements to the zoo, Forte's interests lay in developing the gardens' dining and exhibition facilities. The Kings Hall was then the largest exhibition space outside London, but competition from the G-Mex exhibition and conference centre in central Manchester <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> its closure in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Dowding's {{insistence on}} waiting for AI <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> his {{dismissal}} on 24 November 1940. Many historians and writers, including Bowen, have suggested his dismissal was unwise, {{and that his}} identification of AI radar as the only practical solution was ultimately correct. While this may be true, the cat's eye force did result {{in a number of}} kills during the Blitz, although their effectiveness was limited and quickly overshadowed by the night fighter force. In May 1941 cat's eye fighters claimed 106 kills to the night fighters' 79, but flew twice as many sorties to do so.|$|E

5|$|Schmid {{coached the}} Los Angeles Galaxy and the Columbus Crew in MLS, before {{becoming}} {{the head coach}} of Seattle Sounders FC in 2009. Despite never having played soccer at a professional level, he has the most coaching wins in MLS history and was {{the recipient of the}} MLS Coach of the Year Award in 1999 and 2008. Throughout his career, Schmid has received praise from critics for his ability to identify new talent. His defensive tactics are also highly regarded in the press and often cited as a factor in his success. However, their deployment in his final two seasons with Los Angeles <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> the termination of his contract.|$|E
5|$|The splendid artistic {{legacy of}} Angkor Wat and other Khmer monuments in the Angkor region <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> France {{adopting}} Cambodia as a protectorate on 11 August 1863 and invading Siam {{to take control}} of the ruins. This quickly led to Cambodia reclaiming lands in the northwestern corner of the country that had been under Siamese (Thai) control since AD 1351 (Manich Jumsai 2001), or by some accounts, AD 1431. Cambodia gained independence from France on 9 November 1953 and has controlled Angkor Wat since that time. It is safe to say that from the colonial period onwards until the site's nomination as UNESCO World Heritage in 1992, this specific temple of Angkor Wat was instrumental in the formation of the modern and gradually globalised concept of built cultural heritage.|$|E
5|$|Historian Robert Poole {{has called}} the Peterloo Massacre one of the {{defining}} moments of its age. In its own time, the London and national papers shared the horror felt in the Manchester region, but Peterloo's immediate effect was to cause the government {{to crack down on}} reform, with the passing of {{what became known as the}} Six Acts. It also <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> the foundation of The Manchester Guardian (now The Guardian), but had little other effect on the pace of reform. In a survey conducted by The Guardian in 2006, Peterloo came second to the Putney Debates as the event from radical British history that most deserved a proper monument or a memorial. Peterloo is commemorated by a plaque close to the site, a replacement for an earlier one that was criticised as being inadequate as it did not reflect the scale of the massacre.|$|E
50|$|In 1960, Remington Bristow, an {{employee}} of the medical examiner's office who doggedly pursued the case until his death in 1993, contacted a New Jersey psychic, who told him to look for a house that matched the foster home. When the psychic was brought to the Philadelphia discovery site, she <b>led</b> Bristow <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> the foster home.|$|R
60|$|Primarily the {{struggle}} of the Texans for freedom did not form {{a part of our}} war with Mexico, yet this struggle <b>led</b> up <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> the greater war to follow, and it is probably a fact that, had the people of Texas not at first accomplished their freedom, {{there would have been no}} war between the two larger republics.|$|R
40|$|On his way {{to general}} relativity, Einstein used the {{equivalence}} principle to formulate a theory of the static gravitational field. In this context he introduced an approximate coordinate transformation to an accelerated frame {{which turns out to}} be closely related to Rindler coordinates, widely used in modern general relativity. This work, published in the Annalen, <b>led</b> him <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> interpret gravitation in terms of spacetime curvature...|$|R
5|$|In September 1943, word reached Bohr and {{his brother}} Harald that the Nazis {{considered}} their family to be Jewish, since their mother was Jewish, {{and that they were}} therefore in danger of being arrested. The Danish resistance helped Bohr and his wife escape by sea to Sweden on 29 September. The next day, Bohr persuaded King Gustaf V of Sweden to make public Sweden's willingness to provide asylum to Jewish refugees. On 2 October 1943, Swedish radio broadcast that Sweden was ready to offer asylum, and the mass rescue of the Danish Jews by their countrymen followed swiftly thereafter. Some historians claim that Bohr's actions <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> the mass rescue, while others say that, though Bohr did all that he could for his countrymen, his actions were not a decisive influence on the wider events. Eventually, over 7,000 Danish Jews escaped to Sweden.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Peloponnesian War, the militaristic city-state of Sparta had been able to impose a hegemony over the heartland of Classical Greece (the Peloponessus and mainland Greece south of Thessaly), the states of this area having been severely weakened by the war. This state of affairs was resented by many of the Greek city-states, which had traditionally been ferociously independent, and <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> the Corinthian War of 395–387 BC. Sparta emerged from this conflict with its hegemony intact, though only as a result of Persian intervention, which led to the so-called King's Peace. The fragility of Spartan dominance had been demonstrated however, and in the next decade, the Thebans would revolt against Sparta. The Spartans were unable to successfully quell the revolt, leading to de facto Theban independence. Then, after several years of desultory conflict, the Thebans finally met the Spartans in open battle at Leuctra (371 BC), and under the leadership of Epaminondas inflicted an unprecedented defeat on the Spartan army, killing the Spartan king Cleombrotus I in the process.|$|E
5|$|Now one of Edward's strongest supporters, he {{accompanied}} the king {{on a campaign}} to Scotland in 1314, when several other nobles refused. He was killed at the Battle of Bannockburn on 24June, under somewhat unclear circumstances. Gloucester was {{the most prominent of}} the casualties of the battle, which ended in a humiliating defeat for England. As he had no issue, his death marked the end of the prominent de Clare family. His estates were divided between his three sisters, one of whom was married to the king's new favourite, Hugh Despenser the Younger. Despenser's ruthless expansion of the de Clare lordship of Glamorgan in Wales <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> the troubles of EdwardII's later reign, including a rebellion in the Welsh Marches, the defeat of the Earl of Lancaster at the Battle of Boroughbridge, and eventually the deposition of the king by Roger Mortimer and Queen Isabella in 1326.|$|E

5|$|The War of the American Independence saw {{a series}} of {{military}} manoeuvres and battles involving naval forces of the British Royal Navy and the Continental Navy from 1775, and of the French Navy from 1778 onwards. These culminated in the surrender of the British Army force of Lieutenant-General Earl Charles Cornwallis, an event that <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> the beginning of serious peace negotiations and the eventual end of the war. From {{the start of the}} hostilities, the British North American station under Vice-Admiral Samuel Graves blockaded the major colonial ports and carried raids agaynst patriot communities. Colonial forces could do little to stop these developments due to British naval supremacy. In 1777, colonial privateers made raids into British waters capturing merchant ships, which they took into French and Spanish ports, although both were officially neutral. Seeking to challenge Britain, France signed two treaties with America in February 1778, but stopped short of declaring war on Britain. The risk of a French invasion forced the British to concentrate its forces in the English Channel, leaving its forces in North America vulnerable to attacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne, {{and his wife}} Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, occurred on 28 June 1914 in Sarajevo when they were mortally wounded by Gavrilo Princip. Princip {{was one of a}} group of six assassins (five Serbs and one Bosniak) coordinated by Danilo Ilić, a Bosnian Serb and a member of the Black Hand secret society. The political objective of the assassination was to break off Austria-Hungary's South Slav provinces so they could be combined into a Yugoslavia. The assassins' motives were consistent with the movement that later became known as Young Bosnia. The assassination <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> the First World War when Austria-Hungary subsequently issued an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia, which was partially rejected. Austria-Hungary then declared war, triggering actions leading to war between most European states.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture and}} flight tests of Koga's Zero is usually {{described}} as a tremendous coup for the Allies as it revealed the secrets of that mysterious aircraft and <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> its downfall. According to this viewpoint, only then did Allied pilots learn {{how to deal with}} their nimble opponents. The Japanese could not agree more... Yet those naval pilots who fought the Zero at Coral Sea, Midway, and Guadalcanal without the benefit of test reports would beg to differ with the contention that it took dissection of Koga's Zero to create tactics that beat the fabled airplane. To them the Zero did not long remain a mystery plane. Word quickly circulated among the combat pilots as to its particular attributes. Indeed on 6 October while testing the Zero, Akutan Zero test pilot Frederick M. Trapnell made a highly revealing statement: 'The general impression of the airplane is exactly as originally created by intelligence—including the performance'.|$|E
