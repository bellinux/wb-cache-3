The destroyer was broken up at Rosyth in April 1958.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} have conical teeth, used {{to catch}} swift prey such as small river fish. They also have very long snouts, with some measuring , four times <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>most</b> of their oceanic counterparts. They have a two-chambered stomach {{that is similar}} in structure to that of terrestrial carnivores. They have fundic and pyloric chambers. Breathing involves expelling stale air from their blowhole, followed by inhaling fresh air into their lungs. They {{do not have the}} iconic spout, as this only forms when the warm air exhaled from the lungs meets cold external air, which does not occur in their tropical habitats.|$|E

At Smalls Paradise, patrons could also reserve {{a seat at the}} club by paying a yearly fee. Many regular visitors of Harlem's night clubs also found the food better at Smalls Paradise than at either The Cotton Club or Connie's Inn. While most of the night spots shut their doors between 3 and 4 am, Smalls Paradise began breakfast dances at 6 am with a floor show of up to 30 dancers and a full jazz band.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{scarcity}} of water, the Namib Desert Horse sometimes goes without water {{for as long}} as thirty hours in summer and has been known to go close to 72 hours without water during the winter, significantly <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>most</b> horses, even other feral herds. A 1991 study suggested that in 75 years of genetic isolation and water scarcity the population had developed physiological mechanisms which improved their ability to conserve water. In 1993, a second study showed that the physiological water-conservation ability did not differ between Namib Desert Horses and other populations when dehydrated for periods of up to 60 hours, but suggested that the Namib Desert Horse would show improved conservation ability when dehydration periods were extended to upwards of 72 hours, a common occurrence in their feral state.|$|E
5|$|In a {{small sample}} of 11 {{deceased}} dogs, Australian Cattle Dogs had a median longevity of 11.7years (maximum 15.9yrs). A larger survey of 100 deceased dogs yielded a mean longevity of 13.41years {{with a standard deviation of}} 2.36years. The median longevities of breeds of similar size are between 11 and 13years. There is an anecdotal report of a Cattle Dog named Bluey, born in 1910 and living for 29.5years, but the record is unverified. Even if true, Bluey's record age would have to be regarded more as an uncharacteristic exception than as an indicator of common exceptional longevity for the entire breed. It remains, however, that Australian Cattle Dogs generally age well and appear to live on average almost a year <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>most</b> dogs of other breeds in the same weight class. Many members of the breed are still well and active at 12 or 14years of age, and some maintain their sight, hearing and even their teeth until their final days.|$|E
5|$|This loss led Tiku to {{reinforce}} his men. The Torajan troops were armed with rifles, spears, boulders, swords, and chili pepper extract, sprayed into enemy {{eyes with a}} device called a tirik lada, or blowgun, to blind them. Tiku himself was armed with a Portuguese rifle, spear, and labo. He wore protective armour, a sepu (crotch guard), and a songkok with protrusions {{in the shape of}} buffalo horns, and carried a decorated shield. With his soldiers, Tiku dug pits filled with bamboo stakes along Dutch supply routes; those who wandered over the pits would fall in and be impaled. However, these were not enough to stop the advancing Dutch. On 17 October 1906, two more fortresses, Bamba Puang and Kotu, fell, after several unsuccessful Dutch attacks since June. As the campaign against Tiku, which had already lasted <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>most</b> other campaigns in the occupation, was thought to undermine Dutch authority in Sulawesi, Governor-General J. B. van Heutsz dispatched Governor of Sulawesi Swart to personally lead the attack.|$|E

Canoeing {{used to be a}}llowed on about twelve weekends per year, {{and tens of thousands of}} canoeists descended on Llangollen for recreational paddling (several Dee tours were held every winter), slalom competitions, and wild water races.|$|E
25|$|The {{worldwide}} Great Depression of 1929 and {{the early}} 1930s had crippling effects on the Dutch economy, lasting longer than in most other European countries. The long duration of the Great Depression in the Netherlands is often explained by the very strict fiscal policy of the Dutch government at the time, and its decision {{to adhere to the}} gold standard for much <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>most</b> of its trading partners. The depression led to high unemployment and widespread poverty, as well as increasing social unrest.|$|E

Carías had taken command of the government forces, obtained arms from El Salvador, and crushed the uprising in short order. Most of Carías's first term in office was devoted to efforts to avoid financial collapse, improve the military, engage in a limited program of road building, and lay the foundations for prolonging his own hold on power.|$|E
25|$|Ion {{mobility}} spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS/MS or IMMS) is {{a technique}} where ions are first separated by drift time through some neutral gas under an applied electrical potential gradient before being introduced into a mass spectrometer. Drift time {{is a measure of}} the radius relative to the charge of the ion. The duty cycle of IMS (the time over which the experiment takes place) is <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>most</b> mass spectrometric techniques, such that the mass spectrometer can sample along the course of the IMS separation. This produces data about the IMS separation and the mass-to-charge ratio of the ions in a manner similar to LC/MS.|$|E

It had multiple elongated phalanges, making the flippers much <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> in <b>most</b> other nothosaurs, and more closely resembling those of the later plesiosaurs. Ceresiosaurus also had the shortest skull of any known nothosaur, which further increased its resemblance to plesiosaurs.|$|R
25|$|Dean {{was criticized}} during his 2004 presidential {{campaign}} for another decision related to civil unions. Shortly before leaving office, {{he had some}} of his Vermont papers sealed {{for at least the}} next decade, a time frame <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>most</b> outgoing governors use, stating that he was protecting the privacy of many gay supporters who sent him personal letters about the issue. On the campaign trail, he demanded that Vice President Dick Cheney release his energy committee papers. Many people, including Democratic Senator and failed 2004 presidential candidate Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, who left the party after losing his primary for re-election in 2006, accused Dean of hypocrisy. Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit to force the papers be opened before the seal expired, but lost.|$|E
25|$|Trans fats {{are used}} in {{shortenings}} for deep-frying in restaurants, {{as they can be}} used for <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>most</b> conventional oils before becoming rancid. In the early 21st century, non-hydrogenated vegetable oils that have lifespans exceeding that of the frying shortenings became available. As fast-food chains routinely use different fats in different locations, trans fat levels in fast food can have large variations. For example, an analysis of samples of McDonald's French fries collected in 2004 and 2005 found that fries served in New York City contained twice as much trans fat as in Hungary, and 28 times as much as in Denmark, where trans fats are restricted. At KFC, the pattern was reversed, with Hungary's product containing twice the trans fat of the New York product. Even within the United States there was variation, with fries in New York containing 30% more trans fat than those from Atlanta.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{locomotives}} {{remained in}} traffic, both departmental and in regular stock. They lasted <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>most</b> classes of pre-grouping tank engine under the Southern Railway, {{primarily due to}} the presence of several light railways which came under the Southern Railway's jurisdiction at the grouping, such as the lines from Tenterden and Hayling Island, {{as well as on the}} Isle of Wight. Most of these lines needed small engines such as the 'Terrier' class due to severe weight restrictions. Among the engines transferred into departmental use was the former No.82 Boxhill, which was restored to original condition, painted in the yellow ochre livery of Stroudley and used as a shunter at Brighton Works, being numbered 380S and named after the works itself. This engine was replaced by 377S, formerly No.35 Morden, in 1948. Although much photographed toward the end of steam, this locomotive was not preserved but was scrapped at Eastleigh in 1963.|$|E
