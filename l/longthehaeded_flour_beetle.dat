50|$|The {{confused}} <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> is {{very similar}} in appearance and habit to the red <b>flour</b> <b>beetle,</b> Tribolium castaneum and the destructive <b>flour</b> <b>beetle,</b> Tribolium destructor. Both the confused <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> and red <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> are small, about 3-6 mm (1/8-1/4 inch) in length, and reddish-brown in color. The primary distinguishing physical difference is the shape of their antennae: the confused <b>flour</b> <b>beetle's</b> antennae increase gradually in size and have four clubs, while the red <b>flour</b> <b>beetle's</b> antennae have only three. Additionally, red <b>flour</b> <b>beetles</b> {{have been known to}} fly short distances, while confused <b>flour</b> <b>beetles</b> do not. Tribolium destructor is much darker than either and less common.|$|R

50|$|The {{destructive}} or dark <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> (Tribolium destructor), one of {{the species}} of darkling beetle known generally as <b>flour</b> <b>beetles,</b> is a common pest insect known for attacking and infesting stored flour and grain.|$|R
50|$|Female red <b>flour</b> <b>beetles</b> are {{polyandrous}} in mating behavior. Within {{a single}} copulation period, a single female will mate with multiple different males. Female red <b>flour</b> <b>beetles</b> engage in polyandrous mating behavior {{in order to}} increase their fertility assurance. By mating with an increased number of males, female beetles obtain a greater amount of sperm. Obtaining a greater amount of sperm is especially important since many sexually active male red <b>flour</b> <b>beetles</b> are non-virgins and may be sperm-depleted. It {{is important to note that}} red <b>flour</b> <b>beetles</b> engage in polyandry to obtain a greater amount of sperm from males, not to increase the likelihood of finding genetically compatible sperm.|$|R
50|$|Two {{different}} types of beetles are classified as flour beetles: the red <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> and the confused <b>flour</b> <b>beetle.</b> Both are similar in physical characteristics. They are flat and oval in shape and usually range around 1/8 inch long. Their exoskeletons are reddish brown with a shiny and smooth texture. The eggs, larvae, and pupae resemble each other closely in physical features, as well. The eggs usually {{tend to be a}} white color, or at times even colorless. They are very small in size and have a sticky outer covering that causes certain food particles to stick to them. The larvae have six legs, with two pointy projections toward the caudal end. Finally, the pupal stage (a cocoon-like form) is usually a white or brownish color. The beetle life cycle lasts about three years or more, with the larval stage ranging anywhere from 20 to over 100 days, and the pupal stage around eight days. Beetles usually breed in damaged grain, grain dust, high-moisture wheat kernels and flour. The female <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> can lay between 300 and 400 eggs during her lifetime period of 5 to 8 months. The <b>flour</b> <b>beetles</b> mainly infest grains, including, but not limited to: cereal, corn meal oats, rice, flour, and crackers. This type of beetle is the most abundant insect pest of flour mills across the United States. Their small size allows them to maneuver through cracks and crevices and get into the home and other areas. Once they are present in areas with potential food sources, they can infest material such as flour, resulting in a sharp odor or moldy flavor. The red <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> is able to fly short distances and the confused <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> is unable to fly. While the confused <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> is more commonly found in the northern United States, the red <b>flour</b> <b>beetles</b> are more predominant in the southern United States in areas with warmer climates.The red <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> and the confused <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> are commonly used as a model organisms, to study genetics and ecology. The genome of the red <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> has been sequenced.|$|R

40|$|Red <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> (Tribolium castaneum) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common insect pests infesting wheat flour mills (Toews et al. 2006). Structural {{treatments}} such as methyl bromide, sulfuryl fluoride and heat, are used to control the red <b>flour</b> <b>beetle.</b> The structural treatments do not provide any residual action and thus, any surviving insect stages can rebound rapidly depending on the temperature. In addition, the distribution of the fumigant or heat-treatment in the facility can result in different mortality rates for different floors or regions of the mill. Simulation models can be used to develop optimal integrated pest management strategies (Thorpe et al., 1982; Longstaff, 1988; Hagstrum and Throne, 1989; Flinn et al., 1997). Models developed for the <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> in stored grain have been useful for predicting population trends (Hagstrum and Flinn, 1990). Our objective was to develop a model for the red <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> in wheat <b>flour</b> mills that could be used to predict the effects of various structural treatments and subsequent population rebound. Currently, heat-treatment is not included in the model- it will be added in a future version.

50|$|During mating, red <b>flour</b> <b>beetles</b> {{are known}} to engage in {{polygamous}} behavior. Male <b>flour</b> <b>beetles</b> {{have been known to}} recognize their relatives while the females do not have this capability. Lack of the ability to recognize their relatives has led females to mate with any male within the population. Female red <b>flour</b> <b>beetles</b> are also known to store sperm after mating. More sperm is stored by the first mating, which leads to less sperm stored in subsequent matings. However, amount of stored sperm does not stop the last male mate from fertilizing the egg. This {{is due to the fact}} that with each mating, males can remove previously stored sperm thus giving their own sperm an advantage to fertilize the egg.|$|R

40|$|Dried Distillers Grains with Solubles (DDGS) {{is used in}} {{livestock}} feeds {{and finishing}} diets to replace maize or other grains. As more of this product is available to the feed industry, the effect it might have on the vulnerability of animal feed to insect infestation is unknown. This research focused {{on the influence of}} old generation DDGS as food and oviposition resource of red <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> Tribolium castaneum in contrast with a traditional a flour (90 %) /yeast (10 %) diet. Larval development was significantly faster (P< 0. 05) on a flour/yeast diet (19. 15 ± 0. 16 d) compared to the DDGS (45. 44 ± 0. 72 d). Both DDGS and the flour/yeast diet had no significant influence on egg hatch or pupation time. These results indicate that this type of DDGS is not as suitable a developmental diet compared to the standard laboratory diet and that the addition of DDGS to animal feeds should not increase feed vulnerability to <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> infestation. Additionally, in a no-choice situation, oviposition rate was significantly lower (P< 0. 05) on DDGS compared to the flour/yeast diet.
