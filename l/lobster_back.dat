6000|$|... "I {{have kept}} the lads out of sight lest some meddling <b>lobster</b> <b>back</b> should report a {{dangerous}} gathering. Every fellow is present, and eager {{to hear what you}} learned at Cambridge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am yet bewildered," [...] Silas replied {{as if in}} a maze. [...] "Hiram {{had with}} him a <b>lobster</b> <b>back,</b> who walked with us to the corner of the lane, and {{therefore}} we had no opportunity for conversation." ...|$|E
60|$|Then it was I {{began to}} cast about for some plan which would promise {{at least a}} shadow of success, and I had ample time before me for such effort, unless, perchance, some {{inquisitive}} <b>lobster</b> <b>back</b> or marine came upon our hiding place.|$|E
6000|$|Hiram speedily {{put an end}} to {{any such}} hope, saying to one man who had {{declared}} that the <b>lobster</b> <b>backs</b> would not come upon us again: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because in {{the first}} place, {{so far as the}} <b>lobster</b> <b>backs</b> know, I haven't been mixed up in the doings of the Minute Boys as have the rest of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope I {{may never}} run the same risk among the <b>lobster</b> <b>backs</b> again. It was too tight a squeeze to suit me," [...] Hiram replied grimly, and added, [...] "Are the gentlemen in?" ...|$|R
60|$|Now up to {{this time}} we had been so {{fortunate}} as not to have {{come in contact with}} the patrol or any straggling <b>lobster</b> <b>back,</b> {{and it would have been}} possible, had we gone directly there, for us to have gained the ship-yard unobserved.|$|E
6000|$|... "My own {{two hands}} will be enough, {{so far as}} I am concerned. If we stumble upon a single <b>lobster</b> <b>back</b> other weapons will not be needed. In the event of meeting a squad, it would be folly to make any show of resistance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{what have}} they marked you for?" [...] Silas asked with a laugh. [...] "Are you counted {{on being able to}} act the part of a half-way decent scarecrow, or are you ranked as a lickspittle to some <b>lobster</b> <b>back</b> who hasn't yet learned to speak English?" ...|$|E
60|$|If {{the battle}} of Lexington was {{a victory for the}} <b>lobster</b> <b>backs,</b> then of a verity when the king's men had won a dozen of a similar kind, we of the colony were come off conquerors.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, what then?" [...] I demanded impatiently. [...] "Once he {{has made}} the {{discovery}} that I am outside, can you prevent him raising an alarm, and thus bringing the <b>lobster</b> <b>backs</b> upon those who are inside?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Give me half a show to do aught toward thwarting the <b>lobster</b> <b>backs,</b> and I'll {{stay with}} you till the crack of doom, if so be I live that long and the job is not {{finished}} before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, {{we can go}} out of Boston a {{dozen times}} over, 'twixt now and sunrise, without any <b>lobster</b> <b>back</b> being the wiser," [...] I cried, {{determined}} if there was aught {{to be done in}} behalf of the Cause that night, I would have a hand in it.|$|E
60|$|Then it {{was that}} I steered a course for the water mill, and thence kept on along {{the shore of the}} mill pond, where was less danger of coming in contact with a <b>lobster</b> <b>back,</b> and after that the way was, as you might say, plain sailing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, else {{why should}} I spend my breath in recounting the plan," [...] Silas cried impatiently. [...] "Are {{you of the}} mind to join us, or is it more to your liking to follow Amos Nelson and act as lickspittle to any <b>lobster</b> <b>back</b> you chance to come upon?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is plain}} Seth Jepson has played the traitor, by {{going after the}} <b>lobster</b> <b>backs</b> to take us into custody while we remain here. There {{is no time to}} be lost; we must embark on the instant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The skiffs {{belonging}} to our friends are hidden, for by General Gage's orders all craft {{that could be}} found have been taken possession of by the <b>lobster</b> <b>backs.</b> We might search a full day without coming upon any." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was in {{your mind}} that some of the <b>lobster</b> <b>backs</b> might be drawn off while General Gage is pushing his {{outposts}} on the Neck. How can you say that such may not have been done this very morning?" ...|$|R
60|$|We {{were not}} delayed {{in the short}} journey, however, because of my {{familiarity}} with the gardens and byways on the route, which admitted of our making fair progress while shunning the streets, and he who could have pounced upon us would indeed have been a quicker-witted <b>lobster</b> <b>back</b> than I have yet seen.|$|E
60|$|Because he gave {{no warning}} {{that we should}} remain silent, were my suspicions {{regarding}} his loyalty increased, for if peradventure our presence there must be kept a profound secret from everybody, then should he have checked Hiram, since in event of a Tory or a <b>lobster</b> <b>back</b> entering the building, our comrade's voice would be heard.|$|E
6000|$|We {{left the}} house which had been our prison, in haste, as if already the pursuers were at our heels, and when we stepped into the open air I {{recalled}} that which Hiram had said regarding the <b>lobster</b> <b>back</b> who was to aid us in embarking, therefore whispered to our leader as we went at a swift pace {{in the direction of}} the ship-yard: ...|$|E
6000|$|Half a {{dozen of}} the lads cheered wildly, after which they again devoted their {{attention}} to the human targets, while Hiram cried as he swung the tiller down, willing now to give the <b>lobster</b> <b>backs</b> a chance to run away: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forty men are {{stationed}} there, twenty {{being kept}} on duty all the time, {{and unless you}} can find one of the <b>lobster</b> <b>backs</b> who would lend his aid, there is no possibility of your doing that for which you came." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{had nothing}} of {{importance}} to report, and I left him in Dock square loitering about {{in the hope of}} overhearing some conversation among the <b>lobster</b> <b>backs</b> which would interest our friends at Cambridge, as I went boldly through Queen street.|$|R
60|$|It so chanced that I was in {{the upper}} room trying to gain {{some idea of the}} time, when there came two sharp raps on the shutter through which I was peering, and so nervous had I become that I cried aloud in fear, darting back to the trap-door, {{positive}} that none other than a <b>lobster</b> <b>back</b> or a Tory could be thus striving to attract our attention.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, after {{considerable}} humming and hawing; but I'm of {{the belief}} that if the <b>lobster</b> <b>back</b> hadn't been with me {{it would have been}} a different matter. The lieutenant couldn't fail of being impressed by the fact that I had come with one of his own kidney as escort, and from this out I shall have a kindly feeling for a red coat, even though I fail to love the one that wears it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We can't {{take the}} chances of two, as matters stand now, and Job Lord is the more {{valuable}} to our friends in Cambridge," [...] Hiram said, speaking hurriedly {{as he began to}} cast off the bonds from the man's feet. [...] "The <b>lobster</b> <b>back</b> who went with me to the Bridewell knows I was given but one, and he is to aid us in embarking, therefore to have two would cause a suspicion to enter even his thick head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It will {{be better}} she is taken by the <b>lobster</b> <b>backs</b> empty, than with us in her," [...] Hiram said grimly when we drew her up on land, and it can well be fancied that I was of the same opinion.|$|R
60|$|Because of what {{happened}} shortly afterward, I believe the Tory cur had heard at home some inkling {{of what was to}} be done by the <b>lobster</b> <b>backs,</b> for never had I seen him so bold, who was ever somewhat of a coward.|$|R
60|$|At {{that instant}} Archie {{was seized by}} the collar from behind, and I was near to letting out a cry of fear, for I counted as a {{certainty}} that some <b>lobster</b> <b>backs,</b> having overheard our words, were come to lend the Tory lad a hand.|$|R
60|$|He had {{prepared}} himself for this hazardous venture by procuring such {{an amount of}} rations as might serve one person two or three days. As for weapons, he had none, and when I asked him whether {{he did not believe}} it wise to make some provision for meeting an enemy suddenly, he replied that when he came upon a <b>lobster</b> <b>back</b> unawares it would be at such time and in such place as would shut off all chance of using firearms.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, lad, {{it strikes}} me the danger is very much less, because I count on going there with a <b>lobster</b> <b>back</b> as guard and assistant. The officer on duty at the Bridewell will never stop to ask who sent the soldier with me; but seeing the governor's order, will, unless he is a rank idiot, {{conclude}} that General Gage himself showed me such delicate attention, and I'm counting that by having a red-coated escort I've wiped out {{more than half the}} chances that the order will be questioned." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{fail to see}} {{any reason}} why you should in every case act as {{messenger}} 'twixt here and Cambridge. Send some other of your company. It is true we lost the boat in which you and I came, because of having left her where any blundering <b>lobster</b> <b>back</b> might stumble upon the craft; but you said this morning {{that it would be}} possible for us to get two small skiffs at any time." [...] Then he asked abruptly, [...] "How high from the street is the window of the room where your comrade is held prisoner?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Seth Jepson," [...] I replied, {{and then}} I {{told him of}} our having {{enrolled}} that young Tory among the Minute Boys, {{as well as the}} reason we had for suspecting him before he openly played the traitor by bringing the <b>lobster</b> <b>backs</b> to Barton's point.|$|R
60|$|Lying {{upon the}} wet mud and seaweed, for {{the tide was}} luckily at about half-ebb, I strove desperately to regain my breath and my {{strength}} so that I might have both at command if by some chance the <b>lobster</b> <b>backs</b> got an inkling of my whereabouts.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have the}} long tramp before me even now," [...] I {{said in a}} tone of dismay to my father, who had {{accompanied}} me to the river. [...] "With a craft like that I would have no hope of escape if peradventure the <b>lobster</b> <b>backs</b> gave chase." ...|$|R
