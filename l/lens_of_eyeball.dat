40|$|AIM:To {{evaluate}} the effect {{and safety of}} phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation combined with trabeculectomy for primary angle-closured glaucoma with cataract. METHODS: Retrospective study was performed in 49 cases(59 eyes) of primary angle-closure glaucoma with cataract patients treated with phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation combined with trabeculectomy. Among them, 35 eyes were acute primary angle-closure glaucoma(APACG), 24 eyes were chronic primary angle-closure glaucoma(CPACG). Visual acuity, intraocular pressure(IOP), thickness <b>of</b> <b>lens,</b> axial length <b>of</b> <b>eyeball,</b> central anterior chamber depth, complications and medications were detected in all patients followed up until 6 - 12 months. RESULTS: 1) Preoperative and postoperative IOP were 23. 9 ± 6. 6 mmHg, 11. 7 ± 2. 6 mmHg respectively in APACG group(n = 35, P n = 24, P P P P P P CONCLUSION:Phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation combined with trabeculectomy is effective and safe treatment for primary angle-closure glaucoma with cataract patients, especially for acute primary angle-closure glaucoma compared with chronic primary angle-closure glaucoma...|$|R

5|$|Eye {{conditions}} which affect the Parson Russell Terrier include primary lens luxation, a heritable condition. This disease causes the zonular fibres to be abnormal {{and begin to}} disintegrate in affected dogs. The fibres support the <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> the eye, and their destruction can cause the lens {{to fall into the}} wrong location within the eye. If the lens falls into the anterior chamber <b>of</b> <b>eyeball</b> then a secondary glaucoma can occur, causing loss of vision. National kennel associations such as the Kennel Club (UK) publish DNA screening results on Parson Russell Terriers, broken down into three groups; clears, carriers, and affecteds.|$|R
30|$|The <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> {{the eye is}} a radiation-sensitive organ {{in close}} {{connection}} to the lacrimal gland. The distance between the lacrimal gland and the <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> the eye is short, and the diameter <b>of</b> the <b>eyeball</b> is approximately 24 [*]mm [32]. However, mean range for positrons produced from 68 Ga decay (positron emission decay 89 %, EC 11 %) is 3.5 [*]mm while the most energetic positrons can reach 9.2 [*]mm [33]. Consequently, the dimensions <b>of</b> the <b>eyeball</b> are large enough to stop almost all except for the most energetic positrons {{before they reach the}} lens. The Monte Carlo calculations result in an absorbed dose factor for the <b>lenses</b> <b>of</b> the eyes with a source in the lacrimal glands is 5.37 E− 14 [*]Gy/decay (0.192 [*]mGy/MBq[*]h in both glands). The major part of it (95 %) is due to the 511 [*]keV photons. This means that the contribution to the absorbed dose to the lens from the lacrimal glands is negligible in comparison with the dose {{from the rest of the}} body.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBased on {{a method}} of {{measuring}} intraocular pressure by the effect of piezoelectric bimorphs, a testing system for intraocular pressure is proposed.

The experimental result shows that the internal pressure <b>of</b> <b>eyeball</b> and the output current of intraocular bimorph have relatively good linear relationship within the range of human intraocular pressure, the linear relationship expression between intraocular pressure and current can be attained by using linear fitting method. The fitting function expression is used as calculation basis, the known intraocular pressure <b>of</b> simulation <b>eyeball</b> is measured, and measurement results show that the error is relatively small, which proves that this method is practical and feasible in a certain extent...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBackground: Glaucoma mainly {{induced by}} {{increased}} intraocular pressure (IOP), {{it was believed}} that the pressure that wall <b>of</b> <b>eyeball</b> withstands were determined by material properties of the tissue and stereoscopic geometry <b>of</b> the <b>eyeball.</b> In order to study the pressure changes in different parts <b>of</b> interior <b>eyeball</b> wall, it is necessary to develop a novel eye ball FEM with more accurate geometry and material properties. Use this model to study the stress changes in different parts <b>of</b> <b>eyeball,</b> especially the lamina cribrosa (LC) under normal physiological and pathological IOP, and provide a mathematical model for biomechanical studies of selected retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) death. Methods: (1) Sclera was cut into 3. 8 -mm wide, 14. 5 -mm long strips, and cornea was cut into 9. 5 -mm-wide and 10 -mm-long strips; (2) 858 Mini BionixII biomechanical loading instrument was used to stretch sclera and cornea. The stretching rate for sclera was 0. 3 mm/s, 3 mm/s, 30 mm/s, 300 mm/s; and for cornea were 0. 3 mm/s and 30 mm/s. The deformation-stress curve was recorded; (3) Naso-temporal and longitudinal distance of LC were measured; (4) Micro-CT was used to accurately scan fresh bovine eyes and obtain the geometrical image and data to establish bovine eye model. 3 -D reconstruction was performed using these images and data to work out the geometric shape of bovine eye; (5) IOP levels for eyeball FEM was set and the inner wall <b>of</b> <b>eyeball</b> was used taken as load-bearing part. Simulated eyeball FE modeling was run under the IOP level of 10 mmHg, 30 mmHg, 60 mmHg and 100 mmHg, and the force condition of different parts <b>of</b> <b>eyeball</b> was recorded under different IOP levels. Results: (1) We obtained the material parameters more in line with physiological conditions and established a more realistic eyeball model using reversed engineering of parameters optimization method to calculate the complex nonlinear super-elastic and viscoelastic parameters more accurately; (2) We observed the following phenomenon by simulating increased pressure using FEM: as simulative IOP increased, the stress concentration scope on the posterior half of sclera became narrower; in the meantime, the stress-concentration scope on the anterior half of scleral gradually expanded, and the stress on the central part of LC is highest...|$|R
