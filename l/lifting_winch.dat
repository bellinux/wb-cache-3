50|$|If {{the bell}} <b>lifting</b> <b>winch</b> or cable fails and cannot be {{restored}} to function, the bell may be recovered using the clump weight winch (guide wire winch). The clump weights are used to stabilise the bell during deployment, and the winch used to lower and lift the clump weight {{can be used as}} an emergency recovery system for the bell. If this also fails, a wet transfer abandonment may be possible.|$|E
50|$|Deployment usually starts by {{lowering}} the clump weight, which is a large ballast weight suspended from a cable which runs down one side from the gantry, {{through a set of}} sheaves on the weight, and up the other side back to the gantry, where it is fastened. The weight hangs freely between the two parts of the cable, and due to its weight, hangs horizontally and keeps the cable under tension. The bell hangs between the parts of the cable, and has a fairlead on each side which slides along the cable as it is lowered or lifted. Deployment of the bell is by a cable attached to the top. As the bell is lowered, the fairleads prevent it from rotating on the deployment cable, which would put twist into the umbilical and risk loops or snagging. The clump weight cables therefore act as guidelines or rails along which the bell is lowered to the workplace, and raised back to the platform. If the <b>lifting</b> <b>winch</b> or cable fails, and the bell ballast is released, a positively buoyant bell can float up and the cables will guide it to the surface to a position where it can be recovered relatively easily. The clump weight cable can also be used as an emergency recovery system, in which case both bell and weight are lifted together. An alternative system for preventing rotation on the lifting cable is the use of a cross-haul system, which may also be used as a means of adjusting the lateral position of the bell at working depth, and as an emergency recovery system.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} model-based {{technique}} for detecting wear in a multistage planetary gearbox used by lifting cranes. The proposed method establishes a vibration signal model {{which deals with}} cyclostationary and autoregressive models. First-order cyclostationarity is addressed by {{the analysis of the}} time synchronous average (TSA) of the angular resampled vibration signal. Then an autoregressive model (AR) is applied to the TSA part in order to extract a residual signal containing pertinent fault signatures. The paper also explores a number of methods commonly used in vibration monitoring of planetary gearboxes, in order to make comparisons. In the experimental part of this study, these techniques are applied to accelerated lifetime test bench data for the <b>lifting</b> <b>winch.</b> After processing raw signals recorded with an accelerometer mounted {{on the outside of the}} gearbox, a number of condition indicators (CIs) are derived from the TSA signal, the residual autoregressive signal and other signals derived using standard signal processing methods. The goal is to check the evolution of the CIs during the accelerated lifetime test (ALT). Clarity and fluctuation level of the historical trends are finally considered as a criteria for comparing between the extracted CIs. This study reveals the most relevant features to be used for damage detection and condition monitoring of the gear system. It is also shown that the proposed procedure using a combination of cyclostationarity and autoregressive modeling enhance the ability to detect and diagnose mechanical wear in multi-staged planetary gears...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The snap load alleviator (SLA) is a passive, hy-draulic, {{shock-absorbing}} {{backup system}} to mitigate snap loads in a launch and recovery {{system for a}} manned submersible. The SLA {{is part of a}} mitigation strategy for potential failures identified as part of a hazard analysis. This analysis considered failures in the active heave compensation system, which is the primary approach to compensate for vessel heave in rough seas. To reduce the size and weight of the SLA, it has been designed with a much shorter stroke than the magnitude of expected vessel heave. The SLA has low inertia and mitigates only the leading edge of a snap load while the rendering function of the <b>lift</b> <b>winch,</b> which has much higher inertia, deploys additional lift line before the SLA runs out of stroke. Tight coupling of the dynamic properties of the SLA and the <b>lift</b> <b>winch</b> is required for this approach to succeed. The rationale and the design of the SLA is presented. Computer simulations demonstrate the snap loading problem and validate the proposed solution. Hardware testing to qualify the design and to corroborate the simulations is described. I...|$|R
40|$|The 9977 and the 9975 {{shipping}} {{packages are}} used in various nuclear facilities within the Department of Energy. These shipping packages are often loaded in designated areas with designs using overhead cranes or A-frames with <b>lifting</b> <b>winches.</b> However, there are cases where loading operations must be performed in remote locations where these facility infrastructures do not exist. For these locations, a lifting apparatus {{has been designed to}} lift the containment vessels partially out of the package for unloading operations to take place.

5000|$|The {{dump truck}} {{is thought to}} have been first {{conceived}} in the farms of late 19th century western Europe. Thornycroft developed a steam dust-cart in 1896 with a tipper mechanism. The first motorized dump trucks in the United States were developed by small equipment companies such as The Fruehauf Trailer Corporation, Galion Buggy Co. and Lauth-Juergens among many others around 1910. Hydraulic dump beds were introduced by Wood Hoist Co. shortly after. Such companies flourished during World War I due to massive wartime demand. August Fruehauf had obtained military contracts for his semi-trailer, invented in 1914 and later created the partner vehicle, the semi-truck for use in World War I. After the war, Fruehauf introduced hydraulics in his trailers. They offered hydraulic <b>lift</b> gates, hydraulic <b>winches</b> and a dump trailer for sales in the early 1920s. Fruehauf became the premier supplier of dump trailers and their famed [...] "bathtub dump" [...] was considered to be the best by heavy haulers, road and mining construction firms.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a 9 {{degree of}} freedom seaweed {{harvester}} dynamical model is presented. The model presented describes the coupled dynamics of a vessel and a harvesting device, <b>lifted</b> by a <b>winch,</b> subject to sea waves disturbances. In order to find an appropriate harvesting path, which minimizes the harvester motions, the model response is simulated for different encounter angles. This 9 DOF seaweed harvester model is defined by merging the unified ship model, given in Fossen [1], Perez [2], including the seakeeping fluid memory effects, and the Nielsen [3], Fard [4] 9 DOF shipcrane model, which includes an elastic coupling between the vessel and the harvester, and computes the harvester hydrodynamics, as in [5]. For the ship-harvester elastic coupling, a linear stiffness matrix, based on Shashikala et al [6], has been computed. The model obtained also includes {{the effects of the}} vessel forward speed, the wave and current loads, the ship propellers and motion control forces, and the winch motor dynamics. The motor dynamic is based on the control-oriented models of Messineo et al [7]. A mathematical formulation is first presented, and its assumptions are discussed. Then, a model simulation, obtained by modifying the Fossen et al [8] Simulink MSS Toolbox, and its results, are discussed. The harvester position variance and the RMSE index are compared, for the simulation results of different harvesting paths, and a compromise solution is discussed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contain the}} process of {{creating}} a modular and mechanical landmine clearing tool for NMBU`s agricultural robot, Thorvald 2. In this thesis, there will be information about the problem with landmines today and how a landmine work, along with the development process for the product, including concept evaluation, calculations and simulations. The basic idea of the concept is that a load is to be dropped at the landmines location. The load will create a ground pressure that will trigger any pressure sensitive landmines. The load is a 25 kg heavy bag of sand and it will be dropped from a height of 1 meter. A <b>winch</b> <b>lifts</b> the load up and keeps it in the air. A clutch disconnects the drum {{from the rest of the}} winch system and the load drops to the ground. A scaffold is placed on the robot, with a pulley wheel at the top. The scaffold and the pulley wheel are designed and placed so that the pulley wheel is directly above the landmines, which are located in the middle and at the rear of the robot. A steel wire connects the load and the winch via the pulley wheel. The clutch is custom designed from scratch to fit the winch system. A linear actuator connects and disconnects the clutch. The winch is driven by a brushless direct current motor, along with a gearbox. Simulations done by FFI gives reason for optimism for the continuation of the project. A prototype is yet to be completed...|$|R
