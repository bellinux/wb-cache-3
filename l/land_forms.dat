In 1911, he moved to Inwood Country Club and remodeled the course over several years eventually leading to the course hosting the 1921 PGA Championship and the 1923 U.S. Open. On 16 September 1905 Strong partnered with 18-year-old Jerome Travers to tie for second place, shooting 72, in a four-ball tournament—part of the 1905 Metropolitan Open—that was held at Fox Hills Golf Club on Staten Island.|$|E

40|$|The whole farm {{financial}} {{effects of}} laser <b>land</b> <b>forming</b> were analysed using a two stage modelling procedure. In the first stage, linear programming models of representative Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA) rice farms {{were used to}} predict the profit-maximising activity mixes with and without successive increments of <b>land</b> <b>forming.</b> In the second stage, the profit-maximising activity mixes with and without an increment became inputs into a spreadsheet model designed to undertake discounted cash flow analysis of investment in the increment. The transition over time of yields to the achievable levels for <b>land</b> <b>formed</b> layouts was accounted for in the spreadsheet model, as were the effects of taxation (including taxation concessions for <b>land</b> <b>forming)</b> and access to concessional credit from the Special Conservation Scheme of the New South Wales Rural Assistance Authority. The analysis suggests that <b>land</b> <b>forming</b> the full area of a typical MIA rice farm is warranted, but that priority in allocating a limited capital budget {{should be given to}} areas requiring relatively low volumes of earth to be moved. A financial analysis of 'topsoiling' (replacing topsoil on areas from which it has been 'heavy cut' during <b>land</b> <b>forming)</b> showed it to generate considerably lower rates of return than <b>land</b> <b>forming.</b> Thus it appears <b>land</b> <b>forming</b> should be given priority overtopsoiling in allocating a limited capital budget.

The Wilmette Park District Board of Commissioners was appointed, serving {{the entirety of the}} [...] village, as well as a segment of northeast Evanston (responsibility for which was later assumed by the Evanston Park District). The Wilmette Park District's Board of Commissioners held their first meeting on February 17, 1908. State legislation was passed May 25, 1911 granting the Park District ownership of the landfill. The village acquired additional land bordering the landfill, including a parcel gifted to the village by Northwestern University. Ultimately, the Park District gained ownership of a riparian property stretching between Lake Avenue and Forest Avenue. Today, this <b>land</b> <b>forms</b> much of Gillson Park. The excavated material that formed the landfill turned out to largely consist of a relatively impervious blue clay. Mulchings and plantings began part of a years-long process of transforming the landfill into usable parkland.

I set off, therefore, in high spirits, for I felt that I had done good work and was bringing back a fine budget of news for my companions. Foremost of all, of course, were the sight of the fiery caves and the certainty that some troglodytic race inhabited them. But besides that I could speak from experience of the central lake. I could testify that it was full of strange creatures, and I had seen several <b>land</b> <b>forms</b> of primeval life which we had not before encountered.

60|$|The tides of the sea--as the {{two great}} flowings and ebbings of the water every twenty-four hours are called--are caused principally by the {{attractive}} influence of the moon, which, to a small extent, lifts {{the waters of the}} ocean towards it, as it passes over them, and thus causes a high wave. This wave, or current, when it swells up on the <b>land,</b> <b>forms</b> high tide. When the moon's influence has completely passed away, it is low tide. The moon raises this wave wherever it passes; not only in the ocean directly under it, but, strange to say, it causes a similar wave {{on the opposite side of}} the globe. Thus there are two waves always following the moon, and hence the two high tides in the twenty-four hours. This second wave has been accounted for in the following way: The cohesion of particles of water is easily overcome. The moon, in passing over the sea, separates the particles by her attractive power, and draws the surface of the sea away from the solid globe. But the moon also attracts the earth itself, and draws it away from the water on its opposite side thus causing the high wave there, as represented in the diagram, figure 1.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to analyze the potency of land water in the post tectonic earchquake at Merapi slope in Klaten regency, Central Java.

The collected data are in the <b>form</b> of <b>land</b> <b>form,</b> shallow <b>land</b> water data, suppressed land water, and well or spring. The results of the sesearch show that 1) the <b>land</b> <b>form</b> in Klaten is divided into four sets of landform, they are peak and slope of volcano, feet of volcano, fluvial palin under volcano, and a set of structural morphology. 2) The potency of land water can be tested based on the amount of land water and the quality of land water. The amount of land water in Klaten regency 260, 502, 274 m 3 /year or 727, 618, 722 liter/day. The amount of land water above is taken from free land water 73, 301, 436 m 3 /year, suppressed land water 34, 138, 520 m 3 /year, and land water taken from well or spring 153, 062, 784 m 3 /year. The quality of shallow land water in Klaten regency is proper to consume. 3) The distribution of upland water potency happens in the feet volcano <b>land</b> <b>form,</b> the potency of medium land water happens in the superficial of fluvial under volcano <b>land</b> <b>form,</b> and the potency of lowland water happens in the slope volcano <b>land</b> <b>form</b> and in the structural range of hills at Bayat subdistrict, 4) The tectonic earthquake gives serious effect toward morphological changes, land split, land subsident and the potency of land water in the fluvial plain of <b>land</b> <b>form</b> under volcano and structural range of hills in the area of Bayat subdistrict, and 5) In 2008, the needs of drinking water in Klaten regency is predicted around 1, 164, 000 people x 150 liter/day = 174, 600, 000 liter/day...|$|R
