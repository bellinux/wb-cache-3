40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{one approach}} to the scaling problem of machine learning (Chan and Stolfo 1995) namely the decomposition of large datasets into smaller subsets so that the <b>learning</b> task <b>on</b> each subset is greatly reduced {{in comparison to the}} learning task for the whole dataset. A previous study (Catlett 1992) has examined this approach and concluded that classifiers <b>learned</b> <b>on</b> a subset of available data were significantly less accurate that classifiers <b>learned</b> <b>on</b> training sets entire. We examine a different set of properties from those looked at by Catlett, focusing on the agreement between classifiers <b>learned</b> <b>on</b> subsets of a data set. Our intention is to use the information from the learning process and about the data set to iteratively construct improved subsets which improve the classification performance of classifiers <b>learned</b> <b>on</b> them with a view to distributing the learning process over a number of processors and thus reduce overall learning time.

For example, <b>learning</b> <b>on</b> simple tasks, if restricted in sensory input and motor output to one hemisphere of a split-brain animal, would not transfer to the other hemisphere. The right brain has no idea what the left brain is up to, if these specific connections are cut. Those experiments were followed by tests on human beings with epilepsy who had undergone split-brain surgery, which established that the neocortical connections between hemispheres are the principal route for cognition to transfer {{from one side of the}} brain to another. These experiments also formed the modern basis for lateralization of function in the human brain.|$|E

25|$|According to Harry A. Poeze, Malaka {{assumed that}} the colonial {{government}} used the educational system to produce educated indigenous people who would repress their own people. Malaka founded Sekolah Sarekat Islam to rival the government schools. Syaifudin writes that Malaka had four different methods of teaching: dialog, jembatan keledai, critical discussion, and sociodrama. In dialog method, Malaka used two-way communication while teaching. During his time teaching in Deli, he encouraged students to criticize their teacher, or the Dutchman, who was often wrong. In the SI school, he entrusted students who received higher grades to teach students with lower grades. Jembatan keledai was inspired by al-Ghazali; in addition to memorizing knowledge, the students were instructed to understand {{and apply it to}} their daily lives. Syaifudin writes that it is the opposite of bank style concept, and that it is similar to contextual teaching and <b>learning.</b> <b>On</b> critical discussion, Malaka not only verbally gave a problem to the students, but attempted to expose the problem directly, a method is similar to the problem-posing method of Paulo Freire.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{explored the}} neural mechanisms underlying the learning and consolidation of novel spoken words. In Experiment 1, participants learned {{two sets of}} novel words on successive days. A subsequent recognition test revealed high levels of familiarity for both sets. However, a lexical decision task showed that only novel words <b>learned</b> <b>on</b> the previous day engaged in lexical competition with similar-sounding existing words. Additionally, only novel words <b>learned</b> <b>on</b> the previous day exhibited faster repetition latencies relative to unfamiliar controls. This overnight consolidation effect was further examined using fMRI to compare neural responses to existing and novel words <b>learned</b> <b>on</b> different days prior to scanning (Experiment 2). This revealed an elevated response for novel compared with existing words in left superior temporal gyrus (STG), inferior frontal and premotor regions, and right cerebellum. Cortical activation was of equivalent magnitude for unfamiliar novel words and items <b>learned</b> <b>on</b> the day of scanning but significantly reduced for novel words <b>learned</b> <b>on</b> the previous day. In contrast, hippocampal responses were elevated for novel words that were entirely unfamiliar, and this elevated response correlated with postscanning behavioral measures of word learning. These {{findings are consistent with}} a dual-learning system account {{in which there is a}} division of labor between medial-temporal systems that are involved in initial acquisition and neocortical systems in which representations of novel spoken words are subject to overnight consolidation...|$|R
25|$|Among {{the notable}} {{features}} of Baghdad {{during this period}} were its exceptional libraries. Many of the Abbasid caliphs were patrons of learning and enjoyed collecting both ancient and contemporary literature. Although some of the princes of the previous Umayyad dynasty had begun to gather and translate Greek scientific literature, the Abbasids {{were the first to}} foster Greek <b>learning</b> <b>on</b> a large scale. Many of these libraries were private collections intended only {{for the use of the}} owners and their immediate friends, but the libraries of the caliphs and other officials soon took on a public or a semi-public character. Four great libraries were established in Baghdad during this period. The earliest was that of the famous Al Mamun, who was caliph from 813 to 833. Another was established by Sabur Ibn Ardashir in 991 or 993 for the literary men and scholars who frequented his academy. Unfortunately, this second library was plundered and burned by the Seljuks only seventy years after it was established. This was a good example of the sort of library built up out of the needs and interests of a literary society. The last two were examples of madrasa or theological college libraries. The Nizamiyah was founded by the Persian Nizam al Mulk, who was vizier of two early Seljuk sultans. It continued to operate even after the coming of the Mongols in 1258. The Mustansiriyah madrasa, which owned an exceedingly rich library, was founded by Al Mustansir, the second last Abbasid caliph, who died in 1242. This would prove to be the last great library built by the caliphs of Baghdad.|$|E

In December 2005, Rancic made it clear that he wanted to continue working for Trump, and in April 2006 his contract was renewed for a third year. In that year Donald Trump's children began to assume prominent public roles as in the Trump Organization; by January 2007 all three adult Trump children (Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., and Eric Trump) were executives in the acquisitions and development division of the organization. By the time the Chicago Trump Tower's hotel opened in the building in January 2008, Donald Trump and his three adult children were in the spotlight, overseeing the construction.|$|E
500|$|Guitar Hero and Rock Band have {{introduced}} people to rock music and inspired {{them to learn}} how to play the guitar. A study by Youth Music found that 2.5 million out of 12 million children in the United Kingdom have begun learning how to play real instruments after playing music video games such as Guitar Hero. The group believes that these video games can be incorporated into music educational programs. Guitar teachers in the US have reported an increase in students who cite Guitar Hero as their inspiration to start <b>learning.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, industry professionals, such the inventor of the Fretlight practice tool, have expressed scepticism over the game's educational value. There is anecdotal evidence that Guitar Hero aids rhythm and general hand-coordination, but also that it creates a false preconception of the difficulty of learning guitar, which can lead students to discontinue their studies. Guitar Center conducted a survey which found that a majority of instrument-based rhythm gamers intended to take up a real instrument in the future while a majority of those who were already musicians had been inspired to play their instruments more. Despite such popularity the guitar remains less popular {{than it was in the}} 1960s. Some musicians have been critical of Guitar Heros impact on music education. Jack White of The White Stripes stated that he was disappointed to learn that video games are the most likely venue where younger audiences will be exposed to new works, while Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin does not believe that people can learn how to play real instruments from their video game counterparts. Similarly, Prince has turned down opportunities to have his music in the Guitar Hero series, stating that he felt that it was [...] "more important that kids learn how to actually play the guitar". Other commentators have pointed to drum controllers (including the expanded, lifelike Drum Rocker kit) used in such games as potentially useful in learning and creating music with real drums.|$|E
