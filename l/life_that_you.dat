5|$|O you, Son, who, {{concealed}} in your mother's womb, you gather together peoples by your Father's act – for I perchance {{am able to}} compose a holy narrative because you are seen to be God, because, glorious one, the glittering stars show (you) to the world; and I ask, after the close of my <b>life,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> grant {{to me from the}} throne of heaven to take a tiny gift because of the honour (I have) attained.|$|E
500|$|Zappa {{stated that}} he tried smoking {{cannabis}} ten times, but without any pleasure or result beyond sleepiness and sore throat, and [...] "never used LSD, never used cocaine, never used heroin {{or any of that}} other stuff." [...] Zappa stated, [...] "Drugs do not become a problem until the person who uses the drugs does something to you, or does something that would affect your <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't want to have happen to you, like an airline pilot who crashes because he was full of drugs." [...] He was a regular tobacco smoker for most of his life, and strongly critical of anti-tobacco campaigns.|$|E
500|$|... "This idea of The Fame {{runs through}} and through. Basically, {{if you have}} nothing—no money, no fame—you can still feel {{beautiful}} and dirty rich. It's about making choices, and having references—things you pull from your <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> believe in. It's about self-discovery and being creative. The record is slightly focused, but it's also eclectic. The music is intended to inspire people to feel a certain way about themselves, so they'll be able to encompass, in their own lives, a sense of inner fame that they can project to the world, and the carefree nature of the album {{is a reflection of}} that aura. I like to funnel interesting ideas {{to the rest of the}} world through a pop lens." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} also {{physically}} released {{as a single}} in the United States and Canada. The promotional version, released in both countries, includes an extended and a shortened version of [...] "Jubilation". The main United States edition features B-side track [...] "Everything's Been Changed", another song written by Anka. [...] "Jubilation", along with other tracks on the album, is primarily a gospel song. The track was written by Anka and Johnny Harris, with the latter musician solely producing it. It was mastered by Robin C. Kruse and recorded at Bell Sound Studios in New York City during 1972. In the lyrics, the protagonist preaches and discusses religious themes: [...] "Sinners take the key / For the <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> lead is deceiving / Nothing replaces a man / That embraces believing, no".|$|E
500|$|In June 2010, Marvel Television was {{launched}} with Jeph Loeb as head. By July 2012, the division had entered into discussions with ABC {{to create a}} show set in the MCU, and in August, ABC ordered a pilot for a show called S.H.I.E.L.D., with The Avengers writer/director Joss Whedon involved; it was later renamed Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. In January 2014, the series Marvel's Agent Carter was announced, joining Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. at ABC, while a put pilot order for the half-hour live-action comedy series, Marvel's Damage Control, was revealed in October 2015. While talking about Marvel potentially making comedy series, Loeb said in January 2016 that Marvel always feels humor should {{be a part of}} anything they produce, despite possibly fitting more within a darker genre, as Daredevil and Jessica Jones do, while also staying [...] "grounded and real". He added, [...] "There are moments of levity that are in <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> need to bring to the table, or else it just becomes overwhelmingly oppressive ... If you're going to , it's always a good idea {{to make sure that the}} audience is aware that, yeah, it's funny [...]" ...|$|E

[...] Top Spot was given an 18 certificate by the British Board of Film Classification, much to Emin's dismay, as she intended the film for a teenage audience.|$|E

2500|$|The BBC {{described}} {{academic research}} that indicated that goths are [...] "refined and sensitive, keen on poetry and books, not big on drugs or anti-social behaviour". Teens often {{stay in the}} subculture [...] "into their adult life", and {{they are likely to}} become well-educated and enter professions such as medicine or law. The subculture carries on appealing to teenagers who are looking for meaning and for identity. The scene teaches teens that there are difficult aspects to <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> [...] "have to make an attempt to understand" [...] or explain.|$|E
2500|$|Lewis {{discussed}} {{the inspiration for}} the song in an interview with Entertainment Weekly: [...] "e felt like happiness is something everyone strives to have, and sometimes it's not just about being happy, but if you have obstacles in your <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have to get over to be happy. And it's just about that striving to get there. t was kind of like looking back at all of the things I've been through, just kind of putting that into the song." [...] The song was released with two B-sides: [...] "Let It Rain" [...] in Europe and Japan, and [...] "Fly Here Now", only in Japan.|$|E
