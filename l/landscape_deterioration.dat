Our study illustrates a procedure estimating the extension of ground-mounted photovoltaic fields at themunicipal scale in Italy and inferring the socioeconomic profile of the Italianmunicipalities experiencing different expansion rates of groundmounted photovoltaic fields {{over the last years}} (2007 - 2014). The procedure was based on diachronic information derived from official data sources integrated into a geographical decision support system. Our results indicate that the surface area of ground-mounted photovoltaic fields into rural land grew continuously in Italy between 2007 and 2014 with positive and increasing growth rates observed during 2007 - 2011 and positive but slightly decreasing growth rates over 2012 - 2014, as a result of market saturation and policies containing the diffusion of solar plants on greenfields. We found important differences in the density of ground-mounted solar plants between northern and southern Italian municipalities. We identified accessible rural municipalities in southern Italy with intermediate population density and large availability of non-urban land as the most exposed to the diffusion of solar plants on greenfields in the last decade. Our approach is a promising tool to estimate changes in the use of land driven by the expansion of photovoltaic fields into rural land...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We report {{results from}} roughly 20, 000 runs of a coupled {{agent-based}} model {{of land use}} change and species metacommunity model. We explored the effect of increasing government incentive to improve biodiversity, {{in the context of}} other influences on land manager decision making: aspirations, input costs, and price variability. The experiments test four kinds of policy varying along two dimensions: activity-versus-outcome-based incentive, and individual-versus-collective incentive. The results reveal critical thresholds in incentive schemes, where a sudden increase in environmental benefit occurs for a small increase in incentive. Further, the context affects the level of incentive at which tipping points occur, and the degree of effect. Variability in outcome can also change with incentive and context, and some evidence suggests that environmental benefits are not monotone increasing functions of incentives. Intuitively, if the incentive signal is large enough, land managers will farm the subsidy; and if the subsidy does not exactly match desired <b>landscape</b> outcomes, <b>deterioration</b> in environmental benefits may occur for higher incentives...|$|R
40|$|Natural visual <b>landscape</b> {{is under}} <b>deterioration</b> due to {{improper}} construction and planning in modern development of China. One {{of the main}} reasons is the feebleness in planning supporting methodology and technology in respect for natural visual landscape. In such supporting information, landscape evaluation always acts as a significant component. Especially in comprehensive planning, it is the only approach to access visual value distribution in large-scale region. In this paper, we present a GISbased natural visual landscape evaluation tool through a case study. By an integrated rating statistics function of this tool, visual quality of natural landscape is quantified through analysis in visibility, landuse, and visual resource quality. Then we make comprehensive planning strategies based on this scientific supporting tool. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of this tool by comparing these strategies with schemes of the same project conducted through traditional planning module. This comparative study reveals the efficiency and effectiveness of the tool as well as its implementation in large-scale comprehensive urban planning...|$|R
40|$|Many recent {{developments}} in coastal science have gone against the demands of European Union legislation. Coastal dune systems which cover small areas of the earth can host {{a high level of}} biodiversity. However, human pressure on coastal zones around the world has increased dramatically in the last 50 years. In addition to direct habitat loss, the rapid extinction of many species that are unique to these systems can be attributed to <b>landscape</b> <b>deterioration</b> through the lack of appropriate management. In this paper, we propose to use of an ecosystem classification technique that integrates potential natural vegetation distribution as a reference framework for coastal dune EU Habitats (92 / 43) distribution analysis and assessment. As an example, the present study analyses the EU Habitats distribution within a hierarchical ecosystem classification of the coastal dune systems of central Italy. In total, 24 land elements belonging to 8 land units, 5 land facets, 2 land systems and 2 land regions were identified for the coastal dunes of central Italy, based on diagnostic land attributes. In central Italy, coastal dune environments including all the beach area, mobile dunes and all the fixed-dune land elements contain or could potentially hold at least one EU habitat of interest. Almost all dune slack transitions present the potentiality for the spontaneous development of EU woodlands of interest. The precise information concerning these ecosystems distribution and ecological relationships that this method produces, makes it very effective in Natura 2000 European network assessment. This hierarchical ecosystemclassification method facilitates the identification of areas to be surveyed and eventually bound, under the implementation of EU Habitat directive (92 / 43) including areas with highly disturbed coastal dune ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} land {{abandonment}} on biodiversity have received considerable attention by scholars, but results {{are far from}} conclusive. Different cultural traditions of scientists seem to underlie the contrasting ways in which land abandonment is understood. Although the forest transition (FT) framework considers land abandonment {{as an opportunity for}} biodiversity conservation, European landscape ecologists characterize it as a threat. We use insights from both traditions to analyze the effects of land abandonment on landscape and biodiversity in a mountain area of metropolitan Barcelona. We do so through an in-depth historical case study covering a period of 160 years. A set of landscape metrics was applied to land-cover maps derived from cadastral cartography to characterize the landscape ecological changes brought about by land abandonment. Cadastral data on land uses were used to understand how landscape ecological changes could be explained by changing socioeconomic activities. Information on past land-management practices from semistructured interviews was used to shed light on how peasants shaped the capacity of landscape to host biodiversity. Our results point to a remarkable <b>landscape</b> <b>deterioration</b> along with the disappearance of the peasant land-use mosaics and the ensuing forest expansion. By using insights from landscape ecology in a historically informed manner, we (1) question the alleged relationship between land abandonment and ecosystem recovery; (2) show that the assumed restorative character of the FT is based on the underestimation of the ecological importance of nonforest habitats; and (3) point at a remarkable trade-off between FT and biodiversity in the Mediterranean. Finally, the case study also serves to illustrate some of the strengths and challenges of using historical approaches to land abandonment...|$|E
40|$|Agricultural land {{abandonment}} and {{the consequent}} natural forest regrowth in areas once cultivated has significantly transformed Alpine ecosystems and landscapes. In this paper, we estimated the loss of agricultural areas due to reafforestation in the Belluno Province (Eastern Italian Alps) and integrated socioeconomic indicators with topographical features to evaluate the drivers of this change. Land use mapping, obtained from photo-interpretation of aerial photographs and technical maps, was used to quantify changes in forest and agricultural areas (crops, meadows and pastures) {{during the period of}} 1980 – 2000. On average, the forest surface expanded by 21 %, while the agricultural areas decreased by 40 %. This loss increased in areas with steeper slope, which confirms that the areas that would be first abandoned are those that are less productive and more difficult to manage. The reafforestation rate was particularly strong in the north of the province, where the livestock sector experienced a dramatic decline. In light of this situation and using multiple regression models with a large set of socioeconomic and agricultural indicators, we found that the loss of agricultural areas in 69 municipalities was primarily counterbalanced by the maintenance of livestock farming. The loss of steeper agricultural areas was counteracted by traditional extensive systems; however, it was not counteracted by modern intensive systems, which has important implications because steeper areas have higher landscape and biodiversity values. In addition, tourism development had a positive, although smaller, effect on the maintenance of agricultural areas, while industry development had a negative effect. The {{results of this study suggest}} that efforts are needed to maintain a territorial network of traditional extensive farms to avoid further <b>landscape</b> <b>deterioration</b> in Alpine areas. Likewise, certain choices toward the economic development of local communities might have an impact on land conservation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Transposable {{elements}} (TEs), both DNA transposons and retrotransposons, are genetic elements {{with the}} main characteristic {{of being able to}} mobilize and amplify their own representation within genomes, utilizing different mechanisms of transposition. An almost universal feature of TEs in eukaryotic genomes is their inability to transpose by themselves, mainly as the result of sequence degeneration (by either mutations or deletions). Most of the elements are thus either inactive or non-autonomous. Considering that the bulk of some eukaryotic genomes derive from TEs, they have been conceived as “TE graveyards. ” It has been shown that once an element has been inactivated, it progressively accumulates mutations and deletions at neutral rates until completely losing its identity or being lost from the host genome; however, it has also been shown that these “neutral sequences” might serve as raw material for domestication by host genomes. Results We have analyzed the sequence structural variations, nucleotide divergence, and pattern of insertions and deletions of several superfamilies of TEs belonging to both class I (long terminal repeats [LTRs] and non-LTRs [NLTRs]) and II in the genome of Anopheles gambiae, aiming at describing the <b>landscape</b> of <b>deterioration</b> of these elements in this particular genome. Our results describe a great diversity in patterns of deterioration, indicating lineage-specific differences including the presence of Solo-LTRs in the LTR lineage, 5 ′-deleted NLTRs, and several non-autonomous and MITEs in the class II families. Interestingly, we found fragments of NLTRs corresponding to the RT domain, which preserves high identity among them, suggesting a possible remaining genomic role for these domains. Conclusions We show here that the TEs in the An. gambiae genome deteriorate in different ways according to the class to which they belong. This diversity certainly has implications not only at the host genomic level but also at the amplification dynamic and evolution of the TE families themselves. </p...|$|R
40|$|Open {{spaces in}} the urban <b>landscapes</b> suffer from <b>deterioration</b> caused by man that leads to two major outcomes: on one side they are {{abandoned}} because of newer contemporary needs, {{on the other hand}} they tend to be “cannibalized” in the attempt to satisfy our society. This has caused a progressive retraction of urban open spaces that have become residual spaces with no shape and no name. This course of crisis has damaged the identity of places and this is more acute in historic urban landscapes that are recognised as cultural heritage and world heritage. The historic urban landscape approach suggested by UNESCO recognises public spaces’ importance for society and promotes the acknowledgement of public spaces and their dynamism aiming to the integration of preservation, social development and economic targets. To understand how “historic urban landscapes” are taking care of their public spaces, a few Management Plans of UNESCO’s World Heritage cities have been compared. Only Italian UNESCO sites with an “urban complex” characterisation have been considered, this means a limited part of a city with homogenous characteristics from a spatial, historic and cultural point of view. We have focused our attention on the specific interventions for the management of open spaces, in order to identify the major targets and their executive tools, projects and actions. In the light of the above-mentioned analyses, we propose some strategies to fight the decline of public spaces (streets, squares, gardens, etc.) and to enhance these spaces with great attention, trying to improve their fruition and comfort according to their historic and cultural values. The need to identify design strategies to enhance public spaces within the historic urban landscape is included in the research and test activities carried out in the UNESCO site of Mantova and Sabbioneta. This site is an excellent area of applicability because of its urban shape, molded in years by the Gonzaga family. Together with the UNESCO Mantova e Sabbioneta office, we have involved citizens in the requalification design to activate regaining process and test the applicability of our analyses in the city of Mantova, a very articulated and complex reality, starting from the fruition of its places and according to its morphological, environmental, cultural and perceptive aspects...|$|R
40|$|It is {{imperative}} to understand the strong coupling between the carbon capture process and water use to sustainably manage rangelands. Woody encroachment is undermining rangelands grass production. Evapotranspiration (ET) highlights the links between ecosystem carbon capture process and water use. It forms the biggest flux of the hydrological cycle after precipitation yet it is not well understood. The Grassland and the Albany Thicket (AT) biomes in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, provide an interesting space to study the dynamics in rangelands biomass production and the associated water use. Therefore, {{the main purpose of}} this study was to contribute towards management of rangelands by understanding the dynamics in rangeland grass production and water use. To achieve this aim, the impact of Acacia mearnsii, an invasive alien plant, on soil chemical properties and rangelands grass production was investigated. This was achieved by analysing the biophysical attributes of A. mearnsii as they related to grass production. Secondly, selected soil variables that could be used as a prognosis for <b>landscape</b> recovery or <b>deterioration</b> were evaluated. In addition, aboveground grass biomass was measured in areas cleared of A. mearnsii and regression equations were prepared to help model aboveground grass biomass in areas cleared of A. mearnsi. The thesis also explored dynamics in water vapour and energy fluxes in these two biomes using an eddy covariance system. Consequently, water vapour and energy fluxes were evaluated in order to understand landscape water use and energy partitioning in the landscape. The study also tested the application of Penman-Monteith equation based algorithms for estimating ET with micrometeorological techniques used for validation. Pursuant to this, the Penman- Monteith-Leuning (PML) and Penman-Monteith-Palmer (PMP) equations were applied. In addition, some effort was devoted to improving the estimates of ET from the PMP by incorporating a direct soil evaporation component. Finally, the influence of local changes in catchment characteristics on ET was explored through the application of a variant of the Budyko framework and investigating dynamics in the evaporative index as well as applying tests for trends and shifts on ET and rainfall data to detect changes in mean quaternary catchment rainfall and ET. Results revealed that A. mearnsii affected soil chemical properties and impaired grass production in rangelands. Hence, thinning of canopies provided an optimal solution for enhanced landscape water use to sequestrate carbon, provide shade, grazing, and also wood fuel. It was also shown that across sites, ET was water limited since differences between reference ET and actual ET were large. ET was largely sensitive to vapour pressure deficit and surface conductance than to net radiation, indicating that the canopies were strongly coupled with the boundary layer. Rangeland ET was successfully simulated and evaporation from the soil was the dominant flux, hence there is scope for reducing the so-called ‘unproductive’ water use. Further, it was shown that the PML was better able to simulate ET compared to the PMP model as revealed by different model evaluation metrics such as the root mean square error, absolute mean square error and the root mean square observations standard deviation ratio. The incorporation of a soil evaporation component in the PMP model improved estimates of ET as revealed by the root mean square error. The results also indicated that both the catchment parameter (w) and the evaporative index were important in highlighting the impacts of land cover change on ET. It was also shown that, despite changes in the local environment such as catchment characteristics, global forces also affected ET at a local scale. Overall, the study demonstrated that combining remote sensing and ground based observations was important to better understand rangeland grass production and water use dynamics...|$|R
40|$|To {{prevent the}} {{overexploitation}} {{of the marine}} ecosystem and to conserve biodiversity, the Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) {{are one of the}} most common tools, but their management and effectiveness depend on how the local population and the main stakeholders perceive them other than the existence of a good and proper management plan. This work uses the questionnaire methodology to assess how a MPA can lead benefit (Ecosystem Services) for the local people and how the stakeholder, in turn, perceive and evaluate the MPAs presence. The analysis is performed by comparing two MPAs: the first one is the “Parque Natural del Estrecho” in the autonomous community of Andalusia (Spain) while the second one is the “Area Marina Protetta di Porto Cesareo” in the Apulian region (Italy). The interviews are realized on four categories of stakeholders: diving workers, small-scale fishermen, recreational fishermen and tourism service operators. Stakeholder highlighted the lack of monitoring for the activity of the non-professional fishermen, that often use unauthorised fishing gears, sell their catches and fish more than the five kilograms (Reg. CE 1967 / 2006) allowed by the law, damaging the environmental conservation and the small-scale fisheries. Moreover, a high number of tourists leads to positive economical incomes for many local activities, also connected with an environmental friendly tourism, but if this tourism activity is not well managed could lead to negative environmental effects, due to the pollution or to the natural <b>landscape</b> <b>deterioration</b> (e. g. dunes). The results of this work confirm partially the precedents studies on MPAs but also highlight some new perceptions about the ecosystem services provided by MPAs. This study demonstrates that the perception of the stakeholder can change during the years and that the benefits of the presence of the MPA are not always obtained immediately...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present welfare {{estimates}} from a contingent valuation (CV) study which investigates {{the potential benefits}} derived by tourists from {{the implementation of a}} programme aimed at preserving the traditional agricultural landscape in a typical Mediterranean area: the National Park of Cilento (Southern Italy). Here, under current market conditions, farming activities are being gradually abandoned. As a result, the alternative to the cultivated landscape is a much less appealing one, where the various stages of progression of land abandonment dominate. To ease the cognitive task of respondents, CV responses were elicited using the discrete choice referendum format. To supplement the inherent inefficiency of discrete choice responses one follow-up question was also administered. The sample responses are analysed by three methods. First, by a log-normal model which allows a random utility interpretation. Then by a series of beta models, which require the definition of the maximum in the range of willingness to pay and reflect a purely statistical approach. Finally, by means of the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier-Turnbull probability estimates, which is robust to potential parametric mis-specifications. The welfare estimates obtained by various methods were similar and approached one Euro per day-visit. Our results indicate that referendum CV provides plausible estimates of WTP for agricultural landscape conservation from the tourists' population. From a conservative inference it appears that in 1997 the traditional farming produced a landscape externality for tourists which reached at least 8 million Euro. Provision of landscape {{is only one of many}} unremunerated activities provided by farmers, so more research should be aimed at valuing public goods produced by farming in recreationally valuable areas and elsewhere. We argue that the policy tools currently employed in the European Common Agricultural Policy, for the purpose of rural landscape preservation, are inadequate in the context of typical Mediterranean agriculture. Here the main cause of rural <b>landscape</b> <b>deterioration</b> seems to be the abandonment of agricultural production, rather than its intensification, so the main features of interest are other than those currently protected by EU policy...|$|E

The consequences of foremost pressures to European coastal areas, respectively to the Black Sea such as water pollution, eutrophication, loss of biological diversity, introduction of non-indigenous species, over fishing, land use and <b>landscape</b> <b>deterioration,</b> and coastal erosion have been already well documented (Moncheva et al., 2001, Prodanov et al., 2001, Gubanova et al., 2002, Kamburska, 2004, Kideys et al., 2005, Oguz, 2005, Kamburska et al., 2006). Insufficiency of comparable time series data across the coastal areas of the Black Sea is still a key problem for a comprehensive assessment of the marine environment. The present study {{is focused on the}} comparison of the zooplankton quality and quantity parameters in two vulnerable coastal areas Sevastopol Bay (Northern Black Sea) and Varna Bay (Western Black Sea). It aims to assess the current state and long-term trends of zooplankton communities of the two regions of the Black Sea and the response to anthropogenic and environmental shifts. The objectives are: 1) to reveal the structure of zooplankton community in both areas; 2) to contrast temporal variability of the plankton fauna structure in the coastal ecosystems of Northern and Western Black Sea. Observations are based on the long-term data for mesozooplankton abundance, key species and taxonomic groups, temperature and salinity collected at monitoring stations in Varna and Sevastopol Bays during the period 1967 - 2005 (Varna Bay) and 1976 - 2005 (Sevastopol Bay). The results of inter-annual dynamics of mesozooplankton quantity revealed similarities in the timing of maximum abundance during the 1980 s in both areas. The structure of the community significantly shifted over the decades and the reorganization was mainly with respect to dominant groups and species. Thus Oithona nana maintained high density in the period 1976 - 1980, while Acartia clausi (dominant over the year) and Pleopis polyphemoides were constant components of the plankton fauna with similar dynamics mode in the study regions. In spite of the observed similarities, zooplankton communities in Varna and Sevastopol Bays manifested peculiar features. The total abundance in Varna Bay ranged from 1083 ind. m- 3 to 52 978 ind. m- 3, while in Sevastopol Bay it varied from only 276 ind. m- 3 to 14501 ind. m- 3. During the period 1976 - 1980, the zooplankton amount in Sevastopol Bay was from 2 to 12 fold higher than in Varna Bay. Since the 1980 the total mesozooplankton abundance increased in Varna Bay in contrast to Sevastopol Bay. Noctiluca scintillans was regularly presented in Sevastopol Bay, but with lower numerical abundance compared to Varna Bay where it often reached ¿blooming¿ concentrations. The alterations in zooplankton assemblages could be further attributed to the impacts of climate and anthropogenic activities in both regions. JRC. DDG. H. 3 -Global environement monitorin...|$|E

40|$|Easter Island (Rapa Nui) is {{a remote}} Pacific island {{known for its}} megalithic statues, the moai, built by an ancient culture which {{disappearance}} is still debated. Theories claiming for either self-destruction (ecocide) of this ancient culture or an eventual genocide after the European contact {{have been the most}} popular. Anthropogenic drivers have been traditionally preferred as causes of this major cultural shift, whereas climatic changes have been dismissed or underrated. However, the latest findings suggest that the topic is more complex than formerly thought and demand a more holistic perspective. This paper reviews the main paleoclimatic, paleoecological, archaeological and historical evidence of the major Rapanui cultural shift leading {{to the end of the}} moai-building civilization and uses an integrated approach to analyze its timing and potential causes. The disappearance of the ancient Eastern Island culture that erected the moai was a dramatic cultural shift with significant changes in lifestyle, socio-political organization, religious performance, art and also in the geographical settlement of the cultural core of the Rapanui society. The ancient society, represented by the so called Ancient Cult (or moai cult) was centered on the Rano Raraku crater, to the east of the island, whose soft volcanic rocks (tuff) where suitable for moai carving. This society was replaced by the Birdman-Cult society, based on Rano Kao, to the westernmost end of the island. The assumed date for such shift is uncertain ranging between mid- 16 th and late- 18 th centuries. It is suggested that such geographical change, as well as the associated societal transformations, may have been the result of a combination of climatic, ecological and cultural drivers and events. The latest paleoecological reconstructions show that the Rano Raraku catchment was deforested by AD 1450 and the lake inside dried out by AD 1550 owing to an intense climatic drought. This would have caused a <b>landscape</b> <b>deterioration</b> transforming the Raraku catchment into a wasteland devoid of freshwater and unsuitable for human life and the cultural flourishment that characterized the Ancient-Cult society. The drought lasted for about a century and a half and would have forced the Rapanuis to look for alternative freshwater sources. The only feasible option was the freshwater lake inside the then forested Rano Kao crater, where the ceremonial village of Orongo, the center of the Birdman Cult, was funded by AD 1600. The Kao crater is made of hard volcanic rocks (basalts) unsuitable for moai carving by the Neolithic Rapanui culture, unaware of metals, which would have contributed to the end of the moai-building phase. Deforestation and drought would have led to a general demographic decline. The shift from the rigid socio-political organization of the Ancient Cult to the more flexible system characteristic of the Birdman Cult could be viewed as a cultural adaptation to changing environmental conditions. The occurrence of a further, rather catastrophic, genocide caused by slave trading and epidemic diseases, occurred shortly after the European contact (AD 1722), has been documented historically. Therefore, the Rapanui civilization has undergone at least two cultural crises caused by natural and anthropogenic drivers. A complex synergistic scenario like that proposed here can conciliate multidisciplinary lines of evidence formerly used to defend more simplistic and apparently contradictory hypotheses of cultural change. © 2016 Elsevier LtdPeer reviewe...|$|E
