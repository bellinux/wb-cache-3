40|$|Abstract: According to the {{shortage}} of the traditional <b>offset</b> <b>line</b> in Doherty power amplifier, a new <b>offset</b> <b>line</b> technique is proposed to match carrier amplifier with the load and to improve {{the performance of the}} Doherty amplifier. By simulation of the computer software, a higher efficiency is obtained using the new <b>offset</b> <b>line</b> comparing the two kinds of <b>offset</b> <b>lines.</b> The new <b>offset</b> <b>line</b> technique could be applied in the system with high linearity and low power operation.

30|$|Sarhan and Hassan [4] {{analyzed}} available stopping {{sight distance}} (SSD) on horizontal curves with roadside or median barriers in 3 Dimension (3 D) combined alignments by using finite element technique software.

The design aids presented in this research, which include available SSD, the horizontal sightline offset (HSO), and different alternatives of overlapping vertical curves, considered open roads SSD criteria where most range of horizontal sight <b>line</b> <b>offset</b> (HSO) is not practical for implementation in a bounded cross section or derives uneconomical wide shoulders which can mislead the drivers by using them as another travel lane or a parking lay-bay.

40|$|A {{combined}} {{experimental and}} analytical {{study was conducted}} to investigate and predict the failure modes of a graphite/epoxy laminate subjected to combined bearing and bypass loading. Tests were conducted in a test machine that allowed the bearing-bypass load ratio to be controlled while a single-fastener coupon was loaded to failure in either tension or compression. Onset and ultimate failure modes and strengths were determined for each test case. The damage-onset modes were studied in detail by sectioning and micrographing the damaged specimens. A two-dimensional, finite-element analysis was conducted to determine lamina strains around the bolt hole. Damage onset consisted of matrix cracks, delamination, and fiber failures. Stiffness loss appeared to be caused by fiber failures rather than by matrix cracking and delamination. An unusual offset-compression mode was observed for compressive bearing-bypass laoding in which the specimen failed across its width along a <b>line</b> <b>offset</b> from the hole. The computed lamina strains in the fiber direction were used in a combined analytical and experimental approach to predict bearing-bypass diagrams for damage onset from a few simple tests...|$|E

40|$|Reinforced earth wall {{system has}} become very popular because of its {{aesthetic}} value and ease of construction.

In this paper, field instrumentation work carried out on a reinforced earth wall is described with the objective of capturing the essential behaviour of the wall during and after construction. Two different wall conditions were considered, that is, in the first case, the wall is allowed to move laterally and in the other case, the wall is not flexible in transverse direction. Based on the observations made, it can be concluded that the locus of maximum tension is a vertical <b>line</b> <b>offset</b> approximately 0. 35 H away from the facing. For lateral pressure, it is seen that the curve for the flexible facing follows similar trend as the curve for the rigid facing except that the horizontal pressure at the flexible facing is generally slightly lower.

40|$|AbstractLinear static {{analysis}} with an alternate load path using dynamic amplification factor (DAF) {{is often used}} for redundancy and progressive collapse analysis of steel truss bridges to avoid using the more time-consuming dynamic analysis. This study presents an empirical equation to calculate the DAF {{for this type of}} analysis against the initial sudden member fracture. Currently, this analysis employs an approximate model with a single degree of freedom to calculate the DAF. With a 5 % damping ratio, the constant DAF of 1. 854 is used for all types of steel truss bridges. However, this approach is inaccurate because the DAF varies between bridges and with the location of the fractured members as well. Considering some of the approaches developed for building structures but adapting them to steel truss bridges, this paper proposes an empirical equation that allows for the computation of the DAF from the maximum norm stress σis/σiy in static linear elastic analysis of the damaged model with a member removal. A total of 30 illustrative cases for two typical steel truss bridges are investigated to obtain the data points for the empirical equation. The proposed empirical equation is the enveloped <b>line</b> <b>offset</b> from the best fit line for the data points in illustrative cases...|$|E
40|$|The {{wide area}} {{coverage}} and great data density afforded by quantitative multibeam sonars provides {{the potential for}} statistical evaluation of seafloor backscatter {{and an understanding of}} the characteristics of the seafloor. The multibeam data gathered using a Simrad EM 3000 sonar during SAX- 99 is particularly suited for quantitative seafloor studies because of the tremendous overlap in the data gathered, the constant depth range of the seafloor, the availability of auxiliary data sets and the relatively homogeneous seafloor types in the survey area. A total of 307 lines were gathered in several directions with an average <b>line</b> <b>offset</b> of 10 m in a central area of 600 × 600 m, resulting in an average density of 125 soundings/m^ 2. The massive redundancy provides for robust analysis of the data and allows for error analysis, extraction of a statistically realistic representation of the bathymetry, and thus true radiometric correction of backscattered values. This geometry also allows us to evaluate mean backscatter as a function of grazing angle for any given piece of seafloor, thus obviating the need to assume a homogeneous seafloor across the swath. These preliminary analyses allow us to approach the problem of remote seafloor segmentation and characterization using the dependence of backscatter on grazing angle with more confidence...|$|E

40|$|We examine {{spectral}} {{properties of}} the SDSS quasar J 093201. 60 + 031858. 7, in particular the presence of strong blue peaks in the Balmer emission <b>lines</b> <b>offset</b> from the narrow lines by approximately 4200 km/s. Asymmetry in the broad central component of the Hbeta line indicates {{the presence of a}} double-peaked emitter. However, the strength and sharpness of the blue Hbeta and blue Hgamma peaks make this quasar spectrum unique amongst double-peaked emitters identified from SDSS spectra. We fit a disk model to the Hbeta line and compare this object with other unusual double-peaked quasar spectra, particularly candidate binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Under the binary SMBH scenario, we test the applicability of a model in which a second SMBH may produce the strong blue peak in the Balmer lines of a double-peaked emitter. If there were only one SMBH, a circular, Keplerian disk model fit would be insufficient, indicating some sort of asymmetry is required to produce the strength of the blue peak. In either case, understanding the nature of the complex line emission in this object will aid in further discrimination between a single SMBH with a complex accretion disk and the actual case of a binary SMBH.
