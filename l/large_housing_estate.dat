25|$|From 1932 to 1956, {{an airport}} was located {{to the east}} of the town. It began as a {{civilian}} airfield, but during World War II it became a Royal Air Force fighter station, RAF Gravesend, and so Gravesend was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe. In 1956 the site was taken over by Gravesend Town Council; a <b>large</b> <b>housing</b> <b>estate</b> known as Riverview Park was built on its site.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSince the 1960 s, <b>large</b> <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> {{have shaped}} the {{geography}} of suburbia in many Western and Eastern European cities. This paper examines {{the constitution of the}} social and spatial meanings of <b>large</b> <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> within three different national contexts: in Germany, Poland, and France. Employing discourse theory and an empirical analysis of the coverage of major national newspapers, we identify cross-national and specific national patterns of discourses that (re) produce particular social spaces and distinct social orders. Quantitative discourse analysis reveals differences, similarities, and ruptures in various constructions of the meaning of <b>large</b> <b>housing</b> <b>estates.</b> We find that <b>large</b> <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> in France and Germany are constituted in print media as threatening places and as places of foreignness located "outside" the "proper society. " In contrast, Polish <b>large</b> <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> are framed discursively as threatened places located in the social "inside. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Large</b> <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> built after Second World War {{are often}} seen as a {{problematic}} areas in many cities all over Europe. This paper focuses on <b>large</b> <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> in Łódź. The {{purpose of this study}} is to characterise the socio-demographic structure in nine <b>largest</b> <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> in Łódź in the light of statistical data such as: age structure of population, household types, educational structure and identify changes which have occurred during the transformation period in these estates. In this paper it is shown that the socio-demographic changes observed in the estates, e. g. ageing population, increase in the number of single-person households, decreased percentage of active earners, and improved education background coincide with the processes that are taking place in the entire city and vary by period of their construction...|$|R

25|$|The first council {{houses were}} built in the Dimbles area of the city in the 1930s. The {{outbreak}} of World War II brought over 2,000 evacuees from industrialised areas. However, {{due to the lack of}} heavy industry in the city, Lichfield escaped lightly, although there were air raids in 1940 and 1941 and three Lichfeldians were killed. Just outside the city, Wellington Bombers flew out of Fradley Aerodrome, which was known as RAF Lichfield. After the war the council built many new houses in the 1960s, including some high-rise flats, while the late 1970s and early 1980s saw the construction of a <b>large</b> <b>housing</b> <b>estate</b> at Boley Park in the south-east of the city. The city's population tripled between 1951 and the late 1980s.|$|E
500|$|Much {{development}} {{with a large}} increase in housing occurred from the mid-18th century. In 1873, [...] of common land north of the town known as Portfield was enclosed and built upon and the town's population rapidly expanded. During the 20th century further development has seen the population grown from a little over 11,000 to more than 45,000. In the 1950s a <b>large</b> <b>housing</b> <b>estate</b> was built {{to the east of}} the town centre and in 1958 a bypass was constructed which redirected traffic using the town's high street as the main thoroughfare to and from London and Southampton. In 1974 the town was transferred from the county of Hampshire to Dorset following local government reorganisation and was granted borough status by a Royal Charter.|$|E
2500|$|He {{received}} a professorship at the Staatliche Akademie für Kunst und Kunstgewerbe Breslau (Breslau Academy for Arts and Crafts) where he taught until its closure in 1932. In 1919 he had joined Bruno Taut's expressionist architects group the Glass Chain. In 1926 {{he entered the}} architects association Der Ring. In 1927 Scharoun built {{a house in the}} Stuttgart Weissenhof Estate. He had responsibility {{at the end of the}} twenties for the development plan of a <b>large</b> <b>housing</b> <b>estate,</b> Siemensstadt, in Berlin. Hugo Häring's theory of the new building inspired Scharoun in a new architectural direction that departed from rationalism and from preformulated schemata, in order to develop buildings starting in each case from a unique functional character. [...] The organisation of social living space played a central role.|$|E
40|$|Some of the {{problems}} associated with <b>large</b> <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> in Western Europe are emerging in Slovenia. Others, such as vacancies and high turnover, have yet to become significant problems in Slovenia. Moreover, {{the problems}} arising from poor construction are far less prevalent in Slovenia than in the West due to greater regulating control over construction standards after 1963 aimed at protecting buildings from earthquakes. Following the extensive privatization of the social housing stock after 1991, a range of new problems have emerged in Slovenia. There are already indications that the unsuccessful handling of maintenance problems after the introduction of housing reform, coupled with the absence of relevant legislative backup, may lead to the worsening of living conditions in some of the country's <b>large</b> <b>housing</b> <b>estates.</b> Owing also to the growing socio-economic polarization of the inhabitants {{as a consequence of the}} shift to a market-based economy, the transition period has also been marked by a slow but steady trend of outward migration of better-off households from <b>large</b> <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> to more favourable locations. Consequently, there is a risk that, in the first place, the <b>large</b> <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> might become residential enclaves of low-income households. This may, in turn, lead to their degradation and the corresponding negative attributes of such neighbourhoods. This paper discusses the outcomes of research carried out at the Urban Planning Institute of the Republic of Slovenia on the development of appropriate methods for the renovation of <b>large</b> <b>housing</b> <b>estates.</b> Guided by the research findings and supported by an extensive review of the various renewal strategies that have been applied in different countries, we propose a framework for the regeneration of <b>large</b> <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> in Slovenia. This framework represents a comprehensive approach to <b>housing</b> <b>estate</b> renewal and improvement, extending from the physical analysis of the buildings and their surroundings to the evaluation of the measures as implemented. Proposals for administrative, legislative and financial measures necessary to support the framework are also put forward. Housing Renewal Housing Management Slovenia,...|$|R

2500|$|Hollington grew {{substantially}} in the 19th and 20th centuries, {{in line with}} the rest of Hastings. [...] The population was 338 in 1831, 3,677 in 1931 and about 7,500 in 1939. [...] Nevertheless, it retained its village character until the 1960s, when the borough council selected it as the site for a large council estate. [...] The expansion of the 1920s and 1930s had been driven by council housing, and in 1962 the council proposed to continue and extend this scheme by demolishing much of the old village and laying out a <b>large</b> <b>housing</b> <b>estate.</b> [...] More private and council housing has since been added, and Hollington has now lost its rural setting. [...] The ancient woodland around the church has been preserved, though, and is one of six nature reserves in the borough of Hastings.|$|E

40|$|At {{the turn}} of the {{millennium}} about one third of the inhabitants of Budapest lived at <b>housing</b> <b>estates.</b> Since then this rate has slightly declined because of new constructions.
