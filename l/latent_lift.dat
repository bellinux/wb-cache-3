He was conclusively {{identified by}} means of forensic examinations conducted by the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia. When Gerhartsreiter, using the name Clark Rockefeller, was arrested, his fingerprint impressions were taken by FBI agents in Baltimore and by Boston Police when he was returned to Massachusetts. Those fingerprints were compared to <b>latent</b> fingerprints <b>lifted</b> {{from a variety of}} sources. They matched a <b>latent</b> print <b>lifted</b> from a wine glass in Boston collected {{at the time of the}} search for [...] "Rockefeller" [...] and his daughter earlier in the month. Those fingerprints also match a latent print developed from a document in Gerhartsreiter's immigration file from the early 1980s. Although there were no fingerprint cards or inked impressions in the immigration file, an FBI laboratory was able to develop latent print impressions from a document in that file, which had been provided by the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Through fingerprint analysis, the FBI confirmed his identity.|$|R
40|$|Hybrid continuous-discrete models {{naturally}} represent many {{real-world applications}} in robotics, finance, and environmental engineering. Inference with large-scale models is challenging because relational structures deteriorate rapidly during inference with observations. The main contribution {{of this paper}} is an efficient relational variational inference algorithm that factors largescale probability models into simpler variational models, composed of mixtures of iid (Bernoulli) random variables. The algorithm takes probability relational models of largescale hybrid systems and converts them to a close-to-optimal variational models. Then, it efficiently calculates marginal probabilities on the variational models by using a <b>latent</b> (or <b>lifted)</b> variable elimination or a lifted stochastic sampling. This inference is unique because it maintains the relational structure upon individual observations and during inference steps. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Matching unknown <b>latent</b> {{fingerprints}} <b>lifted</b> from {{crime scenes}} to full (rolled or plain) fingerprints {{in law enforcement}} databases is of critical importance for combating crime and fighting terrorism. Compared to good quality full fingerprints acquired using live-scan or inking methods during enrollment, latent fingerprints are often smudgy and blurred, capture only a small finger area, and have large nonlinear distortion. For this reason, features (minutiae and singular points) in latents are typically manually marked by trained latent examiners. However, this introduces an undesired interoperability problem between latent examiners and automatic fingerprint identification systems (AFIS); the features marked by examiners are not always compatible with those automatically extracted by AFIS, resulting in reduced matching accuracy. While the use of automatically extracted minutiae from latents can avoid interoperability problem, such minutiae {{tend to be very}} unreliable, because of the poor quality of latents. In this paper, we improve latent to full fingerprint matching accuracy by combining manually marked (ground truth) minutiae with automatically extracted minutiae. Experimental results on a public domain database, NIST SD 27, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

40|$|In {{forensic}} science the finger marks left unintentionally by {{people at a}} crime scene are referred to as "latent fingerprints". Most existing techniques to detect and <b>lift</b> <b>latent</b> fingerprints require application of certain material directly onto the exhibit. The chemical and physical processing applied onto the fingerprint potentially degrades or prevents further forensic testing on the same evidence sample. Many existing methods also come with deleterious side effects. We introduce a method to detect and extract latent fingerprint images without applying any powder or chemicals on the object. Our method is based on the optical phenomena of polarization and specular reflection together with the physiology of fingerprint formation. The recovered image quality is comparable to existing methods. In some cases like the sticky side of a tape our method show...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{evidential value}} of palmprints in {{forensic}} applications is clear as about 30 {{percent of the}} latents recovered from crime scenes are from palms. While biometric systems for palmprint-based personal authentication in access control type of applications have been developed, they mostly deal with low-resolution (about 100 ppi) palmprints and only perform full-to-full palmprint matching. We propose a latent-to-full palmprint matching system that is needed in forensic applications. Our system deals with palmprints captured at 500 ppi (the current standard in forensic applications) or higher resolution and uses minutiae as features to be compatible with the methodology used by latent experts. Latent palmprint matching is a challenging problem because <b>latent</b> prints <b>lifted</b> at crime scenes are of poor image quality, cover only a small area of the palm, and have a complex background. Other difficulties include {{a large number of}} minutiae in full prints (about 10 times as many as fingerprints), and the presence of many creases in latents and full prints. A robust algorithm to reliably estimate the local ridge direction and frequency in palmprints is developed. This facilitates the extraction of ridge and minutiae features even in poor quality palmprints. A fixed-length minutia descriptor, MinutiaCode, is utilized to capture distinctive information around each minutia and an alignment-based minutiae matching algorithm is used to match two palmprints. Two sets of partial palmprints (150 live-scan partial palmprints and 100 latent palmprints) are matched to a background database of 10, 200 full palmprints to test the proposed system. Despite the inherent difficulty of latent-to-full palmprint matching, rank- 1 recognition rates of 78. 7 and 69 percent, respectively, were achieved in searching live-scan partial palmprints and latent palmprints against the background database...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} combining direct chemical analysis of latent fingerprints with subsequent bio-metric analysis within a single sample. The method described here uses ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) as a chemical detection method for explosives and narcotics trace contami-nation. A collection swab coated with a high-temperature adhesive has been developed to <b>lift</b> <b>latent</b> fingerprints from various surfaces. The swab is then directly inserted into an IMS instrument for a quick chemical analysis. After the IMS analysis, the lifted print remains intact for subsequent biomet-ric scanning and analysis using matching algorithms. Several samples of explosive-laden fingerprints were successfully lifted and the explosives detected with IMS. Following explo-sive detection, the lifted fingerprints remained of sufficient quality for positive match scores using a prepared gallery consisting of 60 fingerprints. Based on our results (n= 1200), {{there was no significant}} decrease in the quality of the lifted print post IMS analysis. In fact, for a small subset of lifted prints, the quality was improved after IMS analysis. The described method can be readily applied to domestic criminal investigations, transportation security, terrorist and bombing threats, and military in-theatre settings...|$|R

Analysis of surface, upper air observations and model outputs reveals that the event was initiated by synoptic scale conditions that intensified by interaction with the local topography, triggering strong winds and high convective rainfall. The model predicted the observed characteristics of both rainfall and winds well, accurately predicting the maximum wind speed of 20 – 25 [*]m[*]s− 1 that was sustained for about 2 [*]h. A time series analysis of various atmospheric variables suggests a sudden fall in pressure, temperature and outgoing long wave radiation before {{the development of the}} storm, followed by a significant increase in wind speed, latent and moisture fluxes and change in wind direction during the mature stage of the storm. The model outputs suggest that the heavy rainfall was induced by a low-level moisture supply from the Red Sea combined with orographic <b>lifting.</b> <b>Latent</b> heat release from microphysical processes increased the vertical velocities in the mid-troposphere, further increasing the low-level convergence that strengthened the event...|$|R
40|$|Fingerprint based {{identification}} {{is one of}} the most mature and proven technique compare to the all biometric technique. In crime sense fingerprints have been extensively used for identification of criminals. Fingerprints are classified as rolled, plain and latent fingerprints. <b>Latent</b> fingerprints are <b>lifted</b> from surface of objects that are unintentionally touched by person. Latent means poor quality of images or unclear image i. e. smudgy, blurred, moist, small area or fingerprints that contains fewer amount of minutiae. Matching latent fingerprints over rolled or plain fingerprints that is difficult task. Therefore, it is necessary to extract all fingerprint features that are present in latent fingerprint images for accurate matching. Although tremendous progress has been made AFIS (Auto-mated Fingerprint Identification System), this system works well only in that case where rolled and plain fingerprint images. There-fore, semi-automatic system is feasible for feature extraction of la-tent images i. e. some human intervention is allowed during feature extraction from latent fingerprint images. Before feature ex-traction performed it is necessary to improve the quality of la-tent image because they are lifted from any surface and it is easy to extract features from improved quality of latent images. Then outputs candidates are matched over rolled fingerprint images by using fully automatic system. This paper presents study of various techniques that are useful for latent fingerprint matching...|$|R
40|$|Micro- and {{nano-scale}} truss architectures provide mechanical strength, light weight, and breatheability in polymer barriers. Liquid evaporation {{and transport}} of resulting vapor through truss voids (pores) cools surfaces {{covered by the}} barriers, suggesting the possibility for simultaneous protection of humans from mechanical and thermal stresses. Design of real systems employing this technique requires quantitative understanding of vapor transport within the truss pores and accompanying <b>latent</b> heat <b>lift</b> under ambient temperature and pressure. One application is desert Soldier protection. Need exists to clarify whether smaller pore diameters affect surface cooling and water vapor transport owing to fluid rarefaction or surface interactions. Contrasting previous studies where pressure within capillaries of fixed diameter was modulated, in this thesis Knudsen Number (Kn) was systematically varied by changing pore diameter at constant pressure (one atmosphere). Cooling efficacy was assessed for porous membranes with pore diameters ranging from 39 to 14, 400 nm, varied in regular increments. Evaporative cooling experiments simulated combined daytime desert solar and metabolic thermal load on humans by heating an evaporation chamber partially filled with liquid water and capped with a porous membrane. (cont.) Hot, dry gas was swept over the membrane, simulating desert ambient conditions. By continuously weighing the entire evaporation apparatus, intrinsic pore diffusion coefficients for dilute water vapor in air were deduced for each membrane by correcting for upstream and downstream boundary layer mass transfer resistances. Pore diameter impact on evaporative cooling of an underlying surface by water vapor transport across two types of porous polymer membranes with micro/nano-scale truss architecture was quantified. This research showed that transition diffusion regime theory predicted observed transport rates to better than + 35 % for pore diameters between 14, 400 nm and 60 nm (0. 01 < Kn < 3). Despite low membrane porosity, substantial Fractional Accomplished Cooling (up to 60 % maximum achievable) was demonstrated via latent heat transport. The absolute magnitude of achieved surface cooling was 3. 7 K to 14. 0 K. An engineering design correlation was developed linking latent heat transport at various Knudsen Numbers (pore diameters) to evaporative cooling efficacy. Results of this research inform design of porous mechanical barriers that permit evaporative cooling of underlying surfaces. by Matthew J. Tram. Thesis (Ph. D.)
