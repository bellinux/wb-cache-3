5|$|One of {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} elements of the painting is the ring on the model's ring finger. Resting on the mantle piece, it becomes a {{focal point of the}} composition. The ring was a device of which Whistler was conscious; it had not been present in The White Girl. Though he and Hiffernan were not married, the ring showed a development in how he represented her in his art; from prostitute in Wapping, to mistress in The White Girl, and finally a wife in The Little White Girl. At the same time, this development reflected Whistler's notion of his own position in the English art world: towards greater legitimacy. The ring is also an allusion to the Christian sacrament of marriage, which <b>lends</b> <b>a</b> religious aspect to the aestheticism that he and Swinburne were trying to develop.|$|E
5|$|Regular series {{character}} designer Yoshitaka Amano's concept art {{became the}} basis for the models in the full motion videos produced for the game's PlayStation re-release. Tetsuya Takahashi, one of the graphic directors, drew the imperial Magitek Armors seen in the opening scene. By doing so, he disregarded Sakaguchi's intention to reuse the regular designs from elsewhere in the game. The sprite art for the characters' in-game appearance was drawn by Kazuko Shibuya. While in the earlier installments, the sprites were less detailed on the map than in battle, Final Fantasy VIs had an equally high resolution regardless of the screen. This enabled the use of animations depicting a variety of movements and facial expressions. Though it was not the first game to utilize the Super NES' Mode 7 graphics, Final Fantasy VI made more extensive use of them than its predecessors. For instance, unlike both Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy V, the world map is rendered in Mode 7, which <b>lends</b> <b>a</b> somewhat three-dimensional perspective to an otherwise two-dimensional game.|$|E
5|$|This artistic {{period is}} one of {{discovery}} of the expressive possibilities of the human body; {{there is a greater}} freedom in the poses and gestures, and an increased attention to anatomical verisimilitude, as may be observed in the ponderated stances of figures W9 and W4, who partially anticipate the Doryphoros of Polykleitos. There is a noticeable ease to the physiques of the frieze compared with the stiffness of the metopes along with an eye for such subtleties as knuckle joints, veins, and the careful articulation of musculature. One important innovation of the style is the use of drapery as an expression of motion, or to suggest the body beneath; in archaic and early classical sculpture, clothing fell over the body {{as if it were a}} curtain obscuring the form below, in theses sculptures there is the billowing chlamydes of the horsemen and the multi-pleated peploi of the women that <b>lends</b> <b>a</b> surface movement and tension to their otherwise, static poses. Variation in the manes of the horses has been of particular interest to some scholars attempting to discern the artistic personalities of sculptors who laboured on the frieze or perhaps, indicating deliberate representation of different regional traditions, so far this Morellian analysis has been without conclusion.|$|E

500|$|Andrew Adamson {{described}} {{the film as}} being darker, as it takes place [...] "another 1300 years later, [...] Narnia has been oppressed by Telmarines for a large period of that time, so it's a dirtier, grittier, darker place than the last world was". He added, [...] "This one {{is more of a}} boy's movie. It's a harsher world. The villains are human, and that <b>lends</b> <b>a</b> more realistic attitude." [...] Creatures were designed by veteran horror and monster concept artist Jordu Schell and supervised by Howard Berger, who said that Prince Caspian would be more medieval than The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Alongside Adamson, Berger's children critiqued his designs, aiding the process: his son thought the werewolf's ears were silly, so they were made smaller.|$|E

Rediff said, [...] "The highlight in Gemini is undoubtedly Kalabhavan Mani's performance. [...] As the paan-chewing Gemini, Vikram, too, delivers a convincing performance." [...] However, Sify found the cast to be the film's major drawback and scrutinised, [...] "Vikram as Gemini is unimpressive [...] Kalabhavan Mani an excellent actor hams as he plays a villain [...] Top character actor Murali is also wasted in the film." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century William Shakespeare wrote a number of dramatisations of {{historic}} figures. The use of history as a backdrop, against which the familiar characters act out Shakespeare's drama, <b>lends</b> <b>a</b> sense of realism to his plays. [...] Shakespeare wrote a three-part play about Henry VI, relying heavily on Hall's chronicle as a source. [...] His vision of the Battle of Towton (Henry VI, Part 3, Act2, Scene5), touted as the [...] "bloodiest" [...] engagement in the Wars of the Roses, became a set piece about the [...] "terror of civil war, a national terror that is essentially familial". [...] Historian Bertram Wolffe said it was thanks to Shakespeare's dramatisation of the battle that the weak and ineffectual Henry was at least remembered by English society, albeit for his pining {{to have been born}} a shepherd rather than a king.|$|E

Additional filming also took place on location in Paris for two days, with Dalton noting that [...] "it <b>lends</b> <b>a</b> kind of authenticity to the show and production value." [...] When the crew was scouting locations, the weather was [...] "almost too perfect", but during shooting it was foggy and raining, which Dalton described as [...] "more authentic" [...] rather than unnecessarily [...] "picaresque".

500|$|Providing {{examples}} of historical structures built around trees, or with 'guardian trees' around {{or in the}} structure in Germanic areas, Davidson states that the [...] "'luck' of a family must largely depend on the successful bearing and rearing of sons, {{and there is a}} general belief that when a guardian tree is destroyed, the family will die out." [...] In connection with this, Davidson theorizes that at the bridal feast, it should have been Siggeir, the bridegroom, who drew the sword from the tree, [...] "and that its possession would symbolize the 'luck' which would come to him with his bride, and the successful continuation of his own line in the sons to be born of the marriage". The sword having been refused to him, Davidson theorizes that this may well have been intended as a deadly insult, and that this <b>lends</b> <b>a</b> tragic air to the scene in the hall.|$|E

500|$|Later in 2012, Lawrence {{played a}} young {{depressed}} widow named Tiffany Maxwell in David O. Russell's romance movie Silver Linings Playbook. The film was {{an adaptation of}} the Matthew Quick's novel of the same name. It follows her character finding companionship with Pat Solitano Jr. (played by Bradley Cooper), a man with bipolar disorder. The actress was drawn to her character's complex personality: [...] "She didn't really fit any basic kind of character profile. Somebody who is very forceful and bullheaded is normally very insecure, but she isn't". Russell considered Lawrence to be too young for the part; she convinced him to hire her via a Skype audition. She found herself challenged by Russell's spontaneity as a director, and described working on the project as the [...] "best experience of my life". Richard Corliss of Time wrote: [...] "Just 21 when the movie was shot, Lawrence is that rare young actress who plays, who is, grown-up. Sullen and sultry, she <b>lends</b> <b>a</b> mature intelligence to any role." [...] Peter Travers believed that Lawrence [...] "is some kind of miracle. She's rude, dirty, funny, foulmouthed, sloppy, sexy, vibrant, and vulnerable, sometimes {{all in the same}} scene, even in the same breath." [...] She won the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film, becoming—at age 22—the second youngest Best Actress Oscar winner. Her final release of the year was alongside Max Thieriot and Elisabeth Shue in Mark Tonderai's critically panned thriller House at the End of the Street.|$|E
