The fact that Ni readily substitutes for Mg in garnierite explains why as NiO content goes up, MgO content goes down. The nickel in garnierite is not evenly {{distributed throughout the}} structure, but is concentrated in small zones of nickel surrounded by magnesium zones. Garnierite is a <b>layer</b> <b>silicate.</b> The main difference between the serpentine-like and talc-like variants of garnierite is the spacing between layers in the structure, seen in x-ray powder diffraction studies. The serpentine-like variants have 7 Å basal spacings while the talc-like variants have a basal spacing of 10 Å. At 106X magnifications, the 7 and 10 Å layer spacings (d(001)) are obvious and measureable, with the 7 Å spacings being better defined than the 10 Å spacings. 7 Å, serpentine-like minerals show rod and tube shaped particles, as well as platy particles and fluffy particles that are most likely aggregates while the 10 Å variety shows much less variation in particles, showing only platy and fluffy forms with very few tube or rod shaped particles. Some particles exhibit interstratification of 7 and 10 Å spacings. There is no correlation between NiO content and {{the shapes of the}} particles in the mineral. 7 Å type garnierites usually resemble chrysotile or lizardite in their structures, while 10 Å types usually resemble pimelite.|$|E

40|$|Four {{profiles}} of grey degraded soils and of sandy soils {{were collected from}} different agro-ecological regions in Vietnam and subjected to clay mineral analysis in addition to particle-size analysis. The result showed that those soils had the low clay while high sand contents in the upper layers or throughout the profile. This was ascribed to decomposition of <b>layer</b> <b>silicate</b> minerals in the upper layers and/or downward shifting of clay particles in a profile for grey degraded soils and to inheritance from the parent material for sandy soils. Predominant minerals detected in the clay fraction were kaolin (kaolinite and halloysite (0. 7 nm)) and quartz for both soil types. The present study indicated two opposite processes of soil development. For grey degraded soils, reduction in the clay content with decomposition of <b>layer</b> <b>silicate</b> minerals was enhanced with advancement of soil degradation. As a result, they became sandy-like soils with domination of quartz in the clay fraction. For sandy soils, on the other hand, their particle-size distribution and clay mineralogical composition were changed naturally by enrichment with clay particles from surrounding environment. The latter process suggests a possibility of fertility improvement of poor soils by mixing with more fertile materials such as alluvial soils, river sediments and weathered rock materials, {{in addition to the}} traditional measures such as intensive application of chemical fertilizers and addition of large amounts of organic amendments...|$|E

Enhanced lifetime food packaging, substrates for OLED based flexible displays and long duration scientific balloons are among them. Higher material requirements in these applications drive the need for an accurate measurement system. Therefore, a new system was engineered with enhanced sensitivity and accuracy. Permeability of polymers is affected by permeant solubility and diffusion. One effort to decrease diffusion rates is via increasing the transport path length. We explore this through dispersion of <b>layered</b> <b>silicates</b> into polymers. <b>Layered</b> <b>silicates</b> with effective aspect ratio of 1000 : 1 have shown promise in improving the barrier and mechanical properties of polymers. The surface of these inorganic silicates was modified with surfactants to improve the interaction with organic polymers. The micro and nanoscale dispersion of the <b>layered</b> <b>silicates</b> was probed using optical and transmission microscopy as well as x-ray diffraction. Thermal transitions were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry. Mechanical and permeability measurements were correlated to the dispersion and increased density. The essential structure-property relationships were established by comparing semicrystalline and amorphous polymers. Semicrystalline polymers selected were nylon- 6 and polyethylene terephthalate. The amorphous polymer was polyethylene terphthalate-glycol. Densification due to the <b>layered</b> <b>silicate</b> in both semicrystalline and amorphous polymers was associated with significant impact on barrier and long term creep behavior.

The tensile properties of these materials were found to be highly dependent upon the size of the <b>layered</b> <b>silicates.</b> A decrease in disk diameter was associated with a sharp upturn in the stress-strain curve and a pronounced increase in tensile strength.

The improved tensile properties of the nanocomposites containing the smaller nanofillers resulted from the <b>layered</b> <b>silicates</b> aligning in the direction of strain and interacting with the TPU sequences via secondary bonding. This phenomenon contributes predominantly above 400 % strain once the microdomain architecture has largely been disassembled.

One of the most striking results from morphological studies by transmission electron microscopy is that although the <b>layered</b> <b>silicates,</b> locally stacked in the PA- 12 matrix, are arranged on planes parallel to the injection molding direction, the fine lamellae are oriented with their planes perpendicular to the injection molding direction owing to nucleation at the interface between <b>layered</b> <b>silicate</b> and polymer matrix. The dispersion of <b>layered</b> <b>silicates</b> and the orientation of lamellae are reflected in the complexity of the deformation mechanisms, which in turn determine the ultimate macroscopic properties. From studies of in situ deformation under the high voltage electron microscope, it is concluded that the main deformation mechanism is microvoid formation inside the stacks of <b>layered</b> <b>silicates.</b> According to the orientation of these stacks the applied energy is dissipated by splitting, opening or sliding of separate bundles in the stacks during deformation. The nanofiller particles are load-bearing because surfaces in the microvoids are connected and hinder further growth of the microvoids, thus preventing catastrophic failure. As a consequence, the stiffness/strength/toughness balance has been synergistically improved. Finally, based on the present experimental results, a molecular network in polymer nanocomposites is proposed, that leads to the desired superfunctional characteristics.

40|$|Abstract. Montmorillonite (MMT), {{a typical}} <b>layered</b> <b>silicate,</b> {{has been widely}} used to prepare {{modified}} asphalt. This paper investigates the high temperature performance and low temperature property on <b>layered</b> <b>silicate</b> modified asphalt concrete. The control concrete is prepared by base asphalt. Meanwhile, three-point bending, conventional and SHRP rutting tests are {{used to compare the}} properties of the two types of asphalt concrete. The results of conventional and SHRP rutting tests show that the modified asphalt concrete exhibits a better high temperature performance than the control concrete. And the maximum bending strength of modified asphalt concrete is higher than that of control concrete at the same temperature. It can be concluded that both the high temperature performance and low temperature property of asphalt concrete has been improved efficiently by utilization of <b>layered</b> <b>silicate</b> modified asphalt...|$|R
40|$|To {{identify}} {{the effect of}} reactive preparation on the structure and properties of rigid polyurethane (PU) <b>layered</b> <b>silicate</b> nanocomposite, a range of nanocomposites were prepared by combining the various precursors in different sequences. The morphology of the samples was characterized by XRD and TEM. Tensile properties and dynamic mechanical thermal properties were measured. The reactions between the <b>layered</b> <b>silicates</b> and PU precursors were monitored via FTIR to {{gain an understanding of}} the participation of nanofiller in the polymerization reaction, and the impact of this on system stoichiometry. The XRD and TEM results provided evidence that morphology can differ significantly if different synthesis methods are used. However, the mechanical properties are dominated by the stoichiometry imbalance induced by the addition of the <b>layered</b> <b>silicates.</b> (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
