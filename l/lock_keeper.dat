Bridges Almshouses were built around 1685 and may have been for the widows of those killed in the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Netham Lock is {{the point}} at Netham in Bristol at which boats from the River Avon, gain access to Bristol's Floating Harbour. Construction started in 1804 to build the tidal New Cut, where it is joined by the River Malago, and divert the Avon along the Feeder Canal to the harbour; a system {{designed}} and built by William Jessop and later improved by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. A weir carries the river into the New Cut and boats use the adjacent lock. Access to the harbour is only possible during {{the day when the}} <b>lock</b> <b>keeper</b> will open the gates unless the water level in the river between Netham and Hanham is above or below the level of the harbour. Netham Lock and the weir form part of Bristol's flood defence mechanisms and it was announced in December 2008 that they would be upgraded as part of the £11 million City Docks Capital Project.|$|E

2500|$|Loosely, {{a flight}} of locks is simply a series of locks in close-enough {{proximity}} {{to be identified as}} a single group. For many reasons, {{a flight of}} locks is preferable to the same number of locks spread more widely: crews are put ashore and picked up once, rather than multiple times; transition involves a concentrated burst of effort, rather than a continually interrupted journey; a <b>lock</b> <b>keeper</b> may be stationed to help crews through the flight quickly; and where water is in short supply, a single pump can recycle water {{to the top of the}} whole flight. The need for a flight may be determined purely by the lie of the land, but it is possible to group locks purposely into flights by using cuttings or embankments to [...] "postpone" [...] the height change. Examples: Caen Hill locks, Devizes.|$|E

50|$|A <b>Lock</b> <b>keeper,</b> Lock Tender, or lock {{operator}} looks after a canal or river lock, operating {{it and if}} necessary maintaining it or organizing its maintenance.
