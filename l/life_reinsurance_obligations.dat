40|$|The {{improvements}} in longevity observed {{in many countries}} {{over the past century}} have been significant. The risk that the longevity experience is higher than the one forecasted, i. e. longevity risk, is explicitly consideredin Solvency II standard formula as a sub-module of the life underwriting risk module. The life underwriting risk module includes all the <b>life</b> insurance and <b>reinsurance</b> <b>obligations,</b> except the SLT health insurance obligations (EIOPA 2012), where the longevity risk is one of the seven sub-modules. According to Solvency II, solvency capital requirements (from herein SCRs) can be computed by a standard formula or an internal model. Nevertheless, the scenario in which the insurance companies operate is often more complex than that one assumed by the standard formula. According to the standard formula the SCR is represented as the change in net asset value due to longevity shock which is a permanent 20 % reduction of mortality rates for all ages. A constant shock is not reasonable for all ages and maturities. The scenario related to the standard formula may lead to a biased allocation of capital, because of the volatility of longevity phenomenon in respect of different ages. In this paper we examine the adequacy of SCRs {{on the basis of the}} standard formula. To correctly calculate the solvency capital requirement we follow a multi-period approach in the sense that we evaluate at the beginning of each year the amount of capital that the insurer need to meet its future obligations year by year till the contract will be in force. We examine the adequacy of the shocks structure suggested by the standard formula studying its impact on the SCR for longevity risk (SCRLong) and liabilities at different ages...|$|R

40|$|Longevity risk {{is one of}} the {{remaining}} frontiers challenging modern financial markets and financial engineering. Financial innovation has yet to successfully master this very significant risk facing many countries internationally. For well over a hundred years this risk has been the domain of <b>life</b> insurance companies, <b>reinsurance</b> companies and actuaries. The aging population around the world drives the need for new products for managing longevity risk and new markets for hedging this risk.

Three new variables, say new business, lines of business and group status are created in this study to test for their impact on life insurers demand for reinsurance.

Tests are performed using data from all the 291 operating UK life insurers for the time period from 1995 to 2007. The data for 2005 to 2007 include information on intra-group reinsurance and external reinsurance. The results for this study indicate that new business has a significant effect on <b>life</b> insurers <b>reinsurance</b> demand, and for life insurers with a large proportion of with-profit insurance business and belonging to a group, their demand for reinsurance, especially intra-group reinsurance is stronger than others.

U. S. life insurance and annuity liabilities ceded to shadow reinsurers grew from $ 11 billion in 2002 to $ 364 billion in 2012. Life insurers using shadow insurance, which capture half of the market share, ceded 25 cents of every dollar insured to shadow reinsurers in 2012, up from 2 cents in 2002. By relaxing capital requirements, shadow insurance could reduce the marginal cost of issuing policies and thereby improve retail market efficiency. However, shadow insurance could also reduce risk-based capital and increase expected loss for the industry.

40|$|Recently, {{a marked}} Poisson process (MPP) model for life {{catastrophe}} risk was proposed in [6]. We provide a justification and further {{support for the}} model by considering more general Poisson point processes {{in the context of}} extreme value theory (EVT), and basing the choice of model on statistical tests and model comparisons. A case study examining accidental deaths in the Finnish population is provided. We further extend the applicability of the catastrophe risk model by considering small and big accidents separately; the resulting combined MPP model can flexibly capture the whole range of accidental death counts. Using the proposed model, we present a simulation framework for pricing (<b>life)</b> catastrophe <b>reinsurance,</b> based on modeling the underlying policies at individual contract level. The accidents are first simulated at population level, and their effect on a specific insurance company is then determined by explicitly simulating the resulting insured deaths. The proposed microsimulation approach can potentially lead to more accurate results than the traditional methods, and to a better view of risk, as it can make use of all the information available to the re/insurer and can explicitly accommodate even complex re/insurance terms and product features. As an example we price several excess reinsurance contracts. The proposed simulation model is also suitable for solvency assessment. Comment: 32 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

It provides a brief overview of the insurance industry and reviews the risks it faces, as well as several recent failures of insurance companies that had systemic implications. Assimilation of banking-type activities by life insurers appears to be the key systemic vulnerability.
