Standard SANS 1473 - 1 stipulates three categories of assemblies i. e. type-tested, partially type-tested and specially tested assemblies. The specially tested assembly is unique to the South African market, while the other two categories are stipulated in standard SANS IEC 60439 - 1 (<b>Low</b> <b>Voltage</b> <b>Switchgear</b> and Controlgear Assemblies: Part 1 : Type-tested and partially type-tested assemblies), which is internationally accepted in many countries as the applicable low-voltage assembly standard. Standard SANS 1473 - 1 specifies seven type-tests for certification as a type-tested assembly (TTA), but specifies, at most, three type-tests for certification as a specially tested assembly (STA). The underlying purpose of a technical standard is to provide for the safety of people and property, with the purpose of the research being twofold: 1. To investigate if the testing requirements specified for a specially tested assembly (STA), in accordance with standard SANS 1473 - 1, are correctly applied, and do not pose any safety risks. 2. To investigate any safety risks that stem from the fact that four type-tests are excluded for verification as a specially tested assembly (STA), as opposed to the seven type tests required for verification as a type-tested assembly (TTA).

In view of the low-voltage switchgear with high reliability and relatively large number of samples, a feasible compatibility test method is proposed. Firstly, the distribution type can be tested through engineering experience and Goodness of fit test for weibull distribution. Then a prior information compatibility test is carried out by Wilcoxon rank sum test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov nonparametric test method. Finally, the prior information which is incompatible with credible site information is removed and reliable prior information is obtained.

40|$|Load break {{switches}} (LBSs) {{are common}} inside {{metal clad switchgear}} assemblies where space is a limiting factor. SF 6 is usually used in this application due to its superior electrical characteristics, but is unfortunately also a strong greenhouse gas. Therefore development of new products, utilizing air which is an environmental friendly alternative, is in progress. Since air has much lower dielectric strength than SF 6, the main challenge with this is therefore to reduce the size. Compact SF 6 products have created a retrofit market, and in many existing installation sites larger products will not fit. Current interruption is a complex process and depends on several parameters, {{and it is not}} straight forward to optimize the design of a medium voltage (MV) switch. Numerical simulation which is a common for product development in other areas is difficult for this application. Due to the long dominance of SF 6 products, little research has been published about the design criteria for LBS technology in air. The scope of the thesis covers current interruption of MV LBSs in air with respect to various design parameters, such as nozzle geometry, nozzle materials, gas flow, and contact movement. Both gas blow-assisted current interruption (associated with puffer breakers) and ablation-assisted current interruption are addressed. The material in the nozzle can enhance the interruption capability. Such a nozzle material is called ablation material. When the arc is burning close to the surface of an ablation material, gas is evaporated which cools the arc. This technology is used to some extent for <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>switchgear,</b> but much less for higher voltages. The objective is therefore to investigate the potential of this technology for the MV LBS application. All work is done experimentally with similar test conditions as are used for product type testing. A direct powered MV laboratory and a test switch are built. The test switch is designed particularly for parameter studies. The result from air blow experiments reveal the minimum upstream pressure drop required for current interruption for various basic nozzle geometries, and at different contact positions. One study is particular relevant for the 24 kV / 630 A class, and it is found that 0. 25 - 0. 3 bar upstream pressure drop appears to be a threshold value for successful interruption. It is also presented how the minimum upstream pressure drop varies for different MV LBS ratings. The results show that the needed pressure drop is approximately proportional, both towards the current and towards the rate of rise of recovery voltage. This investigation is made so that the majority of all MV LBS ratings (7 - 52 kV and up to 900 A) are covered. From the ablation experiments it was found that high content of hydrogen in the ablation material is favorable for enhancing the current interruption capability. In a comparison experiment between different polymers, polypropylene shows best interruption capability. This material was therefor applied as ablation material in the test switch, and tested in the MV laboratory. The results reveal high capability to interrupt the thermal phase (over the needs for most MV LBSs), but also that the transient recovery voltage several milliseconds after current zero often leads to dielectric re-ignition. This is opposite to a puffer breaker where the thermal interruption instead appears to be the crucial part. PhD i elkraftteknikkPhD in Electric Power Engineerin...|$|E
