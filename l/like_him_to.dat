5|$|Batwoman is a superheroine {{appearing}} in American comic books published by DC Comics. In all incarnations, {{the character is}} a wealthy heiress who becomes inspired by the superhero Batman and chooses, <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> <b>to</b> put her wealth and resources towards a war on crime as a masked vigilante in her home of Gotham City. The identity of Batwoman is shared by two heroines in mainstream DC publications; both women are named Katherine Kane, with the original Batwoman commonly referred to by her nickname Kathy and the modern incarnation going by the name Kate.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Tracy {{begins to}} {{question}} the reason why his sons want to {{spend so much time}} with him. One day, Tracy sees a special about Lyle and Erik Menendez—the two brothers who became famous for killing their parents—which leads him to believe that his sons are plotting to kill him. As a result, Tracy buys a life-Japanese sex doll that looks <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> use as a decoy to fool them. Eventually, Tracy realizes that he overreacted with his sons but warns his son, Tracy Jr. (Bobb'e J. Thompson), that if he were to die, that he and his brother will face jail time.|$|E
5|$|Peter, Joe, Cleveland, and Quagmire win {{a costume}} contest as {{characters}} from The A-Team (because {{they had an}} actual black guy as B. A. Baracus and the other team had a Jewish man for the same role). The four men find Brian, {{who is writing a}} report for the local newspaper. When Peter and his friends win the costume contest, Brian writes a report about it, and is later telephoned by a member of The New Yorker, who tell him they would <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> work for their magazine. Brian is initially given a warm welcome by the staff, but he is immediately fired after he informs them he never graduated from college. Meanwhile, disappointed at no longer being able to be The A-Team, Peter decides to become an unofficial A-Team alongside Joe, Cleveland, and Quagmire, and decide to help their local community. Peter designs a replica of the van used by The A-Team.|$|E

5|$|He also {{missed the}} {{opportunity}} to lead the original Sinister Six because he felt that joining the group would mean admitting he needed the help of others to rid himself of Spider-Man. Although he later formed the 'Sinister Twelve' when Spider-Man sent him to prison, he expressed anger at Mac Gargan for acquiring the Venom symbiote rather than using the new Scorpion suit provided for him simply because Gargan was not doing what he wanted, despite Venom being {{more powerful than the}} Scorpion. When he participated in the mystical ritual known as the Gathering of Five, he appeared convinced that he would automatically receive the gift of power from the ritual– which would bestow upon the participants power, immortality, knowledge, madness and death, respectively– only to receive the gift of madness instead, subsequently requiring an elaborate cocktail of drugs to restore himself to a semblance of sanity. During his time in charge of H.A.M.M.E.R. he was provoked into attacking Asgard by his Goblin side because his ego couldn't allow himself to consider the possibility that the Asgardians wouldn't threaten his power. Later events revealed that Loki at least slightly influenced Osborn's decision to further Loki's own goals. During his attempted takeover of Earth's superhuman security defenses, he was shown reflecting that humans are all barbarians who require the strong <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> control them, dismissing the Avengers as no better than him despite the obvious distinction between Osborn's demands for power and the straightforward respect that the general public have for the Avengers.|$|E
25|$|However, {{whether this}} is {{evidence}} of trade, diplomacy or military activity {{is a matter of}} controversy. It is possible that the Romans may have given support to Túathal, or someone <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> <b>to</b> regain his throne in the interests of having a friendly neighbour who could restrain Irish raiding.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, Nakagawa {{made his}} first trip to the United States where he met Nyogen Senzaki in San Francisco. He found Senzaki's {{approach}} to Zen refreshing, and was happy to find a new freedom in expressing himself to followers that would be unheard of in Japan. Free to combine his love for Japanese theater (Noh) into analogies that paralleled sayings of the great Zen masters of the past. Nyogen expressed his wish to Soen that he would <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> stay with him to become his heir, but Soen has responsibilities back at Ryutaku-ji he was unwilling to compromise. The two saw each other again in latter visits to the USA. During this year, Soen also published his Meihen (Life Anthology).|$|E

500|$|The war {{correspondent}} Pyotr Molchanov, who had frequently met Shanina at the front, {{described her}} as a person of unusual will with a genuine, bright nature. Shanina described herself as [...] "boundlessly and recklessly talky" [...] during her college years. She typified her own character as {{like that of the}} Romantic poet, painter and writer Mikhail Lermontov, deciding, <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> <b>to</b> act as she saw fit. Shanina dressed modestly and liked to play volleyball. According to Shanina's sister-in-arms Lidiya Vdovina, Roza used to sing her favourite war song [...] "Oy tumany moi, rastumany" [...] ("O My Mists") each time she cleaned her weapon. Shanina had a straightforward character and valued courage and the absence of egotism in people. She once told a story when [...] "about half a hundred frenzied fascists with wild cries" [...] attacked a trench accommodating twelve female snipers, including Shanina: [...] "Some fell from our well-aimed bullets, some we finished with our bayonets, grenades, shovels, and some we took prisoners, having restrained their arms." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2009, it was {{announced}} that actress Julianne Moore would guest star on 30 Rock as a love interest for Alec Baldwin's character, Jack Donaghy. Moore would later guest star in the episodes [...] "Winter Madness", [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter", [...] "Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land", and [...] "I Do Do". In an interview with USA Today in October 2009, Fey said that Jack would find more enduring love in the upcoming season. [...] "As we move into the back half of the season, we'd like to get [...] into a real adult relationship with some hurdles." [...] In the same interview, Baldwin noted, [...] "Fifty-year-old Jack running around still using women like a drug is not where I'd <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> end up." [...] Actor Larry Wilcox made a cameo in this episode, though, he was in character playing Officer Jon Baker from his old days in the drama show CHiPs, as Liz Lemon had a teen crush on Wilcox. In one scene of this episode, Liz says [...] "shark farts", and when asked about it in an April 2010 interview, Fey revealed that the term [...] "was one that we ad-libbed that we ended up leaving in. The studio asked us not to leave it in, but we left it in." ...|$|E

500|$|One night, Mr. Nutt is fatally {{attacked}} by a creature. The agents eventually discover that the attacker is Lanny's twin, Leonard, {{who is able to}} detach himself from Lanny's body. According to Lanny, Leonard attacks people and attempts to burrow into them because he is looking for a new brother to replace Lanny, who is dying from liver failure due to years of alcohol abuse. Lanny voluntarily locks himself in the local jail {{in an effort to keep}} Leonard from escaping, but dies during the night, and Leonard is able to slip through the bars on the cell window and flee. Mulder and Scully try to capture Leonard, who goes inside a funhouse, but he manages to get away. Upon leaving the funhouse, they find The Conundrum lying on the ground, rubbing his stomach, apparently having eaten Leonard. As Dr. Blockhead prepares to leave town with The Conundrum the following morning, he comments to Scully that with modern science eradicating genetic anomalies, it will be up to self-made freaks <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> remind people that [...] "nature abhors normality." [...] The Conundrum looks unwell and Mulder asks what the matter is. The Conundrum [...] in his only line of the episode [...] replies, [...] "probably something I ate." [...] As Dr. Blockhead drives away with The Conundrum, Mulder and Scully turn to each other with confused and somewhat shocked expressions.|$|E

[...] "I'd <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> join the polygraph list {{like the rest of us}} did. If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to worry about." [...] Geloo in response repeated that Roldan had answered all questions he was asked during the original investigation and was innocent of any crime that may have been committed.|$|E
2500|$|Hedrick caused {{controversy}} when {{he insisted}} Shani Davis, fellow American speed skater in the 1,000m race, should {{have participated in}} the men's pursuit, stating, [...] "I don't see what his logic is. We can't be beat if he skates. It's his decision. I'm not going to get in the middle of it. I would <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be in the pursuit, but am I going to beg him? No." [...] Five-time gold medalist and Olympic-team physician, Eric Heiden, has publicly written that Davis made the right choice in not participating in the team pursuit and thereby not jeopardizing his chances at a gold medal in his best event, the 1,000 meter race. Davis eventually won the gold medal in the 1000 m race, while Hedrick finished sixth.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} and second of his Quatre Sermons, Calvin also {{discouraged}} believers in Christ from simulating religious acts that are not worship of the true God in order to avoid persecution. [...] He argued that the growth of the Christian church was based on the “seeds sown” by those who were willing to die, if necessary, rather than worship or appear to worship false gods and that without such people there would never have been a Christian church. [...] He said that if one makes choices to suffer nothing for God’s word, one changes Jesus Christ to his own image: “Is that not to want to transform Jesus Christ to have him just as our flesh would <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be?” [...] Pierre Viret, a Swiss Reformed theologian and contemporary of John Calvin, made similar arguments.|$|E
2500|$|On Saturday, February 11, {{the lineup}} for Team USA was announced. Hedrick would skate with Mull and Leveille for the {{preliminary}} races, reserving veteran Olympians Boutiette and Parra for the finals. Within hours, articles denouncing Davis {{as a poor}} teammate, unpatriotic and selfish were posted on the Internet, hitting the newspapers the next day leaving Davis having to defend himself and make up excuses for not skating an event he was never eligible to skate {{in the first place}} while U.S. Speedskating remained silent. Much of the criticism towards Davis was from Hedrick himself. Two days before the official announcement, Hedrick stated, [...] "I don't see what his logic is. We can't be beat if he skates. It's his decision. I'm not going to get in the middle of it. I would <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be in the pursuit, but am I going to beg him? No." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dennis Ross {{said in an}} {{interview}} on The Situation Room on CNN that Carter's interpretation of the maps in Palestine Peace Not Apartheid is [...] "just simply wrong." [...] Whereas in his book Carter presents the maps as an [...] "Israeli interpretation of the Clinton idea," [...] according to Ross, who {{played a key role in}} shaping the Clinton administration's efforts to bring peace to the region, the maps in fact represented Clinton's proposals exactly. Responding to a question posed by CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, Ross stated that Carter was also [...] "wrong" [...] to suggest that Israel had rejected the American proposals at Camp David: [...] "his is a matter of record. This is not a matter of interpretation." [...] Ross concluded: [...] "President Carter made a major contribution to peace in the Middle East. That's the reality. I would <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> meet the same standard that he applied then to what he's doing now." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{critics argue}} that the Fair Youth {{sequence}} follows a story-line told by Shakespeare. Evidence that corroborates {{this is that the}} sonnets show a constant change of attitude that would seem to follow a day-by-day private journal entry. [...] Furthermore, there is an argument that the Fair Youth sequence was written to Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton. [...] Critics believe that Shakespeare would <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> marry and have an heir so that his beauty would live forever. The historical timeline of the procreation sonnets directly relates to William Cecil Lord Burghley and the pressure he put on Southamptom to marry his granddaughter Lady Elizabeth Vere (daughter of Edward de Vere). To this day the relationship between Henry Wriothesly and Shakespeare is debated {{due to the fact that}} some believe it was romantic in nature, and not platonic. Regardless most critics agree that Shakespeare wrote this sonnet in order to convince him to produce an heir.|$|E
2500|$|One day, Jonathan met two gulls {{who took}} him to a [...] "higher plane of existence" [...] in which there was no heaven but a better world found through {{perfection}} of knowledge. There he meets another seagull who loves to fly. He discovers that his sheer tenacity and desire to learn make him [...] "pretty well a one-in-a-million bird." [...] In this new place, Jonathan befriends the wisest gull, Chiang, who takes him beyond his previous learning, teaching him how to move instantaneously to anywhere else in the Universe. The secret, Chiang says, is to [...] "begin by knowing that you have already arrived." [...] Not satisfied with his new life, Jonathan returns to Earth to find others <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> <b>to</b> bring them his learning and to spread his love for flight. His mission is successful, gathering around him others who have been outlawed for not conforming. Ultimately, the very first of his students, Fletcher Lynd Seagull, becomes a teacher in his own right, and Jonathan leaves to teach other flocks.|$|E
2500|$|With the Peloponnesian War, {{increasing}} {{military expenditures}} began {{to undermine the}} liturgical system of public finance. [...] The need for trierarchs was greater than ever, [...] but the rich were increasingly {{trying to avoid the}} obligation. For the first time, the idea became current that personal wealth is not primarily intended to serve the city, but one's own good, even though expressed [...] "discreetly, insensibly, without the rich admitting it openly". Thus, in 415 BC., the wealthy supporters of Nicias, opposed <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the expedition to Sicily, preferred not to intervene, [...] rather than risk the impression of worrying more about their own interests than those of the city. By 411 BC., the wealthy were less hesitant to defend their private interests, when they set up the oligarchy of the Four Hundred. In 405 BC, [...] one of the characters in The Frogs remarks that [...] "you can no longer find a rich man to be trierarch: each puts on rags and goes about whining 'I am needy!'" ...|$|E
