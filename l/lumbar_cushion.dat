50|$|The lumbar is {{the region}} of the spine between the {{diaphragm}} and the pelvis; it supports the most weight and is the most flexible. The adjustable lumbar mechanisms in seats allow the user to change the seat back shape in this region, to make it more comfortable and include adjustable <b>lumbar</b> <b>cushion.</b> Some seats are long enough to support full thigh and follow back curves.|$|E
50|$|Automobile {{accessibility}} also {{refers to}} {{ease of use}} by disabled people. Automobiles, whether a car or a van, can be adapted {{for a range of}} physical disabilities. Foot pedals can be raised, or replaced with hand-controlled devices. Wheelchair hoists, lifts or ramps may be customized according {{to the needs of the}} driver. Ergonomic adaptations, such as a <b>lumbar</b> support <b>cushion,</b> may also be needed.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe City Automated Transport System (CATS) was a {{collaborative}} FP 7 European project that lasted from 2010 to 2014. Its {{objective was to}} evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of driverless electric vehicles in European cities. This contribution explains how the project was implemented by 11 teams in five countries, culminating with practical trials of driverless vehicles in Strasbourg, France; Ploiesti, Romania; and Lausanne, Switzerland. The Navya vehicles used were able to transport up to eight passengers, in an open vehicle where passengers could recline against <b>lumbar</b> support <b>cushions.</b> After extensive road testing in Strasbourg, the final demonstration {{took place at the}} EPFL campus in Lausanne, where around 1600 people were transported safely during 16 days of vehicle operation. Three vehicles were used, a fourth remaining on campus as a backup. Although no driver was present, a student was available on board of each vehicle to respond to questions from the passengers and to handle the three points on the 1. 8 km route where there was insufficient leeway for two vehicles to pass each other. Passenger reactions to the driverless vehicle concept were collected by questionnaire and were overwhelmingly positive. Caveats include limited access for people with disabilities and the risk that a regular service based on this new concept might compete with walking and cycling rather than with transport by car. Implications for the acceptability of driverless electric vehicles in Europe and elsewhere are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Proper seating is {{essential}} to prevent spinal curvatures. Severe scoliosis is common in DMD and can interfere with sitting, sleeping, and breathing. A wheelchair that is fitted appropriately accounts for frame size, type of seat, <b>lumbar</b> support and <b>cushioning</b> to avoid pressure ulcers. It should be equipped with other mechanical devices, such as tilt ability, {{in order to provide}} comfort and to protect the skin. Power wheelchairs are indicated for most clients who can no longer ambulate, as they do not have enough upper extremity strength to propel a manual wheelchair independently. DMD affects many people in their adolescence, so it is crucial for rehab therapists to be conscious that significant development may occur during this time. Without proper seating and postural support throughout development, deformation may occur. This could then result in dysfunctional positioning. It is important for rehab therapists to re-evaluate the fit of an individual’s wheelchair as often as every year during adolescence.|$|R
40|$|To prevent {{low back}} pain and sitting {{discomfort}} in prolonged sitting, inflatable <b>lumbar</b> support <b>cushion,</b> in which, air is supplied with a linear compressor and pressure is controlled with a E/P regulator, has been developed to provide lumbar lordotic continuous passive motion(CPM). Currently, we developed dual CPM device, in which additional CPM cushion was located in the anterior portion of the seat. Effects of these devices in prolonged sitting were determined. A total of 23 male volunteers without {{low back pain}} was recruited. The dual CPM has synchronized two bladders with reciprocal motion in the opposite phase: When one bladder inflates the other deflates. Subjects {{sat in a chair}} for a two-h period on each of four consecutive days under four randomized test modalities: 1, no lumbar support; 2, static lumbar support; 3, lumbar support CPM; and 4,dual CPM. The CPM cycle rate was set at 60 seconds inflation and 60 seconds deflation. Each subject selected an optimal maximum bladder pressure through trial and error. Finally, each subject indicated lumbar discomfort, stiffness, fatigue, and buttock numbness on 10 -cm visual analog scales(VAS). The mean VAS scores from the 4 periods were compared with paired T tests. It was 8. 2 ± 1. 6 without lumbar support, 5. 9 ± 1. 9 with the fixed support, and 5. 7 ± 2. 3 with lumbar support CPM. There was no statistical significant difference between the fixed support and lumbar support CPM. Compared to the lumbar support CPM, significant improvement was obtained with the dual CPM device(p< 0. 05). The benefits of lumbar support CPM over static lumbar support are limited. The effect of dual CPM can be explained by anterior rotation of the pelvis. The dual CPM may provide a comprehensive solution for occupational disability due to sitting intolerance...|$|R
