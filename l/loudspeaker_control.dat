However previous studies highlighted {{the importance of}} the <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>control</b> in current. These studies have been done only with large size loudspeakers (bass or midrange loudspeakers) and this is certainly not transposable for the type of loudspeaker in interest i. e. micro-speaker. First of all, this paper describes a model of loudspeaker (voltage driven and also current driven) represented by a comprehensive set of data based on a minimal number of measurements. Simu-lation results based on these models are presented using single frequency signals such as multi-frequencies signals to compare the two driven methods. At this level of modelling, simulation results show that, contrary to the woofer applica-tions, current driving of micro-speaker does not affect significantly in terms of harmonic distortions, intermodulation distortions and transient behaviour...|$|E
40|$|The {{networking}} and digitalization of audio equipment {{has created a}} need for control protocols. These protocols offer new services to customers and ensure that the equipment operates correctly. The control protocols used in the computer networks are not directly applicable since embedded systems have resource and cost limitations. In this master's thesis the design and implementation of new <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>control</b> network protocols are presented. The protocol stack was required to be reliable, have short response times, configure the network automatically and support the dynamic addition and removal of loudspeakers. The implemented protocol stack was also required to be as efficient and lightweight as possible because the network nodes are fairly simple and lack processing power. The protocol stack was thoroughly tested, validated and verified. The protocols were formally described using LOTOS (Language of Temporal Ordering Specifications) and verified using reachability analysis. A prototype of the loudspeaker network was built and used for testing the operation {{and the performance of}} the control protocols. The implemented control protocol stack met the design specifications and proved to be highly reliable and efficient...|$|E

The physical and geometrical characteristics of the system studied have been chosen {{similar to those of}} the fuselage of a civil aircraft. The total sound power transmitted by the double panel system has been used to evaluate the active control performance considering three different configurations for the control system: first, active mounts connecting the two panels driven to cancel the out-of-plane velocities at the connecting points on the radiating panel; second, loudspeakers placed between the two panels driven to cancel the acoustic pressure at specific points near to each <b>control</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> and third, simultaneous use of the active mounts and <b>control</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> systems. Also, the performance of the three control devices have been evaluated when total sound power radiation is minimised. The simulations carried out have shown that the <b>control</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> are able to produce large attenuation of the sound transmission at frequencies close to the mass-air-mass resonance of the double panel.

40|$|Active {{noise control}} is a topic of {{increasing}} interest for car manufacturers. In the lower fre-quency range, active control could relax the need for sound insulating materials, leading to lighter vehicles with lower fuel consumption. Here, we investigate further {{the possibility of using}} multiple loudspeakers with the aim of enlarging the spatial zones where sufficient noise suppression is achieved. A model-based Linear Quadratic design of a linear multiple-output feedforward regulator is used to approximate known noise paths to multiple measurement po-sitions by the combined secondary paths from the <b>control</b> <b>loudspeakers.</b> The attainable perfor-mance depends on the number and positioning of the <b>control</b> <b>loudspeakers.</b> Tools are needed for predicting and understanding the structural constraints on the attainable performance of the active control system.

We evaluated the usability of two hand-held interfaces; an acceleration-sensitive Gyromouse and the User Interface Wand (UI Wand), a new prototype pointing device. The evaluation consisted of a quantitative evaluation in a laboratory setting and a qualitative evaluation using a simulated clinical setting. A quantitative tapping task was performed on a computer screen using target objects of different sizes and positioned at different distances, resulting in a set of indices of difficulties (ID's) based on Fitts' Law. The qualitative task was performed in the simulated clinical setting where images and patient data were viewed and manipulated, and a printer and two <b>loudspeakers</b> <b>controlled.</b> In the quantitative evaluation, the Gyromouse showed to be 25 +/- 3 % (mean+/-SD, n = 11, p 2. 5 bits and equally fast for ID's < 2. 5 bits.

25|$|The {{interaction}} of a loudspeaker system with its environment {{is complex and}} is largely out of the <b>loudspeaker</b> designer's <b>control.</b> Most listening rooms present {{a more or less}} reflective environment, depending on size, shape, volume, and furnishings. This means the sound reaching a listener's ears consists not only of sound directly from the speaker system, but also the same sound delayed by traveling to and from (and being modified by) one or more surfaces. These reflected sound waves, when added to the direct sound, cause cancellation and addition at assorted frequencies (e.g., from resonant room modes), thus changing the timbre and character of the sound at the listener's ears. The human brain is very sensitive to small variations, including some of these, and {{this is part of the}} reason why a loudspeaker system sounds different at different listening positions or in different rooms.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the theory and}} implementation of a system for the active control of acoustic noise in a small enclosure ("small" inferring {{that only a small}} number of acoustic modes dominate the reverberant field in the en c 1 osure). The theory for a multichannel active noise control system is developed. A system could consist of a number of detectors and cancellation sources controlling the field at a number of monitor positions. The simplest system comprises a single detector and a single source and is capable of controlling the field at one position. The controller for this system could consist of a pair of electronic filters, one between the detector and the source in parallel with another cancelling the feedback from the source to the detector. It is shown that for any configuration of transducers the required controllers can be realised by repeatedly using the same filter pair as described above. A particular study is made of the active control of reverberant fields. A system was successfully implemented to partially control the reverberant field in a small enclosure (0 - 5 x 0 - 6 x 0. 7 m). This consisted of a single detector microphone and a single <b>control</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>controlling</b> the field at a single monitor microphone. The system was controlled with two finite impulse response filters realised using a Texas Instruments TMS 32020 microprocessor accessed via a Ferranti PC 360 XT personal computer. The first two modes of the reverberant field were successfully attenuated. In summary, the theory for a multichannel controller has been developed and the simplist case tested. The importance of this is that the basic unit of a multichannel controller has been successfully implemented and this unit could be replicated as the basic building block for more complex controllers. This facilitates the implementation of controllers to attenuate the sound field at a number of points in a practical enclosure. <p...|$|R

40|$|Active {{noise control}} systems offer a {{potential}} method {{of reducing the}} weight of passive acoustic treatment and, therefore, increasing vehicles’ fuel efficiency. The widespread commercialisation of active noise control has, however, not been achieved {{partly due to the}} cost of implementation. The active control of engine noise can be implemented cost-effectively by using the car audio <b>loudspeakers</b> as <b>control</b> sources and an array of low-cost microphones as error sensors. Such systems have been practically demonstrated, but without also controlling road noise their subjective benefits may be somewhat limited. The active control of road noise using the car audio loudspeakers and a feedforward control strategy has also been practically demonstrated. However, these systems require a number of accelerometers to be mounted to the vehicle’s structure to obtain a coherent reference signal and, therefore, lead to a significant implementation cost. To achieve cost-effective control of road noise, two feedback control strategies are investigated which employ the array of microphones and the car audio loudspeakers common to a feedforward engine noise control system. The first proposed system weights the contributions from the error microphones and the loudspeakers to increase the magnitude of the open-loop response over the bandwidth where noise attenuation is required, as in modal feedback control. This spatial filtering technique is combined with temporal filtering to further enhance the magnitude of the open-loop response over the targeted bandwidth and to compensate for the phase response of the <b>control</b> <b>loudspeakers.</b> The application of this control system is limited to applications where a specific acoustic mode requires control. Therefore, a second, multichannel feedback control system is also presented. This system may achieve broadband control of road noise at the expense of controller complexity...|$|R
