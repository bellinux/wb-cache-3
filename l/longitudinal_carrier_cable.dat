40|$|Convergence of {{information}} industries {{has led to}} the emergence of services that cross industry boundaries. Changes in these industries have caused the organization of regulatory institutions to become inadequate. An exploratory analysis of orders issued by bureaus of the US Federal Communications Commission shows overlap in the issues on which each provides rulings. Rather than organizing into traditional industries such as common <b>carrier,</b> <b>cable,</b> and mass media, bureaus could be re-organized into functions such as oversight of rates, spectrum allocation, and universal service provision. Using theories of bureaucracy and organization, this paper proposes an explanation for the difficulties that the FCC has had in adapting to converging information industries.

40|$|Carrier {{dynamics}} {{acquire a}} new {{character in the}} presence of Bloch-band Berry curvature, which naturally arises in gapped Dirac materials (GDMs). Here we argue that photoresponse in GDMs with small band gaps is dramatically enhanced by Berry curvature. This manifests in a giant and saturable Hall photoconductivity when illuminated by circularly polarized light. Unlike Hall motion arising from a Lorentz force in a magnetic field, which impedes <b>longitudinal</b> <b>carrier</b> motion, Hall photoconductivity arising from Berry curvature can boost <b>longitudinal</b> <b>carrier</b> transport. In GDMs, this results in a helicity-dependent photoresponse in the Hall regime, where photoconductivity is dominated by its Hall component. We find that the induced Hall conductivity per incident irradiance is enhanced by up to six orders of magnitude when moving from the visible regime (with corresponding band gaps) to the far infrared. These results suggest that narrow-gap GDMs are an ideal test-bed for the unique physics that arise {{in the presence of}} Berry curvature, and open a new avenue for infrared and terahertz optoelectronics...|$|R
