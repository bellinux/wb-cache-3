40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{the first in}} depth study of formal and informal labour markets in Georgia, based on the analysis of labour force and household survey data for 1998, 1999. A conceptual framework is developed, which distinguishes informal activities from other types of untaxed, unregulated and/or unmeasured activities (illegal, underground and household activities). Despite a massive collapse in output, following the dismantlement of the former Soviet Union, open unemployment increased relatively little in Georgia. This thesis suggests that this was, in part, due to a transfer of labour into informal employment. The results show that by 1999, 52 % of total (34 % of non-agricultural) employment was informal. It argues that the resulting fiscal crisis squeezed social security provision and individuals {{could not afford to}} be unemployed. It also shows that there was little growth in private firms capable of absorbing <b>labour</b> <b>shed</b> from the state sector. With limited formal job creation and no adequate social benefits, labour shifted mainly into informal employment. The analysis shows that informal activities provide a social safety net. Informal employment is found to increase the risk of poverty with respect to formal employment and to lower it with respect to unemployment and inactivity ceteris paribus. Assuming that individuals are utility maximizing and that they make rational choices, this thesis concludes that, on average, individuals work informally because there is no formal alternative and because they are better off than being unemployed or inactive. However, the informal sector is also found to be contributing to deskilling the labour force, further marginalizing certain vulnerable groups, and its concentration amongst ethnic minorities and underprivileged regions could contribute to undermining Georgia's stability. The challenge for policy will be how to benefit from the informal sector's capacity to provide a social safety net, while minimizing its potentially detrimental consequences...|$|R

How can such labour markets {{cope with the}} consequences of the Great Recession? Larger <b>labour</b> <b>shedding</b> is to be expected and this strains the social safety net and increases the demands on active labour market policies. This paper takes {{a closer look at the}} labour market consequences of the crisis for Denmark. It is found that employment adjustment is not particularly large in international comparison, although it has more weight on the extensive (number of employees) than the intensive (hours) margin. The level of job creation remains high, although job creation is pro-cyclical and job-separation counter-cyclical. As a consequence most unemployment spells remain short. This is critical since a persistent increase in unemployment will affect the financial balance of the model severely. Comparative evidence does not, however, indicate that flexicurity markets are more prone to persistence. Crucial for this is the design of the social safety net and in particular the active labour market policy. However, the larger inflow into activation raises questions concerning the possibility of maintaining the efficiency of the system. flexicurity, employment protection, unemployment insurance, active labour market policy...|$|E
40|$|Politicians {{and farm}} lobbyists {{frequently}} use {{the argument that}} agricultural policy is necessary to safeguard jobs in agriculture. We explore whether this is true by conducting an econometric ex-post evaluation of the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the three East German States Brandenburg, Saxony, and Saxony-Anhalt. Whereas previous studies have employed descriptive statistics or qualitative methods and have looked at single policy instruments in isolation, we apply a difference-in-differences estimator to analyse the employment effects of the entire portfolio of CAP measures simultaneously. Based on panel data at the county level, we find that investment aids and transfers to less favoured areas had a zero marginal employment effect. We present evidence that full decoupling of direct payments in 2005 led to <b>labour</b> <b>shedding,</b> as it made transfer payments independent of factor allocation. Spending on modern technologies in processing and marketing and measures aimed at the development of rural areas led to job losses in agriculture. Agri-environmental measures, on the other hand, kept labour intensive technologies in production or induced them. This analysis calls into question whether an expansion of existing second pillar measures is a reasonable way to use funds modulated away from the first pillar.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which the policies towards the welfare state pursued by the Labour Government in its first fifteen months represent a break with those of its Conservative predecessor and with earlier policies put forward by Labour in opposition. Four key parts of its inheritance from the Conservatives are identified: attempts to control public spending; privatisation (more in terms of welfare provision than of its financing); the growth of means-testing; and the growth of inequality. The paper summarises the main policy developments towards the welfare state since May 1997, and identifies four linking themes: the importance to <b>Labour</b> of <b>shedding</b> its “tax and spend” image leading to tight budget constraints, but with significant reallocation towards health and education; a strong focus on the promotion of paid work; a series of measures intended to reduce inequality and relative poverty, but with controversy over benefit levels; and the new dominance of the Treasury in making welfare and social policy. Some of these policies mark clear reversals from those of the Conservatives, but in others they continue an evolution which was already underway, despite the earlier Labour rhetoric about “thinking the unthinkable” on welfare reform...|$|R

J.A. Smith argues that floating through the arguments of Blue Labour is the old philosophical idea of ‘the Good’: the ideal way of pursuing life that could bring everyone together. He sees a problem: [...] "...while ‘families, localities and communities … embedded in shared traditions, interests and faiths’ sounds like a fairly uncontroversial place to try to locate this, doing so immediately excludes the many people for whom family, or the place or faith of their upbringing, is very far from being such a transcendentally benevolent force in their lives.

40|$|Agricultural {{employment}} in South Africa's commercial farming sector is declining {{at an alarming}} rate. During the 11 year period from 1988 to 1998, for example, the commercial farm sector shed a staggering 140 000 regular jobs, a decline of roughly 20 %. Moreover, there is a trend away from employment of regular, permanent workers, and a simultaneous- though not commensurate- increase {{in the use of}} casual workers, meaning jobs of less security and consistency. If the decline in employment continues in this fashion, then the already grave problem of rural unemployment will become graver still. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the causes of this trend. On the face of it, South Africa is merely following the same trajectory mapped out by other medium and high-income countries practising predominantly land-extensive agriculture, whereby agricultural mechanisation and modernisation displace labour in response to relative changes in factor costs. However, processes in South Africa are arguably only superficially related to those in these other countries. The paper provides preliminary evidence from a survey of farm workers, as well as from a survey of institutions serving commercial farmers, that indeed the underlying logic that is driving <b>labour</b> <b>shedding</b> and casualisation in South Africa is different.

40|$|The {{transition}} in East Germany {{has been characterized}} by an extremely rapid privatization of state-owned enterprises and by an equally rapid process of deindustrialization. The great majority of East German SOEs have been privatized and are now genuine capitalist firms with an owner with the incentive {{and the power to}} change management behaviour. Meanwhile East Germany has been deindustrialized with employment in mining and manufacturing falling to one quarter of its pre-unification level. This paper argues that the government imposed an inconsistent policy toward employment on the privatization agency, the Treuhand. Although required to take account of the shadow price of labour in the privatization negotiations (where employment subsidies were offered to prospective purchasers), the Treuhand engaged in large-scale <b>labour</b> <b>shedding</b> prior to privatization (using the market wage). Although costly {{from the perspective of the}} economy as a whole, the Treuhand had little choice given its mandate to privatize rapidly. Finding buyers for Treuhand enterprises has required single-minded focus on the issue of corporate governance and the matching of assets to management capabilities through the policy of selling to `competent outsiders' diverted attention from the possibility that such a policy would not guarantee the retention of a minimal core of industrial activity. Late in the day, the Treuhand recognized that greater use had to be made of economies of scale in management and control to achieve the forward-looking restructuring of its remaining portfolio.

Not surprisingly, the results have been mixed. In South Africa all controls were effectively cut adrift, and {{the jury is still out}} on the results. A feature of the New Zealand experience has been the adoption of new technologies and even new farming sectors. Productivity showed a distinctive break at 1984, the year of the reforms; up to that date an average of 1. 5 percent, past that date an average of 2. 5 percent. A similar analysis of productivity in South Africa shows that increases seem to be the result of <b>labour</b> <b>shedding</b> only. The results do not bode well for South African agriculture.
