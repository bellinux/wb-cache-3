50|$|These {{developments}} alerted immunologists on the {{one hand}} and transplantation biologists on the other of the Mhc’s potential importance for their respective disciplines. The consequence was a proliferation of reports describing association of a variety of phenomena with the complex. The associations were demonstrated by testing the responses of congenic strains differing at the H2 complex and mapping the genes controlling the responses within the H2 complex with the help of strains carrying H2 haplotypes derived by intra-H2 recombinations. These strains were developed by George D. Snell, Jack H. Stimpfling, Donald C. Shreffler, and Jan Klein. The phenomena included control of antibody response to a variety of antigens, both natural and synthetic; suppression of immune response by special suppressor cells or soluble factors; proliferation of lymphocytes in an in vitro culture challenged with H2-incompatible stimulating cell (the so-called mixed lymphocyte reaction, MLR); killing of H2-icompatible target cells by sensitized lymphocytes (cell-mediated <b>lymphocytotoxicity,</b> CML); response of transplanted immune cell against the tissues of the host (graft versus host reaction, GVHR); rejection of H2-incompatible grafts (skin, heart, bone marrow, etc.) by the recipients; and others. All these phenomena appeared to be controlled by different loci within the Mhc. As a result, the H2 complex appeared to expand by the addition of new loci (regions). Klein’s group, however, challenged this interpretation and in a series of carefully controlled studies demonstrated that the new loci were in reality mirages generated by various forms of interaction involving the established class I and class II loci. In this manner, Klein contracted the H2 complex back to the version established by the serological methods, and propounded the view that the various responses (MLR, CML, etc.) were controlled by the class I and class II loci, rather than by separate loci. Later, other loci were again mapped within the H2 complex and these were no phantoms. They were real but, as Klein argued, they were unrelated to the class I and class II loci and ended up in the region by chance. The general opinion was, however, that they represented the class III region of the Mhc, that they were functionally related to the Mhc by being involved in immune response, and that the complex functioned as an immune supergene. The first of these class III loci was the Ss locus, which was later identified as coding for complement component 4. The C4 protein was indeed involved in immunity by being one in a series of protein molecules that attach to a cell-bound antibody to puncture a hole in it and thus kill it. But nobody could come up with a reason why it had to be linked to the class I or class II genes to function properly. Similar arguments could be applied to the other class III genes. Later, Klein’s view received a strong support when his group discovered that in the fishes, which comprise more than half of jawed vertebrates, not even the class I and class II genes were in a single cluster and the class III genes were scattered all over the genome. Ultimately, the modern concept prevailed against the tendencies to make the Mhc unnecessarily nonparsimonious.|$|E

Antibody-dependent cytolysis, <b>lymphocytotoxicity</b> and antibody-dependent cellular <b>lymphocytotoxicity</b> were assessed using viral adult rat cardiocytes as target cells. Muscle-specific anti-sarcolemmal antibodies of the anti-myolemmal type [...] {{often associated with}} non-organ-specific anti-endothelial antibodies [...] were demonstrated in nine out of 10 {{patients with}} coxsackie B, in all patients with influenza and mumps and in 65 out of 144 patients with undefined myocarditis. In contrast, 13 out of 15 patients with cytomegalovirus myocarditis lacked anti-sarcolemmal antibodies but had low titre anti-inter fibrillary antibodies instead. In the presence of complement, anti-myolemmal antibodies induced cytolysis of vital cardiocytes, whereas hepatocytes remained unaffected. Titres of anti-myolemmal antibodies correlated with the degree of cardiocytolysis. The anti-myolemmal immunofluorescent pattern and the cytolytic serum activity could be absorbed with the respective viral antigens suggesting that these antibodies cross-react with moieties of the virus itself and may be both diagnostic and aetiological markers in acute viral myocarditis.

40|$|Homogenized {{tissue from}} the frontal cortex of normal human brains {{obtained}} at postmortem examination {{was used to}} absorb lymphocytotoxic antibody from the serum of six patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Four absorptions {{of all of the}} SLE sera with equal volumes of homogenized brain tissue at 4 degrees C depleted their cytotoxic capacity more than 90 %. Three of the six sera, however, retained some <b>lymphocytotoxicity</b> despite extensive brain absorption. Absorbed lymphocytotoxic antibodies were eluted from brain tissue absorbents at 37 degrees C. Cytotoxicity of the brain eluates was blocked by antibodies to human IgM (mu-chain specific) but not anti-IgG. The unabsorbed SLE sera, brain-absorbed sera, and brain eluates were equally cytotoxic to T (thymus-derived) and B (bone marrow-derived) cells fractionated from normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Thus, the lymphocytotoxic antibodies in SLE serum exhibit no preference for circulating human T cells. An analysis of the clinical records of 40 patients with SLE whose serum cytotoxic capacity had been determined revealed that circulating <b>lymphocytotoxicity</b> is greater in sera of patients with central nervous system (CNS) manifestations than in other SLE patients.

40|$|Syngeneic and {{allogeneic}} target {{cells were}} killed in the presence of CBA mouse lymphocytes and viable Mycoplasma arthritidis. Medium supplementation had no effect on the response. Nonviable M. arthritidis was also capable of stimulating <b>lymphocytotoxicity,</b> although to a much lesser extent. Cytotoxicity was shown to be largely dependent upon the lymphocytes, since lymphocytes preincubated with mycoplasmas and treated to remove remaining organisms were highly toxic to target cells, whereas supernatants prepared from lymphocyte/mycoplasma mixtures exhibited minimal effects. A 6 -h exposure of lymphocytes to mycoplasmas at a ratio of 100 : 1 was sufficient for commitment to target cell killing. Functional lymphocytes were required for the reaction, since gamma-irradiated lymphocytes did not develop cytotoxic potential {{despite the fact that the}} mycoplasmas replicated equally well in the presence of these and untreated lymphocytes. Furthermore, lymphocytes already activated with mycoplasmas lost cytotoxic potential after disruption. The kinetics and degree of <b>lymphocytotoxicity</b> induced by M. arthritidis and phytohemagglutinin toward 51 Cr-labeled syngeneic fibroblasts were similar. Removal of most B cells and other adherent cells by column separation did not abrogate the cytotoxic effect. Lymphocyte suspensions treated with anti-Thy 1 antiserum and complement exhibited a marked decrease in their cytotoxic potential when added to labeled target cells in the presence of M. arthritidis.

40|$|Serial {{studies of}} complement, immunoglobulins, lymphocytotoxins and immune {{complexes}} were performed in thirteen patients with uncomplicated infectious mononucleosis (IM). Two methods {{were used to}} detect immune complexes: a C 1 q-binding assay (C 1 q-BA) and the Raji-cell radioimmunoassay (RIA). Patients were followed until there was complete serological recovery. Individual complement components were normal or elevated but three patients showed initial reduction in total haemolytic activity. IgG, IgM, and IgA rose moderately during the acute phase. All sera showed thymocyte-specific cytotoxic activity at some time during the acute phase but were negative by 6 months. The C 1 q-BA was positive initially in twelve patients but had returned to normal by 6 months. The standard Raji RIA was negative in fifty out of fifty-five samples tested and it is proposed that this reflects the predominant IgM antibody response in these patients. In contrast, incorporation of a multispecific anti-immunoglobulin into this assay yielded data that was frequently positive; these correlated highly {{with that of the}} C 1 q-BA (P< 0 · 001). Lymphocytotoxic activity correlated with the C 1 q-BA (P< 0 · 001) and the modified Raji RIA (P< 0 · 05). Patterns of <b>lymphocytotoxicity</b> and immune complex reactivity suggested an inverse relationship between these two parameters.

40|$|Mouse {{and human}} {{interferon}} can modify the immune response in different and seemingly contradictory ways (1). Thus, interferon preparations inhibit lymphocyte proliferation {{in a primary}} mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) 1 (2 - 5) but, on the other hand, enhance <b>lymphocytotoxicity</b> (3 - 6). We wanted to determine the action of interferon on the generation of other functional lymphocyte subsets, such as allospecific primed lymphocytes (7, 8) or suppressor T lymphocytes (9 - 12). The results presented herein show that human interferon inhibits the generation of allospecific suppressor T lymphocytes that normally develop from lymphocytes primed in vitro against allogeneic ceils (9 - 12). This effect might influence considerably the generation of other functional lymphocyte subsets during an allogeneic response, such as cytotoxic effector cells and allospecific primed lymphocytes.

The induction of gag- and env-specific cell-mediated immune responses was studied in cats following vaccination with whole inactivated feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Cats were immunized by inoculation with three doses of paraformaldehyde-inactivated FIV, derived from the feline lymphoid cell line, FL- 4, which is persistently infected with the Petaluma isolate of FIV. Autologous or allogeneic skin fibroblasts either infected with recombinant FIV gag- or env-vaccinia virus or pulsed with FIV env peptides were used as targets in chromium- 51 release assays. Effector cells were fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Following the third immunization, all vaccinated cats, but none of the control cats immunized with adjuvant alone, had detectable FIV env-specific <b>lymphocytotoxicity</b> in their peripheral blood. Two cats also exhibited gag-specific activity. There was no recognition of either allogeneic skin fibroblasts infected with recombinant vaccinia virus or autologous target cells infected with wild-type vaccinia virus, indicating the specificity and MHC-restricted nature of the response. Vaccinated cats, but not control cats, were protected from challenge with the homologous Petaluma isolate of FIV. Partial epitope mapping of the env-specific cytotoxic response was performed using overlapping 10 -amino acid peptides from the env V 3 domain of FIV. This response appeared to be directed at env peptide 1 (RAISSWKQRN) and env peptide 3 (QRNRWEWRPD), which lie adjacent to a β-turn within the V 3 domain. This study clearly demonstrates that both gag- and env-specific <b>lymphocytotoxicity</b> are induced following vaccination of cats with whole inactivated FIV and thus contribute to the protective immunity observed in these animals...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{cellular}} immunity {{in the establishment}} and progression of immunosuppressive lentivirus infection remains equivocal. To develop a model system with which these aspects of the host immune response can be studied experimentally, we examined the response of cats to a hybrid peptide containing predicted T-and B-cell epitopes from the gag and env genes of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Cats were immunized with an unmodified 17 -residue peptide incorporating residues 196 to 208 (from gag capsid protein p 24) and 395 to 398 (from env glycoprotein gp 120) of the FIV Glasgow- 8 strain by using Quil A as an adjuvant. Virus-specific <b>lymphocytotoxicity</b> was measured by chromium- 51 release assays. The target cells were autologous or allogeneic skin fibroblasts either infected with recombinant FIV gag vaccinia virus or pulsed with FIV peptides. Effector cells were either fresh {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} or T-cell lines stimulated with FIV peptides in vitro. Cytotoxic effector cells from immunized cats lysed autologous, but not allogeneic, target cells when they were either infected with recombinant FIV gag vaccinia virus or pulsed with synthetic peptides comprising residues 196 to 205 or 200 to 208 plus 395. Depletion of CD 8 + T cells, from the effector cell population abrogated the <b>lymphocytotoxicity.</b> Immunized cats developed an antibody response to the 17 -residue peptide immunogen and to recombinant p 24. However, no antibodies which recognized smaller constituent peptides could be detected. This response correlated with peptide-induced T-cell proliferation in vitro. This study demonstrates that cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for FIV can be induced following immunization with an unmodified short synthetic peptide and defines a system in which the protective or pathological role of such responses can be examined...|$|E
40|$|Twelve {{information}} {{bone marrow}} transplants, {{with at least}} one difference in ABO and/or Lewis types between donor and recipient, were retrospectively studied. ABH and Lewis antigens were determined in plasma, erythrocytes, and lymphocytes. Donor lymphocytes acquired the ABH and Lewis antigens from the recipient's plasma {{in the same way that}} donor erythrocytes acquired the Lewis antigens from it. <b>Lymphocytotoxicity</b> detected type 1 ABH and Lewis antigens only, providing evidence for the existence of combined ABH and Lewis antigens on lymphocytes. This was in contrast with the ABH antigens on type 2 chains of red cells, which are devoid of Lewis specificities. The differences in genetic control, probable chemical structure, and cellular origin of these two types of ABH antigens are presented in a theoretical model that accounts for most of the known data...|$|E
40|$|Chimerism was {{demonstrated}} with immunocytochemical and/or {{polymerase chain reaction}} techniques in kidney allografts and in the native skin, lymph nodes, or blood of 5 of 5 patients who received continuously functioning renal transplants from 1 or 2 haplotype HLA mismatched consanguineous donors (4 parents, 1 aunt) 27 - 29 years ago. In the 4 cases where the kidney donor still was alive to provide stimulator lymphocytes for testing, these provoked no (n= 2) or modest (n= 2) MLR in contrast to vigorous MLR to third party lymphocytes. In all 4 cases, the donor cells failed to generate in vitro cytotoxic effector cells (cell-mediated <b>lymphocytotoxicity).</b> These findings are {{in accord with the}} hypothesis that cell migration, repopulation, and chimerism are seminal events that define graft acceptance and ultimately can lead to acquired donor-specific nonresponsiveness (tolerance). © 1993 Williams and wilkins...|$|E
