40|$|Abstract: Given the {{importance}} of endurance in boxing, especially when performance is prolonged for long periods and due to {{the significance of this}} on Cardio-Pulmonary fitness and effectiveness of the skills performance of boxers, this research aims to identify the effect of endurance training on the Cardio-Pulmonary fitness and effectiveness of the skills performance of boxers. The research used the experimental design to test two groups (experimental- control) of 10 boxers and conducting (pre- post) measurements on an intentional sample of 20 boxers. The strength <b>endurance</b> <b>test</b> was used, in addition to the <b>speed</b> <b>endurance</b> <b>test</b> and the Cardio-Pulmonary fitness test "Cunningham and Volknz Treadmill " to measure (pulse during exercise, the rate of O consumption per pulse) and the effectiveness of skill performance as well. The training program was 2 implemented for 12 weeks (four training sessions per week). The time of the session lasts between 75 and 135 minutes. The most important result was that the training program for the development of endurance had a positive impact. The highest percentage to endure strength was 88. 8 % and to endure speed was 82. 5 %. The lowest rates of improvement were the consumption of O per pulse (27. 8 %), the rate of pulse during effort 2 (4. 6 %), while the improvement rate of the effectiveness of skill performance reached 64. 3 %.

40|$|Alternative {{strategies}} for enhancing muscle glycogen resynthesis in horses Recovery of skeletal muscle glycogen is very slow in horses {{compared to other}} mammals studied, and can take 48 - 72 h, even when a highly soluble carbohydrate meal is fed immediately after exercise.

The studies described herein were intended to characterize the effects of supplemental acetate and effective rehydration on plasma and skeletal muscle in horses, in order to determine if the slow rate of muscle glycogen resythesis after glycogen-depleting exercise is due to a combination of slow recovery of hydration and inadequate shuttling of intracellular glucose towards glycogenesis.

40|$|There are {{two major}} goals in {{designing}} diets and feeding regimens for athletic horses: 1) to meet the caloric requirements for maintenance and the work performed; and 2) to optimize substrate availability and utilization during exercise. Although {{there is a substantial}} body of knowledge pertaining to the digestible energy requirements for working horses, the effects of different diets and pre-exercise feeding strategies on substrate utilization during exercise are less well understood. Several important questions arise when considering the effects of a dietary manipulation on substrate metabolism during exercise. First, do such manipulations alter substrate availability during exercise? (e. g. greater availability of muscle glycogen or circulating free fatty acids). Second, does the manipulation alter the mix of substrates utilized during exercise? (e. g. greater use of fat when fed a fat-supplemented diet). Finally, is there a change in the relative contribu-tions by muscle (glycogen, triacylglycerols) vs. non-muscle (blood glucose and fatty acids) fuel sources to energy production?

40|$|Experimental {{evaluation}} under simulated engine conditions {{revealed that}} conventional mainshaft seals have disadvantages of high gas leakage rates and wear. An advanced seal concept, the self-acting face seal, {{has a much}} lower gas leakage rate and greater pressure and <b>speed</b> capability. In <b>endurance</b> <b>tests</b> (150 hr) to 43 200 rpm the self-acting seal wear was not measurable, indicating noncontact sealing operation was maintained even at this high rotative speed. A review of published data revealed that the leakage through gas path seals has {{a significant effect on}} TSFC, stall margin and engine maintenance. Reducing leakages by reducing seal clearances results in rubbing contact, and then the seal thermal response and wear determines the final seal clearances. The control of clearances requires a material with the proper combination of rub tolerance (abradability) and erosion resistance.

The present study used the physicochemical approach to characterize the changes in acid-base status occurring after oral NaAcetate/acetic acid (NAA) administration in horses. Methods Jugular venous blood was sampled from 9 exercise-conditioned horses on 2 separate occasions, at rest and for 24 h following a competition exercise test (CET) designed to simulate the <b>speed</b> and <b>endurance</b> <b>test</b> of 3 -day event. Immediately after the CETs horses were allowed water ad libitum and either: 1) 8 L of a hypertonic NaAcetate/acetic acid solution via nasogastric tube followed by a typical hay/grain meal (NAA trial); or 2) a hay/grain meal alone (Control trial). Results Oral NAA resulted in a profound plasma alkalosis marked by decreased plasma [H +] and increased plasma [TCO 2] and [HCO 3 -] compared to Control. The primary contributor to the plasma alkalosis was an increased [SID], {{as a result of}} increased plasma [Na +] and decreased plasma [Cl -]. An increased [A tot], due to increased [PP] and a sustained increase in plasma [acetate], contributed a minor acidifying effect. Conclusion It is concluded that oral NaAcetate could be used as both an alkalinizing agent and an alternative energy source in the horse. </p...|$|R

40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the seasonal changes that occur in the anthropometric, physical and motor characteristics of elite junior soccer players over the course of a training year. The participants targeted were elite soccer players from the NMMU-FCK Soccer School of Excellence and a total of 18 players between the ages of 15 to 18 years were recruited to comprise the sample for the study. The participants in the sample were assessed on four separate occasions. Each testing period was separated by a three month interval with the first testing period taking place in June 2005, at the start of their pre-season period, and the last testing session taking place in March of the following year, at the end of their playing season. In order to determine which specific characteristics of soccer were to be tested, the relevant literature was reviewed to establish the requirements, attributes and indicators of success in elite soccer. Therefore the test battery used was compiled in an attempt to address each of the identified physical attributes that contributes to successful soccer play. The battery included the following tests: weight, height and percentage body fat to represent the anthropometric characteristics. The physical characteristics were assessed by <b>testing</b> flexibility, anaerobic <b>speed</b> <b>endurance,</b> aerobic endurance, and muscular strength tests (1 RM bench and leg press, grip strength, and isokinetic knee strength). The motor assessments comprised of tests for speed (10 -m, 20 -m, and 40 -m), explosive leg power (vertical jump), agility, and soccer-specific tests (dribbling and shooting at goal). In addition maturity status during the study was assessed using grip strength and height scores. All of the participants within the study sample were assessed on each day of the testing period, in alphabetical order, and this order was maintained during each testing period. Each of the four testing sessions lasted three days. On entering the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University-Biokinetics and Sport Science Centre (NMMU-BSSC) laboratory on day 1, the participants completed the test battery in the following order: anthropometric measurements (weight, height, skinfolds), flexibility test (sit and reach), leg power test (vertical jump), muscular strength tests (1 RM bench press, 1 RM leg press, grip strength), and an aerobic <b>endurance</b> <b>test</b> (Multi-Stage Shuttle Run). The tests conducted on day 2 of the test battery were conducted as field tests at the NMMU-FCK soccer playing fields and the participants completed the tests in the same alphabetical order as day 1. The testing battery was conducted in the following order: speed tests (10 m, 20 m, and 40 m sprinting), agility test (Illinois agility run), soccer-specific tests (dribbling and accuracy <b>tests),</b> <b>speed</b> <b>endurance</b> <b>test</b> (Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test). Testing on day 3 consisted of Isokinetic dynamometry strength testing and was conducted at the NMMU-BSSC. Each participant completed the testing protocol according to the same alphabetical order as was used on days 1 and 2. In order to achieve the aim of the study, the following objectives were set: to determine the anthropometric, physical and motor characteristics of the participants at the pre-season, start of season, mid-season and end of season stages of the training year and to identify the peak scores achieved for each variable tested; to compare the variables tested at each of the four testing sessions to determine the progression of each variable tested and to identify at which testing session peak performance related fitness was achieved; to compare the results obtained with relevant data from other research literature; and to monitor the maturation status of the participants. Based on the results achieved it can be concluded that the participants achieved peak physical fitness at the mid-season period (testing session 3). It would appear that the attainment of these results was determined by the participants being exposed to both a pre-season and an in-season training period. It seems that both the completion of the specific types of training that occurred during these two periods, as well as the competitive matches played, elevated the participants physical fitness to the levels required for success at the elite level...|$|R
40|$|The bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) {{is one of}} {{the most}} commercially {{important}} freshwater fish species in China, but their abundance has declined considerably in recent decades, partly due to river regulation. In other countries it is invasive, posing an ecological and economic threat. To improve fish pass effectiveness at impediments to migration in its native range, and create velocity barriers to reduce range expansion where it is invasive, an improved understanding of swimming ability and behaviour is needed. The burst, prolonged, and sustained swimming performance of juvenile bighead carp were quantified experimentally through constant acceleration trials (Umax), fixed velocity tests, and volitional passage efficiency trials through three consecutive constrictions. The effects of fork length (FL), temperature, swimming speed and method (swim chamber/open channel flume section) on endurance in fixed velocity trials were evaluated. The utilisation of low velocity areas close to the flume edge and floor at different mid-channel velocities was also explored. The mean sustained swimming <b>speed</b> in <b>endurance</b> <b>tests</b> was 3. 84 FL s? 1 (range equivalent to 0. 37 – 0. 78 m s? 1), and burst speeds reached 12. 78 FL s? 1 (up to 1. 22 m s? 1 for larger fish). The meanUmax was 6. 81 FL s ? 1 (0. 51 m s? 1). In fixed velocity trials, method did not influence endurance and fish rarely utilised low velocity areas in the corners of the flume when water velocity exceeded sustained swimming ability. Passage efficiency decreased at successive flume constrictions, possibly indicating a poor repeat burst swimming performance. Field validation is required to verify wild bighead carp behaviour and passage in the hydraulic conditions created by fish passes...|$|R
