40|$|ABSTRACT. Although {{numbers of}} buffleheads (Bucephala albeola), common goldeneyes (Bucephala clangula) and <b>long-tailed</b> <b>ducks</b> (Clangula hyemalis) over-wintering on Lake Ontario have {{increased}} sub-stantially {{over the past}} two decades, factors influencing habitat use and the potential for competition have not been investigated. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the relationship between prey availability and community structure of diving ducks during winter on northeastern Lake Ontario. Ben-thic and nektonic samples collected during fall, winter, and spring 2002 – 2004 indicated that macroinver-tebrate numbers differed by location but generally did not decline throughout winter. Large accumula-tions of macroinvertebrates, apparently moved by wave action and currents, were documented in nearshore areas. Surveys showed that diving ducks congregated in mixed species flocks within areas of higher food abundance. Mixed species flocks were common in nearshore areas, likely because energy-dense foods (Amphipoda and Chironomidae) were abundant in the narrow zone of shallow water, close to shore. Although macroinvertebrate numbers likely affected habitat use by diving ducks, birds did not greatly reduce abundance of macroinvertebrates. It is unlikely that exploitative competition was occur-ring and interference competition appeared below threshold levels that would cause species to spatially segregate. Overall, our results suggest that food availability is not a limiting factor for buffleheads, com-mon goldeneyes, or <b>long-tailed</b> <b>ducks</b> wintering on northeastern Lake Ontario...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Population {{estimates}} for <b>long-tailed</b> <b>ducks</b> in North America have declined by nearly 50 % {{over the past}} 30 years. Life history and population dynamics of this species are difficult to ascertain, because the birds nest at low densities across {{a broad range of}} habitat types. Between 1991 and 2004, we collected information on productivity and survival of <b>long-tailed</b> <b>ducks</b> at three locations on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. Clutch size averaged 7. 1 eggs, and nesting success averaged 30 %. Duckling survival to 30 days old averaged 10 % but was highly variable among years, ranging from 0 % to 25 %. Apparent annual survival of adult females based on mark-recapture of nesting females was estimated at 74 %. We combined these estimates of survival and productivity into a matrix-based population model, which predicted an annual population decline of 19 %. Elasticities indicated that population growth rate (λ) was most sensitive to changes in adult female survival. Further, the relatively high sensitivity of λ to duckling survival suggests that low duckling survival may be a bottleneck to productivity in some years. These data represent the first attempt to synthesize a population model for this species. Although our analyses were hampered by the small sample sizes inherent in studying a dispersed nesting species, our model provides a basis for management actions and can be enhanced as additional data become available...|$|R
