50|$|During 1895 Röntgen was {{investigating}} the external {{effects from the}} various types of vacuum tube equipment — apparatuses from Heinrich Hertz, Johann Hittorf, William Crookes, Nikola Tesla and Philipp von Lenard — when an electrical discharge is passed through them. In early November, he was repeating an experiment with one of Lenard's tubes in which a thin aluminium window had been added to permit the cathode rays to exit the tube but a cardboard covering was added to protect the aluminium from damage by the strong electrostatic field that produces the cathode rays. He knew the cardboard covering prevented light from escaping, yet Röntgen observed that the invisible cathode rays caused a fluorescent effect on a small cardboard screen painted with barium platinocyanide when it was placed close to the aluminium window. It occurred to Röntgen that the Crookes-Hittorf tube, which had a much thicker glass wall than the <b>Lenard</b> <b>tube,</b> might also cause this fluorescent effect.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 8 November 1895, Röntgen was determined to test his idea. He carefully constructed a black cardboard covering {{similar to the one}} he had used on the <b>Lenard</b> <b>tube.</b> He covered the Crookes-Hittorf tube with the cardboard and attached electrodes to a Ruhmkorff coil to generate an electrostatic charge. Before setting up the barium platinocyanide screen to test his idea, Röntgen darkened the room to test the opacity of his cardboard cover. As he passed the Ruhmkorff coil charge through the tube, he determined that the cover was light-tight and turned to prepare the next step of the experiment. It was at this point that Röntgen noticed a faint shimmering from a bench {{a few feet away from}} the tube. To be sure, he tried several more discharges and saw the same shimmering each time. Striking a match, he discovered the shimmering had come from the location of the barium platinocyanide screen he had been intending to use next.|$|E
40|$|The known {{electron}} beam outlet windows (<b>Lenard</b> <b>tube)</b> {{have a high}} absorption {{as a result of}} the required thickness of the foil or use cooling devices and complex support structures. By avoiding these disadvantages, a simple-to-produce window with low absorption can be produced. The beam outlet window in known devices is enclosed in a vacuum-tight metallic foil and, resting on it on the vacuum side is a support grid made of high-temperature-resistant fibre bundles attached in a frame. The {{electron beam}} outlet window is specially suited for relatively low electron energies at high electron beam power density...|$|E
2500|$|On November 8, 1895, German physics {{professor}} Wilhelm Röntgen {{stumbled on}} X-rays while experimenting with <b>Lenard</b> and Crookes <b>tubes</b> and began studying them. He wrote an initial report [...] "On {{a new kind}} of ray: A preliminary communication" [...] and on December 28, 1895 submitted it to Würzburg's Physical-Medical Society journal. This was the first paper written on X-rays. Röntgen referred to the radiation as [...] "X", to indicate that it was an unknown type of radiation. The name stuck, although (over Röntgen's great objections) many of his colleagues suggested calling them Röntgen rays. They are still referred to as such in many languages, including German, Danish, Polish, Swedish, Finnish, Estonian, Russian, Japanese, Dutch, and Norwegian. Röntgen received the first Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery.|$|R
