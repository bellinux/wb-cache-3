The freeway continues northward along the western residential neighborhoods, encountering the northern end of I-475 near Mount Morris.

The <b>landscape</b> <b>changes</b> to include more farm fields once road passes the lake. C-66 intersects I-75 at exit326 along the latter. On {{the east side of}} the interchange, Levering Road passes Sea Shell City, a tourist trap, and turns northeastward into Hebron Township. C-66 then turns easterly again before it crosses into Beaugrand Township, taking the additional name Cheboygan Road. The roadway crosses branches of the Little Black River and passes to the south of the Cheboygan County Airport. East of the airport, C-66 enters the city of Cheboygan and follows State Street into town; this area is residential in nature. State Street crosses the North Central State Trail, a rail trail, before turning to the southeast. The roadway passes into the northern end of downtown near several smaller businesses.. C-66 terminates at a four-way intersection with Main Street one block west of the Cheboygan River; this intersection also marks the northern terminus of M-27. As a county-designated highway, C-66 is maintained by the Emmet and Cheboygan county road commissions (ECRC, CCRC) in their respective counties.|$|E

There is a well-established need to detect <b>landscape</b> <b>change</b> so that appropriate policies for the regional sustainable development can be developed. <b>Landscape</b> <b>change</b> detection is considered to be effectively repeated surveillance and needs especially strict protocols to identify the change categories and intensity.

40|$|We {{suggest that}} the life {{histories}} of species within communities may differ among geographic locations and that communities from distinct biomes may respond uniquely to a given trajectory of <b>landscape</b> <b>change.</b> This paper presents initial tests relevant to these hypotheses. First, the representation of various life-history guilds in avifaunas from the Eastern Deciduous (EDF) and Pacific Northwest (PNW) forests were compared. Three guilds contained more species in the EDF community (large patch and/or habitat interior guild, small patch and/or edge guild, and fragmentation-sensitive guild). The guild of predators requiring large forest tracts was better represented in the PNW. Next, the relative sensitivity of each community to habitat change was ranked based on the life-history traits of their species. The EDF avifauna had a significantly higher index of sensitivity to both forest fragmentation and to <b>landscape</b> <b>change</b> in general. Among the birds with high scores for sensitivity to <b>landscape</b> <b>change</b> were several species that have received little conservation attention thus far including some associated with open-canopy habitats. Lastly, the validity of using life histories to predict community response to <b>landscape</b> <b>change</b> {{was supported by the}} fact that the sensitivity scores for PNW species correlated significantly with independent data on species population trends. While more rigorous analyses are suggested, we conclude that knowledge of life histories is useful for predicting commu- nity response to <b>landscape</b> <b>change</b> and that conservation strategies should be uniquely tailored to local com- munities. 1...|$|R

Mining conflicts between companies and local people have intensified; this highlights {{the necessity of}} a better understanding of environmental and social consequences of mining activities. Landscape studies could be relevant to understand such problematic. I aim to assess the <b>landscape</b> <b>change</b> in a mining area by (1) mapping the physical <b>landscape</b> <b>change</b> and (2) surveying the local landscape people’s perception of the physical <b>landscape</b> <b>change.</b> I approach the material dimension through spatial-regional interpretation of diachronic aerial-photos to produce Land cover-Land use maps and to allow further temporal comparison towards change detection in a GIS environment. The mental dimension was surveyed through the analysis of semi-structured interviews {{of the people who were}} living in the area of the mine and who lives now on its surroundings. The material landscape analysis shows a change rate of 75 % in seven years (1993 - 2000) in the whole study area; and of 52 % in areas outside the mining facilities. This is mainly from the conversion of seminatural grassland into mining and sparse grassland. These results correlated positively with local people’s perception of environmental transformations, as the dramatic reduction of basic livelihood resources such as grassland and water.

40|$|Abstract All <b>landscapes</b> <b>change</b> continuously. Since {{change is}} {{perceived}} and in-terpreted through measures of scale, any quantitative analysis of landscapes must identify {{and describe the}} spatiotemporal mosaics shaped by large-scale structures and processes. This process is controlled by core influences, or "drivers, " that shape the change and affect the outcome depending on their magnitude and intensity. Our understanding of <b>landscape</b> <b>change</b> and its drivers depends upon many different sources of information of varying quality and breadth- some quantitative, some systematic, others anecdotal or qualitative. In this respect, large-scale surveys and inventories capable of documenting landscape composition, structure, and dynarn-ics, both past and present, can prove to be vital tools for addressing contemporary resource issues. This chapter examines the role of large-scale inventories in iden-tifying <b>landscape</b> <b>change</b> and developing hypotheses about the underlying drivers. Although a number of such sources exist, we shall focus on two from the United States: the Public Land Surveys (1785 - 1900), and the US Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis program (1930 s-present). After defining landscapes and providing definitions and examples of <b>landscape</b> <b>change,</b> we evaluate these surveys {{with respect to their}} potential use for ecological analysis, and present examples of their use for ecosystem reconstruction. These longitudinal comparisons are a good first step in understanding the biophysical processes that drive <b>landscape</b> <b>change,</b> but determining the influence of other drivers- social, cultural, or economic- requires other sources of information that are rarely systematic or conclusive. To this end, cautious analysis and conservative conclusions are essential when employing this mix of data sources...|$|R
