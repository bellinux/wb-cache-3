5|$|Historians {{believe that}} the strike, and other strikes in Africa during the period, changed the urban and {{migration}} policies of the British government in Africa. Governor Hubert Young, after a long struggle, obtained research funding of <b>labour</b> <b>migration</b> in Africa. Historian Godfrey Wilson studied urban African labour from 1939 to 1940, but his work was halted. Although the strike achieved little at the time, it is seen a key moment {{in the emergence of}} African nationalism in Zambia. African townsmen discovered their identity, leading to trade unionism and the gradual emergence of anti-colonial politics. The actions by British authorities led to five years of prosperity for the mining companies; European miners struck for higher pay and were rewarded. In 1940, there were several mine strikes in the province which lasted over a week; 17 workers were killed and 65 injured.|$|E

40|$|This article investigates how <b>labour</b> <b>migrations</b> {{of rural}} {{households}} from Leonzoane in Southern Mozambique {{have changed since}} the colonial period to a post-war (1992) and post-apartheid (1994) context and their links with livelihoods restructuring. It draws on a qualitative analysis {{of the features of}} <b>labour</b> <b>migrations,</b> through a sample of households on five generations. Results reveal the evolution of men's forms of mobility from longstanding circular and formal migrations to South Africa's mines, toward multi-sited, informal, and more flexible migrations into mining and other sectors. These renewed forms of mobility are a core element of households' livelihoods restructuring, as part of strategies to adapt the changing political-economic constraints of the broader globalising environment in terms of increasing informal and volatile labour conditions. The article concludes with a call for further analysis and integration of migration features in development policies. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

500|$|Clarke had to {{deal with}} four natural {{disasters}} during his tenure. An outbreak of smallpox in 1894 was the result of <b>labour</b> <b>migration</b> and men returning from working in Witwatersrand. When it proved too costly for the people, he waived the charge for the vaccination. Locust swarms in 1894 and 1895 caused damage to crops and resulted in famine in 1896. The government response was to offer the chief of each tribe a reward of 3d for every muid of locusts collected as well as cattle to slaughter when a swarm was eradicated. At the same time, Clarke bought 1,090 muids of quick-growing mealies to be given on payment to families requiring immediate relief, a measure of which Sir Walter Hely-Hutchinson, Governor of Natal, approved: [...] "It is better {{to err on the side}} of unnecessary expenditure than to run the risk of exposing the people to starvation." [...] Finally, in 1897, an outbreak of rinderpest killed many cattle and the government responded with a programme of inoculation.|$|E

40|$|Recently, the {{migration}} phenomenon has acquired such dimensions and exhibited such implications on various social spheres {{that it has}} turned into not only a global phenomenon giving shape to a transnational area, but a real state of mind of new generations - it offers an equal option within the array of possibilities for success in (or better quality of) daily lifein short, it {{has turned into a}} thinking pattern giving rise to the "culture of migration". Formal and informal sources indicate that both registered and unregistered <b>labour</b> <b>migrations</b> are on the increase in the Slovene-Italian border area. It is largely due to the specific nature of the labour market and the abolishment of physical borders within the Schengen area that there is a constant {{increase in the number of}} not only daily and temporary economic migrations from Slovenia to the Italian labour market in the province of Trieste, but also medium-term migrations to more remote Italian regions. In the Slovene-Italian area, daily commuting to the Italian labour market has turned into a local tradition as over the past few decades a number of Slovene women have been commuting to Trieste to do housework. In addition to these "traditional" illegal female <b>labour</b> <b>migrations</b> to Italy in the field of housework, the past few years witnessed the emergence of new forms of migration: <b>labour</b> <b>migrations</b> of educated young people (legal or illegal brain drain to Western European states) and illegal male migrations of uneducated and vocational labour force (largely to Italy and Austria). The present study was part of research conducted within the extensive applied project "Minorities and Border Social Realities as Factors of Integration Process. Case Study of the Slovene-Italian Contact Area" (Sedmak, M. et al., 2008), with its aim being to investigate why individuals decide on such <b>labour</b> <b>migrations,</b> where they get information, how they establish contacts, and what factors and conditions influence their choice of work. Special emphasis was placed on the dynamics of unregistered economic migrations at local level that had transformed from occasional undeclared work undertaken by the senior segment of the female population of Slovene Istria into the general model of accommodation to the labour market...|$|R

2500|$|In its {{broadest}} sense {{within the}} Malaysian context, illegal immigration to Malaysia {{refers to the}} [...] cross-border movement of people to reside in Malaysia, under conditions where official authorisation is lacking, breached, expired, fraudulent, or irregular in some way. The [...] cross-border movement of workers has become a well-established feature of Southeast Asia, with Malaysia {{one of the major}} labour receiving countries, and Indonesia and the Philippines the region’s main labour sending states.

2500|$|There {{were two}} {{distinct}} periods of recruitment. During the first period, which lasted until 1966, {{a large number}} of Turks came to the Netherlands through unofficial channels, either being recruited by employers or immigrating spontaneously. A small economic recession began in 1966. Some of the labour migrants were forced to return to Turkey. In 1968, the economy picked up again and a new recruitment period, which was to last until 1974, commenced. In May 1968, new European Economic Community rules forced the Netherlands to instate a travel visa system to regulate labour immigration and from then on, the state recruited foreign workers. The peak of Turkish <b>labour</b> <b>migration</b> occurred during these years. The Turks eventually surpassed other migrant nationalities in numbers and came to represent the Dutch image of guest workers. Due to the 1973 oil crisis, the Den Uyl cabinet ended labour immigration in 1974. Because from then on re-entry into the Netherlands was impossible, Turkish remigration strongly decreased. A system of family reunification had been arranged in the 1960s and gradually Turkish workers after 1974 brought over their wife and children. The latter predominantly married partners from Turkey. In the early twenty-first century the Second Balkenende cabinet imposed much stricter conditions on unification, to a large extent ending Turkish [...] "marriage immigration". This coincided with a drop in birth rates, leading to a gradual levelling off in the growth of people of Turkish descent. Since 2003, there have often been years with an emigration surplus.|$|E
