40|$|AbstractThirty-two {{neonates}} and {{infants with}} pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect were initially investigated with cross-sectional and spectral Doppler echocardiography and Doppler color flow mapping. All 32 had subsequent correlative angiography. This demonstrated that 24 infants had adequate-sized right and <b>left</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> (19 confluent, 5 nonconfluent). Of the five infants with nonconfluent <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries,</b> four had bilateral ductus arteriosus and {{one had a}} single left-sided ductus with anomalous origin of the right <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> from the ascending aorta. Nineteen infants had confluent <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries,</b> {{all of which were}} supplied by a single ductus. Eight infants had complete absence of or inadequate pulmonary arteries; all had multiple aortopulmonary collateral vessels arising from the descending aorta. The presence of adequate-sized right and <b>left</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> was correctly predicted in 21 of 24 infants by cross-sectional echocardiography alone and in all 24 by Doppler color flow mapping. Confluence of the right and <b>left</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> was predicted by cross-sectional imaging in 14 of the 19 infants in whom it occurred, and by Doppler color flow mapping in all 19 infants. The precise definition of the pulmonary blood supply was correctly predicted by Doppler color flow mapping in 16 of the 19 infants with confluent <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> and a single ductus. However, in three infants in this group, Doppler color flow mapping made a false diagnosis of multiple aortopulmonary collateral vessels. In the eight infants with inadequate <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries,</b> Doppler color flow mapping correctly predicted the presence of two or more aortopulmonary collateral vessels, but it was unreliable in predicting the multifocal pulmonary blood supply in four of five patients with nonconfluent <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries.</b> In summary, Doppler color flow mapping improved the noninvasive evaluation of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect. It consistently identified adequate-sized confluent <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> supplied by a single ductus. In such cases, systemic pulmonary shunting can be performed without prior angiography. However, when Doppler color flow mapping suggested a multifocal pulmonary blood supply, the morphology was too complex to allow accurate ultrasound definition and angiography remained the essential diagnostic technique...|$|R

Oxygen concentration causes the production of bradykinin which causes the ductus to constrict occluding all flow. Within 1-3 months, the ductus is obliterated and becomes the ligamentum arteriosum.|$|E

50|$|The {{aortic arch}} loops over the <b>left</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> and the {{bifurcation}} of the pulmonary trunk, {{to which it}} remains connected by the ligamentum arteriosum, a remnant of the fetal circulation that is obliterated {{a few days after}} birth. In addition to these blood vessels, the aortic arch crosses the left main bronchus. Between the aortic arch and the pulmonary trunk is a network of autonomic nerve fibers, the cardiac plexus or aortic plexus. The left vagus nerve, which passes anterior to the aortic arch, gives off a major branch, the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which loops under the aortic arch just lateral to the ligamentum arteriosum.

40|$|ObjectivesOur {{model of}} a systemic–pulmonary shunt {{exhibits}} enhanced reactivity of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> contralateral to a localized shunt between the <b>left</b> lower lobe <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> and aorta relative to those of ipsilateral or control <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> 48 hours after anastomosis. We examined the contribution of nitric oxide, cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, or cytochrome P 450 production to mediating this enhanced reactivity. MethodsWe created a surgical end-to-side anastomosis of the <b>left</b> lower lobe <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> to the aorta. Forty-eight hours later, we tested tension of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> rings from {{the right and left}} lower lobes for contraction to the thromboxane mimetic U 46619 in the presence of vehicle or inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase, cytochrome P 450, or lipoxygenase. Western blots of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> homogenates were probed for endothelial nitric oxide synthase or isoforms metabolizing arachidonic acid. Eicosanoid products from intact <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> rings were detected using labeled arachidonic acid and high-performance liquid chromatography separation. ResultsEnhanced reactivity of unshunted right <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> over that of <b>left</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> from high-flow hosts was not eliminated by inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase, cytochrome P 450.

The left bronchus has no eparterial branch, and therefore it has been supposed by some that there is no upper lobe to the left lung, but that the so-called upper lobe corresponds to the middle lobe of the right lung. The left main bronchus divides into two secondary bronchi or lobar bronchi, to deliver air to the two lobes of the left lung—the superior and the inferior lobe.|$|E
5000|$|In September 1925, Blalock joined Tinsley Harrison at Vanderbilt University in Nashville to {{complete}} his residency under Barney Brooks, Vanderbilt University Hospital's first Professor of Surgery and Chief of the Surgical Service. During his Vanderbilt years, Blalock {{spent much of his}} time in the surgical research laboratory, which he found both challenging and exciting. [...] While at Vanderbilt, Blalock became interested and began studying the nature and treatment of hemorrhagic and traumatic shock. At Vanderbilt, in the year 1938, Blalock conducted an experiment where the left subclavian artery was connected to the <b>left</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery.</b> The experiment was meant to induce pulmonary hypertension, but it ended up failing. By conducting his research and mainly experimenting on dogs, Blalock discovered that surgical shock resulted from the loss of blood, which led him to encourage the use of blood plasma or whole blood products to prevent. Blalock's innovative research resulted in the saving of many lives on the battlefield during World War II. Unfortunately, Blalock had frequent bouts of tuberculosis, which developed during his later years at Vanderbilt.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess whether}} MR imaging could replace {{angiography}} in preoperative evaluation {{of patients with}} tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (VSD), especially since the surgical correction was done earlier than was previously the rule. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with tetralogy of Fallot (n = 10) or pulmonary atresia with VSD (n = 4), mean age 7. 5 +/- 4. 4 months, were evaluated with angiocardiography and MR before definitive surgical correction. RESULTS: There was good diagnostic agreement between the two modalities when evaluating right ventricular outflow obstruction; 86 % for valvular and 93 % for supravalvular stenosis, but the agreement was somewhat lower for the subvalvular obstruction (57 %). Surgery findings, however, were in favour of MR in 5 patients concerning the subvalvular right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. MR images identified all stenoses in the right and <b>left</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries,</b> but overlooked one stenosis in the main <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery.</b> MR could evaluate patency in all palliative shunts. CONCLUSION: Even in this young age group, MR imaging offers a good alternative to angiocardiography for the pre-operative evaluation of the right ventricular outflow tract, the main <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> and the proximal right and <b>left</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries,</b> before definitive surgical correction of tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary atresia with VSD...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} assess {{the effects of a}} {{localized}} anastomosis between the aorta and <b>left</b> lower lobe <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> on flows through central vessels and on the vascular reactivity of small <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> distal or contralateral to the shunt. MethodsFlow rates in major vessels and tensions from small <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> from the <b>left</b> and right lower lobes were determined 48 hours after creation of an end-to-side anastomosis of the <b>left</b> lower lobe <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> to the aorta. ResultsAnastomoses increased flow through the <b>left</b> lower lobe <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> from 194  ± 6 to 452  ± 18 mL/min immediately after anastomosis to 756  ± 19 mL/min by the time of harvest (n =  88, P < . 05). Flow rates in main <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> from hosts with anastomoses were lower (557  ± 26 vs 1033  ± 244 mL/min), whereas aortic root flows were not different from control values (1370  ± 53 vs 1120  ± 111 mL/min; P = . 07). Wet/dry weights of both lungs and aortic flow rates were proportional to shunt flow rates. <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> rings harvested from the right (unshunted) lobes of high-flow hosts exhibited increased reactivity to the thromboxane agonist U 46619 and phenylephrine relative to those of <b>left</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> from the same animal or those of control hosts. ConclusionsOur studies are the first to identify enhanced reactivity of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> in a lung contralateral to a localized high-output shunt between an aorta and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery.</b> These observations suggest that patients with localized systemic-to-pulmonary shunt could exhibit modified vascular tone in remote <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries...</b>|$|R

40|$|Unilateral {{absence of}} a {{pulmonary}} artery (UAPA) is a rare pulmonary vascular anomaly that is usually associated with other cardiac anomalies. We report a 9 -year-old female diagnosed with isolated unilateral absence of the <b>left</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> and a right aortic arch but without other cardiac anomalies. The only symptoms the patient had were recurrent respiratory tract infections. The chest x-rays showed asymmetric lung fields, prompting subsequent studies. A series of imaging studies including chest x-rays, esophagography, echocardiography, chest computed tomography, lung ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy, angiocardiography, and 3 -dimensional magnetic resonance angiography (3 D-MRA) were done. The diagnosis was confirmed by the cardiac catheterization and pulmonary angiography, which disclosed absence of the <b>left</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery.</b> 3 D-MRA conclusively demonstrated total absence of the <b>left</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> without an occult <b>left</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> or systemic-to-pulmonary collateral arteries.

40|$|The {{distribution}} and mode of the afferent nerve endings in the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> were studied. The materials for research were 2 ̆ 7 taken from six adult dogs and first fixed in Richardson 2 ̆ 7 s solution, cut into 30 - 40 μ frozen sections, and then stained with Seto 2 ̆ 7 s silver impregnation method. The afferent nerve endings {{considered to be}} connected with the blood pressure reflex were classified into four types, the arborescent, the glomerular, the simple branched and the unbranched endings. The arborescent type was subdivided into the circumscribed and the diffuse subtypes. The arborizations of these subtypes were rather simpler in form and structure than the typical baroreceptors found in the aortic arch and carotid sinus, but resembled closely their functionally identical endings. These terminations were supplied by maximum-sized nerve fibers showing conspic uous change in size and meandering during their courses. While the diffuse types were restricted to the supero-posterior aspect of the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> bifurcation, the circumscribed {{were found in the}} posterior wall of the incipient portions of the right and <b>left</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries.</b> A notable feature of these baroreceptors was that they were accompanied by numerous special nuclei, the nature of which could not be determined, while the other types of ending, were mostly devoid of them. The glomerular. endings were more numerous than the others, but contained every stage of complexity from simple to intricate forms. They originated in the medium-sized or large fibers and were most abundant in the supero-posterior aspect of the bifurcatio trunci pulmonaris, but some of them were distributed also in the incipient parts of the right and <b>left</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries.</b> The simple branched and unbranched endings arising mostly from the small and medium-sized fibers, and partly from the large fibers were found chiefly arranged circularly in the muscular layers, so that the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> bifurcation and adjacent portions of the right and <b>left</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> were almost completely surrounded by these nerve terminations.
