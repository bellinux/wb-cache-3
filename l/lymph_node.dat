50|$|<b>Lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> {{are present}} {{throughout}} the body, are more concentrated near {{and within the}} trunk, and are divided {{in the study of}} anatomy into groups. Some <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> can be felt when enlarged (and occasionally when not), such as the axillary <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> under the arm, the cervical <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> {{of the head and neck}} and the inguinal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> near the groin crease. Some <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> can be seen, such as the tonsils. Most <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> however lie within the trunk adjacent to other major structures in the body - such as the paraaortic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and the tracheobronchial <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{inferior}} mesenteric <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> drain structures {{related to}} the hindgut. The <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> drain into the superior mesenteric <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and ultimately to the preaortic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> <b>Lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> surrounding the inferior mesenteric artery drain directly into the preaortic nodes.|$|R
50|$|The deep {{inguinal}} <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> drain superiorly to {{the external}} iliac <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> then to the pelvic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> {{and on to the}} paraaortic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b>|$|R
5|$|Stage I: HIV {{infection}} is asymptomatic with a CD4+ T cell count (also known as CD4 count) greater than 500 per microlitre (µl or cubic mm) of blood. May include generalized <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> enlargement.|$|E
5|$|The {{evaluation}} of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) staging uses the TNM classification. This {{is based on}} the size of the primary tumor, <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement, and distant metastasis.|$|E
5|$|Enlargement of the spleen {{may occur}} in AML, {{but it is}} {{typically}} mild and asymptomatic. <b>Lymph</b> <b>node</b> swelling is rare in AML, in contrast to acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The skin is involved about 10% {{of the time in}} the form of leukemia cutis. Rarely, Sweet's syndrome, a paraneoplastic inflammation of the skin, can occur with AML.|$|E
50|$|Mesenteric glands, or {{mesenteric}} <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> are nodes {{located in}} the mesentery. They are of three classes: mesenteric <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> juxta-intestinal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> and the superior middle group of mesenteric <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The preaortic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> lie {{in front}} of the aorta, and may be divided into celiac <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> {{superior}} mesenteric <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> and inferior mesenteric <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> groups, arranged around the origins of the corresponding arteries.|$|R
30|$|The CT {{part of the}} PET/CT is {{important}} to detect <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in areas with high intestinal activity. To distinguish <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in these areas, acquisition of CT images of diagnostic quality with administration of intravenous iodinated contrast is necessary. Once <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> are detected on CT, the combination of PET and CT may distinguish malignant <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> from physiological <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> however, especially in small <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> characterisation may remain difficult.|$|R
5|$|Radiotherapy {{is often}} given {{together}} with chemotherapy, {{and may be}} used with curative intent in people with NSCLC who {{are not eligible for}} surgery. This form of high-intensity radiotherapy is called radical radiotherapy. A refinement of this technique is continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART), in which a high dose of radiotherapy is given in a short time period. Postoperative thoracic radiotherapy generally should not be used after curative intent surgery for NSCLC. Some people with mediastinal N2 <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement might benefit from post-operative radiotherapy.|$|E
5|$|If {{investigations}} confirm NSCLC, {{the stage}} is assessed {{to determine whether the}} disease is localized and amenable to surgery or if it has spread {{to the point where it}} cannot be cured surgically. CT scan and positron emission tomography are used for this determination. If mediastinal <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement is suspected, the nodes may be sampled to assist staging. Techniques used for this include transthoracic needle aspiration, transbronchial needle aspiration (with or without endobronchial ultrasound), endoscopic ultrasound with needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy, and thoracoscopy. Blood tests and pulmonary function testing are used to assess whether a person is well enough for surgery. If pulmonary function tests reveal poor respiratory reserve, surgery may not be possible.|$|E
5|$|Many CAS family {{proteins}} {{have altered}} activity and functional roles in cancer progression and metastasis, with functional roles in influencing cellular adhesion, migration and drug resistance. Changes in CASS4 {{may also be}} associated with human malignancies. CASS4 function was linked to {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) in a study by Miao et al. that correlated elevated CASS4 expression with <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis and high TNM stage. In addition, this study detected a significant difference in cytoplasmic accumulation of CASS4 protein between high (H1299 and BE1) and low (LTE and A549) metastatic potential lung cancer cell lines. These may suggest CASS4 as a possible prognostic marker in clinical management of NSCLC.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess {{positivity}} nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in patients with macro, micro and submicrometastases in sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and find predictive factors of positivity nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Study was conducted at the Department of Surgery in Pardubice, Pilsen, Ostrava and Zlín. Sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were assessed based on standards of Czech Pathological Society. Detection of sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> was performed based on radionavigation or combination of radionavigation and blue dye method. In group N 1 (macrometastases) there was found positivity of nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in 50 % (45 from 90 patients). In group N 1 Mi (micrometastases) there was found positivity of nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in 26. 7 % (16 from 60 patients). In group NO I+ (sub-micrometastases) there was found positivity of nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in 6. 7 % (1 from 15 patients). Predictive factors were size of metastasis, number of positive sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and grading. Size of tumor was not found to be a predictive factor of positivity nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> High positivity of nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in pacients with macro and micrometastases in sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> advocates to perform axillary <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> dissection. Due to small number of patients with submicrometastases it is not possible to assess if axillary dissection is necessary or not. Predictive factors of positivity of nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> are size of metastasis in sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> number of positive sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and grading. Size of tumor was not found to be a predictive factor due to small tumors in the study. In spite of this it is necessary to consider it like a predictive factor of positivity nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> In patients with macro and micrometastases it is necessary to perform axillary dissection. In patients with submicrometastases in sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> it is necessary to consider predictive factors...|$|R
50|$|Cervical <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> are <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> {{found in}} the neck. Of the 800 <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in the human body, 300 are in the neck.Cervical <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> are subject {{to a number of}} {{different}} pathological conditions including tumours, infection and inflammation.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> the spleen and Peyer's patches, {{are known}} as {{secondary}} lymphoid organs. <b>Lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> are found between lymphatic ducts and blood vessels. Afferent lymphatic vessels bring lymph fluid from the peripheral tissues to the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> The <b>lymph</b> tissue in the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> consists of immune cells (95%), for example lymphocytes, and stromal cells (1% to 5%) The genesis of <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> begins within the blood and the lymphatic system. Interactions between stromal and hematopoietic cells are important {{for the development of}} <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Crosstalk LEC, lymphoid tissue inducer cells and mesenchymal stromal organizer cells initiate the formation of <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b>|$|R
25|$|If a <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> is positive, {{depending}} {{on the extent of}} <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> spread, a radical <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection will often be performed. If the disease is completely resected, the patient will be considered for adjuvant therapy.|$|E
25|$|The {{substance}} of a <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> consists of lymphoid follicles in an outer portion called the cortex. The inner {{portion of the}} node is called the medulla, which is surrounded by the cortex on all sides except for a portion known as the hilum. The hilum presents as a depression {{on the surface of}} the <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> causing the otherwise spherical <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> to be bean-shaped or ovoid. The efferent lymph vessel directly emerges from the <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> at the hilum. The arteries and veins supplying the <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> with blood enter and exit through the hilum.|$|E

25|$|Surgery {{involves}} the physical {{removal of the}} tumor, typically {{along with some of}} the surrounding tissue. One or more lymph nodes may be biopsied during the surgery; increasingly the <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> sampling is performed by a sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> biopsy.|$|E
25|$|One {{function}} of quantum dots is {{their use in}} <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> mapping, which is feasible due to their unique ability to emit light in the near infrared (NIR) region. <b>Lymph</b> <b>node</b> mapping allows surgeons to track if and where cancerous cells exist.|$|E

50|$|Rotter's <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> {{are small}} interpectoral <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> located between the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscles. They receive lymphatic fluid from the muscles and the mammary gland, and deliver lymphatic fluid to the {{axillary}} lymphatic plexus. These <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> {{are susceptible to}} breast cancer, as the cancer sometimes spreads (metastases) to the interpectoral <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Rotter's <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> are named after German surgeon Josef Rotter (1857-1924), who described them in the late 19th century.|$|R
50|$|The lymphatic vessels {{follow the}} arteries in a {{retrograde}} fashion. The anterior lymphatic vessels drain into the pancreatoduodenal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> located along the superior and inferior pancreatoduodenal arteries {{and then into}} the pyloric <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (along the gastroduodenal artery).The posterior lymphatic vessels pass posterior {{to the head of the}} pancreas and drain into the superior mesenteric <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Efferent lymphatic vessels from the duodenal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> ultimately pass into the celiac <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b>|$|R

25|$|X-rays, ultrasound, or <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> bone marrow, or organ biopsies may be {{necessary}} to stage the disease.|$|E
25|$|During the operation, {{the lymph}} nodes in the axilla are also {{considered}} for removal. In the past, large axillary operations took out 10 to 40 nodes to establish whether cancer had spread. This had the unfortunate side effect of frequently causing lymphedema of the arm on the same side, as the removal of this many lymph nodes affected lymphatic drainage. More recently, the technique of sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> (SLN) dissection has become popular, as it requires the removal of far fewer lymph nodes, resulting in fewer side effects while achieving the same 10-year survival as its predecessor. The sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> is the first node that drains the tumor, and subsequent SLN mapping can save 65-70% of patients with breast cancer from having a complete <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection for what {{could turn out to}} be a negative nodal basin. Advances in Sentinel <b>Lymph</b> <b>Node</b> mapping over the past decade have increased the accuracy of detecting Sentinel <b>Lymph</b> <b>Node</b> from 80% using blue dye alone to between 92% and 98% using combined modalities. SLN biopsy is indicated for patients with T1 and T2 lesions (<5nbsp&cm) and carries a number of recommendations for use on patient subgroups. Recent trends continue to favor less radical axillar node resection even in the presence of some metastases in the sentinel node.|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{studies on}} {{risk factors and}} metastatic rate of retropancreatic (number 13) <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in gastric {{adenocarcinoma}} were few {{and the results were}} still controversial. The aim {{of this study was to}} elucidate risk factors and prognostic significance of number 13 <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in gastric adenocarcinoma. Method. From January 2000 to December 2011, 114 patients who underwent gastrectomy with number 13 <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> dissection were enrolled and followed up to January 2014. Patients were grouped according to whether number 13 <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were positive or negative. Results. The metastatic rate of number 13 <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> was 22. 8 %. In multivariate analysis, pT stage (P= 0. 027), pN stage (P= 0. 005), and number 11 p (P= 0. 015) <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were independent risk factors of positive number 13 <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> In all patients (P< 0. 001) and subpopulation with TNM III stage (P= 0. 007), positive number 13 <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> had significantly worse prognosis than those of patients with negative number 13 LNs in Kaplan-Meier analysis. Conclusion. Number 13 <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> had relatively high metastatic rate and led to poor prognosis. pT stage, pN stage, and number 11 p <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were independent risk factors of positive number 13 <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes...</b>|$|R
