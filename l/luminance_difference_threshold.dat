On {{the basis of these}} general-type data, a procedure can be designed to find the maximum possible number of the distinguishable luminance levels between two given luminances for observers under a certain adaptation state. By taking the maximum number of levels as a measure of visibility, some predictions of interest have been made, such as better-arranged reflectances for the Munsell grey samples and the various ways in which illuminance contributes to visual communication.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of color contrast on luminance discrimination. Observers were required to indicate the more intense of two stimuli presented briefly in a surround. In some conditions the two stimuli were the same chromaticity as the surround, while in other conditions the stimuli differed in chromaticity from the surround. The luminance of the fixed test stimulus was varied in different conditions over a range from below the surround level to above the surround level. <b>Difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> were proportional to the <b>luminance</b> <b>difference</b> between test and surround over much of the range. However, <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> were higher at low luminance contrasts when the chromatic contrast between the stimuli and the surround was high. Results also indicate that the effects of chromatic contrast may be mediated by local contrast mechanisms, but that the relationship between threshold and luminance contrast is not mediated entirely by these local contrast mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|The {{intensity}} <b>difference</b> <b>threshold</b> {{is defined}} as ‘the difference in the intensity of two stimuli which is just sufficient for their difference to be detected’. The aim of this thesis is to advance understanding of the perception of vibration intensity differences in humans. In addition to increasing understanding of the tactile senses, knowledge of difference perception could inform various applications such as the optimisation of the vibration characteristics of vehicles and the design of human–machine interfaces involving communication via the sense of touch. Absolute thresholds for the perception of vibration in the glabrous skin have been modelled by ‘channels’ within the somatosensory system that predict the effects of vibration frequency, vibration magnitude, vibration duration and contact conditions. <b>Difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> are less well understood {{and there is little}} knowledge of their dependence on vibration characteristics and contact conditions. In this thesis, psychophysical methods were employed to determine the <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> with various input conditions (whole-body vibration, foot-transmitted vibration, grasping a vibrating handle, and localised excitation of the hand and the forearm). Five experiments investigated the dependence of <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> on vibration magnitude, vibration frequency, the responses of the somatosensory channels of the skin (especially the Pacinian and the non-Pacinian I channels) as well as the location of the vibration input, information from other sensory systems, and the presence of masking vibration. The first experiment tested the hypothesis that relative <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> (i. e. the percentage change in vibration magnitude required for the change to be detected) for vertical whole-body vibration depend on the frequency and magnitude of the vibration. Relative <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> were found to be independent of vibration magnitude except at the lowest frequency (2. 5 Hz) and the highest frequency (315 Hz), where the change in motion may have been perceived by vision and hearing, respectively. The second and third experiments investigated the dependence of <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> on the frequency and magnitude of hand-transmitted vibration and foot-transmitted vibration. The experiments produced similar results, with <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> independent of the frequency of vibration and only dependent on the magnitude of vibration at 125 Hz, where higher magnitudes (18 dB sensation level and above) produced greater relative <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds.</b> The fourth experiment tested the hypothesis that a low-magnitude low-frequency masking vibration (at 16 Hz) would not affect high-frequency <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> (at 125 Hz). It was found that the lowfrequency masker only increased <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> when its magnitude was greater than 12 dB SL. The final experiment with localised vibration at the hand and arm tested the hypothesis that NPI and P channels have different relative <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds.</b> Overall, {{there was no significant difference}} between the relative <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> of vibration mediated by the NPI channel (at 10 Hz) and the P-channel (at 125 Hz), but the relative <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> of the P-channel tended to be lower than those of the NPI-channel, as in experiments II and III. Depending on the test conditions, the median unmasked relative <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> were in a range from 0. 1 to 0. 6. There was a tendency for the relative <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> to decrease with increasing contact area, with whole-body vibration producing the smallest relative <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> and localised vibration producing the greatest relative <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds.</b> From the results of all five experiments, it was concluded that excitation area and cues from other senses were more likely to cause relative <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> to depend on the frequency and magnitude of vibration, than any differences in discrimination capability between the P and NPI channels. Other findings include a possible reduction in the discrimination capability of the P-channel with increasing magnitude of vibration (in Experiments II and III) and the suggestion of lower relative differencethresholds for the NPII channel (in Experiment V) ...|$|R

It was hypothesised that relative intensity <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> (i. e. Weber fractions) for 16 -Hz vibration mediated by the non-Pacinian I (NPI) channel would differ from relative intensity <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> for 125 -Hz vibration mediated by the Pacinian (P) channel. Absolute <b>thresholds,</b> <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds,</b> and the locations of vibration sensation caused by vertical vibration of the right foot were determined for 12 subjects using the up-down-transformed-response method together with the three-down-one-up rule. The <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> and locations of sensation were obtained at six reference magnitudes (at 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30 dB above absolute threshold—i. e. sensation levels, SL). For 16 -Hz vibration, the median relative <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> were not significantly dependent on vibration magnitude and were in the range 0. 19 (at 30 dB SL) to 0. 27 (at 9 dB SL). For 125 -Hz vibration, the median relative <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> varied between 0. 17 (at 9 dB SL) and 0. 34 (at 30 dB SL), with <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> from 6 to 12 dB SL significantly less than those from 18 to 30 dB SL. At vibration magnitudes slightly in excess of absolute thresholds (i. e. 6 – 12 dB SL) {{there were no significant}} differences between Weber fractions obtained from the P channel (at 125 Hz) and the NPI channel (at 16 Hz). At 24 and 30 dB SL, the 125 -Hz Weber fractions were significantly greater than the 16 -Hz Weber fractions. Differences in the 125 -Hz Weber fractions may have been caused by a reduction in the discriminability of the P channel at high levels of excitation, resulting in one or more NP channel mediating the <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> at magnitudes greater than 18 dB SL. At high magnitudes, a change of channel mediating the Weber fractions may have been responsible for different Weber fractions with 16 - and 125 -Hz vibration. <br/...|$|R

The CFM stimulus that we used consisted of a field of colored, randomly positioned dots on a bright achromatic background. The dots in the target region were different {{from those in the}} surround in chromaticity or luminance (or both). The stimulus consists of multiple frames, identical except that the color assignments of some dots are changed from frame to frame.

Color normal individuals can see CFM in displays with dots differing only in chromaticity or only in luminance. The subject's task was to indicate the perceived direction of motion of the target region, under conditions that varied the trajectory of the target. The test was validated in two main ways.

The up-down-transformed-response method with a three-down-one-up rule provided absolute <b>thresholds</b> and also <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> at various levels above the absolute thresholds of 12 subjects (i. e., sensation levels, SLs) selected to activate preferentially either single channels or multiple channels. Median <b>difference</b> <b>thresholds</b> varied from 0. 20 (thenar eminence with 125 -Hz vibration at 10 ?dB SL) to 0. 58 (thenar eminence with 10 -Hz vibration at 20 ?dB SL).

To {{investigate}} the variation of retinal electrophysiological function in glaucoma {{by using the}} global flash multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) stimulation with altered differences in the stimulus luminance of the multifocal flashes, {{in an attempt to}} alter the levels of inner retinal contributions. METHODS. The mfERG was assessed with a visual stimulus in steps of four video frames, which consisted of 103 scaled hexagonal elements followed by a dark frame, global flash, and dark frame. The localized <b>luminance</b> <b>difference</b> was set at 96 %, 65 %, 49 %, or 29 % stimulus contrast. Thirty subjects with glaucoma and 30 age-matched normal subjects were recruited for visual field and mfERG measurements. RESULTS. This stimulus induces complex local first-order responses with an early direct component (DC) and a later induced component (IC). The luminance-modulated response functions of the DC and IC responses showed markedly different behavior. The peripheral IC showed a linear dependence on <b>luminance</b> <b>difference,</b> whereas the peripheral DC was saturated for higher <b>luminance</b> <b>differences.</b> This saturation became less obvious in subjects with glaucoma, mostly because of greater reduction of the response amplitude in the mid luminance-difference level. An "adaptive index" was calculated from the luminance-difference dependence of the peripheral DC, and it showed a sensitivity of 93 %, with a specificity of 95 % for differentiating normal from glaucomatous eyes, and also had a significant correlation (r = 0. 58) with the glaucomatous visual field defect. CONCLUSIONS. The peripheral DC luminance-modulated response function is altered by the adaptive mechanism that is induced by the global flash; the reduction of the adaptive index may thus relate to an abnormal adaptive mechanism, presumably due to inner retinal damage. Glaucoma appears to produce large reductions of the adaptive index which correlate with field defects. School of Optometr...|$|R

However, Study 6 showed that the long-range dependence in fluctuation patterns of luminance across the lengths of movies has been quite varied but is unchanged over roughly this same period.|$|R

Th 2 {{represents the}} proportion of the edge component in a block. Briefly, Th 1 and Th 2 represent {{the quality and quantity of}} the edge component, respectively. If a certain block satisfies the above decision formula D, we decide that the block is an edge block. Each extracted edge block is denoted as E [...]...|$|R
