5|$|Giant mouse <b>lemurs</b> {{are often}} {{sympatric}} with mouse <b>lemurs,</b> such as M.murinus, {{though they are}} typically found higher in the canopy and favor thicker, taller gallery forests. At the Marosalaza forest (north of Morondava), Coquerel's giant mouse lemur is sympatric with four other nocturnal <b>lemurs</b> (mouse <b>lemurs,</b> sportive <b>lemurs,</b> dwarf <b>lemurs,</b> and fork-marked <b>lemurs),</b> but manages niche differentiation by feeding at different times and specializing on insect secretions during the dry season.|$|E
5|$|The {{gestation}} period varies within <b>lemurs,</b> ranging from 9 weeks in mouse <b>lemurs</b> and 9–10weeks in dwarf <b>lemurs</b> to 18–24weeks in other <b>lemurs.</b> The smaller, nocturnal <b>lemurs,</b> such as mouse <b>lemurs,</b> giant mouse <b>lemurs,</b> and dwarf <b>lemurs,</b> usually {{give birth to}} more than one infant, whereas the larger, nocturnal <b>lemurs,</b> such as fork-marked <b>lemurs,</b> sportive <b>lemurs,</b> and the aye-aye usually have one offspring. Dwarf and mouse <b>lemurs</b> have up to four offspring, but both average only two. Ruffed <b>lemurs</b> are the only large, diurnal <b>lemurs</b> to consistently give birth to two or three offspring. All other <b>lemurs</b> have single births. Multiple births in <b>lemurs</b> are normally fraternal, and are known to occur in every five to six births in species such as the ring-tailed lemur and some Eulemur.|$|E
5|$|After the {{offspring}} are born, <b>lemurs</b> either carry them around or stash them while foraging. When transported, the infants either {{cling to the}} mother's fur or are carried in the mouth by the scruff. In some species, such as bamboo <b>lemurs,</b> infants are carried by mouth until {{they are able to}} cling to their mother's fur. Species that park their offspring include nocturnal species (e.g. mouse <b>lemurs,</b> sportive <b>lemurs,</b> and dwarf <b>lemurs),</b> bamboo <b>lemurs,</b> and ruffed <b>lemurs.</b> In the case of the ruffed <b>lemurs,</b> the young are altricial and the mothers build nests for them, much like the smaller, nocturnal lemur species. Woolly <b>lemurs</b> are unusual for nocturnal <b>lemurs</b> because they live in cohesive family groups and carry their single offspring with them rather than parking them. Alloparenting (multiple or group parenting) has been reported in all lemur families except the sportive <b>lemurs</b> and aye-aye. Allonursing is also known to occur in several lemur groups. Even males have been observed caring for infants in species such as the red-bellied lemur, mongoose lemur, eastern lesser bamboo lemur, silky sifaka, fat-tailed dwarf lemur, and ruffed <b>lemurs.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} lesser bamboo <b>lemur</b> (Hapalemur meridionalis), {{also known}} as the southern bamboo <b>lemur,</b> rusty-gray bamboo <b>lemur,</b> and southern gentle <b>lemur,</b> is species of bamboo <b>lemur</b> endemic to southern Madagascar.|$|R
50|$|Black <b>lemur</b> (Eulemur macaco), red-bellied <b>lemur</b> (Eulemur rubriventer), weasel {{sportive}} <b>lemur</b> (Lepilemur mustelinus), eastern woolly <b>lemur</b> (Avahi laniger), diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema).|$|R
5000|$|The {{only other}} Eulemur species that occurs {{within the range}} of the black <b>lemur</b> is the common brown <b>lemur,</b> which {{overlaps}} with the black <b>lemur</b> at the extreme southern and eastern edge of its range, and the red-bellied <b>lemur,</b> on the Tsaratanana Massif. [...] The common brown <b>lemur</b> and the red-bellied <b>lemur</b> have different coloration and do not show the extreme sexual dimorphism of the black <b>lemur,</b> making confusion between the black <b>lemur</b> and the other species unlikely.|$|R
5|$|Based on {{similarities}} in their skull and teeth, {{it was later}} thought that monkey <b>lemurs</b> (Hadropithecus and Archaeolemur) were a sister group to the living indriids and the recently extinct sloth <b>lemurs</b> (family Palaeopropithecidae). However, there was some debate over whether the monkey <b>lemurs</b> or the sloth <b>lemurs</b> were {{more closely related to}} today's indriids. The monkey <b>lemurs</b> had skulls that more closely resembled the indriids, but their teeth were very specialized and unlike those of the indriids. The sloth <b>lemurs,</b> on the other hand, had teeth like the indriids, but very specialized skulls. The matter was settled with the discovery of new skeletons of Babakotia and Mesopropithecus, two genera of sloth lemur, both of which had indriid-like skulls and teeth. More recently, postcranial remains of Hadropithecus found in the early 2000s prompted the suggestion that the monkey <b>lemurs</b> were more closely related to the lemurids. However, DNA sequencing has reaffirmed the sister group status of the monkey <b>lemurs</b> to indriids and sloth <b>lemurs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Based on {{studies using}} morphology, immunology, {{repetitive}} DNA, SINE analysis, multilocus phylogenetic tests, and mitochondrial genes (mtDNA), giant mouse <b>lemurs</b> are most {{closely related to}} mouse <b>lemurs</b> within the family Cheirogaleidae, and together they form a clade with the hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus). Both dwarf <b>lemurs</b> and fork-marked <b>lemurs</b> are more distantly related, with fork-marked <b>lemurs</b> being either a sister group of all cheirogaleids, or {{more closely related to}} sportive <b>lemurs</b> (Lepilemur).|$|E
5|$|Classifications in {{the first}} half of the 20th century divided <b>lemurs</b> into three families: Daubentoniidae, Indriidae, and Lemuridae, with the latter {{including}} the current Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae. Because of concerns that Lemuridae might not be monophyletic, the family was later split; in 1982 Tattersall separated the Cheirogaleidae for the dwarf <b>lemurs,</b> mouse <b>lemurs</b> and relatives, and the Lepilemuridae for the sportive <b>lemurs</b> and bamboo <b>lemurs</b> (including the greater bamboo lemur). This classification is still used, except that the bamboo <b>lemurs</b> were moved back to Lemuridae.|$|E
50|$|The fat-tailed dwarf <b>lemur</b> (Cheirogaleus medius), {{also known}} as the lesser dwarf <b>lemur,</b> western fat-tailed dwarf <b>lemur,</b> or spiny forest dwarf <b>lemur,</b> is endemic to Madagascar.|$|R
5000|$|The western lesser bamboo <b>lemur</b> (Hapalemur occidentalis), {{also known}} as the {{northern}} bamboo <b>lemur</b> or western gentle <b>lemur,</b> is species of bamboo <b>lemur</b> endemic to Madagascar.|$|R
5|$|In 2008, the red <b>lemur,</b> Eulemur rufus, {{was split}} into two species, Eulemur rufus (red <b>lemur)</b> and Eulemur rufifrons (red-fronted <b>lemur).</b> Also, Eulemur rufus was {{previously}} known as the red-fronted <b>lemur,</b> but was renamed the red <b>lemur,</b> while Eulemur rufifrons assumed its former name.|$|R
5|$|Crypsis, or the {{inability}} of humans to visually distinguish between two or more distinct species, has recently been discovered among <b>lemurs,</b> particularly within the sportive <b>lemurs</b> (Lepilemur) and mouse <b>lemurs</b> (Microcebus). With sportive <b>lemurs,</b> subspecies were traditionally defined based on slight morphological differences, but new genetic evidence has supported giving full species status to these regional populations. In the case of mouse <b>lemurs,</b> the gray mouse lemur (M. murinus), golden-brown mouse lemur (M. ravelobensis), and Goodman's mouse lemur (M. lehilahytsara) were considered the same species until recently, when genetic tests identified them as cryptic species.|$|E
5|$|Family Cheirogaleidae {{consists}} of the mouse <b>lemurs</b> (smallest of all primates), the dwarf <b>lemurs,</b> and the fork-marked <b>lemurs</b> and their allies. There are 37extant species.|$|E
5|$|Family Lemuridae {{consists}} of the ring-tailed lemur, the brown <b>lemurs,</b> the bamboo <b>lemurs</b> and the ruffed <b>lemurs.</b> There are 21extant species and six subspecies.|$|E
50|$|The golden-brown mouse <b>lemur</b> (Microcebus ravelobensis), {{also known}} as the Lac Ravelobe mouse <b>lemur</b> or the Ravelobe mouse <b>lemur,</b> is part of the family, Cheirogaleidae. These are the {{smallest}} species of <b>lemur</b> and are all arboreal, nocturnal, and typically social. All species of <b>Lemur</b> are native to the island of Madagascar. The golden-brown mouse <b>lemur,</b> Microcebus ravelobensis, was first discovered in 1994.|$|R

50|$|Coquerel's giant mouse <b>lemur</b> (Mirza coquereli), {{also known}} as Coquerel's dwarf <b>lemur</b> or the {{southern}} giant mouse <b>lemur,</b> is a small nocturnal <b>lemur</b> endemic to Madagascar. This species was named after the French entomologist Charles Coquerel. This <b>lemur</b> {{can be found in}} parts of the Madagascar dry deciduous forests.|$|R
5|$|From the 1970s to the 1990s, {{there have}} been {{suggestions}} that the ruffed <b>lemurs</b> {{might be related to}} indriids or a sister group to Lemuridae and Indriidae and that the bamboo <b>lemurs</b> are related to the sportive <b>lemurs,</b> but neither view is supported by molecular phylogeny. The sportive <b>lemurs</b> and the extinct koala <b>lemurs</b> (Megaladapidae) both lack upper incisors in the permanent dentition, and in 1981, Groves placed both together in the family Megaladapidae, which he renamed Lepilemuridae in 2005 because that older name takes precedence. Genetic research does not support a close relationship between the sportive and koala <b>lemurs</b> and instead places the koala <b>lemurs</b> as a sister group to Lemuridae; therefore, the two are now placed in separate families (Lepilemuridae for the sportive <b>lemurs</b> and Megaladapidae for the koala <b>lemurs).</b> The sloth <b>lemurs</b> (Palaeopropithecidae) and monkey <b>lemurs</b> (Archaeolemuridae) were classified as subfamilies within Indriidae as late as 1982, but are now recognized as separate families.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the larger}} lemur species consume leaves (folivory), {{particularly}} the indriids. However, some smaller <b>lemurs</b> such as sportive <b>lemurs</b> (genus Lepilemur) and woolly <b>lemurs</b> (genus Avahi) also primarily eat leaves, making them the smallest primates that do so. The smallest of the <b>lemurs</b> generally do not eat much leaf matter. Collectively, <b>lemurs</b> have been documented consuming leaves from at least 82 native plant families and 15 alien plant families. <b>Lemurs</b> tend to be selective in their consumption of {{the part of the}} leaf or shoot as well as its age. Often, young leaves are preferred over mature leaves.|$|E
5|$|The {{calls of}} ruffed <b>lemurs</b> vary only {{slightly}} {{between the two}} species. In fact, in captivity, {{it has been documented}} that red ruffed <b>lemurs</b> understand and even join in the alarm calls of black-and-white ruffed <b>lemurs.</b> One minor difference between the vocal repertoires of these two species is in the pulse rate and frequency of the pulsed squawk, which is much faster and higher in red ruffed <b>lemurs</b> than in black-and-white ruffed <b>lemurs.</b> The difference in this vocalization is only interspecific, showing no signs of significant sexual dimorphism within each species.|$|E
5000|$|The red <b>lemur</b> (Eulemur rufus), {{also known}} as the rufous brown <b>lemur</b> or {{northern}} red-fronted <b>lemur,</b> is a species of <b>lemur</b> from Madagascar. Until 2001, the species E. rufus was considered a subspecies of the common brown <b>lemur,</b> E. fulvus, after which it was classified as its own species. In December 2008, the species was split into two separate species, the red <b>lemur,</b> E. rufus, distributed in dry lowland forests in northwestern Madagascar, and the red-fronted <b>lemur,</b> E. rufifrons, distributed in southwest and eastern Madagascar. [...] The species split was based on genetic and morphological evidence. [...] Mitochondrial DNA analysis indicates that E. rufifrons may be more closely related to the Common Brown <b>Lemur</b> (E. fulvus), white-headed <b>lemur</b> (E. albifrons) and Sanford's brown <b>lemur</b> (E. sanfordi) than it is to E. rufus.|$|R
50|$|Hawks' {{sportive}} <b>lemur</b> (Lepilemur tymerlachsoni), {{also known}} as the Nosy Be sportive <b>lemur</b> or Nosy Be weasel <b>lemur,</b> is a sportive <b>lemur</b> endemic to Madagascar. It is a moderately large sportive <b>lemur,</b> with a total length of about 50 to 68 centimeters, of which 22 to 27 centimeters are tail.|$|R
5000|$|The AEECL's {{sportive}} <b>lemur,</b> Antafia sportive <b>lemur</b> or red-shouldered sportive <b>lemur</b> (Lepilemur aeeclis) is a sportive <b>lemur</b> {{endemic to}} Madagascar. It has a total length of about 52 to 59 centimeters, of which 24-26 centimeters are tail. [...] AEECL's sportive <b>lemur</b> {{is found in}} western Madagascar, living in dry deciduous forests.|$|R
5|$|A {{small group}} of {{collared}} brown <b>lemurs</b> {{was introduced in the}} 1980s into the Berenty Private Reserve and has since hybridized with introduced red-fronted <b>lemurs.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} 2009 of seven {{mitochondrial}} genes (mtDNA) and three nuclear genes grouped fork-marked <b>lemurs</b> with sportive <b>lemurs</b> (family Lepilemuridae), offering {{a host of}} explanations, such as a possible hybridization (introgression) following the initial split between the families. A study published in 2013 also grouped fork-marked <b>lemurs</b> with sportive <b>lemurs</b> when it used 43morphological traits and mtDNA. If correct, this would make the family Cheirogaleidae paraphyletic. Broad agreement between two lemur phylogeny studies—one in 2004 using SINE analysis and another in 2012 using multilocus phylogenetic tests—gave strong support for a sister group relationship between fork-marked <b>lemurs</b> {{and the rest of}} the cheirogaleids and a more distant relationship with sportive <b>lemurs.</b> The split between Phaner {{and the rest of the}} cheirogaleids is thought to have occurred approximately 38mya (million years ago), not long after the radiation of most of the major lemur groups on Madagascar, roughly 43mya.|$|E
5|$|All <b>lemurs,</b> {{particularly}} the smaller species, {{are affected by}} predation and they are important prey items for predators. Humans are the most significant predator of diurnal <b>lemurs,</b> despite taboos that occasionally forbid the hunting and eating of certain lemur species. Other predators include native euplerids, such as the fossa, feral cats, domestic dogs, snakes, diurnal birds of prey, owls, and crocodiles. Extinct giant eagles, including one or two species from the genus Aquila and the giant Malagasy crowned eagle (Stephanoaetus mahery), {{as well as the}} giant fossa (Cryptoprocta spelea), previously also preyed on <b>lemurs,</b> perhaps including the giant subfossil <b>lemurs</b> or their subadult offspring. The existence of these extinct giants suggests that predator-prey interactions involving <b>lemurs</b> were more complex than they are today. Today, predator size only restricts owls to the smaller <b>lemurs,</b> usually 100g (3.5oz) or less, while the larger <b>lemurs</b> fall victim to the larger diurnal birds of prey, such as the Madagascan harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus) and the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus).|$|E
50|$|The {{black-and-white}} ruffed <b>lemur</b> {{is one of}} {{two species}} in the genus Varecia, the other being the red ruffed <b>lemur</b> (V. rubra). Three subspecies are recognized: the white-belted black-and-white ruffed <b>lemur</b> (V. v. subcincta), the southern black-and-white ruffed <b>lemur</b> (V. v. editorum), and the black-and-white ruffed <b>lemur</b> (V. v. variegata, the nominate subspecies).|$|R
50|$|The gray-backed {{sportive}} <b>lemur</b> (Lepilemur dorsalis), {{also known}} as Gray's sportive <b>lemur</b> or back-striped sportive <b>lemur,</b> is a species of <b>lemur</b> in the family Lepilemuridae. It is endemic to Madagascar. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} {{restricted}} to the reserve of Andohahela and the area of Sainte Luce. Further studies are required to determine the exact distribution range and especially the limits with its sister species Peyrieras' woolly <b>lemur</b> (A. peyrierasi). In southeastern littoral forests, sympatric <b>lemur</b> species of Avahi meridionalis are the brown mouse <b>lemur</b> (Microcebus rufus), the greater dwarf <b>lemur</b> (Cheirogaleus major), the fat-tailed dwarf <b>lemur</b> Cheirogaleus medius and the collared brown <b>lemur</b> (Eulemur collaris) in Sainte Luce Forest, and the southern lesser bamboo <b>lemur</b> (Hapalemur meridionalis) in Mandena Forest.|$|R
5|$|Although not as {{significant}} as deforestation and hunting, some <b>lemurs,</b> such as crowned <b>lemurs</b> and other species that have successfully been kept in captivity, are occasionally kept as exotic pets by Malagasy people. Bamboo <b>lemurs</b> are also kept as pets, although they only survive {{for up to two}} months. Live capture for the exotic pet trade in wealthier countries is not normally considered a threat due to strict regulations controlling their export.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they lack}} a fovea, some diurnal <b>lemurs</b> have a cone-rich, {{although}} less clustered, area centralis. This area centralis {{has a high}} rod-to-cone cell ratio in many diurnal species studied thus far, whereas diurnal anthropoids have no rod cells in their fovea. Once again, this suggests lower visual acuity in <b>lemurs</b> than in anthropoids. Furthermore, the rod-to-cone cell ratio can be variable even among diurnal species. For instance, Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) and the indri (Indri indri) {{have only a few}} large cones scattered along their predominantly rod-dominated retina. The eyes of the ring-tailed lemur contain one cone to five rods. Nocturnal <b>lemurs</b> such as mouse <b>lemurs</b> and dwarf <b>lemurs,</b> on the other hand, have retinas made up entirely of rod cells.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{three-quarters of}} all extant strepsirrhine species are nocturnal, {{sleeping}} in nests made from dead leaves or tree hollows during the day. All of the lorisoids from continental Africa and Asia are nocturnal, a circumstance that minimizes their {{competition with the}} simian primates of the region, which are diurnal. The <b>lemurs</b> of Madagascar, living {{in the absence of}} simians, are more variable in their activity cycles. The aye-aye, mouse <b>lemurs,</b> woolly <b>lemurs,</b> and sportive <b>lemurs</b> are nocturnal, while ring-tailed <b>lemurs</b> and most of their kin, sifakas, and indri are diurnal. Yet {{some or all of the}} brown <b>lemurs</b> (Eulemur) are cathemeral, which means that they may be active during the day or night, depending on factors such as temperature and predation. Many extant strepsirrhines are well adapted for nocturnal activity due to their relatively large eyes; large, movable ears; sensitive tactile hairs; strong sense of smell; and the tapetum lucidum behind the retina. Among the adapiforms, most are considered diurnal, with the exception of Pronycticebus and Godinotia from Middle Eocene Europe, both of which had large orbits that suggest nocturnality.|$|E
