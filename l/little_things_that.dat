500|$|... "One of {{the most}} {{important}} things we were looking for in casting was the actors' ability to play the subtleties – the <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> a character doesn't say or do that create the edge, the things that get under your skin and spook you," [...] Morgan said about the auditions.|$|E
500|$|He talked {{openly in}} the music press about his problems, telling the NME: [...] "When I cut myself I feel so much better. All the <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> might have been {{annoying}} me seem so trivial because I'm concentrating on the pain", and [...] "I'm {{the sort of person}} who wakes up in the morning and needs to pour a bottle down my throat".|$|E

[...] "And it's this {{principle}} of steps, of degrees, {{of having to}} do this <b>little</b> <b>thing,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>that</b> keeps funerals from killing the survivors. I suppose this is worse than a funeral--look {{at it in the}} right light. You mourn as one without hope, don't you? Live through it too, I suppose." ...|$|R
500|$|Lady Bracknell's line, [...] "A handbag?", {{has been}} {{called one of the}} most {{malleable}} in English drama, lending itself to interpretations ranging from incredulous or scandalised to baffled. Edith Evans, both on stage and in the 1952 film, delivered the line loudly in a mixture of horror, incredulity and condescension. Stockard Channing, in the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin in 2010, hushed the line, in a critic's words, [...] "with a barely audible 'A handbag?', rapidly swallowed up with a sharp intake of breath. An understated take, to be sure, but with such a well-known play, packed full of witticisms and aphorisms with a life of their own, it's the <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> make a difference." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Box" [...] was co-written by co-executive {{producer}} Josh Singer {{and executive}} story editor Graham Roland, while being directed by [...] veteran Jeffrey Hunt. The episode {{was shot in}} the second half of July 2010. Hunt later tweeted on-set photos in January 2011. At San Diego Comic-Con International during the summer leading up to the season premiere, actress Jasika Nicole told the audience they would finally be able to see her character's apartment, which has previously been only alluded to in an early season two episode. She explained, [...] "It's really neat! [...] There's all these tiny <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> give you insight into how things are. [...] I know the color of (Astrid's) walls, so watch out!" ...|$|E
500|$|Nagarjuna {{added that}} the film's {{characters}} would reborn with no special purpose unlike other reincarnation films like Janaki Ramudu (1988), Arundhati (2009) and Magadheera (2009). Saran {{said in an interview}} that the film basically has a family-oriented theme and is about falling in love with [...] "small, <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> you sort of don't see every day, but are really, really important". Unlike other reincarnation based films, the film's story develops two separate themes— the relationship between reborn lovers, but also the relationship between reborn parents and their children. Naga Chaitanya acknowledged in an interview with The Hindu that the film's script might seem to have a few overly-convenient coincidences, but felt that Kumar's detailing in every scene made the script believable.|$|E

500|$|Alan Sepinwall {{praised the}} episode {{compared}} to the first few episodes of the season, writing it balanced Veronica's character traits well, including her jealousy and generosity. He also wrote that it showed her as a character with some [...] "baser instincts", giving the scene with Jeff as an example. Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, gave a mixed review. The reviewer was very critical {{of what he called}} the [...] "'radical feminist fakes her own rape'" [...] storyline, but he praised the episode as the first one of the third season to make the college setting feel natural. Although he thought that the case-of-the-week contributed to his overall positive view of the episode, he thought that [...] "it's mostly the <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> make it work", pointing out Piz's increased role as an example.|$|E
500|$|Stevens' {{teams are}} built around solid {{basketball}} fundamentals and good team work, rather than individual basketball skill. His teams {{are known for}} their defense, forcing opponents into uncharacteristic mistakes. The secret to basketball – and life – is [...] "just to do the job {{to the best of your}} ability and don't worry about anything else," [...] Stevens says. [...] "Win the next game. Win the next possession. That's our focus. It's boring. It's also the way championships are won", he says. In short, Stevens is a strong believer in [...] "The Butler Way" [...] – doing all the <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> transform a group of good basketball players into a great basketball team. [...] "I tell the players 'the Butler Way' isn't easy to define," [...] Stevens says, [...] "but you can see it on the floor when we share the basketball, play with great energy and defend." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava and was shot in black-and-white in New York City with the video for [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". A Spanish version of the music video, titled [...] "Si Yo Fuera Un Chico", was released with the same concepts as the main one; it was edited from the original with the Spanish version of the song dubbed over it. The music video for [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] is reflective of the stance as an independent woman that Beyoncé has taken throughout her career. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé revealed {{that the concept of}} the video is similar to the American comedy film Freaky Friday (1976); its theme is role reversal. She also said that it would depict things that men commonly do to hurt their partners, like not answering their phones, before adding that the video is about <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> mean a lot in relationships. Beyoncé explained: ...|$|E

500|$|The abuse {{he faced}} {{at the hands}} of opponents early in his NHL career {{prompted}} Iginla's coaches to work at developing his physical play. While he was not enthusiastic about fighting, Iginla accepted then head coach Brian Sutter's arguments that he needed to adopt a more aggressive style to improve as a player. Iginla is most effective when he has room to manoeuvre, and to create that space, he had to intimidate his opponents. The lessons Iginla learned have carried throughout his career. [...] "You've got a power forward who does it all," [...] said Craig Conroy. [...] "I mean, he'll fight, and hit, and score goals. Maybe it's not the end-to-end rushes, but he does all those <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> win games and get things done." [...] His opponents also respect his play. Rob Blake said that while Iginla is not known for fancy play, [...] "he'll run you over. Or he'll fight somebody. And then he'll score a goal. He does pretty much everything you'd want a guy to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, {{he was the}} Editor-at-Large for Faber and Faber, and Singing {{from the}} Floor by JP Bean is his first acquisition. Cocker {{explained}} to NME: [...] "Singing from the Floor portrays an important movement in vernacular culture in {{the voices of the}} people who made it happen – and that's not an easy task ... JP Bean has captured this moment before it is lost forever, and has made it live again on the page. He's a very clever chap. Let's raise a glass to him." [...] Cocker says he writes about 'the <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> stick in your mind' because most of them are 'eternal'.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{the song}}'s release, Lorde teased the song on her Twitter account, saying [...] the [...] "Green Light" [...] would be [...] "different, and kinda unexpected. Complex and funny and sad and joyous and it'll make you DANCE." [...] Lorde {{announced}} {{the release of}} the single and its music video on Twitter on 2 March 2017. Later that day, in a Beats 1 interview with Zane Lowe, she also said: The song is really about those moments kind of immediately after your life changes and about all the silly <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> you gravitate towards. I say, 'She thinks you love the beach, you're such a liar.' What the fuck, she thinks you like the beach?! You don't like the beach! It's those little stupid things. It sounds so happy and then the lyrics are so intense obviously. And I realized I was like, 'how come this thing is coming out so joyous sounding?' And I realized this is that drunk girl at the party dancing around crying about her ex-boyfriend who everyone thinks is a mess. That's her tonight and tomorrow she starts to rebuild. And that's the song for me.|$|E

60|$|This made me, I dare say, more timid and {{retiring}} than I naturally was {{and cast}} me upon Dolly {{as the only}} friend with whom I felt at ease. But something happened when I was still quite a <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> helped it very much.|$|R
6000|$|... "Both {{my brother}} chiefs are wise," [...] said Makitok. [...] "Let it be done, {{and let him}} take the laws out of the <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> speaks to him." [...] (Thus they {{referred}} to the Bible, having no word in their language by which to name it.) ...|$|R
2500|$|Before {{he pitched}} {{the idea to}} ABC, other titles for the show {{included}} 40 and Single and The Courteney Cox Show, which was eventually named Cougar Town because Lawrence thought that [...] "the title is noisy and that people will be aware of this show". He felt {{that the risk of}} the title was that the audience wouldn't watch it because people would say [...] "the title bums me", commenting: [...] "it's a risky roll of the dice ... We don't call women 'cougars' in it. We certainly don't use the word beyond the unbelievably big cheat that the high school mascot is a cougar." [...] Lawrence believed that with the subsequent scripts they'd be doing and the reshoots in the pilot, the show would be [...] "creatively satisfying". After he pitched the idea to ABC, they asked him to have a pilot ready to shoot by the end of January 2009. Lawrence and Biegel together wrote the script with Lawrence, who has written and directed many episodes on Scrubs, directing the episode. In casting beyond Cox, Lawrence created the character of Ellie for his wife, Christa Miller. Miller felt that her character started off [...] "gleefully" [...] and reported that Lawrence would write down <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> she would say.|$|E
2500|$|On October 10, 1943, O'Hare flew with VF-6 {{again in}} the air strikes against Wake Island. On this mission Lt.(jg) Alex Vraciu, the future ace, was his wingman - both Butch and Vraciu scored that day. When they came across an enemy {{formation}} Butch took the outside airplane and Vraciu took the inside plane. Butch went below the clouds to get a Japanese Mitsubishi Zero and Vraciu lost him, so Vraciu {{kept an eye on}} a second Zero that went to Wake Island and landed. Vraciu strafed the Zero on the ground, then saw a Betty bomber and shot it down. Upon returning to the carrier, O'Hare asked Vraciu where he went and Vraciu knew then that he should have definitely stayed with his leader. Alex Vraciu later told after the war, [...] "O'Hare taught many of the squadron members <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> would later save their lives. One example was to swivel your neck before starting a strafing run to make sure enemy fighters were not on your tail." [...] Vraciu also learned from O'Hare the [...] "highside pass" [...] used for attacking the Japanese Mitsubishi G4M Betty bombers. The highside technique was used to avoid the lethal 20-mm fire of the Betty's tail gunner. The Wake Island raid would be the last occasion Butch would lead VF-6 in battle. According to orders dated September 17, 1943, October found Butch O'Hare as Commander Air Group (CAG) commanding Air Group Six, embarked on the famous [...] Functioning as CAG, O'Hare was given command of the entire Enterprise air group: Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters, Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers, Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers and 100 pilots.|$|E

60|$|In this {{delightful}} way of living, {{only one}} thing troubled us. We didn't save any money.

60|$|Money {{poured in}} on him, fame poured in on him; he flashed, comet-like, {{through the world}} of literature, and he was more amused than {{interested}} by the stir he was making. One thing was puzzling him, a <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> would have puzzled the world had it known. But the world would have puzzled over his bepuzzlement rather than over the <b>little</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> to him loomed gigantic. Judge Blount invited him to dinner. <b>That</b> was the <b>little</b> <b>thing,</b> or {{the beginning of the}} <b>little</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>that</b> was soon to become the big thing. He had insulted Judge Blount, treated him abominably, and Judge Blount, meeting him on the street, invited him to dinner. Martin bethought himself of the numerous occasions on which he had met Judge Blount at the Morses' and when Judge Blount had not invited him to dinner. Why had he not invited him to dinner then? he asked himself. He had not changed. He was the same Martin Eden. What made the difference? The fact that the stuff he had written had appeared inside the covers of books? But it was work performed. It was not something he had done since. It was achievement accomplished at the very time Judge Blount was sharing this general view and sneering at his Spencer and his intellect. Therefore it was not for any real value, but for a purely fictitious value that Judge Blount invited him to dinner.|$|R
