40|$|The {{development}} of siRNA-based gene silencing therapies has significant potential for effectively treating debilitating genetic, hyper-proliferative or malignant skin conditions caused by aberrant gene expression. To be efficacious and widely accepted by physicians and patients, therapeutic siRNAs must access the viable skin layers {{in a stable}} and functional form, preferably without painful administration. In this study we explore the use of minimally-invasive steel microneedle devices to effectively deliver siRNA into skin. A simple, yet precise microneedle coating method permitted reproducible loading of siRNA onto individual microneedles. Following recovery from the microneedle surface, lamin A/C siRNA retained full activity, as demonstrated by significant reduction in lamin A/C mRNA levels and reduced lamin A/C protein in HaCaT keratinocyte cells. However, lamin A/C siRNA pre-complexed with a commercial <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection</b> <b>reagent</b> (siRNA lipoplex) was less functional following microneedle coating. As Accell-modified "self-delivery" siRNA targeted against CD 44 also retained functionality after microneedle coating, this form of siRNA was used in subsequent in vivo studies, where gene silencing was determined in a transgenic reporter mouse skin model. Self-delivery siRNA targeting the reporter (luciferase/GFP) gene was coated onto microneedles and delivered to mouse footpad. Quantification of reporter mRNA and intravital imaging of reporter expression in the outer skin layers confirmed functional in vivo gene silencing following microneedle delivery of siRNA. The use of coated metal microneedles represents a new, simple, minimally-invasive, patient-friendly and potentially self-administrable method for the delivery of therapeutic nucleic acids to the skin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Peptide {{surfactants}} {{developed in}} the Centre for Biomolecular Engineering at The University of Queensland are engineered to combine the advantages of traditional surfactants with biodegradability, biocompatibility, formation of a mechanically strong interfacial cohesive network, and reversible stimuli-responsiveness. In this project, the potential of peptide-stabilised emulsions as delivery systems for small interfering RNA (siRNA) was explored. In recent years, the potential of siRNA as {{a new class of}} therapeutics has attracted great attention. The ubiquitous nature of RNA interference (RNAi) implies that siRNA can be used to silence any disease-causing gene to treat any disease. The hurdle that needs to be overcome to turn siRNA therapy into clinical reality is its delivery into the cytosol, where gene silencing by siRNA occurs. Although numerous systems have been developed for the delivery of siRNA, safety and efficiency are major concerns associated with current formulations. Therefore this project aimed to prepare a stable peptide emulsion formulation and to conduct initial tests of its ability to deliver siRNA in vitro. The human tumour suppressor gene p 53 and the human breast cancer MCF- 7 cell line were used as the model gene and model cell line, respectively. The commercially available <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection</b> <b>reagent</b> Lipofectamine™ 2000 was used as the benchmark control. Sonication and membrane extrusion were used to formulate emulsions with droplet size (d= 120 nm) suitable for intravenous applications using peptide surfactant in the presence of Zn(II). Although these peptide emulsions are stable by themselves and in bovine serum, emulsion stability was found to be strongly affected by the presence of salt, EDTA, and proteins. The instability of AM 1 emulsion in cell culture media has been a concern when it was subjected to in vitro cell culture tests. AM 1 -stabilised emulsion droplets were shown to be taken up by MCF- 7 cells. However, siRNA when coupled with AM 1 emulsion was not delivered into cells. Cytotoxicity studies showed that peptide surfactants did not exhibit high-level toxicity to CHO cells at the tested concentrations (0. 25 - 2 mg mL- 1). AM 1 peptide-stabilised emulsions were mildly toxic to CHO cells but no toxicity was observed with MCF- 7 cells. Future work could include evaluation of peptide emulsion-siRNA complex formation, and exploring the effects of different cell culture media compositions on emulsion stability and their relation to cytotoxicity...|$|E
40|$|Nucleic acids {{could be}} used as {{therapeutic}} agents for the treatment of many different diseases, but poor delivery limits their clinical application. A series of pH-responsive amphipathic peptides containing histidine or 2, 3 -diaminopropionic acid (Dap) derivatives, LAH and LADap peptides, were investigated in this study as nucleic acid carriers for the treatment of respiratory infectious disease. LAH and LADap peptides are cationic, amphipathic pH-responsive peptides. The major attractive property of these peptides is their ability to promote endosomal escape, hence enhance transfection efficiency. Both LAH and LADap peptides were able to form complexes with DNA and small interfering RNA (siRNA) through electrostatic interaction and facilitated cellular uptake via endocytosis. In acidic environments (e. g. in endosomes and lysosomes), the peptides were released from the complexes and changed their conformational structures to display membrane-destabilizing activity. Subsequently, nucleic acids were released from the endosomal/lysosomal compartments into the cytoplasm with improved transfection efficiency. These peptides were effective in transferring DNA and siRNA in various cell lines including human lung epithelial cells. In addition, they were less toxic than the commercially available <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection</b> <b>reagent</b> LipofectamineTM 2000. LAH 4 -L 1 and LADap(Me) 6 -L 1 were the two most efficient peptides of the LAH and LADap peptide series respectively, and were selected for further formulation development for pulmonary delivery. To determine the optimal carrier for delivering nucleic acids to the lungs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was used as a model of airway surface liquid in the in vitro transfection experiments. High transfection efficiency was maintained with LADap(Me) 6 -L 1 peptide, making it a promising vector for pulmonary nucleic acid delivery. Two drying methods, spray drying and spray freeze drying, were investigated to prepare dry powder formulation containing pH-responsive peptides and nucleic acids for inhalation. Both methods could produce powders with desirable aerodynamic properties for inhalation. The physical integrity and biological activity of the nucleic acids were also successfully retained. Overall, SD powders performed better than SFD powders, suggesting that spray drying was a more suitable method to produce inhalable nucleic acid formulation. The clinical potential of the spray-dried powder formulation the peptide-based nucleic acid delivery system was further investigated for the treatment of lung diseases. siRNA has considerable therapeutic potential for treating respiratory infectious diseases including influenza. By introducing siRNA targeting the conserved region of viral genes encoding nucleocapsid protein (NP), viral replication can be inhibited in mammalian cells. Powder formulations containing antiviral siRNA against H 1 N 1 influenza virus and pH-responsive peptides were produced by spray drying. The SD powders were characterized and found to be suitable for inhalation with good stability. The formulations mediated highly effective in vitro delivery of antiviral siRNA into mammalian lung epithelial cells, leading to significant inhibition of viral replication when the transfected cells were subsequently challenged with H 1 N 1 influenza virus. SD siRNA powders containing pH-responsive peptides are promising inhalable formulations to deliver antiviral siRNA against influenza and are readily adapted for the treatment of other respiratory diseases. published_or_final_versionPharmacology and PharmacyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

This study outlines {{the effect of}} cryo-manipulation of a cationic lipid-based formulation, Lipofectamine 2000, which, after being frozen and thawed, showed orders of magnitude higher plasmid delivery efficiency throughout eight different cell lines, without compromising cell viability. Increased transfection efficiency with the freeze-thawed reagent was also seen with 2 '-O-methyl phosphorothioate oligonucleotide delivery and in a splice-correction assay. Most importantly, a log-scale improvement in gene delivery using the freeze-thawed reagent was seen in vivo. Using three different methods, we detected considerable differences in the polydispersity of the different nucleic acid complexes as well as observed a clear difference in their surface spreading and sedimentation, with the freeze-thawed ones displaying substantially higher rate of dispersion and deposition on the glass surface. This hitherto overlooked elevated potency of the freeze-thawed reagent facilitates the targeting of hard-to-transfect cells, accomplishes higher transfection rates, and decreases the overall amount of reagent needed for delivery. Additionally, as we also saw {{a slight increase in}} plasmid delivery using other freeze-thawed <b>transfection</b> <b>reagents,</b> we postulate that freeze-thawing might prove to be useful for an even wider variety of <b>transfection</b> <b>reagents...</b>|$|R
40|$|Nucleic acid therapies {{may have}} {{significant}} potential for effectively treating genetic, hyper-proliferative or malignant skin conditions caused by aberrant gene expression. To be effective, the restorative pDNA or inhibitive siRNA must access the viable skin layers and cells {{in a stable}} and functional form, preferably without painful administration. Microneedles are able to penetrate the stratum corneum skin barrier in a minimally invasive manner to allow targeted delivery of therapeutic macromocules. To date, there are limited studies reporting the delivery of nucleic acids, particularly siRNA, to the skin using microneedle devices. A range of in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo skin models was developed to characterise nucleic acid delivery and functional response. In vitro studies conducted in both continuous and primary keratinocyte cultures provided proof-of-concept of efficient and non-toxic cell uptake and gene silencing with siRNA and moderately efficient gene expression with pDNA. In initial studies, pDNA and siRNA was pre-complexed with <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection</b> <b>reagents,</b> however, {{in the case of}} siRNA, coating of the lipoplexes onto microneedles resulted in a reduction in functionality. Hence, modified self-delivery (sd) siRNA formulations were used in subsequent microneedle delivery experiments. Stainless steel microneedles coated with reporter pDNA or sd-siRNA were successful in penetrating the stratum corneum barrier of ex vivo viable human breast skin. It was difficult to demonstrate equivocally both plasmid gene expression and functional gene silencing in the skin explants, which only remain viable for short periods. Delivery of pDNA and sd-siRNA to in vivo mouse skin however, resulted in demonstrable gene expression and gene silencing, particularly evident at the protein level, in an established transgenic reporter mouse skin model. Overall, these investigations generally support the use of the coated steel microneedles for the simple and potentially self-administrable delivery of nucleic acids to the skin...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2014. Major: Chemistry. Advisor: Theresa Reineke. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xix, 208 pages. Cationic polymers {{have been widely}} explored as non-viral nucleic acid delivery vectors for gene therapy, as {{they are able to}} complex with nucleic acids, protect genetic materials from degradation, and facilitate the internalization of transgene expression process. To understand how various structural elements impact the nucleic acid delivery, several classes of polycations were synthesized and examined for their in vitro transfection performance. Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization was employed for the synthesis of several series of diblock glycopolycations with different carbohydrate containing blocks, including poly(2 -deoxy- 2 -methacrylamido glucopyranose) (PMAG) and poly(methacrylamidotrehalose) (PMAT). Amine containing monomers were subsequently polymerized through chain extension to yield cationic blocks for nucleic acid binding, including N-[3 -(N, N-dimethylamino) propyl] methacrylamide (DMAPMA), N-(2 -aminoethyl) methacrylamide (AEMA), aminoethylmethacrylate (AEMT), N-methyl aminoethylmethacrylate (MAEMT), N,N-dimethyl aminoethylmethacrylate (DMAEMT), and N,N,N-trimethylammoniumethylmethacrylate (TMAEMT). Initially, it was demonstrated that these polymers were all able to complex plasmid DNA into polyplex structures and prevent colloidal aggregation of polyplexes in physiological salt conditions. More importantly, glycopolymers with PMAT block can prevent polyplexes from aggregation, and exhibit the ability to protect polyplexes through the cycle of lyophilization and reconstitution. The role of charge type, block length, and cell type on transfection efficiency and toxicity were studied for the in vitro transfection in both HeLa (human cervix adenocarcinoma) and HepG 2 (human liver hepatocellular carcinoma) cells by comparing the polyplexes formulation created with PMAG-b-PAEMA and PMAG-b-PDMAPMA. The glycopolycation vehicles with primary amine blocks and PAEMA homopolymers revealed much higher transfection efficiency and lower toxicity when compared to analogs created with DMAPMA. Block length was also shown to influence cellular delivery and toxicity; as the block length of DMAPMA increased, polyplex toxicity increased while transfection decreased. While the charge block {{played a major role in}} delivery, the MAG block length did not affect these cellular parameters. Cell type played a major role in efficiency, these glycopolymers revealed higher cellular uptake and transfection efficiency in HepG 2 cells than in HeLa cells, while homopolycations (PAEMA and PDMAPMA) lacking the MAG blocks exhibited the opposite trend signifying that the MAG block could aid in hepatocyte transfection. Lastly, a new class of lipophilic polycations were designed, poly(alkylamidoamine) (PAAA) was synthesized to understand the role of lyophilicity in pDNA transfection. PAAAs with various length of lipophilic linker (C 3 to C 6) were synthesized via step-growth polymerization, and examined for their in-vitro transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity in multiple cell types, including HDFa (human dermal fibroblasts, adult) cells, HeLa (human cervix adenocarcinoma) cells, HMEC (human mammary epithelial cells), and HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial cells). The PAAA vehicles exhibited comparable or even superior transfection efficiency to Lipofectamine 2000, a leading <b>lipid-based</b> <b>transfection</b> <b>reagent.</b> It was revealed that, for the PAAA polymers examined in this study, an increase in lipophilicity leads to higher cytotoxicity, but also raised the transfection efficiency in HeLa cells. Overall, we demonstrated the great potential of carbohydrate containing polymer block, which has potential to serve as a targeting moiety, stealthy coating, and even lyo-protectant for polyplex formulations. Different amine types were examined for their nucleic acid delivery ability, and we conclude that tertiary amine containing monomer, DMAPMA, exhibits high toxicity along with low transfection efficiency while primary amine block shows relatively lower toxicity and higher transfection efficiency. Finally, the lipophilic polycations, PAAAs, were shown to be important for improving transfection efficiency in multiple cell types...|$|E

The expression of caspase- 3 at mRNA and protein level was assessed at different times posttransfection and its downstream biological events were also monitored.

The properties and efficiencies of PEI-functionalized SWNTs and MWNTs as nonviral <b>transfection</b> <b>reagents</b> were compared, and whether the functionalization procedure reduces the cytotoxicity of PEI was discussed.|$|R
40|$|Several protein <b>transfection</b> <b>reagents</b> are commercially {{available}} and are powerful tools for elucidating {{function of a}} protein in a cell. Here we described protein transfection studies of the {{commercially available}} reagents, Pro- DeliverIN, Xfect, and TuboFect, using Huh- 7 multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS) as a three-dimensional in vitro tumor model. A cellular uptake study using specific endocytosis inhibitors revealed that each reagent was internalized into Huh- 7 MCTS by different mechanisms, which {{were the same as}} monolayer cultured Huh- 7 cells. A certain amount of Pro-DeliverIN and Xfect was uptaken by Huh- 7 cells through caveolae-mediated endocytosis, which may lead to transcytosis through the surface-first layered cells of MCTS. The results presented here will help in the choice and use of protein <b>transfection</b> <b>reagents</b> for evaluating anti-tumor therapeutic proteins against MCTS models...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{family of}} {{cationic}} lipid <b>transfection</b> <b>reagents</b> described here demonstrates a modular design that offers {{potential for the}} ready synthesis {{of a wide variety}} of molecular variants. The key feature of these new molecules is the use of Tris as a linker for joining the hydrophobic domain to a cationic head group. The molecular design offers the opportunity to conveniently synthesise compounds differing in charge, the number and nature of hydrophobic groups in the hydrophobic domain and the characteristics of the spacer between the cationic and hydrophobic moieties. We show that prototype reagents of this design can deliver reporter genes into cultured cells with efficiencies rivalling those of established cationic lipid <b>transfection</b> <b>reagents.</b> A feature of these reagents is that they are not dependent on formulation with a neutral lipid for activity...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{optimize}} a nonviral gene transfection system {{targeting the}} corneal limbal stem/progenitor cells. METHODS. A plasmid containing LacZ gene coding for beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) was transfected into human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) and multilineage progenitor cells (MLPCs) with different <b>transfection</b> <b>reagents,</b> {{to determine the}} optimal <b>transfection</b> <b>reagent.</b> In an ex vivo study, the bovine corneal epithelium and limbal stem/progenitor cells were transfected with a microinjection system with a 36 -gauge needle that delivered plasmid/transfection reagent (Lipofectamine 2000; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) complexes. The transfected corneoscleral discs were cultured in an air-interface culture system. The expression of (beta-gal) was determined with an X-gal staining assay, and images were acquired with light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The expression of cytokeratin K 5 / 14 and K 3 /K 12 in corneal and limbal epithelium was determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS. The highest percentages of beta-gal expression in HCECs and MLPCs were achieved when the <b>transfection</b> <b>reagent</b> Lipofectamine 2000 was used. Corneal epithelial and limbal basal cells were successfully transfected with the reporter gene by targeted microinjection of plasmid/liposomal complexes. The location of the bovine limbal stem/progenitor cells was confirmed by positive K 5 /K 14 labeling and negative K 3 / 12 labeling. CONCLUSIONS. Targeted microinjection of plasmid/liposomal complexes resulted in limbal stem/progenitor cell transfection. This technique has potential for the short-term treatment of corneal diseases...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{represents}} a promising therapeutic and prophylactic macromolecule in treating genetic diseases, infectious diseases and cancers. The therapeutic potential of DNA {{is directly related}} to how DNA transports within the targeted tissue. In this study, fluorescence photobleaching recovery was used to examine the diffusion of plasmid DNAs with various size (2. 7 ∼ 8. 3 kb), topology, and in the presence of <b>transfection</b> <b>reagents</b> in mucus. We observed that DNAs diffused slower when size of DNAs increased; supercoiled DNAs diffused faster than linear ones; mucus did not reduce the diffusion of linear DNAs but retarded the diffusion of supercoiled DNAs. Diffusion data were fitted to models of a polymer chain diffusing in gel systems. Diffusion of linear DNAs in mucus were better described by the Zimm model with a scaling factor of − 0. 8, and supercoiled DNAs showed a reptational behavior with a scaling factor of − 1. 3. Based on the Zimm model, the pore size of bovine mucus was estimated and agreed well with previous experimental data. In the presence of <b>transfection</b> <b>reagents,</b> e. g., liposomes, the diffusion of DNAs increased by a factor of 2 in mucus. By using bovine mucus as a model system, this work suggests that DNA size, topology, and the presence of <b>transfection</b> <b>reagents</b> may affect the diffusion of DNA in tissues, and thus the therapeutic effects of DNA...|$|R
30|$|For i.p. injection, the in vivo-jet PEITM <b>transfection</b> <b>reagent</b> (optimized {{cationic}} linear PEI-based <b>transfection</b> <b>reagent</b> for in vivo experiments), {{also from}} Polyplus-transfection (Illkirch, France), was used, which provided as a ready-to-use solution at 150 mM nitrogen concentration {{and less than}} 0.1 EU/mL endotoxin. SiRNA-EGFR (3 μl, 200 μmol/L) and LPEI (0.75 μl) were dissolved in 250 μl of 5 % glucose solution (GS), respectively. The latter was pipetted into the siRNA solution 10 minutes later. After vortexing and incubating {{at room temperature for}} 20 minutes, stable LPEI/siRNA-EGFR complexes under N/P ratio of 5 were formed in 5 % GS at a final volume of 500 μl. Afterwards, they were intraperitoneally administrated to each mouse in 1 h. At the same time, a corresponding dose of LPEI complexed non-specific siRNA-NEG or 5 % GS were given to the other two groups as controls.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that overexpression of the transcription factor E 2 F 2 promotes cell cycle progression in nonproliferating corneal endothelial cells. METHODS. Ex vivo rabbit corneas were transfected with a lipid <b>transfection</b> <b>reagent</b> and either a control plasmid containing full-length cDNA for enhanced green fluorescent protein (pIRES 2 -EGFP) or a plasmid containing full-length cDNA for both E 2 F 2 and EGFP (pIRES 2 -E 2 F 2 /EGFP).

30|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{are considered}} an efficient carrier for nonviral gene delivery. Compared to viral vectors, nonviral <b>transfection</b> <b>reagents</b> eliminate {{the possibility of}} carcinogenesis and severe immune response caused by viral vectors and provide a safer alternative for the clinical application of gene therapy [47]. However, the efficiency of nonviral transfection is relatively low compared to viral transfection. We showed that the siRNA transfection efficiency of both PEI-NH-SWNTs and PEI-NH-MWNTs was comparable to the commercially available DharmaFECT reagent (Figure  10). A similar comparison of transfection efficiency with another common <b>transfection</b> <b>reagent</b> was reported on MWNTs functionalized with 600 -Da PEI [21]. Nevertheless, Varkouhi et al. compared the transfection efficiency of PEI-functionalized MWNTs with Lipofectamine but found that PEI-functionalized MWNTs were less effective in siRNA delivery [28]. Further studies on in vivo siRNA transfection by PEI-functionalized carbon nanotubes {{may be necessary to}} elucidate their effectiveness in gene delivery.|$|R
30|$|We were {{interested}} in assessing the potential role of the ZEB 1 protein in mediating the regulation of FXYD 3 expression by estrogen and tamoxifen. Towards that goal, we transfected cells with siRNA directed against human ZEB 1 in order to decrease ZEB 1 expression. MCF- 7 cells were grown in 6 -well plates until 50 % confluency. Maintenance media was replaced with antibiotic free Opti-MEM for 24  h prior to transfection. Transfection of the cells was carried out using Santa Cruz <b>Transfection</b> <b>Reagents.</b> Working under a sterile tissue culture hood, Opti-MEM was exchanged for 1  ml of serum-free, antibiotic free Opti-MEM for each well and plates {{were placed in the}} incubator while siRNA-lipid complexes were prepared. For each well to be transfected, two microcentrifuge tubes, one for diluting the siRNA (Solution A) and one for diluting the lipid <b>transfection</b> <b>reagent</b> (Solution B) were prepared. Solution A tubes contained 100  μl of Opti-MEM and 6  μl of the ZEB 1 siRNA. Solution B tubes contained 100  μl of Opti-MEM and 6  μl of <b>transfection</b> <b>reagent.</b> For each pair of tubes, the A and B tubes were combined by transferring Solution A slowly drop-wise into Solution B. The combined contents now in tube B were gently mixed up and down with a micropipette to insure a uniform reaction of the reagents.
