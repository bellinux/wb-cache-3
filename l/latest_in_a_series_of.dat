Hiroshi Yamauchi, Nintendo's {{president}} at the time, assigned the project to a first-time video game designer named Shigeru Miyamoto. Drawing {{from a wide range of}} inspirations, including Popeye, Beauty and the Beast, and King Kong, Miyamoto developed the scenario and designed the game alongside Nintendo's chief engineer, Gunpei Yokoi. The two men broke new ground by using graphics as a means of characterization, including cutscenes to advance the game's plot, and integrating multiple stages into the gameplay.|$|E

25|$|Although {{antagonism}} {{about the}} expense of Byzantine domination had long persisted within Italy, the political rupture was set in motion in earnest in 726 by the iconoclasm of Emperor Leo III the Isaurian.

In 731, his successor, Pope Gregory III organized a synod in Rome (attended by the Archbishop of Ravenna), which declared iconoclasm punishable by excommunication.

[...] On consulting a numerologist, who happens to have an office in the same building as the killer's apartment, Reyes ties the murders together.
