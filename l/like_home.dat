25|$|Henzell also shot some footage {{for what}} was planned as his next film, No Place <b>Like</b> <b>Home,</b> in Harder's aftermath, but he went broke before he could finish the film. Fed up by this, {{and the lack of}} finance for further production, he {{went on to become a}} writer, {{publishing}} his first novel, Power Game, in 1982. Both were meant to complete a planned trilogy of films centring on Ivanhoe Martin. The footage for No Place <b>Like</b> <b>Home</b> was lost. Years later, he came across editing tapes in a lab in New York. Just to have a sense of completion, he worked on the project. When he showed it to a few friends, their response was enthusiastic. He eventually was able to retrieve the original footage. No Place <b>Like</b> <b>Home</b> was screened for the public at the 31st annual Toronto International Film Festival in September 2006 at the Cumberland Theatre; it was sold out.

25|$|Claude McKay was a {{poet who}} flourished during the Harlem Renaissance, a major {{literary}} {{movement in the}} 1920s. During this time, McKay’s poems challenged white authority while celebrating Jamaican culture. He also wrote tales about the trials and tribulations {{of life as a}} black man in both Jamaica and America. McKay was not secretive about his hatred for racism and felt that racist people were stupid and could not look past their shortsightedness and hatred. In tales <b>like</b> <b>Home</b> to Harlem', McKay depicts a culture in Harlem that is full of drug use, prostitution, and a variety of sexual encounters. His depiction was criticized as a negative portrayal of Harlem and its lower-class citizens by prominent figures such as W.E.B. DuBois, but was later applauded as a literary force in the Harlem Renaissance. McKay’s poetry brought awareness to the racist treatment that many black individuals faced.|$|E
