40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} <b>insertion</b> <b>forces</b> utilized during simulated placement of a urethral catheter by healthcare individuals {{with a variety of}} catheter experience. Materials and Methods: A 21 F urethral catheter was mounted to a metal spring. Participants were asked to press the tubing spring against a force gauge and stop when they met a level of resistance that would typically make them terminate a catheter placement. Simulated catheter insertion was repeated fives times, and peak compression forces were recorded. Healthcare professionals were divided into six groups according to their title: urology staff, non-urology staff, urology resident/ fellow, non-urology resident/ fellow, medical student, and registered nurse. Results: A total of fifty-seven healthcare professionals participated in the study. Urology staff (n = 6) had the <b>lowest</b> average <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> for any group at 6. 8 ± 2. 0 Newtons (N). Medical students (n = 10) had the least amount of experience (1 ± 0 years) and the highest average <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> range of 10. 1 ± 3. 7 N. Health care workers with greater than 25 years experience used significantly less <b>force</b> during catheter <b>insertions</b> (4. 9 ± 1. 8 N) compared to all groups (p < 0. 01). Conclusions: We propose the maximum force that should be utilized during urethral catheter insertion is 5 Newtons. This force deserves validation in a larger population and should be considered when designing urethral catheters or creating catheter simulators. Understanding urethral catheter <b>insertion</b> <b>forces</b> may also aid in establishing competency parameters for health care professionals in training...|$|R

50|$|A normal {{integrated}} circuit (IC) socket requires the IC {{to be pushed}} into sprung contacts which then grip by friction. For an IC with hundreds of pins, the total insertion force can be very large (hundreds of newtons), leading to a danger of damage to the device or the circuit board. Also, even with relatively small pin counts, each pin extraction is fairly awkward and carries a significant risk of bending pins, particularly if the person performing the extraction hasn't had much practice or if the board is crowded. <b>Low</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> (<b>LIF)</b> sockets reduce the issues of insertion and extraction, but because of its lower insertion force than a conventional socket, are likely to produce less reliable connections.|$|E

30|$|In phase II, {{the total}} <b>insertion</b> <b>force,</b> the {{friction}} force, and the needle tip force repeatedly increased and decreased. This {{can be explained}} by the fact that muscle tissue consists of fibers and bundles [13].

The needle tip force was a constant 0.5  N while the total <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> increased.|$|R

40|$|Needle {{insertion}} into {{soft tissue}} {{is one of}} the most common medical interventions. This study provides macroscopic and microscopic observations of needle–gel interactions. A gelatin mixture is used as a soft-tissue simulant. For the macroscopic studies, system parameters, such as insertion velocity, needle diameter, gel elasticity, needle tip shape (including bevel angle) and insertion motion profile, are varied, while the maximum <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> and maximum needle deflection are recorded. The needle tip and gel interactions are observed using confocal microscopic images. Observations indicate that increasing the insertion velocity and needle diameter results in larger <b>insertion</b> <b>forces</b> and smaller needle deflections. Varying the needle bevel angle from 8 ° to 82 ° results in the <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> increasing mono- tonically, while the needle deflection does not. These variations are due to the coupling between gel rupture and tip compression interactions, which are observed during microscopic studies. Increasing the gel elasticity results in larger <b>insertion</b> <b>forces</b> and needle deflections. Varying the tip shapes demonstrates that bevel-tipped needles produce the larg- est deflection, but <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> does not vary among the tested tip shapes. Insertion with different motion profiles are performed. Results show that adding 1 Hz rotational motion during linear insertion decreases the needle deflection. Increasing the rotational motion from 1 Hz to 5 Hz decreases the <b>insertion</b> <b>force,</b> while the needle deflection remains the same. A high-velocity (250 mm/s and 300 mm/s) tapping during insertion yields no significant decrease in needle deflection and a slight increase in <b>insertion</b> <b>force...</b>|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare standard trocar entry with our reduced-force closed trocar entry technique by measuring trocar <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> using a mechanical force gauge. Methods: In the operating room, the force gauge was inserted into a sterile glove and connected to the proximal portion of the trocar to measure <b>insertion</b> <b>force.</b> Through one incision, we used a standard closed trocar entry, while through the other incision, we used our reducedforce closed trocar entry technique. After making the skin incision and before trocar entry, we spread and dilated the skin, subcutaneous tissue, fascia, and muscle with a hemostat. Results: Twenty-five patients entered the trial and none were excluded. Median trocar <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> was 3. 3 lb (range, 1. 6 to 5. 4) with our reduced-force trocar entry technique versus 6. 5 lb (range, 2. 0 to 14. 0) with the standard trocar entry (P�. 001). No complications occurred with the reduced-force trocar entry technique. Conclusion: Our reduced-force trocar entry technique decreases trocar <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> by 50 %, requires no additional instruments or cost and is fast and safe.

40|$|AbstractInsertion of {{needle into}} tissue is {{influenced}} by the cutting edges and the needle tip geometry. In this paper, we aimed at investigating the relationship between the <b>insertion</b> <b>forces</b> and cutting edge geometry and general mathematical models of included and inclination angles for two different needle configurations. Two new geometries, one with parabolic cut and other with parabolic surface, cut with two bevel planes have been proposed along with the corresponding mathematical models to improve the cutting edge properties. Results show that parabolic needles after cutting with bevel planes have significantly improved cutting edge properties and are better than the other common needle configurations such as bevel cut. Simulation studies predicted that the deformation and stresses are slightly higher for proposed needle tip geometries than currently available topologies.

The current surgical setup of cochlear implant surgery is briefly re-viewed and its limitations are highlighted. In {{an effort to reduce}} trauma to the structure of the cochlea, the kinematics and path planning for novel cochlear steerable electrodes are developed to minimize the interaction forces between the electrode and the cochlea. An experimental robotic system is used to com-pare the electrode <b>insertion</b> <b>forces</b> of steerable implants with those of non-steerable electrodes.
