Since Domalpalli's experience was limited to short video films with a different aspect ratio, he was shocked to <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Super 16mm lens the day they commenced the shoot. However, Kam helped him to stay composed during the production.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> history of biology from the ancient Greeks onwards and discover anticipations of almost all of Charles Darwin's key ideas. For example, Loren Eiseley has found isolated passages written by Buffon suggesting he was almost ready to piece together a theory of natural selection, but states that such anticipations {{should not be taken}} out of the full context of the writings or of cultural values of the time which made Darwinian ideas of evolution unthinkable.|$|E
5|$|On 20 August 1839 Meyerbeer, whilst {{relaxing}} at Boulogne in {{the company}} of Moscheles, {{met for the first time}} with Richard Wagner, who was en route to Paris. Their ensuing relationship (see below) was to have major repercussions for the careers and reputations of both. At this meeting Wagner read to Meyerbeer from the libretto of Rienzi, and Meyerbeer agreed to <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> score, which indeed he subsequently recommended for performance at Dresden.|$|E

25|$|In {{his last}} film, The Sacrifice, Tarkovsky worked with cinematographer Sven Nykvist, {{who had worked}} closely with {{director}} Ingmar Bergman on many of Ingmar Bergman's films – multiple people who worked with Bergman worked on the production, notably lead actor Erland Josephson, who had acted for Tarkovsky in Nostalghia. Nykvist complained that Tarkovsky would frequently <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> camera and even direct actors through it.|$|E

25|$|Once in orbit, the {{spacecraft}} could be rotated in three directions: along its longitudinal axis (roll), {{left to right}} from the astronaut's point of view (yaw), and up or down (pitch). Movement was created by rocket-propelled thrusters which used hydrogen peroxide as a fuel. For orientation, the pilot could <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> window {{in front of him}} or from a screen connected to a periscope which could be turned 360°.|$|E
25|$|Stock Rotation is the {{practice}} of changing the way inventory is displayed on a regular basis. This is most commonly used in hospitality and retail - particularity where food products are sold. For example, {{in the case of}} supermarkets that a customer frequents on a regular basis, the customer may know exactly what they want and where it is. This results in many customers going straight to the product they seek and do not look at other items on sale. To discourage this practice, stores will rotate the location of stock to encourage customers to <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> entire store. This is in hopes the customer will pick up items they would not normally see.|$|E
25|$|The nose-gear light {{indicators}} {{were designed}} to be fail safe by having two separate light bulbs. This proved to be inadequate, as {{it was impossible to}} <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> cover to check whether one of the bulbs had been compromised, meaning that a failure of one bulb would not be detected until both bulbs malfunctioned. The first bulb was thus presumed to have gone inoperative some time before the day of the flight, while the second bulb broke during Flight 933. The NTSB therefore advised the Federal Aviation Administration to articulate means to avoid similar compromised fail-safe designs in the future. Both pilots had minimum-descent altitude light warnings, which were presumed to have given a visual warning, but because of the work overload, neither pilot directed his attention to these alerts.|$|E

25|$|This stage {{takes place}} after the auditions have been completed, and is also {{referred}} to as Deliberation Day, in which the judges <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> acts that have successfully made it to this stage, and begin whittling them down to those who would stand a fair chance in the live semi-finals. The amount that goes through has varied over the show's history, though usually consists of a number that can be divided equally over the semi-finals being held in a series. Once the judges have decided on who will go through, all contestants that have reached this stage are called back to discover if they had progress into the live semi-finals or not. After this has been done, the acts are divided up between the semi-finals that the series will have; usually eight in each series, except for the sixth to tenth series which had nine acts per semi-final.|$|E
500|$|Revenge of the Sith {{eventually}} {{became the first}} Star Wars film in which Anakin Skywalker and the suited Darth Vader were played by the same actor in the same film. As Christensen recounted, it was originally intended to simply have a [...] "tall guy" [...] in the Darth Vader costume, but after [...] "begging and pleading" [...] Christensen persuaded Lucas to have the Vader costume used in the film created specifically to fit him. The new costume featured shoe lifts and a muscle suit. It also required Christensen (who is [...] tall) to <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> helmet's mouthpiece.|$|E
500|$|Barry planned an enfilade, or what Christopher Jones, {{the former}} BBC {{political}} editor, has called [...] "one long spine of Lords' and Commons' Chambers" [...] which enabled the Speaker of the House of Commons to <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{line of the}} building to see the Queen's throne in the House of Lords. Laid out around 11courtyards, the building included several residences with accommodation for about 200people, and comprised a total of 1,180rooms, 126staircases and [...] of corridors. Between 1836 and 1837 Pugin made more detailed drawings on which estimates were made for the palace's completion; reports of the cost estimates vary from £707,000 to £725,000, with six years until completion of the project.|$|E

500|$|... "Elegy" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban and {{directed}} by James Charleston. The episode was inspired by an event that happened when Shiban and his future wife were visiting her father in the hospital. According to Shiban, he was very near death and kept looking around the room, {{even though there were}} only two visitors with him. Eventually, he asked his daughter how many people were in the room. When his daughter revealed that there were only two people with him, he kept looking around the room. Shiban was inspired by the idea that [...] "a dying person might be able to <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> cracks [...] into the next world". He developed a premise revolving around a [...] "haunted bowling alley" [...] because [...] "it just seemed right".|$|E
500|$|MacLachlan did {{not like}} the bomber training. In a letter to his mother he {{described}} his grievances, [...] "We have started bombing today. It's awful! You have to lie on your belly and <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> trapdoor {{in the bottom of the}} plane [...] All the hot oily air from the radiator blows straight into your face. It makes me feel quite sick!". He was enthusiastic about describing the mathematical problems associated with aerial bombing and the use of cameras to judge accuracy rather than using live-munitions, but MacLachlan was more enamoured with air-to-air gunnery. He wrote of his training, [...] "I have been doing air-to-air gunnery with the front guns today. It is super!" [...] Live ammunition was used at the end of the training. MacLachlan was permitted to train using 16 bombs, which cost £1 1s each.|$|E
500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{was asked}} for advice and {{guidance}} {{not just on}} the Russian Symphony Concerts, but on other projects through which Belyayev aided Russian composers. [...] "By force of matters purely musical I {{turned out to be the}} head of the Belyayev circle", he wrote. [...] "As the head Belyayev, too, considered me, consulting me about everything and referring everyone to me as chief". In 1884 Belyayev set up an annual Glinka prize, and in 1885 he founded his own music publishing firm, through which he published works by Borodin, Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov at his own expense. To select which composers to assist with money, publication or performances from the many who now appealed for help, Belyayev set up an advisory council made up of Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov. They would <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> compositions and appeals submitted and suggest which composers were deserving of patronage and public attention.|$|E

500|$|Man Ray photographed {{some of the}} {{mathematical}} models in the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris, including Objet mathematique (Mathematical object). He noted that this represented Enneper surfaces with constant negative curvature, derived from the pseudo-sphere. This mathematical foundation was important to him, as it allowed him to deny that the object was [...] "abstract", instead claiming that it was as real as the urinal that Duchamp made into a work of art. Man Ray admitted that the object's [...] formula [...] "meant nothing to me, but the forms themselves were as varied and authentic as any in nature." [...] He used his photographs of {{the mathematical}} models as figures in his series he did on Shakespeare's plays, such as his 1934 painting Antony and Cleopatra. The art reporter Jonathan Keats, writing in ForbesLife, argues that Man Ray photographed [...] "the elliptic paraboloids and conic points in the same sensual light as his pictures of Kiki de Montparnasse", and [...] "ingeniously repurposes the cool calculations of mathematics to reveal the topology of desire". Twentieth century sculptors such as Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth and Naum Gabo took inspiration from mathematical models. Moore wrote of his 1938 Stringed Mother and Child: [...] "Undoubtedly the source of my stringed figures was the Science Museum... I {{was fascinated by the}} mathematical models I saw there... It wasn't the scientific study of these models but the ability to <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> strings as with a bird cage and to see one form within another which excited me." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon Belyayev became {{interested}} in other Russian composers. In 1884 he set up an annual Glinka Prize, named after pioneer Russian composer Mikhail Glinka (1804–1857). In 1885, disgusted {{with the quality of}} music publishing in Russia and the lack of foreign copyright for works printed there, he founded his own publishing firm in Leipzig, Germany. This firm initially issued works by Glazunov, Rimsky-Korsakov, Lyadov and Borodin at its own expense, and would boast a catalog of over 2000 works, all written by Russian composers, {{by the time of the}} October Revolution in 1917. At Rimsky-Korsakov's suggestion, Belyayev also founded his own concert series, the Russian Symphony Concerts, open exclusively to Russian composers. Among the works written especially for this series were the three by Rimsky-Korsakov for which he is currently best known in the West—Scheherazade, the Russian Easter Festival Overture and Capriccio Espagnol. These concerts would last until the October Revolution, and by 1910 would host premieres of 165 works. Belyayev set up an advisory council, made up of Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov, to select which among the many composers appealing for help should be assisted, either through money, publication or performances. This council would <b>look</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> compositions and appeals submitted and suggest which were deserving of patronage and public attention. Though the three worked together, Rimsky-Korsakov became the de facto leader of the group. [...] "By force of matters purely musical I turned out to be the head of the Belyayev circle", he wrote. [...] "As the head Belyayev, too, considered me, consulting me about everything and referring everyone to me as chief." ...|$|E
