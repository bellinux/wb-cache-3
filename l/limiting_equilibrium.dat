40|$|There {{are many}} methods for the {{analysis}} and design of embedded cantilever retaining walls. They involve various different simplifications of the pressure distribution to allow calculation of the <b>limiting</b> <b>equilibrium</b> retained height and the bending moment when the retained height {{is less than the}} <b>limiting</b> <b>equilibrium</b> value, i. e. the serviceability case. Recently, a new method for determining the serviceability earth pressure and bending moment has been proposed. This method makes an assumption defining the point of zero net pressure. This assumption implies that the passive pressure is not fully mobilised immediately below the excavation level. The finite element analyses presented in this paper examine the net pressure distribution on walls in which the retained height is less, than the <b>limiting</b> <b>equilibrium</b> value. The study shows that for all practical walls, the earth pressure distributions on the front and back of the wall are at their limit values, Kp and K-a respectively, when the lumped factor of safety F-r is {{less than or equal to}} 2. 0. A rectilinear net pressure distribution is proposed that is intuitively logical. It produces good predictions of the complete bending moment diagram for walls in the service configuration and the proposed method gives results that have excellent agreement with centrifuge model tests. The study shows that the method for determining the serviceability bending moment suggested by Padfield and Mair(1) in the CIRIA Report 104 gives excellent predictions of the maximum bending moment in practical cantilever walls. It provides the missing data that have been needed to verify and justify the CIRIA 104 method...|$|E

A slide in an abandoned, unreclaimed strip mine northwest of Sheridan, Wyoming, has been analyzed as an example of a long-term slope failure in the region. This slide occurred in early 1975, some 20 years after cessation of mining. This investigation used Spencer's <b>limiting</b> <b>equilibrium</b> method and an elastic-plastic finite element method incorporating the Drucker-Prager yield criterion. This slide was found to fit the model for time-dependent failure proposed by Nelson and Thompson (1977) in which the time to failure is related to Skempton's residual factor. The Nelson-Thompson hypothesis is extended for use with the three-dimensional Drucker-Prager yield criterion. The residual factor (R) may be computed from the factors of safety with respect to peak (F(p)) and residual (Fᵣ) material properties, using either the Mohr-Coulomb or Drucker-Prager criterion, by the relationship R = [(F(p) - 1) /(F(p) -Fᵣ) ] At the present time, the Spencer <b>limiting</b> <b>equilibrium</b> analysis is a more usable tool for ordinary slope design than the elastic-plastic finite element analysis because of the speed, simplicity, and ease of including the effects of ground water in the Spencer analysis...|$|E

40|$|During {{the spring}} of 2003, the {{downstream}} slope of an embankment dam began to move during an extreme flooding event. The current study was implemented to evaluate the slope stability of the embankment and as a case-study to compare the <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium</b> and continuum modeling methods. Initially, stability analyses were performed using conservative shear strength of soils estimated from both boring log data and an infinite slope back analysis. The Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion was employed in the computer simulations. The computer program UTEXAS 4 and Spencer method of solution {{was used to evaluate}} the <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium</b> factors of safety and the critical failure surface. The computer program FLAC 4. 0 was used to evaluate the stress/strain behavior of the slope and determine factors of safety using the strength reduction method. Both these <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium</b> and continuum models yielded slip surfaces that were close in geometry and location to the actual slip surface observed in the field. The factor of safety for the pre-failure embankment geometry was lower utilizing the <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium</b> approach than that estimated by the continuum approach; however, the continuum approach appeared to yield more accurate results when using the best estimate of the shear strength. Back-analyses performed based on the observed failure surface in the field after flooding event provided estimates of shear strength of the embankment soil. The back calculated shear strength utilizing the continuum model fell within acceptable ranges as determined from the boring log data, with the continuum model yielding the more conservative (lower) back calculated shear strength.
