40|$|Summary. The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} physicochemical analysis of sorghum bicolor of Biomass 140 variety and <b>pig</b> <b>liquid</b> manure. Sorghum silage of different degree of chaff length {{was subjected to}} methane fermentation in two variants, taking the quality of <b>pig</b> <b>liquid</b> manure as a criterion. German standard DIN 38 414 -S 8 constituted a methodological basis. It was proved that both at better {{as well as at}} worse physicochemical parameters of <b>pig</b> <b>liquid</b> manure, sorghum bicolor silage of Biomass 140 variety may obtain high yield of methane in biogas. Research results prove that sorghum silage may be successfully used as a substrate for biogas plants. Sorghum because of its low water and soil requirements may constitute an al-ternative for maize on weaker stands. Sorghum ensilage method is the same as an ensilage technique of the most popular substrate for biogas plants, i. e. maize. During 26 -days methane fermentation the highest average biogas yield was reported in a sample with silage A in va-riant I (254 lN·kg·smo- 1) and in a sample with silage C in both variants, respectively 1931 N·kg·smo- 1 i 207 lN·kg·smo- 1.

40|$|<b>Liquid</b> fed growing-finishing <b>pigs</b> {{receive an}} amount of water in their ration {{that is more than}} their {{physiological}} requirement. For welfare reasons {{it can be argued that}} in addition to this diet, pigs may be motivated to obtain additional fresh water. The aim of the present experiment was to test the hypotheses that <b>liquid</b> fed <b>pigs</b> will work harder to obtain extra fresh water, compared to dry fed pigs which receive water in a conventional way. A consumer-demand technique was used, in which flow rate from an extra (test) drinker determined the ease with which pigs could obtain the water. The more persistent pigs were to obtain water from the test drinker (with declining flow rates), the harder they were assumed to work for it. Four treatments were divided over 48 pens of 12 finishing pigs in 2 batches (566 pigs). There was one Dry Feed treatment (D, with standard drinking nipple in a single space trough) and three liquid feeding systems: Long trough (LT); Sensor Feeding (S) and Variomix (V). Each pen had an additional drinker with a weekly randomly changing flow rate of 134, 356, 733 or 1041 ml/min. From the extra drinker pigs used on average 3. 39 a (D), 0. 76 b (LT), 0. 58 bc (S) and 0. 44 c (V) litre per day (different superscripts indicate differences P < 0. 05). The persistence to obtain water differed between the four treatments. This was indicated by the rate of decline (¿i) of the asymptotic curve depicting water disappearance at decreasing flow rates: ¿i = 0. 00378 a, 0. 00274 ab, 0. 00122 b and 0. 00275 ab for D, LT, S and V, respectively. This suggests that <b>liquid</b> fed <b>pigs</b> work equally hard (LT and V) or less hard (S) to obtain water from an extra drinking nipple, compared to dry fed pigs (D...|$|R
50|$|With the {{introduction}} of the blast furnace to Europe in the Middle Ages, pig iron was able to be produced in much higher volumes than wrought iron. Because pig iron could be melted, people began to develop processes of reducing the carbon in the <b>liquid</b> <b>pig</b> iron to create steel. Puddling was introduced during the 1700s, where molten pig iron was stirred while exposed to the air, to remove the carbon by oxidation. In 1858, Sir Henry Bessemer developed a process of steel-making by blowing hot air through <b>liquid</b> <b>pig</b> iron to reduce the carbon content. The Bessemer process was able to produce the first large scale manufacture of steel. Once the Bessemer process began to gain widespread use, other alloys of steel began to follow. Mangalloy, an alloy of steel and manganese exhibiting extreme hardness and toughness, {{was one of the first}} alloy steels, and was created by Robert Hadfield in 1882.|$|E

50|$|Woodchip piles at {{the edge}} of a field can inhibit nitrates from running off into water tiles. They are a simple measure for farmers to reduce nitrate {{pollution}} of the watershed without them having to change their land management practice. A 2011 study showed that most of the nitrate removal was due to heterotrophic denitrification. A 2013 experiment from Ireland showed that after 70 days of startup, a woodchip pile loaded with <b>liquid</b> <b>pig</b> manure at 5 L/m2/day removed an average of 90% of nitrate in the form of ammonium after one month. A January 2015 study from Ohio State University showed very low nitrogen gas, i.e. greenhouse gas emissions from nitrate transformation under the anaerobic conditions of the wood chip bioreactor. Scientists constructed a model for water flow and nitrate removal kinetics which can be used to design denitrification beds. It is unknown if other nutrients like phosphorus or pathogens are affected by the bioreactor as well.|$|E

Songwriting, however, remained {{an integral part of}} her life, and she kept connected musically by collaborating with other artists, such as Yann Tiersen, David Bowie, Neil Finn, and Joey Waronker, on various projects. She returned to her solo career in 2002 with a flurry of releases. Independently, she released two compilations of songs from her back catalog: Concentrated is a selection of [...] "greatest hits" [...] with a few oddities (such as the Underdog remix of [...] "Lovesick"); Rare, Unusual or Just Bad Songs, however, is composed entirely of rarities (like [...] "Breathe Acrost Texas", which was omitted from the reissue of Happiness) and tracks that had never been available before, and each copy came with an insert painted by Germano herself. Later that year, she began gathering songs she had been writing and recording (mostly by herself at home) over the previous two years, and sent CDs of these tracks to a few labels and various friends in the music industry; the first to respond was her longtime acquaintance, producer/label executive Tony Berg. After the relative success of the ARTISTdirect family of music-related websites, co-founder and then-CEO Marc Geiger decided to start an actual record label, leading {{to the creation of the}} Ineffable imprint with Berg in 2002, with Germano as the label's first signing. Her sixth album, Lullaby for <b>Liquid</b> <b>Pig,</b> released in April 2003, features performances by guitarist Johnny Marr (formerly of The Smiths, currently of Modest Mouse), Neil Finn, and Wendy Melvoin. As before, the album met with critical acclaim, but the label itself was not successful enough for its owners, who shut it down shortly thereafter.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to conduct a thorough accounting of energy used to transport <b>liquid</b> <b>pig</b> manure from farm storage to the field and to surface-apply the manure. Energy consumption was determined using both energy data from the literature plus data from field-scale research. Energy consumption was compared between two manure application systems (the drag hose and the slurry wagon systems) and two application timing treatments (single vs. twice-annual manure application). The single annual application of <b>liquid</b> <b>pig</b> manure applied at 81. 5 m 3  ha- 1 and transported 1. 8  km from storage to field consumed 2180 mJ ha- 1 with the drag hose system and 2185 mJ ha- 1 with the slurry wagon system. The twice-annual manure application regime used 2726 and 2209 mJ ha- 1 for the drag hose and slurry wagon systems, respectively. When energy use was calculated on the basis of MJ per kg of available N, <b>liquid</b> <b>pig</b> manure applied once annually with the slurry wagon system provided N at 17. 76 mJ kg- 1 of available N, which was 33 % of the energy cost of N from anhydrous ammonia and 23 % of the energy cost of N from urea. Manure transport distance could be increased to 8. 4  km before the energy cost per kg of available N from pig manure was equivalent to anhydrous ammonia, and up to 12. 3  km before the energy cost of manure N was equivalent to urea N. Despite the high energy cost to deliver <b>liquid</b> <b>pig</b> manure from storage to field, the much lower cost per kg of available N compared to inorganic fertilizer N highlights the opportunities that exist for improving the energy efficiency of industrial agriculture by replacing inorganic fertilizers with manure. ...|$|E

A field site was constructed, and the runoff characteristic in surface and groundwater by the applied artificial rainfall was examined. A lab scale column test and jar test were also performed to identify the capacity of phosphorus adsorption in the soil.|$|R
