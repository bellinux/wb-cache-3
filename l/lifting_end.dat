5000|$|The raising chains could {{themselves}} {{be attached to}} counterweights. In some cases, a portcullis provides the weight, as at Alnwick. By the 14th century a bascule arrangement was provided by lifting arms (called [...] "gaffs") above and parallel to the bridge deck whose ends were linked by chains to the <b>lifting</b> <b>end</b> of the bridge; in the raised position the gaffs would fit into slots in the gatehouse wall ("rainures") which can often still be seen, as at Herstmonceux Castle. Inside the castle the gaffs were extended to bear counterweights, or might form the side-timbers of a stout gate which would be against {{the roof of the}} gate-passage when the drawbridge was down, but would close against the gate-arch as the bridge was raised. In France, working drawbridges survive at a number of châteaux, including the Château du Plessis-Bourré. [...] In England, two working drawbridges remain in regular use at Helmingham Hall, which dates from the early sixteenth century.|$|E

5000|$|As volumes further declined, {{the last}} Percy Main staithes closed in 1971, {{leading to the}} closure of the NCB lines, {{although}} the BR lines persisted.

The two prototype Metrocars worked out of a two road maintenance shed constructed in Middle Engine Lane. Once the Metro system opened in 1979 the test centre closed and the track infrastructure was dismantled, leaving only the shed. The last BR line (Percy Main to Backworth) closed in 1983 and the tracks were <b>lifted,</b> <b>ending</b> over 200 years of railway use of the corridor.|$|R
