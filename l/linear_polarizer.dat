25|$|There {{are several}} ways to create circularly {{polarized}} light, the cheapest and most common involves placing a quarter-wave plate after a <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer</b> and directing unpolarized light through the <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer.</b> The linearly polarized light leaving the <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer</b> is transformed into circularly polarized light by the quarter wave plate.|$|E
25|$|When one {{attempts}} to pass unpolarized {{light through the}} <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer,</b> only light that has its electric field at the positive 45° angle leaves the <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer</b> and enters the quarter-wave plate. In the illustration, the three wavelengths of unpolarized light represented would be transformed into the three wavelengths of linearly polarized light {{on the other side}} of the <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer.</b>|$|E
25|$|To create right-handed, {{clockwise}} {{circularly polarized}} light one simply rotates {{the axis of}} the quarter-wave plate 90° relative to the <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer.</b> This reverses the fast and slow axes of the wave plate relative to the transmission axis of the <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer</b> reversing which component leads and which component lags.|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of interferometers with <b>linear</b> <b>polarizers</b> to the CMB E and B mode are variant under {{the rotation of}} the polarizer frame, while interferometer with circular polarizers are equally sensitive to E and B mode. We present analytically and numerically that the diagonal elements of window functions for CMB E/B power spectra are maximized in interferometric measurement of linear polarization, when the polarizer frame is in certain rotation from the associated baseline. We also present the simulated observation to show that the 1 -σ errors on E/B mode power spectrum estimation are variant under the polarizer frame rotation in the case of <b>linear</b> <b>polarizers,</b> while they are invariant in the case of circular polarizers. Simulation of the configuration similar to the DASI shows that minimum 1 -σ error on B mode in interferometer measurement with <b>linear</b> <b>polarizers</b> is 26...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{performance}} of OSCM transmission system using dual electrode MZ modulator was analyzed and investigated by simulation {{through the use of}} optisim software. The dual electrode z-cut LiNbO 3 MZM makes the use of two <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer’s</b> placed before and after it respectively. By carefully selecting the angles of the two <b>linear</b> <b>polarizers,</b> the third order intermodulation and harmonic distortion can be suppressed significantly. The performance of the system was investigated by varying few parameters such as data rate, optical modulation index, subcarrier frequency, phase shift difference between branches of dual electrode MZ modulator, fiber length and phase of the local oscillator at the receiver side...|$|R
25|$|To {{create a}} {{circular}} polarizer that instead passes right-handed polarized light and absorbs left-handed light, one again rotates the wave plate and <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer</b> 90° relative to each another. It {{is easy to}} appreciate that {{by reversing the positions}} of the transmitting and absorbing axes of the <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer</b> relative to the quarter-wave plate, one changes which handedness of polarized light gets transmitted and which gets absorbed.|$|E
25|$|In the {{arrangement}} above, the transmission {{axis of the}} <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer</b> is at a positive 45° angle relative to the right horizontal and is represented with an orange line. The quarter-wave plate has a horizontal slow axis and a vertical fast axis and they are also represented using orange lines. In this instance the unpolarized light entering the <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer</b> is displayed as a single wave whose amplitude and angle of linear polarization are suddenly changing.|$|E
25|$|The {{transmission}} {{axis of the}} <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer</b> {{needs to}} be half way (45°) between the fast and slow axes of the quarter-wave plate.|$|E

Analysis of polarized light is an important diagnostic tool in many applications including remote sensing, solar astronomy, atomic and molecular spectroscopy and material analysis. For example, solar magnetic field measurements can be obtained by polarization analysis of certain components of the solar spectrum. Surface roughness and anisotropy of materials can be determined by investigating the depolarization of light upon reflection.

25|$|Had it been right-handed, {{clockwise}} {{circularly polarized}} light approaching the circular polarizer from the left, its horizontal component would {{have also been}} retarded, however the resulting linearly polarized light would have been polarized along the absorbing axis of the <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer</b> {{and it would not}} have passed.|$|E
25|$|A {{homogeneous}} circular polarizer passes one handedness of {{circular polarization}} unaltered and blocks the other handedness. This {{is similar to}} the way that a <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer</b> would fully pass one angle of linearly polarized light unaltered, but would fully block any linearly polarized light that was orthogonal to it.|$|E
25|$|First {{note that}} a quarter-wave plate always {{transforms}} circularly polarized light into linearly polarized light. It is only the resulting angle of polarization of the linearly polarized light that {{is determined by the}} orientation of the fast and slow axes of the quarter-wave plate and the handedness of the circularly polarized light. In the illustration, the left-handed circularly polarized light entering the polarizer is transformed into linearly polarized light which has its direction of polarization along the transmission axis of the <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer</b> and it therefore passes. In contrast right-handed circularly polarized light would have been transformed into linearly polarized light that had its direction of polarization along the absorbing axis of the <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer,</b> which is at right angles to the transmission axis, and it would have therefore been blocked.|$|E

50|$|A typical polarimetric setup {{consists}} of two <b>linear</b> <b>polarizers</b> forming a crossed analyzer setup, an optical sample introducing {{the change in the}} polarization of light, and a PEM further modulating the polarization state. The final detected intensities at the fundamental and second harmonic of PEM operating frequency depend on the ellipticity and rotation introduced by the sample.|$|R
25|$|There is a {{relatively}} straightforward way to appreciate why a polarizer which creates a given handedness of circularly polarized light also passes that same handedness of polarized light. First, given the dual usefulness of this image, begin by imagining the circularly polarized light displayed at the top as still leaving the quarter-wave plate and traveling toward the left. Observe that had the horizontal component of the linearly polarized light been retarded by a quarter of wavelength twice, which would amount to a full half wavelength, the result would have been linearly polarized light that was at a right angle to the light that entered. If such orthogonally polarized light were rotated on the horizontal plane and directed back through the <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer</b> section of the circular polarizer it would clearly pass through given its orientation. Now imagine the circularly polarized light which has already passed through the quarter-wave plate once, turned around and directed back toward the circular polarizer again. Let the circularly polarized light illustrated at the top now represent that light. Such light is going to travel through the quarter-wave plate a second time before reaching the <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer</b> and in the process, its horizontal component {{is going to be}} retarded a second time by one quarter of a wavelength. Whether that horizontal component is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength in two distinct steps or retarded a full half wavelength all at once, the orientation of the resulting linearly polarized light will be such that it passes through the <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer.</b>|$|E
25|$|To {{understand}} this process, {{refer to the}} illustration on the right. It is absolutely identical to the earlier illustration even though the circularly polarized light at the top is now considered to be approaching the polarizer from the left. One can observe from the illustration that the leftward horizontal (as observed looking along the direction of travel) component is leading the vertical component and that when the horizontal component is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength it will be transformed into the linearly polarized light illustrated {{at the bottom and}} it will pass through the <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer.</b>|$|E
25|$|Generally speaking, and {{not making}} direct {{reference}} to the above illustration, when {{either of the two}} polarizations of circularly polarized light enters the first quarter-wave plate, one of a pair of orthogonal components is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength relative to the other. This creates one of two linear polarizations depending on the handedness the circularly polarized light. The <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer</b> sandwiched between the quarter wave plates is oriented so that it will pass one linear polarization and block the other. The second quarter-wave plate then takes the linearly polarized light that passes and retards the orthogonal component that was not retarded by the previous quarter-wave plate. This brings the two components back into their initial phase relationship, reestablishing the selected circular polarization.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{simplest}} <b>linear</b> <b>polarizers</b> is the wire-grid polarizer (WGP), which consists of many fine parallel metallic wires that are placed in a plane. WGPs mostly reflect the non-transmitted polarization and can thus be used as polarizing beam splitters. The parasitic absorption is relatively high compared {{to most of the}} dielectric polarizers though much lower than in absorptive polarizers.|$|R
40|$|Tunable {{multilayer}} <b>linear</b> <b>polarizers</b> extend magneto-optic rotation {{techniques that}} directly sense polarization changes into the 50 [...] 1, 000 eV range.

A tunable multilayer polarimeter is described, and examples of its use in early Kerr rotation hysteresis studies of Fe films and Fe/Cr multilayers are given...|$|R
40|$|The {{approaches}} to obtaining desired intensity or phase modulation by twisted-nematic {{liquid crystal display}} (TN-LCD) have been extensively studied based on {{the knowledge of the}} LCD&# 39;s internal structure parameters. Generally, the TN-LCD placed between two <b>linear</b> <b>polarizers</b> (P) produces coupled intensity and phase modulation. To obtain the commonly used phase-only modulation, quarter wave plates (QWPs) are often used in front of and/or behind the LCD. Here we present a method to optimize the optical modulation properties of the TN-LCD to obtain phase-only modulation in the configuration of P-QWP-LCD-QWP-P each with proper orientation. Our method is based on the macroscopical Jones matrix descriptions for the LCD, the QWPs, and the <b>linear</b> <b>polarizers.</b> Through Jones matrix calculations, the orientations of the polarizers and QWPs can be optimized to satisfy differently desired modulation demands. In contrast to the traditional method, which requires knowledge of the LCD&# 39;s internal structure parameters, our method simplified the complicated theory analysis and can work in the absence of information on the LCD&# 39;s internal structure parameters, which are usually not available for the commercial products...|$|R
25|$|A simple <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer</b> {{can be made}} by tilting a {{stack of}} glass plates at Brewster's angle to the beam. Some of the s-polarized light is {{reflected}} from each surface of each plate. For a stack of plates, each reflection depletes the incident beam of s-polarized light, leaving a greater fraction of p-polarized light in the transmitted beam at each stage. For visible light in air and typical glass, Brewster's angle is about 57°, and about 16% of the s-polarized light present in the beam is reflected for each air-to-glass or glass-to-air transition. It takes many plates to achieve even mediocre polarization of the transmitted beam with this approach. For a stack of 10 plates (20 reflections), about 3% (=(1-0.16)20) of the s-polarized light is transmitted. The reflected beam, while fully polarized, is spread out and may not be very useful.|$|E
2500|$|A {{homogeneous}} circular polarizer can {{be created}} by sandwiching a <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer</b> between two quarter-wave plates. [...] Specifically we take the circular polarizer described previously, which transforms circularly polarized light into linear polarized light, and add to it a second quarter-wave plate rotated 90° relative to the first one.|$|E
2500|$|A full-wave plate {{introduces}} a phase difference of exactly one wavelength {{between the two}} polarization directions, for one wavelength of light. In optical mineralogy, {{it is common to}} use a full-wave plate designed for green light (wavelength = 540nbsp&nm). Linearly polarized white light which passes through the plate becomes elliptically polarized, except for 540nbsp&nm light which will remain linear. If a <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer</b> oriented perpendicular to the original polarization is added, this green wavelength is fully extinguished but elements of the other colors remain. This means that under these conditions the plate will appear an intense shade of red-violet, sometimes known as [...] "sensitive tint". This gives rise to this plate's alternative names, the sensitive-tint plate or (less commonly) red-tint plate. These plates are widely used in mineralogy to aid in identification of minerals in thin sections of rocks.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two types}} of {{polarizing}} filters readily available, linear and [...] "circular", which have exactly the same effect photographically. But the metering and auto-focus sensors in certain cameras, including virtually all auto-focus SLRs, will not work properly with <b>linear</b> <b>polarizers</b> because the beam splitters used to split off the light for focusing and metering are polarization-dependent. Linearly-polarized light may also defeat the action of the Anti-aliasing filter (Low-pass filter) on the imaging sensor.|$|R
25|$|Certain crystals, due to {{the effects}} {{described}} by crystal optics, show dichroism, preferential absorption of light which is polarized in particular directions. They can therefore be used as <b>linear</b> <b>polarizers.</b> The best known crystal of this type is tourmaline. However, this crystal is seldom used as a polarizer, since the dichroic effect is strongly wavelength dependent and the crystal appears coloured. Herapathite is also dichroic, and is not strongly coloured, but is difficult to grow in large crystals.|$|R

2500|$|Ellipsometry {{can also}} be done as imaging {{ellipsometry}} by using a CCD camera as a detector. This provides a real time contrast image of the sample, which provides information about film thickness and refractive index. Advanced imaging ellipsometer technology operates {{on the principle of}} classical null ellipsometry and real-time ellipsometric contrast imaging. [...] Imaging ellipsometry is based on the concept of nulling. [...] In ellipsometry, the film under investigation is placed onto a reflective substrate. [...] The film and the substrate have different refractive indexes. [...] In order to obtain data about film thickness, the light reflecting off of the substrate must be nulled. [...] Nulling is achieved by adjusting the analyzer and polarizer so that all reflected light off of the substrate is extinguished. [...] Due to the difference in refractive indexes, this will allow the sample to become very bright and clearly visible. The light source consists of a monochromatic laser of the desired wavelength. A common wavelength that is used is 532nm green laser light. [...] Since only intensity of light measurements are needed, almost any type of camera can be implemented as the CCD, which is useful if building an ellipsometer from parts. [...] Typically, imaging ellipsometers are configured in such a way so that the laser (L) fires a beam of light which immediately passes through a <b>linear</b> <b>polarizer</b> (P). [...] The linearly polarized light then passes through a quarter wavelength compensator (C) which transforms the light into elliptically polarized light. [...] This elliptically polarized light then reflects off the sample (S), passes through the analyzer (A) and is imaged onto a CCD camera by a long working distance objective. The analyzer here is another polarizer identical to the P, however, this polarizer serves to help quantify the change in polarization and is thus given the name analyzer. [...] This design is commonly referred to as a LPCSA configuration.|$|E

25|$|Thin-film <b>linear</b> <b>polarizers</b> are glass {{substrates}} {{on which}} a special optical coating is applied. Either Brewster's angle reflections or interference effects in the film cause them to act as beam-splitting polarizers.
