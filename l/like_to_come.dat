5|$|In an {{interview}} with the San Francisco Chronicle, Damon revealed that he was asked to appear on the show by Sean Hayes, a friend of Damon's and the actor that plays Jack on Will & Grace. Damon enjoyed the idea for the episode and agreed to appear on the show. He commented that it was easy for him to get into character because he had previously played a gay character in the film The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999). Following his appearance, Damon told the Chicago Sun-Times in June 2002 that he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back and guest star.|$|E

25|$|As well {{as playing}} basketball, Mills also played underage Australian rules {{football}} {{at a high}} level. In 2004, Mills was competing for the Australian Capital Territory in the national schoolboys Australian rules tournament in Perth when a recruiter for the Sydney Swans asked him if he'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to Sydney and play in the Australian Football League (AFL). Mills briefly thought about taking up the Swans scholarship before rejecting it to concentrate on basketball. In 2005, he made a strong impression at the Australian Olympic Youth Festival, an event {{considered to be a}} showcase for future elite sporting talents.|$|E
25|$|American white {{pelicans}} <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{together in}} groups of {{a dozen or more}} birds to feed, as they can thus cooperate and corral fish to one another. When this is not easily possible – for example in deep water, where fish can escape by diving out of reach –, they prefer to forage alone. But the birds also steal food on occasion from other birds, a practice known as kleptoparasitism. White pelicans are known to steal fish from other pelicans, gulls and cormorants {{from the surface of the}} water and, in one case, from a great blue heron while both large birds were in flight.|$|E
500|$|When {{staff at}} the Rainbow told him of Corcoran's {{disappearance}} on 13 November, Smith telephoned the police station at Castle Vale saying that he wished to give a statement. Significantly, his call came at 4:00pm, before the body found in Worcestershire had been positively identified as Corcoran's, and within an hour Smith had presented himself at Castle Vale. Detective Constable Ruth Wilkins later recalled Smith's phone call: [...] "He said he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{to the police station}} to help with the inquiry and that he had seen [...] on Saturday night leave the pub with an unknown man. He insisted he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> over to the police station. He said he had been asked to contact the police by someone else and gave his mobile number." ...|$|E

Hearst and Welles's father were acquaintances, so Welles introduced himself and asked Hearst if he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to the opening. Hearst did not respond. [...] "As he was getting off at his floor, I said, 'Charles Foster Kane would have accepted.' No reply", recalled Welles. [...] "And Kane would have you know. That was his style—just as he finished Jed Leland's bad review of Susan as an opera singer." ...|$|E
500|$|This was Weezer's {{first album}} to feature a {{transparent}} CD tray. Under the CD tray of the album, the word [...] "No" [...] {{can be found}} on the back of the spine.

I'm full of enthusiasm. I'm going places. I'll be happy to help you. I am an important person, would you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> home with me?"

500|$|According to Pitchfork Media, record {{producer}} Larry Crane {{reported on}} his Tape Op message board {{that he had}} planned to help Smith mix his album in mid-November.

His girlfriend, Jennifer, called me [...] and asked if I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to L.A. and help mix and finish [...] I said 'yes, of course', and chatted with Elliott {{for the first time in}} ages. It seems surreal that he would call me to finish an album and then a week later kill himself.

500|$|In the stanza that follows, Helgi {{asks the}} valkyries (who {{he refers to}} as [...] "southern goddesses") if they would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> home with the warriors when night falls (all the while arrows were flying). The battle over, the valkyrie Sigrún ("victory-rune"), informs him from her horse that her father Högni has betrothed her to Höðbroddr, the son of king Granmar of the Hniflung clan, who Sigrún deems unworthy. Helgi assembles an immense host to ride to wage battle at Frekastein against the Hniflung clan to assist Sigrún in her plight to avoid her betrothment. Later in the poem, the hero Sinfjötli flyts with Guðmundr. Sinfjötli accuses Guðmundr of having once been female, and gibes that Guðmundr was [...] "a witch, horrible, unnatural, among Odin's valkyries", adding that all of the einherjar [...] "had to fight, headstrong woman, on your account". Further in the poem, the phrase [...] "the valkyrie's airy sea" [...] is used for [...] "mist".|$|E

2500|$|The JAMs' debut studio single [...] "All You Need Is Love" [...] {{dealt with}} the media {{coverage}} given to AIDS, sampling heavily from the Beatles' [...] "All You Need Is Love" [...] and Samantha Fox's [...] "Touch Me (I Want Your Body)". Although it was declined by distributors fearful of prosecution, and threatened with lawsuits, copies of the one-sided white label 12" [...] {{were sent to the}} music press; it received positive reviews and was made [...] "single of the week" [...] in Sounds. A later piece in the same magazine called the JAMs [...] "the hottest, most exhilarating band this year.... It's hard to understand what it feels <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> across something you believe to be totally new; I have never been so wholeheartedly convinced that a band are so good and exciting." ...|$|E
2500|$|In mid-June 2005, a {{software}} patch {{for the game}} dubbed the [...] "Hot Coffee mod" [...] was released by Patrick Wildenborg (under the Internet alias [...] "PatrickW"), a 38-year-old modder from the Netherlands. The name [...] "Hot Coffee" [...] refers {{to the way the}} released game alludes to the unseen sex scenes. In the unmodified game, the player takes his girlfriend to her front door and she asks him if he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in for [...] "some coffee". He agrees, and the camera stays outside, swaying back and forth a bit, while moaning sounds are heard. After installing the patch, users can enter the main character's girlfriends' houses and engage in a crudely rendered, fully clothed or nude sexual intercourse mini-game. The fallout from the controversy resulted in a public response from high-ranking politicians in the United States and elsewhere and resulted in the game's recall and re-release.|$|E
2500|$|The 1920s {{contained}} {{analysis of}} the poem that emphasised the poem's power. In Road to Xanadu (1927), a book length study of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and [...] "Kubla Khan", John Livingston Lowes claimed that the poems were [...] "two {{of the most remarkable}} poems in English". When turning to the background of the works, he argued, [...] "Coleridge as Coleridge, be it said at once, is a secondary moment to our purpose; it is the significant process, not the man, which constitutes our theme. But the amazing modus operandi of his genius, in the fresh light which I hope I have to offer, becomes the very abstract and brief chronicle of the procedure of the creative faculty itself." [...] After breaking down the various aspects of the poem, Lowes stated, [...] "with a picture of unimpaired and thrilling vividness, the fragment ends. And with it ends, for all save Coleridge, the dream. 'The earth hath bubbles as the water has, and this is of them.' For 'Kubla Khan' is as near enchantment, I suppose, as we are <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in this dull world. And over it is cast the glamour, enhanced beyond all reckoning in the dream, of the remote in time and space – that visionary presence of a vague and gorgeous and mysterious Past which brooded, as Coleridge read, above the inscrutable Nile, and domed pavilions in Cashmere, and the vanished stateliness of Xanadu." [...] He continued by describing the power of the poem: [...] "For none of the things which we have seen – dome, river, chasm, fountain, caves of ice, or floating hair – nor any combination of them holds the secret key to that sense of an incommunicable witchery which pervades the poem. That is something more impalpable by far, into which entered who can tell what tracelesss, shadowy recollections ... The poem is steeped in the wonder of all Coleridge's enchanted voyagings." [...] Lowes then concluded about the two works: [...] "Not even in the magical four and fifty lines of 'Kubla Khan' is sheer visualizing energy so intensely exercised as in 'The Ancient Mariner.' But every crystal-clear picture there, {{is an integral part of}} a preconceived and consciously elaborated whole ... In 'Kubla Khan' the linked and interweaving images irresponsibly and gloriously stream, like the pulsing, fluctuating banners of the North. And their pageant is as aimless as it is magnificent ... There is, then ... one glory of 'Kubla Khan' and another glory of 'The Ancient Mariner,' as one star differeth from another star in glory." [...] George Watson, in 1966, claimed that Lowes's {{analysis of the}} poems [...] "will stand as a permanent monument to historical criticism." [...] Also in 1966, Kenneth Burke, declared, [...] "Count me among those who would view this poem both as a marvel, and as 'in principle' finished" ...|$|E
