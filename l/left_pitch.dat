50|$|Ruddervators {{provide the}} same control effect as {{conventional}} control surfaces, but through a more complex control system that actuates the control surfaces in unison. Yaw moving the nose to the left is produced on an upright V tail by moving the pedals left which deflects the left-hand ruddervator down and left and the right-hand ruddervator up and left. The opposite produces yaw to the right. Pitch nose up is produced by moving the control column or stick back which deflects the left-hand ruddervator up and right and the right-hand ruddervator up and <b>left.</b> <b>Pitch</b> nose down is produced by moving the control column or stick forward which induces the opposite ruddervator movements.|$|E
50|$|The Panthers {{came into}} Week 5 again craving a win {{to get their}} season back on track. This time they were facing the former super bowl champions, the New Orleans Saints. The Saints were leading 10-0 with 3:04 {{left in the first}} quarter when Cam Newton threw a pass to wide {{receiver}} Steve Smith for a 54-yard touchdown after the touchdown Roman Harper was called for unnecessary roughness in the endzone. There would be a short fight after the play, and Olindo Mare would miss the extra point, it being blocked. With 4:01 left in the second quarter, the Panthers were trailing 17-6. Not when DeAngelo Williams took a <b>left</b> <b>pitch</b> from Cam Newton for a 69-yard score, Williams' first touchdown since 2009. Right before halftime, with 0:10 left, Sean Payton was trying to get the field goal unit out on the field for a John Kasay 46-yard field goal. Ron Rivera took a timeout because he thought he had too many men on the field, which would cost them a field goal which put the Saints up, 20-13. With 2:36 left in the third quarter, on a 2nd and 8, score 23-20 Saints, Drew Brees was intercepted by Sherrod Martin. Off of the interception, with 12:40 left in the game, on a 3rd and goal, Newton found Greg Olsen for a 5-yard touchdown to put the Panthers up 27-23. With 0:56 left in the game, Brees threw a short pass to Pierre Thomas for a six-yard score. Saints go up, 30-27. With 0:27 left, on a fourth-and-10, Cam Newton's pass is incomplete, intended for Greg Olsen, but there was a pass interference call on Roman Harper which set up a Panthers first down. Then, on a 3rd and 12 with 0:05 remaining, Cam Newton's pass, intended for Steve Smith is incomplete. With the close loss the Panthers fell to 1-4 on the season, though only being outscored 119-132 on the season.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an initial {{analysis on the}} use of electroencephalography and electromyography to control the thrust settings of a quadrotor. The OpenBCI neural interface is used to sample muscle activity on a subject's face. Signal processing and event detection algorithms are implemented to identify eyewinks, and these wink events modify the thrust commands in a high fidelity, nonlinear quadrotor simulation. Currently only right and left wink events are detected; these can be mapped to two quadrotor commands such as fly up and down, roll right and <b>left,</b> <b>pitch</b> up and down, or yaw right and left. The ultimate goal of this project is to create a low-cost brain-machine interface system to fully control a real quadrotor using only bioelectrical signals such as electroencephalography and electromyography. A successful demonstration of the OpenBCI system may result in brain-machine interfaces {{that can be used in}} the development of low-cost prosthetic arms and legs...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{our project}} is to design, {{construct}} and test an ROV that responds dependably to user commands. This task involves designing the physical structure of the ROV, its propulsion system, and its navigation system. We used the Seafox, a simple ROV whose designers published instructions for its construction [1], {{as a basis for}} our vehicle's structure. Our project involves slight modifications to the Seafox's physical configuration and great expansion upon its control unit. We have created control circuitry that operates the ROV's bilge pump propulsion system and is compatible with a joystick command interface for real-time control. Our design allows the ROV to maneuver along 5 axes (forward, backward, right, <b>left,</b> <b>pitch,</b> and yaw - Figure 2). An on-board camera provides visual feedback from the ROV to aid in navigation and exploration, and sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes are included for use in localization. The ROV serves as a platform upon which other sensors and/or mechanical components can be mounted for further work in underwater environments...|$|E

2500|$|Dalkowski's {{claim to}} fame was the high {{velocity}} of his fastball. Accurate measurements {{at the time were}} difficult to make, but the consensus is that Dalkowski regularly threw well above 100 miles per hour. Dalkowski's raw speed was aided by his highly flexible <b>left</b> (<b>pitching)</b> arm, and by his unusual [...] "buggy-whip" [...] pitching motion, which ended in a cross-body arm swing. [...] "I hit my left elbow on my right knee so often, they finally made me a pad to wear", recalled Dalkowski.|$|R

50|$|Jochum {{entered the}} league in 1943 and spent her entire six-year career with the South Bend Blue Sox, one of two teams to play in every AAGPBL season, being the other the Rockford Peaches. Jochum {{appeared}} at center field and <b>left,</b> <b>pitched,</b> and also played first base {{for a long time}} when the regular was hurt. Interestingly, because she played in a league that progressively expanded the length of the base paths and pitching distance and decreased the size of the ball until the final year of play in the 1954 season. Incidentally, the relatively low batting averages in the early years reflect mainly the high quality of AAGPBL pitchers, rather than a lack of skills by the hitters.|$|R

50|$|On April 21, Sale {{was placed}} on the 15-day {{disabled}} list after sustaining a flexor strain in his <b>left</b> (<b>pitching)</b> elbow. During his first start off the disabled list against the New York Yankees on May 22, 2014, Sale retired the first 17 batters in a row before allowing a single by Zoilo Almonte. He struck out 10 in 6 innings pitched as the White Sox won the game 3-2. During a game against the Angels on June 7, 2014, Sale had a 5-0 lead but surrendered 5 runs all in the 7th inning that featured a grand slam by Mike Trout. Sale continued his dominance on the mound, winning eight of his first nine decisions and carrying a 8-1 record and 2.08 ERA into the All-Star break.|$|R
5000|$|Bale {{appeared}} in 26 games for Kansas City in , all in relief. He had a 1-1 {{record with a}} 4.05 earned run average, surrendering 45 hits in 40 innings. He began the [...] season in the Royals' starting rotation after a strong spring training. [...] "Bale earned it," [...] Royals manager Trey Hillman said to the Kansas City Star on March 25. [...] "Johnny has been outstanding all through spring training. He's been hit in spots but, pretty much, from day one he's commanded three pitches." [...] In {{one of the more}} bizarre instances in recent Royals history, Bale, who was already on the disabled list due to a shoulder injury, broke his <b>left</b> (<b>pitching)</b> hand in May 2010 when he punched a hotel door in what Bale called [...] "a moment of frustration." ...|$|R
