5|$|Frogs {{are much}} more vocal, {{especially}} during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates. The presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself. In most species, the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an air sac or sacs in the throat or {{at the corner of}} the mouth. This may distend <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>balloon</b> and acts as a resonator, helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere, or the water at times when the animal is submerged. The main vocalisation is the male's loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage a female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory. This call is modified to a quieter courtship call on the approach of a female or to a more aggressive version if a male intruder draws near. Calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy. Other calls include those given by a female in response to the advertisement call and a release call given by a male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus. When a frog is attacked, a distress or fright call is emitted, often resembling a scream. The usually nocturnal Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) produces a rain call when there is rainfall during daylight hours.|$|E
25|$|For an {{explosion}} in the atmosphere, the fireball quickly expands to maximum size, and then begins to cool as it rises <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>balloon</b> through buoyancy in the surrounding air. As it does so it takes on the flow pattern of a vortex ring with incandescent material in the vortex core as seen in certain photographs. This effect is known as a mushroom cloud.|$|E
500|$|McCay {{began work}} that May {{on his next}} {{animated}} film, How a Mosquito Operates, based on a Rarebit Fiend episode from June 5, 1909, in which a man in bed tries in vain to defend himself from a giant mosquito, which drinks itself so full that it explodes. [...] The animation is naturalistic—rather than expanding <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>balloon,</b> with each sip of blood the mosquito's abdomen swells according to its body structure. [...] The film was completed in January 1912, and McCay toured with it that spring and summer.|$|E

500|$|Rather {{than merely}} {{expanding}} <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>balloon,</b> as the mosquito drinks its abdomen fills consistent with its bodily structure in a naturalistic way. [...] The heavier it becomes, the more difficulty it has keeping its balance. [...] In its excitement as it feeds, it does push-ups on the man's nose and flips its {{hat in the}} air. [...] The mosquito has a personality: egotistical, persistent, and calculating (as when it whets its proboscis on a stone wheel). [...] It makes eye contact with the viewers and waves at them. [...] McCay balances horror with humor, as when the mosquito finds itself so engorged with blood that it must lie down.|$|E
500|$|Put {{together}} in December 1911, and released in 1912, McCay's second film (also known as The Story of a Mosquito) {{is one of}} the earliest examples of line-drawn animation. [...] A giant top-hatted mosquito flies in through a window to feed on a man in bed, who tries in vain to defend himself. [...] The mosquito drinks itself so full that it explodes. [...] Rather than expanding <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>balloon,</b> the mosquito fills up in a naturalistic fashion according to its body structure. [...] The idea for the film came from a Rarebit Fiend strip published on June 5, 1909. [...] McCay biographer John Canemaker commends McCay for his ability to imbue the mosquito with character and a personality.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Aguilera {{wearing a black}} velvet kimono, with a pale {{complexion}} and long black hair, refers to a larva. Initially, she is trapped in a glass box, and her kimono is billowing <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>balloon.</b> Three Gothic ballerinas eat fruit and then collapse. Aguilera then breaks free from the box by pounding on it until it shatters. She furiously removes three moth pins from her back, and then tosses aside her kimono. A tattered, white, moth-covered dress is revealed, symbolizing her metaphoric evolution from the larva to a pupa. In addition, her hair becomes white, and moths fly around her. Near the end, Aguilera wears an Elvira-type spider dress, again proclaiming {{that she is a}} [...] "fighter".|$|E

500|$|By {{the late}} 1940s {{it was known}} that the {{properties}} of atomic nuclei could not {{be explained by the}} then-current models such as the liquid drop model developed by Niels Bohr amongst others. [...] The shell model, developed in 1949 by Maria Goeppert-Mayer and others, allowed some additional features to be explained, in particular the so-called magic numbers. However, there were also properties that could not be explained, including the non-spherical distribution of charge in certain nuclei. In a 1950 paper, James Rainwater of Columbia University suggested a variant of the drop model of the nucleus that could explain a non-spherical charge distribution. Rainwater's model postulated a nucleus <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>balloon</b> with balls inside that distort the surface as they move about. He discussed the idea with Bohr, who was visiting Columbia at the time, and had independently conceived the same idea, and had, about a month after Rainwater's submission, submitted for publication a paper that discussed the same problem, but along more general lines. Bohr imagined a rotating, irregular-shaped nucleus with a form of surface tension. Bohr developed the idea further, in 1951 publishing a paper that comprehensively treated the relationship between oscillations of the surface of the nucleus and the movement of the individual nucleons.|$|E
500|$|While Pixar usually designs their {{characters}} to be caricatured, Carl {{was even more}} so, being only three heads high. He was not given elderly features such as liver spots or hair in his ears to keep him appealing, yet giving him wrinkles, pockmarks on his nose, a hearing aid, and a cane to make him appear elderly. Docter wanted to push a stylized feel, particularly the way Carl's head is proportioned: he has a squarish appearance to symbolize his containment within his house, while Russell is rounded <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>balloon.</b> The challenge on Up was making these stylized characters feel natural, although Docter remarked the effect came across better than animating the realistic humans from Toy Story, who suffered from the [...] "uncanny valley". Cartoonists Al Hirschfeld, Hank Ketcham, and George Booth influenced the human designs. Simulating realistic cloth on caricatured humans was harder than creating the 10,000 balloons flying the house. New programs were made to simulate the cloth and for Kevin's iridescent feathers. To animate old people, Pixar animators would study their own parents or grandparents and also watched footage of the Senior Olympics. The directors had various rules for Carl's movements: he could not turn his head more than 15–20degrees without turning his torso as well, nor could he raise his arms high. However, they also wanted him to grow more flexible {{near the end of}} the film, transforming into an [...] "action hero".|$|E

2500|$|Known as the Balloon Pokémon, Jigglypuff {{is shaped}} like a round ball, with pink skin, large blue or green eyes, catlike ears, and a tuft of fur on its forehead. Its skin is rubbery and stretchy. It can inflate its body <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>balloon</b> (usually when it becomes angry; this is {{accompanied}} by a distinctive [...] "honk" [...] sound), or flatten its body, much like fellow Nintendo character Kirby. An exact limit to the size it can grow to in this manner is unknown. Jigglypuff are characterized by putting their enemies to sleep by singing a lullaby. Before beginning to sing, they mesmerize the opponent with their soft, glowing eyes, and if they inflate themselves, they can sing for longer periods of time. They can easily adjust the wavelength of their voices to that of the brain waves of a sleeping being, allowing for their pleasing melody to put its audience to sleep. They sing without pausing to take a breath, so if the opponent is resistant to sleeping, they potentially run out of air. Game Freak's staff have noted Jigglypuff as both one of their and the public's favorite Pokémon, in terms of both anime and video game appearances.|$|E

2500|$|The colon is {{wrinkled}} and corrugated, {{somewhat like}} an accordion or a clothes-dryer exhaust tube, which gives it the {{large surface area}} needed for water absorption. [...] In order to inspect this surface thoroughly the physician blows it up <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>balloon,</b> using an air compressor, {{in order to get}} the creases out. [...] The stomach, intestines and colon have a so-called [...] "second brain" [...] wrapped around them, which autonomously runs the chemical factory of digestion. [...] It uses complex hormone signals and nerve signals to communicate with the brain and the rest of the body. [...] Normally a colon's job is to digest food and regulate the intestinal flora. [...] The harmful bacteria in rancid food, for example, creates gas. The colon has distension sensors that can tell when there is unexpected gas pushing the colon walls out—thus the [...] "second brain" [...] tells the person that he or she is having intestinal difficulties by way of the sensation of nausea. [...] Doctors typically recommend either total anaesthesia or a partial twilight sedative to either preclude or to lessen the patient's awareness of pain or discomfort, or just the unusual sensations of the procedure. [...] Once the colon has been inflated, the doctor inspects it with the scope as it is slowly pulled backwards. [...] If any polyps are found they are then cut out for later biopsy.|$|E

40|$|The {{interpretation}} of electron cyclotron emission (ECE) {{signal from the}} optically marginal region of magnetized plasma is presented.

Synthetic ECE signals from the rotating ELM are calculated {{based on the measured}} electron temperature profile and an assumed electron density profile constrained by the measured line-averaged density, yielding an ~ 0. 02 relative fluctuation level in agreement with the experimental observations.
