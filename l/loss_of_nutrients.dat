25|$|Fire {{may cause}} changes in soil {{nutrients}} {{through a variety}} of mechanisms, including oxidation, volatilization, erosion, and leaching by water. Temperatures must be very high, however, to cause a significant <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>nutrients,</b> which are often replaced by organic matter left behind in the fire. Also, the minerals which were formerly part of slowly decaying plant matter become more soluble and available in the ash.

25|$|Spinach is {{packaged}} in air, or in nitrogen gas to extend shelf life. Some packaged spinach {{is exposed to}} radiation to kill any harmful bacteria that {{may be on the}} leaves. The Food and Drug Administration approves of irradiation of spinach leaves up to 4.0 kilograys; however, using radiation to sanitize spinach is of concern because it may deplete the leaves of their nutritional value. Researchers at the Agricultural Research Service experimentally tested the concentrations of vitamins C, E, K, B9, and four carotenoids in packaged spinach following irradiation. They found with increasing level of irradiation, four nutrients showed little or no change. Those nutrients include vitamins B9, E, K, and the carotenoid neoxanthin. This study showed the irradiation of packaged spinach to have little or no change to the nutritional value of the crop, and the health benefits of irradiating packed spinach to reduce harmful bacteria seem to outweigh the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>nutrients.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Throughout history, and {{especially}} {{prior to the}} 20th century, there have been those who have held that sexual abstinence confers numerous health benefits. For males, lack of abstinence was thought to cause a reduction of vitality. In modern times, the argument has been phrased in biological terms, claiming that loss of semen through ejaculation results in a depletion of vital nutrients such as lecithin and phosphorus, which are also found at high levels in the brain. Conservation of the semen allegedly allows it to be reabsorbed back into the bloodstream and aid in the healthy development of the body. [...] Along these lines, the noted German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche spoke of the positive physiological effects of abstinence: [...] "The reabsorption of semen by the blood ... perhaps prompts the stimulus of power, the unrest of all forces towards the overcoming of resistances ... The feeling of power has so far mounted highest in abstinent priests and hermits" [...] (quoted by Walter Kaufman in his classic, Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist, p.222). Before the [...] "sexual revolution" [...] of the 1960s, it was commonly believed {{by members of the}} medical profession that numerous mental and physical diseases in men were caused primarily by <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>nutrients</b> through seminal discharge, and that the deliberate conservation of this substance would lead to increased health, vitality, and intellectual prowess.

40|$|African savannas {{developed}} an efficient strategy <b>of</b> <b>nutrient</b> uptake {{and control of}} nitrification {{making it possible to}} avoid large <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>nutrient</b> by drainage. The conversion of native savanna into commercial forest plantations is an important global change driver that potentially impacts element cycles. Afforestation of native Congolese savannas by Eucalyptus started 30 years ago. Large amounts <b>of</b> <b>nutrients</b> are removed through biomass harvesting every 6 - 7 years. <b>Losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>nutrients</b> by deep drainage might be a serious threat for the sustainability of these plantations, established on sandy soils with high hydraulic conductivities. We compared the soil N-mineralisation, the nutrient fluxes and deep drainage beneath savanna and Eucalyptus plantation in Congo. Then, we discussed the strategy <b>of</b> <b>nutrient</b> recycling. The water fluxes at a depth of 400 cm were approximately 20 % higher in the savanna than in Eucalyptus plantation. Although the nitrification rate and solution chemistry exhibited strong modifications during the first year following both savanna afforestation and the harvesting of the Eucalyptus stand, the <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>nutrients</b> by deep drainage remained unexpectedly low. The largest fluxes of drainage at a depth of 6 m were found for NH 4 +-N, which reached a maximum of 0. 4 g m(- 2) yr(- 1) in the second year following savanna afforestation and I g m(- 2) yr(- 1) in the first year after clear cutting. The deep drainage of NO 3 [...] N, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 + and K+ did not exceed 0. 2 g m(- 2) yr(- 1) in the savanna and at any stage of plantation development. These results are discussed regarding (i) the roots distribution in the soil of each ecosystem and (ii) the nutrient accumulation in biomass. The limited changes between the nutrient fluxes in both ecosystems were the result of fast root growth in the deep soil layers after planting, combined with an intense uptake of the tree roots to satisfy the large nutrient and water requirements for the development of tree crowns. Intense uptake and cycling <b>of</b> <b>nutrients</b> mitigated the risk due to clear cut and N fertilisation in this forest plantation. Nevertheless, forest managers must carefully fit fertilisation regimes to the <b>nutrient</b> requirements <b>of</b> new clone selected by breeding programmes and reduce as much as possible the delay between harvesting and re-planting to avoid high losses by deep drainage.
