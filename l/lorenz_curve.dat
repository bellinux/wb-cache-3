40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of ranking <b>Lorenz</b> <b>curves</b> in situations where the <b>Lorenz</b> <b>curves</b> intersect and no unambiguous ranking can be attained without introducing weaker ranking criteria than first-degree Lorenz dominance. To deal with such situations Aaberge (2009) introduced two alternative sequences of nested dominance criteria for <b>Lorenz</b> <b>curves</b> which was proved to characterize two separate systems of nested subfamilies of inequality measures. This paper uses the obtained characterization results to arrange the members of two different generalized Gini families of inequality measures into subfamilies according to their relationship to Lorenz dominance of various degrees. Since the various criteria of higher degree Lorenz dominance provide convenient computational methods, these results can be used to identify the largest subfamily of the generalized Gini families and thus the least restrictive social preferences required to reach unambiguous ranking of a set of <b>Lorenz</b> <b>curves.</b> From the weight-functions of these inequality measures we obtain intuitive interpretations of higher degree Lorenz dominance, which generally has been viewed as difficult to interpret because they involve assumptions about third and higher derivatives. To demonstrate the usefulness of these methods for empirical applications, we examine the time trend in income and earnings inequality of Norwegian males during the period 1967 - 2005...|$|R

40|$|The Gini {{index is}} a measure of the {{inequality}} of a distribution that can be derived from <b>Lorenz</b> <b>curves.</b> While commonly used in, e. g., economic research, it suffers from ambiguity via lack of Lorenz dominance preservation. Here, investigation of large sets of empirical distributions of incomes of the World’s countries over several years indicated firstly, that the Gini indices are centered on a value of 33. 33 % corresponding to the Gini index of the uniform distribution and secondly, that the <b>Lorenz</b> <b>curves</b> of these distributions are consistent with <b>Lorenz</b> <b>curves</b> of log-normal distributions. This can be employed to provide a Lorenz dominance preserving equivalent of the Gini index. Therefore, a modified measure based on log-normal approximation and standardization of <b>Lorenz</b> <b>curves</b> is proposed. The so-called UGini index provides a meaningful and intuitive standardization on the uniform distribution as this characterizes societies that provide equal chances. The novel UGini index preserves Lorenz dominance. Analysis of the probability density distributions of the UGini index of the World’s counties income data indicated multimodality in two independent data sets. Applying Bayesian statistics provided a data-based classification of the World’s countries’ income distributions. The UGini index can be re-transferred into the classical index to preserve comparability with previous research...|$|R
40|$|The Lorenz {{dominance}} is {{a primary}} tool for comparison of non-negative distributions in terms of inequality. However, in most of cases <b>Lorenz</b> <b>curves</b> intersect and the ordering is not fulfilled, so that some alternative (weaker) criteria need to be to introduced. In this context, the second-degree Lorenz dominance, which emphasizes {{the role of the}} left (or right) tail of the distribution, is especially suitable for ranking single-crossing <b>Lorenz</b> <b>curves.</b> We introduce a new ordering, namely disparity dominance, which emphasizes inequality in both of the tails, and we show that, in turn, it is especially suitable for ranking double-crossing <b>Lorenz</b> <b>curves.</b> We argue that the two approaches are basically complementary, although in both cases the Gini coefficient is crucial for the ranking. Moreover, we can use some well-known results of majorization theory to obtain classes of functionals that are consistent with the aforementioned weak preorders, and that can therefore be used as finer inequality indices.
