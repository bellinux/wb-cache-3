500|$|... "Million Reasons" [...] {{is written}} in the key of C major with its tempo {{swinging}} around 64 beats per minute, and is accompanied by piano and guitar. Gaga's vocals span from G3 to E5 in the song, which in common time, follows a progression of C–Am–F–G, with a chorus of F–C–Am–G. During the song's chorus, Gaga croons [...] "You're giving me a million reasons to <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> / You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show". Its discussion of heartbreak and hope, as described by International Business Timess Nicholas Mojica, was guaranteed to [...] "resonate with [...] listeners" [...] of the record. Bustles Amy Roberts theorized that, {{like most of the}} songs from Joanne, [...] "Million Reasons" [...] had extra hidden depth in its lyrics and predicted it to be about Gaga's separated boyfriend Taylor Kinney. The phrase [...] "quit the show" [...] was described as a metaphor by Roberts about Gaga feeling dejected about her life, with the second verses confirming this. Both romantic heartbreak as catalyst and religious faith of the singer were represented as different sides of the lyrics. Roberts concluded by saying that [...] "hough the song may seem extremely fraught with sadness, confusion and heartache, its main message appears to be a pretty positive one".|$|E

[...] Later in the season, Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand) tries to shoot Michael in the head, but the gun jams and the next day, {{a manifestation of the}} island in the form of Christian Shephard (John Terry) appears before Michael. Damon Lindelof confirmed that the island's [...] "cosmic intervention of fate" [...] also played a part in the car crash that foiled Jack's suicide attempt in the third-season finale. Following the broadcast of the fourth midseason premiere, Lindelof further confirmed that this island force prevents Ben and Widmore from dying. Cuse has said that [...] "There is a raging debate on the show about what constitutes free will and what constitutes destiny and Michael's story was sort of a argument on the destiny side of that equation. He had more destiny to fulfil with that island than he anticipated and maybe the audience anticipated." [...] Elizabeth Sarnoff stated that [...] "the island doesn't <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> until it's done with you and I think that the rest of our characters are going to feel the reverberations of that, as well." ...|$|E

2500|$|One Day is a sparse, tersely written {{narrative}} {{of a single}} day of the ten-year labor camp imprisonment of a fictitious Soviet prisoner, Ivan Denisovich Shukhov. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had first-hand experience in the Gulag system, having been imprisoned from 1945 to 1953 for writing derogatory comments in letters to friends about {{the conduct of the}} war by Joseph Stalin, whom he referred to by epithets [...] such as [...] "the master" [...] and [...] "the boss". Solzhenitsyn claimed the prisoners wept when news of Stalin's death reached them. He uses the epithet [...] "old man whiskers" [...] in his novel, where it is translated as [...] "Old Whiskers" [...] or [...] "Old Man Whiskers". This title was considered offensive and derogatory, but prisoners were free to call Stalin whatever they liked: [...] "Somebody in the room was bellowing: 'Old Man Whiskers won't ever <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>go!</b> He wouldn't trust his own brother, let alone a bunch of cretins like you!" [...] Drafts of stories found in Solzhenitsyn's map case were used to incriminate him (Frangsmyr, 1993).|$|E

[...] Barbara Lesko wrote, [...] "She was a great help to Egyptian scholars, especially Hassan and Fakhry, correcting their English and writing English language articles for others. So this poorly educated Englishwoman developed in Egypt into a first rate draughtswoman and prolific and talented writer who, even under her own name, produced articles, essays, monographs and books of great range, wit and substance." [...] William Golding wrote of the Egyptologists he met in his travels through Egypt in the 1980s who were [...] "as well disposed to the Mystery as any child could have wished." [...] When [...] "the question arose of a dear lady who believed herself to have been a priestess of a particular temple, they did not dismiss her as a crackpot but agreed that she had something." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, [...] "End of Time" [...] is a {{declaration}} of co-dependence; Knowles professes her everlasting love to her romantic interest. As stated by Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic, [...] "At the start, she's stricken by her own emotional vulnerability; by the end, she's empowered by it." [...] The song opens with [...] "spitfire drums" [...] while Knowles sings in an almost distorted fashion, with her vocals layered underneath until a [...] "dramatic explosion". As her vocals continue to build up, Knowles airily chants: [...] "Come take my hand / I won’t <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> / I’ll be your friend / I will love you so deeply / I {{will be the one}} to kiss you at night / I will love you till the end of time." [...] She continues her appeal as she sings to her love interest, [...] "Take you away from here / There's nothing between us but space and time". On the bridge, Knowles belts her vocal lines over a shooting horn sequence; with her multiple-layered vocals, she commands, [...] "Boy come to me", and towards the end, she repeatedly sings, [...] "Say you’ll never let me go". Knowles [...] "finds the strength in two" [...] as she affirms to her romantic interest, [...] "I just wanna be with you / I just wanna live for you / I'd never let you go!".|$|E
2500|$|Jesse is an Australian {{resistance}} sailor and Derek Reese's love interest. In her timeline, she {{sailed to}} Australia to deliver supplies aboard the upgraded nuclear submarine , captained by a reprogrammed Terminator, Queeg, {{of which she}} is the executive officer. Queeg diverts the submarine {{to pick up a}} package and return it to John Connor. Her crew is curious of what is in the package so they open it. Inside is a T-1001 and one of the crew members, a woman, points her gun at it. The T-1001 kills her and takes her form, then shakes its finger at the rest of the crew. Queeg kills a crewman after he beat on Jesse. Jesse does not trust Queeg so she relieves him of command. Queeg does not obey her orders so she terminates him and destroys the submarine in an attempt to kill the T-1001. On her way out, she encounters the T-1001 and it tells her, [...] "the answer is no." [...] In 2007, she is on a possibly self-imposed mission to find and stop Cameron from adversely influencing young John, by recruiting Riley Dawson in the future and bringing her back to frame Cameron for her murder. In the future from which Jesse comes, John has withdrawn from humans and speaks only with Cameron. It is unclear whether this mission is self-appointed, but comments by her and the fact she was able to access the time travel machinery with Riley suggests others in the Resistance leadership group may share her concerns about Cameron's influence on John. John Connor later figures out that Jesse killed Riley and informs Derek, but orders her life to be spared. Derek confronts Jesse. He tells her that they are from two different futures and that he doesn't know who she is. He tells her, [...] "John Connor wanted to <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>go.</b> I'm not John Connor." [...] He pulls his gun on her and she takes off running. Whether or not Derek actually kills her is left ambiguous, although he does pull the trigger on his handgun. When asked about it by John he just says, [...] "John Connor wanted to let her go." [...] This could either mean that he obeyed John Connor's order or since he is not John Connor, he didn't want to let her go and he shot her. Later on in a flashback, Cameron is seen talking to Jesse. Cameron tells her that she is sorry for her loss. She says that the pressure from leaving the submarine killed her baby, she was pregnant with Derek's baby. Jesse tells Cameron, [...] "Tell John Connor it said [...] "The answer is no"" [...] Then, Jesse asks Cameron, [...] "If the answer is no, what was the question?" [...] Cameron answers with, [...] "Will you join us?" [...] Cameron tells Derek about the miscarriage and he says he never had any kids.|$|E
