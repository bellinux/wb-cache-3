5|$|Although the Rivière des Prairies is {{much smaller}} than the Saint Lawrence, bridge {{construction}} there did not begin until the 1840s—when rapid construction began on three wooden toll bridges to what is now <b>Laval,</b> one of which, Pont des Saints-Anges, collapsed in the 1880s and was never rebuilt. The existence of regular ferry services across the river is attested from 1813, but these ferries were discontinued when the bridges opened. The first railroad across the river was opened in 1876, and the Bordeaux Railway Bridge is the oldest fixed link to <b>Laval</b> that is still standing. (Another bridge across Rivière des Mille Îles, which was part of the same line, collapsed in 1882 but was immediately rebuilt.) The highway construction boom of the 1960s and 1970s led to the construction of four new freeway bridges across the river, and the upgrading of the existing Pie IX Bridge to freeway standards.|$|E

5|$|The Hoare–Laval Pact of December 1935 was {{an attempt}} by the British Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare and the French Prime Minister Pierre <b>Laval</b> to end the {{conflict}} in Abyssinia by proposing to partition the country into an Italian sector and an Abyssinian sector. Mussolini was prepared to agree to the pact, but news of the deal leaked out. Both the British and French public vehemently protested against it, describing it as a sell-out of Abyssinia. Hoare and <b>Laval</b> were forced to resign, and the British and French governments dissociated themselves from the two men. In June 1936, although there was no precedent for a head of state addressing the Assembly of the League of Nations in person, Haile Selassie spoke to the Assembly, appealing for its help in protecting his country.|$|E

5|$|Diarra {{made his}} debut for Le Havre on 17 August 2002 in the team's 1–1 draw with Strasbourg {{appearing}} as a substitute. He {{was a frequent}} starter {{for the majority of}} the fall season, but, following the winter break, began appearing primarily as a substitute. In September 2002, Diarra's contract dispute with Louhans-Cuiseaux came into the spotlight after his former club admitted that the player was reportedly banned from playing in France professionally for three years due to moving abroad without Louhans-Cuiseaux receiving a trainers' compensation fee. Louhans-Cuiseaux reported the situation to FIFA, however, the organization ruled in favor of Diarra who was allowed to continue his career with Le Havre. Diarra scored his first professional goal on 25 January 2003 in a 2–1 defeat to <b>Laval</b> in the Coupe de France. He finished the campaign with 28 total appearances.|$|E

The ship's most notable mission was when she transported former Italian Premier Benito Mussolini from Ponza Island to La Maddalena, Sardinia on 6 August. The ship was scuttled at La Spezia on 9 September 1943 following the Italian armistice and broken up after the war.|$|E
