5|$|In 1999, 25 {{years after}} the end of their relationship, Joyce Maynard {{auctioned}} a series of letters Salinger had written her. Maynard's memoir of her life and her relationship with Salinger, At Home in the World: A Memoir, was published the same year. Among other topics, the book described how Maynard's mother had consulted with her on how to appeal to the aging author (who was dressing <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>child),</b> and described Joyce's relationship with him at length. In the ensuing controversy over both the memoir and the letters, Maynard claimed that she was forced to auction the letters for financial reasons; she would have preferred to donate them to the Beinecke Library. Software developer Peter Norton bought the letters for US$156,500 and announced his intention to return them to Salinger.|$|E

He takes her away to Ketti, where he is working as a school teacher. He takes her to his residence, where he protects her and also pampers her <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> Viji, as she is called by Cheenu, has completely forgotten her past and becomes very close to him. When Viji accidentally spills ink over Cheenu's documents, angering him, their relationship is threatened, but they reconcile. Later, a local woodcutter named Nataraj lusts for Viji and nearly assaults her, but she manages to save herself. When she tells Cheenu about it, he becomes livid with rage and almost kills Nataraj, but is stopped by his neighbours who were informed of the incident by Viji. Meanwhile, the wife of Cheenu's headmaster is attracted to Cheenu, though he does not reciprocate her feelings.|$|E

Due to the lack of exposure to sunlight, she also had a very light skin tone and suffered from jaundice.

500|$|Matt Zoller Seitz of The New York Times saw Rhona Mitra's {{character}} {{as a mere}} impersonation of Snake Plissken and considered the film's major supporting characters to be [...] "lifeless". Seitz described his discontent over the lack of innovation in the director's attempted homages of older films: [...] "Doomsday is frenetic, loud, wildly imprecise and so derivative that it doesn’t so much seem to reference its antecedents as try on their famous images <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> playing dress-up." ...|$|E

He {{died at the age of}} 48 from an overdose of morphine, while in Effingham, Illinois, in 1865, on circuit duty as a judge. [...] His wife died shortly after he did.

[...] The princess had short legs, which, paired with a long waist and arms, made her appear tall when sitting but short when standing. She was also quite plain. She suffered from significant health issues {{for the majority of}} her adult life; this was accompanied by a nearly continuous state of mental agitation and wild excitement, confusing her doctors. Her many health issues included rheumatism, joint pains, headaches and insomnia.|$|E
500|$|Between 26 April {{and early}} July 1999, Kouao visited Ealing social {{services}} 18 times for housing and financial purposes. Climbié {{was with her}} on at least ten occasions. The staff there noted Victoria's unkempt appearance, with one staff member, Deborah Gaunt, thinking that she looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> from an ActionAid advertisement. However, they did not take any action and may have assumed that Victoria's appearance was a purposeful attempt to [...] "persuade the authorities to hand out money". On 8 June 1999, Kouao {{got a job at}} Northwick Park Hospital. During her first month, no effort was made by Kouao or Ealing social services to enroll Climbié in educational or daycare activities.|$|E

500|$|Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline {{believed}} that Hergé's drawing became more assured throughout {{the first version}} of the story without losing any of its spontaneity. He thought that the story began in [...] "the most inoffensive way", and that throughout the story Tintin was portrayed as a Boy Scout, something he argued reflected Hergé's [...] "moral debt" [...] to Wallez. Biographer Benoît Peeters opined that Tintin in the Congo was [...] "nothing spectacular", with some [...] "incredibly cumbersome" [...] monologues, but he thought the illustrations [...] "a bit more polished" [...] than those in Land of the Soviets. Believing the plot to be [...] "extremely simple", he thought that Tintin's character was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> manipulating a world populated by toy animals and lead figurines.|$|E
500|$|Shaw {{was found}} by the Royal Navy helicopter, {{approximately}} 20 minutes after the alarm was raised, 150 metres downstream from where she had fallen in. Due to poor visibility {{as a result of}} heavy rain, the other members of her group had been unable to see her from where they were standing. There were two adults in the group. A member of the helicopter crew explained: [...] "There were two people waving their jackets and pointing into the river. Initially we thought 'Why are they not in the water helping?' what looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> face down in the water. Seeing the fast-flowing river, and how dangerous it would have been for them, there was no alternative for them to wait for us to arrive." ...|$|E
500|$|Harries {{commented that}} he [...] "was {{interested}} {{in developing a}} quality action series out of the UK because it's something we don't do very often, but there's no reason why we shouldn't." [...] Richard Armitage called the series an [...] "ambitious project for television. But the advantage {{of that is that}} these three feature films are linked together so you get a really interesting character arc through all episodes. American television is being brave and doing that at the moment, and this is stepping into that area." [...] Former SAS soldier and the original novel's author, Chris Ryan, served as the series consultant and script advisor. Chris Ryan stated; [...] "When you produce a novel it's <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> and to see it put onto screen opens it up to a greater audience. I class myself as a storyteller now, and to tell that story on paper is a great privilege, then to see it on screen is even better." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{hold that}} the {{darkness}} has over her does not disappear when she escapes and the Tombs are brought {{down in an}} earthquake by the nameless ones. She contemplates killing Ged, blaming him for her pain, but eventually learns to accept her guilt over her actions, realizing that though {{she had no choice}} in her actions as a priestess, she now has a choice to move away from them; but this [...] "freedom is a heavy load". Le Guin ends the novel with the reassuring sentence [...] "Gravely she walked beside [...] up the white streets of Havnor, holding his hand, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> coming home", suggesting that she has been successful in finding new connections in her life. The conclusion of the novel represents the successful end of a quest that Ged undertook as a mature wizard, part of the story arc that traces his character development across the first three Earthsea books; thus The Tombs of Atuan has been described as part of Ged's coming-of-age as well.|$|E
500|$|Liz (Tina Fey), Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) all {{attempt to}} trick Tracy into {{arriving}} at a rehearsal on time. [...] Tracy arrives not knowing {{what time it is}} and announces that Liz is racist and treating him <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> Liz challenges Tracy to behave better so he can be treated as an adult, but he responds by sending a gibbon to replace himself at rehearsal. Liz tells Tracy to arrive on time with his lines memorized the next day if he wants to be treated equally. Tracy retaliates by acting professionally but convincing everyone to treat Liz equally too, by making her lift heavy water jugs, passing gas near her, and inviting her to a strip club along with the other writers. Liz in turn stops Tracy from going to the strip club, noting that because he is acting so professionally he has to write notes for the upcoming script. Liz is uncomfortable at the strip club and Tracy hates writing all night so they agree to return to the [...] "natural order" [...] of things with both receiving preferential treatment.|$|E
500|$|At Oberstdorf, Tschaikovsky {{was visited}} by Tatiana Melnik, née Botkin. Melnik was the niece of Serge Botkin, {{the head of}} the Russian refugee office in Berlin, and the {{daughter}} of the imperial family's personal physician, Dr. Eugene Botkin, who had been murdered by the communists alongside the Tsar's family in 1918. Tatiana Melnik had met Grand Duchess Anastasia as a child and had last spoken to her in February 1917. To Melnik, Tschaikovsky looked like Anastasia, even though [...] "the mouth has changed and coarsened noticeably, and because the face is so lean, her nose looks bigger than it was." [...] In a letter, Melnik wrote: [...] "Her attitude is childlike, and altogether she cannot be reckoned with as a responsible adult, but must be led and directed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> She has not only forgotten languages, but has in general lost the power of accurate narration... even the simplest stories she tells incoherently and incorrectly; they are really only words strung together in impossibly ungrammatical German... Her defect is obviously in her memory and eyesight." [...] Melnik declared that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia, and supposed that any inability on her part to remember events and her refusal to speak Russian was caused by her impaired physical and psychological state. Either inadvertently through a sincere desire to [...] "aid the patient's weak memory" [...] or as part of a deliberate charade, Melnik coached Tschaikovsky with details of life in the imperial family.|$|E
