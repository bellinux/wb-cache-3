25|$|Back in Britain, Collins met Austin John Marshall, {{whom she}} later married. She also {{proceeded}} with her singing career, appearing releasing on three compilations albums (A Jug of Punch, A Pinch of Salt and Rocket Along) in 1960 and an EP, Heroes in Love, in 1963 (now included with False True Lovers on the CD release). It was after that, {{in a series}} of influential albums, that she helped to introduce many innovations into the English folk revival. In 1964, she recorded the landmark jazz-folk fusion of Folk Roots, New Routes, with guitarist Davy Graham. 1967 saw the essentially southern English song collection, The Sweet Primeroses, on which she was accompanied for the first time by Dolly Collins's portative organ. 1968's The Power of the True <b>Love</b> <b>Knot</b> also featured Dolly's accompaniment. In 1969, there was another collaboration, this time with The Young Tradition (featuring Peter Bellamy, Heather Wood and Royston Wood) and Dolly Collins, The Holly Bears the Crown. However, the album was not released until 1995.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{frame was}} covered in blue velvet with silver and gold embroidery, antique <b>love</b> <b>knots,</b> and pearls. It also included a self-portrait medallion of Jean Fouquet. Fouquet is shown frontally, his gold image is engraved into the black enamel background and framed by his name. It is believed that he invented this technique. The original position of the diptych high above the tomb {{would have made it}} difficult to see the tiny medallion and since the pieces have since been separated, its exact position on the frame is unclear. The medallion was Fouquet's way of signing the diptych. It is traditionally recognized as the oldest self-signed self-portrait and is Fouquet's only signed work.|$|R
25|$|Loop My Loop is a {{back-lit}} cibachrome {{photograph of}} blond hair intertwined with a pig's intestines. The golden locks signify purity and <b>love</b> <b>knotted</b> with the intestines, which signifies the raw animalistic side to human nature. This work has links {{with the ideas of}} Georges Bataille, a French intellectual and literary figure who worked in fields such as anthropology, sociology, and history of art. Chadwick's Loop My Loop is similar to her work from 1990, titled Nostalgie de la Boue. In this work, two rounded cibachrome transparencies were hung one above the other. The top one contained a ring of earthworms, while the bottom pictured someone's scalp with the center imploding. Both images appear similar, but by placing the worms above the human scalp the distinction upholding the human above the animal is no longer held.|$|R

50|$|Ghede Linto is a loa that {{performs}} miracles, {{although many}} think he's {{a small boy}} because of his politeness. About 5 feet tall, Linto is an old, dark-skinned man with a cane, glasses, and an old-fashioned black hat. He's very well mannered and docile. He loves to teach his worshipers to sing, and enjoys leaving them gifts he makes out of rum, Florida Water, a cigarette and fire. He cuts a piece of thread for each of his servants, or children from his house, and drops the threads in his special mix to produce needles for everyone; other times, gifts like gold rings or gold chains are given. He <b>loves</b> to make <b>knots</b> out of their scarves just to surprise them with gifts. Linto does these miracles to ensure his children they are in good hands. His work is very proficient, direct, and accurate; he can smell trouble six months away and either assists you to prepare for it or teaches you ways to prevent it.|$|R
60|$|The one who led {{was a man}} between fifty {{and sixty}} years of age, war-worn and weather-beaten, with a broad, {{thoughtful}} forehead and eyes which shone brightly from under his fierce and overhung brows. His beard, streaked thickly with gray, bristled forward from his chin, and spoke of a passionate nature, while the long, finely cut face and firm mouth marked the leader of men. His figure was erect and soldierly, and he rode his horse with the careless grace of a man whose life had been spent in the saddle. In common garb, his masterful face and flashing eye would have marked him as one who was born to rule; but now, with his silken tunic powdered with golden fleurs-de-lis, his velvet mantle lined with the royal minever, and the lions of England stamped in silver upon his harness, none could fail to recognize the noble Edward, most warlike and powerful of all {{the long line of}} fighting monarchs who had ruled the Anglo-Norman race. Alleyne doffed hat and bowed head at the sight of him, but the serf folded his hands and leaned them upon his cudgel, looking with little <b>love</b> at the <b>knot</b> of nobles and knights-in-waiting who rode behind the king.|$|R
50|$|He acted {{much with}} Charles Mathews, and {{was with him}} and Madame Vestris at the Lyceum from 1847 to 1855. This was {{the best part of}} his career. In October 1855 he played, at Drury Lane, Rob Royland to the Mopus of Charles Mathews, in Married for Money, an {{adaptation}} of John Poole's The Wealthy Widow. In March 1858 he was the original Lord George Lavender in Joseph Stirling Coyne's The <b>Love</b> <b>Knot.</b> He played, in March 1860, an original part in Edward Fitzball's Christmas Eve, or the Duel in the Snow, and in November 1861 was the original Hardess Cregan in H. J. Byron's burlesque Miss Eily O'Connor.|$|E

On 9 November he enacted at St James's Theatre the original Harrington in James Kenney's London Pride, or Living for Appearances.|$|E
5000|$|In 1960 he met {{the singer}} Shirley Collins when he was {{designing}} the cover for the compilation album Rocket Along, a collection of folk songs {{in which she was}} featured; they married the following year. Marshall continued to work at The Observer, and began taking an interest in traditional music. In 1964 he arranged for Collins to work with innovative guitarist Davy Graham on their joint album Folk Roots, New Routes, conceiving the album's approach and writing its liner notes. [...] He then worked as a record producer, art director and songwriter on Collins' albums The Sweet Primeroses (1967), The Power of the True <b>Love</b> <b>Knot</b> (1968), Anthems in Eden (1969), and Love, Death and the Lady (1970), on some of which Collins sang with her sister Dolly. He also wrote lyrics for the song [...] "Dancing At Whitsun", first published by Dallas and sung by Collins on Anthems In Eden and later covered by Tim Hart on the 1971 album Summer Solstice.|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} {{jouissance}} {{and the sexual}} reality of the unconscious has been a key concern of mine from my initial years of practicing psychoanalysis in both its clinical and critical frameworks. For my PhD research, this work is significantly developed within the Freudian Field of Psychoanalysis and the Lacanian Orientation and explores, as a starting point, a broad body of literature, historical and contemporary, concerning sexual identity, jouissance and the sexual reality of the unconscious. The literature review highlights that despite considerations given to overcoming dichotomies in sexual difference there are issues unveiled in late Lacanian teaching that remain only partially addressed. Within the mainstream of Lacanian psychoanalysis, the concepts of jouissance and the sexual reality of the unconscious are generally {{explained in terms of}} the possible rapport between the subject and the concepts of the phallus, the name-of-the-father and the symptom. In contradistinction, the quilting point around everything else is organized as the phenomenon of jouissance. Regarding jouissance, sexual difference is addressed, following Lacan’s formula of sexuation, by a theory based on the difference between the all-phallic jouissance, {{on the side of the}} Man, and the not-all-phallic jouissance, on the side of the Woman. This PhD research particularly engages the different types of jouissance discussed by Lacan, specifically jouissance other than phallic jouissance, and their effects in the subject, as perceived in our clinical practice, mediated by language and by lalangue. Further to that, this research closely engages the late Lacanian thesis of the two unconscious. One reference is to the imaginary or transference-unconscious, the one that is deciphered in analysis and that implies fantasy and desire as supports of the subject’s being, the unconscious related to language and the drives. Then there is the real unconscious, linked to Lacan’s neologisms as speaking-being and lalangue. Since the unconscious has been defined as being a reality which is sexual, the two unconscious allow for a different approach to the question of the difference of the sexes. The description of the sexes in terms of symbolic constructs, as in gender studies, is clearly and paradoxically anchored in the transference-unconscious, which is in the imaginary power of language to distinguish between the anatomical sexes. Moving from Lacan’s formula “There is no sexual relationship” this work discusses Lacan’s formula, “Jouissance is not a sign of love,” emphasizing from clinical work that jouissance and <b>love</b> get <b>knotted.</b> This leads to a reflection on the thesis of Partner-Symptom and Partner-Sinthome. Given that there is no sexual relationship, the symptom or the sinthome could achieve a possible union between the discrete elements of the unconscious and jouissance. Therefore symptoms/sinthomes are placed as a substitute and become no longer the problem but the solution. The research concludes with the concept of love. Lacan underlined that an aim of psychoanalytic discourse was to produce the passage from semblance to the real, from love to jouissance. Psychoanalysis erases, then, the difference between transference and normal love, the “There is no sexual relation” assumes the status of the Real. For speaking-beings love serves as a crutch of the sexual relation. Consequently, Lacan’s central determination of the relation between love and sexuality states that love supplements the sexual relation. Regarding the relation between the real unconscious and the transference-unconscious, this research refers to the equivocal title of Lacan’s Seminar XXIV, L’insu que sait de l’unebévue s’aile à mourre, which could be read as L’insuccès de l’Unbewusste, c’est l’amour—the non-success of the unconscious is love—engaging with the question: which unconscious and which love? And, indeed, this PhD research sheds some light on how jouissance establishes the sexual reality of the (two) unconscious...|$|R
