40|$|Pests {{may affect}} bean production, {{before and after}} harvest. Those that attack bean {{seedlings}} are the seed corn maggot which causes poor germination and deformed seedlings. The most common genera of cutworms include Agrotis, Feltia, and Spodoptera; white grubs and crickets also attack the seedlings. Leaf-feeding insects: many species of chrysomelids attack beans. These are also the vectors of BRMV. Several species of Lepidoptera develop on beans, among them the bean leaftoller, the saltmarsh caterpillar, Hedylepta indicata, and leafminers. The Mexican bean beetle is a pest found in many countries. Piercing insects: leafhoppers {{are the most important}} pests. Different cultural practices can be used to reduce populations and damage. The planting of beans/maize in association reduces populations. Five species of Aleyrodidae (among them Bemisia tabaci a vector of BGMV and bean chlorotic mottle) live on beans, but they also have other host plants. Whiteflies, aphids, thrips, and stick bugs are other piercing insects. Pod- attacking insects: bean pod weevil whose chemical control is conducted 6 days after initiation of flowering; Lepidopterous pod borers include the corn earworm and tobacco budworm, Epinotia pod borer, the <b>lima</b> <b>bean</b> <b>pod</b> <b>borer,</b> and Maruca testulalis. Storage insects: the principal pests are Acanthoscelides obtectus and Zabrotes subfaciatus. Weevils can be controled by applying ashes, black pepper, inert dusts, vegetable oils or by chemical control. Snails and slugs are not insects but can be serious pests; Vaginulus plebeius is the most important species. Best control is obtained by cleaning weeds and plant debris; baits can also be used. Spider mites and tropical mites can develop resistance to pesticides. The principal pests in Latin America are presented in table form; color ilustrations of the insects and the type of crop damage are also provided. (CIAT...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lima</b> <b>bean</b> <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> (LBPB), Etiella zynckenella Trietschke, is major {{insect pest}} of soybean in Indonesia. Currently {{it was also}} {{reported}} attacking groundnut {{in some parts of}} Sumatera causing serious yield loss. Insecticide treatment is not only ecologically unsafe, but also is not practical due to concealed behavior of the larvae within pods below soil surface. Systemic insecticide might be so but unsafe as it might leave unaccepted residue in harvested pods. It is clear that safer more effective technology such as biological control is badly needed. A Field study was conducted at the University of Bengkulu Research Station in 2012 - 2013. The objectives was to determine the effectiveness of non  local strain of entomopathoegen nematode (EPN), Sterinenema carpocapsae, to control LBPB attacking groundnut. Groundnut seeds were sewed in plots which were later treated with S. carpocasae produce by Biological Control Laboratory University of Jember at the dose of 500. 000 JI m - 2. EPN was sprayed upon plants and soil surface twice at plant age of 45 and 65 days after sewing (DAS). There were insecticide treatment and control plots as comparison. Observations of damaged pods and the presence of LBPB larvae were done at plant age of 63, 77,  90 DAS and at the haevesting date. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and the means of damaged pods were separated with least significant different (LSD). The result revealed that in two years study,  damaged pods consistently tended to be less in plots treated with S. carpocasae or insecticide than those in controls, indicating that it might be effective against PLPB. The lack of significant different between EPN treated and control  plots might be as a result of low percentages of EPN larval survival due shipment problem (i. e. inappropriate packaging and long transportation that toke several days) or it might be that the strain was less adapted yet to local conditions. I speculate that local strain of EPN might be more effective to control LBPB attacking groundnut...|$|E

50|$|Since crambids are {{relatively}} common throughout human settlements, the moths tend to affect crops and gardens, whether harmfully, beneficially or harmlessly. Beneficial crambids include the water hyacinth moth (Niphograpta albiguttalis), {{used to control}} its host (Eichhornia crassipes), the water veneer (Acentria ephemerella), a biocontrol agent used against Eurasian watermilfoil), and the bamboo borer (Omphisa fuscidentalis), of which the caterpillars are used for human consumption (see entomophagy).

40|$|A {{series of}} half-diallel crosses {{involving}} early, medium and late maturity desi and kabuli type chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) genotypes with stable resistance to Helicoverpa <b>pod</b> <b>borer,</b> {{along with the}} parents, were evaluated at two locations in India to understand the inheritance of <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> resistance and grain yield. Inheritance of resistance to <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> and grain yield was different in desi and kabuli types. In desi type chickpea, the additive component of genetic variance was important in early maturity and dominance component was predominant in medium maturity group, while in the late maturity group, additive as well as dominance components were equally important in the inheritance of <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> resistance. Both dominant and recessive genes conferring <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> resistance seemed equally frequent in the desi type parental lines of medium maturity group. However, dominant genes were in overall excess in the parents of early and late maturity groups. In the kabuli medium maturity group, parents appeared to be genetically similar, possibly due to dispersion of genes conferring <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> resistance and susceptibility, while their F 1 s were significantly different for <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> damage. The association of genes conferring <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> resistance and susceptibility in the parents {{could be attributed to}} the similarity of parents as well as their F 1 s for <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> damage in kabuli early and late maturity groups. Grain yield was predominantly under the control of dominant gene action irrespective of the maturity groups in desi chickpea. In all the maturity groups, dominant and recessive genes were in equal frequency among the desi parental lines. Dominant genes, which tend to increase or decrease grain yield are more or less present in equal frequency in parents of the early maturity group, while in medium and late maturity groups, they were comparatively in unequal frequency in desi type. Unlike in desi chickpea, differential patterns of genetic components were observed in kabuli chickpea. While the dominant genetic component was important in early and late maturity group, additive gene action was involved in the inheritance of grain yield in medium duration group in kabuli chickpea. The dominant and recessive genes controlling grain yield are asymmetrically distributed in early and medium maturity groups in kabuli chickpea. The implications of the inheritance pattern of <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> resistance and grain yield are discussed in the context of strategies to enhance <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> resistance and grain yield in desi and kabuli chickpea cultivars...|$|R

Researchers from the University of Agricultural Sciences have been studying birds that fed on <b>pod</b> <b>borers</b> of field <b>beans.</b> Five species of birds were found to be important: the house crow, the house sparrow, the golden oriole, the black drongo and the mynah. At one time of year these birds were seen to eat as many as five to eight larvae per minute. Over the whole season the house crows, which were present at a population of about 200 per sq km, each accounted for four larvae per minute. <b>Pod</b> <b>borers</b> were not the only insects eaten. Analyses of the birds' crops showed that their diet consisted of about one-third <b>pod</b> <b>borers,</b> and about twice that for other insects, but whether some of these are beneficial has still to be verified. Some plant material was eaten by one species, the house sparrow, but it was far less than would have been damaged by the <b>pod</b> <b>borers.</b> At the site, with the highest bird population, crop losses resulting from <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> were 22 %, compared to 61 % where bird numbers only 50 per sq km.

Unfortunately, the same defensive system makes chickpeas inhospitable plants for beneficial insects' posing problems for an effective biological control strategy. However, researchers at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) have devised an effective integrated pest management (IPM) programme.

Their attack on all plant population was in range between 0. 01 and 0. 23 %, while in produced plant population was in range between 0. 20 and 3. 06 %. The control could be apply are early pick up the pods, used the resistant clones for juvenilization, and spraying by synthetic...|$|R
40|$|The major pest {{problems}} in chickpea, i. e. <b>pod</b> <b>borers</b> (Helicoverpa armigera and H. punctigera), leafminer Liriomyza cicerina, black cutworm Agrotis ipsilon, aphids (Aphis craccivora), semilooper Autographa nigrisigna and bruchids (Callosobruchus spp.), and their management options (cultural, {{biological and chemical}} controls) are discussed. Low to moderate levels of resistance {{have been identified in}} the germplasm, and a few improved cultivars with resistance to <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> and high grain yield have been developed. Germplasm accessions of the wild relatives of chickpea (Cicer bijugum, C. judaicum and C. reticulatum) can be used to increase the levels and diversify the bases of resistance to H. armigera. Efforts are also underway to utilize molecular techniques to increase the levels of resistance to <b>pod</b> <b>borer.</b> Synthetic insecticides, agronomic practices, nuclear polyhedrosis virus, entomopathogenic fungi, bacteria and natural plant products have been evaluated as components of pest management in chickpea...|$|R

50|$|<b>Lima</b> <b>bean</b> agar (LBA) {{is a kind}} of agar medium {{which is}} used to {{cultivate}} the spore of Phytophthora sojae. Phytophthora sojae causes soybean blight (Phytophthora root rot of soybeans). Soybean blight can affect the output and quality of soybeans seriously. The spore of phytophthora sojae is difficult to culture in potato dextrose agar; it is generally cultured by <b>lima</b> <b>bean</b> agar and carrot agar. <b>Lima</b> <b>bean</b> agar can cultivate, separate, reproduce and conserve many kinds spore of phytophthora sojae, but it is not suitable for cultivating the pathogen of potato late blight.|$|R
40|$|Pigeonpea lines {{which have}} shown {{tolerance}} to <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> and <b>pod</b> fly damage at ICRISAT, Patancheru, India, {{were tested in}} the field at Kabete and Kiboko, Kenya, and compared with five local checks. There were sprayed and unsprayed plots for each line. Endosulfan 35 E. C. was applied at 0. 07 % active ingredient (a. i.) starting at flower bud expansion stage, at 50 % flowering, early podding, and full podding stages. At crop maturity, all pods from three plants plot- 1 were sampled and seed damage by different insect pests determined. The results showed that seeds from all lines were damaged by <b>pod</b> <b>borers</b> and <b>pod</b> sucking bugs. Pod fly incidence was greater at Kabete than at Kiboko, and damage was lower on test lines than on checks. Spraying reduced seed damage from 57. 6 % to 9. 3 % and from 59. 9 % to 4. 5 % on <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> lines and <b>pod</b> fly lines, respectively, at Kiboko, and from 19. 9 % to 5. 4 % on pod fly lines at Kabete. At Kiboko seed damage in unsprayed <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> (57. 6 %) and pod fly (59. 9 %) lines was similar. Seed damage on pod fly lines at Kiboko (59. 9 %) {{was significantly higher than}} at Kabete (19. 9 %). Positive significant correlations were observed between seed mass and pod fly damage at Kabete (r = 0. 31 *) and Kiboko (r = 0. 30 *). The results indicated that although some lines showed tolerance to <b>pod</b> <b>borer</b> and <b>pod</b> fly damage, they were highly susceptible to pod sucking bugs, suggesting that such tolerance does not hold against other insect groups...|$|R
40|$|Global {{warming and}} climate change will {{influence}} activity, diversity, distribution and population dynamics of insect pests including the grain legumes. Several insect pests damage grain legume crops, of which the <b>pod</b> <b>borer,</b> Helicoverpa armigera; spotted <b>pod</b> <b>borer,</b> Maruca vitrata; spiny <b>pod</b> <b>borer,</b> Etiella zinckenella; <b>pod</b> fly, Melanagromyza obtusa; aphid, Aphis craccivora; defoliators, Spodoptera litura and S. exigua; thrips, Megaleurothrips usitatus and Caliothrips indicus and the bruchid, Callasobruchus chinensis cause extensive losses in grain legumes. The incidence and extent of losses due to these pests varies across seasons, locations, and cropping systems.  The pest spectrum on grain legumes will change considerably due to impending global warming {{and climate change}}. The geographical distribution {{of some of the}} pests might extend to temperate regions in Europe and America, while the outbreaks of some other pests will become more frequent. Several outbreaks of <b>pod</b> <b>borer,</b> H. armigera and spotted <b>pod</b> <b>borer,</b> M. vitrata have been recorded on grain legumes in India, which at times have resulted in complete crop loss. The scale insect, Ceroplastodes cajani in pigeonpea and beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua, mealy bug, Ferrisia virgata, and white fly, Bemisia tabaci in chickpea have emerged as new pests; while leaf miner, Porphyrosela neodoxa, mealy bugs, Drepanococcus cajani, and Coccidohystrix insolita are some of the emerging pest problems in pigeonpea in India. In addition, there will be greater genotype x environment interactions for expression of resistance to insect pests, and this warrants a greater effort for identification of diverse sources of resistance and need for integrated pest management packages that will be effective under global warming and climate change...|$|R
