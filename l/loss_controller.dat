40|$|Abstract. In {{control design}} for {{bilateral}} telemanipulation {{there is a}} trade-off between high transparency and sufficient stability margins. Stability problems can occur when the stiff slave manipulator encounters a stiff environment and large contact forces are fed back to the badly damped master giving oscillative behaviour in the teleoperator.

Adaptive control methods which adds extra damping in the teleoperator control loop when it is needed is a promising concept. This paper presents an idea on how to detect when to engage such an adaptive controller. The idea is based on the fundamental passivity result where passivity is regarded as a phase property and experimental results which show that during certain stiff contacts and oscillative behaviour, the teleoperator controller has a slightly positive net energy as a result of power gain on the master port and power <b>loss</b> on the <b>controller’s</b> slave port.

Each servo-axis comprises a servo-motor, a mechanical transmission and an end-effector, and is responsible for generating the desired motion profile and providing the power required to achieve the overall task. The design of a such a machine must involve a detailed study from a mechatronic viewpoint, due to its electric and mechanical nature. The first objective of this thesis is the development of an overarching electromechanical model for a servo-axis. Every loss source is taken into account, be it mechanical or electrical. The mechanical transmission is modeled by means of a sequence of lumped-parameter blocks. The electric model of the motor and the inverter takes into account winding losses, iron <b>losses</b> and <b>controller</b> switching <b>losses.</b> No experimental characterizations are needed to implement the electric model, since the parameters are inferred from the data available in commercial catalogs. With the global model at disposal, a second objective of this work is to perform the optimization analysis, in particular, the selection of the motor-reducer unit.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{improving}} and measuring {{the efficiency of}} variable speed induction motor drives. Optimized efficiency is achieved by adapting the magnetizing level in the motor according to the load percentage. The thesis investigates on the efficiency improvement of squirrel cage induction motors fed by SVM-VSI, by using the loss model method. A new expression for the optimal air gap flux is calculated from a detailed loss model. This loss model comprises the copper loss, iron loss, friction, windage, stray, and harmonic loss. The calculated optimal air gap flux {{is a function of}} these losses and also considers the non-linearity of the magnetizing inductance and the effect of the temperature on the motor parameters (stator and rotor resistances). The proposed loss model improves the efficiency of a speed sensorless indirect field oriented control (IFOC) induction motor. The (IFOC) of an induction motor is sensitive to motor parameter variation. Rotor and stator resistances vary with the motor temperature, and the proposed <b>loss</b> model <b>controller</b> depends on the motor parameters. So an on-line estimation of motor parameters using parameter adaptive observer is used. An on-line search control method shows the accuracy of the optimal flux values, which are calculated by using the proposed loss model. By using the calculated optimal air gap flux for speed sensorless indirect vector controlled induction motor, an improvement in motor efficiency and power factor are achieved especially at light load. If there is an increase in the load while the motor is operating with the optimal flux value, the flux will be right away increased to the rated value, and later, the suitable optimal flux value according to the new load torque is calculated. Measuring the efficiency of the induction motor according to IEEE- 112 B standard requires highly accurate measuring devices, where the inaccuracy of the power meter and torque meter should not exceed (0. 1 %), and (1 RPM) for speed sensor. But such devices are expensive. An accurate system using a FPGA was designed to calculate the motor efficiency without requiring a power meter. By adapting the motor voltages and currents signals, load torque meter signal, and position sensor signal the average electrical and mechanical motor powers are calculated in a FPGA. The accuracy of the calculated electrical power is verified by using advanced power meter (with accuracy equals 0. 1 %), in order to satisfy the recommendation of the standard IEEE- 112 B. Fuzzy Logic Controller improves the motor speed performance when compare to PI speed controller. The improvement in the efficiency, the power factor and the motor stability under fast load variations by using the proposed optimal flux control method is compared with the rated flux control method experimentally.

40|$|As {{the motor}} consumes more than 50 % of total {{electrical}} energy {{produced in the}} world, the efficiency optimization of the motor is a burning issue in terms of saving energy and the environment. In modern days researchers display immense interest in the control of a high performing interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSM) drive for general industrial applications. The IPMSM is largely used in low and medium power applications such as adjustable speed drives, robotics, aerospace and electric vehicles due to its several advantageous features such as high power density, greater flux weakening capability, high output torque, high power factor, low noise, robustness and high efficiency {{as compared to the}} dc motors and induction motors (IM). Nevertheless, its high efficiency characteristics are influenced by applied control strategies. Most of the reported works developed control algorithms for IPMSM to achieve high performance. However, the efficiency optimization of IPMSM, {{which is one of the}} important aspects is often ignored. Therefore, in this thesis the efficiency optimization issues is also considered along with high performance control. This thesis presents a nonlinear <b>loss</b> model-based <b>controller</b> (LMC) for IPMSM drive to achieve both high efficiency and high performance of the drive. Among numerous loss minimization algorithms (LMA), a LMC approach offers a fast response without torque pulsations. However, it requires the accurate loss model and the knowledge of the motor parameters. Therefore, a difficulty in deriving the LMC lies in the complexity of the full loss model. Moreover, the conventional LMC does not pay attention to the performance of the drive at all. In an effort to overcome the drawbacks of conventional LMC, an adaptive backstepping based nonlinear control (ABNC) is designed to achieve high dynamic performance speed control for an IPMSM drive is developed in this thesis. The system parameter variations as well as field control are taken into account at the design stage of the controller. Thus, the proposed ABNC is capable of maintaining the system robustness and stability against mechanical parameter variation and external load torque disturbance. To ensure stability the controller is designed based on Lyapunov?s stability theory while the LMC ensures high efficiency of the drive. A neuro-fuzzy logic controller (NFC) including LMC is also developed in this work. The proposed NFC overcomes the unknown and nonlinear uncertainties of the drive, the membership function of the controller is tuned online. An important part of this work is directed to develop an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) based NFC. In this work, an adaptive tuning algorithm is also developed to adjust the membership function and consequent parameters. The complete closed-loop system model is developed and then simulated using MATLAB/Simulink software. Performance of the various control algorithms based IPMSM drive is investigated extensively at different dynamic operating conditions such as sudden load change, command speed change, parameter variation, etc. The performance of the proposed loss minimization based ABNC and NFC are also compared with the conventional id= 0 control scheme. The complete IPMSM drive have been successfully implemented in real-time using digital signal processor (DSP) controller board DS 1104 for a laboratory 5 hp motor. The experimental results verify the simulation of NFC based loss minimization. It is found from the results that proposed drive algorithms can improve the efficiency by around 3 % as compared to without any LMA...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{resistive}} losses incurred in returning a power network to a synchronous state following a transient stability event, or in maintaining this {{state in the}} presence of persistent stochastic disturbances. We quantify these transient power losses, the so-called “Price of Synchrony”, using the squared H 2 norm of a linear system of generator and load dynamics subject to distributed disturbances. We first consider a large network of synchronous generators and use the classical machine model to form a system with coupled second order swing equations. We then extend this model to explicitly include dynamics of loads and asynchronous generators, which represent solar and wind power plants. These elements are modeled as frequency-dependent power injections (extractions), and the resulting system is one of coupled firstand second order dynamics. In both cases, the disturbance inputs represent power fluctuations due to transient stability events or the inherent variability of loads and intermittent energy sources. The network structure is captured through a weighted graph Laplacian of the network admittance. In order to simplify the analysis for both models, we use the concept of grounded graph Laplacians to obtain an asymptotically stable reduced system. We then evaluate the transient losses in the reduced system and show that this system’s H 2 norm is in fact equivalent to the H 2 norm of the original system. Furthermore we show that although the transient behaviours of the first order, second order or mixed dynamical systems are in general fundamentally different, for same-sized networks they may all have the same H 2 norm if the damping coefficients are uniform. The H 2 norms for both system models are shown to be a function of transmission line and generator properties and to scale with the network size. These transient losses do not, however, depend on the network connectivity. This is in contrast to related power system stability notions that predict better synchronous stability properties for highly connected networks. The equivalence of the norms for different order systems indicate that renewable energy sources will not increase transient power <b>losses</b> if their <b>controllers</b> can be adjusted to match the dampings of existing synchronous generators. However, since the losses scale linearly with the number of generators, our results also demonstrate that increased amounts of distributed generation in low-voltage grids will lead to larger transient losses, and that this effect cannot be alleviated by increasing the network connectivity...|$|R

Moreover, we introduce an adaptive mechanism to minimize the energy consumption while fulfilling reliability and delay constraints. Second, we extend the analysis to multi-hop networks, including heterogeneous traffic distribution and limited carrier sensing range. Due to the contention-based channel access, routing decisions based on reliability or delay typically direct traffic toward nodes with high packet generation rates, leading to unbalanced performance and higher energy consumption. A load balancing metric is proposed for the IETF routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks. Furthermore, a mechanism to optimally select routes and MAC parameters is implemented. Third, we include a realistic channel model in the analysis. Multi-path and shadowing are modeled by a Nakagami-lognormal distribution. A moment matching approximation is used to derive the statistics of aggregate signals. The impact of fading on MAC and routing is determined for various traffic regimes, distances among devices, and signal-to-(interference plus noise) -ratio settings. The results show that a certain level of fading actually improves the network performance. Fourth, we propose TREnD, a cross-layer protocol that takes into account tunable application requirements. Duty cycling, data aggregation, and power control are employed to provide energy efficiency and an optimization problem is solved to select the protocol parameters adaptively. TREnD is implemented on a test-bed and it is compared to existing protocols. Experimental results show load balancing and adaptation for static and dynamic scenarios. Finally, the analytical models developed in the thesis are formalized into a contract-based design framework. We consider a building automation example with a feedback control system over a heterogeneous network. We include the effects of delays and <b>losses</b> in the <b>controller</b> synthesis and we compare various robust control strategies. The use of contracts allows for a compositional design that handles performance, heterogeneity, and reconfigurability in a systematic and efficient way. QC 20121212 </p...|$|R
