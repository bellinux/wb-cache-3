40|$|Faced with fast {{changing}} environment, livestock epidemics and EU accession, {{risk management}} {{is of utmost}} importance for Croatian farmers. Insurance is risk management strategy which enables risk transfer from farmer to insurance company. It has {{a positive effect on}} income stabilization and consequently could lead to higher level of specialization, credit access and competitiveness. Nevertheless, <b>livestock</b> <b>insurance</b> is relatively unimportant on dairy farms. Reasons are twofold. Uncompleted requirements for risk to be insurable, adverse selection and moral hazard problems reflect on untoward premium rates. Demand for insurance, on the other hand, depends on the farm structure, access to other risk management instruments as well as dairy farmer’s management capacities. The objective of the paper is to analyze risk management on dairy farms with focus on <b>livestock</b> <b>insurance.</b> Survey on 20 farmers in the Northwest Croatia has been made.

30|$|In 2010 / 11, an {{innovative}} index-based <b>livestock</b> <b>insurance</b> (IBLI) {{was introduced in}} Northern Kenya through the joint effort of the International Livestock Research Center (ILRI), Cornell University in USA, a private insurance company in Ethiopia and Swiss Re. Initial results from this initiative indicate that high premium, basis risk and risk preferences have strong effects on the uptake of insurance, similar to earlier findings (Mude and Barrett 2012). Using the NDVI index for vegetative cover on rangeland, Chantarat et al. (2012) found that risk preference, perceived basis risk and the subjective expectation of loss were important factors affecting Northern Kenyan pastoralists’ willingness to pay for index-based <b>livestock</b> <b>insurance.</b> Besides index-based <b>livestock</b> <b>insurance</b> pilots, index-based crop insurance schemes (Kilimo Salama, meaning safe farming) are being tested. In {{an effort to reduce}} delivery costs, mobile phones are in use to pay premiums, receive payouts and weather information (see Syngenta 2012). The delivery mechanism is based on linking insurance with input marketing. When farmers buy seeds, fertilizer or other agricultural inputs, they can also buy insurance for their inputs by paying 5  % of the input cost. Covered farmers need to register in one of the weather stations close to their farm.|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsKevin C. DhuyvetterRisk is an {{inevitable}} part of production agriculture. Price risk is especially {{a concern for}} cattle producers in the Midwest. Producers can curtail profit volatility, to an extent, through the utilization of price risk management strategies such as forward contracting, hedging, using put and call options, <b>Livestock</b> Risk Protection <b>Insurance</b> (LRP), as well as <b>Livestock</b> Gross <b>Insurance</b> (LGM) for feedlot cattle. Learning about such price risk management tools can be a daunting task. Kansas State University Extension created a computer based simulation workshop {{to assist them in}} teaching cattle producers about price risk management strategies. The simulation paralleled a lecture where participants learned of the price risk management strategies that are available. The simulation allowed the workshop participants to practice using the management strategies as they assumed the role of a feedlot or ranch manager in charge of marketing the operation's calves. In a cooperative effort with Iowa State University, Kansas State University presented the Cattle Risk Management Workshops across the state of Iowa. Participants were given pre-and posttests to measure the effectiveness of the workshop. The overall post-test scores were 25 percentage points higher than the pre-test scores. This research also discusses the interest and perceptions of cattle producers regarding price risk management strategies. The effectiveness of simulations as a teaching tool in helping producers learn about price risk management strategies is also reviewed. In addition, the various price risk management strategies available to producers, as well as seasonality of prices and basis are analyzed.
