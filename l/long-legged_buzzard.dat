2500|$|Other {{than these}} two species, {{a large share}} of the {{raptorial}} prey for eagle-owls is made up of other owls. Given that all European owls are to some extent nocturnal, they may be encountered and killed upon detection by the Eurasian eagle-owl. In Europe, it has killed every other species of owl, from the tiny pygmy owl and scops owl to the large [...] great grey owl and the [...] snowy owl. The Eurasian eagle-owl is the only raptor that has been known to prey on snowy owl on [...] multiple occasions. However, the threat Eurasian eagle-owls poses to other raptors can be exaggerated. Occasionally, with adequate mammal prey populations, they can nest as close as a few dozen meters of other raptors and never harass them. When nesting in the same groves as the [...] <b>long-legged</b> <b>buzzards</b> (Buteo rufinus) in southeastern Bulgaria, Eurasian eagle-owls did not predate the buzzards at any point. <b>Long-legged</b> <b>buzzards</b> have been killed however in Kazakhstan. Even in those occasional cases where they pick off one or several raptors, they do not effect the overall population, unless the raptorial prey is already heavily diminished due to some other (often human-based) cause. For example, despite both being a known predator both, they did not significantly depress numbers of either northern goshawks or tawny owls in southern Finland. One study showed that many raptors engage in spatial avoidance during potential encounters with Eurasian eagle-owls and while the predation by eagle-owls did decrease raptor population densities, they seldom caused declines in breeding success or altered habitat occupancy.|$|R
40|$|Summary: In this study, {{wild birds}} died at Kayseri Beştepeler Zoo then {{presented}} for necropsy to Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at Erciyes University were investigated for pathological, bacteriological and mycological aspects from October 2004 to March 2005. Of 12 wild birds four were pigeons (Columba domestica), three were <b>long-legged</b> <b>buzzards</b> (Buteo rufinus), two were mandarin ducks (Aix galericulato), two were turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo), {{and one was}} pheasant (Phasianus colchicus). On postmortem examinations, tuberculosis lesions on the liver, lungs, spleen, and small intestine were observed. Histopathological examinations of lesions revealed granulomas with acid-fast bacilli within typical multinucleated giant cells of the granulomas. Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium was isolated and identified by bacteriological culture and BACTEC rapid radiometric technique, respectively. In conclusion, the incidence of avian tuberculosis is high among wild birds in Kayseri zoo...|$|R
50|$|The <b>long-legged</b> <b>buzzard</b> (Buteo rufinus) is a {{bird of prey}} in the Buteo genus. It {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the rough-legged buzzard (Buteo lagopus), but it is larger and more robust.|$|E
50|$|Larger herbivores are {{represented}} by goitered gazelles, low numbers of wild sheep (Ovis), and Carpathian boars (Sus scrofa attila). Rodents and hares are abundant. The main raptors are the <b>long-legged</b> <b>buzzard</b> (Buteo ruffinus) and the golden eagle (Aquila heliaca).|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} home to a number of species, such as common buzzard, <b>long-legged</b> <b>buzzard,</b> Eurasian sparrowhawk, lesser spotted eagle, common kingfisher, white-throated dipper, fieldfare, grey wagtail, corn bunting, hawfinch, European stonechat, common cuckoo, black stork, {{different}} species of falcons, woodpeckers, swallows, etc.|$|E
5000|$|This {{is one of}} {{the largest}} species of Buteo. Length can range from 50 to 66 cm and {{wingspan}} from 115 to 160 cm. Females, at an average mass of 1.3 kg, are larger than males, at an average of 1.1 kg. There are many different colour forms, but usually long-leggeds have a clear orange tint to the plumage, red or orange tail, pale head and largely white underwings. There is usually a distinctive black carpal patch and dark trailing edge to the wing. The rump and [...] "trousers" [...] are often dark or deep rufous. Plumage varies from ghostly pale individuals to very dark ones. Some plumages are almost similar to those of the steppe buzzard, the eastern subspecies of the common buzzard (Buteo buteo vulpinus), but <b>long-legged</b> <b>buzzards</b> have longer wings and are more like rough-legged buzzards or even a small Aquila eagle.|$|R

40|$|Nesting {{success and}} chick {{survival}} of a migratory population of Houbara Bustard Chlamy-dotis [undulata] macqueenii were studied during three consecutive years (1998 – 2000) in the Xinjiang province of north-west China. A total of 45 nests was monitored and 85 broods comprising 227 chicks were captured, of which 82 chicks were radio-tracked. Start of laying varied between 6 and 17 April between years but the laying mode fell consistently between 26 and 30 April. Mean clutch size was 4. 0 (sd = 0. 8) (range 2 – 6) for early clutches and 3. 3 (sd = 1. 1) for late clutches (range 2 – 5). The average nesting success was 0. 588 (sd = 0. 270) but great variations were observed between years – 0. 882 in 1998, 0. 530 in 1999 and 0. 351 in 2000. This {{was related to}} increased predation in 1999 and 2000, which is reflected by increased predator density (chiefly Corsac Fox Vulpes corsac and <b>Long-legged</b> <b>Buzzards</b> Buteo rufinus). The overall hatchability, defined as the proportion of eggs hatched in successful nests was 0. 839 sd = 0. 238). The average brood size at hatching varied from 2. 9 (sd = 0. 8) to 3. 3 (sd = 0. 9) according to years, and no significant decrease in brood size was observed in the first 5 days post-hatching.

25|$|Other raptors, {{large and}} small, are often {{outright}} dominated by golden eagles. In Eurasia, the relative paucity of mid-sized Buteo species {{is thought to}} be due to the radiation of large Aquila eagles that already occupied the large raptor niche and outcompeted them. In North America, where there are no Aquila eagles other than the golden eagle, Buteo species are more diverse with at least 3 large hawks (the red-tailed, Swainson's (Buteo swainsoni) and ferruginous hawks (Buteo regalis)) that occur in similar habitats and sometimes eat similar prey as both each other and golden eagles. On occasion, golden eagles will kleptoparasitize or even predate these three Buteos. Other small to medium-sized diurnal raptors are known to occasionally be hunted by golden eagles, including ospreys (Pandion haliaetus), black kite (Milvus migrans), hen harriers (Circus cyaneus), Eurasian sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus), Cooper's hawks (Accipter cooperii), northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis), red-shouldered hawks (Buteo lineatus), common <b>buzzards</b> (Buteo buteo), <b>long-legged</b> <b>buzzards</b> (Buteo rufinus), upland buzzards (Buteo hemilasius), rough-legged buzzards, Eurasian kestrels (Falco tinnunculus), American kestrels (Falco sparverius), merlins (Falco columbarius), prairie falcons and gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus). Occasionally, golden eagles may even boldly predate these smaller species during migration in mid-flight, as was recorded at Hawk Mountain Sanctuary with a red-shouldered hawk. It is thought that on rare occasions, more nimble, smaller raptors like rough-legged buzzards and harriers can kleptoparatisize golden eagles. Interestingly, northern goshawks in Scandinavia rely on grouse to about the same extent as golden eagles there and even hunt in similar forest edge habitats there. However, the goshawks primarily hunt neonatal and fledgling grouse (30% and 53% of their take of grouse) rather than adult grouse (17% of their prey) in late summer when grouse dominate other birds in their diet, whereas the eagles seem to mainly adult grouse and hunt them aseasonally. Similarly, hen harriers may become somewhat specialized at taking young red grouse, whereas the eagles are more likely to take adults.|$|R

40|$|Dadia-Lefkimi-Soufli National Park forms {{part of the}} Natura 2000 {{network in}} a region of Greece and {{represents}} one of the most diverse landscapes for raptors (birds of prey) breeding in Europe. It is adjacent to Bulgaria and Turkey and is a renowned biodiversity hotspot. WWF Greece established a Systematic Raptor Monitoring scheme in this area in 2001. This study summarises the results of the first 12 years of monitoring in the National Park. Overall, 25 to 27 raptor species were recorded by pooling data, of which 20 species reproduced in the National Park. Raptors with continuous presence in the National Park exhibited stable, species-specific inter-annual variation. An average of 348 ± 15. 4 raptor territories were distributed throughout the National Park for all species. The Common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and the Short-toed eagle (Circaetus gallicus) were the most common species year-round, followed by the Lesser-spotted eagle (Clanga pomarina) and Booted eagle (Aquila pennata). The <b>Long-legged</b> <b>buzzard</b> (Buteo rufinus), Honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus) and Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) exhibited a noticeable drop in population numbers over the study period. A significant new entry was the re-appearance of the White-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), which was recorded breeding again in the region after a 21 -year absence. Species trends, along with their ecological traits, are discussed with respect to landscape changes in Dadia NP and minimum viable population and territory thresholds are proposed to outline essential conservation issues. Although a multi-year balance {{of the total number of}} occupied territories for all species was recorded, the number of common species increased compared to specialist species which had smaller, declining populations. The abandoning of traditional livestock farming, which induces an increase in closed-canopy forest coverage, might have led to the decline of the Lesser-spotted eagle, <b>Long-legged</b> <b>buzzard</b> and Honey buzzard numbers. Additional pressure is added from specialist forest dwelling raptors which are favoured by this change in habitat. The results of this study are expected to provide useful insights to facilitate conservation and management decisions about raptors and their habitat in this region...|$|E
