30|$|In {{this paper}} the {{proposed}} design approach is aimed to consider any imperfection {{on the original}} column {{as well as the}} acting end moments when designing the column. That can be done be transforming the original column considering any initial bending moments to an equivalent pin-ended axially loaded column. And then, the additional bending moment including the end eccentricities as well as slenderness effect can be calculated. Therefore, the <b>lower</b> <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratio</b> could be bypassed. In addition, in order to verify the instability failure of the column, the acting axial load on the equivalent column is compared with the critical buckling load of the column.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to build upon {{previous}} post buckling research by including the effects of material degradation on column strength due to temperature increase. Failure of a structure during a fire occurs in most part because of material degradation. As the temperature increases the stiffness and strength of a structural material decreases and ultimately results in failure. 	In this study, columns with three different types of end restraints were studied. These are: Pinned-Pinned Columns, Pinned-Fixed Columns, Fixed-Fixed Columns. For each end-restraint type three different <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratios</b> were considered: λ= 50, λ= 125, and λ= 200. After the data was reviewed, some conclusions that can be made are 	Axially restricted columns with <b>lower</b> <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratios</b> are more affected by material degradation. This is because columns with <b>lower</b> <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratios</b> have a higher Tcr allowing the effects of material degradation to begin affecting the columns strength at much lower T/Tcr ratios, in some cases before the ratio even reaches 1. Axially restricted columns with a higher number of rotational end-restraints are more affected by material degradation. This can also be attributed to a higher Tcr that allows the effects of material degradation to begin affecting the columns strength at much lower T/Tcr ratios...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{processing}} and manufacturing mills, workshops, warehouses, bridges and other industrial buildings belong to industrial heritage. Their origin {{dates back to}} the 19 th and 20 th century when cast iron became a widely used construction material. It has been recognised that existing structures including cast-iron structures do not fulfil requirements of present codes of practice. A key step of reliability assessment is modelling of resistance of load-bearing members made of cast iron. The present paper investigates several empirical or physical models for resistance of historic cast-iron columns. Outcomes of the models are critically compared with experimental results obtained for solid and hollow cylindrical, and square columns from English grey cast iron. Imprecision of the models is expressed by means of model uncertainty for which appropriate probabilistic models are proposed. As tensile strength of cast iron is considerably lower than compressive strength, it dominates resistances of columns centrically loaded in compression with <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratio</b> over 60. In such cases model uncertainty can be described by a two-parameter lognormal distribution with the mean of 1. 25 and coefficient of variation of 0. 15.

40|$|Storm {{damage is}} {{becoming}} recognised {{as a significant}} problem in the Ovens Zone as the plantation area expands, because stands with about 1600 stems/ha on high-quality sites (>SI 27) become increasingly prone to "collapse" once the stand height exceeds 20 m. Commercial thinning before the stands become unstable is not feasible because yields are quite low (60 - 75 m 3 /ha) and piece size is small (0. 05 - 0. 08 m 3). Harvesting systems for such areas need to be specially designed to operate economically at these levels. Systems are also needed to handle smashed and tangled material until new silviculture aimed at providing more stable stands becomes effective. In the long run an approach to control appears to lie in the promotion of low "slenderness ratios", i. e., the ratio of stand height to mean diameter (in damaged stands typically in excess of 100). <b>Lower</b> <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratios</b> and hence more stable stands are achievable by wide initial espacements and by early non-commercial thinning.

This will {{emphasize the importance of}} developing a method for dynamic analysis of structures taking geometric nonlinearities into consideration. In order to achieve this the equations of motions are formulated, based on finite strain formula and virtual work method. To solve the equation of motion, the usual central difference method is used. The developed method is applied to two cases of columns with different <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratio.</b> The effect of introducing the nonlinear approach for different <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratios</b> of columns is investigated on natural frequency of the first three modes.

To find the suitable <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratio</b> threshold when the effect of nonlinearity becomes significant, the relationship between <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratio</b> and the maximum displacement ratio for a known loading frequency is studied. The results show that columns with higher ratio of axial loading over <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratio</b> provide a higher rate of decrease in natural frequencies.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to numerically investigate the effects of <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratios</b> and end rotational restraints on the post-buckling behavior of non-sway columns. To study the effect of end restraints, numerical solutions were generated for three different support conditions, namely, hinged-hinged, fixed-hinged and fixed-fixed.

Based on the numerical data presented in this thesis, the following conclusions can be made.  The unrestrained columns under mechanical loads do not exhibit any significant post-buckling strength.  Restrained Columns subjected to thermal loading undergo significantly smaller deformations in contrast to unrestrained columns, where deformations are relatively larger as the loads are increased only slightly above their critical levels.  The mechanical post-buckling response does not seem to depend on the <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratios</b> of the columns;whereas the thermal post-buckling response depends on the <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratios</b> of the columns with the relative deformation decreasing with <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratio</b> at a given temperature ratio.  Post buckling behavior of columns subjected to mechanical loadings does not seem to change when the rotational restraints are added whereas in case of columns subjected to thermal loading, the post-buckling response depends on the rotational restraints at the ends of the column. o For a constant <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratio,</b> the deflection ratio was found out to be the smallest for the hinged-hinged column and largest for the fixed-fixed column subjected to thermal loads at a given temperature ratio...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{built-up}} columns {{has been under}} investigation {{since the collapse of}} the Quebec Bridge in 1907, which occurred due to the failure of the lower chords. It was reported that these elements were not designed as latticed columns. It is widely accepted that built-up columns exhibit reduced shear stiffness resulting in an increase in lateral deflection. This reduction in shear stiffness leads to a reduction in the strength of the column, which may be accounted for by increasing the <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratio</b> of the built-up member to an equivalent <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratio.</b> One of the questions addressed by this research was to determine the appropriate value of this equivalent <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratio.</b> A differentiation was made between the action of a battened and a buttoned column. The second problem tackled was the need to limit the <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratio</b> of the individual members between interconnectors to something less than the <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratio</b> of the integral member. It was found that increasing this <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratio</b> decreased the strength of the column, but this could be accounted for by using the equivalent <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratio.</b> The second concern with increasing the <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratio</b> of the individual members between interconnectors was the occurrence of simultaneous local and global buckling. This interaction could also lead to a decrease in the strength of the column resulting from imperfection sensitivity. An experimental program was designed to investigate these problems. Three groups of specimens were tested. The first two groups were composed of channel sections, interconnected by batten plates, placed toe-to-toe forming a box-like section. The ends were hinged about the axis passing through the web, the X axis, and fixed about the other axis, the Y axis. The specimens with one and two interconnectors buckled about the Y axis, whereas, the specimens with more interconnectors buckled about the X axis. The third group was composed of channel sections, placed back-to-back, interconnected by batten or button plates. These specimens were hinged about the Y axis and fixed about the X axis, and buckled about the Y axis. The specimens of the experimental program were modelled using the finite element method and results were compared. Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering.
