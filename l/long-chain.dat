25|$|Examination of {{the above}} {{equation}} reveals that methane {{will always be the}} largest single product so long as α is less than 0.5; however, by increasing α close to one, the total amount of methane formed can be minimized compared to the sum of all of the various <b>long-chained</b> products. Increasing α increases the formation of <b>long-chained</b> hydrocarbons. The very <b>long-chained</b> hydrocarbons are waxes, which are solid at room temperature. Therefore, for production of liquid transportation fuels {{it may be necessary to}} crack some of the Fischer–Tropsch products. In order to avoid this, some researchers have proposed using zeolites or other catalyst substrates with fixed sized pores that can restrict the formation of hydrocarbons longer than some characteristic size (usually nnbsp&<nbsp&10). This way they can drive the reaction so as to minimize methane formation without producing lots of <b>long-chained</b> hydrocarbons. Such efforts have had only limited success.|$|R

Their unique conformational change also makes them {{of interest to the}} structural biology and protein folding research communities. The conformational-change mechanism confers certain advantages, but it also has drawbacks: serpins are vulnerable to mutations that can result in serpinopathies such as protein misfolding and the formation of inactive <b>long-chain</b> polymers. Serpin polymerisation not only reduces the amount of active inhibitor, but also leads to accumulation of the polymers, causing cell death and organ failure.|$|E

40|$|Normal {{saturated}} {{fatty acid}} (n-fatty acid) in marine sediments from coastal and pelagic environments were analyzed. The coastal sediments contain both short-chained n-fatty acids with carbon numbers from 12 to 18 and <b>long-chained</b> acids from 22 to 32, whereas the pelagic sediments contain predominantly short-chained acids. The relative abundance of short-chained to <b>long-chained</b> n-fatty acids, expressed by the molar ratio C 16 /C 26, can be an indicator to assess the depositional environment of sedimentary rocks. The ratio of <b>long-chained</b> n-fatty acids (C 22 -C 32) to the total n-fatty acids also {{has the potential to}} discriminate sedimentary environments. The indicators based on the n-fatty acids were applied to the Franciscan bedded cherts.

In August 2011, a report, based on NASA studies of meteorites found on Earth, was published suggesting DNA and RNA components (adenine, guanine, and related organic molecules) may have been formed on asteroids and comets.|$|E
5|$|Normal {{dietary fat}} {{contains}} mostly <b>long-chain</b> triglycerides (LCT). Medium-chain triglycerides are more ketogenic than LCTs because they generate more ketones {{per unit of}} energy when metabolised. Their use allows for a diet with a lower proportion of fat and {{a greater proportion of}} protein and carbohydrate, leading to more food choices and larger portion sizes. The original MCT diet developed by Peter Huttenlocher in the 1970s derived 60% of its calories from MCT oil. Consuming that quantity of MCT oil caused abdominal cramps, diarrhoea and vomiting in some children. A figure of 45% is regarded as a balance between achieving good ketosis and minimising gastrointestinal complaints. The classical and modified MCT ketogenic diets are equally effective and differences in tolerability are not statistically significant. The MCT diet is less popular in the United States; MCT oil is more expensive than other dietary fats and is not covered by insurance companies.|$|E
5|$|On the {{ketogenic}} diet, carbohydrates {{are restricted}} and so cannot provide {{for all the}} metabolic needs of the body. Instead, fatty acids are used as {{the major source of}} fuel. These are used through fatty-acid oxidation in the cell's mitochondria (the energy-producing parts of the cell). Humans can convert some amino acids into glucose by a process called gluconeogenesis, but cannot do this for fatty acids. Since amino acids are needed to make proteins, which are essential for growth and repair of body tissues, these cannot be used only to produce glucose. This could pose a problem for the brain, since it is normally fuelled solely by glucose, and most fatty acids do not cross the blood–brain barrier. Fortunately, the liver can use <b>long-chain</b> fatty acids to synthesise the three ketone bodies β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone. These ketone bodies enter the brain and substitute for glucose. Medium-chain fatty acids octonoic and heptanoic acids can cross the barrier and be used by the brain.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the investment of}} adult Dreissena polymorpha to the eggs by sampling mussels monthly from 4 - and 15 -m water depth. The fatty acid composition of eggs differed significantly between depths and over time. To assess whether temperature and food conditions led to the differences observed for mussels sampled from the two depths, mussels were reared in the laboratory under two different 3 -month temperature regimes, simulating {{the temperature of the}} lake at 4 - and 15 -m depth. Possible effects of food quality were tested in each simulation using four diets differing in fatty acid composition: Cryptomonas erosa, Nannochloropsis limnetica [rich in polyunsatu-rated fatty acids (PUFAs) and <b>long-chained</b> PUFAs (. C 18) ], Scenedesmus obliquus, and the cyanobacterium Aphan-othece sp. (deficient in <b>long-chained</b> PUFAs). In newly released eggs, specific (n– 3) and (n– 6) <b>long-chained</b> PUFAs increased when these fatty acids were available in the natural seston or in the laboratory diets. Mussels fed organisms deficient in <b>long-chained</b> PUFAs were still able to allocate arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosa-hexaenoic acid into eggs, which suggests that minimum levels of particular fatty acids were maintained in eggs by transfer from internal reserves of the female mussels to oocytes.

5|$|The archetypal {{example of}} this {{situation}} is antithrombin, which circulates in plasma in a partially inserted relatively inactive state. The primary specificity determining residue (the P1 arginine) points toward {{the body of the}} serpin and is unavailable to the protease. Upon binding a high-affinity pentasaccharide sequence within <b>long-chain</b> heparin, antithrombin undergoes a conformational change, RCL expulsion, and exposure of the P1 arginine. The heparin pentasaccharide-bound form of antithrombin is, thus, a more effective inhibitor of thrombin and factor Xa. Furthermore, both of these coagulation proteases also contain binding sites (called exosites) for heparin. Heparin, therefore, also acts as a template for binding of both protease and serpin, further dramatically accelerating the interaction between the two parties. After the initial interaction, the final serpin complex is formed and the heparin moiety is released. This interaction is physiologically important. For example, after injury to the blood vessel wall, heparin is exposed, and antithrombin is activated to control the clotting response. Understanding of the molecular basis of this interaction enabled the development of Fondaparinux, a synthetic form of Heparin pentasaccharide used as an anti-clotting drug.|$|E
5|$|The brain consumes up {{to twenty}} percent of the energy used by the human body, more than any other organ. Brain {{metabolism}} normally relies upon blood glucose as an energy source, but during times of low glucose (such as fasting, endurance exercise, or limited carbohydrate intake), the brain uses ketone bodies for fuel with a smaller need for glucose. The brain can also utilize lactate during exercise. <b>Long-chain</b> fatty acids cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, but the liver can break these down to produce ketone bodies. However, short-chain fatty acids (e.g., butyric acid, propionic acid, and acetic acid) and the medium-chain fatty acids, octanoic acid and heptanoic acid, can cross the blood–brain barrier and be metabolized by brain cells. The brain stores glucose in the form of glycogen, albeit in significantly smaller amounts than that found in the liver or skeletal muscle.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, it was {{discovered}} that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) produce more ketone bodies per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly <b>long-chain</b> triglycerides). MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the hepatic portal system rather than the lymphatic system. The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate. In 1971, Peter Huttenlocher devised a ketogenic diet where about 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk, chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on twelve children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children. The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.|$|E
