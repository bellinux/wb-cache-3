40|$|A {{model system}} for the {{partitioning}} of peripheral membrane proteins into membranes by ligand binding has been examined experimentally. Both bovine serum albumin and lysozyme partition between water and 1 -butanol {{by the addition of}} sodium p-toluene sulfonate at pH 2. 4. The partitioning is characterized by high orders of reaction: 25 and 10, respectively. Theory indicates that these high orders of reaction need not result from cooperative ligand binding in either phase, but depend primarily upon the number N of protein sites at which the transfer-promoting <b>ligant</b> binds, and on the difference in free energy of formation delta F 0 s of the protein [...] ligand complexes in the two phases. From the reaction orders and the experimental values of N, 80 for albumin and 11 for lysozyme, delta F 0 s was calculated to be [...] 0. 5 kcal/mol ( [...] 2. 1 kJ/mol) and [...] 0. 8 kcal/mol ( [...] 2. 5 kJ/mol) per ligand bound, respectively. Experiments measuring the dependence on ligand concentration of the rate of protein electrophoresis across the water/butanol interface are described. These rates increase by more than two orders of magnitude as the ligand concentration approaches the critical value for partition and are inversely dependent on the number of <b>ligant</b> sites for the two proteins studied...|$|E

The solution structures of c-Src SH 3 complexed with these peptides were solved by NMR. In addition to proline-rich, polyproline type II helix-forming core, the class I and II ligands each possesses a flanking sequence that occupies a large pocket between the RT and n-Src loops of the SH 3 domain.

These studies indicated that ionic strength has an important effect on aprotinin adsorption on immobilized trypsin, and the pH was the most significant variable in aprotinin desorption from both immobilized enzymes. The aprotinin-trypsin complex adsorption onto the IMAC matrix was not as significantly affected by changes in pH {{as it was for}} changes in ionic strength.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which metalloporphyrins escape from mitochondria has been studied in isolated rat-liver mitochondria using Co-deuteroporphyrin as the model compound. During the first 10 [...] 15 min of incubation the efflux is about 10 % of {{the total amount of}} Co-deuteroporphyrin synthesized. The efflux then increases to a second steady-state leve of 25 [...] 35 % after 30 [...] 45 min of incubation. The efflux is inversely correlated to the energy state of the mitochondria. Globin at concentrations less than 0. 4 mumol/l enhances the efflux of Co-deuteroporphyrin, but has no effect on the degree of energy coupling or on the rate of Co-deuteroporphyrin synthesis. The effect of globin can be competitively inhibited by adding haemin. Haemin (0. 5 [...] 1. 0 mumol/l) when added to the medium in the absence of globin reduces the efflux of Co-deuteroporphyrin by 20 [...] 30 %, but has no effect on the metal-chelatase activity. Neither albumin nor haemoglobin increases the efflux of Co-deuteroporphyrin from intact mitochondria. The results suggest that the efflux of metalloporphyrin is regulated in part by the energy state of the mitochondria and in part by the presence of metalloporphyrin-binding <b>ligants</b> and unattached haemin in the incubation medium...|$|R
40|$|The {{improvement}} {{in the field of}} kidney transplantation, during the last decades, has brought kindey transplantation to the top of patient preference as the best kidney replacement therapy 1. The use of marginal kidney grafts, which are highly immunogenic has become common practice because of lack of kidney donors. Inflammatory activity in the kidneys after brain death is an ongoing phenomenon. The inappropriate treatment of brain dead donor may result to primary non function (PNF) of the graft, delayed graft function (DGF) or to long term graft dysfunction and shortened graft survival. Therefore correct handling of the brain dead donor is of paramount importance. The impact of various pharmacologic agents (catecholamines, glucocorticoids, carbamylated recombinant human erythropoietin, recombinant soluble P-selectin glycoprotein <b>ligant,</b> heme oxygenase- 1, carbon monoxide, and mycophenolate mofetil) on the immunogemicity of brain dead donor kidneys is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Histone deacetylas inhibitors (HDIs) are a novel {{prospective}} {{group of}} potential anti-cancer agents, {{some of them}} being tested in a clinical setting. The major mode of action of these compounds is inhibition of the cell cycle transition and, consequently, differential regulation {{of a number of}} genes necessary for cell proliferation, while favouring expression of genes rather associated with anti-proliferative pathways and with cell death signalling. This implies a possible role of HDIs in adjuvant treatment of tumours resistant to other agents, operating via a different molecular mechanism. The TNF-related apoptosis-inducing <b>ligant</b> (TRAIL) is a promising immunological inducer of apoptosis efficient against a variety of tumours with a remarkably selective mode of action.

40|$|Following recent {{research}} works [1, 2], this work reports additional experimental and modeling studies concerning the conventional (FRP) and atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of acrylate/diacrylate monomers. In {{the framework of}} a recently developed general approach [3 - 5], kinetic models including crosslinking reactions and branching by chain transfer to polymer are discussed for FRP and ATRP polymerization systems. Besides MWD, the prediction of the z-average radius of gyration is shown to be possible for these non-linear polymers. A set of experiments was performed at 1 L scale in a batch reactor using n-butyl acrylate (BA) or methyl acrylate (MA) as monovinyl monomers and 1, 4 -Butanediol diacrylate (BDDA), 1, 6 -Hexanediol diacrylate (HDDA) or bisphenol A ethoxylate diacrylate (BEDA) as crosslinkers.

40|$|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{mutations}} at the GAP 1 locus selectively {{abolish the}} activity of the general amino acid transport system. This permease catalyses active transport of apparently all biological amino acids across the plasma membrane. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of th GAP 1 gene. The sequence contains an open reading frame of 601 codons corresponding to a polypeptide of M(r) 65578. This polypeptide is strongly hydrophobic; it exhibits three potential glycosylation sites. Hydropathy analysis suggests 12 membrane-spanning regions. The N-terminal domain is charged, it does not resemble hydrophobic signal sequences found in secreted proteins. Hence the GAP 1 gene encodes a protein with characteristics typical of integral membrane proteins translocating <b>ligants</b> across cellular membranes. The deduced amino acid sequence of GAP 1 protein presents strong similarities to those of the yeast arginine, histidine and proline permeases, suggesting a common evolutionary origin for these amino acid permeases. Nitrogen-source regulation of the GAP 1 permease is believed to occur at two distinct levels, i. e. permease synthesis and permease activity [Grenson (1983) Eur. J. Biochem. 133, 135 - 139]. Northern analysis of GAP 1 -specific transcripts in wild-type and in mutant strains is in agreement with these views and indicates that nitrogen catabolite repression of GAP 1 synthesis occurs at the RNA level.

Porém, o desenvolvimento de resistência a este fármaco e os severos efeitos colaterais, como nefrotoxicidade têm sido grandes obstáculos para um tratamento mais eficaz. A cisplatina é também usada no tratamento da leishmaniose. Neste trabalho desenvolveu-se uma metodologia para sintetizar análogos da cisplatina com ligantes derivados de aminopurinas, visando obter um produto com atividade leihmanicicida mas que apresente menor toxicidade. Foram feitos estudos para chegar à melhor rota sintética de obtenção dos ligantes e complexos representadas. A síntese do ligante {{consiste}} em duas etapas, a primeira envolve a oxidação da 6 - metilmercaptopurina até 6 -metilsulfonilpurina, a segunda etapa leva a obtenção das respectivas 6 -aminopurinas. Nesta segunda etapa foi feito um estudo relacionado ao caráter nucleofílico das aminas aromáticas. Na etapa de formação do complexo, isto é na interação entre as 6 -aminopurinas e cisplatina foram analisados alguns parâmetros como temperatura, tempo de reação, pH e solubilidade no solvente. A escolha das 6 -aminopurinas como ligantes foi fundamental, pois na literatura 1. 7 é citado a grande atividade biológica desses compostos e os protozoário da leishmania necessitam de purina do meio para sobreviver. Todas as substâncias sintetizadas foram caracterizadas através das seguintes técnicas, CHN, TGA, IV, RMN- 1 H, RMN- 13 C e espectrometria de massa (LDI). Os testes biológicos efetuados demostram que alguns compostos têm atividade leishmanicida. Cisplatin is {{a widely}} used chemotherapeutic drug {{in the treatment of}} several solid tumors. However, the resistance developed to the drug together with its severe side effects, such as nephrotoxicity, have been obstacles to a more efficient treatment. Cisplatin is also used in the treatment of leishmaniose. In this study, a methodology was developed to synthesize cisplatin with ligands derived from aminopurines, with the aim of obtaining products with antineoplasic potential and biological activity, but presenting a reduction of its toxicity. The synthesis of the ligand consists of two stages, the first involves the oxidation of the 6 -methylmercaptopurine to 6 -methylsulphonilpurine and is followed by the aminolysis of the latter to respective 6 -aminopurines. In this second stage a study was made of the nucleofilic character of these aromatic amines. In the complex formation stage, that is, in the interaction between the 6 -aminopurines and cisplatin, parameters such as temperature, time of reaction, pH and solvent solubility were analyzed. The relationship between the group in the position 6 of these 6 -aminopurines and their reactivity with cisplatin was also studied. The choice of 6 -aminopurines as <b>ligants</b> was fundamental, the literature 1. 7 shows a huge biological activity of these composts and the leishmania protozoary needs the purine media to survine.

We used site-directed mutagenesis to change charged or hydrophobic amino acid residues to alanines to identify regions of MC 159 that are critical for protection from apoptosis and for protein-protein interactions. Surprisingly, while MC 159 is thought to block apoptosis by binding to Fas-associated death domain (FADD) or caspase- 8, several mutants that lost apoptosis blocking activity still bound to both FADD and caspase- 8. Mutations in the predicted hydrophobic patch 1 and α 2 regions of both death effector domains (DEDs) within MC 159 resulted in loss of the ability to bind to FADD or caspase- 8 and to block apoptosis. Amino acid substitutions in the RXDL motif located in the α 6 region of either DED resulted in loss of protection from apoptosis induced by Fas, TNF, and TRAIL and abolished the ability of MC 159 to block death effector filament formation. Thus, charged or hydrophobic amino acids in three regions of the MC 159 DEDs (hydrophobic patch 1, α 2, and α 6) are critical for the protein’s ability to interact with cellular proteins and to block apoptosis...|$|E

Changes in u. v. absorbance of {{the enzyme}} were used to measure binding, and the dissociation constant was determined over a range of pH values. The ligands were 2 -phosphoglycollate and rac-glycerol 3 -phosphate (only the D-isomer, sn-glycerol 1 -phosphate, binds appreciably). Non-linear regression was used to fit calculated curves to the experimental points and hence to compare different models. Both active sites in the dimeric enzyme probably bound 2 -phosphoglycollate, without any interaction between the sites. The results of crystallographic analysis [phillips, Rivers, Sternberg, Thornton & Wilson (1977) Biochem.

Our aim was to investigate how differentiation of human preadipocytes affects the distribution of insulin receptors (IR) and IGF-I receptors (IGF-IR) and other cell characteristics. Preadipocytes were differentiated using indomethacine, dexamethasone, isobutyl-methylxantine (IBMX) and high concentration of insulin. Gene expression was quantified by real-time RT-PCT in preadipocytes (PA), differentiated preadipocytes (dPA) and mature adipocytes (mAD). The amount of expressed receptor protein was analyzed using receptor specific ELISAs and Western blot. We also studied DNA synthesis with radiolabeled thymidine incorporation and glucose accumulation with radiolabeled glucose. Differentiation of PA increased gene expression of IR but not IGF-IR, GLUT 4, growth hormone receptor (GHR) and adiponectin appeared or increased. In PA and dPA only IR-A was expressed whereas also IR-B was detected in mAD. By Western blot and ELISA, IR and IGF-IR was phosphorylated by their own <b>ligant</b> at 1 nM and in dPA the acitivation of both receptors was stimulated by IGF-I, but not insulin, at 1 nM. Accumulation of glucose in PA was increased by insulin at 10 nM and by IGF-I at 1 nM and 10 nM. DNA synthesis was increased by insulin and IGF-I at 10 nM.

40|$|As infecções respiratórias agudas (IRAs) constituem a {{principal}} causa de mortalidade infantil no mundo, e o Vírus Respiratório Sincicial Humano (hRSV – Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus) é um dos principais agentes etiológicos das IRAs. Este vírus pertencente à família Paramyxoviridae, é envelopado, de simetria helicoidal, cujo genoma é RNA de fita simples não segmentada. A infectividade do vírus está relacionada com suas proteínas de membrana e dentre elas a glicoproteína G, que é responsável pela ligação do vírus à célula hospedeira e conseqüente instalação da infecção. Esta glicoproteína exerce um importante papel como antígeno de reconhecimento, sendo alvo para identificação do RSV através de anticorpos. Existem evidências de que esta proteína se liga a receptores glicosilados na célula hospedeira, porém ainda não foi descrito um receptor para a proteína G na célula. Para elucidar estes mecanismos de interação, foram realizados estudos experimentais e teóricos desta proteína. Os domínios solúveis da região N-terminal (1 a 38 aa) e C-terminal (67 a 298 aa), com 231 aminoácidos da glicoproteína G do hRSV foram clonados e a região N-terminal foi expressa em bactéria BL 21 pLysS. Em paralelo, foi realizada a caracterização teórica desta proteína, e foram avaliados os possíveis sítios de interação da mesma com glicosaminoglicanos (heparina). Foram obtidos dois modelos teóricos para a proteína G do hRSV, bem como dois modelos de interação com heparina, determinando portanto, um possível sítio de ocorrência de interação. O conhecimento da estrutura da proteína G é de grande importância para elucidar a composição da estrutura e os mecanismos de interação com potenciais ligantes e deste modo, em um passo posterior, propor mecanismos de reconhecimento celular pelo hRSV, através de glicosaminoglicanosAcute Respiratory Infections (ARI) {{are the leading}} cause of infant mortality in the world, and the Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (hRSV) {{is one of the main}} agents of ARI. This virus belongs to Paramyxoviridae family, has a lipidic envelope, helical symmetry and its genome is a single-stranded RNA. The viral infectivity is related to its membrane proteins and among them the G glycoprotein, which is responsible for binding the virus to the host cell and consequent infection. This glycoprotein plays an important role as antigen recognition, being the target for hRSV identification through antibodies. There are evidences that this protein binds to host cell glycosylated receptors, but it has not been described a receptor for G protein in the cell yet. To elucidate these interaction mechanisms and understand the process of viral infectivity, we performed experimental and theoretical studies of this protein. The soluble domains of the N-terminal (1 - 38 aa) and C-terminal regions (67 - 298 aa), with 231 amino acids of the hRSV G glycoprotein have been cloned and the N-terminal region was expressed in BL 21 pLysS bacteria. In a later trial these peptides will be purified and biophysical tests will be done. It was also performed a theoretical characterization of this protein, to assess the possible interaction sites with glycosaminoglycan (heparin). It were obtained two theoretical models for the hRSV G protein as well as two interaction models with heparin, in order to determine a possible site of occurrence of interaction. Knowledge of G protein structure is of great importance to elucidate the mechanism of viral infectivity and interaction mechanisms with potential <b>ligants,</b> and the results obtained in this work will allow us, in a later step, to propose mechanisms of cellular recognition by hRSV through glycosaminoglycan...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} iron {{to exist in}} various {{oxidation}} states (the + 2 and + 3 valence states {{are the most important}} ones) makes it an essential element in many cellular processes associated with basic physiological cell functions. On the other hand, the same high redox potential that enables iron to readily switch between the ferrous and ferric states also makes it potentially toxic. Thus, {{it is not surprising that}} nature handles iron with the utmost care and iron homeostasis is carefully regulated by sophisticated mechanisms in order to avoid such injurious interactions. Although iron is usually bound with high affinity to specialized proteins to abrogate the deleterious effects of free iron during oxidative stress, a distinct minor fraction of total cellular iron is thought to be loosely bound to diverse intracellular <b>ligants</b> and serves as a crossroad of cell iron metabolism. This fraction of iron is called redox-active iron and in the presence of H 2 O 2, it catalyzes the generation of the extremely reactive hydroxyl radical (HO.) via the Fenton Reaction. Apart from hydrogen peroxide’s cytotoxic effects, in recent years it has become established that the intracellular redox status play critical roles for the determination of cell “fate” by eliciting a wide variety of cellular responses, such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Many intracellular signalling pathways involved in ROS induced cellular responses are regulated by the intracellular redox state, which depends on the balance between the levels of oxidizing and reducing equivalents. Although, the role of H 2 O 2 as a messenger in cell signalling is strongly supported by extensive experimental evidence, little information is available regarding the role of iron in such processes. In the present study, we made an efford to investigate if redox-active iron ions play any role in the molecular mechanism of apoptosis-induced by H 2 O 2 and to elucidate the exact chemical reactions that take plays in this process. Among several iron chelators, we selected desferrioxamine (DFO), a membrane-impermeant, strong and rather specific iron chelator, which is taken up by fluid phase endocytosis, thus passing late endosomes before reaching lysosomes and other intracellular compartments. Pre-incubation of cells with DFO resulted in the partial and almost full reduction of the characteristic ladder pattern of oligonucleosomal DNA fragments, as well as in the inhibition of the extrernalization of phosphatidylserine in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, indicating the importance of iron ions in the signaling of apoptosis-induced by H 2 O 2. The pathway of the apoptotic procedure was examined step by step, in an effort to indicate the exact point of iron involvement. It was revealed that iron chelation blocked the activation of caspase cascade, the release of cyt-C to the cytosol, the translocation of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria and the phosphorylation of JNK. The observation that iron chelation inhibited the oxidation and sequestration of Trx- 1 from the complex of ASK 1 (which is the major upstream kinase of JNK activation in the signaling of apoptosis), as well as the oxidation of DUSP 1 (which is one of the most well-known tyrosine phosphatases of JNK), revealed that H 2 O 2 requires iron in order to induce such oxidations. Thereafter, the data presented here indicate that iron-mediated oxidations of specific cysteine residues may represent a common mechanism through which H 2 O 2 exerts its second-messenger role in the signal transduction pathway of apoptosis. Whether this is an isolated observation or it represents a generalized phenomenon dictating H 2 O 2 -induced oxidations of sulfhydryl groups remains to be explored. ...|$|R

Os espectros no infravermelho dos complexos cis - [Fe(cyclam) (TCNX) Cl]Cl, onde TCNX representa os ligantes TCNQ ou TCNE, apresentaram um maior nÃmero de bandas referentes aos estiramentos CN, comparativamente aos ligantes livres, confirmando a alteraÃÃo da simetria do ligante causada pela coordenaÃÃo do metal. Com base nos deslocamentos destas freqÃÃncias para menores valores, comparativamente ao ligante livre, foi possÃvel identificar que os ligantes TCNQ e TCNE estÃo coordenados em sua forma radicalar, estado de oxidaÃÃo â 1, sugerindo assim a ocorrÃncia de um processo de transferÃncia de elÃtrons do centro metÃlico, previamente reduzido (Fe 2 +), para os ligantes TCNX. Os potenciais redox dos Ãtomos de ferro, nos complexos com os ligantes polinitrialados TCNQ (693 mV vs ENH) e TCNE (854 mV vs ENH), foram deslocados para potenciais mais positivos, comparativamente ao observado no complexo precursor cis-[Fe(cyclam) Cl 2]Cl (405 mV vs ENH), indicando assim um forte deslocamento de densidade eletrÃnica d&# 960; para os orbitais de simetria &# 960; dos ligantes TCNX. Os processos centrados nos ligantes coordenados ficaram mais prÃximos do que nos ligantes livres, indicando uma diminuiÃÃo na barreira de transferÃncia de elÃtrons, que segundos dados da literatura leva a uma melhor conduÃÃo elÃtrica.

The infrared spectra of the cis-[Fe(cyclam) ox]PF 6 complex allowed to identify the coordination of the oxalate ligand to the iron metal in a bidentate mode {{as well as to}} suggest the presence of the macrocycle in the coordination sphere of the metal. The redox potential of the complex was observed at â 39 mV vs Ag/AgCl. The potential is dislocated 240 mV for more positive potential when compared to that observed for the precursor complex cis-[Fe(cyclamCl 2]Cl. This effect {{can be attributed to the}} stronger &# 963; effect of the oxalate ligand when compared to the chlorine. The UV-Vis spectra of the complex, presented three bands: 229 nm, attributed to a cyclam intraligand transition and the bands 293 nm and 357 nm, referring to ligand to metal electronic transfer from &# 960; orbitals of the oxalate to d&# 960;* of the metal. The photochemical experiments proved the great sensibility of the complex to the light presence, being observed the reactivity effect of the complex formed after the light exposition by the formation of the trans-[Fe(cyclam) acet 2]PF 6 complex. Through the Ray-X obtained of the crystal of the trans-[Fe(cyclam) acet 2]PF 6 complex was possible to identify the coordination of two molecules of acetate at the trans position, as well as to identify the disposition of the cyclam ligand on the plane in a trans-III arrange. The infrared spectrum of the complexes cis - [Fe(cyclam) (TCNX) Cl]Cl, where the TCNX represent the ligands TCNQ and TCNE, present a great number of bands referring to the &# 957;CN, when compared with the ligands not coordinated, confirming the symetry changed induced by the metal coordination. Through the wavenumber variation of these bands was possible to identify that the TCNQ and TCNE ligands are coordinated in your radical way, oxidation state â 1, suggestion this way the occurrence of a electron transfer from the iron, previously reduced (Fe+ 2), to the TCNX ligands. The redox potentials of the iron metals in the complexes with the polinitrilate ligands TCNQ (693 mV vs ENH) and TCNE (854 mV vs ENH) were dislocated for more positive potentials, when compared to the cis-[Fe(cyclam) Cl 2]Cl precursor complex (405 mV vs ENH), indicating the occurrence of an electronic density transfer to the TCNX molecules. The two potentials of the ligands on the complexes were closer than the ligands not coordinated, this approximation of the potential indicate a decrease of the inner electron transfer. The electronic spectra of the complexes, showed bands in the low energy region, attributed to a charge transfer LMCT, from the TCNX p&# 960; orbital to the metal d&# 960;* orbital. In the cis-[Fe(cyclam) (TCNQ) Cl]Cl complex, the band was observed at 764 nm while in the complex with the TCNE ligand this band was observed at 861 nm. Also, the complexes presented bands at 557 nm (TCNE complex) and 568 nm (TCNQ complex) referring to the LMCT transitions from the chlorine atoms to the iron metal reinforcing the assignment of the (Fe+ 3) oxidation state for the metal center...|$|R
40|$|Silicone rubber (poly(dimethyl siloxane; PDMS)), is {{extensively}} {{used for}} biomedical implants {{due to its}} low toxicity, flexible processing techniques, long-term endurance and good blood compatibility. However, the presence of low molecular weight organic molecules and catalyst residues that cause host systemic inflammatory reactions. The hydrophobic nature of PDMS also allows microbial adhesion followed by infection. Hydrophilic PDMS surfaces would be of great value in inhibiting biofilm formation thus prolonging the lifetime of the implants. This could be obtained by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The robustness and versatility of ATRP allow the preparation of functional bioactive surfaces, including antifouling, antibacterial, stimuliresponsive, biomolecule-coupled and micropatterned surfaces. [1 - 3] We aim at establishing the experimental conditions allowing the surface-grafting of polyethylene glycol methacrylate (PEGMA) by surface attaching an initiator (1 - trichlorosilyl- 2 -(chloromethylphenyl) ethane) onto PDMS (Sylgard ® 184). Here, cooper is {{being used as a}} metal catalyst and 2, 2 '-Bipyridine as a <b>ligant.</b> Polymerizations are being assayed in aqueous media. The native smooth and transparent surface of the PDMS could be preserved following polymerization (as confirmed by SEM). FTIR-ATR also showed the presence of PEGMA polymer chains. By contact angle measurement, a change in the surface hydrophobicity was observed, the values changing from 114 º to 60 º, following 30 h polymerization. Work is in progress to optimize the modification of PDMS by PEGMA surface-ATRP. This implies following up the polymer chain growth kinetics, surface characterization by XPS, FTIR-ATR, SEM and contact angle measurements.

Neste trabalho, foram estudadas as propriedades fotofisicas de alguns compostos de coordenacao de renio(I), fac-[Re(CO) 3 (NN) L] 0 /+ 1 (NN = 2, 2 f-bipiridina ou 2, 2 f-bipirimidina; L = Cloreto (Cl-), piridina (py), 2 -aminometilpiridina (ampy) ou 2 -fenilpiridina (phpy), e [Cl(CO) 3 Re(bpm) Re(CO) 3 Cl]. Os compostos sintetizados foram caracterizados quanto as suas propriedades na espectroscopia de ressonancia magnetica nuclear de 1 H (1 H RMN), absorcao e emissao na regiao do Ultravioleta- Visivel (UV-Vis) e espectroscopia na regiao do Infravermelho (IV). Os espectros eletronicos de absorcao na regiao de UV-Vis evidenciaram que os compostos sintetizados apresentaram altos valores na absortividade molar (na ordem de 104 L. mol- 1. cm- 1) e exibiram na regiao analisada transicoes intraligante (1 IL¿Î¨¿Î*) do ligante polipiridinico e do ligante piridinico e transicoes de transferencia de carga metal-ligante (1 MLCTRe¨NN). Para o composto binuclear de renio(I), [Cl(CO) 3 Re(bpm) Re(CO) 3 Cl], observou-se uma prolongamento da banda de absorcao, isto e, o composto absorve radiacao visivel ate aproximadamente 600 nm [...] Os espectros de emissao dos compostos fac-[Re(CO) 3 (bpy) L] 0 /+ 1 (L = Cl, py, ampy ou phpy) apresentaram uma banda larga e nao estruturada, sendo que o estado excitado 3 MLCTRe¨bpy e o responsavel pela emissao. O composto fac-[Re(CO) 3 (bpy) Cl] apresentou em diclorometano (CH 2 Cl 2) uma emissao maxima em 612 nm e 0, 005 de rendimento quantico, enquanto que os compostos fac-[Re(CO) 3 (bpy) L]+ 1 (py, ampy ou phpy) apresentaram a emissao em 548, 558, 526 nm e rendimento quantico de 0, 216, 0, 078, 0, 254, respectivamente. Portanto, a substituicao do ligante cloro pelo ligante piridinico provoca um deslocamento hipsocromico da emissao e tambem a um aumento. no rendimento quantico, tendo em vista que o ligante cloro reduz a eficiencia do cruzamento intersistema. Os compostos fac-[Re(CO) 3 (bpm) Cl] e [Cl(CO) 3 Re(bpm) Re(CO) 3 Cl] apresentaram uma emissao relativamente baixa em diferentes solventes, na ordem de 10 - 4. Enquanto que o estado responsavel pela emissao do composto {{mononuclear}} e 3 MLCTRe¨bpm, por outro lado quando ocorre a coordenacao com outro atomo de renio, [Cl(CO) 3 Re(bpm) Re(CO) 3 Cl], existe a desestabilizacao deste estado, tendo assim, o estado excitado 3 ILbpm responsavel pela emissao. O estado excitado de mais baixa energia 3 MLCT para os compostos fac-[Re(CO) 3 (bpm) Cl] e fac-[Re(CO) 3 (bpy) L]+, (L= py, ampy ou phpy) e os diferentes valores observados em meios rigidos confirmaram a sensibilidade do estado excitado a rigidez do meio, observou-se o efeito rigidocromico. Consequentemente, estes compostos podem ser utilizados no desenvolvimento de dispositivos moleculares. In this work, it {{were studied}} the photophysical properties of some coordination compounds of rhenium(I), fac-[Re(CO) 3 (NN) L] 0 /+ 1 (NN = 2, 2 '- bipyridine, bpy, or 2, 2 '-bipyrimidine, bpm; L = chloride (Cl), pyridine (py), 2 -aminomethylpyridine (ampy) or 2 -phenylpyridine (phpy), and [Cl(CO) 3 Re(bpm) Re(CO) 3 Cl]]. The synthesized compounds {{were characterized by}} nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of 1 H (1 H NMR), absorption and emission in the Ultraviolet- Visible region (UV - VIS) and spectroscopy in infrared region (IR). The electronic absorption spectra in the UV-Vis region showed that the synthesized compounds presented high molar absorptivity (in the order of 104 L. mol- 1. cm- 1) and exhibited in the analyzed region intraligand transitions (1 IL¿Î¨¿Î*) of the polypyridyl <b>ligant</b> and pyridine, as well as metal to ligand charge transfer transitions (1 MLCTRe ¨ NN). For binuclear compound of rhenium(I), [Cl(CO) 3 Re(bpm) Re(CO) 3 Cl], there was a prolongation of the absorption band, i. e., the compound absorbs visible radiation up to approximately 600 nm. The emissions spectra of the compounds fac-[Re(CO) 3 (bpy) L] 0 /+ 1 (L = Cl-, py, ampy or phpy) exhibited a broad and unstructured band assigned to the lowest lying excited state, 3 MLCTRe ¨ bpy. The compound fac-[Re(CO) 3 (bpy) Cl] presented in dichloromethane (CH 2 Cl 2) a maximum emission at 612 nm and quantum yield of 0. 005, while the compounds fac-[Re(CO) 3 (bpy) L]+ 1 (py, ampy or phpy) presented the emission in 548, 558, 526 nm and quantum yield of 0. 216, 0. 078, 0. 254, respectively. Therefore, the substitution of the chloride <b>ligant</b> by pyridine causes a hypsochromic shift in the emission, {{as well as an}} increase in the quantum yield, since the chloride <b>ligant</b> reduces the efficiency of intersystem crossing. The fac-[Re(CO) 3 (bpm) Cl] and [Cl(CO) 3 Re(bpm) Re(CO) 3 Cl] compounds presented a relatively low emission in CH 3 CN, in the order of 10 - 4. While the 3 MLCTRe ¨ bpm was the responsible for the mononuclear emission, when the coordination to an another atom of rhenium occurred [Cl(CO) 3 Re(bpm) Re(CO) 3 Cl], this state was destabilized, and thus, the 3 ILbpm excited state became the responsible to emission. The state excited of lower energy 3 MLCT for compounds fac-[Re(CO) 3 (bpm) Cl], fac-[Re(CO) 3 (bpy) L]+ (L = py, ampy or phpy) and the different values observed in rigid media have confirmed the sensitivity of the excited state to the medium rigidity, due to the rigidochromic effect. Consequently, these compounds can be used in the development of molecular devices...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic {{steatohepatitis}} (NASH) {{develops in}} the absence of chronic and excessive alcohol consumption. However, it remains unknown whether moderate alcohol consumption aggravates liver inflammation in pre-existing NASH condition. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were first fed ad libitum with Lieber-DeCarli high-fat diet (71 % energy from fat) for 6 weeks to induce NASH, as demonstrated previously. Afterwards, these rats were continuously fed with high-fat diet (HFD, 55 % total energy from fat) or high fat plus alcohol diet (HFA, 55 % energy from fat and 16 % energy from alcohol) for an additional 4 weeks. Pathological lesions including fat accumulation and inflammatory foci in liver were examined and graded. Lipid peroxidation and apoptotic hepatocytes in the liver were assessed. The mRNA expressions of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and TNF receptor 1 (TNF-R 1), Fas death receptor (Fas) and Fas <b>ligant</b> (FasL), IL- 1 beta and IL- 12 were determined by real-time PCR. Protein levels of total and cleaved caspase- 3, CYP 2 E 1, Bax, and Bcl- 2 were measured by western blotting. RESULTS: The number of hepatic inflammatory foci and apoptotic hepatocytes were significantly increased in rats fed with HFA as compared with those in HFD-fed rats. The aggravated inflammatory response and cellular apoptosis mediated by HFA were associated with elevated mRNA expression of Fas/FasL and cleaved caspase- 3 protein. Although no significant differences were observed between HFD and HFA groups, the levels of lipid peroxidation, Bax and Bcl- 2 protein concentration, and mRNA levels of other inflammatory cytokines were significantly higher in these 2 groups than those in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that even moderate alcohol consumption can cause more hepatic inflammation and cellular apoptosis in a pre-existing NASH condition...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Genetic {{modification}} of autologous hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) is a promising clinical intervention to cure inherited monogenic diseases. Successful gene therapy trials {{have already been}} conducted using CD 34 + cells from bone marrow and from mobilized peripheral blood. In this regard, cord blood (CB) represents an attractive source of HSCs due to its high concentration of high proliferative HSPC and increased susceptibility to be transduced by lentiviral vectors. Unfortunately, the major disadvantage is {{the limited number of}} HSC in the CB collection. Consequently, ex-vivo expansion of CB-HSC is desirable to extend clinical applications. Purposes: To investigate the ability of UCB-cd 34 + cells to be expanded in serum-free media supplemented with the early acting hematopoietic cytokines SCF,TPO and Flt- 3 <b>ligant</b> (STF) and to characterize CD 34 + cells subtypes, clonogenic capacity and gene expression profile during expansion. We also wanted to investigate the susceptibility of the expanded cd 34 + cells to be transduced by a GFP-lentiviral vector (LV-GFP) Material and Methods: CD 34 + immunoselected cells from 10 UCB were grown for 8 days in customized serum-free medium formulated for HSC expansion, supplemented with STF cytokines. Numbers end frequency of CD 34 +cells and co-expression of the primitive surface antigens (CD 38, CD 133, CD 90) was evaluated during expansion. Colonies developed in methylcellulose were scored for enumeration ad typing. LV-GFP transduction efficiency was evaluated in CD 34 + cells cultured for 4 days in expansion medium plus STF and for 24 hrs in X-vivo 10 medium with STF±IL- 3 cytokines; the last condition slightly expands CD 34 + cells (1. 3 fold) and are currently used for HSPC-lentivector transduction in gene therapy clinical trials. The transduction efficiency was evaluated by measuring the percentage of GFP+ cells in the bulk and in colonies developed in methylcellulose and the VCN/cell by Q-PCR. Gene expression profiles were analyzed by human whole genome Agilent microarray Technology to detect differentially expressed genes between expanded, ex-vivo medium cultured and un-cultured cells. Results: We found an average of 8 fold-increase CD 34 +cells at day 4 and of 22 fold- increase at day 8 of culture. The frequency of CD 34 + was maintained at day 4 and declined of about 50...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2000 This thesis {{presents}} {{the application of}} Flow and Sequential Injection technologies to problems of biomolecular interaction analysis. Both biochemical and biological systems are addressed. The biochemical application involved {{the development of a}} Sequential Injection-based Biosensor (SIB) for the automated investigation of biomolecular binding phenomena. Based on Flow Injection Renewable Surface (FIRS) technology, this system enables renewal of the sensing surface for individual analyses, thus rendering regeneration of the surface unnecessary. Here, the renewable surface format is combined with the lab-on-valve flowcell design and fiber optic-based UV/vis detection {{for the first time to}} produce a flexible, multi-purpose biosensor. Additionally, precise fluidic control allows the generation of a "square impulse" flow profile which facilitates analysis of biomolecular interaction data using the first order rate equation. The SIB system presented here is used for the determination of relative affinities for a panel of monoclonal antibodies for an immobilized <b>ligant.</b> The commercially available BIAcore instrument, which uses surface plasmon resonance to evaluate biomolecular interactions, re{{presents the}} standard in biosensor instrumentation. Therefore, comparison is made between results from BIAcore and those obtained with the SIB system. Results confirm that SIB yields comparable affinity ranking data to the BIAcore instrument. Cellular calcium response dynamics examined by Flow Injection Microscopy (FIM) in a plated-cell format constitute the biological system of interest. An epifluorescent microscope provides detection of the cellular response to stimulant by means of the calcium indicator, fura- 2. Application of the stimulant is controlled via a Flow Injection system. Main features of this work are the precise fluidic control and fine temporal response engendered in the plated-cell FIM system. Because stimulant is applied in a brief, well defined pulse, temporal components to cellular response can be examined. Further, the plated-cell format allows individual cells, or sets of cells, to be targeted for observation. Repetitive stimulation of the targeted cells controls for biological variation as well as facilitating the study of response desensitization. The development of a quick, accurate automated method for the determination of dose-response relationships using this system is presented. In addition, the capacitative influx of calcium from the extracellular medium is identified and characterized...|$|E
40|$|Das Wissen über die immunologischen Vorgänge während und nach einer Plasmodieninfektion, vor allem in der Schwangerschaft, ist sehr begrenzt. Auch die Auswirkungen einer Schwangerschafts-assoziierten Malaria auf das kindliche Immunsystem, sind bisher ungenügend erforscht. Anteile des P. falciparum {{erythrocyte}} {{membrane protein}} 1 (PfEMP 1) (hier vor allem das VAR 2 CSA Protein) vermittelt die Adhärenz infizierter Erythrozyten an Chondroitinsulphat A (CSA) des plazentaren Synzytiotrophoblasten. Die Sequestration der Erythrozyten im intervillösen Raum ist ein Charakteristikum der Pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM). Letztere geht mit einer erhöhten Anfälligkeit des Neugeborenen für diese Krankheit einher und vermutlich induziert eine transplazentare Passage von Parasitenantigenen bzw. kompletten Parasiten immunregulatorische Vorgänge innerhalb des Säuglings. Die für die Bindung von CSA verantwortliche Region auf dem PfEMP 1 wurde als Duffy Binding-Like (DBL) –y 3 Domäne identifiziert. Ziel der Studie war es, die Aktivierbarkeit immunkompetenter T-Zellen in Nabelschnur- und periphervenösem Blut von Müttern mit unterschiedlicher Schwangerschaftsanamnese bezüglich einer P. falciparum Infektion durch Bestandteile dieser Domäne zu untersuchen. Hierfür bestimmten wir die Plasmaspiegel der T-Zell Zytokine Interferon Gamma (IFN-y), Interleukin 10 (IL 10) und 13 (IL 13) sowie der Immunglobuline G (IgG) und M (IgM) nach in vitro Stimulation durch vier Peptidisolate aus hochgradig konserviert exprimierten Arealen der DBL –y 3 Domäne in Zentralafrika häufig vorkommender Parasitenpopulationen. Eine plazentare P. falciparum Infektion zum Zeitpunkt der Geburt ließ sich mit einer erhöhten Anzahl DBL –y 3 Domäne spezifischer CD 3 + Interleukin 10 positiver T-Zellen (CD 3 + IL- 10 +ThZ) im Nabelschnurblut assoziieren, während eine vor Geburt erfolgreich durchgeführte Eradikation mit einer erhöhten Aktivität CD 3 + Interferon Gamma positiver T-Zellen (CD 3 + IFN-y+ThZ) einherging. DBL –y 3 spezifische IgM konnten in 12 der 60 (20 %) Nabelschnurblutproben aus Schwangerschaften mit positiver Malariaanamnese nachgewiesen werden. Das Vorkommen mütterlicher IgG Ak mit Spezifität gegenüber eines der Peptide zeigte ein von der Parität abhängiges Profil. Dies unterstützt die These einer gegen Schwangerschafts-assoziierte Malaria protektiven Immunreaktion polyklonaler anti-PfEMP 1 Antikörper. Die erhobenen Daten demonstrieren, dass Peptide, die dem Exprimat der konservativen Regionen der DBL –y 3 Domäne auf PfEMP 1 entsprechen, sowohl in P. falciparum infizierten Müttern als auch in deren Nachkommen eine immunogene Wirkung induzieren. The knowledge about immunological phenomena {{in the context}} of malaria is very limited, especially concerning pregnancy-associated malaria. Further investigation also is needed to elucidate the impact of placental P. falciparum infection on the fetal immune competence. Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP 1) mediates the adherence of p. falciparum infected erythrocytes to placental syncytiotrophoblasts via interactions with chondroitin sulfate A (CSA), a characteristic of pregnancy-associated malaria. As corresponding <b>ligant</b> on PfEMP 1 the Duffy Binding-Like (DBL) –y 3 domain was identified. Pregnancy-associated malaria predicts increased susceptibility of newborns to malaria, and it is postulated that transplacental passage of parasite antigen induces immune regulatory activity in the neonate. The study aimed to examine the immune responsiveness to the DBL-y 3 domain, in cord and maternal venous blood obtained from pregnancies with various histories of P. falciparum infection. We assessed in vitro T-cell cytokine and plasma immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM responses to four peptides corresponding to highly conserved regions of a DBL-y 3 domain common to central African parasite isolates. The presence of placental P. falciparum infection at delivery was associated with elevated frequencies of DBL-y 3 peptide-specific CD 3 + interleukin- 10 -positive T cells in cord blood, while treatment and clearance of infection prior to delivery was associated with elevated frequencies of CD 3 + gamma interferon-positive T cells. DBL-y 3 peptide-specific IgM antibodies were detected in 12 of 60 (20 %) cord plasma samples from those born to mothers with P. falciparum infection during pregnancy. Consistent with polyclonal anti-PfEMP 1 antibody responses that are associated with protection against pregnancy-associated malaria, the presence of maternal IgG antibodies with specificity for one of the DBL-y 3 peptides showed a parity-dependent profile. These data demonstrate that peptides corresponding to conserved regions of the DBL-y 3 domain of PfEMP 1 are immunogenic in P. falciparum infected mothers and their offspring...|$|E
40|$|O escorpião amarelo Tityus serrulatus (Ts) é considerado a espécie mais perigosa do Brasil, e muitas das toxinas de sua peçonha já foram isoladas e caracterizadas. No entanto, as frações XIIA e XIIB, obtidas da cromatografia de troca iônica da peçonha de Ts, possuem várias toxinas de baixa massa {{molecular}} ainda não caracterizadas. Através da combinação de técnicas de RP-FPLC em colunas C 8 e C 18, espectrometria de massas e/ou sequenciamento amino-terminal, foi possível isolar e identificar os componentes destas frações, bem como realizar as caracterizações estrutural, por RMN, e eletrofisiológica, por Two Microelectrode Voltage Clamp, de algumas neurotoxinas isoladas. Foram escolhidas três toxinas de interesse: Ts 11, Ts 9 e Ts 1 -G. Nossos resultados mostram que a Ts 11 foi capaz de bloquear canais para potássio dependentes de voltagem (Kv) : Kv 1. 2, Kv 1. 3, Kv 4. 2, Kv 10. 1, hERG, e Shaker IR, bloqueando em 25 %, 27 %, 25 %, 15 %, 12 %, e 10 % as correntes de potássio, respectivamente. A Ts 11 possui uma estrutura única (estrutura obtida por RMN) : ICK scaffold sem os elementos de estrutura secundária (alfa-hélice ou fita-beta). Esta estrutura diferenciada, somada à atividade biológica caracterizada neste estudo, evidencia uma nova subfamília de KTxs, a qual foi denominada como ?-KTx, sendo a Ts 11 o primeiro membro desta subfamília: ?-KTx 1. 1. A caracterização funcional da Ts 9 mostra que a mesma não apresenta atividade bloqueadora sobre os canais Kv testados (Kv 1. 1; Kv 1. 2; Kv 1. 3; Kv 1. 4; Kv 1. 5; Kv 1. 6; Kv 2. 1; Kv 3. 1; Kv 4. 2; Kv 7. 2; Kv 10. 1 hERG e Shaker IR), na concentração de 100 nM. Apesar da Ts 9 não ter bloqueado os canais testados, ela apresenta estrutura e resíduoschave que sugerem sua ação em Kvs e estudo anteriormente publicado mostra que ela é um potente ligante de canais para potássio ativados por cálcio de baixa condutância (SK). Também foi conduzido um estudo comparativo entre a Ts 1 e sua isoforma precursora Ts 1 -G nos canais para sódio dependentes de voltagem Nav 1. 1 - 1. 8 e DmNav 1, a fim de analisar a importância da amidação C-terminal. A Ts 1 madura possui região C-terminal amidada, enquanto que sua isoforma Ts 1 -G não é amidada, pois apresenta uma Gly na região Cterminal (última etapa de transformação pós-traducional, anterior a ação da enzima ?- amidante). A Ts 1 -G não apresentou ação nos canais (Nav) na concentração testada (100 nM), enquanto que a Ts 1 (100 nM) age como ?- toxina, reduzindo o limiar de excitação dos canais Nav e/ou reduzindo as correntes de sódio, evidenciando que a amidação C-terminal é importante para a atividade biológica da toxina madura. Adicionalmente, nas análises por MALDI/TOF das frações XIIA e XIIB, foram encontrados 45 componentes cujas massas moleculares não correspondem a de toxinas já isoladas, abrindo perspectivas para a identificação de moléculas com potencial uso biotecnológico, visto que toxinas com ação em canais iônicos podem ser ferramentas valiosas para a elucidação das características farmacológicas, fisiológicas e estruturais dos seus alvos. The yellow scorpion Tityus serrulatus (Ts) {{is considered}} the most dangerous species of Brazil, and several toxins present in its venom have been already isolated and characterized. However, fractions XIIA and XIIB obtained from ion exchange chromatography of Ts crude venom, presented many low molecular weight toxins which have not been characterized yet. Through a combination of RP-FPLC technique using C 8 and C 18 columns, mass spectrometry and / or amino terminal sequencing, {{it was possible to}} isolate and identify the components of these fractions, as well as perform structural characterization thru NMR and electrophysiological characterization using Two Microelectrode Voltage Clamp, of some of the neurotoxins isolated. It was choosen three toxins of interest: Ts 11, Ts 9 and Ts 1 -G. Our results show that Ts 11 was able to block voltage gated potassium channels (Kv) : Kv 1. 2, Kv 1. 3, Kv 4. 2, Kv 10. 1, hERG, and Shaker IR, blocking 25 %, 27 %, 25 % 15 %, 12 % and 10 % of the potassium currents, respectively. Ts 11 has an unique structure (structure obtained thru NRM technique) : ICK scaffold without the elements of secondary structure (alpha helix or beta-sheet). Additionaly, the differentiated structure and functional characterization, Ts 11 shows us an evidence of a new subfamily of toxins, which was named as ?-KTX, and therefore, Ts 11 is the first member of this subfamily: ?-KTx 1. 1. The functional characterization of Ts 9 shows that it has no blocking activity on the tested Kv channels (Kv 1. 1, Kv 1. 2, Kv 1. 3, Kv 1. 4, Kv 1. 5, Kv 1. 6, Kv 2. 1, Kv 3. 1, Kv 4. 2, Kv 7. 2, Kv 10. 1, hERG and Shaker IR) at a concentration of 100 nM. Despite the Ts 9 have not blocked the tested channels, it presents structure and key-amino acid residues that suggest its action on Kvs and previously published study shows that it is a potent <b>ligant</b> for slow conductance calciumactivated potassium channels (SK). It was also conducted a comparative electrophysiological study between the Ts 1 and its precursor isoform Ts 1 -G on voltage gated sodium channels, in order to evaluate the importance of the C-terminal amidation. The mature Ts 1 has amidated C-terminal region, whereas Ts 1 -G isoform is not amidated, and therefore has a Gly at the Cterminal region (last step of post-translational modification, before the action of the enzyme ?-amidante). The Ts 1 -G showed no action on Nav channels at the concentration tested (100 nM), whereas Ts 1 (100 nM) acts as ?-toxin, lowering the excitation threshold of Nav channels and/or reducing sodium currents, evidencing that the C-terminal amidation is important for the biological activity of the mature toxin. Additionally, the analyses by MALDI/TOF of the fractions XIIA and XIIB showed several molecules whose molar masses do not match the toxins already identified, opening prospects for the identification of new molecules with potential biotechnological use, considering that toxins that act on ion channels can be valuable tools for the elucidation of pharmacological, physiological and structural characteristics of their targets...|$|E
40|$|The {{central role}} played by the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) in the correct folding and {{assembly}} of secretary and membrane proteins cannot be overstated. As the first compartment in the secretary pathway, it is responsible for the synthesis, modification and targeting of proteins to their proper destinations within the secretary pathway and the extracellular space. Protein folding in this specialized compartment is dynamic and involves a host of molecular chaperones and folding catalysts. Once inside the ER lumen, proteins fold into their native conformation and undergo a multitude of post-translational modifications, including N-linked glycosylation and disulfide oxidation. The proper conformational maturation of nascent proteins that traverse the secretary pathway is both aided and monitored by a complex process termed ER quality control. A variety of quality control mechanisms that rely on the chaperone systems operate in the ER. These act in close concert with the molecular machinery involved in degradation of non-native proteins to maintain homeostasis. The common goal of these mechanisms is to prevent expression and secretion of misfolded proteins. As a general rule, only those proteins that have successfully completed their folding and passed a stringent selection process are allowed to exit the ER on their way to their final destinations. The importance of the normal functioning of the ER is underlined by the fact that disruption in protein folding, resulting in ER stress, has now been identified as the biochemical basis of many ER storage diseases including Diabetes mellitus, Endocrinopathies and Hemophilia A. Processing events occurring inside the ER lumen are known to influence the efficiency of protein secretion. Vastly different rates of exocytose observed among secretary proteins have been found to correlate with the rate of exit from the ER. One such example is the interesting secretion property exhibited by Retinol Binding Protein (RBP) The principal carrier of retinol (Vitamin A) in plasma. RBP is a single domain protein consisting of three intramolecular disulfide bonds and helps transport retinol from the liver stores to the various target tissues in the body. Availability of its ligand, retinol, while not affecting its synthesis, is known to be the major factor in regulating RBP secretion from the liver. In the absence of retinol, apo-RBP {{has been shown to be}} retained in the ER by a hitherto unclear mechanism. Like most other secretary proteins, RBP is co-translationally targeted to the ER lumen, where it undergoes disulfide oxidation as the only modification. It has been shown to form a complex with another secretary protein, Transthyretin (TTR) in the ER and this complex formation is thought to prevent premature glomerular filtration of the otherwise small RBP with its bound retinol. Despite attaining a mature conformation, apo-RBP is not secreted and awaits conversion to its ligand-bound, holo form in order to exit the ER. It is widely believed that ligand binding may relieve this retention of RBP from the ER quality control machinery. However the precise mechanisms that mediate and regulate RBP folding, ligand binding, TTR assembly and secretion are not clearly understood. Though the folding and secretion properties of RBP have been described in HepG 2 cells, its interactions with the ER resident chaperones have not been addressed. Apart from being an important cell biological question, the study of RBP assumes a lot of significance with its recent emergence as a key player in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It has been proposed that lowering of serum RBP levels could be a new strategy for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. The present study was undertaken with the intention of analyzing the oxidative folding of RBP in the ER more closely. A systematic approach aimed at understanding the early events associated with folding and maturation of RBP, with particular emphasis on the role of ER-resident chaperones and the quality control machinery, is likely to provide interesting insights into the mechanisms involved in its ligand dependent secretion. Reconstitution of RBP biogenesis in a cell free system. The folding of RBP in cells is extremely quick with rapid oxidation kinetics. This makes it difficult to systematically analyze the early folding events in cultured cells. It was necessary to make use of a simplified system that would faithfully recapitulate the folding process in the ER. Therefore, a cell free translation system consisting of rabbit reticulocyte lysate and canine pancreatic microcosms as a source of ER-derived membranes was developed. This system affords the advantage of easy manipulation while still preserving the overall environment that prevails in the ER of intact cells. Extensive biochemical and functional characterization of the isolated microcosms was carried out and in vitro translation and microsomal translocation of RBP was established. Though initially confined to studies on membrane insertion and core glycosylate, the cell free system supplemented with microcosms has subsequently been used to analyze folding and assembly of a number of secretary and membrane proteins. A similar strategy has been adopted in the present study of RBP folding and maturation. Oxidative folding of RBP in isolated microcosms: Delineation of its disulfide oxidation pathway Using glutathione (GSSG) as the oxidant, co- and posttranslational disulfide oxidation of RBP was carried out in isolated microcosms. The ability to manipulate the redox status of this cell free system has helped to considerably slow down the oxidative folding of RBP so that a more careful analysis of the folding process could be performed. RBP was found to undergo oxidative folding with a t 1 / 2 of 30 minutes and folding proceeded through at least one disulfide-bonded intermediate. Non-reducing SDS PAGE was used to resolve the folding intermediates. The pattern of oxidation was in good agreement with that reported earlier in HepG 2 cells. No significant effect of retinol was observed on either the folding kinetics or the pattern of disulfide oxidation of RBP in isolated microsomes. A DTT sensitivity assay, used to probe the conformational maturity of folding RBP, revealed that RBP was capable of maturing into a DTT-resistant conformation in isolated microsomes. With the aid of disulfide mutants, the probable disulfide oxidation pathway of RBP in the ER has been determined. Single and double disulfide mutants of RBP were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and their posttranslational oxidation patterns were analyzed and compared with that of the wild type protein. Based on the results obtained, it was clear that the folding intermediate was made up of one of the two big disulfide loops and that the presence of both these loops was essential for RBP to fold into a fully oxidized, compact form. It has not been possible to determine the contribution of the third, smallest disulfide loop to the oxidative folding of RBP. Molecular events associated with the early oxidative folding of RBP To gain insights into the possible role of ER chaperones in the oxidative folding of RBP, the oligomeric state of folding RBP was analyzed by velocity sedimentation and chemical crosslinking assays. Velocity sedimentation analysis revealed that the reduced form of RBP was present in a large complex of size > 100 S 20,W. Upon disulfide oxidation, it readily dissociated from the complex and assumed a monomeric state. This was evident even during co-translational oxidation which suggested that RBP transiently associated with the large complex during its oxidative folding. Dynamic nature of this complex indicated that this could be a folding complex containing the chaperone machinery of the ER. These results were also supported by crosslinking analysis performed in unbroken microsomes using the homo-bifunctional crosslinker, DSP. The early folding forms of RBP could be crosslinked to a large complex while upon disulfide oxidation, RBP matured to its monomeric form and was no longer crosslinkable. Sedimentation and crosslinking analyses of the RBP disulfide mutants revealed that while the double disulfide mutant remained irreversibly associated with the large complex, the single mutants were released upon acquiring one of the two big disulfide loops. This suggested that despite the lack of one of the two major disulfides, these mutants were considered ‘folded’ by the quality control machinery in the ER while the double mutant probably resembled a molten globule state and was therefore considered ‘unfolded’ and irreversibly retained. Results from crosslinking analysis in microsomes not engaged in active translation suggested that chaperones of the ER were organized in a complex constitutively thereby lending support to the concept of ER-matrix, a large network of luminal proteins consisting of ER chaperones and accessory factors. Given this scenario, it is not unlikely that newly synthesized protein substrates transiently associate with this large pre-existing complex of chaperones and dissociate during late stages of their maturation. Conclusion In all, this study provides significant insights into some of the early events associated with the oxidative folding of RBP in the ER. The delineation of the disulfide oxidation pathway of RBP has been possible. The results obtained from this study suggest that RBP probably dissociates from the quality control quite early during its folding process and this step in its maturation might not be influenced by retinol. The stimulus for its <b>ligant</b> dependent secretion is likely to operate at a later stage of its sojourn in the ER, possibly consequent to positive cues from accessory binding factors such as TTR. Lastly, Perservation of the ER microenvironment in isolated microsomes, as evidenced from this study, augurs well for the use of this system to analyze mechanisms underlying folding, maturation, secretion and/or retention of secretory proteins...|$|E
