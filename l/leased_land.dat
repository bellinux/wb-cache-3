5|$|The DAP also {{focused on}} landholding issues. Chong Chieng Jen, the {{director}} of the DAP's by-election campaign, pointed out that those who decided not to renew their 60-year land leases would have their land returned to the government without compensation, and that even if the government approved requests to have leases renewed, landholders would have to pay large premiums. Chong said that the DAP on the other hand wanted the current state land code to be amended to allow for the automatic and unconditional renewal of all <b>leased</b> <b>land</b> for a period of 99 years.|$|E

5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, {{the south shore}} region of Lake Erie was a popular {{vacation}} destination for the emerging middle class in the United States. The lake's islands, such as Kelleys Island and South Bass Island, were gaining a reputation for their freshwater bathing resorts. The Cedar Point peninsula, named for its abundance of cedar trees, was originally known for its fishing. Local fishermen <b>leased</b> <b>land</b> and built living quarters there. Sandusky, which featured an important shipping harbor and two railroads, transformed into a major economic center {{over the next three}} decades. Railroad and steamship travel supported an emerging tourism industry, and rapid development of the area began.|$|E
5|$|York City <b>leased</b> <b>land</b> at Bootham Crescent from York Cricket Club as a {{replacement}} for their ground at Fulfordgate, which was {{on the outskirts of the}} city. The ground was constructed in four months, and officially opened on 31 August 1932. During the Second World War, the Popular Stand was converted into an air-raid shelter, and the ground suffered slight damage when a bomb landed on houses along the Shipton Street End. York purchased Bootham Crescent for £4,075 in September 1948. Floodlights were fitted at the ground in 1959, and were replaced by ones twice as powerful in 1995. A number of improvements were made in the early 1980s, with a gymnasium, offices and a lounge for officials built.|$|E
5|$|Evins {{incorporated}} Cracker Barrel in February 1970, {{and soon}} opened more locations. In the early 1970s, the firm <b>leased</b> <b>land</b> on gasoline station sites near interstate highways to build restaurants. These early locations all featured gas pumps on-site; during gasoline shortages {{in the mid}} to late 1970s, the firm began to build restaurants without pumps. Into the early 1980s, the company reduced the number of gas stations on-site, eventually phasing them out altogether as the company focused on its restaurant and gift sales revenues. Cracker Barrel became a publicly traded company in 1981 to raise funds for further expansion. It floated {{more than half a million}} shares, raising $4.6 million. Following the initial public offering, Cracker Barrel grew at a rate of around 20percent per year; by 1987, the company had become a chain of more than 50 units in eight states, with annual net sales of almost $81 million.|$|E

5|$|In 1832 the Great Reform Act enfranchised {{those who}} owned or <b>leased</b> <b>land</b> worth £10 {{or more and}} the Second Reform Act {{extended}} this to all householders paying £10 or more in rent per annum, effectively enfranchising the skilled working class, so by 1868 the percentage of voters in Peterborough had risen to about 20% of the population. The Third Reform Act extended {{the provisions of the}} previous act to the counties and the Fourth Reform Act widened suffrage further by abolishing practically all property qualifications for men and by enfranchising women over 30 who met minimum property qualifications. This system, known as universal manhood suffrage, was first used in the 1918 general election. However, full electoral equality wouldn't occur until the Fifth Reform Act ten years later.|$|E

They began selling lots, whether through a good faith belief that US sovereignty superseded Mexican claims, or through deliberate fraud perpetrated on Peralta.|$|E
25|$|Oil {{was known}} to exist here, {{but there was no}} {{practical}} way to extract it. Its main use to that time had been as a medicine for both animals and humans. In the late 1850s Seneca Oil Company (formerly the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company) sent its manager, Colonel Edwin L. Drake, to start drilling on a piece of <b>leased</b> <b>land</b> just south of Titusville, near what is now Oil Creek State Park. Drake hired a salt well driller, William A. Smith, in the summer of 1859. After many difficulties, they finally drilled a commercially successful well on August 27. It was an event that changed the world, beginning with the surrounding vicinity.|$|E
25|$|Although tenants {{produced}} tobacco on many estates, by 1935, 70% of {{the national}} tobacco crop was grown in the Central Region, at first by Africans on Crown land, later by sharecroppers under contract to the holders of <b>leased</b> <b>land</b> for one crop at a time, the “visiting tenant” system. The “visiting tenant” system had some similarities to estate tenancies in the Shire Highlands (called thangata, whether the rent was satisfied in labour or produce), but it was distinct as visiting tenants had permanent homes away from the places where they grew their crop. Like estate tenants, visiting tenants were underpaid for their crop because {{they were forced to}} sell it to the landowner. Although it was originally distinct from thangata, in 1963 shortly before independence, Hastings Banda, as Minister of Agriculture fiercely attacked the visiting tenant system and equated it to the hated thangata. Despite this rhetoric, when thangata was abolished in 1962, a temporary exemption was given for visiting tenants in the Central Region. However, this use represented a further extension of the term thangata.|$|E

His father, Bavajirajsinhji, had succeeded to the throne of Rajkot in 1862, aged six, upon {{the death of his}} own father, Meramanji IV. Rajkot State, {{comprising}} various territories in the interior of Gujarat's Kathiawar peninsula, had been founded in 1611 by Vibhoji (or Vibhaji), a member of the Jadeja clan and a grandson of Sataji, a 16th-century Jam of Nawanagar. Vibhoji had been granted the sanad (authority) to rule the pargana of Sardhar by Jahangir, a Mughal emperor. Although Rajkot was at one time occupied by a force led by a Mughal subedar, the rulers of Rajkot were generally able to maintain their independence. However, from 1808, Rajkot (and most other Kathiawar states) paid tribute to the Gaekwad rulers of Baroda, under the terms of a settlement arranged by Colonel Alexander Walker, the British resident in Baroda. The Walker Settlement largely brought peace to western Gujarat, and in 1820 the British <b>leased</b> <b>land</b> in Rajkot for the purpose of establishing a cantonment.|$|E

500|$|Prior to its interdiction by Solon, Athenians practiced debt enslavement: {{a citizen}} {{incapable}} of paying his debts became [...] "enslaved" [...] to the creditor.

However, this issue primarily concerned those peasants known as [...] "hektēmoroi" [...] working <b>leased</b> <b>land</b> belonging to rich landowners and unable to pay their rents. In theory, those so enslaved would be liberated when their original debts were repaid. The system was developed with variants throughout the Near East and is cited in the Bible.|$|E

500|$|St Anne's-on-the-Sea is {{a planned}} seaside resort on the Fylde coast, {{at the mouth}} of the River Ribble, in Lancashire. It was {{developed}} in the 19th century, largely by the St Anne's Land & Building Company. The company was formed in 1874 and <b>leased</b> <b>land</b> for the new town from the estate of the local Clifton family. Towards the end of the 19th century, pleasure piers became a common feature of English seaside resorts, and by the 1870s there were already two piers in nearby Blackpool (now called North and Central Piers), one in Southport and one [...] away in Lytham. The wording of the land company's original lease indicates that a pier was probably planned for St Anne's from its beginning. A subsidiary, the St Anne's-on-the-Sea Pier and Improvements Company was formed in 1877. The company directors believed that a pier at St Anne's would offer visitors better conditions for fishing and boating than those at neighbouring resorts.|$|E
500|$|In UDL Marine (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. v. Jurong Town Corp. (2011), Lai Swee Lin Linda was {{acknowledged}} {{to be the}} leading authority in Singapore on determining the amenability to judicial review. The High Court said that both the source test and nature test applied in Singapore. In the case, the Jurong Town Corporation ("JTC") had <b>leased</b> <b>land</b> to UDL Marine and had declined to renew the lease after its term expired. UDL Marine challenged this decision. The Court held {{that even though the}} Jurong Town Corporation Act conferred on JTC the power to lease land, it did not prescribe the terms on which JTC could lease land and the considerations to be taken into account. JTC's exercise of power to lease land was a private act as it [...] "was not something a private individual would not be capable of doing". The Court added that even though there was an element of public interest, JTC's decisions had not been [...] "sufficiently of a public nature". In granting and renewing leases, it had been acting just like a private landlord.|$|E
