500|$|In {{the last}} three {{chapters}} Carla, Yolanda and Sandra narrate stories from their childhood surrounded by the extended family, and the girls' relationship with the United States begins. [...] "An American Surprise" [...] tells of their early ideas of New York City, [...] "where it was winter and the snow fell from heaven to earth like the Bible's <b>little</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> manna bread." [...] The reader realizes that the innocence of childhood and idealized vision of their soon-to-be adopted country, given the reverse-chronological narration of How the García Girls Lost Their Accents, are left behind with the García's home in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
500|$|After the {{completion}} of City and Ocean Machine: Biomech, Townsend began to approach a mental breakdown. [...] "I started to see human beings as little lonesome, water based, pink meat," [...] he explained, [...] "life forms pushing air through themselves and making noises that the other <b>little</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> meat seemed to understand." [...] In 1998, he checked himself into a mental-health hospital, where {{he was diagnosed with}} bipolar disorder. The diagnosis helped him understand where the two sides of his music were coming from; he felt his disorder [...] "gave birth to the two extremes that are Strapping's City record and Ocean Machine: Biomech." [...] After being discharged from the hospital, Townsend found that [...] "everything just clicked" [...] {{and he was able to}} write his third solo album, Infinity, which he described as [...] "the parent project" [...] of City and Ocean Machine: Biomech, with music influenced by Broadway. Townsend returned to the studio, accompanied by Hoglan, to work on the album, on which Townsend played most of the instruments. Infinity was released in October 1998. Later in his career, Townsend has cited Infinity as his favorite solo record.|$|E

[...] Made from eight sections of the Berlin Wall, [...] "Breakthrough" [...] not only serves to commemorate the fall of the Berlin Wall, but also to memorialize Churchill's [...] "Sinews of Peace." [...] "I had always wanted to make a sculpture for the Churchill Memorial at Westminster," [...] Sandys said, [...] "and this seemed the perfect moment to do something. [...] Friends in Berlin had come back with tiny <b>little</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> wall, and I thought, ‘Wouldn't it be great to make a sculpture.’ [...] I thought I'd better go straight [...] while there was some wall left." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{common with}} Heaton, Butler and Bayne, Clayton and Bell often robed figures in their windows with dark-coloured cloaks that are dotted with gold stars or flowers. In general practice, a cloak was {{arranged}} {{in such a}} way that it could be cut from fairly large pieces of glass, so that the main folds fell along lead lines and the lesser folds could be applied with paint. But the characteristic [...] "gold-star" [...] decoration of Clayton and Bell necessitated that the entire cloak be divided into <b>little</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> coloured glass, with the gold stars set at the intersections. This created a network of lead which was not necessarily visually desirable. But in practice, the yellow stars catch the eye of the viewer to the extent that the lead disappears. It is another very effective technique for creating a rich and lively appearance, without resorting to heavy over-painting.|$|E
2500|$|Fox Confessor Brings the Flood was {{released}} on March 7, 2006. The album was recorded primarily in Tucson, {{over the course of}} two years as Case worked on the live The Tigers Have Spoken and continued to play with The New Pornographers. Critics hailed the record not only for Case's trademark vocals but also her use of stark imagery and non-standard song structures. Fox Confessor Brings the Flood wound up on many [...] "Best of 2006" [...] lists, such as No.1 on the Amazon.com music editors' picks and No.2 on NPR's All Songs Considered. The album debuted at No.54 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. It contains Case's most autobiographical song, [...] "Hold On, Hold On". Case said: [...] "the song is actually about me. It's not metaphorical about other people. It's not <b>little</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> my life made into a story about someone else or someone fictitious." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album {{features}} {{a variety of}} different musical styles in its tracks. As a testament to the amount of time of production, each song [...] "sounds different from the next," [...] according to Urie. In the beginning, the band had no direction for music or lyrics. However, after returning to the studio and restarting production, the band became excited to start [...] with a second chance. [...] "We've been working on music for {{about a year and a}} half, so I think that partly adds to why some of the songs have some varying styles," [...] Smith said. [...] "Part of it was us, at the beginning, trying to figure out what we wanted to do – we had a new opportunity with just the two of us – and as we sort of got a better hold on what that was, just kind of went from there." [...] The duo picked the best songs out of 30 written as time went on. Urie said the most exciting part of the recording process was [...] "...You get all the work done, record the song, arrange it and then you can add the fun little stuff, <b>little</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> voices and talking and weird instruments you hadn’t used before." [...] The band's musical experimentation stretched as far as employing an iPad to record synthesizers on the record. The band got to work with French band The Plastiscines, and a children's choir on the track [...] "Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met...)" ...|$|E
