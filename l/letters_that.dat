5|$|In his {{lab at the}} Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Nuttin {{designed}} {{experiments to}} test the hypothesis that people place a higher value on <b>letters</b> <b>that</b> feature in their name. It was crucial to the experimental design to rule out other factors, particularly mere exposure. If letters in a name are also <b>letters</b> <b>that</b> occur with higher frequency, then a preference for one's own letters might arise from the mere-exposure effect.|$|E

5|$|Djedkare is well attested in sources {{contemporaneous}} {{with his}} reign. The tombs {{of many of}} his courtiers and family members have been discovered in Giza, Saqqara and Abusir. They give insights into the administrative reforms that Djedkare conducted during his reign and, in a few cases, even record <b>letters</b> <b>that</b> the king sent to his officials. These letters, inscribed on the walls of tombs, typically present royal praises for the tomb owner.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for grapheme-color synesthesia comes {{also from}} the finding that colors can be {{flexibly}} associated to graphemes, as new meanings become assigned to those graphemes. In one study synesthetes were presented with Glagolitic <b>letters</b> <b>that</b> they have never seen before, and the meaning was acquired through a short writing exercise. The Glagolitic graphemes inherited {{the colors of the}} corresponding Latin graphemes as soon as the Glagolitic graphemes acquired the new meaning.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Puerto Escondido, they {{continued}} {{up the coast}} to Loreto, where they restocked their supplies. They then visited the Coronado Islands, Concepcíon Bay and San Lucas Cove, collecting specimens at each stop. The work was exhausting; Steinbeck wrote in his <b>letters</b> <b>that</b> he had little time for sleep because the collecting and preparation took so long. In the cramped quarters of the boat, all the equipment had {{to be set up}} and stowed each time the boat moved to a new anchorage, which made the work of cataloguing and processing the specimens doubly arduous.|$|E

5|$|Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark {{consists}} of twenty-five <b>letters</b> <b>that</b> address an extensive range of contentious political topics, such as prison reform, land rights, and divorce laws, {{as well as}} less controversial subjects, such as gardening, salt works, and sublime vistas. Wollstonecraft's political commentary extends the ideas she had presented in An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution (1794); her discussion of prison reform, for example, is informed by her own experiences in revolutionary France and those of her friends, {{many of whom were}} jailed.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{available}} information relating to the seven lost operas has been deduced from contemporary documents, including the many <b>letters</b> <b>that</b> Monteverdi wrote. These papers provide irrefutable evidence that four of these works—L'Arianna, Andromeda, Proserpina rapita and Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia—were completed and performed in Monteverdi's lifetime, but of their music, only the famous lament from L'Arianna and a trio from Proserpina {{are known to have}} survived. The other three lost operas—Le nozze di Tetide, La finta pazza Licori and Armida abbandonata—were abandoned by Monteverdi before completion; how much of their music was actually written is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people like}} themselves; the {{birthday}} {{is associated with}} the self, and hence the numbers in the birthday are preferred, {{despite the fact that they}} appear in many other contexts. People who do not like themselves tend not to exhibit the birthday-number effect. A similar effect, the name-letter effect, has been found for letters: people tend to prefer the <b>letters</b> <b>that</b> are part of their name. The birthday-number effect and the name-letter effect are significantly correlated. In psychological assessments, the Number Preference Task is used to estimate implicit self-esteem.|$|E

5|$|New Method for Representing by Dots... (1839) {{put forth}} Braille's {{plan for a}} new writing system with which blind people could write <b>letters</b> <b>that</b> could be read by sighted people. Called decapoint, the system {{combined}} his method of dot-punching with a new specialized grill which Braille devised to overlay the paper. When used with an associated number table (also designed by Braille and requiring memorization), the grill could permit a blind writer to faithfully reproduce the standard alphabet.|$|E
5|$|Of {{concern to}} the Home Office were an {{undisclosed}} number of <b>letters</b> <b>that</b> it had received objecting to Colbung's involvement in the repatriation process; it therefore sought assurances from the Australian Government that Colbung was a correct applicant.

ATSIC then convened a meeting in Perth at which it was again resolved that Colbung's application could proceed.|$|E

5|$|Puzzlejuice is a 2012 indie puzzle {{video game}} for iOS {{produced}} and developed by video game company Sirvo. The {{game is a}} combination of Tetris, tile-matching, and Boggle: players rearrange falling tetromino blocks into rows of similar colors, which turn into <b>letters</b> <b>that</b> are cleared from the board by forming words. The fast-paced game also includes challenges and power-ups. The development team consisted three people; programmer Asher Vollmer initially developed the game alone, before reaching out to artist Greg Wohlwend for advice on the aesthetics. Composer Jimmy Hinson produced the game's music.|$|E
5|$|The letter proved prophetic of Chekhov's marital {{arrangements}} with Olga: he lived largely at Yalta, she in Moscow, pursuing her acting career. In 1902, Olga suffered a miscarriage; and Donald Rayfield has offered evidence, {{based on the}} couple's <b>letters,</b> <b>that</b> conception may have occurred when Chekhov and Olga were apart, although Russian scholars have rejected that claim. The literary legacy of this long-distance marriage is a correspondence that preserves gems of theatre history, including shared complaints about Stanislavski's directing methods and Chekhov's advice to Olga about performing in his plays.|$|E

Inspired by this, she returns to her other four best friends and uses a memory spell to remind them of their friendship, cancelling Discord's magic and returning them to normal.|$|E

5|$|Writing systems {{represent}} language using visual symbols, {{which may}} or may not correspond to the sounds of spoken language. The Latin alphabet (and those on which it is based or that have been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of single sounds, so that words were constructed from <b>letters</b> <b>that</b> generally denote a single consonant or vowel in the structure of the word. In syllabic scripts, such as the Inuktitut syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In logographic scripts, each sign represents an entire word, and will generally bear no relation to the sound of that word in spoken language.|$|E
5|$|Another {{burden of}} his {{promotion}} to First Lord of the Admiralty was that St Vincent was inundated with letters from aspiring officers {{and their relatives}} and friends. Soliciting employment from those in positions of influence in the navy had become common practice and was a generally accepted method of securing a good posting. The more influence that an officer could draw upon, the better and often more lucrative the position. Also, due to the peace with France the navy had been reduced and employment was scarce. The First Lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of influence a position and was obliged to reject many of the <b>letters</b> <b>that</b> he received. Despite St Vincent having declared both publicly and privately that officers would be promoted or given position commensurate with their achievements and not based on their political or social influence, the letters continued to flow to the Admiralty.|$|E

In clear water conditions, the upturned hull can be seen reaching to within 5m of the surface. The brass <b>letters</b> <b>that</b> formed Royal Oaks name were removed as a keepsake by a recreational diver in the 1970s. They were returned almost twenty years later, and are now displayed in the Scapa Flow visitor centre in Lyness. Royal Oaks loss is commemorated in an annual ceremony in which Royal Navy divers place the White Ensign underwater at her stern.|$|E
