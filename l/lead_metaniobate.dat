The first and more widely used are single-crystal materials (usually quartz). Though these materials do offer a long life span in terms of sensitivity, their disadvantage is that they are generally less sensitive than some piezoelectric ceramics. The other category, ceramic materials, have a higher piezoelectric constant (sensitivity) than single-crystal materials, and are less expensive to produce. Ceramics use barium titanate, lead-zirconate-lead-titanate, <b>lead</b> <b>metaniobate,</b> and other materials whose composition is considered proprietary by the company responsible for their development. The disadvantage of piezoelectric ceramics, however, is that their sensitivity degrades with time making the longevity of the device less than that of single-crystal materials.|$|E

40|$|Ferroelectric <b>lead</b> <b>metaniobate,</b> PbNb 2 O 6, is a {{piezoelectric}} ceramic typically used {{because of its}} elevated Curie temperature and anisotropic properties. However, the piezoelectric constant, d 33, is relatively low in randomly oriented ceramics {{when compared to other}} ferroelectrics. Crystallographic texturing is often employed to increase the piezoelectric constant because the spontaneous polarization axes of grains are better aligned. In this research, crystallographic textures induced through tape casting are distinguished from textures induced through electrical poling. Texture is described using multiple quantitative approaches utilizing X-ray and neutron time-of-flight diffraction. ^ Tape casting <b>lead</b> <b>metaniobate</b> with an inclusion of acicular template particles induces an orthotropic texture distribution. Templated grain growth from seed particles oriented during casting results in anisotropic grain structures. The degree of preferred orientation is directly linked to the shear behavior of the tape cast slurry. Increases in template concentration, slurry viscosity, and casting velocity lead to larger textures by inducing more particle orientation in the tape casting plane. The maximum 010 texture distributions were two and a half multiples of a random distribution. ^ Ferroelectric texture was induced by electrical poling. Electric poling increases the volume of material oriented with the spontaneous polarization direction in the material. Samples with an initial paraelectric texture exhibit a greater change in the domain volume fraction during electrical poling than randomly oriented ceramics. In tape cast samples, the resulting piezoelectric response is proportional to the 010 texture present prior to poling. This results in property anisotropy dependent on initial texture. Piezoelectric properties measured on the most textured ceramics were similar to those obtained with a commercial standard. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{ferroelectric}} polymorph of <b>lead</b> <b>metaniobate</b> (PbNb 2 O 6) {{presents an}} orthorhombic structure that is metastable at room temperature. This phase is obtained by quenching from high temperature. The fabrication of lead niobate thin films with this orthorhombic form {{has been reported}} to be difficult due to the presence of phases with the rhombohedric form or other non-stoichiometric phases. In this work, lead niobate thin films have been prepared by laser ablation, at different oxygen pressures and with different substrate temperatures. Their structure was studied by X-ray diffraction and their surface was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results show that for low deposition temperatures the films presented a rhombohedric-PbNb 2 O 6 structural phase. As Tdep increases the films started to develop an orthorhombic- PbNb 2 O 6 structure that appeared at 400 ºC and remains up to 600 ºC. For lower oxygen pressure during deposition, a mixture of this phase and other orthorhombic lead deficient phases are present in the films. On the other hand, by increasing the oxygen pressure the lead deficient phases are strongly reduced and the films present only the orthorhombic- PbNb 2 O 6 structure...|$|E
40|$|Oxides {{with the}} tetragonal {{tungsten}} bronze (TTB) structure are well-known ferroelectrics that show a large flexibility both {{with respect to}} chemical composition and cation ordering. Two of the simplest compounds in this family are <b>lead</b> <b>metaniobate</b> (PbNb 2 O 6 or PN) and strontium barium niobate (SrxBa 1 xNb 2 O 6 or SBN). While PN is a classical ferroelectric, SBN goes from ferroelectric to relaxor-like with increasing Sr content, with a polar direction different from that in PN. The partially occupied sublattices in both systems give the possibility for cation order–disorder phenomena, {{but it is not}} known if or how this influences the polarization and ferroelectricity. Here, we use density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate how cation and cation vacancy ordering influences the energetics of these compounds, by comparing both the energy differences and the barriers for transition between different cation configurations. We extend the thermodynamic model of O’Neill and Navrotsky, originally developed for cation interchange in spinels, to describe the order–disorder phenomenology in TTB oxides. The influence of order–disorder processes on the functional properties of PN and SBN is discussed. This is the authors' accepted and refereed manuscript to the article.

40|$|Piezoelectric {{materials}} have wide band gap and no inversion symmetry. Only the orthorhombic phase of <b>lead</b> <b>metaniobate</b> (PbNb 2 O 6) can be ferroelectric and piezoelectric below Curie temperature, {{but not the}} rhombohedral phase. High temperature piezoelectric applications in current decades have revived international interest in orthorhombic PbNb 2 O 6, synthesis of which in pure form is difficult and not well documented. Second problem is that its impedance spectroscopy (IS) data analysis is still incomplete. Present work attempts to fill up these two gaps. Presently found synthesis parameters yield purely orthorhombic PbNb 2 O 6, as checked by X-ray Rietveld analysis and TEM. Present 20 [*]Hz to 5. 5 [*]MHz IS from room temperature to 700 °C shows its ferroelectric Curie temperature {{to be one of}} the highest reported, > 574 °C for 0. 5 [*]kHz and > 580 °C for 5. 5 [*]MHz.

40|$|The elastic, {{dielectric}} and piezoelectric constants of four piezoelectric materials, including polyvinylidene fluoride, vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene copolymer, PZT/epoxy 1 - 3 composite, and <b>lead</b> <b>metaniobate</b> ceramic, {{have been}} evaluated from the impedance data using five different methods. A method described in ANSI/IEEE Std. 176 - 1987, though based on formulae derived for lossless materials, {{is found to be}} applicable to materials with moderate loss. However, for high-loss materials such as polyvinylidene fluoride, the electromechanical coupling constant (k[sub t]) obtained by the method of Std. 176 is substantially higher than the actual value. Calculations based on a piezoelectric resonance analysis program (PRAP) combine the best features of two earlier methods. In addition to the impedance at the parallel resonance frequency, impedances at two other frequencies are required for calculation. The PRAP method gives quite accurate material parameters regardless of the magnitude of the loss, but the parameters (including k[sub t]) vary by as much as 15 % depending on the choice of data. In the nonlinear regression method described in the present work, all the impedance data points around the resonance are least-squares fitted to the theoretical expression for the impedance. Besides the advantage of requiring no arbitrary choice of data, the nonlinear regression method can readily take account of the frequency dependence of the dielectric constant.

40|$|Ferroelectric {{materials}} are {{everywhere in the}} modern society, from consumer electronics to car engines. Applications cover {{a whole range of}} devices such as sensors, actuators and transducers due to their dielectric or piezoelectric properties. Almost all technologically important ferroelectrics have the perovskite crystal structure, and the dominating material is lead zirconate titanate (PZT). In recent years, there has been an increasing desire to develop lead-free alternatives to PZT, although no definite replacement has yet emerged. Exploration of materials with other crystal structures is an attractive route towards finding lead-free alternatives. Ferroelectrics with tetragonal tungsten bronze (TTB) structure have been known for more than 60 years, including <b>lead</b> <b>metaniobate,</b> which is commercially available for high temperature piezoelectric sensor applications. In this work, ferroelectric tungsten bronzes were investigated by combining experiments with first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The principal goal was to obtain a fundamental understanding of the origin of polarization in this class of materials, which is expected to receive more attention in the years to come. A major part of the thesis is focused on the materials strontium barium niobate (SBN) and <b>lead</b> <b>metaniobate</b> (PN). While they both have the TTB structure, they are different in terms of space group symmetry and orientation of polarization with respect to the structural framework. Moreover, the dielectric behaviour of SBN changes with the Sr/Ba ratio, with Ba-rich compositions being classical ferroelectrics and Sr-rich compositions relaxors. Despite the fact that this has been known for decades, the origin of this fundamental difference has so far not been investigated in depth. Both SBN and PN are “unfilled” TTBs, meaning that the structure contains a mixed occupancy of cations and vacancies. This creates a possibility for cation order–disorder phenomena. The energetics of cation ordering in SBN, approximated by the end components, SN and BN, and PN were investigated by first principles calculations, initially with focus on the paraelectric structures. A supercell approach was used to sample ten different possible cation configurations, as an approximation to the true, possibly disordered structure. A thermodynamic model was developed for cation interchange in tungsten bronzes, and this model predicts that cation ordering in the three compositions SN, BN and PN behave qualitatively different as a function of temperature. Importantly, it was concluded that Ba-rich, ferroelectric SBN compositions will probably be more strongly affected by the thermal history than Sr-rich relaxor compositions. The next step in the investigation was the underlying mechanism behind the ferroelectric transition in SBN and PN. First-principles phonon calculations revealed an unstable polar mode in all the ten configurations of both SN and BN. The mode is similar to the soft mode causing spontaneous polarization in perovskite ferroelectrics such as BaTiO 3 and KNbO 3. Some of the configurations were also found to have a second instability, a mode consisting of octahedral tilting in the xy plane of the TTB structure. In contrast to many ferroelectrics, this was not found to reduce the polarization, even for severely distorted structures. The possibilities for octahedral tilting are limited in the rigid TTB structure, and the structural framework cannot completely adapt to the different size of the Sr 2 + and Ba 2 + cations. This leaves Sr 2 + with enough space so that it can displace under the application of an electric field, which is suggested to contribute to the diffuse dielectric response of Sr-rich SBN. In the case of PN, X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments were performed in order to provide reliable data on the ferroelectric crystal structure. Refinement of the cation distribution made it possible to concentrate further first principles calculation on only four relevant cation configurations, for which energies and spontaneous polarization were calculated. The polarization was found to be large and surprisingly robust against cation disorder. Nudged elastic band calculations were performed for the ferroelastic switching in PN, and high transition barriers were found. This is a likely reason why the observed spontaneous polarization in PN is lower than the calculated value. SBN and PN are “unfilled” TTBs with cation–vacancy disorder. A number of “filled” TTBs were also examined computationally, both to isolate the order–disorder effects from other phenomena, and to extend the project to more general TTB materials. The series K 4 R 2 Nb 10 O 30 with R = La,..., Gd, Bi was studied by first-principles phonon calculations, and it was found that while all are subject to the same polar instability as unfilled SBN, the size of the R 3 + cation has a profound effect on an in-plane polar instability similar to the one found in PN. When R = Bi, this instability dominates and results in a net in-plane polarization. Comparison with materials where K is replaced by Tl revealed that the in-plane polarization is closely connected to the presence of lone pair cations on the perovskite-like A 1 sites in the TTB structure. It is suggested that this is the mechanism behind the morphotropic phase boundary in the lead barium niobate system, for which very high piezoelectric response is achieved. TTBs with partially reduced Nb are electrically conducting and have recently been shown to be promising for thermoelectric applications. (Sr, Ba) 6 Nb 10 O 30, the filled counterpart to the ferroelectric SBN system, has an interesting metal–insulator transition as the composition changes from the Ba to the Sr end component. As metallic systems are more challenging for DFT calculations than insulators, attention was given to the choice of functional used for (Sr, Ba) 6 Nb 10 O 30. The DFT+U approach was used, after calibration against computationally much more expensive hybrid functional calculations. Structural optimizations and phonon calculations were then performed, along with an analysis of the electronic structure. Consistent with experiments, filled Ba 6 Nb 10 O 30 was found to be dynamically stable in the tetragonal aristotype symmetry, while filled Sr 6 Nb 10 O 30 has multiple instabilities which lead to an orthorhombic ground state with octahedral tilting and a larger unit cell. The electronic structure calculations were however inconclusive with respect to the metal–insulator transition associated with this structural distortion. The final part of the thesis deals with the rhombohedral polymorph of PN, r- PN. At room temperature, PN is only metastable in the TTB structure, with r-PN being the thermodynamically stable structure. This polymorph has previously been thought to have less interesting properties, with little or no piezoelectric response. The previously reported space group symmetry, R 3 m, is polar, and initial calculations of the spontaneous polarization based on structural data from literature demonstrated a fairly high polarization. A polar–nonpolar phase transition, which could possibly be ferroelectric, was also observed by high-temperature X-ray diffraction, so it was decided to investigate further whether r-PN could have attractive functional properties. X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments were conducted in order to provide a better description of the crystal structure of r-PN at room temperature. This led to a complete re-investigation of the crystal structure, and it was concluded based on experimental and computational investigations that the space group symmetry of r-PN is R 3, and not R 3 m as previously reported. At the same time, the improved description of the crystal structure led to significantly less exciting predictions of spontaneous polarization, and additional dielectric characterization demonstrated that while the material indeed shows a polar–nonpolar phase transition at a high temperature of 780 ◦C, the structural transition has no impact on the dielectric permittivity and the material is not ferroelectric. Finally, this work is a significant contribution to a platform for computational investigation of ferroelectric tungsten bronzes. It has been established that the ferroelectric polarization in the well known SBN system is driven by an unstable phonon similar to what is found in ferroelectric perovskites, and is suggested to be a general feature for most Nb-based TTBs. Only in certain cases, such as when the A 1 site is occupied by a lone pair cation, the out of plane polarization mechanism is suppressed by a different driving force, leading to in-plane polarization...|$|E
