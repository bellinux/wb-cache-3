5|$|The D-21 was {{designed}} to carry a single high-resolution photographic camera over a preprogrammed path, then release the camera module into the air for retrieval, after which the drone would self-destruct. Following a fatal accident when <b>launched</b> <b>from</b> an M-21, the D-21 was modified to be <b>launched</b> <b>from</b> a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress. Several test flights were made, followed by four unsuccessful operational D-21 flights over the People's Republic of China, and the program was canceled in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The {{first four}} Saturn I test flights were <b>launched</b> <b>from</b> LC-34, with only live first stages, {{carrying}} dummy upper stages filled with water. The first flight {{with a live}} S-IV was <b>launched</b> <b>from</b> LC-37. This was followed by five launches of boilerplate CSMs (designated AS-101 through AS-105) into orbit in 1964 and 1965. The last three of these further supported the Apollo program by also carrying Pegasus satellites, which verified {{the safety of the}} translunar environment by measuring the frequency and severity of micrometeorite impacts.|$|E

5|$|Although {{physically}} separate, another facility {{built in}} nearby Roquetoire {{was an integral}} part of the Wizernes complex. Umspannwerk C was built to house a Leitstrahl radio command guidance system which could be used to send course corrections to missiles <b>launched</b> <b>from</b> Wizernes to fine-tune their trajectory during the launch phase.|$|E
5|$|Apollo 7, <b>launched</b> <b>from</b> LC-34 on October 11, 1968, was the C mission, crewed by Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham. It was an 11-day Earth-orbital flight which {{tested the}} CSM systems.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the end of}} Bull Goose test flights, Complex 21 was renovated for the Mace rocket. This {{involved}} {{the addition of the}} second launch rail, and the construction of a concrete structure surrounding the complex. The first Mace <b>launch</b> <b>from</b> LC-21/1 occurred on 11 July 1960. This was followed on 4 December 1962 with the first <b>launch</b> <b>from</b> LC-21/2. LC-21/1 was used for 34 Mace launches, whilst LC-21/2 was used for three. The last <b>launch</b> <b>from</b> rail 2 occurred on 28 June 1963, followed by the final <b>launch</b> <b>from</b> the complex, using rail 21, on 17 July 1963.|$|R
50|$|ULA <b>launches</b> <b>from</b> both {{coasts of}} the United States, {{depending}} on the customer's desired orbit. East coast Atlas V <b>launches</b> take place <b>from</b> <b>Launch</b> Complex 41 while east coast Delta IV <b>launches</b> take place <b>from</b> <b>Launch</b> Complex 37.

5|$|As the air {{campaign}} continued, the Coalition's expectations of an Iraqi offensive decreased. As a result, the United States redeployed the XVIII Airborne Corps and the VII Corps 480kilometers (300mi) to the west. The Coalition's leadership believed that should an Iraqi force go on the offensive, it would be <b>launched</b> <b>from</b> the al-Wafra oil fields, in Southern Kuwait.|$|E
5|$|Components for the Project 26bis2 {{ships were}} {{manufactured}} in the West (Ordzhonikidze built those for Kalinin and Marti those for Kaganovich) and shipped to Komsomolsk-on-Amur for assembly. They were <b>launched</b> <b>from</b> drydocks and towed incomplete to Vladivostok for fitting-out.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{mitigate}} risks, a massive testing program was started. By mid-1954, the first production drawings were issued and wind tunnel work began, along with extensive computer simulation studies carried out both in Canada and the United States using sophisticated computer programs. In a related program, nine instrumented free-flight models were mounted on solid fuel Nike rocket boosters and <b>launched</b> <b>from</b> Point Petre over Lake Ontario while two additional models were <b>launched</b> <b>from</b> the NACA facility at Wallops Island, Virginia, over the Atlantic Ocean. These models were for aerodynamic drag and stability testing, flown {{to a maximum}} speed of Mach 1.7+ before intentionally crashing into the water.|$|E
50|$|The Eastern Range (ER) is an American rocket {{range that}} {{supports}} missile and rocket <b>launches</b> <b>from</b> {{the two major}} launch heads located at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida. The range has also supported Ariane <b>launches</b> <b>from</b> the Guiana Space Centre as well as <b>launches</b> <b>from</b> the Wallops Flight Facility and other lead ranges. The range also uses instrumentation operated by NASA at Wallops and KSC.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the end of}} Bull Goose test flights, Complex 22 was renovated for the Mace rocket. The first Mace <b>launch</b> <b>from</b> LC-22 {{occurred}} on 29 October 1959, with final <b>launch</b> <b>from</b> the complex occurring on 24 June 1960.|$|R

5|$|Navy strikes were <b>launched</b> <b>from</b> the {{aircraft}} carriers of Task Force 77, cruising off the North Vietnamese coast at Yankee Station. Naval aircraft, which had shorter ranges (and carried lighter bomb loads) than their air force counterparts, approached their targets from seaward {{with the majority}} of their strikes flown against coastal targets.|$|E
5|$|On 20 March 2011, USMC AV-8Bs were <b>launched</b> <b>from</b> USS Kearsarge {{in support}} of Operation Odyssey Dawn, {{enforcing}} the UN no-fly zone over Libya.

5|$|A fierce {{defense was}} <b>launched</b> <b>from</b> within the walls, even as Bowie and Travis made {{unsuccessful}} attempts {{to negotiate with}} the Mexican army. Travis repeatedly dispatched couriers with pleas for reinforcements. Although Santa Anna refused to consider a proposed conditional surrender, he extended an offer of amnesty for all Tejanos inside the fortress to walk away unharmed. Most Tejanos evacuated from the fortress about February 25, either as part of the amnesty, or as a part of Juan Segu√≠n's company of courier scouts on their last run.|$|E
5|$|A {{shipyard}} {{was established}} in Faversham by James Pollock & Sons (Shipbuilders) in 1916 {{at the request of}} Lord Fisher, the First Lord of The Admiralty, for manufacturing barges for landing craft. Faversham already had a tradition of shipbuilding, and it soon became a major contributor to markets throughout the world, producing vessels such as the Molliette and the Violette, both constructed of concrete. Over 1200 ships were built and <b>launched</b> <b>from</b> Faversham between 1916 and 1969.|$|E
5|$|A third Saturn IB test, AS-203 <b>launched</b> <b>from</b> pad 37, {{went into}} orbit to support {{design of the}} S-IVB upper stage restart {{capability}} needed for the Saturn V. It carried a nosecone instead of the Apollo spacecraft, and its payload was the unburned liquid hydrogen fuel, the behavior of which engineers measured with temperature and pressure sensors, and a TV camera. This flight occurred on July 5, before AS-202, which was delayed because of problems getting the Apollo spacecraft ready for flight.|$|E
