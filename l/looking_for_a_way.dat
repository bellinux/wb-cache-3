As a {{continuation}} of his Belgian experiments, and especially <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to test wing aerofoils at higher speeds, he contacted Ernest Archdeacon, the co-founder of L'Aero-Club de France, who in turn directed Coandă to Gustav Eiffel and Paul Painlevé. With their assistance, he gained approval to test different wing configurations and air resistance on a platform built by Eiffel at the front of a locomotive on the North of France railway. In March, he started flying lessons at Reims in a Hanriot monoplane.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed, Congress {{repeatedly}} debated the rights of black former slaves freed by the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation and the 1865 Thirteenth Amendment, the latter of which had formally abolished slavery. Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, Republicans grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern States. Because the full population of freed slaves would now be counted for determining congressional representation, rather than the three-fifths previously mandated by the Three-Fifths Compromise, the Southern States would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives, regardless of whether the former slaves were allowed to vote. Republicans began <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to offset this advantage, either by protecting and attracting votes of former slaves, or at least by discouraging their disenfranchisement.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have {{frequently}} noted {{the parallels between}} the three hunting scenes and the three seduction scenes in Gawain. They are generally agreed that the fox chase has significant parallels to the third seduction scene, in which Gawain accepts the girdle from Bertilak's wife. Gawain, like the fox, fears for his life and is <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to avoid death from the Green Knight's axe. Like his counterpart, he resorts to trickery {{in order to save}} his skin. The fox uses tactics so unlike the first two animals, and so unexpectedly, that Bertilak has the hardest time hunting it. Similarly, Gawain finds the Lady's advances in the third seduction scene more unpredictable and challenging to resist than her previous attempts. She changes her evasive language, typical of courtly love relationships, to a more assertive style. Her dress, relatively modest in earlier scenes, is suddenly voluptuous and revealing.|$|E

Meanwhile, Eddy, consumed by paranoia, warns Roman that an unearthly force has been killing off his men, which the former dismisses as nonsense. Nate investigates the chamber but not before he gets separated from Sully via a booby-trapped secret doorway. Unfortunately, Nate and Elena, after deciding to carry on without Sully, find not the statue but Drake's corpse, with whom he sadly leaves the ring (believing he never found the sarcophagus). A group of zombie-like creatures swarm him and his companions, including Eddy and his bodyguard. In the chaos that follows, Eddy and his man are killed. Nate and Elena press on and find themselves in an old Nazi submarine base built into the island. <b>Looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> out, Nate finds a letter written by Drake exposing the truth: El Dorado is protected by a curse that turned both the Spanish colonists and the German soldiers into monsters.
