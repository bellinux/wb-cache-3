5|$|Up {{through the}} 19th century, {{the scope of}} biology was largely divided between medicine, which {{investigated}} questions of form and function (i.e., physiology), and natural history, which was concerned with the diversity of <b>life</b> <b>and</b> interactions among different forms of <b>life</b> <b>and</b> between <b>life</b> <b>and</b> non-life. By 1900, much of these domains overlapped, while natural history (and its counterpart natural philosophy) had largely given way to more specialized scientific disciplines—cytology, bacteriology, morphology, embryology, geography, and geology.|$|E
