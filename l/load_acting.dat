40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{determine}} the <b>loads</b> <b>acting</b> on the cutterhead of a compound shield, this paper aims at the large-scale and fully coupled system of the excavation face. Firstly, a new model is proposed to calculate the <b>loads</b> <b>acting</b> on a single cutter, in which the earth pressure of the chamber is taken into consideration. Then, by transforming the large-scale nonlinear contact problem into a smaller one, we set up the governing equations only including the penetration depth of cutters in the approach of the sub-structure condensation, to calculate the <b>loads</b> <b>acting</b> on the cutterhead. Finally, the relationship between the penetration per revolution and the total thrust and total torque acting on the cutters of the cutterhead of a compound shield is investigated...|$|R

Under a vertical load, a case where the cylinder takes on the full load, the precision of the cylinder is affected the most. A study at the National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan, concluded that the accuracy is about ± 30 nm, which is still within a satisfactory range but shows that the compressibility of air has an effect on the system.|$|E

5000|$|Wind <b>load</b> <b>acting</b> on the {{building}} {{is the result of}} wind blowing on {{the building}}. This wind pressure must be resisted by the curtain wall system since it envelops and protects the building. Wind loads vary greatly throughout the world, with the largest wind loads being near the coast in hurricane-prone regions. For each project location, building codes specify the required design wind loads. Often, a wind tunnel study is performed on large or unusually shaped buildings. A scale model of the building and the surrounding vicinity is built and placed in a wind tunnel to determine the wind pressures acting on the structure in question. These studies take into account vortex shedding around corners and the effects of surrounding area ...|$|E
50|$|The {{passage of}} the {{earthquake}} waves through the rock and soil produces {{a complex set of}} accelerations that effectively act to change the gravitational load on the slope. So, for example, vertical accelerations successively increase and decrease the normal <b>load</b> <b>acting</b> on the slope. Similarly, horizontal accelerations induce a shearing force due to the inertia of the landslide mass during the accelerations. These processes are complex, but can be sufficient to induce failure of the slope. These processes can be much more serious in mountainous areas in which the seismic waves interact with the terrain to produce increases in the magnitude of the ground accelerations. This process is termed 'topographic amplification'. The maximum acceleration is usually seen at the crest of the slope or along the ridge line, meaning that it is a characteristic of seismically triggered landslides that they extend {{to the top of the}} slope.|$|E
5000|$|Piston {{rings are}} subject to wear as they {{move up and down}} the {{cylinder}} bore due to their own inherent load and due to the gas <b>load</b> <b>acting</b> on the ring. To minimize this, they are made of wear-resistant materials, such as cast iron and steel, and are coated or treated to enhance the wear resistance. Two-stroke port design is critical to ring life. Newer modern motorcycle manufacturers have many single function but serrated ports to retain the ring. Typically, top ring and oil control rings will be coated with chromium, or Nitrided, possibly plasma sprayed [...] or have a PVD (physical vapour deposition) ceramic coating. For enhanced scuff resistance and further improved wear, most modern diesel engines have top rings coated with a modified chromium coating known as CKS or GDC, a patent coating from Goetze which has aluminium oxide or diamond particles respectively included in the chrome surface. The lower oil control ring is designed to leave a lubricating oil film, a few micrometres thick on the bore, as the piston descends. Three piece oil rings, i.e. with two rails and one spacer, are used for four-stroke gasoline engines.|$|E

50|$|Strain gauge {{load cells}} convert the <b>load</b> <b>acting</b> on them into {{electrical}} signals. The gauges themselves are bonded onto a beam or structural member that deforms when weight is applied. In most cases, four strain gauges {{are used to}} obtain maximum sensitivity and temperature compensation. Two of the gauges are usually in tension can be represented as T1 and T2,and two in compression can be represented as C1 and C2, and are wired with compensation adjustments. The strain gauge load cell is fundamentally a spring optimized for strain measurement. Gauges are mounted in areas that exhibit strain in compression or tension. When weight {{is applied to the}} load cell, gauges C1 and C2 compress decreasing their resistances. Simultaneously, gauges T1 and T2 are stretched increasing their resistances. The change in resistances causes more current to flow through C1 and C2 and less current to flow through T1 and T2. Thus a potential difference is felt between the output or signal leads of the load cell. The gauges are mounted in a differential bridge to enhance measurement accuracy. When weight is applied, the strain changes the electrical resistance of the gauges in proportion to the load. Other load cells are fading into obscurity, as strain gauge load cells continue to increase their accuracy and lower their unit costs.|$|E

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the <b>load</b> <b>acting</b> on a tunnel support is of fundamental importance for the correct dimensioning of the structure when analytical calculation methods are used. The <b>load</b> <b>acting</b> on the support depends on various factors {{and for this reason}} its evaluation can appear somewhat complex. One way of evaluating the <b>load</b> <b>acting</b> on a support is to use the convergence-confinement method. This process involves intersecting the convergence-confinement curve with the support reaction line. However, {{in order to be able}} to adopt this technique, it is necessary to know the radial displacement of the tunnel wall at the point in which the support is to be installed. A technique for the {{evaluation of}} the <b>load</b> <b>acting</b> on a support is presented in this study. This technique is based on the convergence-confinement method and on the Vlachopoulos and Diederichs formulation for the estimation of the radial displacement of the tunnel wall at the point in which the support is to be installed. An iterative procedure has been introduced in order to obtain a final {{evaluation of the}} <b>load</b> <b>acting</b> on the support. Application of the procedure to over 1700 representative cases of the typical conditions that can be encountered during excavation of a tunnel in rock masses has made it possible to obtain graphs that illustrate the <b>load</b> <b>acting</b> on the support for variations of the in situ lithostatic stress. An analysis of the results has led to considerations on the factors that influence the <b>load</b> <b>acting</b> on the support and has made it possible to identify which factors are of greatest influence and those that can be considered negligibl...|$|E
