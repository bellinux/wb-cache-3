500|$|Cannon first {{played for}} the LSU varsity {{football}} team as a sophomore in 1957 under coach Paul Dietzel. He played in the halfback position and shared the backfield with Jim Taylor, who was selected as an All-American that year. He also played defensive back and was the team's primary punter. He quickly emerged as a star, scoring twice in early season victories over Alabama and Texas Tech. The Alabama game was the most prolific rushing game of Cannon's college career; he amassed 140 yards with eight carries. Against the Red Raiders, Cannon had five punts for a 40-yard average, completed two of four passes for 31 yards, caught a 59-yard pass for a touchdown, carried thirteen times for 36 yards, and returned a kickoff for a touchdown. Cannon recalled that Texas Tech's focus was solely on Taylor. [...] "They were just wearing Jimmy out", he said. [...] "Of course, they weren't <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> They just beat the devil out of Jimmy. With them focusing on Jimmy, I had a great game." [...] Over half a century later, former Red Raiders standout Jack Henry recalled of Cannon:"We kicked off. And that damn Billy Cannon. Jim Henderson and I were running down in our lanes and got down there, {{and we were going}} to hit him high and low. We were going to knock the hell out of him... We hit ourselves. Ran into each other. He made a 100-yard touchdown. You don't forget that." ...|$|E

He said, [...] "I used to stand outside the theater knowing the truant officer was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I would stand there 'til someone came along, and then ask them to buy my ticket. It was necessary for an adult to accompany a juvenile into the theater. When I succeeded I'd give him my ten cents—that's all it cost—and I'd go {{up to the top of}} the balcony where I'd put my chin on the rail and watch, spellbound, from the first act to the last. I would usually select the actor I liked the most and follow his performance throughout the play." ...|$|E

2500|$|The aerial {{campaign}} for Singapore {{began at the}} outset of the invasion of Malaya. Early on 8 December 1941, Singapore was bombed for the first time by long-range Japanese aircraft, such as the Mitsubishi G3M2 [...] "Nell" [...] and the Mitsubishi G4M1 [...] "Betty", based in Japanese-occupied Indochina. The bombers struck the city centre as well as the Sembawang Naval Base and the island's northern airfields. After this first raid, throughout the rest of December, there were a number of false alerts and several infrequent and sporadic hit-and-run attacks on outlying military installations such as the Naval Base, but no actual raids on Singapore City. The situation had become so desperate, that one British soldier took to the middle of a road to fire his Vickers machine gun at any aircraft that passed. He could only say: [...] "The bloody bastards will never think of <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> in the open, and I want to see a bloody plane brought down." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Mark Crispin Miller, Graceland became for Presley [...] "the {{home of the}} {{organization}} that was himself, was tended by a large vague clan of Presleys and deputy Presleys, each squandering the vast gratuities which Elvis used to keep his whole world smiling." [...] The author adds that Presley's father Vernon [...] "had a swimming pool in his bedroom", that there [...] "was a jukebox next to the swimming pool, containing Elvis' favorite records" [...] and that the singer himself [...] "would spend hours in his bedroom, watching his property on a closed-circuit television." [...] According to the singer's cousin, Billy Smith, Presley {{spent the night at}} Graceland with Smith and his wife Jo many times: [...] "we were all three there talking for hours about everything in the world! Sometimes he would have a bad dream and come <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to talk to, and he would actually fall asleep in our bed with us." [...] Priscilla Beaulieu also lived at Graceland for five years before she and Elvis wed in Las Vegas, Nevada, on May 1, 1967. Their daughter Lisa Marie Presley was born on February 1, 1968, and spent the first years of her life on the estate until her parents divorced in 1972, and she moved to California with her mother. Every year around Christmas, Lisa Marie Presley and all her family would go to Graceland to celebrate Christmas together. Lisa Marie often goes back to Graceland for visits.|$|E
