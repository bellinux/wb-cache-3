40|$|Cell {{membrane}} {{changes its}} morphology during many physiological processes {{with the assistance}} of a solid support, such as the cytoskeleton, under an environmental stimulus. Here, a novel type of stimuli-responsive <b>lipogel</b> was fabricated, mimicking the changes of cell membrane. The <b>lipogel</b> was prepared from poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM) microgel particle and phospholipid by a solvent-exchange method. The temperature dependent volume phase transition of pNIPAM triggers reversible transformation of the <b>lipogel</b> between a lipid vesicle-coated sun-like structure and a contracted hybrid sphere, through lipid merging and protrusion processes, respectively. By contrast, the salt induced pNIPAM phase transition leads to an irreversible vesicle release behaviour. The <b>lipogel</b> creates a unique platform for studying cell membrane behaviour and provides promising candidates in drug delivery and controlled release applications. © 2014 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Background : Cold {{injuries}} {{represent a}} serious problem in winter sport practice and other outdoor activities. Some protection {{is expected to be}} achieved by specific topical preparations aiming at decreasing heat loss by water evaporation from the skin. Objective : To compare the efficacy of 6 topical formulations enriched or not in rubefacients. The role of the vehicle was also assessed. Methods : A total of 30 trained cyclists tested the products on their forearms. The skin temperature and electrometric values were recorded at baseline following applications of the test products, and after 30 min-bicycle riding in moderately cold and humid outdoor conditions. Results : At baseline, skin temperature was increased by rubefacients dispersed a <b>lipogel</b> and o/w emulsion. This parameter decreased at all test sites after riding, but the values remained higher at the rubefacient-treated sites compared to the control untreated site. The oil and <b>lipogel</b> formulations achieved partial occlusion decreasing the transepidermal water loss. This effect was maintained after exercise without, however, hindering sweating. Conclusion : Among the presently tested formulations, the rubefacient-enriched lipogels appeared to be the most efficient formulations for maintaining skin temperature in the normal range during sport practice in a moderately cold environment...|$|E
40|$|Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) plays {{a crucial}} role in the {{pathogenesis}} of skin fibrotic diseases. Systemic TGF-beta inhibitors effectively inhibit fibrosis in different animal models; however, systemic inhibition of TGF-beta raises important safety issues because of the pleiotropic physiological effects of this factor. In this study, we have investigated whether topical application of P 144 (a peptide inhibitor of TGF-beta 1) ameliorates skin fibrosis in a well-characterized model of human scleroderma. C 3 H mice received daily subcutaneous injections of bleomycin for 4 wk, and were treated daily with either a <b>lipogel</b> containing P 144 or control vehicle. Topical application of P 144 significantly reduced skin fibrosis and soluble collagen content. Most importantly, in mice with established fibrosis, topical treatment with P 144 <b>lipogel</b> for 2 wk significantly decreased skin fibrosis and soluble collagen content. Immunohistochemical studies in P 144 -treated mice revealed a remarkable suppression of connective tissue growth factor expression, fibroblast SMAD 2 / 3 phosphorylation, and alpha-smooth muscle actin positive myofibroblast development, whereas mast cell and mononuclear cell infiltration was not modified. These data suggest that topical application of P 144, a peptide inhibitor of TGF-beta 1, is a feasible strategy to treat pathological skin scarring and skin fibrotic diseases for which there is no specific therapy...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lipogels</b> were {{prepared}} by dispersing mixed (60 : 40 C(16) -C(18)) and pure (C(18)) homologue magnesium stearate (MgSt) in liquid paraffin, using three methods of preparation, i. e. addition {{of water at}} 95 degrees C during cooling cycle (method 1), homogenisation upon cooling (method 2) or cooling without addition of water or homogenisation (method 3). The systems were characterised by physical inspection, polarised, hot stage and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), rheology, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Systems formed stable semisolid <b>lipogels</b> (no syneresis), unstable solids showing syneresis or structured fluids, {{depending on the type}} of magnesium stearate used and the preparation technique. The stable semisolid <b>lipogels</b> containing mixed homologue MgSt (commercial-as received, anhydrous or dihydrate) prepared by methods 1 (similar to 1 - 2 % water) and 2 contained alpha-crystalline lamellar structure. These were not present in the unstable solids formed with method 3 or in systems prepared from pure homologue MgSt which were generally structured fluids rather than semisolids. In addition, semisolid <b>lipogels</b> of pure homologue trihydrate MgSt prepared by method 3 showed plate-like crystals, implying pressure sensitivity. There is significantly more amorphous MgSt in the unstable solids compared to the stable semisolid <b>lipogels,</b> which are mainly crystalline (confirmed by XRD) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} different dosage forms, emulsions, emulgels, <b>lipogels,</b> and thickened microemulsion-based hydrogel, as fluconazole topical delivery systems {{with the purpose}} of determining a formulation with the capacity to deliver the whole active compound and maintain it within the skin so as to be considered a useful formulation either for topical mycosis treatment or as adjuvant in a combined therapy for Cutaneous Leishmaniasis. Propylene glycol and diethyleneglycol monoethyl ether were used for each dosage form as solvent for the drug and also as penetration enhancers. In vitro drug release after application of a clinically relevant dose of each formulation was evaluated and then microemulsions and <b>lipogels</b> were selected for the in vitro penetration and permeation study. Membranes of mixed cellulose esters and full-thickness pig ear skin were used for the in vitro studies. Candida albicans was used to test antifungal activity. A microemulsion containing diethyleneglycol monoethyl ether was found to be the optimum formulation as it was able to deliver the whole contained dose and enhance its skin penetration. Also this microemulsion showed the best performance in the antifungal activity test compared with the one containing propylene glycol. These results are according to previous reports of the advantages of microemulsions for topical administration and they are very promising for further clinical evaluation...|$|R

The considerable differences in rheological characteristics produced significant differences on in vitro drug release tests, whereas a lesser influence was observed on in vitro simulated absorption test. The rheological differences appeared not to influence in vivo drug availability. Also, rheological differences owing to the concentration of the gelling agent showed no significant influence on in vivo availability...|$|R
40|$|The controlled, site {{specific}} {{delivery of}} therapeutic agents in a minimally invasive manner is {{an approach that}} aims to reduce off-target effects and enhance overall efficacy {{for a variety of}} disease states. Conversely, the manifestation of off-target effects is correlated with concentrations of therapeutic agents in healthy tissue. These principles have been acknowledged by researchers for a considerable period of time. However, the vast majority of drug and cell delivery is still performed in arguably a suboptimal fashion, which fails to fully exploit these concepts. An alternative is the use of biomaterials for site specific delivery, to enable longer retention of therapeutic agents within the target tissue. The overall aim of this research was to investigate the use of a number of biomaterials for the controlled delivery of regenerative therapeutics to the heart as on-demand treatment options for tissue damage accrued {{as a result of a}} myocardial infarction. These materials were Chitosan/β-Glycerophosphate (GP) thermoresponsive hydrogels loaded with thermosensitive liposomes for the controlled release of pro-angiogenic small molecule drugs (Chapter 2 and Chapter 3). Collagen cardiac patches loaded with alginate microparticles for the controlled release of pro-angiogenic growth factors (Chapter 4). In addition, a cardiac pocket that can enhance retention and enable minimally invasive replenishments of stem cells and small molecule therapeutics within the heart, in a site-specific manner. In Chapter 2, chitosan/β-GP hydrogels were combined with Lysolipid Thermosensitive Liposomes (LTSLs) loaded with the pro-angiogenic small-molecule drug, desferrioxamine (DFO). This formulation (denoted <b>Lipogel)</b> is conceived as an on-demand drug delivery platform that can be injected into the heart in a minimally invasive manner. We demonstrate that <b>Lipogel</b> can provide scheduled release of DFO from the LTSLs in response to a mild hyperthermic stimulus. This formulation demonstrates enhanced retention of DFO within the hydrogel for an extended period of time. <b>Lipogel</b> can be activated and resulting DFO release can provide a dose-responsive increase in the pro-angiogenic cytokine Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). The flexibility of the <b>Lipogel</b> formulation to provide a variety of release kinetics was investigated in Chapter 3. It was possible to tune the release kinetics of different drugs independently by free loading one therapeutic agent within the gel and activating a second LTSL encapsulated agent via a hyperthermic stimulus. In addition, it was possible to modify the drug dosage within <b>lipogel</b> by varying the duration of hyperthermia. This can allow for adaption of drug dosing in real time. Chapter 4 investigated the potential of a collagen based epicardial patch loaded with alginate microparticles containing both HGF and IGF- 1 (denoted CardioColl) to promote the recruitment and expansion of endogenous cardiac stem cells. Release of both growth factors could be extended and was shown to enhance the response of stem cells resident within the heart. Chapter 5 investigated a biocompatible pocket (denoted Thericardium) that can be placed around the heart to enhance retention and permit minimally invasive replenishments of cell therapy and small molecule therapy to the heart. This cardiac pocket enhanced cell retention in the myocardium 24 hours after infarction. In addition, cells could be replenished through an access port 96 hours after infarction and cell retention was enhanced 10 fold. This could also be achieved with a model small molecule drug, enhancing retention 50 fold 96 hours after infarction. In addition, a scaled up pocket for use on a porcine heart permitted the site specific delivery of small molecules to the heart. Collectively, the research presented in this thesis has demonstrated that a number of biomaterials demonstrate a unique potential and flexibility to deliver a variety of therapeutic agents. <b>Lipogel</b> demonstrates remarkable flexibility in terms of drug scheduling and sequencing, this cohesion and controlled release could enable significant enhancements in efficacy and safety. CardioColl represents a novel treatment option to regenerate damaged myocardium. The patch is envisaged as an off-the-shelf option, which would activate stem cell compartments resident in the heart. Finally, the potential for localised delivery with TheriCardium is vast. This cardiac pocket enhances retention of cells and small molecules and can permit their replenishment in a minimally invasive, site-specific manner...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Metronidazole is {{the drug}} of choice in the {{treatment}} of periodontal pockets up to 5 mm in depth. It is topically applied - directly into the periodontal pockets. There are no registred trademark preparations for this purpose in the market of Serbia and Montenegro. The aim of our latest research was to test the efficacy of newly formulated preparation containing 25 % metronidazole suspended in a <b>lipogel</b> in vitro - in anaerobic cultures isolated from the periodontal pockets, and in vivo - by the direct application into periodontal pockets. Methods. Preparation efficacy was tested in a randomized controlled study involving 25 patients, and was confirmed by the membrane-free agar diffusion method on the anaerobic strains isolated from the periodontal pockets. The duration of the testing was 30 days. The preparation was applied twice - immediately after the taking of the first swab, and on day 15, when the control swab was taken for the assessment {{of the effects of the}} applied preparation. Results. Seven anaerobic strains were isolated and tested, and each was confirmed as highly susceptible to metronidazole. Anaerobic strains were not isolated in any of the pockets treated with metronidazole-containing <b>lipogel.</b> The strains isolated in the control pockets were the same as were those at the beginning of the study. Conclusion. Metronidazole, in a lipogel-type base applied in the concentration of 25 %, provided an efficient treatment of anaerobic infection in the periodontal pockets...|$|E
40|$|Lysolipid-based thermosensitive liposomes (LTSL) {{embedded}} in a chitosan-based thermoresponsive hydrogel matrix (denoted <b>Lipogel)</b> represents a novel approach for the spatiotemporal release of therapeutic agents. The entrapment of drug-loaded liposomes in an injectable hydrogel permits local liposome retention, thus providing a prolonged release in target tissues. Moreover, release can be controlled {{through the use of}} a minimally invasive external hyperthermic stimulus. Temporal control of release is particularly important for complex multi-step physiological processes, such as angiogenesis, in which different signals are required at different times in order to produce a robust vasculature. In the present work, we demonstrate the ability of <b>Lipogel</b> to provide a flexible, easily modifiable release platform. It is possible to tune the release kinetics of different drugs providing a passive release of one therapeutic agent loaded within the gel and activating the release of a second LTSL encapsulated agent via a hyperthermic stimulus. In addition, it was possible to modify the drug dosage within <b>Lipogel</b> by varying the duration of hyperthermia. This can allow for adaption of drug dosing in real time. As an in vitro proof of concept with this system, we investigated Lipogels ability to recruit stem cells and then elevate their production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by controlling the release of a pro-angiogenic drug, desferroxamine (DFO) with an external hyperthermic stimulus. Initial cell recruitment was accomplished by the passive release of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) from the hydrogel, inducing a migratory response in cells, followed by the delayed release of DFO from thermosensitive liposomes, resulting in a significant increase in VEGF expression. This delayed release could be controlled up to 14  days. Moreover, by changing the duration of the hyperthermic pulse, a fine control over the amount of DFO released was achieved. The ability to trigger the release of therapeutic agents at a specific timepoint and control dosing level through changes in duration of hyperthermia enables sequential multi-dose profiles. Statement of Significance This paper details the development of a heat responsive liposome loaded hydrogel for the controlled release of pro-angiogenic therapeutics. Lysolipid-based thermosensitive liposomes (LTSLs) {{embedded in}} a chitosan-based thermoresponsive hydrogel matrix represents a novel approach for the spatiotemporal release of therapeutic agents. This hydrogel platform demonstrates remarkable flexibility in terms of drug scheduling and sequencing, enabling the release of multiple agents and the ability to control drug dosing in a minimally invasive fashion. The possibility to tune the release kinetics of different drugs independently represents an innovative platform to utilise for a variety of treatments. This approach allows a significant degree of flexibility in achieving a desired release profile via a minimally invasive stimulus, enabling treatments to be tuned in response to changing symptoms and complications...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn 80 -membered {{library of}} gels {{composed}} of monofunctional 2 -ethyl- 2 -oxazoline and 2 -nonyl- 2 -oxazoline {{and one of}} four selected difunctional 2 -oxazolines (containing either ether or ester bonds) were synthesized by microwave-assisted ring-opening polymerizations. The difunctional 2 -oxazolines were prepared from the thiol-ene reaction of glycol dimercaptoacetate or 2, 2 ′-(ethylenedioxy) diethanethiol and 2 -but- 3 ′-enyl- 2 -oxazoline or 2 -dec- 9 ′-enyl- 2 -oxazoline. 53 of the gels exhibited glass-transition temperatures, which ranged from − 5. 9 to 45. 3 °C. 13 Derivatives exhibited glass-transition temperatures {{in the range from}} 20 to 30 °C, which renders them stiff at room temperature and flexible at body temperature. The gels that did not contain any 2 -ethyl- 2 -oxazoline acted as <b>lipogels,</b> whereas the gels that did not contain any 2 -nonyl- 2 -oxazoline acted as hydrogels; all other gels may be classified as amphigels. The swelling degrees were measured by gravimetry and maximum swelling degrees of 6 (in water) were observed for the gels with the lowest degrees of crosslinking. In a second approach, the synthesis of crosslinked networks had been achieved by performing the polymeranalogous thiol-ene reaction of copoly(2 -oxazoline) s containing olefinic side-chains and glycol dimercaptoacetate. This soft strategy enabled the straightforward loading of such gels with active pharmaceutical ingredients without altering them. This method delivered gels with selected composition exhibiting a targeted disc-shape and loaded with active pharmaceutical ingredients from one-step syntheses. The maximum swelling degrees of these specimens were found to be in accordance with the ones from the first route investigated. Preliminary degradation studies were performed at 25 °C; these types of gels were found to be degraded in alkaline media as well as by esterases...|$|R
40|$|Background Hypertrophic scars {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} complications in surgery due to their cos-metic and functional impairments.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the vehicle on the release and permeation of fluconazole, a topical antifungal drug dissolved in Jojoba oil was evaluated. Series of Cutina lipogels (Cutina CPA [cetyl palmitate], CBS [mixture of glyceryl stearate, cetearyl alcohol, cetyl palmitate, and cocoglycerides], MD [glyceryl stearate], and GMS [glyceryl monostearate]) in different concentrations as well as gel microemulsion were prepared. In-vitro drug release in Sorensens citrate buffer (pH 5. 5) and permeation through the excised skin of hairless mice, using a modified Franz diffusion cell, were performed. The rheological behavior and the apparent viscosity values for different gel bases were measured before and after storage under freezing conditions at − 4 °C and were taken as measures for stability of network structure. Candida albicans {{was used as a}} model fungus to evaluate the antifungal activity of the best formula achieved. The results of in vitro drug release and its percutaneous absorption showed that the highest values from gel microemulsion were assured. The rheological behavior of the prepared systems showed pseudoplastic (shear-thinning) flow indicating structural breakdown of the existing intermolecular interactions between polymeric chains. Moreover, the stability study revealed no significant difference between viscosity before and after storage for different formulae except for CPA Cutina <b>lipogel</b> (using analysis of variance [ANOVA] test at level of significance. 05). The antifungal activity of fluconazole showed the widest zone of inhibition with gel microemulsion. The gel microemulsion is an excellent vehicle for fluconazole topical drug delivery...|$|E

40|$|Here {{we report}} a {{composite}} {{system based on}} fibrin hydrogels that incorporate in their structure near-infrared (NIR) responsive nanomaterials and thermosensitive liposomes (TSL). Polymerized fibrin networks entrap simultaneously gold-based nanoparticles (NPs) capable of transducing NIR photon energy into heat, and lysolipid-incorporated TSL (LTSL) loaded with doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX). NIR irradiation of the resulting hydrogels (referred to as "lipogels") with 808. nm laser light increased {{the temperature of the}} illuminated areas, leading to the release of the liposomal cargo. Levels of DOX that release from the "smart" composites were dependent on the concentration of NIR nanotransducers loaded in the <b>lipogel,</b> the intensity of the electromagnetic energy deposited and the irradiation regime. Released DOX retained its bioactivity, as shown in cultures of epithelial carcinoma cells. Finally, the developed drug delivery platform was refined by using NIR-photoabsorbers based on copper sulfide NPs to generate completely biodegradable composites as well as through the incorporation of cholesterol (Ch) in LTSL formulation, which lessens leakiness of the liposomal cargo at physiological temperature. This remotely controlled system may suit well for those therapies that require precise control over the dose of delivered drug in a defined spatiotemporal framework. Statement of Significance: Hydrogels composed of fibrin embedding nanoparticles responsive to near infrared (NIR) energy and thermosensitive liposomes loaded with doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX), were prepared by in situ polymerization. NIR-light irradiation of these constructs, referred to as "NIR responsive lipogels", results in the controlled release of DOX to the surrounding medium. This technology may use fully degradable components and can preserve the bioactivity of liposomal cargo after remote triggering to finely regulate the dose and bioavailability of delivered payloads. NIR responsive lipogels technology overcomes the limitations of drug release systems based on the combination of liposomes and degradable polymeric materials, which in many cases lead to insufficient release at therapy onset or to overdose during high degradation period...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to design a test to {{ascertain}} the behaviour and reliability of a membrane used in drug release and simulated absorption tests in order to arrive at useful indications for simulating topical as well as gastro-intestinal absorption. The membrane can be used in two different conditions: a) as a simple porous membrane placed between the ointment and an accepting liquid phase, generally water phase; b) as a membrane soaked in a lipophilic liquid phase to simulate the horny layer between the ointment and accepting water phase. In this study the "bubble point test” was used to test the integrity of the soaking film as well as the membrane, during and after drug release and simulated absorption tests with different types of ointment. In the case of a drug release test from an ointment, the bubble point test may determine the test conditions, that is the ointment applied to either a dry or hydrated membrane. Only use of a previously hydrated membrane can guarantee constant conditions in the in vitro model. Use of a dry membrane may lead to infiltration of liquid components of the ointment base, thus altering the contact conditions between the two phases of the cutaneous compartment model (<b>lipogel</b> and A/O creams). The use of a hydrated membrane may also lead to interactions between the two phases of the compartment, with osmotic exchanges between the acceptor phase and ointment sample (hydrogel, PEG gel, O/A creams). The hydrated membrane is therefore reliable only for comparison between lipophilic base ointments. In a simulated absorption test, determination of the bubble point makes it possible to ascertain the physical integrity of the lipoid liquid film immobilized by capillary action in the inner microporous structure of the membrane during the test. This condition is essential to maintain a balance between the parameters regulating the diffusion process between the different compartments of the system. The use of a lipoid-soaked membrane makes it possible to avoid interactions between the ointment sample and aqueous acceptor phase, such as hydrosoluble bases. Since the diffusion across a lipoid film immobilised within a porous membrane depends on the drug release rate from the ointment base, the test allows a contextual evaluation of the release kinetics as well as an indication of the drug absorption possibilities through an in vitro model of the cutaneous compartment...|$|E
