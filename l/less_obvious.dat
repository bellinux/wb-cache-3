5|$|Admitting {{that plants}} {{generally}} have <b>less</b> <b>obvious</b> evidence of 'a designed and studied mechanism' than animals, still Paley adds some examples, {{as of the}} parts of the seed, the delicate germ being protected by a tough or spiny husk, and dispersed by wings or other appendages.|$|E
5|$|Adult terns may be hunted by owls and raptors, {{and their}} chicks and eggs {{may be taken}} by herons, crows or gulls. <b>Less</b> <b>obvious</b> nest predators include ruddy turnstones in the Arctic, and gull-billed terns in little tern colonies. Adults may be robbed of their catch by avian kleptoparasites such as frigatebirds, skuas, other terns or large gulls.|$|E
5|$|Some {{characteristics}} of the mushroom-forming genera (marked with * below) can be <b>less</b> <b>obvious</b> or absent in tropical species. Distinguishing between Lactarius and Lactifluus based on morphology alone is quite difficult, as clear synapomorphies for both genera {{have yet to be}} identified. Most field guides treat the two genera together, often because Lactifluus is not yet recognised as a separate genus.|$|E

5|$|The galactic {{plane of}} the Milky Way passes through Perseus, but is much <b>less</b> <b>obvious</b> than {{elsewhere}} in the sky as it is mostly obscured by molecular clouds. The Perseus Arm is a spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy and stretches across the sky from the constellation Cassiopeia through Perseus and Auriga to Gemini and Monoceros. This segment is towards {{the rim of the}} galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Variations are {{markedly}} different with each subspecies. The eastern subspecies has more distinct spots on its chest, more white along the tips and retraces and obvious wing bars. T.c. palmeri has less spotting on chest and tips and <b>less</b> <b>obvious</b> wing bars. Other examples include T.c. curvirostre possessing longer wings and a tail than T.c. oberholseri; T.c. insularum is paler with more grey than T.c. palmeri {{and has more}} visible spotting on its breast.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{diversity}} of a harvested plant {{can be the}} result of genetic differences: a crop may have genes conferring early maturity or disease resistance Such traits collectively determine a crop's overall characteristics and their future potential. Diversity within a crop includes genetically-influenced attributes such as seed size, branching pattern, height, flower color, fruiting time, and flavor. Crops can also vary in <b>less</b> <b>obvious</b> characteristics such as their response to heat, cold, a drought, or their ability to resist specific diseases and pests.|$|E

5|$|The {{album was}} written and {{recorded}} {{in two months}} while the band was still on tour in support of their previous record, Happiness... Is Not a Fish That You Can Catch, which had only been released 14 months prior. A combination of lead singer-songwriter Raine Maida's prolific songwriting {{at the time and}} lead-guitarist Mike Turner's discovery of The Age of Spiritual Machines in a bookstore hurried the completion of the album. The band only took a break from recording to organize and perform at Summersault in 2000. Unlike their previous releases, this one features a more organic, acoustic sound, and <b>less</b> <b>obvious</b> layering and electronic texturing.|$|E
5|$|The newer {{technologies}} of road and rail {{led to the}} navigation falling into disuse. Some lengths of the system were drained or allowed to overgrow with vegetation. Increasingly {{the difference between the}} canal and the river became <b>less</b> <b>obvious,</b> although it is still possible to identify remains of the original locks. The threat to the remains which the construction of the M3 motorway posed spurred the Winchester Tenants and Residents Association and the local branch of the Inland Waterways Association into action in 1975, with both suggesting that the waterway could be restored. The two groups later co-operated, and the Itchen Navigation Preservation Society was formed.|$|E
5|$|Qwak! was {{released}} in a standard upright arcade cabinet with {{a black and white}} raster television monitor inset, with the rifle holster and start button below as the only controls. The reeds and tree branch overlay is screen printed in color onto a clear panel in front of the monitor, and is backlit by the screen; the screen is lit with a gray background instead of a black one in order to produce this effect. When the gun is triggered, the duck additionally flashes white briefly, so as to be detected by the light gun; the relative brightness of the screen makes this effect <b>less</b> <b>obvious</b> than with other similar light gun games. Qwak! was not the first light gun video game; it was preceded by the arcade game Balloon Gun (August 1974) and a light gun game for the Magnavox Odyssey video game console (1972), as well as non-video game light gun games since the 1936 Seeberg Ray-O-Lite.|$|E
50|$|The artwork for {{the album}} was {{designed}} by Peter Saville. Although <b>less</b> visually <b>obvious</b> {{than it had been}} with past releases, Avalon continued the tradition for Roxy Music albums to feature images of women on the cover artwork. Bryan Ferry's girlfriend (and soon to be wife) Lucy Helmore appeared on the album cover wearing a medieval helmet with a falcon perched on her gloved hand, evoking King Arthur's last journey to the mysterious land of Avalon.|$|R
40|$|The {{negative}} of {{the highest}} degree of the framing variable a in the Kauffman polynomial provides a bound for the Thurston-Bennequin number of Legendrian knots in a smooth knot type. This is a <b>less</b> than <b>obvious</b> connection between an invariant defined on smooth knots and an invariant defined only on Legendrian knots. In preparation for this theorem, this paper presents some elementary contact geometry necessary to discuss Legendrian knots and the Thurston-Bennequin number, and provides the somewhat extensive proof that the Kauffman polynomial is a well-defined invariant...|$|R
40|$|In this issue, Robert P. Holley, Professor of Library and Information Science at Wayne State University, {{looks at}} several {{important}} points about library planning and budgeting from his twenty five years’ {{experience as a}} library administrator. He chose these topics because they most often {{come as a surprise}} to students in his library management classes as well as his library colleagues. Understanding these few underappreciated and <b>less</b> than <b>obvious</b> management principles can help library managers grasp how libraries are different from for-profit organizations and how they can avoid some planning and budgeting traps...|$|R
5|$|Sir Arthur Elton (7th Bt) began {{updating}} {{the house before}} 1850 (and the lodge at the gate dates from 1851) {{but it was in}} 1860s that he made major changes. The west wing was extended and remodelled, this time with an Elizabethan style façade. <b>Less</b> <b>obvious</b> alterations to the east end (where the servants lived and worked) probably also date to this period. The fire of 1882 destroyed much of the western end of the house. In the rebuilding that followed, an even larger west end was constructed but Sir Arthur took pains to ensure that its Elizabethan south front was conserved and retained. Postcards of Clevedon reveal that the last change to the great hall window was made in about 1912, when it was given a square head again, in Elizabethan style.|$|E
5|$|The programmers {{identified}} {{early on}} that pathfinding—the ability of the variable-sized characters to navigate through the environment—would be a problem. Huebner cited the difficulty of programming characters to navigate {{an environment in which}} level designers are free to add stairs, ramps, and other 3D objects. They came up with a temporary solution and planned to improve the pathfinding later into development. By the time they properly addressed the problem, many of the levels were almost complete and featured few markers the programmers could use to control movement. They could identify walkable tiles but not walls, cliffs, and other environmental hazards. Ideal solutions, such as creating zones for characters could walk through would have taken too much time to retroactively add into the 100 created levels, so the programmers spent several weeks making small, iterative fixes to conceal the obvious errors in the pathfinding and leave <b>less</b> <b>obvious</b> ones intact.|$|E
5|$|Henry Walter Bates: (1825–1892) was an English explorer-naturalist who {{surveyed}} the Amazon rainforest with Alfred Russel Wallace in 1848. While Wallace returned in 1852, Bates remained {{for over a}} decade. His field research included collecting almost a hundred species of butterflies from the families Ithomiinae and Heliconiinae, as well as thousands of other insects specimens. In sorting these butterflies into similar groups based on appearance, inconsistencies began to arise. Some appeared superficially similar to others, even {{so much so that}} Bates could not tell some species apart based only on wing appearance. However, closer examination of <b>less</b> <b>obvious</b> morphological characters seemed to show that they were not even closely related. Shortly after his return to England he read a paper on his theory of mimicry {{at a meeting of the}} Linnean Society of London on 21 November 1861, which was then published in 1862 as 'Contributions to an Insect Fauna of the Amazon Valley' in the society's Transactions. He elaborated on his experiences further in The Naturalist on the River Amazons.|$|E
5000|$|What is {{now called}} [...] "post-process" [...] {{research}} demonstrates that it is seldom accurate to describe these [...] "stages" [...] as fixed steps in a straightforward process. Rather, they are more accurately conceptualized as overlapping parts of a complex whole or parts of a recursive process that are repeated multiple times throughout the writing process. Thus writers routinely discover that, for instance, editorial changes trigger brainstorming and a change of purpose; that drafting is temporarily interrupted to correct a misspelling; or that the boundary between prewriting and drafting is <b>less</b> than <b>obvious.</b>|$|R

Significantly dilated atria in the setting of a normal sized ventricle may be another easy visual marker for cardiac amyloidosis. Methods: A retrospective analysis of echocardiograms of patients with biopsy-proven cardiac amyloid compared with patients with hypertension was conducted. There were 36 patients in each group, and they were matched for left ventricular wall thickness, as well as age and sex. Results: Patients with cardiac amyloid had significantly larger atria than the group with hypertension (left atrial areas 29 cm versus 19 cm,...|$|R

This article explores the parallel literatures {{about the relationship}} between attitude and behavior in social psychology and the rabbinic tradition. Judaism, characterized by orthopraxy, has considerably more emphasis on legislated behavior than belief, doctrine, or attitude. Moreover, rabbinic text is replete with observations that complement the empirical demonstrations of social psychology. These relate to the causal influence of behavior on attitude, behavioral factors leading to internalization or externalization, and the relationship between effort and satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} that in a competitive business environment, firms’ performance will depend on their capacity to innovate. To clarifying how, when {{and to what extent}} innovation affects the market and financial performance of firms, the authors deploy seemingly unrelated regression equation model to examine innovation in over 500 Portuguese firms from 1998 to 2004. The results confirm, as theorists have frequently assumed, that innovation positively affects firms’ performance; but they also suggest that the reverse is true, a result that is <b>less</b> intuitively <b>obvious,</b> given the complexity of the innovation process and local, national and global competitive environments...|$|R
40|$|The {{constraint}} satisfaction problem {{is known to}} be NP-hard in general, but a number of restrictions of the problem have been identified over the years which ensure tractability. This paper introduces two simple methods of combining two or more tractable classes over disjoint domains, in order to synthesise larger, more expressive tractable classes. We demonstrate that the classes so obtained are genuinely novel, and have not been previously identified. In addition, we use algebraic techniques to extend the tractable classes which we identify, and to show that the algorithms for solving these extended classes can be <b>less</b> than <b>obvious...</b>|$|R

Often decisions are made without full consideration of the possible consequences, not necessarily intentionally, and some unsafe policy decisions can not be avoided, so there should be measures to identify them and mitigate them before they have adverse consequences.|$|R
