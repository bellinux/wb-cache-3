The events focused on how the Union and its Member States can promote a rules-based international system and effective multilateral institutions in a rapidly changing environment marked by numerous crises and challenges. The high-level discussion on the morning of 8 December featured keynote addresses from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, Bert Koenders, and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini. The high-level discussion also served as a prelude to the subsequent expert consultation, which was carried out according to the following methodology. The participants in the consultation were selected from among leading experts in EU foreign policy, global governance, European and international law, and multilateral diplomacy. Reflecting a diverse and representative set of stakeholders and professional perspectives, the experts came from think tanks, academia, international organizations, NGOs, and the private sector. Particular attention was paid to ensuring gender balance and including external perspectives from emerging powers and key partners of the EU, such as Brazil, Russia, India, China, and Nigeria. In the course of several breakout sessions and plenary discussions, the participants elaborated on the themes of: the EU’s role in developing the international legal order, promoting effective multilateral institutions, and engaging non-state actors in tackling the most pressing global challenges (see Annex I for the program). The expert consultation, held under the Chatham House Rule, was preceded by an e-consultation, which ran from mid-November and included a wider circle of experienced international specialists, as well as younger, emerging experts and youth representatives from diverse disciplines and professions (see Annex II for the summary of the econsultation).

30|$|Most of {{the western}} world, from the {{inception}} of the NAM, viewed the organization and its agenda with a sense of suspicion and negativity. The West, not without reasons, believed that the NAM was a pro-Soviet organization and some actors thought it was reactionary. The negativity was also extended to scholarship on this subject. Willetts (1978), in one of his critical analyses of the non-aligned, contended that “while I maintain non-alignment was not born until 1961 as a coherent group of ideas propounded by a group of relatively <b>like-minded</b> <b>states,</b> it has also been maintained by other people that non-alignment did not live beyond 1961 ” (p. 14). It was in 1961 that the organization, which people in the Third World celebrated as one of their major international achievements, was formed. The argument here is that the spirit of the institution died {{in the immediate aftermath of}} its launch. Willetts also did not believe that it was the Bandung Conference that catalyzed the movement. He argued, “One of the more frequent ways in which non-alignment is given false roots (emphasis mine) is by referring back to the Asian African Conference, which was held in the Indonesian city of Bandung in 1955 ” (Willetts 1978, p. 14).|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the response {{of a group of}} small and medium-sized states to the Global South 2 ̆ 7 s demands for a new international economic order in the 1970 s and early 1980 s. Reading that experience {{through the eyes of the}} group 2 ̆ 7 s smallest state, Ireland, it describes the rise of a loosely organised collective whose support for economic justice was based on three pillars: social democracy; Christian justice; and a broadly held (if variously defined) anti-colonialism. Internationalism, and in particular support for the institutions of the United Nations, became another distinguishing feature of like-minded action, and was an attempt by those states to carve out a space for independent action in the cold war. Detente and the decline of US hegemony helped in that respect, by encouraging a more globalist reading of the world order. Once the United States resumed its interventionist policies in the late 1970 s, the room for like-minded initiatives declined.

40|$|The GCC was forged as an {{alliance}} of politically <b>like-minded</b> <b>states</b> which sought to cooperate {{in the face of}} perceptibly increasing security threats. The conflict between Iraq and Iran presented security threats to the different Gulf Arab regimes. Saudi Arabia was concerned that the war could encourage some of the smaller states to bandwagon with one of the two adversaries. The smaller Gulf states were prepared to work with Saudi Arabia in preference to the greater threat of Iraq and Iran. The Gulf Arab hereditary regimes formed an association whose launch reflected Arab and national norms by not defining itself in opposition to others and by emphasizing economic operation, not common security interests. The ideational construct of Gulf cooperation proved insufficient to overcome the statecentric rationale of maximizing national sovereignty through loose regional political cooperation and bilateral defence pacts with Washington. The increased economic weight of some of the GCC states has seen a competitive search for international prestige that has sometimes been expressed through the construct of ‘regional’ interests but is fundamentally state-leadership focused. These leaderships remain pivotal in polities largely defined by a ruling family where there is little tradition or practical capacity for devolving authority.

30|$|Above all, I am {{convinced}} that ASEAN decision-makers {{are aware of the}} institutional weaknesses in ASEAN and want to address. This is evidenced by the introduction of the ASEAN Charter, which was seen as an important step forward for institutional reform as it strengthened its implementation and dispute-settlement mechanisms as well as consolidating its decision-making structure. However, although the ASEAN Charter did empower the existing ASEAN institutions and provided the Association with a juridical foundation, it seems to have codified traditional norms and practices as well as reinforcing the idea of non-intervention (Narine 2008 : 425). Therefore, in the post-Charter era I doubt that ASEAN will become a more effective organisation and all the institutional problems discussed will be properly tackled any time soon. In essence, it would appear to me that all the complications arise from the fact that ASEAN integration does not involve <b>like-minded</b> <b>states</b> in that the members do not share similar political ideologies and values. Furthermore, this political dissimilarity is safeguarded by the association’s norms and the consensus-based decision making, which continue to limit the role of its institutions, thus allowing member countries to enjoy cooperation and exercise power without fear of their sovereignty being at stake. This situation has resulted in deadlock, which has prevented the Association from making any considerable progress and so it ‘remains robustly intergovernmental, with little delegation since it relies on “offshoots” rather than independent agencies to implement policy’ (Capannelli and Tan 2012 : 14). All in all, granting mandates and pouring resources into the central institution will not fully resolve the problems, because it would still lack {{some of the most important}} ingredients for deeper cooperation. That is, in order to maximum benefits from constructing a regional community, this would need centralised policies, some degrees of supranationalism as well as the national governments’ willingness to cooperate and to delegate powers.|$|E
40|$|Within {{the current}} {{accepted}} {{paradigm of the}} international legal system, states are the only entities {{with the right to}} create international law. Recent experience however, shows that non-state entities, in particular non-governmental organizations, are increasingly becoming directly involved in the process of creating international law. This dissertation examines two cases [...] the Ottawa Process to ban landmines, and the International Criminal Court negotiations [...] to explore how NGOs contribute to international law creation, and whether they participate in the process of creating international law. In both cases NGOs engaged in a multitude of activities as they interacted with other entities involved in the negotiations. NGOs contributed to the process through: (a) agenda-setting; (b) creating conference agendas; (c) providing knowledge, expertise, and analysis; (d) negotiating with and between states; and (e) drafting instruments. In addition to these traditional activities, in these two cases NGOs also worked in coalition with each other, and with core-group and <b>like-minded</b> <b>states</b> to advance shared purposes. Multilateral negotiation theory and coalition dynamics offer a lens through which to understand how NGOs and states interacted with one-another in the process of creating international law. In working in alliances with similarly inclined states, NGOs contributed to three key aspects of coalition strength: (1) coalition size; (2) coalition diversity [...] through naming and shaming, contributing different resources and bargaining skills, taking risks, and securing support from civil society to leverage governments; and (3) communication functions [...] through intelligence networks, enrolment power, monitoring and analytical capacity, and institutionalized communications. NGOs worked alongside states, contributing to the effectiveness and strength of coalitions, and fulfilling the same roles as states, indeed, in some instances roles states could not fulfill on their own. By contributing to coalition strength and success, NGOs participated in the exercise of creating international law, even though they are not states. The result of this study is the recognition that two recent instances of international law creation fall outside the widely accepted understanding stating that only states create international law...|$|E
40|$|Like-minded {{co-operation}} {{has received}} relatively little {{attention in the}} literature of negotiation which traditionally has centered its focus on the study of coalition formation. Nevertheless, this concept of <b>like-minded</b> <b>states</b> is still referred to in various UN settings and often associated with the Nordic countries plus the Netherlands and in some cases Canada. Informal by nature and relatively small in size, this type of group may be defined as a subgroup of actors co-operating to achieve a common goal and influence the outcome of multilateral negotiations. A common trait is that the states forming these groups do not possess power in the traditional sense of the term. In the absence of structural power, these small and medium-sized states seek to gain influence by other means, namely through informal channels that operates within or on the margins of multilateral negotiations. This type of co-operation provides important sources of new ideas, norms and identities in the international system, and when such co-operation succeeds, it often serves to reframe international and domestic debates. The purpose of this thesis has been to draw some general conclusions on why co-operation among <b>like-minded</b> <b>states</b> come into being and what are its prospects for success. Two main research questions have been addressed: First, what may explain the emergence of like-minded co-operation? Second, under what conditions is this type of co-operation likely to be successful? Three independent variables were identified to be of relevance to the first research question; common values and interest, elite networks and triggering events. For the second research question the analysis has focused on the three independent variables relating {{to the nature of the}} problem, the nature of the group and exogenous factors. Two empirical cases form the basis of this analysis, illustrating two different situations in which like-minded co-operation has emerged. The first case concerns the like-minded group emerging as part of the negotiations on the New International Economic Order in the mid 1970 s. During talks, the negotiating parties were unable to identify a solution and some countries feared a deadlock. With the aim of building a compromise between competing positions, Norway and the Netherlands initiated a like-minded group that was to facilitate the negotiations. The second case concerns a like-mined group known as the Human Security Network that was initiated by Canada as a bilateral partnership with Norway in 1998. Not related to any specific negotiation this value-based co-operation focus on issues that relate to Human Security. The aim of this group has been to act as a promoter on the international arena of ideas and values that relate to a humanitarian agenda. Methodologically this is a process-oriented analysis, taking the nation state as its unit of analysis. Theoretically, this study has tried to make use of the existing contributions in the negotiation literature on coalition theory. This has proved difficult since like-minded co-operation is similar to a coalition, however not identical. The main challenge of this thesis has therefore been to develop a theoretical framework relevant to the study of like-minded co-operation. The study argues that instead of traditional approaches to coalition study, the approaches by Barry Buzan on the formation of informal groups, the contributions by John Kingdon on public policy making as well as the approaches by Kathryn Sikkink and Keck on trans-national advocacy network should be applied. In view of the first research question- why co-operation among like-minded co-operation emerges- the analysis indicates that both common interests and the presence of elite networks seem to have some explanatory value when explaining the emergence of this type of groups. The third variable, that of a triggering event, seem to be of less relevance. As what concerns the second research question- the conditions needed for this type of co-operation to be successful- all three independent variables (the nature of the problem, the nature of the group and exogenous events) seem to hold some relevance. On a more general level this thesis illustrates that like-minded co-operation emerges in different settings, may have different objectives and play different roles inside and outside multilateral negotiations. These initiatives are the results of interest, timing and a common vision by political elites representing small and medium-sized states. The advantage of these networks seems to lie in their informal nature, the non-institutionalization and their flexibility. When this type of co-operation succeeds it represents an important element to be considered when explaining changes on the international arena. As such, they represent an important foreign policy tool that deserves long-term commitment by the states having an interest in this area...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{determine}} whether the Security Council has opened a new avenue for law-making at the international level by adopting resolutions under Chapter VII of the UN Charter which create new norms of international law or modify international norms already in force (the normative resolutions). The normative resolutions analyzed in this study pertain to the areas of counterterrorism and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass-destruction. The new approach of the Security Council has been examined in light of the Third World Approaches in International law (TWAIL), {{as well as from the}} viewpoint of mainstream lawyers. Furthermore, 15 years of State practice relating to the implementation of these normative resolutions has been studied with a view to determining whether subsequent State practice confirms the exercise of a law-making function by the Security Council. Despite some incremental success in promoting international standards in the fight against terrorism, this thesis illustrates that the Security Council has not succeeded in introducing a new viable form of law-making. The Security Council’s authority to exercise such a function is now under serious doubt and its legitimacy questioned, as its normative resolutions were improperly initiated and adopted under the influence of a Permanent Member of the Security Council. Furthermore, the Security Council’s intervention in areas that are already highly regulated runs the risk of contributing to the fragmentation of international law—a phenomenon that undermines the coherence of international law. Currently, the Council’s normative resolutions are facing serious challenges at the implementation stage and several proceedings before national and regional courts have either directly challenged the normative resolutions, or questioned their enforceability. The Security Council is under continued pressure to further revise its practice or potentially face additional challenges before national, regional, and even international courts which may annul or quash relevant implementing measures. Thus, in light of relevant State practice, it is almost inconceivable that the Security Council would repeat its use of normative resolutions as a means of law-making in the future. Nevertheless, the increasing powers of the United Nations Security Council also stimulates an increasing demand to hold the United Nations accountable for the possible wrongful acts of its principal organ, particularly when its decisions harm individuals. It is argued that in the absence of a compulsory judicial mechanism at the international level, non-compliance with the Council’s decisions is the only viable way to challenge the Security Council wrongful acts. Yet, non-complying State or group of States should clearly identify their actions as countermeasures vis-a-vis ultra vires acts of Security Council and seek support from other <b>like-minded</b> <b>States</b> to avoid being declared recalcitrant, which may be followed by Security Council sanctions...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{humanitarian}} arms control {{emerged in the}} context of the new security challenges of the 21 st century. The 1997 Ban on Anti-Personnel Mines, the 2001 Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons (PoA) and the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions all set out to introduce arms control instruments to regulate not only uncontrolled transfers of arms, but also to end or to limit the indiscriminate use of weapons, and to deal with the long-term effects following intra-state conflicts. The three institutions share similar characteristics and thus permit the conclusion that a structural change has taken place in arms control and disarmament. This change is a consequence of the changed security environment after the end of the Cold War: Fragile statehood, economic under-development, internal state conflicts, terrorism and transnational organized crime provided the international state community with new challenges calling for different and new forms of arms control. This report identifies the indicators for this change and examines the reasons for the development of particular forms of arms control and disarmament. The three regimes banning anti-personnel mines and cluster munitions and restricting the illicit trafficking of small arms and light weapons all show similar characteristics which were decisive for their evolution and have given a new face to arms control as a whole. The key normative agents that were decisive for this structural change included transnational campaigns by non-governmental organizations as well as a number of small and medium-sized states. These alliances managed to get the arms control agreements off the ground despite opposition from the leading powers. Two factors were remarkable: On the one hand, the special negotiating formats which were set up for the Ottawa and Oslo processes and, on the other hand, “new diplomacy”, which was characterized by a mutual “give and take” between the different actors. By involving NGOs, <b>like-minded</b> <b>states</b> sought global public support and gained additional legitimacy for their ambivalent undertaking. By granting civil society stakeholders the right to participate in the negotiations, these states also enabled NGOs to gain certain influence on the norm generation processes. The change of perspective on arms control also becomes visible in a different, individualized understanding of security. Instead of concentrating exclusively on improving state’s security, attention is now being increasingly directed towards human security. Embedded in the concept of “human security”, one finds references to larger concepts such as development aims and conflict resolution practices. Humanitarian arms control is concerned with mitigating the consequences of the use of weapons as well as their deliberate misuse during and following intra-state conflicts. This new understanding of arms control lies within the wider context of security sector reform, which seeks to make fragile states capable of guaranteeing public security again, but it also addresses individual human needs in post-conflict situations such as victim rehabilitation and reintegration. The new arms control and disarmament agreements are an outcome of specific normgenerating processes which are to be seen {{in the context of}} “new humanitarianism”. The most visible expression and, at the same time, probably the most controversial expression II of this new humanitarianism are a number of military interventions in response to gross violations of human rights and the deliberate disregard of international humanitarian law, as for example in Ruanda or Bosnia. Questions of justice are becoming the direct legitimization for state action and have also inspired and triggered norm-generation processes in other policy fields – for example, the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC). Moral convictions or questions of justice also motivated norm generating actors in the field of humanitarian arms control. In all three cases under consideration, the need for a new institution was determined by the moral conviction that action must be taken against numerous incidents of severe injustice where innocent people and civilians were killed or wounded by the indiscriminate use of these weapons in cases of intra-state conflicts. This conviction is based on one of the few global concepts of justice in international relations which is also anchored in international humanitarian law, such as the principle of need and proportionality. At the same time, this moral conviction has provided the basis for norm development in the field of humanitarian arms control: The suffering of the civilian population as a result of the use of antipersonnel mines or cluster munitions prompted non-governmental organizations to demand of states to take action and seek a norm banning the use of such weapons. Certain convictions of justice, which seem to be shared in the international system of states, were finally enshrined in the principles, norms and procedures of the three regimes. According to the principle of equality, for example, all states parties must renounce the use of anti-personnel mines or cluster munitions and compile an overview of their national stocks of small arms. A further characteristic of humanitarian arms control is the comprehensive application of the principles of proportionality, need and compensation. For example, the costs-by-cause principle applies to the clearance of cluster munitions. Those states which are particularly affected can rely on technical as well as financial support under the Ban on Anti-Personnel Mines and the Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons. This structural change towards humanitarian arms control is significant for arms control and for disarmament as a whole. However, the moral convictions and the principles of justice demanded by the NGOs in particular touched the limits of national and national security interests. Normative conflicts occurred in the negotiating processes of all three regimes; particularly over question of the appropriate definition of weapons categories, but also with regard to the possible renunciation of sovereignty, for example banning transfers of arms to non-state actors or prohibiting the private possession of weapons. Although the principles of proportionality, necessity and compensation and the recognition of the special needs of the affected states provided an important impetus for the negotiations, the actual implementation process, particularly of the PoA, has been very slow. Das Anti-Personenminenverbot von 1997, das Kleinwaffenaktionsprogramm von 2001 und die Streubombenkonvention von 2008 weisen auf einen Formenwandel in der Rüstungskontrolle hin. Alle drei Regime fokussieren stärker die menschliche Sicherheit und vertreten sicherheits- wie entwicklungspolitische Ziele. Die entscheidenden Initiatoren waren Nichtregierungsorganisationen, transnationale Kampagnen und Klein- und Mittelmächte, die, vereint durch überkulturelle Gerechtigkeitsvorstellungen, zu Normunternehmern wurden. Sie förderten neue Verhandlungsformen und konfrontierten die bestehende politische Verhandlungskultur mit einem diplomatischen Miteinander. Simone Wisotzki ermittelt die Indikatoren des Formenwandels, stellt die Gründe dar und benennt die Probleme, wenn globale Ziele der humanitären Rüstungskontrolle mit nationalstaatlichen Sicherheitsinteressen kollidieren. Sie verweist auf die Herausforderungen, die nach wie vor zu bewältigen sind, etwa die fehlenden globalen Normen zur Begrenzung des staatlichen Waffenhandels in Kriegs- und Krisengebiete, und fordert eindringlich, weitere Normentwicklung in der humanitären Rüstungskontrolle zu unterstützen...|$|E
