50|$|The {{screw and nut}} {{may have}} very fine {{identical}} single- or two-start threads. Recirculating rollers are grooved (instead of threaded) so they move axially during spinning engagement with the threads of the nut and screw, shifting up or down by one <b>lead</b> <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> after completing an orbit around the screw. The nut assembly typically includes a slotted cage and cam rings. The cage captivates the rollers in elongated slots, equally spacing the rollers while permitting rotation and axial motion of the rollers. The cam rings have opposing cams aligned with an axial groove in {{the wall of the}} nut. After a roller completes an orbit about the nut it is released into the groove, disengages from nut and screw, and is pushed between the cams to the axial midpoint of the nut assembly (shifting by a distance equal to the lead of the screw). Returned to its starting position, and reengaged to nut and screw, the roller may then orbit the screw once again.|$|E

2500|$|Single-point threading, also colloquially called single-pointing (or just {{thread cutting}} when the context is implicit), is an {{operation}} that uses a single-point tool to produce a thread form on a cylinder or cone. The tool moves [...] while the precise rotation of the workpiece determines the <b>lead</b> <b>of</b> the <b>thread.</b> The process {{can be done to}} create external or internal threads (male or female). In external thread cutting, the piece can either be held in a chuck or mounted between two centers. With internal thread cutting, the piece is held in a chuck. The tool moves across the piece linearly, taking chips off the workpiece with each pass. Usually 5 to 7 light cuts create the correct depth <b>of</b> the <b>thread.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{mechanical}} advantage <b>of</b> a screw <b>thread</b> {{depends on its}} lead, which is the linear distance the screw travels in one revolution. In most applications, the <b>lead</b> <b>of</b> a screw <b>thread</b> is chosen so that friction is sufficient to prevent linear motion being converted to rotary, that is so the screw does not slip even when linear force is applied so long as no external rotational force is present. This characteristic {{is essential to the}} vast majority of its uses. The tightening of a fastener's screw thread is comparable to driving a wedge into a gap until it sticks fast through friction and slight elastic deformation.|$|R

Methods: Total num ber of 100 cylindrical orthodontic mini-implants was used. Geo met-rical design {{characteristics of}} ten specimens of ten types of cylindrical self-drilling orthodontic mini-implants (Ortho EasyÂ®, Aarhus, and Dual TopTM) with diameters ranging from 1. 4 to 2. 0 mm and lengths of 6 and 8 mm were measured. Maximum insertion torque was recorded during manual insertion of mini-implants into bone samples. Cortical bone thickness was measured. Retrieved data were analyzed in a multiple regression model. Results: Significant predictors for higher maximum insertion torque included larger outer diameter <b>of</b> implant, higher <b>lead</b> angle <b>of</b> <b>thread,</b> and thicker cortical bone, and their unique contribution to maximum insertion torque was 12. 3 %, 10. 7 %, and 24. 7 %, respectively.

METHODS: Images of the active tips of the mini-implants were obtained with a Zeiss optical microscope, Stemi 200 -C with magnification of 1. 6 X. The images of the surface were viewed with the Axio Vision program (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) to calculate linear and angular measures. Mini-implant morphology and the details <b>of</b> tips and <b>threads</b> were also evaluated through Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM) (JEOL, model JSM 5800 LV - JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) with magnifications of 90 X and 70 X, respectively.

40|$|Based on the {{differential}} principle <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> transmission, an analytical model considering helical directions between screw and roller threads in planetary roller screw mechanism (PRSM) {{is presented in}} this work. The model is critical {{for the design of}} PRSM with a smaller lead and a bigger pitch to realize a higher transmission accuracy. The kinematic principle of planetary transmission is employed to analyze the PRSM with different screw thread and roller thread directions. In order to investigate the differences with different screw thread and roller thread directions, the numerical model is developed by using the software Adams to validate the analytical solutions calculated by the presented model. The results indicate, when the helical direction <b>of</b> screw <b>thread</b> is identical with the direction <b>of</b> roller <b>thread,</b> that the <b>lead</b> <b>of</b> PRSM is unaffected regardless of whether sliding between screw and rollers occurs or not.

Classification comprises also combined tools based on design <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mill, which allow us to reduce the nomenclature of the tools used in threading. The paper considers working schemes of the main types <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mills and areas of their rational application. To analyse design data <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mills two types of tools have been selected, namely the integral trailer edge thread mills with the spiral chip flutes and drill thread mills made from hard alloy.
