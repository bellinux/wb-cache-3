40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} examine how apparent depth of a subjective contour letter is affected by location and form of shading attatched to the letter. Twenty participants rated a list of <b>letters</b> with <b>shading</b> in various (bottom, lower left, left, upper left, top, upper right, right, and lower right) according to apparent depth in Experiment 1, while 56 participants rated letters consisted of lines varying in symmetry in Experiment 2. Experiment 1 showed that the rating of apparent depth was higher with the <b>letters</b> <b>shaded</b> in positions diagonal to the letter than in vertical or horizontal position. Experiment 2 reproduced {{the effect of the}} position of shading obtained in Experiment 1, and showed that the rating was different between the letters reversed vertically. The rating of form for each letters were compatible with that of the apparent depth in both experiments. The results indicate that apparent depth is affected by position and form of a shading...|$|R
40|$|Seventeen {{students}} {{were required to}} perform visual search task to examine how <b>shading</b> affected <b>letter</b> recognition. The stimulus display consisted of eight letters with a subjective outline arranged equidistantly in an imaginary circle. The letters were M, O, or R with shading in the positions of BOTTOM, LLEFT (lower left), LEFT, ULEFT (upper left), TOP, URIGHT (upper right), RIGHT, and LRIGHT (lower right). The RT was measured for determining {{whether or not a}} stimulus display contained a target <b>letter</b> with <b>shading</b> in a different position from the distractor letters. The RT for M and O was shortest when distradctors were shaded in LRIGHT or ULEFT position for the target condition and when all the <b>letters</b> were <b>shaded</b> in LRIGHT or ULEFT position. The RT for R was shortest when all the <b>letters</b> were <b>shaded</b> in LRIGHT, BOTTOM, or LLEFT positions. The results indicated that a shading in LRIGHT position help the letter to be recognized...|$|R

40|$|With {{raster display}} systems, images on a monitor show jaggedness, {{because they are}} defined by integer {{coordinates}} of the monitor. This jaggedness is called an aliasing effect. To reduce this, engineers developed algorithms. One well-known algorithm is supersampling. This is accomplished by sampling at a higher resolution and reducing the sampled data to a lower resolution. We overlaid arrays of a 3 x 3 matrix on a text (supersampling) and reduced each array to a pixel on a monitor. In this process, engineers determined {{the level of the}} pixel luminance-intensity linearly to the number of elements painted in each array. Instead of using such direct, linear transformation, we determined the level of brightness, not the level of the pixel intensity, to produce better shading. Brightness, not luminance, is subjective. We created nine sets of gray levels based on this algorithm. We ran two experiments to choose the optimal graylevel set. In Experiment 1, participants chose the more legible of two <b>letters</b> <b>shaded</b> with different gray-level sets. In Experiment 2, participants counted target-letters in a string of letters as fast as they could. The experimental results did not favor gray-level sets that were close to the traditional linear transformation from the number of painte...|$|R

25|$|From 1905 to 1923 front-line express {{locomotives}} were a dark {{shade of}} umber. Lining was black with a gilt line either side. Cab roofs remained white. Frames were black, wheels umber, and buffer beams returned to signal red. The company's initials were {{painted on the}} tender- or tank-sides (initially 'L.B.& S.C.R.', but after 1911 the ampersand and the R were removed) in gilt. Secondary passenger locomotives had the same livery, but instead of gilt lining chrome yellow paint was used. Goods engines were gloss black with double vermillion lining. Names and numbers were in white <b>letters</b> with red <b>shading.</b> Carriages were initially all olive green with white lining and detailing. From 1911 this changed to plain umber with black lettering picked out with gold shading.|$|R
5000|$|Benton invented many of {{the most}} {{important}} type founding technologies of the day, including a mould (1882), self spacing type (1883), a punch cutter (1885), combination fractions (1895), a type dressing machine (1901), a matrix and punch-cutting machine (1906), and automatic type-caster (1907), and a lining device for engraving matrices of <b>shaded</b> <b>letters</b> (1913). One of his most famous inventions was the Benton Pantograph, an engraving machine which was capable not only of scaling a single font design pattern to a variety of sizes, but could also condense, extend, and slant the design. [...] (Mathematically, these are cases of affine transformation, which is the fundamental geometric operation of most systems of digital typography today, including PostScript.) The technology allowed metal type to be designed on large plan drawings and then cut at the desired size, rather than being hand-engraved at the desired size.|$|R

What kind {{of place}} can the quiet townspeople who see the words emblazoned, in all the {{legibility}} of gilt <b>letters</b> and dark <b>shading,</b> on the north-country coaches, take Snow Hill to be? All people have some undefined and shadowy notion of a place whose name is frequently before their eyes, or often in their ears. What {{a vast number of}} random ideas there must be perpetually floating about, regarding this same Snow Hill. The name is such a good one. Snow Hill--Snow Hill too, coupled with a Saracen's Head: picturing to us by a double association of ideas, something stern and rugged! A bleak desolate tract of country, open to piercing blasts and fierce wintry storms--a dark, cold, gloomy heath, lonely by day, and scarcely to be thought of by honest folks at night--a place which solitary wayfarers shun, and where desperate robbers congregate;--this, or something like this, should be the prevalent notion of Snow Hill, in those remote and rustic parts, through which the Saracen's Head, like some grim apparition, rushes each day and night with mysterious and ghost-like punctuality; holding its swift and headlong course in all weathers, and seeming to bid defiance to the very elements themselves.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCurrent {{theories}} of reading eye movements claim that reading saccades are programmed {{primarily on the}} basis of information about the length of the upcoming word, determined by low-level visual processes that detect spaces to the right of fixation. Many studies attempted to test this claim by filling spaces between words with various non-space symbols (fillers). This manipulation, however, confounds the effect of inserting extraneous characters into text with the effect of obscuring word boundaries by filling spaces. We performed the control conditions necessary to unconfound these effects. Skilled readers read continuous stories aloud and silently. Three factors were varied: (i) position of the fillers in the text (at the beginning, the end, or surrounding each word); (ii) {{the presence or absence of}} spaces in the text; and (iii) the effect of the type of filler on word recognition (from greatest effect to least effect: Latin letters, Greek <b>letters,</b> digits and <b>shaded</b> boxes). The effect of fillers on reading depended more on the type of filler than on the presence of spaces. The greater effect the fillers had on word recognition, the more they slowed reading. Surrounding each word with digits or Greek letters slowed reading as much as filling spaces with these symbols. Surrounding each word with randomly chosen letters, while preserving spaces, slowed reading by 44 – 75 %—as much as, or more than, removing spaces from normal text. Removing spaces from text with Latin-letter fillers slowed reading by only 10 – 20 % more. We conclude that fillers in text disrupt reading by affecting word recognition directly, without necessarily affecting the eye movement pattern...|$|R
40|$|Recently a {{monograph}} appeared {{dealing with}} Roman epigraphical monuments from the West-Serbian town of Čačak and its neighbourhood (S. Ferjančić / G. Jeremić / A. Gojgić, Roman Epigraphic Monuments from Čačak and its Vicinity Čačak 2008, Engl. Summary pp. 103 - 107). Authored by one specialist in Roman history and epigraphy and two archaeologists, {{the book is}} rather thin and does not provide much new data, apart from {{the identification of the}} equestrian officer Tiberius Claudius Gallus with Severus' senator - which was taken from my PhD thesis without citing it - and from two inscriptions, № 20 and № 21, forming the subject of the present paper. Published here for the first time, they both contain important information which the co-authors failed to notice. The consuls of 227 A. D. in an inscription from Čačak The № 21 (fig. 1) was found in the site of Gradina on the mountain Jelica, S. of Čačak. It is engraved on a whitish limestone monument, apparently an ara, the middle and lower parts of which are preserved after it has been reshaped to be used as building material. The four-line inscription was read by the editors as follows: [- - -] Aur(elius) F[- - - v(otum) ] l(ibens) p(osuit) Mal+[- - -]et Al[- - - co(n) s(ulibus) ] Idibus [- - -]. Unable to identify the pair of consuls mentioned in lines two and three, the authors interpret the inscription as a funerary one: [- - -]Aur(elius or -elio) F[- - - vix(it) ann(is) ] L P. Mal+[- - -]et Al[- - - f(ecerunt) ? die ?] Idibus [- - -]. In fact, they misread the final cluster of the line two, by having mistaken for L the long right serif of M (in ligature with A) together with a trace of a subsequent letter, which proves to be an X. The alignment of the letters {{at the beginning of the}} lines suggests that the left side of the inscription is entirely preserved. The inscription reads as folows:] Aur(elius) F+[-] l(ibens) p(osuit) Max[imo] et Al[bino co(n) s(ulibus) ] Idibus [-]. M. Laelius Maximus Aemilianus (PIR 2 L 56) - probably son of Marcus Laelius Maximus (PIR 2 L 55), one of the leading senators under Septimius Severus - and M. Nummius Senecio Albinus (PIR 2 N 235) were the eponymous consuls of 227. The pair is attested in several inscriptions, e. g. CIL VIII 18831 from Numidia which resembles this one in recording the exact date: Bacaci Aug(usto) sac(rum) Albino et Ma co(n) s(ulibus) Kal(endis) Mai(is) [3] Si Novellus et Q. Galerius Mu magg(istri) [Thib(ilitanorum?) ]. Here Albinus' name precedes that of Maximus, which is usually the case. Nevertheless, a parallel with Maximus named before Albinus is provided by an inscription from Dacia (ILD 774, near Cluj) : Deae Ne sac Aur(elius) Ru[f]inus be(ne) f(iciarius) co(n) s(ularis) leg(ionis) XIII Gem(inae) Sever(ianae) v(otum) l(ibens) p(osuit) Maximo et Albino] co(n) s(ulibus). Consequently, № 21 is a votive inscription, largely restorable and precisely datable. The Collegium curatorum of the Cohors II Delmatarum in an inscription from Čačak Forty years ago within the Ascension Church yard in Čačak the lower part of a Roman limestone monument has been accidentally unearthed, bearing an inscription, three last lines of which are partially preserved (№ 20 of the catalogue, (fig. 2), wherein only the mention of a cohort was recognized by the editors, who read:]- - -]ALB[- - -| -]GIATI +[- - -|- - -co]h(ortis) eiusde(m) [- - -|- - - The elegant, <b>shaded</b> <b>letters</b> are lined up one below the other, which suggests that the text was arranged following the principle of centering. Above the L in the first line there is a trace of an O or a Q, unnoticed by the editors. So, there are 4 lines partially preserved. The space left between the lines 2 and 3 being larger than that between 1 - 2 and 3 - 4 respectively, the two last lines seem to constitute a separate entry. The genitive case cohortis eiusdem implies a preceding designation of the dedicant(s), and what we have before is a nominative plural ending in ‑giati followed by a word of which only the first letter, C or O, is still discernible. As the most probable, if not the only possible, we propose the following restoration of the last two lines (fig. 8) : [colle]giati c[urat(ores) ]|[co]h(ortis) eiusde[m] possibly with a p(osuerunt) or d(edicaverunt) in the end. Despite its fragmentariness, the present inscription bears an important testimony to the existence, within the Roman army, of professional associations (collegia militaria) independent of regular military structures. The evidence for them is based solely on epigraphic sources; some hundred inscriptions contradict the paragraph of the Digesta (47. 22) forbidding the soldiers to organize corporate associations in the camps. The cohort in question is doubtless the cohors II Aurelia Delmatarum milliaria equitata, which is known to have been stationed permanently, from the seventies of the second century A. D. to the fifties of the third century, in the eastern part of Dalmatia around the modern city of Čačak. It was a mixed infantry and cavalry unit, and the rank of curator (curator equitum singularium, curator alae, curator cohortis) is attested exclusively in the mounted units of the Roman army. It was higher than the simple eques; in the auxiliary troops, the curators may have been charged with special tactical or economic-administrative tasks. The lower officers (principales) and the soldiers with special tasks were allowed to form private associations fostering loyalty to the Emperor. All Roman collegia including the military ones, had their religious purpose and their official meeting room (schola) was also a sanctuary of their patron deity. It might be a part of the headquarters building, as in the case of the Castra Nova equitum singularium in Rome, where, beneath the Basilica of St John Lateran an Ionic capitel was uncovered with inscription on it dated with AD 197 recording the dedication of the schola curatorum to Minerva Augusta (AE 1935 156 = AE 1968, 8 b) ...|$|R
