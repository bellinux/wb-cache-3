500|$|A {{second case}} was filed, with younger plaintiffs not {{effected}} by laches, led by Amanda Blackhorse. The <b>linguistic</b> <b>expert</b> for the petitioners, Geoffrey Nunberg, successfully argued that whatever its origins, [...] "redskins" [...] was a slur {{at the time}} of the trademarks, based upon the passages from books and newspapers and the movie clips in which the word is inevitably associated with contempt, derision, condescension, or sentimental paeans to the noble savage. [...] "Nigger" [...] also began as a benign reference to skin color, only to become a racial slur through disparaging use. On June 18, 2014, the TTAB again voted to cancel the trademarks in a two to one decision that held that the term [...] "redskins" [...] is disparaging to a [...] "substantial composite of Native Americans." [...] Evidence of disparagement include the frequent references to [...] "scalping" [...] made by sportswriters for sixty years when reporting the Redskins loss of a game, and passages from movies made from the 1940s to the 1960s using [...] "redskin" [...] to refer to Native Americans as a savage enemy. The TTAB majority held that the NCAI represented about 30 percent of Native Americans during the time in question, which the Board found satisfied the substantial composite test of the trademark law.|$|E

This has lead to a categorization of active and passive connectors. We used the introduced notion of active and passive connectors to develop an algorithm that respects the semantic of the text to identify the segments of a given Arabic text. The algorithm has been implemented and experimented with.

The VUE had given Bwythan a bone-marrow deficiency, wattles and cobs along his backbone, and a foot disease that shredded his toe-nails. He could drink salt water without harm but felt listless and debilitated away from the influence of chlorophyll, which is why there were always several plantpots in his office, and even on his desk. Bwythan could speak fourteen VUE languages and interpret successfully in nine of them at a diplomatic level. It was Bwythan who had organised the examination of Agropio Fallaver, the sole speaker of the language named after him. Although Bwythan {{had come to the}} private opinion that Fallaver was somehow a fake manoeuvred by FOX, the Society for Ornithological Extermination. Bwythan has privately researched the ten-thousand most popularly used words in forty-three of the main VUE languages and has produced a comparative dictionary. From this research he wrote a book, View from Babel, to explain, or attempt to explain the gift of tongues and the fragmentation of language. In trying to do this, and in his associated search for a common linguistic denominator, he successfully demonstrated that the names of birds were important key words. It was rumoured that {{it was because of the}} conclusions of his research that Bwythan was run down by a white van, registration number NID 92, on a zebra crossing in the Goldhawk Road. A van with the same registration had been seen outside Bwythan's house an hour before the accident. The police later found the vehicle responsible on a deserted airfield.
