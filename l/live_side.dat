5|$|The {{setting of}} the main series is a Northern European-style dark fantasy world where humans and creatures from myth and legends <b>live</b> <b>side</b> by side, while the {{spin-off}} game is set in an alternative reality leading {{from one of the}} first game's possible endings. The stories generally focus on the fortunes and personalities {{of a small group of}} protagonists either directly or indirectly connected to and affected by the events of the story. Dark or mature plot and character themes and multiple endings have become a staple of the series. Their popularity in Japan has resulted in multiple adaptions and additional media in the form of novelizations and manga.|$|E

According to the 2005 Scholastic Book of World Records, Louisiana has the largest alligator population. The majority of American alligators inhabit Florida and Louisiana, with over a million alligators in each state. Southern Florida is the only place where both alligators and crocodiles <b>live</b> <b>side</b> by side.|$|E

25|$|After Singapore gained {{independence}} and autonomy in the 1960s, the Singapore government undertook measures to help foster racial harmony in Singapore. It encouraged various races of different languages and religious backgrounds to intermingle and to <b>live</b> <b>side</b> by side. Following the growth of Singaporean nationhood and national identity, the Chinese immigrants began to change their mindset from temporary migration to permanent settlements, thus soiling their roots in Singapore. With the strengthening of Singaporean national identity, the Chinese clans association gradually declined in terms of importance. Their role of organising and governing the Chinese community was soon {{taken over by the}} Singapore government.|$|E
25|$|As {{parts of}} Jazz Track and Jazz at the Plaza, respectively, the 58 Sessions chronicled the {{transition}} from the brawny agitation of Milestones, to the cerebral tranquility of Kind of Blue. The recording sessions also became known as a stepping stone in Davis' move from bebop to modal jazz. The <b>live</b> <b>side</b> in particular was seen by critics as a glimpse at the sextet that would record Kind of Blue. The complimentary and seemingly spontaneous style of performance ethic and the relationship between Davis and his musicians was fundamental for his work during these sessions and improved onto the Kind of Blue sessions.|$|E
25|$|Israel is {{currently}} home to about 1,728 species of fish, 410 of {{which in the}} Mediterranean and 1,270 in the Red Sea. The rest, 48 species, are cultivated or wild freshwater fish. The fish population has declined and endemic species such as Nemacheilus dori have become endangered. Acanthobrama hulensis became extinct in the 1970s following a decline in population after the drying of the Hula lake. In 2012, the Acanthobrama telavivensis, was which was nearly extinct, reappeared in the Yarkon River {{after a decade of}} rehabilitation and preservation efforts.

25|$|Vodun {{cosmology}} {{centers around}} the vodun spirits and other elements of divine essence that govern the Earth, a hierarchy that range in power from major deities governing {{the forces of nature}} and human society to the spirits of individual streams, trees, and rocks, as well as dozens of ethnic vodun, defenders of a certain clan, tribe, or nation. The vodun are the center of religious life, similar in many ways to doctrines such as the intercession of saints and angels that made Vodun appear compatible with Christianity, especially Catholicism, and produced syncretic religions such as Haitian Vodou. Adherents also emphasize ancestor worship and hold that the spirits of the dead <b>live</b> <b>side</b> by side with the world of the living, each family of spirits having its own female priesthood, sometimes hereditary when it's from mother to blood daughter.|$|E

500|$|Crocodilians are [...] reptiles, {{spending}} part {{of their}} time in water and part on land. The last surviving fully terrestrial genus, Mekosuchus, became extinct about 3000 years ago after humans had arrived on its Pacific islands, making the extinction possibly anthropogenic. Typically they are creatures of the tropics; the main exceptions are the American and Chinese alligators, whose ranges extend as far north as the south-eastern United States and the Yangtze River, respectively. Florida, in the United States, is the only place that crocodiles and alligators <b>live</b> <b>side</b> by side. Most crocodilians live in the lowlands, and few are found above , where the temperatures are typically about 5°C (9°F) lower than at the coast. None of them permanently reside in the sea, though some can venture into it, and several species can tolerate the brackish water of estuaries, mangrove swamps, and the extreme salinity of hypersaline lakes. The saltwater crocodile has the widest distribution of any crocodilian, with a range extending from eastern India to New Guinea and northern Australia. Much of its success is due to its ability to swim out to sea and colonise new locations, but it is not restricted to the marine environment and spends much time in estuaries, rivers, and large lakes.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, Australian poet Peter Porter, {{reviewing}} Murray's New Collected Poems, makes {{a somewhat}} similar paradoxical assessment of Murray: [...] "A skewer of polemic runs through his work. His brilliant manipulation of language, {{his ability to}} turn words into installations of reality, is often forced to hang on an embarrassing moral sharpness. The parts we love – the Donne-like baroque – <b>live</b> <b>side</b> by side with sentiments we don't: his increasingly automatic opposition to liberalism and intellectuality." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1931, Iraqi Kurdish statesman Mihemed Emîn Zekî, {{while serving}} as the Minister of the Economy in the first Nuri as-Said government, drew the {{boundaries}} of Turkish Kurdistan as: [...] "With mountains of Ararat and the Georgian border (including the region of Kars, where Kurds and Georgians <b>live</b> <b>side</b> by side) to the north, Iranian border to the east, Iraqi border to the south, and to the west, a line drawn from the west of Sivas to İskenderun. These boundaries are also in accord with those drawn by the Ottomans." [...] In 1932, Garo Sassouni, formerly a prominent figure of Dashnak Armenia, defined the borders of [...] "Kurdistan proper" [...] (excluding whole territory of Wilsonian Armenia) as: [...] "... with {{a line from the}} south of Erzincan to Kharput, incorporating Dersim, Çarsancak, and Malatya, including the mountains of Cebel-i Bereket and reaching the Syrian border", also adding, [...] "these are the broadest boundaries of Kurdistan that can be claimed by Kurds." ...|$|E

60|$|The celebrated palaeontologist, Bronn, at {{the close}} of his German {{translation}} of this work, asks how, on the principle of natural selection, can a variety <b>live</b> <b>side</b> by side with the parent species? If both have become fitted for slightly different habits of life or conditions, they might live together; and if we lay on one side polymorphic species, in which the variability seems to be of a peculiar nature, and all mere temporary variations, such as size, albinism, etc., the more permanent varieties are generally found, as far as I can discover, inhabiting distinct stations, such as high land or low land, dry or moist districts. Moreover, in the case of animals which wander much about and cross freely, their varieties seem to be generally confined to distinct regions.|$|E

60|$|So long as {{national}} feeling exists, {{it is very}} important that each nation should be self-governing as regards its internal affairs. Government can only be carried on by force and tyranny if its subjects view it with hostile eyes, and they will so view it if they feel that it belongs to an alien nation. This principle meets with difficulties in cases where men of different nations <b>live</b> <b>side</b> by side in the same area, as happens in some parts of the Balkans. There are also difficulties in regard to places which, for some geographical reason, are of great international importance, such as the Suez Canal and the Panama Canal. In such cases the purely local desires of the inhabitants may have to give way before larger interests. But in general, at any rate as applied to civilized communities, the principle that the boundaries of nations ought to coincide with the boundaries of states has very few exceptions.|$|E

But the past and secret trouble left its mark on both. Leonard became sterner, more silent, watchful, and suspicious. Juanna grew suddenly from a girl into a woman of presence and great natural dignity. She did not often laugh during those months as had been her wont, she only smiled, sadly enough at times. Her thoughts would not let her laugh, for they were of what her life might have been had no such person as Jane Beach existed, and of {{what it must be}} because of Jane Beach. Indeed this unknown Jane took a great hold of her mind--she haunted her. Juanna pictured her in a dozen different shapes of beauty, endowed with many varying charms, and hated each phantasm worse than the last.|$|E

As yet we are mortal, and to <b>live</b> <b>side</b> by side with one another would be dreadful, for somehow with you I cannot long be trivial, and, you know, to be always beyond this mortal state would be to lose it. If people marry, they must live together as affectionate humans, who may be commonplace with each other without feeling awkward--not as two souls. So I feel it.|$|E
