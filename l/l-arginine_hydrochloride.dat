Mineral salt broth (MSB) medium (0.5 L) and <b>L-arginine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (10 g) were placed in a 2.8-L Fernbach flask fitted with an air inlet tube and a vapor bulb extended through the closure of the flask mouth. The flask, fittings, and contents were sterilized in an autoclave. After cooling, the previously prepared flask of inoculum was transferred to the Fernbach flask using aseptic technique. The vapor bulb was charged with chlorobenzene (10 mL), and the flask was shaken on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm and 30° for 48 hours. The vapor bulb with excess chlorobenzene was removed, and the pH of the aqueous contents of the flask was measured and adjusted to pH ~9 if necessary. The aqueous mixture was divided equally into centrifuge tubes and the solids were separated by centrifugation for 30 minutes at ~8,000 rpm. The aqueous supernatant was decanted, combined, saturated with NaCl, and extracted with EtOAc (4 × 100 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried (Na2SO4 or MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure, giving 190 mg of a tan colored solid. Centrifugation was used to aid breaking of any emulsions observed with the organic extracts.

A number of micro-organisms were screened to test their ability to form and accumulate l-citrulline from l-arginine. Pseudomonas putida was selected as the best organism. With this organism, enzyme activity as high as 9. 20 units per ml could be produced by a shaking culture at 30 C in a medium containing glucose, ammonium phosphate, <b>l-arginine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> yeast extract, peptone, and inorganic salts. Appropriate addition of a surface active agent to the reaction mixture was found to shorten the time required for the conversion. A large amount of <b>l-arginine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> was converted stoichiometrically to l-citrulline in 62 hr at 37 C.

Accordingly, an arginine derivative monomer; Arginine Methyl Ester Methacrylamide (AMME) was synthesized by the reaction of an active ester monomer, pentafluorophenylmethacrylate (PFMA) and the <b>L-arginine</b> methyl ester <b>hydrochloride</b> (AME) {{in the presence of}} excess triethyl amine. AMME was then polymerized via both conventional free radical polymerization and reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The polymers p(AMME) were characterized via nuclear magnetic resonance and gel permeation chromatography techniques. The conventional free radical polymerization experiments yielded polymers with uncontrolled molecular weights and wide molecular weight distribution, whereas RAFT polymerizations performed both in aqueous solution and organic solvent yielded polymers with controlled molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions. The RAFT polymerization kinetic experiments showed the RAFT-controlled character of AMME polymerization in the presence of 4 -cyano- 4 -(ethylthiocarbonylthioylthio) sulfanylpentanoic acid (ECT) as a RAFT agent. The cytotoxicity of P(AMME) before and after aminolysis was determined via MTT assay using A 549 human lung cancer cell line. P(AMME) before aminolysis of the RAFT end-group displayed dose-dependent toxicity after 24 hours incubation with cells. It was highly toxic to cells at 25 μM concentration, killing almost more than 60 % of cells after 24 hours incubation. On the other hand, the aminolyzed polymer has no significant toxicity in the concentration range studied (upto 500 μM), which was comparable with octaarginine, a widely used transfection agent. In conclusion, well-defined arginine-polymers synthesized in this study show potential for further investigations as potential components of intracellular delivery systems for therapeutics...|$|R
40|$|Esta Tese teve como objetivo o estudo por meio de espectroscopia Rama de dois cristais contendo o aminoÃcido L-arginina em sua constituiÃÃo: a L-arginina monohidratada clorohidrato (LARHCL) e a L-arginina dihidratada (LARDH). Na primeira parte do trabalho foram discutidos aspectos estruturais gerais da LARHCL e da LARDH, em {{particular}} a distribuiÃÃo dos modos normais do material em termos das representaÃÃes irredutÃveis do grupos fatores C 2 e D 2, respectivamente. Foi realizado um estudo detalhado dos modos normais de vibraÃÃo da LARHCL Ã temperatura ambiente atravÃs de espesctroscopia Raman polarizada observando-se os modos normais de vibraÃÃo do material em nove diferentes geometrias de espalhamento. Com o auxÃlio de cÃlculo âab initioâ foi feita a classificaÃÃo tentativa dos modos normais de vibraÃÃo da LARHCL ativos no Raman. Numa outra etapa do trabalho analisou-se os espectros Raman da LARDH sob diversas condiÃÃes de temperatura e de pressÃo. Realizou-se um estudo dos modos normais do cristal de LARDH atravÃs da espectroscopia Raman no intervalo entre 300 e 2000 C. Deste estudo observou-se a existÃncia de algumas anomalias nos espectros Raman, como mudanÃa de inclinaÃÃo de curvas dw/dT para modos de baixa frequÃncia em torno de 45 oC, alÃm do fato de que a partir de 50 oC algumas bandas vÃo perdendo intensidade. Estes fatos foram interpretados como uma transiÃÃo de fase sofrida pelo cristal entre 45 o e 50 oC. Observou-se que os espectros Raman entre 450 e 60 oC eram diferentes dos espectros Raman para T 60 oC sugerindo a coexistÃncia de fases neste intervalo de temperatura. Uma outra hipÃtese foi que o cristal sofreria uma transiÃÃo de fase em 45 oC, ficando nesta fase atÃ a temperatura de 60 oC. Foram realizadas medidas tÃrmicas do tipo anÃlise tÃrmica diferencial (DTA) e anÃlise termogravimÃtrica (TG). Da anÃlise de DTA observou-se que entre 45 o e 50 oC comeÃa um evento endotÃrmico que se prolonga atÃ cerca de 84 oC. A seguir, um segundo evento endotÃrmico se inicia, prolongando-se atÃ 109 oC. Com o auxÃlio das medidas de TG compreendeu-se que estes dois eventos endotÃrmicos estÃo associados Ã expulsÃo das molÃculas de Ãgua, embora uma pequena quantidade permaneÃa no cristal como demonstrado pela espectroscopia Raman. Como parte final do trabalho estudou-se cristais de LARDH sob condiÃÃes de altas pressÃes atÃ cerca de 8 GPa. Deste estudo inferiu-se pela anÃlise da regiÃo dos modos externos, que o cristal sofre uma transiÃÃo de fase em torno de 2, 5 GPa. Entretanto, para pressÃes no intervalo entre 2, 5 e 8, 0 GPa nenhuma outra transiÃÃo de fase foi percebida, o que aponta para uma grande estabilidade do cristal quando comparado a outros cristais hidratados de aminoÃcidos. AlÃm disso, nas regiÃes dos modos internos nÃo foram observadas grandes mudanÃas nos espectros Raman, sugerindo que a transiÃÃo de fase com a pressÃo seja do tipo conformacional. The {{objective of}} this Thesis is the study through Raman spectroscopy of two crystals containing amino acid L-arginine: <b>L-arginine</b> monohydrated <b>hydrochloride</b> (LARHCL) and <b>L-arginine</b> dihidrated (LARDH). In {{the first part of}} the work it was presented structural and vibrational aspects of LARHCL and LARDH, particularly the distribution of normal modes in terms of the irreducible representations of factor groups C 2 and D 2, respectively. The room temperature normal modes of LARHCL observed through polarized Raman spectroscopy using nine different scattering geometries was presented. Using ab initio calculations it was possible to tentatively assign the Raman-active normal modes of LARHCL. In another part of the work it is presented the analysis of Raman spectra of LARDH under several temperature and pressure conditions. It was studied the normal modes of LARDH crystal through Raman spectroscopy in the range between 30 oC and 200 oC. From this study it was observed the occurrence of anomalies in the Raman spectra, such as change in the curves dw/dT related to modes of low frequency (at about 45 oC), as well as the fact that, starting from 50 oC, in a heating process, some bands decrease intensity. Such a picture suggested that LARDH crystal undergoes a phase transition between 45 o and 50 oC. Also, it was possible to note that the spectra recorded between 45 o and 60 oC were different from those recorded for T 60 oC suggesting the coexistence of phases in this temperature interval. Another hypothesis was that the crystal undergoes a phase transition at 45 oC, remaining in this phase up to the temperature of 60 oC. Additionally, it was possible to perform thermal analysis measurements, differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG). From the DTA it was observed that between 45 o and 50 oC begins an endothermic event that is observed up to 84 oC. A second endothermic event begins and remains up to 109 oC. By using TG data it was possible to understand that these two events are related to water that left the crystal, although a small quantity remains in the crystal, as pointed out by Raman spectroscopy. In the final part of the work LARDH crystal under high pressure conditions was studied up to 8 GPa. From this study, in particular the analysis of external modes, it was revealed that the crystal undergoes a phase transition at ~ 2, 5 GPa. However, for pressures between 2, 5 and 8, 0 GPa no additional phase transition was observed, pointing to a great stability of the crystal when compared with other amino acid hydrated crystals. Additionally, there is no great change in the internal mode region of the Raman spectrum, suggesting that the phase transition undergone by LARDH under high pressure conditions can be classified as a conformational one...|$|R

30|$|The {{administration}} of <b>l-arginine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> {{has been used}} for testing pituitary secretion in humans, and as an experimental model for induction of acute pancreatitis in rats and mice. Whereas in the first case, the {{administration of}} the amino acid is associated with hiperkalemia, in the model of acute pancreatitis no data are available on possible changes in potassium homeostasis. The present study shows that the acute administration to mice of <b>l-arginine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> or other cationic amino acids almost duplicate plasma potassium levels. This effect was associated to a marked decrease of tissue potassium in both pancreas and liver. No changes were found in other tissues. These changes cannot be ascribed to the large load of chloride ions, since similar effects were produced when l-ornithine aspartate was administered. The changes in potassium levels were dependent on the dose. The displacement of intracellular potassium from the liver and pancreas to the extracellular compartment appears to be dependent on the entry of the cationic amino acid, since the administration of an equivalent dose of alfa-difluoromethyl ornithine HCl (DFMO), a non physiological analog of l-ornithine, which is poorly taken by the tissues in comparison with the physiological cationic amino acids, did not produce any change in potassium levels in pancreas and liver. The analyses of the expression of cationic amino acid transporters (CAT) suggest that the CAT- 2 transporter may be implicated in the potassium/cationic amino acid interchange in liver and pancreas. The possible physiological or pathological relevance of these findings is discussed.|$|E

Materials and methods. 20 patients with AH stage II and co-existent COPD in remission phase without respiratory failure with the average age of 48 ± 3. 9 years (males to females = 1 : 1) suffering from pulmonary hypertension of bronchopulmonary genesis (the main group) who received L-arginine and 10 patients of corresponding age and gender who were injected a solution of 0. 9 % sodium chloride (the control group) were included in the study. Intravenous infusions (4. 2 % <b>L-arginine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> and saline solutions) were performed once using acute drug testing at the rate of 10 drops per minute within the first 10 minutes and increasing the drip rate by 15 drops per minute. Results. An expressive hypotensive effect in case of acute administration of L-arginine in the systemic circulation during the infusion and over the next 24 hours with a reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure was noted.

Optimization of the {{diabetic}} nephropathy (DN) treatment {{in association with}} hypertonic disease (HD) based {{on the study of}} neutrophil chain of pathogenic cellular mechanisms of these diseases development and the special features of its clinical course. Materials and methods. There were complexly examined 86 patients with HD associated with DN and 30 patients with isolated HD. The control group was formed by 30 practically healthy persons. The activity of NO-synthases in neutrophils was detected by Green colorimetric methods using Griess reagent. The expression of ІСАМ- 1 (CD 54), CD 11 b-integrin and inducible NO-synthase on neutrophils was detected by the indirect immunocytochemical method. Oxygen-depending activity of neutrophils was assessed in NBT-test. Results. Expression of adhesive molecules of CD 54 and CD 11 b-integrin on neutrophils of peripheral blood essentially increases (р < 0, 001) in patients with DN in association with HD comparing with isolated HD and the control group. At associated pathology on the background of high oxygen-depending activity of neutrophils its functional reserve decreases that results in intensification of inflammatory processes in kidneys (р< 0, 001). In comorbid patients chronization of pathological process results in imbalance of NO-synthases system in neutrophils: on the background of decrease of activity of constituent NO-synthases the expression and activity of inducible NO-synthase increase (р< 0, 001). The use of <b>L-arginine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> in the complex therapy of patients with DN associated with HD intensifies organoprotective effect of basal therapy, results in facilitation of the clinical course, decreases albuminuria, corrects the functional indices of neutrophils and diminishes imbalance in NO-synthases system.

The research was carried out on rats weighting 120 - 150 g that were divided into five research groups: Group I included animals with iodine deficiency (the comparison group, n= 30); Group II comprised animals with combined iodine and iron deficiencies (n= 30); Group III included animals with correction of combined iodine and iron deficiencies using iodine-containing drugs (potassium iodide, n= 30); Group IV comprised animals with correction of combined iodine and iron deficiencies using iodine-containing drugs and iron hydroxide (n= 30); Group V consisted of animals with correction of combined iodine and iron deficiencies using iodine, iron, antioxidants, nitric oxide donators (n= 30). In order to induce iodine deficiency all animals were kept on iodine-deficient diet for 45 days and received merkazolil with drinking water (7. 5 mg/ 100 g body weight). Iron deficiency was induced by daily intraperitoneal injection of chelator deferoxamine at a dose of 20 mg/ 100 g body weight since 31 st to 45 th days of the experiment. The correction {{was carried out by}} addition of potassium iodide (50 mg daily for 30 days), iron hydroxide (2. 5 mg daily for 20 days), alpha-tocopherol acetate (20 mg daily for 30 days), <b>L-arginine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (2. 5 g daily for 20 days) to diet. The control group consisted of 30 animals, which received intraperitoneal injection of physiologic solution (0. 2 ml/ 100 g body weight) since 31 st to 45 th days of the experiment. Iodine deficiency and combined microelement deficiency were found to be accompanied by impaired thyroid profile as indicated by a decrease in serum levels of free triiodothyronine (fT 3) and thyroxine (fT 4) on the background of increased TSH. In animals with iodine deficiency the activation of lipid peroxidation, the suppression of most studied antioxidant enzymes (excluding the catalase and glutathione peroxidase the levels of which increased) and the development of dyslipidemia were observed. Iron deficiency negatively affected prooxidant-antioxidant homeostasis in rats, potentiated changes in blood lipid spectrum that could significantly increase the risk for the development of disturbances associated with goiter. The correction of revealed changes was effective when using potassium iodide.

This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether the alterations in vascular function and structure after balloon injury in hypercholesterolemic rabbits could be inhibited by dietary arginine. Background. Administration of arginine (the nitric oxide [NO] precursor) restores vascular NO activity in hypercholesterolemic animals. We and other investigators have shown that enhancement of vascular NO activity can inhibit myointimal hyperplasia after vascular injury in normocholesterolemic animals. Methods. Twenty-eight New Zealand White rabbits received either normal rabbit chow, 0. 5 % cholesterol diet or 0. 5 % cholesterol diet plus <b>l-arginine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (2. 25 % wt/vol) in the drinking water. After 6 weeks of dietary intervention, the left iliac artery of each animal was subjected to a balloon injury. Four weeks later, the iliac arteries were harvested for vascular reactivity studies and immunohistochemical analysis. Results. Vascular injury induced intimal thickening that was largely composed of vascular smooth muscle cells and extracellular matrix. In the setting of hypercholesterolemia, vascular injury induced an exuberant myointimal lesion that was augmented by the accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages. Dietary arginine reduced intimal thickening in the injured vessels of hypercholesterolemic animals and substantially inhibited the accumulation of macrophages in the lesion (from 28 % to 5 % of the lesion area, p < 0. 001). Conclusions. We report that lesions induced by vascular injury in hypercholesterolemic animals are markedly reduced by oral administration of arginine. Moreover, we find that the nature of the lesion is altered, with a striking reduction in the percentage of macrophages comprising the lesion...|$|E
40|$|In {{skeletal}} muscle, 4 h of ischemia {{followed by}} 30 min of reperfusion depolarizes the fibers, markedly increases the Cl- and glibenclamide-sensitive K+ conductances {{and reduces the}} excitability of the fibers. The ischemia-reperfusion also significantly decreases the ATP content of the muscles. In the present work, the electrical parameters of reperfused extensor digitorum longus muscle of rats were measured in vitro at 30 Â°C, by a computerized two-intracellular microelectrode technique, before and after in vivo pretreatment with equimolar doses of phosphocreatine disodium salt tetrahydrate, phosphocreatine di-l-arginine salt and <b>l-arginine</b> <b>hydrochloride.</b> In the same experimental situations the ATP content of the muscles was also measured. Both phosphocreatine salts prevented the increase of membrane ion conductance due to muscle reperfusion by preloading the muscle fibers with extra ATP. Phosphocreatine disodium salt also prevented the depolarization and restored the normal excitability of the reperfused fibers. In contrast, phosphocreatine di-l-arginine salt did not restore the resting potential nor the excitability of the fibers, but it decreased the amplitude of the action potential by reducing the overshoot. The pretreatment with l-arginine also failed to protect the electrical parameters of the fibers from the ischemic-reperfusion insult. Furthermore, the l-amino acid produced a more pronounced reduction of the excitability of the fibers by increasing the threshold current needed to elicit an action potential and reducing its overshoot. The in vitro application of l-arginine to the muscle also reduced the overshoot of the action potential, suggesting a direct interaction of the l-amino acid with Na+ channels. Â© 1995...|$|E
40|$|<b>L-Arginine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> {{is a very}} {{important}} aggregation suppressor for which there has been much attention given regarding elucidating its mechanism of action. Little consideration, however, has been given toward other salt forms besides chloride, even though the counterion likely imparts a large influence per the Hofmeister Series. Here, we report an in depth analysis of the role the counterion plays in the aggregation suppression behavior of arginine. Consistent with the empirical Hofmeister series, we found that the aggregation suppression ability of other arginine salt forms on a model protein (α-chymotrypsinogen) follows the order: H[subscript 2]PO[subscript 4][superscript –] > SO[subscript 4][superscript 2 –] > citratep[superscript 2 –] > acetate[superscript –] ≈ F[superscript –] ≈ Cl[superscript –] > Br[superscript –] > I[superscript –] ≈ SCN[superscript –]. Mechanistically, preferential interaction and osmotic virial coefficient measurements, in addition to molecular dynamics simulations, indicate that attractive ion–ion interactions, particularly attractive interactions between arginine molecules, play a dominate role in the observed behavior. Furthermore, it appears that dihydrogen phosphate, sulfate, and citrate have strong attractive interactions with the guanidinium group of arginine, which seems to contribute to the superior aggregation suppression ability of those salt forms by bridging together multiple arginine molecules into clusters. These results not only further our understanding of how arginine influences protein stability, they also help to elucidate the mechanism behind the Hofmeister Series. This should help to improve biopharmaceutical stabilization through the use of other arginine salts and possibly, the development of novel excipients.

40|$|Purpose: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that L-arginine (the substrate for nitric oxide synthase [NOS]) administration slows the VO 2 kinetics {{at the onset of}} moderate-intensity exercise in human. Methods: Seven physically active males were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (lactose) or <b>L-arginine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> capsules (7. 2 g. d(- 1)) for 14 d in a double-blind crossover design, with a 7 -d washout period between the two conditions. On day 11 and day 14 of each condition. the subjects completed two consecutive 6 -min boots of cycle exercise at 80 % of the ventilatory threshold with a 12 -min rest interval. VO 2 was measured on a breath-by-breath basis. and VO 2 kinetics were determined with a single exponential model from the averaged data derived from four repetitions. Capillary and venous blood samples were taken to determine plasma [La] and serum [arginine], respectively. Results: There were no differences in circulating lactate either before or during exercise. However, serum [arginine] was higher (P < 0. 05) in the arginine condition at rest (119. 0 +/- 12. 6 vs 103. 6 +/- 15. 7 mu mol. L- 1 in the control condition) and after exercise (113. 3 +/- 26. 0 vs, 103. 8 +/- 12. 6 mu mol. L- 1 in the control condition). With regard to the pulmonary VO 2 kinetics, no significant difference was observed in the time at which the phase II response emerged or in the phase II amplitude between the two conditions. However, contrary to our hypothesis, the time constant was significantly reduced after arginine administration (i. e., 13. 9 +/- 3. 1 vs 15. 8 +/- 2. 6 s in the control condition, (P <= 0. 014).

The present study evaluated the acute effect of L-arginine supplementation on indicators of NO production, nitrite (NO 2 -) [*]+[*]nitrate (NO 3 -) (NOx), in healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) have also been addressed. Seventeen healthy males participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Blood samples were drawn from a left antecubital vein at baseline (T 0). Afterwards, subjects were randomly submittedto 6 [*]g of oral L-arginine supplementation (as <b>L-arginine</b> <b>hydrochloride)</b> or placebo (as corn starch); afterwards, the subjects remained at rest in supine position and blood samples were drawn again at 30 (T 1), 60 (T 2), 90 (T 3) and 120 minutes (T 4) after supplementation. To analyze NO production, NO 3 - was converted to NO 2 - by nitrate reductase, followed by the derivatization of NO 2 - with 2, 3 -diaminonaphthalene. NOx, ADMA and SDMA were analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography system and monitored with a fluorescence detector. Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures showed no significant changes in NOx concentrations on the L-arginine group as compared to placebo group at any of the fivetime points (T 0 : 17. 6 [*]±[*] 3. 9 vs 14. 6 [*]±[*] 2. 3 [*]μmol/L; T 1 : 15. 8 [*]±[*] 2. 4 vs 14. 3 [*]±[*] 1. 7 [*]μmol/L; T 2 : 16. 8 [*]±[*] 4. 9 vs 13. 7 [*]±[*] 2. 7 [*]μmol/L; T 3 : 16. 7 [*]±[*] 3. 9 vs 14. 6 [*]±[*] 2. 1 [*]μmol/L; T 4 : 15. 1 [*]±[*] 2. 8 vs 13. 5 [*]±[*] 3. 5 [*]μmol/L). Furthermore, plasma levels of ADMA and SDMA were not statistically significant between the L-arginine and placebo groups at T 0 (0. 43 [*]±[*] 0. 19 vs 0. 39 [*]±[*] 0. 15 [*]μmol/L and 1. 83 [*]±[*] 1. 13 vs 1. 70 [*]±[*] 0. 62 [*]μmol/L), respectively.

In addition, we evaluated whether a loading dose of L-arginine triggers an acute migraine headache in migraineurs. Subjects and methods: Twenty healthy subjects and 20 migraine patients participated in a 2 -period, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Each subject received a 30 -min infusion, by peripheral vein, of 30 [*]g <b>L-arginine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> or placebo (i. e. an equal volume of 0. 9 % saline solution). Meanwhile, biomarkers associated with the L-arginine-NO pathway (i. e. exhaled NO/nasal NO), plasma citrulline and urinary excretion of nitrite/nitrate and cGMP were assessed before and for 6 [*]h following {{the start of the}} infusion. Results: At baseline, exhaled NO and nasal NO were higher in migraineurs compared to healthy subjects (mean[*]±[*] 95 % confidence interval) : 15. 9 (8. 8, 23. 0) parts per billion (ppb) versus 10. 8 (7. 0, 14. 5) ppb for exhaled NO (P[*]=[*] 0. 04) and 76. 3 (61. 2, 91. 4) versus 61. 6 (51. 2, 72. 0) ppb for nasal NO (P[*]=[*] 0. 03), respectively. The AUC(0 - 6) in ppb for exhaled NO and nasal NO following L-arginine or saline infusion did not differ between both groups. The increase in L-citrulline, following L-arginine infusion, was smaller in migraine patients (15 (13, 18) µmol/l) compared to healthy volunteers (19 (16, 23) µmol/l; P[*]=[*] 0. 046). In healthy subjects, both nitrate and cGMP excretion were higher following L-arginine compared to placebo infusion: 132. 63 (100. 24, 165. 02) versus 92. 07 (66. 33, 117. 82) µmol/mmol creatinine for nitrate (P[*]=[*] 0. 014) and 50. 53 (42. 19, 58. 87) versus 39. 64 (33. 94, 45. 34) nmol/mmol creatinine for cGMP (P[*]=[*] 0. 0003), respectively. In migraineurs, excretion of these biomarkers was comparable following L-arginine or saline infusion. Conclusions: The {{results of the present study}} do not support the idea of a generalised increase in NO synthase activity in migraine patients outside of a migraine attack. The smaller increase in plasma L-citrulline, urinary nitrate and cGMP excretion following L-arginine infusion in migraine patients might indicate dysfunction of endothelial NO synthase. status: publishe...|$|E
