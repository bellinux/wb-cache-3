In a promotional in-ring segment on the episode of Friday Night SmackDown! before the pay-per-view event, Khali and Hornswoggle weighed in for their match, in which Khali weighed double the weight of Hornswoggle; this was a segment created by McMahon to humiliate his son.

Akin asks Mary to go to his mother's house in Abuja, Akin also finds himself in Mary's Father's house which is a very ancient house. Mary's sister, Cynthia (Ada Ameh) introduces Akin to their father (Chika Okpala) as Mary's boyfriend. Mary is also received happily by Akin's mother, Kike (Joke Silva) and she believed Mary is Akin's girlfriend. Mary tries to explain to her what happened, but she is too overjoyed to listen. Akin finds it hard to adapt to the life in the Village: He asks the family for a cutlery to eat 'swallow' food and he is laughed at, He is also unable to sleep with the others on bed and goes to sleep on the veranda. He finds it hard to sleep on the Veranda again due to mosquitoes. He gets up and calls Mary instead and they get to discuss many things <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> her sister's sin is that she beats her husband and she's accused of pulling her husband's penis this time around. Mary asks Akin to speak to Cynthia on her behalf because she thinks Cynthia will listen to him as Cynthia seems to like him. Akin also asks Mary to go to the company's retreat on his behalf. He tells her that all she needs to do is give the chairman the information on the memory card of his phone. Akin talks to Cynthia and she accepts to behave responsibly at the family meeting and to start behaving responsibly at home in order to preserve the future of her kids. At the meeting she kneels down for the Elders and apologizes to everyone in a sober state and eventually bursts into tears.|$|E

500|$|When Edward II succeeded {{his father}} Edward I on 7 July 1307, the {{attitude}} of his subjects was generally one of goodwill toward their new king. However, discontent was brewing beneath the surface. Some of {{this was due to}} existing problems left behind by the late king, while much was due to the new king's inadequacies. The problems were threefold. First there was discontent with the royal [...] policy for financing wars. To finance the war in Scotland, Edward I had increasingly resorted to so-called prises [...] or purveyance [...] to provision the troops with victuals. Though a perfectly legitimate method of raising money, the peers felt that the purveyance had become far too burdensome and compensation was in many cases inadequate or missing entirely. In addition, they did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Edward II took prises for his household without continuing the war effort against Scotland, causing the second problem. While Edward I had spent the last decade of his reign relentlessly campaigning against the Scots, his son abandoned the war almost entirely. In this situation, the Scottish king Robert Bruce soon took the opportunity to regain what had been lost. This not only exposed the north of England to Scottish attacks, but also jeopardized the possessions of the English baronage in Scotland.|$|E

500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{declared}} [...] "Greg Pikitis" [...] one of {{the episodes}} he would suggest to newcomers seeking {{to become familiar with}} Parks and Recreation, calling it [...] "the version of Parks and Recreation that I most enjoy: silly, but also intentionally small in scale". He particularly praised Louis CK and some of the smaller jokes in the episode, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> a gay character's [...] "straight guy" [...] Halloween costume is identical to Mark's regular wardrobe. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said the episode [...] "demonstrated how an episode of P can work wonders—dial up the conditions that might drive a character insane, as they did to Leslie, and watch them squirm". He also said the episode featured every supporting character well, but that Ann was less funny without a [...] "wacky person to play off of". Time magazine critic James Poniewozik said it was a [...] "strong episode that hit office and personal sides of the characters equally well". Poniewozik praised Pratt and Louis C.K. in particular, but also said Leslie was pushed [...] "a little too far into the crazy-obsessive end of the spectrum". Not all reviews were positive. Linda Stasi of New York Post said the episode was [...] "a big yawn", although she praised the performance of Cody Klop as Greg Pikitis.|$|E

In 2008, she {{starred in the}} Doctor Who episode [...] "Midnight", playing an intergalactic Hostess alongside David Tennant's Tenth Doctor. In 2009, Ayola starred in the CBBC musical comedy My Almost Famous Family. She stated: [...] "The script made me laugh out loud when I read it. [...] I also <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> {{there were a lot}} of correct boxes being ticked, but the writers and producer haven't been restrained by that. [...] "So, instead of bowing to this altar, they've said, 'Okay, we have this family that's half-black, half-white, half-American, half-British. We have a mix of boys and girls, one character who's mixed-raced and deaf – but we're not going to be restrained by any of that. We're not going to tiptoe around Martha's disability or anything.'

500|$|Nigel {{was active}} in {{draining}} the Fens, the swampy land around Ely, to increase the agricultural lands around his bishopric. He also fortified the Isle of Ely with stone defences, probably starting around 1140. The remains of one castle on Cherry Hill in Ely probably date to Nigel's fortifications. Early in his time as bishop he {{was active in}} recovering lands of the church that had been granted to knights by his predecessors, and soon after his consecration he ordered an inquest made into the lands actually owned by the diocese and cathedral chapter. The bishop {{spent most of his}} life in debt, but in the year he died he managed to clear it with his son's help. The monks of his cathedral chapter did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> they were required to pay for the bishop's appeals to Rome to recover his see, or pay for regaining the king's favour. Their dislike of their bishop is evident in the Liber Eliensis. The art historian C. R. Dodwell wrote of Nigel's efforts: When.... Nigel... needed to raise money in order to repair his own political fortunes, he stripped down, sold, or used as security, a quite astounding number of Ely's monastic treasures. These numbered Crucifixes of gold and silver from the Anglo-Saxon past, and they included an alb with gold-embroidered apparels, given by St Æthelwold, and a chasuble, given by King Edgar, which was almost all of gold. [...] A gold and bejewelled textile covering... was sold to the Bishop of Lincoln, Alexander, who took it with him to Rome as a gift of particular splendour. [...] It is a biting commentary on attitudes of the Anglo-Norman episcopy to Anglo-Saxon art, that it was left to the pope to point out that such an artistic heirloom should never have left Ely in the first place and to order its return.|$|E
