60|$|A louse crawled {{over the}} nape of his neck and, putting his thumb and {{forefinger}} deftly beneath his <b>loose</b> <b>collar,</b> he caught it. He rolled its body, tender yet brittle as a grain of rice, between thumb and finger for an instant before he let it fall from him and wondered would it live or die. There came to his mind a curious phrase from CORNELIUS A LAPIDE which said that the lice born of human sweat were not created by God with the other animals on the sixth day. But the tickling of the skin of his neck made his mind raw and red. The life of his body, ill clad, ill fed, louse-eaten, made him close his eyelids in a sudden spasm of despair and in the darkness he saw the brittle bright bodies of lice falling from the air and turning often as they fell. Yes, and it was not darkness that fell from the air. It was brightness.|$|E
60|$|It was too much. The united {{force of}} truth and slander and insult put over heavy a strain on Tom Yorkfield’s powers of restraint. In his right hand he held a useful oak cudgel, with his left he made a grab at the <b>loose</b> <b>collar</b> of Laurence’s canary-coloured silk shirt. Laurence was not a {{fighting}} man; the fear of physical violence threw him off his balance as completely as overmastering indignation had thrown Tom off his, and thus it came to pass that Clover Fairy was regaled with the unprecedented sight {{of a human being}} scudding and squawking across the enclosure, like the hen that would persist in trying to establish a nesting-place in the manger. In another crowded happy moment the bull was trying to jerk Laurence over his left shoulder, to prod him in the ribs while still in the air, and to kneel on him when he reached the ground. It was only the vigorous intervention of Tom that induced him to relinquish the last item of his programme.|$|E

[...] The boy stared at him, slowly taking in the facts of his costume, with eyes that climbed from the heavy shoes up the legs of his thick-ribbed {{stockings}} and his knickerbockers, past the pleats and belt of his Norfolk jacket, to the red neckcloth tied under the <b>loose</b> <b>collar</b> of his flannel outing-shirt, and so by his face, with its soft, young beard and its quiet eyes, {{to the top of}} his braidless, bandless slouch hat of soft felt. It was one of the earliest costumes of the kind that had shown itself in the hill country, and it was altogether new to the boy. [...] "Come," [...] said the wearer of it, [...] "don't stand on the order of your going, but go at once," [...] and {{he sat down on the}} steps with his back to the boy, who heard these strange terms of command with a face of vague envy.|$|E

40|$|Background: Functional brace {{application}} for isolated humeral shaft fracture persistently yields good results. Nonunion though uncommon involves usually the proximal third shaft fractures. Instead of polyethylene bivalve functional brace four plaster sleeves wrapped and molded {{with little more}} proximal extension expected to prevent nonunion of proximal third fractures. Periodic compressibility of the cast is likely to yield a better result. This can be applied on the 1 st day of the presentation as an outpatient basis. Comprehensive objective scoring system befitting for fracture humeral shaft is a need. Materials and Methods: Sixty six (male = 40, female = 26) unilateral humeral shaft fractures of mean age 34. 4 years (range 11 - 75 years) involving 38 left and 28 right hands were {{included in this study}} during April 2008 to December 2012. Fractures involved proximal (n = 18), mid (n = 35) and distal (n = 13) of humerus. Transverse, oblique, comminuted and spiral orientations in 18, 35 and 13 patients respectively. One had segmental fracture and three had a pathological fracture with cystic bone lesion. Mechanisms of injuries as identified in this study were road traffic accidents 57. 6 % (n = 38), fall 37. 9 % (n = 25). 12. 1 % (n = 8) had radial nerve palsy 7. 6 % (n = 5) had Type I open fracture. Four plaster strips of 12 layers and 5 - 7. 5 cm broad depending on the girth of arm were prepared. Arm was then wrapped with single layer compressed cotton. Lateral and medial strips were applied and then after molding anterior and posterior strips were applied {{in such a way that}} permits full elbow range of motion and partial abduction of the shoulder. Care was taken to prevent adherence of one strip with other except in the proximal end. Limb was then put in <b>loose</b> <b>collar</b> and cuff sling intermittently allowing active motion of the elbow ROM and pendular movement of the shoulder. Weekly tightening of the cast by fresh layers of bandage over the existing cast brace continued. Results: The results were assessed using 100 point scoring system where union allotted 30 points and 60 points allotted for angulations (10), elbow motion (10), shoulder abduction (10), shortening (5), rotation (5), absence of infection (10), absence of nerve palsy during treatment (10). Remaining 10 points were allotted for five items with two points each. They were the absence of skin sore, absence of vascular problem, absence of reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), recovery of paralyzed nerve during injury and recovery of paralyzed nerve during treatment. Results were considered excellent with 90 and above, good with 80 - 89, fair with 70 - 79 and poor below 70 point. Results at 6 months were excellent in 43. 94 % (n = 29), good in 42. 42 % (n = 28), fair in 9. 1 % (n = 6), poor in 4. 55 % (n = 3). Union took place in 98. 48 % (n = 65) with an average of 10. 3 weeks (range 6 - 16 weeks). 87. 5 % (n = 7) paralyzed radial nerve recovered. All wounds healed. Four patients had transient skin problem. One patient with mid shaft fracture had nonunion due to the muscle interposition. Conclusion: Modified functional cast brace is one of the options in treatment for humeral shaft fractures as it can be applied on the 1 st day of the presentation in most of the situations. Simple objective scoring system was useful particularly in uneducated patients...|$|E

50|$|Martingale collars (also called limited-slip collars) {{are usually}} made of flat nylon {{with a smaller}} fixed-length section (made of either nylon or a short length of chain) that, when pulled on by the leash, shortens up {{tightening}} the collar around the dog's neck, to a limited extent.

50|$|Neck strap. A simple narrow {{leather strap}} buckled around a horse's neck to give {{security}} to jockeys and other riders. Up until several years it was only used by beginner riders, but has now become popular with jockeys who ride with a very short stirrup leather. Another form of neck strap (or rope) is the one used by cowboys when roping. This style is shorter and placed closer to the horse's head with the lariat passing through it, {{in order to keep}} the horse facing the calf after it has been roped. It also refers to the part of a martingale, which buckles around the horse's neck. A <b>loose</b> neck <b>collar</b> is also used on harness racing horses when the reins are passed through it.|$|R

5000|$|They {{were the}} first English manifestation of the formalised artistic [...] "brotherhood", an artistic {{movement}} whose aims included elements of communal living and promotion of a general vision for society. Continental groups of this sort included the German Nazarene movement and the Barbus in Paris, and the most successful later English example {{was to be the}} Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Like these groups they represented an oppositional break-away from the academic art establishment, and looked back to an idealized version of the past. They pursued equality among their members as a reaction to the hierarchical structure of the conventional art world. Like Nazarenes and Barbus, they promoted the wearing of special revivalist costume, though only Palmer seems often to have worn it in practice; it seems to be shown in some portraits of Palmer by Richmond such as the bust-length miniature and chalk drawing (1829, both National Portrait Gallery), which shows a round-necked pleated smock under a coat with a <b>loose</b> untidy <b>collar</b> and lapels, combined with somewhat Christ-like long hair and a beard. [...] The Ancients were probably aware of the Nazarenes, but probably not of the Barbus.|$|R
60|$|Bittridge, {{with his}} {{overcoat}} hanging on his arm, advanced towards {{him with the}} rest, and continued to advance, {{in a sort of}} fascination, after his neighbors, with the instinct that something was about to happen, parted on either side of Richard, and left the two men confronted. Richard did not speak, but deliberately reached out his left hand, which he caught securely into Bittridge's collar; then he began to beat him with the cowhide wherever he could strike his writhing and twisting shape. Neither uttered a word, and except for the whir of the cowhide in the air, and the rasping sound of its arrest upon the body of Bittridge, the thing was done in perfect silence. The witnesses stood well back in a daze, from which they recovered when Richard released Bittridge with a twist of the hand that tore his <b>collar</b> <b>loose</b> and left his cravat dangling, and tossed the frayed cowhide away, and turned and walked homeward. Then one of them picked up Bittridge's hat and set it aslant on his head, and others helped pull his collar together and tie his cravat.|$|R
40|$|Neck collars of {{man-made}} {{marine debris}} were seen on 208 Antarctic fur seals (and removed from 170) during the 142 {{days of the}} 1988 – 1989 pup-rearing season at Bird Island, South Georgia. This represents at least 0. 1 % of the total Bird Island population and a minimum of 0. 4 % of animals in the best covered areas; a maximum value might approach 1 %. Polypropylene straps (packaging bands) formed 59 % of collars, nylon string (16 %), fishing net (13 %) and six other materials comprised the rest. Males accounted for 71 % of entanglements, 88 % of which were of young (1 – 4 yr old) animals; females accounted for 64 % of animals older than this. Obvious physical injury was being caused to 30 % of animals and only on 19 % of animals was the <b>collar</b> <b>loose</b> enough potentially to come off. The {{magnitude of the problem}} at South Georgia is similar to that with northern fur seals at the Pribilof Islands, where a significant population decline has occurred concurrently. Antarctic fur seals are still increasing in numbers but stricter controls on the jettisoning of debris into the Southern Ocean ate needed if the entanglement problem is not to increase beyond the level of a potential threat...|$|R
6000|$|After {{an early}} dinner, Paul {{found his way}} to the little theatre. He had already been struck by a highly colored poster near the Bahnhof, {{purporting}} that a distinguished German company would give a representation of [...] "Uncle Tom's Cabin," [...] and certain peculiarities in the pictorial advertisement of the tableaux gave promise of some entertainment. He found the theatre fairly full; there was the usual contingent of abonnirte officers, a fair sprinkling of English and German travelers, but apparently none of his own countrymen. He had no time to examine the house more closely, for the play, commencing with simple punctuality, not only far exceeded the promise of the posters, but of any previous performance of the play he had witnessed. Transported at once to a gorgeous tropical region--the slave States of America--resplendent with the fruits and palms of Mauritius, and peopled exclusively with Paul and Virginia's companions in striped cotton, Hathaway managed to keep a composed face, until the arrival of the good Southern planter St. Clair as one of the earlier portraits of Goethe, in top boots, light kerseymere breeches, redingote and <b>loose</b> Byron <b>collar,</b> compelled him to shrink into the upper corner of the box with his handkerchief to his face. Luckily, the action passed as the natural effect upon a highly sympathetic nature of religious interviews between a round-faced flaxen-haired [...] "Kleine Eva" [...] and [...] "Onkeel Tome," [...] occasionally assisted by a Dissenting clergyman in Geneva bands; of excessive brutality with a cattle whip by a Zamiel-like Legree; of the sufferings of a runaway negro Zimmermadchen with a child three shades lighter than herself; and of a painted canvas [...] "man-hunt," [...] where apparently four well known German composers on horseback, with flowing hair, top boots, and a Cor de chasse, were pursuing, {{with the aid of a}} pack of fox hounds, [...] "the much too deeply abused and yet spiritually elevated Onkeel Tome." [...] Paul did not wait for the final apotheosis of [...] "der Kleine Eva," [...] but, in the silence of a hushed audience, made his way into the corridor and down the staircase. He was passing an open door marked [...] "Direction," [...] when his attention was sharply attracted by a small gathering around it and the sounds of indignant declamation. It was the voice of a countryman--more than that, it was a familiar voice, that he had not heard for three years--the voice of Colonel Harry Pendleton! ...|$|R
