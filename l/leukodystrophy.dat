25|$|However, how {{sulfatide}} buildup causes demyelination and neural degeneration {{is still}} mostly unknown. Metachromatic <b>Leukodystrophy</b> results in neurological manifestations that are {{centered on the}} impairment of {{the central nervous system}} and the peripheral nervous system, including the following: seizures, progressive coordination and speech problems, and behavioral disturbances. Treatment is still being studied and evaluated, but mice studies indicate that treatments, including gene therapy, cell-based therapies using oligodendrocyte progenitors cells, enzyme replacement therapy, or adeno-associated viral and lentiviral mediated gene therapy may prove to be effective in reducing the effects of Metachromatic <b>Leukodystrophy.</b>|$|E

Even though <b>leukodystrophies</b> essentially affect children in early infancy and childhood, these disorders may affect adults. In adults, <b>leukodystrophies</b> may present a distinct clinical and imaging presentation {{other than those}} found in childhood. Clinical awareness of late-onset <b>leukodystrophies</b> should be increased as new therapies emerge. MRI is a useful tool to evaluate white matter disorders and some characteristics findings can help the diagnosis of <b>leukodystrophies.</b> This review article briefly describes the imaging characteristics {{of the most common}} adult <b>leukodystrophies...</b>|$|R
50|$|With many {{different}} types of <b>leukodystrophies</b> and causes, treatment therapies vary for each type. Many studies and clinical trials are in progress to find treatment and therapies for each of the different <b>leukodystrophies.</b> Stem cell transplants and gene therapy appear to be the most promising in treating all <b>leukodystrophies</b> providing it is done as early as possible. For hypomyelinating <b>leukodystrophies,</b> therapeutic research into cell-based therapies appears promising. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells and neural stem cells have been transplanted successfully and have shown to be healthy a year later. Fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity maps showed possible myelination in the region of the transplant. Induced pluripotent stem cells, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, gene correction, and transplantation to promote the maturation, survival, and myelination of oligodendrocytes seem to be the primary routes for possible treatments.|$|R

25|$|Metachromatic <b>leukodystrophy,</b> {{also known}} as MLD, is a {{recessive}} lysosomal storage disorder. It {{is believed to be}} caused by a deficiency in arylsulfatase A. Arylsulfatase A is a lysosomal sulfatase that is able to hydrolyze the 3-O-sulfogalactosylceramide and 3-O-sulfolactosylceramide. Both 3-O-sulfolactosylceramide and 3-O-sulfogalactosylceramide can be located mainly in the central nervous system {{as well as in the}} peripheral nervous system. When lacking the lysosomal enzyme or mutations in the gene coding for saposin B occur, this can lead to the accumulation of lysosomal sulfatide, which then develops into metachromatic <b>leukodystrophy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{has been}} shown to play a role or have some {{association}} with several diseases and infections.

The objectives {{of this study are}} (1) to define the neuroradiologic pattern in a cohort of POLR 3 A and POLR 3 B subjects and (2) to compare the neuroradiologic pattern of Pol III-related <b>leukodystrophies</b> with other hypomyelinating disorders. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations of 13 patients with POLR 3 A and POLR 3 B mutations and of 14 patients with other hypomyelinating disorders were analyzed. All the subjects with Pol III-related <b>leukodystrophies</b> presented hypomyelination associated with T 2 hypointensity of the thalami and/or the pallida. Twelve subjects (92 %) presented T 2 hypointensity of the optic radiations. Cerebellar atrophy was observed in most patients (92 %).

25|$|In {{the case}} of {{autosomal}} dominant <b>leukodystrophy,</b> the disease {{is associated with a}} duplication of the lamin B gene LMNB1. The exact dosage of lamin B in cells appears to be crucial for nuclear integrity as increased expression of lamin B causes a degenerative phenotype in fruit flies and leads to abnormal nuclear morphology.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the myelin. Myelin acts as an insulating sheath that surrounds many nerve fibers and increases the speed at which impulses are conducted. When sulfatide is not distributed properly, it can affect the normal physiological conduction of electrical impulses between nerve cells. This then results in demyelination because of the buildup of sulfatide and is the main cause of Metachromatic <b>Leukodystrophy.</b>|$|E

Most of these symptoms develop after birth, typically during childhood or adolescence. Some laminopathies however may lead to an early death, and mutations of lamin B (LMNB1 gene) may be lethal before or at birth.|$|E
50|$|Megalencephalic {{leukoencephalopathy}} with subcortical cysts (MLC, or Van der Knaap disease) {{is a form}} of hereditary CNS demyelinating disease. It {{belongs to}} a group of disorders called <b>leukodystrophies.</b>|$|R

25|$|An {{abnormal}} metabolism {{or change}} in the expression of sulfatide has also been associated with various pathologies, including neuropathologies, such as metachromatic <b>leukodystrophy,</b> Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Sulfatide is also associated with diabetes mellitus, cancer metastasis, and viruses, including HIV-1, influenza A virus, hepatitis C and vaccinia virus. Additionally, overexpression of sulfatide {{has been linked to}} epilepsy and audiogenic seizures as well as other pathological states in the nervous system.|$|E

25|$|In July {{researchers}} reported promising results for six children with two severe hereditary diseases {{had been treated}} with a partially deactivated lentivirus to replace a faulty gene and after 7–32 months. Three of the children had metachromatic <b>leukodystrophy,</b> which causes children to lose cognitive and motor skills.

Follow up trials with gene therapy on another six children with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome were also reported as promising.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{degradation}} {{occurs in}} the lysosomes. Here, arylsulfatase A hydrolyzes the sulfate group. However, in order for this reaction to be carried out, a sphingolipid activator protein such as saposin B must be present. Saposin B extracts sulfatide from the membrane, which makes it accessible to arylsulfatase A. Arylsulfatase A can then hydrolyze the sulfate group. Accumulation of sulfatide can cause metachromatic <b>leukodystrophy,</b> a lysosomal storage disease and may be caused because of a defect in arylsulfatase A, leading to an inability to degrade sulfatide.|$|E
25|$|Abnormal {{expression}} of sulfatide {{is linked to}} several neurological disorders. As stated before, {{one of the major}} neurological disorders is Metachromatic <b>Leukodystrophy,</b> which is caused by elevated levels of sulfatide, leading to the progressive loss of myelin as a result of sulfatide accumulation. High levels of sulfatide in the gray matter in the cerebellum and in the superior frontal lobe have been associated with Parkinson's disease. Additionally, accumulation of sulfatide in neurons causes audiogenic seizures, which {{have been shown to be}} lethal in mouse models. On the other hand, reduced levels of sulfatide in the cerebral gray and white matter have been associated with Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
50|$|Leukoencephalopathy with {{vanishing}} {{white matter}} (VWM disease) is an autosomal recessive neurological disease.

500|$|An {{inherited}} genetic {{problem that}} exists in the breed is globoid cell <b>leukodystrophy.</b> It is not breed-specific, and can appear in Cairn Terriers and other breeds including Beagles and Pomeranians. It is a neurological disease where the dog lacks an enzyme called galactosylceramidase. The symptoms are noticeable as the puppy develops, and can be identified by the age of 30 weeks. Affected dogs have tremors, muscle weakness, and trouble walking. Symptoms slowly increase until limb paralysis begins to occur. Due to it being a hereditary condition, owners should avoid breeding affected animals to eliminate it from the breed. Another genetic condition that affects the breed is [...] "white dog shaker syndrome". As this condition is most commonly found in Westies and Maltese, the condition was originally thought to be connected to the genes for white coats, but the same condition has since been found in other nonwhite breeds including the Yorkshire Terrier and the Dachshund. The condition typically develops over one to three days, resulting in tremors of the head and limbs, ataxia, and hypermetria. Affected males and females can be affected for different lengths of time, with symptoms in females lasting between four and six weeks, while males can be affected the rest of their lives.|$|E
