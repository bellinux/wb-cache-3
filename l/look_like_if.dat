5|$|During the 1993 {{run for the}} {{national}} title, Smith used a method that was introduced to him {{at a conference in}} Switzerland. At the conference, Smith was presented a tape by a lecturer who used doctored images to achieve his goal of losing weight. The photos showed the lecturer what he would <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>if</b> he were thinner as motivation to reach his weight-loss goals. Smith took a picture of the scoreboard from the 1982 Championship, modified it to read 1993 and erased the name Georgetown, leaving that space blank. He proceeded to place copies of the doctored photo in all of the players' lockers.|$|E

25|$|For a {{settlement}} of such size, New Belgrade has some unusual cultural characteristics, influenced by the Yugoslav communists' ideas how a new and modern city should <b>look</b> <b>like.</b> <b>If</b> it can be understood why there were no churches built, a fact that a city of 250,000 has no theaters and only one museum (out of the residential area) is much less comprehensible, underlying the decades long Belgrader's feel of New Belgrade being nothing more but a big dormitory.|$|E
25|$|The goal {{of these}} {{missions}} {{is not only}} to detect Earth-sized planets, but also to directly detect light from the planet so that it may be studied spectroscopically. By examining planetary spectra, {{it would be possible to}} determine the basic composition of an extrasolar planet's atmosphere and/or surface. Given this knowledge, it may be possible to assess the likelihood of life being found on that planet. A NASA research group, the Virtual Planet Laboratory, is using computer modeling to generate a wide variety of virtual planets to see what they would <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>if</b> viewed by TPF or Darwin. It is hoped that once these missions come online, their spectra can be cross-checked with these virtual planetary spectra for features that might indicate the presence of life.|$|E

500|$|The Excelsior was a {{new design}} that ILM felt was a better {{rendition}} of a Federation starship—sleeker and more modern than the Enterprise.

The original working title of the film was Around. While exploring film title designs for the picture, Carradine came across a style called Americana. [...] "I {{was trying to figure}} out what it would <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>if</b> it said Around. Suddenly, I said to myself, 'Why am I doing this, anyway? It's right here in front of me.'

Pandering to the 'Cool, let's see that again' crowd has made Lionsgate rich but done nothing for this unendurable endurance contest of this long-enduring film franchise".

500|$|The Hobbs Company {{continued}} to interpose objections in 1913. On February 3, Hobbs sent Roberts a lengthy list {{of changes that}} he wanted in the coin, and the sculptor was required to attend a conference with Hobbs representatives. On the fifth, following the conference, which ended with no agreement, Fraser sent MacVeagh a ten-page letter, complaining that his time was being wasted by the Hobbs Company, and appealing to the Secretary to bring the situation to a close. Secretary MacVeagh agreed {{to hold a meeting}} at his office in Washington on February 14. Barber prepared patterns showing what the nickel would <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>if</b> the changes demanded by Hobbs were made. MacVeagh conducted the meeting much like a legal hearing, and issued a letter the following day. The secretary noted that no other firm had complained, that the Hobbs mechanism had not been widely sold, and that the changes demanded—a clear space around the rim and the flattening of the Indian's cheekbone—would affect the artistic merit of the piece. MacVeagh concluded, [...] "You will please, therefore, proceed with the coinage of the new nickel." ...|$|E
500|$|The Escapist shared similar sentiments, {{calling the}} film [...] "amazing" [...] and stating {{their desire to}} see the mock-trailer {{expanded}} into a full film despite it being contrary to Nintendo's vision of the series; [...] "Why can't anything this cool ever come through official channels?" [...] Joystiq commented that it was [...] "long, long overdue" [...] and called the completed results delightful, questioning why such a project had not been properly attempted years prior. Kotaku added that while the [...] "leaked" [...] segment hid the flaws in the film's effects, it hurt the film by hiding the [...] "hammy charm" [...] of the completed project. Though Game Informer criticized the original segment, they heavily praised the full film, describing it as [...] "what the franchise could <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>if</b> Peter Jackson, Martin Scorsese, and Jerry Bruckheimer all teamed up". Topless Robot stated that while the original preview had nearly sabotaged the final production's appeal, they called it [...] "awesome" [...] and described it as taking [...] "Pokémon battles to its inevitable, cock-fighting end". Cinemablend stated that while the content was out of place with Nintendo's presentation of the series, they found the finished product still [...] "pretty cool", further praising the effects and the approach taken towards the material.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{apparent}} agreement, the Hobbs Company continued to interpose objections.

[...] Hobbs Company agent C. U. Carpenter suggested that Reith had been intimidated by the preparations that had already gone into the issue of the modified nickel, [...] "and, instead of pointing out clearly just what the situation demanded, agreed to adapt our device to the coin more readily that [...] he was warranted in doing". [...] On February 3, Hobbs sent Roberts a lengthy list of changes that he wanted in the coin, and the sculptor was required to attend a conference with Hobbs and Reith. [...] On the fifth, following the conference, which ended with no agreement, Fraser sent MacVeagh a ten-page letter, complaining that his time was being wasted by the Hobbs Company, and appealing to the Secretary to bring the situation to a close. [...] MacVeagh agreed to hold a meeting at his office in Washington on February 14. When the Hobbs Company requested permission to bring a lawyer, Fraser announced he would be doing the same. The Hobbs Company sought letters of support from the business community, with little success; Fraser's efforts to secure support from artists for his position were more fruitful.

500|$|Thrive was {{recorded}} at Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee, with producer Mark A. Miller. According to lead vocalist Mark Hall, {{the idea behind}} Thrive came from the student ministry he is involved in. As a youth pastor, Hall frequently uses Psalms 1, which metaphorically compares {{the concept of a}} righteous man to a prosperous tree planted by a river. Hall said that many people he has talked with are simply surviving, which he feels contrasts with this — he felt that, although hard times can come upon anyone, people are not put in these situations to simply survive through them, but rather to thrive through the adversity. Using the metaphor, Hall noted that, if one were to pull away all the dirt from around a tree, one would find roots digging into the ground in addition to the limbs of the tree reaching out. Hall elaborated that [...] "you need to get your strength from God; you don’t get it on your own. If you’re all limbs, the thorns of life will knock you over. You need to dig your roots in and let God reach out through you". Accordingly, half of the record focuses on 'reaching out', while the other half focuses on 'digging deep'. Hall described the record as being [...] "an effort to draw a picture of what a believer, a follower of Jesus, would <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>if</b> they dug into their roots and understood God and themselves more, and then instead of trying to go be Christian for God, they just let God give them chances to be a Christian".|$|E

2500|$|Stinkoman 20X6 (abbreviated to 20X6; {{pronounced}} [...] "twenty exty-six"), {{a parody}} of the Mega Man and EarthBound games' [...] "year 200X", originated from Strong Bad Email #57, japanese cartoon, an email asking Strong Bad what he would <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>if</b> he were in a Japanese anime.

The game of the same name was heavily based on the Mega Man series, particularly the first 6 levels. Stinkoman's name comes from a conversation Homestar Runner and Strong Bad had while marooned on a desert island.
