5|$|Lead {{affects the}} {{peripheral}} nervous system (especially motor nerves) and the central nervous system. Peripheral nervous system effects are more prominent in adults and central nervous system effects are more prominent in children. Lead causes the axons of nerve cells to degenerate and <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> myelin coats.|$|E
5|$|Space is also crisscrossed with {{continuum}} fluxes, coordinate pairs {{that allow}} instantaneous travel between them without consuming fuel.

5|$|Anti-Communist {{sentiment}} {{gripped the}} United States during the Cold War beginning in 1946. Federal investigations caused many persons with Communist or left-leaning affiliations to <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> jobs, become blacklisted, or be jailed. During the Cold War, although the United States collectively ignored {{the civil rights}} of Communists, other civil liberties—such as due process in law and separation of church and state—continued to be reinforced and even expanded.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens {{are known}} to steal and cache shiny objects such as pebbles, pieces of metal, and golf balls. One theory is that they hoard shiny objects to impress other ravens. Other {{research}} indicates that juveniles are deeply curious about all new things, and that common ravens retain an attraction to bright, round objects based on their similarity to bird eggs. Mature birds <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> intense interest in the unusual, and become highly neophobic.|$|E

30|$|The {{extent to}} what workers fear <b>losing</b> <b>their</b> jobs can be {{affected}} not just by the likelihood of <b>losing</b> <b>their</b> job, {{but also by the}} costs associated with the loss for a worker. For example, these costs may be lower if a worker has alternative income sources (a second job or a pension).|$|R
5|$|I., II., and III./KG 55 {{were also}} in action. III./KG 55 bombed Heathrow Airport. Results are unknown and losses are unclear. KG 55 {{suffered}} heavy losses the previous day, so its operations seemed limited. On 12 August it lost 13 Heinkel He 111s and their crews. The next day, 14 August, they would <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) Alois Stoeckl.|$|E
5|$|Litter {{accumulation}} is {{a perennial}} {{problem in the}} subway system. In the 1970s and 1980s, dirty trains and platforms, as well as graffiti were a serious problem. The situation had improved since then, but the 2010 budget crisis, which caused over 100 of the cleaning staff to <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> jobs, threatened to curtail trash removal from the subway system. Every day, the MTA removes 40 tons of trash from 3,500 trash receptacles.|$|E
5|$|Local governments {{follow a}} {{modified}} version of the separation of powers used in the national government. An assembly may pass a vote of no confidence in the executive, in which case the executive must either dissolve the assembly within ten days or automatically <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> office. Following the next election, however, the executive remains in office unless the new assembly again passes a no confidence resolution.|$|E

5|$|Roughly {{three years}} after the {{foundation}} stone laying ceremony, the airport was inaugurated on 14 March 2008 amid protests. The Telugu Desam Party repeated its demand for the naming of the domestic terminal. In addition, on 12 and 13 March, 20,000 AAI employees had conducted a strike against the closure of Begumpet Airport, {{as well as that of}} HAL Airport in Bangalore, fearing they would <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> jobs.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} the siege marked the {{beginning}} of Muhammad's undoubted political ascendancy in the city of Medina. The Meccans had exerted their utmost strength to dislodge Muhammad from Medina, and this defeat caused them to <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> trade with Syria and much of their prestige with it. Watt conjectures that the Meccans at this point began to contemplate that conversion to Islam would be the most prudent option.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of food riots had ended by 1801, {{and there were}} certain political undertones to the actions, though lack of leadership meant that little came of it. By the 1870s, 60% of Wales was owned by 570 families, most of whom did no farming. Instead, they employed workers, who were forced to vote Tory or <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> jobs.|$|E
5|$|At the 2013 European Championship in Sweden, the Germans {{won their}} sixth {{straight}} continental title, with the decisive game being a 1–0 victory over Norway. Goalkeeper Nadine Angerer, who stopped two penalties during the final, {{was chosen as}} the tournament's best player. The 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup had Germany again reaching the top four. In the semifinal against the United States, Célia Šašić, who wound up as the tournament's top scorer, missed a penalty, and afterwards goals by Carli Lloyd and Kelley O'Hara lead to an American victory. The third place match saw the Germans <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> first ever match to England after 21 contests, due to a penalty kick by Fara Williams during extra time.|$|E
5|$|Both UCLA and Texas would <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> {{respective}} games; also, Nebraska, {{which had}} entered the Big Ten Championship Game at No. 12 in the BCS, was blown out 70–31 by a Wisconsin team that entered the game at 7–5. All of this {{opened the door for}} the winner of the MAC game to enter the top 16. Northern Illinois won and vaulted to #15 in the BCS Standings, earning a spot in the 2013 Orange Bowl. The berth was the first ever for a MAC team in a BCS game, and was also the first BCS berth ever for a one-loss non-AQ team.|$|E
