30|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient SAR image classification method through learning from <b>label</b> proportions. Grid <b>labeling</b> is introduced {{to obtain the}} truth of training data more efficiently. In order to eliminate <b>label</b> uncertainty coming from grid <b>labeling,</b> we present an SVM-based model for learning from <b>label</b> proportions. A proximate inference algorithm is proposed through defining a reweighting strategy which has considered <b>label</b> agreement and <b>label</b> proportions. Our method not only outperforms ∝SVM, a state-of-the-art approach on learning from <b>label</b> proportions, but also demonstrates comparable accuracy with traditional classification methods working with pixel <b>labeling,</b> while bringing great reduction of <b>labeling</b> cost for training data. Future work includes developing an automatic estimation method for <b>label</b> proportions to further reduce human labor in sample <b>labeling</b> and extending our method to more application scenarios, such as SAR urban LULC mapping [3, 14] and multispectral image classification.|$|R

5|$|The kulintang {{repertoire}} has no fixed <b>labels</b> {{because the}} music {{itself is not}} considered a fixed entity. Due to the fact it is orally transmitted, the repertoire itself is considered something always {{in a state of}} flux due to two primary reasons. First, standardized titles weren’t considered a priority. Though to the musicians themselves the melodies would sound similar, the <b>labels</b> they would place on a particular rhythmic mode or style could vary even from household to household within that same village. For the musicians, the emphasis is on the excitement and pleasure of playing the music without much regard to what the piece was referred to as. Secondly, because musicians improvised their pieces regularly, modes and styles were continually revised and changed as they were passed on to a newer generation of musicians, making the pieces and therefore the <b>labels</b> attached to them relevant only during a certain frame of time.|$|E
