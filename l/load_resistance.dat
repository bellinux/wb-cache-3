ICRF heating {{has been used in}} the Large Helical Device (LHD) and contributes to high-power steady-state experiments.

Many elements influence the antenna <b>loading</b> <b>resistance.</b> Here, the dependence of the <b>loading</b> <b>resistance</b> on various parameters is investigated. The <b>loading</b> <b>resistance</b> is very low at lower wave frequencies. High-power injection using such frequencies was difficult in plasma heating experiments in the LHD. The <b>loading</b> <b>resistance</b> increases with the plasma density. The distance between the antenna and the plasma boundary is closely related to the plasma edge density. It is important to keep the antenna away from the plasma and also keep the <b>loading</b> <b>resistance</b> at a certain level in steady-state operation for the various types of plasma. The effect of additional heating and magnetic field strength are also investigated. These results will contribute to the design of new ICRF antennas, the ICRF heating experiment in the LHD, and ICRF heating in future plasma devices...|$|R

The aim of the investigation was to measure and compare the dynamic <b>loading</b> <b>resistance</b> of endodontically treated teeth with cast metal and prefabricated posts and cores, under dynamic loading fatigue of 800 N- 1000 N, with specific regard to variable root preparation width. The investigation included 48 human lower second premolars of similar dimensions, divided in 4 groups according to type of post and core system (each 6 mm long) which they received. 1) prefabricated narrow post and core (Maillefer Switzerland, Size 1) 2) prefabricated wide post and core (Maillefer Switzerland, Size 3 B) 3) cast metal narrow post and core 4) cast metal wide post and core. Modified Voss & Meiners dynamic loading tests were performed within a field of 800 N- 1000 N in high frequency pulsator. Teeth with prefabricated narrow posts demonstrated the highest average dynamic <b>loading</b> <b>resistance</b> of 9. 050. 622 cycles under 800 N until fracture, while teeth with cast metal wide posts demonstrated the lowest average dynamic <b>loading</b> <b>resistance</b> of 3. 522. 611 cycles under 1000 N until fracture.

The MRC-WPT system with {{a single pair of}} transmitter and receiver has been extensively studied in the literature, while there is limited work on the general setup with multiple transmitters and/or receivers. In this paper, we consider a point-to-multipoint MRC-WPT system with one transmitter sending power wirelessly to a set of distributed receivers simultaneously. We derive the power delivered to the load of each receiver in closed-form expression, and reveal a "near-far" fairness issue in multiuser power transmission due to users' distance-dependent mutual inductances with the transmitter. We also show that by designing the receivers' <b>load</b> <b>resistances,</b> the near-far issue can be optimally solved. Specifically, we propose a centralized algorithm to jointly optimize the <b>load</b> <b>resistances</b> to minimize the power drawn from the energy source at the transmitter under given power requirements for the loads.

This effect is studied via NEMEC simulations. Rigid rotation of the MP field is found to produce a coherent antenna <b>loading</b> <b>resistance</b> modulation, suggesting an interplay between the non-axisymmetric magnetic field structure and the wave coupling properties.

This thesis describes the calibration process used to select the <b>load</b> and <b>resistance</b> factors for the fatigue limit states of steel bridge members within the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. The process presented within this thesis builds upon work completed as part of the Strategic Highway Research Program No. 2 including the determination of the fatigue <b>load</b> model. The <b>resistance</b> model was developed using available fatigue test data and statistically analyzed using specially developed techniques. Target reliability indices of 1. 0 were chosen for all steel detail types based upon a procedure using Monte Carlo simulations and engineering judgment. <b>Load</b> and <b>resistance</b> factors were finally chosen for both Fatigue I and Fatigue II service limit states.
