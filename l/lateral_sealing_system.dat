40|$|Many {{researchers}} {{worked a}} lot on geologic conditions for <b>lateral</b> <b>sealing</b> of faults, but none of their studies took the effect of internal structures of fault zones on the <b>lateral</b> <b>sealing</b> capacity of faults. Therefore, the <b>lateral</b> <b>sealing</b> of active faults has rarely been discussed. In this paper, based on {{the analysis of the}} composition and structure characteristics of fault fillings, the geological conditions for <b>lateral</b> <b>sealing</b> of active faults and relevant research method were discussed in reference to the <b>lateral</b> <b>sealing</b> mechanisms of inactive fault rocks. It is shown that, in order to satisfy geologically the <b>lateral</b> <b>sealing</b> of active faults, the faults should be antithetic and the faulted strata should be mainly composed of mudstone, so that the displacement pressure of fault fillings is higher than or equal to that of reservoir rocks in oil and gas migration block. Then, a research method for the <b>lateral</b> <b>sealing</b> of active faults was established by comparing the displacement pressure of fillings in the fault with that of reservoir rocks in oil and gas migration block. This method was applied to three antithetic faults (F 1, F 2 and F 3) in No. 1 structure of the Nanpu Sag, Bohai Bay Basin. As revealed, the fillings of these three active faults were mostly argillaceous at the stage of natural gas accumulation (the late stage of Neogene Minghuazhen Fm sedimentation), and their displacement pressures were higher than that of reservoir rocks in the first member of Paleogene Dongying Fm (F 1 and F 3) and the Neogene Guantao Fm (F 2). Accordingly, they are laterally sealed for natural gas, which is conducive to the accumulation and preservation of natural gas. Industrial gas flow has been produced from the first member of Paleogene Dongying Fm in Well Np 101, the Guantao Fm in Well Np 1 - 2 and the first member of Paleogene Dongying Fm in Well Np 1, which is in agreement with the analysis result. It is verified that this method is feasible for investigating the <b>lateral</b> <b>sealing</b> of active faults...|$|R

40|$|LectureFor years, {{labyrinth}} shaft-end seals {{have been}} used for centrifugal compressors handling air and nonhazardous gases, and for low suction pressure compressors in hydrocarbon service. To prevent gas leakage from the hydrocarbon machines, either injection of inert gas or jet ejector systems have been applied with the seals. The ejectors were normally arranged to exhaust back to the compressor suction. Early application of labyrinth/ejector <b>seal</b> <b>systems</b> were generally on compressors with suction pressures in the 0 - 8 psig range, and the <b>seal</b> <b>system</b> operation was generally satisfactory. Many of the older machines have been uprated to higher suction pressures. The labyrinth/ejector <b>seal</b> <b>systems</b> have been applied to newer compressors with suction pressures as high as 15 psig. Many of the systems do not perform satisfactorily, and operators complain of leakage of hydrocarbons and contamination of the lube oil. This {{may be the result of}} noncritical-flow ejectors operating with critical pressure ratios. Labyrinth/ejector <b>seal</b> <b>systems</b> can be designed to perform satisfactorily with the higher compressor suction pressures, but these systems often require critical-flow ejectors. Despite their relatively low initial cost, the economics of labyrinth/ejector <b>seal</b> <b>systems</b> for high compressor suction pressures may not compare favorably with oil-type <b>seal</b> <b>systems</b> because of the energy required to recycle motive gas...|$|R
