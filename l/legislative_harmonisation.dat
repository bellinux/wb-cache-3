It then undertakes a critical assessment {{of the development of}} the building blocks of the CEAS other than <b>legislative</b> <b>harmonisation,</b> namely: practical cooperation, solidarity and fair-sharing of responsibility as well as the system’s external dimension. It comments on how the promise of the creation of a CEAS could be further pursued, including on how to address current shortcomings. The perspectives are based both on legislative and policy initiatives that have been announced by the EU institutions, but also on the authors’ personal assessment...|$|E

The response of the Member States, {{in the form of the}} Single European Act, was to extend by ten the number of articles in the treaties which required majority voting. This extension was linked for the most part to policy objectives (such as the <b>legislative</b> <b>harmonisations</b> necessary for completing the internal market by 1992), and the follow-up of unanimously-agreed framework decisions (e.g. individual research programmes, following the unanimous adoption of the multi-annual framework for research; and Regional Fund decisions, following the unanimous adoption of the overall regulation for the structural funds).|$|R

40|$|Summary: The {{process of}} European {{enlargement}} had a peculiar nature. Prior to accession in 2004, EU law {{was not yet}} formally binding on EU candidates’ domestic courts, while the obligation of gradual harmonisation with EU law rested upon them. Consequently, the application of EU law in future Member States presented particularly interesting problems and challenges, and required {{an understanding of the}} sophisticated concept of EU law’s persuasive force. The only rational choice was to apply Community law, taking into account not only the limited scope of the <b>legislative</b> texts for <b>harmonisation,</b> but also Community law in its full meaning. This included the texts of European directives, which had to be transposed into domestic law, as well as their reasoning and rationale, which would explain why a particular policy was regulated at the European level; ECJ jurisprudence; and, ideally, also the case law of EU Member States. This article argues that this involves a special type of use of comparative law...|$|R

As its stands there is, to varying degrees, disparity between each of the relevant Australian Acts. This disparity is particularly marked between the Western Australian and Northern Territory Acts, on the one hand, and the New South Wales, Victorian, Queensland, Australian Capital Territory, Tasmanian and South Australian Acts on the other.

The existence and progress of society is assured if the interaction of the two terms - population and economy – met certain quality and dimensional characteristics, one of them referring to the degree of use of the labour fore. The reorganization of the Romanian socio-economical system, in conformity with the market economy demands generated inmost changes in the labor market including the unemployment occurrence as a mass phenomenon. The unemployment, negative phenomenon of the socio-economical space and main factor of economical instability and social conflicts as a consequence, is neither uncontrollable nor has a unique way of development if adequate correlated measures are promoted by acting competently. One of the essential objectives of the socio-economical policies in Romania is a place of work guaranteed and a decent level of living. <b>Legislative</b> <b>harmonisation,</b> the labour market, social policies, the unemployment...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of European banking markets has substantially {{changed over the}} past decade, partially {{as a result of}} the creation of the Single Internal Market. The process of integration and accompanying deregulation has embodied an incentive for bank management to focus on improving efficiency, especially given the more competitive banking environment. In this paper, employing the non-parametric DEA approach, we investigate whether the productive efficiency of European banking systems has improved and converged towards a common European frontier between 1993 and 1997, following the process of EU <b>legislative</b> <b>harmonisation.</b> We also examine the determinants of European bank efficiency using a Tobit regression model approach. We then extend the established literature on the determinants bank efficiency by taking into account the problem of the inherent dependency of DEA efficiency scores when used in regression analysis. To overcome the dependency problem a bootstrapping technique is applied. Overall, the results suggest that since the EU’s Single Market Programme there has been a small improvement in bank efficiency levels, although there is little evidence to suggest that these have converged. Efficiency differences across European banking markets appear to be mainly determined by country-specific factors...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{critically}} examines a new European {{approach to}} business failure and insolvency. It addresses the broader political {{dimensions of the}} subject and sets the new European approach {{in the context of}} the objectives of insolvency law to rescue viable businesses and to liquidate non-viable ones. The comparable US procedure – Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code – is used as a reference point for detailed analysis. The paper suggests that the new approach is of particular importance and adds value in those EU Member States that have underdeveloped restructuring frameworks. It is also suggested however, that any measures of <b>legislative</b> <b>harmonisation</b> should be of the minimum harmonisation variety leaving scope for regulatory differentiation and allowing national governments to build on local restructuring frameworks and domestic business practices that work well. This paper critically examines a new European approach to business failure and insolvency.

The paper addresses the broader political dimensions of the subject and also uses the comparable US procedure – Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code – as a reference point for detailed analysis. Given the ‘Brexit’ vote in the UK, this new European approach is not of immediate direct relevance in the UK.

40|$|The {{most recent}} {{enlargement}} of the European Union, which incorporated post-communist countries from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), placed relatively little emphasis on the equal opportunities of men and women. However, acceding countries were required to implement Chapter 13 (‘Employment and social affairs’) of the acquis communautaire, which includes legislative provisions promoting gender equality in the workplace. This paper considers {{the extent to which}} the equality acquis has been transposed, implemented, and enforced in ten CEE countries. It begins by examining the pre- 89 equality infrastructure, which provides a comparative basis for the paper’s substantive analysis of the implementation of the ten equality directives. In particular, it discusses the legal mechanisms used to implement the legislation, evaluates whether pre- 89 provisions have been strengthened or weakened, and highlights remaining problems in harmonisation. Next, the paper evaluates awareness of the equality directives among women, employers and judges. It analyses the enforcement of these directives by labour inspectorates and ombudspersons, while also noting the limited case law. It then examines relations between CEE governments and both NGOs and trade unions, considering whether these bodies are promoting awareness and enforcement of the equality legislation. In conclusion, the paper argues that <b>legislative</b> <b>harmonisation</b> has legitimised women’s claim to genuine equality but has made only a marginal change in practice as women remain numerically weaker than men and hold less favourable positions in most areas.

40|$|The {{role of the}} Court of Justice of the European Union in {{the process}} of direct tax {{integration}} in the European Union (EU) has been widely discussed in the academic literature, while another important actor, the European Commission, has attracted much less attention. The Commission’s input is commonly perceived to be limited to the right of legislative initiative. This study questions such an oversimplified interpretation and draws a more nuanced picture of EU tax harmonisation by integrating an analysis of the complex regulatory approaches adopted by the Commission for the establishment and smooth functioning of the Internal Market. It is argued that the past decade brought a notable change in the Court-dominated pattern of direct tax integration. This change is apparent first in the evolution of enforcement strategies under Articles 258 and 260 TFEU; and second, in the increased reliance upon non-binding regulatory measures. Both developments have strengthened the role of the Commission, supplying it with more possibilities for influencing national direct tax systems, despite the reluctance of Member States to agree upon <b>legislative</b> <b>harmonisation.</b> Against this background, the procedural and substantive problems associated with these instruments require closer examination. The normative scope of this research covers the key procedural problems related to the infringement procedure and non-binding regulatory measures. The empirical component explores the Commission’s enforcement and coordination practices, drawing particular attention to two case studies: the tax treatment of losses in cross-border situations and exit taxation. Following the analysis of enforcement and coordination in the field of direct taxation, the study argues the need and proposes potential solutions for (i) the developing of a more comprehensive procedural framework for the infringement procedure and non-binding regulatory acts; (ii) the strengthening of accountability mechanisms; and (iii) the enhancing of the effectiveness of their application.

40|$|The {{world is}} {{experiencing}} {{an increasing number}} of free-trade areas between developed and developing countries (think of NAFTA, the Free Trade Area of the Americas, APEC, the Euromediterranean Partnership, or the free trade agreements between the EU and Turkey, Mexico, South Africa or Mercosur and between the United States and Jordan, most of them still in the transitory period before full implementation). However, most of these schemes are being implemented out of a blind confidence in the positive effects of trade liberalisation regardless of the framework conditions, without much true empirical evidence on their impact on developing countries, let alone a serious reconsideration of the standard trade integration (custom unions) theory to adapt it to the special circumstances of developing countries. Due to the high social transformation potential of international trade, this could ultimately prove a dangerous economic engineering experiment for the development prospects of less developed countries, particularly the smaller ones. After a brief summary of the conventional trade integration theory, the paper refers to five aspects of free-trade areas between developed and developing countries which are not tackled by the this theory and which could question its assumptions predictions: the (high) import and (low) export elasticities which might prove wrong the positive impact on the current account balance of trade liberalisation; the possible working of economies of agglomeration favouring concentration of economic activities in more developed areas of a free-trade area; the eventual preference for industry in low-competitiveness countries which without a certain level of protection might lose any chance of industrialisation; the impact of those free-trade areas on inward foreign direct investment into developing countries, which might be actually negative; and the macroeconomic and political sustainability (far from granted) of those free trade areas. The conclusion {{is that there is a}} need to adapt conventional trade integration theory to the particular case of free-trade areas between developed and developing countries, and this cannot be done from a purely trade theory perspective, but must also take into account development theory and political economy considerations. In any case, a preliminary analysis seems to indicate that this new framework could favour "deep" integration schemes (where trade liberalisation is supplemented by certain <b>legislative</b> <b>harmonisation,</b> monetary stabilisation schemes and even a sizeable resource transfer from developed to developing countries to support the transition process and compensate the losers) instead of the more frequent "hollow" integration processes (consisting of mere trade barriers removal).

40|$|The global {{fisheries}} {{crisis has}} been of great concern to the international community, and {{has led to the}} adoption of a series of instruments under the fisheries framework of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC). These post-LOSC fisheries instruments include the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas (Compliance Agreement); the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (Fish Stocks Agreement); the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (Code of Conduct); and the International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing (IPOAIUU). The aforementioned instruments have improved the LOSC fisheries framework and had considerable impact on the way fisheries resources are utilised and managed. However, they have not stopped the continual depletion of fisheries resources as they rely largely on the implementation by individual states to achieve their management objectives. The ineffectiveness of these instruments is mainly {{due to the fact that}} they have not been widely implemented by, or incorporated into, the fisheries law and policy of states. As one of the major fishing nations with the largest population in the world, China has faced many problems managing its fisheries: the severest of which are the depletion of fisheries resources and the deterioration of the marine environment. This situation has necessitated China’s alignment with international fisheries law and policy. The study analyses China’s <b>legislative</b> <b>harmonisation</b> and policy adjustment in response to these international fisheries instruments, in particular resource management, distant water fisheries, and regional fisheries cooperation for the shared fisheries resources in the form of bilateral fisheries agreements with Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam. The study pinpoints the fact that China’s fisheries development, particularly the problems it has encountered, including its excessive fishing capacity, economic incentives, population pressures, and a weak institutional framework, reflect the global situation and provides a basis for understanding the driving forces behind a gradual loss of control of fishing capacity leading to the depletion of resources. China’s national action and regional cooperation mirrors the overall effort of the international community in searching for possible solutions to address the fisheries crisis. The study emphasises that the LOSC will remain as a dynamic instrument and a point of reference for the legal norms at the global, regional and national levels to deal with the countless issues of fisheries management. The post-LOSC instruments will stand as guidelines for states to conserve and manage fisheries resources on the way to achieving sustainable fisheries. States like China will have to fully commit themselves to their obligations and responsibilities to achieve sustainable fisheries management...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{establish}} the Facility Management knowledge categories within the life cycle of a building context. The significance of the study stemmed from research undertaken into the compliance to Australian Standards 1851 - 17 : 2005 Maintenance of Fire and Smoke Doors within West Australian nursing homes, which demonstrated 87 per cent non-compliance. The level of non-compliance appeared to identify a lack of knowledge, and appropriately qualified and experienced personnel involved within the management of nursing homes (Doleman, 2008). The issues identified prompted the question on how facility management knowledge categories evolves and develops throughout the life cycle of a building. The research used a three Phase, Grounded Theory interpretive analysis of the Facility Management knowledge construct. Phase One involved the examination of 21 international tertiary undergraduate Facility Managers courses. The course content was analysed and assessed through linguistic analysis to extract the knowledge categories and subordinate concepts. The findings identified 14 primary knowledge categories which were presented to 10 Facility Management experts for validation. Phase Two presented the findings of Phase One in a Multi Dimensional Scaling (MDS) survey instrument to Facility Management experts for dissimilarity assessments. The results from the 56 completed surveys were embedded within MDS software to present spatial knowledge proximity cluster analysis. The final phase was the validation of the research findings through semi-structured interviews of 10 industry experts, selected with consideration of heterogeneity in order to validate the findings of the previous phase. The outcome of this study was to develop an understanding of the Facility Management knowledge categories within the life cycle of a building context and the identification of 14 core knowledge base, required as a Facility Manager practitioner. Core knowledge categories included Finance as a central theme within the Facility Management domain with Building Services and Business providing an indication as to the broad nature of Facility Management knowledge construct. Also identified within the research was the lack of <b>legislative</b> <b>harmonisation</b> between different states and territories within the Facility Management domain and the disparity between Facility Management practitioners with regards to knowledge context and application. The role of Facility Management and their involvement within the lifecycle of a building was also identified within the research as being little or none during the design and construction phases of the building. The handover and management of the buildings to Facility Managers occurs within the occupancy phase of the buildings life cycle meaning that the building was inherited without due consideration of continued operational efficiencies or functionality affecting the overall cost effectiveness of the building. Such outcomes lead to a number of recommendations such as a the introduction of central knowledge standard in order to provide context of definitions and well as the continued development and drive of Facility Management practitioners and associations to establish the Facility Management profession as a respected body...|$|E
