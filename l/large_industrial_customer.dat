40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} tie lines tripping to enhance power system stability for a <b>large</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>customer</b> with cogeneration units. The mathematical models with the corresponding parameters of generation units, excitation systems, governor systems and loads have been identified and verified. To enhance the system stability, the protective scheme by including the directional over current relay, under voltage relay and under frequency relay with proper settings has been applied. Three various external fault cases have been selected to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed schemes. It is concluded that the system stability of the industrial customer can be improved by {{the proper design of}} protective scheme...|$|E
40|$|The {{electric}} utility industry is undergoing {{fundamental changes in}} the way that new generation capacity may be provided and in the way that electric power is sold to large industrial customers. These changes are increasingly being driven by market forces as American industry responds to the challenge from worthy global competitors for markets in this country and all over the world. The cost of energy for energy intensive industrial companies is absolutely critical to their ability to successfully compete. Conservation efforts have had a dramatic effect on these costs since the early seventies. In this decade, we are witnessing the identification and implementation of innovative, less costly ways of meeting the electric power needs of large customers while, at the same time, providing benefits to utilities and to the utilities? other ratepayers. Innovative ratemaking can be accomplished in a way that promotes more efficient use of generation and transmission facilities. Innovative ratemaking is no longer an option to the considered, but a competitive necessity for every utility and every <b>large</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>customer...</b>|$|E

2500|$|This {{argument}} is disputed by <b>large</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>customers,</b> who {{point out that}} data from 2000 to 2006 indicate that electricity exports prices get lower when quantities increase, and vice versa. [...] "We find that the more we export, the less lucrative it gets", said Luc Boulanger, {{the head of the}} association representing Quebec's <b>large</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>customers.</b> In his opinion, the high volatility of electricity markets and the transmission infrastructure physical limitations reduce the quantities of electricity that can be exported when prices are higher.|$|R
40|$|Natural gas is a {{relatively}} clean burning reliable source of energy as compared to other fossil fuels, and is used to heat millions of homes across Canada. In recent years {{the oil and gas}} industries have developed procedures for extraction of natural gas using unconventional methods that have resulted in proven vast reserves in Canada. These vast reserves are driving the cost of the energy source to record low prices. Choosing natural gas for space, water and process heating in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors can decrease the demand for electricity generation. This can improve the overall efficiency of energy utilization and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. (CAPP, 2012) With the reduced cost of this energy source coupled with recent technological improvements in the compression and transportation of natural gas, the ability to supply this abundant resource to remote small communities is becoming a reality. This project will consider existing technological methods of loading, transporting, and unloading methods for natural gas and determine the feasibility of supplying the product to the remote communities of Granisle, Moricetown, and Hazelton in North West British Columbia as a competitive alternative to propane and oil as a source of home heating. Without significant demand for energy and considering the cost of infrastructure and operations the option of supplying natural gas to a remote community is not viable. However, {{with the addition of a}} <b>large</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>customer</b> such as a mining operation the demand for the resource increases significantly thereby creating a viable project.

40|$|Abstract. Production {{outsourcing}} {{and transmission}} privatization are emerging {{trends in the}} European liberalized electricity market. Transmission privatization can be a valuable opportunity of expansion for power system operators, but also an economically convenient choice for <b>large</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>customers,</b> that can avoid the pay-tolls due to the public transmission grids by directly connecting their production plants to the drawing power plants through non-institutional lines (the so-called merchant lines). In this new scenario, the four-phase AC transmission can be an interesting alternative to the three-phase AC and DC power transmission. This paper discusses the main features of the four-phase connection and the role it could play in the European electricity market...|$|R

40|$|Electricity {{generation}} causes {{external costs}} {{because of the}} emission of air pollutants. Pricing an electric utility's service at {{the sum of the}} utility's marginal generation cost and marginal emission cost, however, is inefficient due to "bypass" by <b>large</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>customers</b> and the need to maintain the utility's financial viability. This paper derives the optimal tax on emission and efficient prices for retail service to two customer classes, one of which has the option to self-generate. These rules are used to evaluate the pricing proposals made in a recent rate case in California. These proposals are shown to be inefficient, in that they encourage over-consumption by residential customers who {{do not have access to}} alternative sources of electricity supply. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{electric}} transmission system in Texas {{has evolved over}} the years to its present state, in order to provide reliable service and reduce the amount of reserve capacity any individual utility needs to maintain.

40|$|The Swedish Electricity Act {{states that}} {{electricity}} distribution {{must comply with}} both price and quality requirements. In order to maintain efficient regulation {{it is necessary to}} firstly, define quality attributes and secondly, determine a customer's priorities concerning price and quality attributes. If distribution utilities gain an understanding of customer preferences and incentives for reporting them, the regulator can save a lot of time by surveying them rather than their customers. This study applies a choice modelling methodology where utilities and <b>industrial</b> <b>customers</b> are asked to evaluate the same twelve choice situations in which price and four specific quality attributes are varied. The preferences expressed by the utilities, and estimated by a random parameter logit, correspond quite well with the preferences expressed by the <b>largest</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>customers.</b> The preferences expressed by the utilities are reasonably homogenous in relation to forms of association (private limited, public and trading partnership). If the regulator acts according to the preferences expressed by the utilities, smaller <b>industrial</b> <b>customers</b> will have to pay for quality they have not asked for. ...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in technology and {{in the theory of}} electric utility operations and planning have led to an increased interest in rate and service options that are differentiated over short time intervals. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe the results from an analysis of a real-time pricing experiment recently conducted at Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation. The objective of the experiment is to measure the response of <b>large</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>customers</b> to dynamic, fully time-differentiated, marginal cost-based electricity rates over a broad range of industries.

The second policy is mandatory reduction of electricity consumption for <b>large</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>customers,</b> which impose the same reduction rate on all target users. The simulation results show that the latter has greater negative impact on the economy than the former. On annual basis, the former reduces real GDP by 0. 062 percent and the latter by 0. 085 percent when they both achieve the same overall power consumption reduction of 7. 385 percent. These results confirm the principle that a market-based approach to balance supply and demand is more efficient than a command-and-control approach...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{competition}} {{from various sources}} such as cogeneration and bypass has led many utilities to refocus attention on their <b>large</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>customers.</b> <b>Industrial</b> load shaping is a customized program involving cost-effective process modifications and operational changes which result in a restructuring of the electric load profile of individual manufacturing facilities. Both the customer and the utility should realize benefits from these changes. There are five generic load shaping categories: rescheduling operations, capacity additions, product storage, automation and flexible manufacturing and electrotechnologies. The customized nature of the program requires that the utility work with industry experts to help customers identify specific load shape opportunities. The remainder of this paper provides guidelines for utility planners interested in developing such a program. It begins with an overview of general objectives, technology alternatives, market evaluation and selection criteria, and program implementation and monitoring procedures. The paper concludes with two utility case studies...|$|R
