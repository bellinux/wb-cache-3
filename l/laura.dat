5|$|During the afternoon, {{satellites}} {{revealed that}} <b>Laura</b> {{had developed a}} deep warm core, a characteristic of a tropical cyclone, but the wind field remained subtropical in nature.

However, <b>Laura</b> was still {{under the influence of}} an upper-level low and cloud tops remained shallow. However, the cloud tops became colder overnight and <b>Laura</b> {{was on the verge of}} becoming a tropical cyclone by the morning of September30, but strong interaction with the upper-level low meant it was still subtropical. Despite moving over colder waters, a water vapor satellite image determined that <b>Laura</b> had separated itself from the upper-level low, signifying it had developed into a tropical cyclone. <b>Laura</b> was re-classified as a tropical storm at a relatively high latitude, 40.6°N. Not long after being declared tropical, early signs of an extratropical transition appeared. Cold air began to enter the storm on the west side and forecast models showed <b>Laura</b> becoming extratropical the next morning and non-tropical later the next day.|$|E
