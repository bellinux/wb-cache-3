40|$|We have {{combined}} a <b>laser</b> <b>scissors</b> and a laser tweezers to study, (1) {{the response of}} nerve fiber growth cones to laserinduced damage on single axons, and (2) localized microfluidic flow generated by laser-driven spinning birefringent particles. In the <b>laser</b> <b>scissors</b> study, sub-axotomy damage elicits a growth cone response whether damage is on the same or an adjacent axon. In laser tweezers study, the axon growth cones turn {{in response to the}} optically driven microfluidic flow. In summary, both the <b>laser</b> <b>scissors</b> and the laser tweezers studies elicit growth cone turning responses...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{tweezers}} and <b>laser</b> <b>scissors</b> are invaluable {{tools to}} manipulate cells on the micro and nano scale level. By integrating laser technologies with imaging and biochemical techniques, robust {{systems can be}} created to study various biological and biochemical processes. The purpose of this thesis is to describe two different optical methods used to study two cell-based problems. In the first experiment, optical tweezers are {{used to examine the}} effects of viscosity on sperm motility and energetics using a 1064 nm Nd:YVO₄ continuous laser. In the second experiment, <b>laser</b> <b>scissors</b> are used to study growth cone response from laser induced damage using a Vanguard Nd: YVO₄ second harmonic generator (SHG) 532 nm picosecond green laser. The proceeding sections describe the optical systems for each experiment as well as the methods used. Results of both studies are presented and discussed in detai...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{holography}} {{which enables}} quantitative phase evaluation during cellular microsurgery has been reported. <b>Laser</b> <b>scissors</b> {{have become an}} important tool that allows cell biologists to alter cellular structures in order to study their structure-function relationship. Digital holographic microscopy can be performed in real time, and it allows one to determine dynamic changes in the optical thickness profile of a transparent object with sub-wavelength accuracy. Quantitative phase imaging by digital holographic microscopy provided high spatial as well as temporal resolution to dynamic changes in cell thickness. A quantitative phase laser micro-irradiation system was even capable of evaluating dynamic changes in the sub-cellular structure (nucleolus) of a cell...|$|E
30|$|Hysteroscopic metroplasty for septate uterus {{seems to}} be a simple and {{relatively}} safe procedure, but several complications can occur either during the procedure or in subsequent pregnancy and childbirth. In a series of 600 metroplasties, Shveiky reported a 3  % rate of complications, including intra-operative perforations of uterus which occurred in 1  %. Two thirds of complications were related to the cervical dilatation or the insertion of the resectoscope [7]. Agostini analyzed the incidence of early complications in 2116 consecutive operative hysteroscopies. In his series, the rate of perforation resulted to be 1.6  %. After stratifying the data related to the uterine pathology, lysis of synechiae was the procedure with the highest relative risk for perforations, whereas other procedures, such as septa resection, registered a lower incidence of complications. Endometrial ablation, polyp resection, and myoma resection did not cause significant rate of complications whatsoever. Postoperative hemorrhage has been reported in less than 1  % of cases and was mostly self-limiting. The hemorrhage occurred more frequently in case of synechiolisys than in other procedures such as myoma or polyp ablation and septum resection [8]. Complications related to the procedure can manifest during successive pregnancy, labor, and delivery. According to Agostini, patients who underwent hysteroscopic metroplasty are at increased risk for fetal malpresentation at term, low birth weight infants, and delivery by cesarean section [9]. The dilatation of the cervix may disrupt fibers in the cervix which can lead to the cervical-isthmical insufficiency [10]. The incision at the fundus over a security range of 10  mm could cause weakening of the myometrial layer at the fundus, with a subsequent risk for rupture during pregnancy and labor [11]. Perforation of uterus during the procedure and use of monopolar current could represent a predisposing factor for rupture of the uterus during labor [12 – 14]. On the other hand, cases of uterine rupture after metroplasty have been described independently from used method for septum resection (bipolar or monopolar energy, <b>laser,</b> cold <b>scissors)</b> [12, 14, 15].|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} how optical tweezers {{can be incorporated}} into a multiphoton microscope to achieve three-dimensional imaging of trapped cells. The optical tweezers, formed by a cw 1064 nm Nd:YVO 4 laser, were used to trap live yeast cells in suspension while the 4 ′, 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole-stained nucleus was imaged in three dimensions by use of a pulsed femtosecond laser. The trapped cell was moved in the axial direction by changing the position of an external lens, which was used to control the divergence of the trapping laser beam. This gives us a simple method to use optical tweezers in the laser scanning of confocal and multiphoton microscopes. It is further shown that the same femtosecond laser as used for the multiphoton imaging could also be used as <b>laser</b> <b>scissors,</b> allowing us to drill holes in the membrane of trapped spermatozoa...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{tweezers}} and scissors are {{two common}} applications of laser micro-beams in biological research. Previously in our lab, {{there have been}} experiments that utilized both optical trapping and cutting, but in these experiments, optical trapping and cutting were performed at different time-points as the sample {{would have to be}} transferred from an optical cutting system to an optical trapping system or vice versa. In this project, we designed and built a combined <b>laser</b> <b>scissors</b> and tweezers microscope that (1) has two trapping beams and (2) uses a short pulsed tunable 200 fs 76 MHz 710 - 990 nm Ti:Sapphire laser for laser microsurgery. Both the position and power of all three beams can be independently controlled. Moreover, experiments were performed to test the ability of the system to trap and move whole chromosome or chromosome fragments inside living PTK- 2 cells as well as chromosomes in suspension. The optical scissors laser was used at 730 nm to successfully cut chromosomes inside live cells. The optical traps were able to move whole chromosomes or chromosome fragments (after cutting) inside live Nocodazole-treated cells and also chromosomes isolated in suspension. The optical traps were not able to move intact or cut chromosomes inside un-treated cells, cold-treated cells or cells where the kinetochore or microtubule spindle was damaged using the optical scissors. Our experiments show that chromosome's geometry and index of refraction allow for easy trapping. However, when inside cells, the microenvironment around them, especially the microtubule spindle cage, can prevent any trapping movemen...|$|E
