40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the problems associated}} with the rapid change of the rock stress-strain state in terms of increasing the rate of coal mining. Parameters of the roof collapse are determined depending on the rate of a <b>longwall</b> <b>advancing</b> under conditions of poor rocks. Statistical data are processed to obtain a general trend concerning the mining rate impact on the roof collapse. The statistical strength theory is applied to explain the increase in mined-out space and the size of hanging roof behind a coal face. Numerical simulation is carried out to determine a critical size of mined-out space that provokes a roof collapse. The area of yielded rocks is outlined using the criterion developed taking into account the rate of <b>longwall</b> <b>advancing.</b> A general regularity is obtained to determine the roof collapse parameters. The developed technics gives a possibility to predict the moment of general roof collapse at the initial stage of longwalling to prevent the negative effect of the rapid stress redistribution provoking joints propagation and intensive gas release. The estimation of the rock stress-strain state considering the rate of mining operations can be useful for tasks related to a new technology implementation. The statistical strength theory and failure criterion applied together provides adequate planning of mining activities and the assessment of natural hazards...|$|E

Instruments installed in the cross-panel entry pillars, backfill, longwall panel, and adjacent headgate entry were continuously monitored by a computerized data acquisition system as the <b>longwall</b> approached and <b>advanced</b> through the backfilled section of the panel. Data collected from these instruments were analyzed to determine the magnitude and direction of the secondary principal stress changes ahead of the longwall face, deformation and closure of the headgate entry, and stability of the cross-panel entry pillars and backfill. A three-dimensional, boundary element model was calibrated to accurately predict mining-induced stress changes and the distance they occurred ahead of the longwall face. As the <b>longwall</b> <b>advanced</b> through the backfilled entries, most of the mining-induced load was supported by the cross-panel entry pillars. The backfill provided stability for the roof and floor of the in-panel entries and also confined the entry pillars significantly improving their load-carrying capacity.

40|$|The {{practice}} of longwall mining is potentially an efficient and cost {{effective means of}} extracting coal from underground seams.

40|$|Impermeable {{geologic}} faults in {{the coal}} seam can cause intermittent production problems or can cause unexpected amounts of water or gas to issue from degasification boreholes. These faults also can impact methane emissions into the mine workings, especially if they hinder proper and effective degasification of the coal bed. They may also act as barriers for methane flow {{in the coal}} seam. Although this might seem beneficial for advancing mine workings, faulting may also cause gas pressure buildups and result in compartmentalization of the gassy regions from which large quantities of water and methane may rush into mine workings. This study uses reservoir simulations to illustrate the effects of impermeable faults, with and without throws, on the production performance of vertical and horizontal degasification boreholes. These boreholes were drilled from the surface to intercept the coal layer and fault and were assumed to produce methane two years prior to mining of the coal seam. <b>Longwall</b> <b>advances</b> and face position related emissions and reservoir properties were characterized using sector definitions along {{the path of the}} panel grids. This work numerically evaluates water and gas productions of each borehole and presents the effects and the impacts of impermeable faults on methane emissions due to an advancing coal face.

40|$|The Central Mining Institute has {{developed}} a method for forecasting the amount of seismic energy created by tremors induced by mining operations. The results of geophysical measurements of S wave velocity anomalies in a rock mass or the results of analytic calculations {{of the values of}} pressure on the horizon of the elastic layers are used in the process of calculating the energy. The calculation program which has been developed and adopted has been modified over recent years and it now enables not only the prediction of the energy of dynamic phenomena induced by mining but also the forecasting of the devastating range of seismic shock. The results obtained from this calculation, usually presented in a more readable graphic form, are useful for the macroscopic evaluation of locations that are potential sources of seismic energy. Forecasting of the maximum energy of seismic shock without prior knowledge of the location of the shock's source, does not allow shock attenuation that results from, for example, a distance of tremor source from the excavation which will be affected by seismic energy, to be taken into consideration. The phenomena of energy dissipation, which is taken into account in the forecasts, create a new quality of assessment of threat to the excavation. The paper presents the principle of a method of forecasting the seismic energy of a shock and the risk of damage to the excavation {{as a result of the}} impact of its energy wave. The solution assumes that the source of the energy shock is a resilient layer in which the sum of the gravitational stresses, resulting from natural disturbances and those induced by the conducted or planned mining exploitation, is estimated. The proposed solution assumes a spherical model for the tremor source, for which seismic energy is forecasted as a function of the <b>longwall</b> <b>advance</b> and the elementary value of seismic energy destroying the excavation. Subsequently, the following are calculated for the forecast of the seismic energy of a shock with the defined location of its source: value of the coefficient λ of dispersion/attenuation of seismic energy and the flux of seismic energy at predetermined distances r from the tremor source. The proposed solution for forecasting the seismic energy of tremors and the level of risk of damage to the excavation during the functioning of mining operations is helpful in the development of bump prevention. Changing the intensity of mining operations enables the level of the seismic energy induced by the operations both at the stage of its development and during the excavation of a seam using the longwall method to be “controlled”. The presented solution has been produced for an area disturbed by the mining of coal seam 510 in the hard coal mine, Jas-Mos. An original program developed by CMI was used for the calculations...|$|R
40|$|Longwall mining {{activity}} in the Ruhr coal mining district leads to mining-induced seismicity. For detailed studies the seismicity of a single longwall panel beneath the town of Hamm-Herringen in the eastern Ruhr area was monitored between June 2006 and July 2007 with a dense temporary network of 15 seismic stations. More than 7000 seismic events with magnitudes between – 1. 7 ≤ M L ≤ 2. 0 were detected and localized in this period. Most of the events occurred {{in the vicinity of}} the moving longwall face. In order to find possible differences in the brittle failure types of these events an association of the events to distinct clusters is performed based on their waveform characteristics. This task is carried out using a new clustering algorithm utilizing a network similarity matrix which is created by combining all available 3 -component single station similarity matrices. The resultant network matrix is then sorted with respect to the similarity of its rows leading to a sorted matrix immediately indicating the clustering of the event catalogue. Finally, clusters of similar events are extracted by visual inspection. This approach results in the identification of several large clusters which are distinct with respect to their spatial and temporal characteristics as well as their frequency magnitude distributions. Comparable clusters are also found with a conventional single linkage approach, however, the new routine seems to be able to associate more events to specific clusters without merging the clusters. The nine largest observed clusters can be tentatively divided into three different groups that indicate different types of brittle failure. The first group consists of the two largest clusters which constitute more than half of all recorded events. Results of a relative relocation using cross-correlation data suggest that these events are confined to the extent of the mined out longwall and cluster close to the edges of the active longwall at the depth of active mining. These events occur in lockstep with the <b>longwall</b> <b>advance</b> and exhibit a high b value of the Gutenberg–Richter relation (GR) of about 1. 5 to 2. 5 and consist of small magnitude events. Thus, these events represent the immediate energy release adjacent to the mined out area. The second group consists of clusters located either slightly above or below the depth of active mining and occurring at the current position of the longwall face within the confines of the longwall. They consist of generally stronger events and do not follow GR. This activity might be linked to the failure of more competent layers above and below the mined out seam resulting in larger magnitude events. Finally, one cluster represents seismic activity with a rather low b value below 1 and events located partly towards the north of the longwall which are delayed with respect to the <b>advance</b> of the <b>longwall</b> face. These events are interpreted as brittle failure on pre-existing tectonic structures reactivated by the {{mining activity}}...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Stress {{measurement}} and stress monitoring {{is an important}} task in mining geomechanics, because knowledge of the stress-strain state in a rock mass is the determining factor for the proper planning of roadway support and for the correct design of underground mining. This strategy is useful for ensuring mining safety, because increasing depth causes several issues, especially in areas with rockburst hazard, when roadways are loaded by the pressure ahead of an <b>advanced</b> <b>longwall</b> or by the stresses induced by destress blasting in overlying rock. Besides, mining is influenced by stress induced by previous excavations, mining edges in the overburden or abandoned workings in the same seam.

40|$|Great {{consumption}} of coal {{has transformed the}} underground coal mining industry with new features. The first is the increasing depth of cover of coal mining operations due to shallow resources being exhausted. Some operations overseas have been operated at an overburden of more than 1300 meters. The second feature is the intensified production concentration associated with the greatly improved <b>advancing</b> rate of <b>longwall</b> faces； a single face output has reached more than 10 million tonnes per annum. Deep operations are exposed to a high ground stress regime, high gas content, and coal and gas outburst risk. These issues cause changes in mine design, including {{but not limited to}} high demand for stone roadways， which are more stable than coal ones under high ground stress conditions. Stone gate roads are needed to accommodate cross measure drilling to protect coal gate drivage from the risk of high gas emissions and outburst hazards. Increasing <b>longwall</b> face <b>advancing</b> rate shortens the lifespan of panels. Further, it necessitates short longwall development time to achieve smooth panel succession. Improved coal gate development and stone gate development are essential to fulfil this requirement. A Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) is a kind of tunnel construction machinery which integrates the functions of excavation, ground support, mucking, lining， and surveying. It can achieve much higher heading rates than conventional drill and blast and roadheader methods, consequently, it has been proposed to be employed in underground coal mines to accommodate the requirement of high development rate...|$|R

This study, although site specific, provides information on the caving mechanism associated with longwall extractions so that strata behavior and its interaction with longwall face supports can be better understood. Two holes were drilled, approximately 550 ft apart along the center line of a longwall panel, from the surface to the coalbed approximately 650 ft below. Various downhole geotechnical instruments were used to monitor strata deformation. In addition, surface elevation surveys were conducted to differentiate between surface and subsurface activity. This report discusses the caving characteristics of the strata as the longwall panel approached and passed beneath the boreholes. Physical property data are also presented to demonstrate the relationship between caving behavior and local geology. Data show that immediate caving of strata above the longwall face occurred at a height less than 23. 5 ft and that strata behavior above longwall extractions is highly dependent upon lithology, with major disturbances occurring at weak lithologic zones...|$|R

The gate road along one side of the block is called the maingate or headgate; the road on the other side is called the tailgate.

40|$|Methane {{can be a}} {{significant}} hazard in coal mine longwalling operations and extensive methane mitigation techniques are employed by coal mine operators. Reservoir modeling techniques are used {{to better understand the}} liberation and migration of methane from the surrounding rocks towards the mine ventilation system. The caved rock behind the <b>advancing</b> <b>longwall</b> face, known as the gob, can contain high void ratios, providing high permeability flow paths to the methane. The gob is progressively compacted by the weight of the overburden, resulting in a reduction in the void ratio and associated permeability. Estimating the permeability distribution within the gob poses challenges due to its complexity. The authors have developed a new methodology to determine both horizontal and vertical variations in the permeability of the gob. Variations of the permeability in the vertical direction are based on a model of caving and block rotation, which considers the effect of block dimensions and fall height on the void ratio. Gob compaction by the overburden and associated permeability changes are determined from a three-dimensional geo-mechanical model which simulates the gob as a strain hardening granular material. The resulting three-dimensional permeability distribution in the gob is then transferred to a reservoir model. The paper demonstrates the application of the method and shows that reasonable results are obtained when compared to empirical experience and measurements...|$|R

Dust survey showed that chock movement is a significant source of dust exposure for shearer operators, accounting for about 47 % of total LW face dust make during the cutting cycle. 3 D CFD models have been developed to understand the behaviour of longwall dust particles from various sources including maingate (MG) chocks and stage loader/crusher. Modelling results demonstrated that much of the respirable dust particles generated from MG chock movements and the beam stage loader (BSL) will disperse onto the longwall face ventilation, contributing significantly to dust exposure levels. Dust control systems using ultra fine water-mist technology have demonstrated promising results in encapsulating respirable dust particles. A prototype water-mist based venturi system has been developed to firstly produce ultra-fine water droplets (5 - 15 μm) for suppressing the respirable dust particles from the MG chocks/BSL; and secondly induce a water-mist airflow with sufficient momentum to divert dust clouds off the walkway area along the face.

40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{monitored}} {{surface subsidence}} and water level fluctuations in 10 shallow observation wells above {{a series of}} four adjacent longwall panels in southwestern Pennsylvania, for about 4 yr. This study attempted to correlate {{the changes in the}} water levels within the observation wells to the measured vertical and horizontal ground movements associated with subsidence.

This paper evaluates the load transfer mechanics associated with the advancement of the longwall face into the pre-driven recovery room and the widening of the room to recover the longwall shields. The results show that the yielding of the panel fender produced uncontrollable convergence that caused yielding of the shields and stiff pumpable roof supports when the face was approximately 10 ft from the recovery room. The shields continued to yield until the face advanced into the recovery room. Convergence in the pre-driven recovery room typically reached 6 - 8 in once the pumpable supports yielded and shed load through a declining residual load capacity prior to being cut out by the longwall shearer. Roof deformations occurred beyond the 32 -ft horizon with total deformation ranging from 2 to 4 in, indicating that standing support was necessary to help control the span as the <b>longwall</b> face <b>advanced</b> into the pre-driven recovery room. Stability improved as the pumpable supports were cut out, thereby reducing the span between the shields and the outby pillars. In the end, the shields were successfully recovered under stable ground conditions. However, a disconcerting discovery was the load shedding of the outby pillars as the recovery room was mined into. It is postulated that this may be due to the progression of the rear abutment moving toward the recovery room as the panel fender and standing support in the recovery room yield and shed load. This behavior was not expected with a relatively narrow room that is fully supported with standing support. If this mechanism is indeed occurring, the width of the room and performance of the standing support becomes even more critical.

Displacement of the support was also measured to assess the support reaction to ground movements. Movement up to 12. 5 m (40 ft) into the roof was measured with sonic probes and multipoint extensometers. Borehole pressure cells were installed in the panel fender and outby pillars to evaluate load transfer. Shield loading was also assessed to determine the impact of the panel fender yielding on face loading. The results show that the yielding of the panel fender produced uncontrollable convergence that caused yielding of the shields and stiff pumpable roof supports when the face was approximately 3. 12 m (10 ft) from the recovery room. The shields continued to yield until the face advanced into the recovery room. Convergence in the pre-driven recovery room typically reached 15 - 20 cm (6 - 8 inches) once the pumpable supports yielded and shed load through a declining residual load capacity prior to being cut out by the longwall shearer. Roof deformations occurred beyond the 10 m (32 ft) horizon with total deformation ranging from five to 10 cm (2 to 4 inches), indicating that standing support was necessary to help control the span as the <b>longwall</b> face <b>advanced</b> into the pre-driven recovery room.

40|$|TITLE: AN IMPROVED ROCK MASS BEHAVIOR NUMERICAL MODEL AND ITS APPLICATIONS TO LONGWALL COAL MINING The rock mass {{constitutive}} models {{should include}} elastic moduli, strength and stiffness of intact rock {{as well as}} those of joints and geometric properties of joints. The post-failure behavior of intact rock and joints must also be specified. A direct application of the above comments is in longwall coal mining where the coal as well as the immediate roof and floor strata may undergo controlled brittle failure and associated weakening in tension and shear based on post- failure characteristics of the rock mass. In addition to controlled failure and weakening of the rock mass ahead and over the longwall face, large scale caving and compaction of caved materials occur behind the longwall face. Itasca’s Cave-Hoek three dimensional constitutive model has the ability to model longwall mining process that involve the above mentioned mechanism of rock mass failure and compaction. However, its testing to date is limited. The overall goals of research are two-fold: 1) Develop numerical modeling approaches that consider the caving behavior of jointed rock masses in design and analysis, and 2) Apply these techniques in designing stable chain-pillars and set-up rooms for longwall coal mining. Specific objectives are to: 1) Develop an improved constitutive model for prediction of post-peak behavior of rock masses typical of longwall mining in Illinois, 2) Implement the improved model for predicting gob material behavior using FLAC 3 D numerical code (most commercial codes do not have a built in model for gob material) and its effects on load transfer into gate entries, 3) Identify mechanisms of instability in setup rooms, 4) Develop alternate 3 - and 4 -entry set-up room geometries using 3 -D numerical analyses, 5) Implement and field demonstrate developed geometries, and 6) Monitor performance of implemented geometries through field monitoring. An alternative method to estimate the residual strength of a rock mass is developed. A yielded rock mass and a rock fill have several common characteristics including dilation behavior under low confinement and extensive crushing of contact points under high stress, which decrease dilation. The residual strength takes on an initial value in the immediate post-peak (corresponding to near-zero porosity) condition, then degrades to an ultimate residual strength that is lower as a result of bulking, a corresponding increase in porosity, and a drop in interlock under continued shear. The following comments summarize the key findings of this research: •	The model for predicting rock fill material shear strength was used as a residual strength criterion. A relationship for estimating Hoek-Brown residual parameters as a function of equivalent roughness of rock fill particles and basic friction angle was used. •	Macro-level measurements around setup rooms and gate entry development areas indicated that most of the observed ground control problems may be related to subsidence movements over the setup rooms area. •	Mechanisms that may be responsible for poor ground conditions in setup rooms and adjoining gate entries were identified. Collected field data and numerical analyses results tend to support the identified mechanisms. •	The integrated field monitoring and numerical modeling study here assisted the cooperating coal company to plan for additional supports in development entries impacted by the fault zone and in taking appropriate safety measures while the <b>longwall</b> face <b>advanced</b> toward the fault and crossed it...|$|R
