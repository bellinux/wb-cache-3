[...] Westfall also said once the band return home from touring, they were [...] "going to drop everything and start writing and doing pre-production full time." [...] At this point, the band had ten songs and were trying to condense them into five, then planning to write five more. Westfall said the band completed the final [...] "few songs when we were back home with Tom (Denney) and Chad (Gilbert)." [...] On the pace of writing, McKinnon said: [...] "It seems <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> fast thing that has happened but we've been constantly working on it the entire time." [...] On the songs themselves, he said: [...] "the pop-punk stuff has a darker edge to it. I wrote it like that, it's still pop-punk but with a darker edge". The album was influenced by Finch's What It Is to Burn (2002). The album [...] "came together song by song" [...] as McKinnon mentioned, with the band coming up with 15–16 song ideas. McKinnon stated in an {{interview with}} Rocksound that there's songs [...] "that didn't make this record that we're saving."

Further details were eventually supplied by entertainment reporter Michael Ausiello, who reported on April 19, 2011 that a [...] "beloved character" [...] would be dying in the [...] "season's penultimate episode", and one week later that the character was female. Morrison confirmed in late April that there would indeed be a death, and added: [...] "The episode right before the finale is called 'Funeral'. We were actually at a funeral home yesterday, shooting all day. It was a very taxing day." [...] The day the episode aired, Lynch revealed in an interview that Murphy had conferred with her before proceeding with the storyline: [...] "He took me aside at a party and said 'I want your blessing on this before we move forward.' I said, 'It sounds <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> great storyline.' It’s the thing that will break Sue Sylvester’s heart and get to where she lives."

2500|$|Associate Professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point G. Christopher Williams {{discussed}} {{the relationship between}} GLaDOS and Chell. In response to a quote by designer Erik Wolpaw that read [...] "we wanted you to have this very intimate connection with this AI that changes and evolves over time, {{leading up to the}} point that you betray her and do the most intimate act you can do with someone—murdering them in cold blood", he at first noted that [...] "on the face of it, this description of intimacy seems nonsensical", but also noted that [...] "a changing and evolving relationship with someone in authority over you that eventually leads to betraying them by violating their rules—is one that is an altogether familiar one". He used the parent-child relationship as an example of this and cited a metaphor by psychologist Sigmund Freud which Williams said was about [...] "murdering a parent in an effort to describe how children eventually would attempt to get out from under the wing of their parents". He wrote [...] "nothing can be as intimate, perhaps, as loving someone enough to follow their rules and then needing to “kill them” in order to escape that “game,” which makes this game feel like something more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> familiar relationship". He called her [...] "just one of many countless authorities that have explained to me the rules of a game, how to control myself, and then pushed me towards a particular goal of the computer’s design" [...] and that [...] "this is an experience that I have every time that I fire up my Xbox and describes the curiously intimate relationship between player and gaming system that emerges in single player gameplay". He further discussed that he had no idea that Chell's name was Chell or that she was a female because he recognized the character as himself. He wrote [...] "I cared about GlaDOS only because she was the one directing me. Oh, and then I really cared about her because she wanted to kill me".|$|E

2500|$|After {{the generic}} alien concept was finalized, {{each of the}} effects coordinators worked with a {{specific}} actor. Mahan chose to work with Mandy Patinkin, as well as Francisco's son. Rosengrant worked with Leslie Bevis who played Cassandra. Woodruff worked on Terence Stamp who played the part of Harcourt. In trying to emphasize {{the uniqueness of the}} [...] characters, Mahan commented, [...] "We wanted the audience to be able to recognize the actors immediately. They were all so good, {{it would have been a}} shame to cover them up completely." [...] Other effects coordinators like Gillis remarked, [...] "The actor who played Trent Porter, for example–Brian Thompson–was a really rugged guy, so he came off looking <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> tough character. On the other hand, Kevyn Major Howard–who played Harcourt's murderous henchman–had very delicate, boyish kind of features, so we used that quality to create a creepy juxtaposition." [...] While effects coordinators were struggling to finish the final design and full-scale production of the alien prosthetics, Hurd chose makeup artist Zoltan Elek to supervise the overall application. Elek had previously worked on the film Mask and the character Max Headroom. Elek insisted that the alien coloration be much more closer to human skin tones rather than the originally chosen yellowish pigment. Elek recalled his disagreement with Winston as Stan felt, [...] "... the aliens should be a totally different color than the humans, with a lot of yellows, blues and grays. To me, that scheme was too monstrous–in fact, we ended up using it on the Harcourt monster at the climax." [...] Another creative aspect of the makeup was the gradation between the principal and background masks. The crew of Alien Nation sought to avoid the same mistakes made in Planet of the Apes twenty years earlier. As explained by Gillis, [...] "We had what we referred to as 'A-B-C-D' makeups, ... The 'A' makeups were those custom designed for the principal actors, while the 'B' makeups were mix-and-match where we would recombine pieces from other actors to create a new character. Our 'D' masks–the ones furthest from camera–were overhead slip latex masks incapable of changing expression. The 'C' masks, however, were made of foam latex and could be glued down to get some expression from the characters in the middleground." [...] Application of the Newcomer makeup known as [...] "spuds" [...] or [...] "potatoheads" [...] on set, required four hours; a task which Patinkin described as being [...] "a pain in the ass." [...] Masks were manufactured in a production line to meet the enormous demand for the film. Mahan mused, [...] "We would pull the pieces out of the oven, fix them up, paint them and have them ready for pickup that afternoon to be taken to the set. The pieces were barely cold when Zoltan and his crew applied them." ...|$|E

60|$|It is true {{that the}} men who come to such a {{decision}} on such very superficial and imperfect observation may not be among the wisest in the world; but we have not now to contest their opinion—we are only pointing out how it is unconsciously encouraged by many women who have volunteered themselves as representatives of the feminine intellect. We do not believe that a man was ever strengthened in such an opinion by associating with a woman of true culture, whose mind had absorbed her knowledge instead of being absorbed by it. A really cultured woman, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> cultured man, is all the simpler and the less obtrusive for her knowledge; it has made her see herself and her opinions in something like just proportions; she does not make it a pedestal from which she flatters herself that she commands a complete view of men and things, but makes it a point of observation from which to form a right estimate of herself. She neither spouts poetry nor quotes Cicero on slight provocation; not because she thinks that a sacrifice must be made to the prejudices of men, but because that mode of exhibiting her memory and Latinity does not present itself to her as edifying or graceful. She does not write books to confound philosophers, perhaps because she is able to write books that delight them. In conversation she is the least formidable of women, because she understands you, without wanting to make you aware that you can’t understand her. She does not give you information, which is the raw material of culture—she gives you sympathy, which is its subtlest essence.|$|E

The point is that the message is an allusion to a matter known (so personal is it to myself) to no other individual in the world but me--not possibly either to the medium or to my sister-in-law; and an allusion so pertinent and initiated and tender and helpful, and yet so unhelped by any actual earthly knowledge on any one's part, that it quite astounds as well as deeply touches me. If the subject of the message had been conceivably in my sister-in-law's mind it would have been an interesting but not infrequent case of telepathy; but, as I say, it couldn't thinkably have been, and she only transmits it to me, after the fact, not even fully understanding it.

This I am accordingly doing very hard--with intervals of London inserted a good deal at this Season--I go up again, in a few days, to stay till about May.
