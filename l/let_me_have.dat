500|$|On December 16, 1956, American Broadcasting Company {{president}} Oliver E. Treyz announced Aubrey {{would immediately}} become the network's head of programming and talent. [...] ABC, the weakest {{of the three}} networks, was a perennial also-ran with a weak roster of affiliates and programs, something comparable to {{the early days of}} the Fox Network. Aubrey later said [...] "at that time, there was no ABC. The headquarters was an old riding stable. But I went because [...] Leonard Goldenson in effect said, 'Look, I don't know that much about TV, I'm a lawyer.' And he <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>have</b> autonomy." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon after Stefani joined No Doubt, she and bandmate Tony Kanal began dating: {{she stated}} {{that she was}} heavily {{invested}} in that relationship. Stefani commented that [...] "...all I ever did was look at Tony and pray that God would <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>have</b> a baby with him." [...] During this time, the band almost split up because of the failed romantic relationship between Stefani and Kanal. Kanal ended the relationship. Their break-up inspired Stefani lyrically, and many of Tragic Kingdoms songs, such as [...] "Don't Speak", [...] "Sunday Morning", and [...] "Hey You!", chronicle {{the ups and downs}} of their relationship.|$|E

500|$|James was {{the first}} {{documented}} African-American woman {{to come to the}} Utah Territory as a Mormon pioneer. [...] The family's first years in the valley were difficult: they lived in poverty and often did not even have the barest essentials for survival. Nevertheless, James exhibited remarkable charity and strength of character. In 1849, Eliza Lyman, a neighbor of hers, had no food to sustain her and her children until the harvest after she sent her husband on a mission to California. She records that [...] "Not long after Amasa had gone, Jane James, the colored woman, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>have</b> two pounds of flour, it being half of what she had." ...|$|E
500|$|Her first project {{there was}} to reprise her role as Clear Rivers in the sequel to Final Destination {{entitled}} Final Destination 2. In an interview with IGN, Larter explained her return to the franchise: [...] "When New Line {{asked me to come}} back, I thought it was great. They showed me the script and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>have</b> some input, and it was really terrific." [...] The film made US$90 million worldwide, to a mixed critical reception. A year later, Larter served as an associate producer of and starred in the thriller Three Way, and in 2005, she appeared in the independent political thriller Confess, and had a role in the romantic comedy A Lot Like Love, starring Amanda Peet and Ashton Kutcher.|$|E
500|$|In 1879, Sullivan, Gilbert and Carte were in {{the midst}} of a legal battle with the former {{directors}} of the Comedy Opera Company, which had produced H.M.S. Pinafore. Sullivan wrote to Hollingshead, saying: [...] "You once settled a precedent for me which may just at present be of great importance to me. I asked you for the band parts of the Merry Wives of Windsor... and [...] said, 'They are yours, as our run is over....' Now will you please <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>have</b> them, and the parts of Thespis also at once. I am detaining the parts of Pinafore, so that the directors shall not take them away from the Comique tomorrow, and I base my claim on the precedent you set." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{protagonist of}} the prior film, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), was killed {{off-screen}} in the film. Rumors indicated that Sawa had a contract dispute with New Line concerning the deduction of his salary; however, Perry resolved {{the issue with}} the statement that [...] "it had everything to do with narrative, and nothing to do with money or Devon’s unwillingness to come back." [...] Despite this, New Line reinstated Ali Larter to reprise her character as Clear Rivers. [...] "When New Line asked me to come back, I thought it was great. They showed me the script and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>have</b> some input, and it was really terrific," [...] Larter revealed. Larter indicated that Clear [...] " [...] gotten to a hardened place and tucked herself inside because she has felt so much pain in her life. By having herself committed to a mental hospital, she has created a safehouse so that Death can't get her." [...] Tony Todd also resumed his character as mortician William Bludworth. [...] "It’s the same character that we saw before that the audience loved," [...] Ellis expressed.|$|E
500|$|The two Dudley {{brothers}} {{were on the}} closest personal terms and Ambrose said of Robert: [...] "there is no man [...] knoweth his doings better than I myself", while Robert's recurrent phrase about Ambrose was: [...] "him I love as myself". Elizabeth, who liked Warwick, loved to joke that he was neither as graceful nor as handsome as his brotherand stouter as well. Lacking a grand London residence of his own, Warwick had his suite of rooms in the palatial Leicester House: [...] "the Lord of Warwick's bedchamber, the Lord of Warwick's closet, the Lord of Warwick's dining parlour". In the administration of their lands the brothers shared their estate managers and lawyers, while their local affinities consisted of the same gentry families. Privately, they were [...] "almost inseparable", passing time together whenever possible. When Robert Dudley had incurred the Queen's wrath while serving in the Netherlands as Governor-General in 1586, Ambrose wrote to him: [...] "if I were you ... I {{would go to the}} furthest part of Christendom rather than ever come into England again. ... <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>have</b> your best advice what is best for me to do, for that I mean to take such part as you do." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2004 interview, Simpson {{said that}} when she began seeking a {{recording}} contract record labels would not meet with her because they thought she just wanted [...] "to be like her sister". Simpson also said {{that she did not}} want to meet with Jessica's record label (Columbia) because she wanted to be signed because of her music, rather than her sister. She eventually signed with Geffen in 2003. As for her role as co-writer of the songs, Simpson has said that she had a lot of input lyrically: [...] "...I come up with the whole concept of the song. To me, writing is a very important thing. It's what I've always done and what I've always loved to do, and it was a big part of my wanting to do a record. So my label was amazing because they really <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>have</b> my hands in there. I got to write a lot." [...] Simpson said of making the album: [...] "It's a lot of work. From finding the right label to the actual recording, it took about nine months, then it was followed by the publicity work." [...] In an extensive list of thank-yous in the album's liner notes, Simpson includes Benji and Joel Madden of the band Good Charlotte, with whom she worked on the song [...] "Harder Everyday," [...] which was released as an international bonus track.|$|E

500|$|The filmmakers behind Twilight {{worked to}} create a film that was as {{faithful}} to the novel as they thought possible when converting the story to another medium, with producer Greg Mooradian saying, [...] "It's very important to distinguish that we're making a separate piece of art that obviously is going to remain very, very faithful to the book.... But at the same time, we have a separate responsibility {{to make the best}} movie you can make." [...] To ensure a faithful adaptation, Meyer was kept very involved in the production process, having been invited to visit the set during filming and even asked to give notes on the script and on a rough cut of the film. Of this process, she said, [...] "It was a really pleasant exchange [...] from the beginning, which I think is not very typical. They were really interested in my ideas", and, [...] "...they kept me in the loop and with the script, they let me see it and said, 'What are your thoughts?'... They <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>have</b> input on it and I think they took 90 percent of what I said and just incorporated it right in to the script." [...] Meyer fought for one line in particular, one of the most well-known from the book about [...] "the lion and the lamb", to be kept verbatim in the film: [...] "I actually think the way Melissa [...] wrote it sounded better for the movie [...] {{but the problem is that}} line is actually tattooed on peoples' bodies [...] But I said, 'You know, if you take that one and change it, that's a potential backlash situation. Meyer was even invited {{to create a}} written list of things that could not be changed for the film, such as giving the vampires fangs or killing characters who do not die in the book, that the studio agreed to follow. The consensus among critics is that the filmmakers succeeded in making a film that is very faithful to its source material, with one reviewer stating that, with a few exceptions, [...] "Twilight the movie is unerringly faithful to the source without being hamstrung by it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1958, Perkins {{moved to}} Columbia Records, {{for which he}} {{recorded}} [...] "Jive After Five", [...] "Rockin' Record Hop", [...] "Levi Jacket (And a Long Tail Shirt)", [...] "Pop, <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Have</b> the Car", [...] "Pink Pedal Pushers", [...] "Any Way the Wind Blows", [...] "Hambone", [...] "Pointed Toe Shoes", [...] "Sister Twister", [...] "L-O-V-E-V-I-L-L-E" [...] and other songs.|$|E

This appears to afford an admirable means of anti-parachute defence and it should surely be widely adopted. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>have</b> a plan." [...] This pillbox was adopted by the Air Ministry and became known as the Pickett-Hamilton fort.|$|E

2500|$|By Parks' account, Blake said, [...] "Y'all {{better make}} it light on yourselves and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>have</b> those seats." [...] Three of them complied. Parks said, [...] "The driver {{wanted us to}} stand up, the four of us. We didn't move at the beginning, but he says, 'Let me have these seats.' And the other three people moved, but I didn't."
