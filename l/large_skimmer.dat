50|$|When Jules Pierre Rambur first {{described}} the blue corporal in 1842, he assigned {{it to the}} <b>large</b> <b>skimmer</b> genus Libellula. There it remained until 1897, when James George Needham established the genus Ladona, and transferred the blue corporal (and several other species) to it. Taxonomists have disagreed since as to which genus the dragonfly should be assigned to, with some subsuming members of the genus Ladona into Libellula, and others maintaining the two genera. However, recent molecular DNA studies strongly suggest that Ladona is a monophyletic group which is a sister taxon to Libellula. The blue corporal has, in the past, been {{considered to be a}} subspecies of the closely related white corporal.|$|E
50|$|The {{great blue}} skimmer (Libellula vibrans) is a {{dragonfly}} of the skimmer family.With a total length of 50 to 63 mm, {{it is one}} of the <b>largest</b> <b>skimmers.</b> The immature forms of the skimmer are brown in color and mature forms are blue hued.Look for it near lakes, ponds, and slow streams in the eastern United States and rarely in southern Ontario.|$|R

50|$|Ekti is {{harvested}} from gas giants as their atmosphere is mostly Hydrogen. Hydrogen {{being the most}} abundant element in the universe {{can also be found}} in interstellar nebulae as well as planets close to and farthest away from the Sun. To extract the Hydrogen which in turn is converted to Ekti large Skymines are used. These plants are usually manned by Roamers, nomadic breakaway Earthers, but occasionally by Ildirans and the Hansa. In extracting Hydrogen from nebula <b>large</b> Nebular <b>Skimmers</b> slowly collect the Hydrogen for transport to be converted into Ekti, where it is shipped off. Harvesting of it is limited after gas giant aliens start destroying extractors.|$|R
50|$|The {{snowflake}} moray eel is {{not safe}} to keep with shrimp, crabs or lobsters, since crustaceans are their natural diet. However, {{they are safe}} to keep with most other invertebrates, including starfish, anemones and sea urchins. Snowflake morays are reef safe and will not bother corals, though these eels are messy eaters and will require strong filtration and a relatively <b>large</b> protein <b>skimmer</b> for the long-term health of any corals housed in their aquarium. The moray eel will likely consume very small fish such as damselfish. Compatible tankmates for the snowflake moray eel include other relatively large, aggressive fish, such as lionfish, tangs, triggerfish, wrasses, and possibly even other snowflake moray eels if they are both introduced to the tank at the same time.|$|R
50|$|The park {{contains}} two lakes {{which are very}} popular with fishermen. The larger lake has two islands and is inhabited by several large carps, bream and tench fishes {{as well as a}} <b>large</b> amount of <b>skimmer</b> breams, roaches and perches. The smaller lake has a path running around the perimeter making it ideal for match fishermen to set up with their seatboxes; it offers good amounts of Roach and Bream as well as several Carp and Tench.|$|R
50|$|The Beckett skimmer {{has some}} {{similarities}} to the downdraft skimmer but introduced a foam nozzle {{to produce the}} flow of air bubbles. The name Beckett comes from the patented foam nozzle developed and sold by the Beckett Corporation (United States), although similar foam nozzle designs are sold by other companies outside the United States (e.g. Sicce (Italy)). Instead of using the plastic media that is found in downdraft skimmer designs, the Beckett skimmer uses design concepts from previous generations of skimmers, specifically the downdraft skimmer and the venturi skimmer (the Beckett 1408 Foam Nozzle is a modified 4 port venturi) to produce a hybrid {{that is capable of}} using powerful pressure rated water pumps and quickly processing large amounts of aquarium water {{in a short period of}} time. Commercial Beckett skimmers come in single Beckett, dual Beckett, and quad Beckett designs. Well engineered Beckett skimmers are quiet and reliable but the powerful pumps used in <b>larger</b> Beckett <b>skimmer</b> designs can take up additional space, introduce additional noise, and use more electricity than less powerful pumps. Unlike the Downdraft and Spray Induction skimmers, Beckett skimmer designs are produced by a number of companies in the United States and elsewhere and are not known to be restricted by patents.|$|R
40|$|AbstractRetarding {{grid and}} Fourier {{transform}} {{ion cyclotron resonance}} (FTICR) mass spectrometry variable trap potential measurements are performed to determine {{factors that contribute to}} the kinetic energy distribution of ions formed in an electrospray source that uses a heated capillary for desolvation. The control of ion kinetic energies is achieved by manipulating the skimmer position in the postcapillary expansion and by varying the potential applied to the skimmer. The selective generation of either charge-dependent or charge-independent ion energy distributions is demonstrated. Charge-dependent energy distributions of electrosprayed ions are created by sampling ions near the Mach disk of the supersonic expansion and by using a <b>larger</b> diameter <b>skimmer</b> orifice; the FTICR spectra acquired under these conditions exhibit mass-to-charge ratio—dependent mass discrimination determined by the potential used to trap the ions. Charge-independent energies of electrosprayed ions are created by positioning the capillary adjacent to the skimmer to sample thermal ions and by using a smaller skimmer orifice to reduce expansion cooling; under these conditions ion kinetic energy is determined primarily by the skimmer potential and no mass-to-charge ratio—dependence is observed in the selection of optimum FTICR trapping conditions. The ability to select between proteins of different conformation on the basis of kinetic energy differences is demonstrated. For example, a 0. 4 V difference in trap potential is observed in the selective trapping of open and closed forms of the + 10 charge state of lysozyme. Finally, it is demonstrated that by operating the source under conditions which deliver a beam of ions with charge-independent energies to the cell, it is possible to obtain precursor and production signal magnitudes in FTICR spectra without charge-dependent mass discrimination...|$|R
5|$|Terns are {{normally}} monogamous, although trios or female-female pairings {{have been observed}} {{in at least three}} species. Most terns breed annually {{and at the same time}} of year, but some tropical species may nest at intervals shorter than 12 months or asynchronously. Most terns become sexually mature when aged three, although some small species may breed in their second year. Some large sea terns, including the sooty and bridled terns, are four or older when they first breed. Terns normally breed in colonies, and are site-faithful if their habitat is sufficiently stable. A few species nest in small or dispersed groups, but most breed in colonies of up to a few hundred pairs, often alongside other seabirds such as gulls or <b>skimmers.</b> <b>Large</b> tern species tend to form larger colonies, which in the case of the sooty tern can contain up to two million pairs. Large species nest very close together and sit tightly, making it difficult for aerial predators to land among them. Smaller species are less closely packed and mob intruders. Peruvian and Damara terns have small dispersed colonies and rely on the cryptic plumage of the eggs and young for protection.|$|R
