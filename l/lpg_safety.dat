40|$|Test firings with {{experimental}} {{liquid propellant}} gun systems {{indicate that the}} main concern {{standing in the way}} of practical application of LPG's is the possibility of unexpected explosions during start up when pressure is rapidly applied to the liquid monopropellant in the chamber. The phenomenon of many collapse-rebound cycles of imploding bubbles is theorized as the probable cause of explosions in LP systems. It may be concluded that <b>LPG</b> <b>safety</b> would be enhanced by choosing an LP with low bulk modulus, as well as low decomposition reaction rate, and that a benign looking DTA trace is not a sufficient quarantee of insensitivity to a pressure induced explosion. It is also shown that pre-pressurizing an LP charge, thus pre-compressing the bubbles near-isothermally, makes the system relatively insensitive to such pressure induced explosions. The applicability of this analysis to the question of acceleration induced explosion of explosive filled warheads is indicated...|$|E

The hydrouorocarbonR 134 a is nonammable, difcult to synthesize, has zero ozone depletion and high global warming. LPG refrigerants are highly ammable, occur naturally, have zero ozone de-pletion and negligible global warming. In Germany, most new refrigerators use R 600 a and many heat pumps and air conditioners now use R 290 with measured energy consumption 10 to 20 % lower than R 12, R 134 a or R 22. LPG mixtures have successfully replaced R 12 and R 134 a in over 100, 000 US car air-conditioners. Abboud (1994) measured the air-conditioner performance of ve popu-lar Australian cars with R 12 and then LPG mixtures in our laboratory. He recommended 60 % by mass commercial propane from Bass Strait and 40 % commercial butane. This gave typically 10 % more cooling than R 12 with satisfactory superheat and typically 8 % higher condenser pressure. Refrigerant property parameters show that R 600 a has half the leakage, pressure loss and condenser pressure and double the heat transfer properties of R 12 and R 134 a. This explains the energy consumption savings of R 600 a refrigerators. Redesign of heat pumps and car air-conditioners for R 600 a could yield greater benets. The insurance risk increment from LPG ammability for domestic re-frigerators is zero. The increment for car air-conditioners is negative {{because of the high}} cost of R 12 and R 134 a repairs. For large systems, ventilation of plantrooms and other <b>LPG</b> <b>safety</b> precautions can make insurance risk incre-ment zero or negative if required...|$|E
40|$|A vehicle fire {{occurred}} in a cross-harbour tunnel in Hong Kong in May 2000. In that accident, nobody was hurt, but the traffic was blocked for several hours, leading to huge economic losses. A general description of the fire is reported. Regarding the safety requirements of the tunnel, {{the performance of the}} fire fighting systems is reviewed. Fire safety management in that incident is discussed and recommendations are made to the authority for better fire safety management. To improve the outdoor air quality, the Government is trying to replace diesel vehicles with liquefied petroleum gas (<b>LPG)</b> vehicles. Fire <b>safety</b> aspects of running LPG cars in tunnels are also discussed. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
50|$|Autogas, {{also known}} as LPG, has {{different}} chemical composition, but still a petroleum based gas, {{has a number of}} inherent advantages and disadvantages, as well as noninherent ones. The inherent advantage of autogas over CNG is that it requires far less compression (20% of CNG cost), is denser as it is a liquid at room temperature, and thus requires far cheaper tanks (consumer) and fuel compressors (provider) than CNG. As compared to LNG, it requires no chilling (and thus less energy), or problems associated with extreme cold such as frostbite. Like NGV, it also has advantages over gasoline and diesel in cleaner emissions, along with less wear on engines over gasoline. The major drawback of <b>LPG</b> is its <b>safety.</b> The fuel is heavier than air, which causes it to collect in a low spot {{in the event of a}} leak, making it far more hazardous to use and more care is needed in handling. Besides LPG (40% from Crude Oil refining) is expensive than Natural Gas.|$|R
40|$|Currently,Universiti Malaysia Pahang {{has several}} {{laboratories}} which required Liquefied Petroleum Gas(LPG) and industrial gas {{to run the}} experiments and other work related {{to the use of}} these gases. The equipments which use LPG and industrial gas are required continuously supply of these gases. Therefore,the manifold system shall be install to ensure that the LPG and industrial gas can be supplied without interruption such as running out of the gas. The scope of research work is about the gas demand where gaseous used by various equipments at the lab and type of gas that use at FKKSA Laboratory and safety aspect based on DOSH, Malaysian standards and Suruhanjaya Tenaga Guidelines. Have several steps to reach the objective of this project such as estimation of load demand, calculation number of gas cylinder based on gas demand,network study to identify length of tube,study of suitable area to locate the gas manifold based on standards and code,assessment in term of safety at the gas manifold area,proposed the location and selection of material for the tubing system between gas manifold system and the equipment,design the layout using PDMS software and the last one is about safety analysis. Based on the calculation,the number of gas cylinder required is about 55 cylinders and this gas can use for long period time because the capacity of gas supplied is enough for all equipment at the FKKSA laboratory run without running out of gas. About the safety,several aspect should be considered such as <b>LPG</b> storage <b>safety,</b> safe handling of compressed gases, hazard,general precautions and manifold cylinder location. Then,the layout design of tubing system will show us the flow of gas and the parameters of tubing like the actual length of tube. As conclusion,manifold system is relevant to install at FKKSA laboratory because the running out of gas during run the equipment can be avoid and will not give the problem when run the experiment using the equipment related with the gas consumption...|$|R
