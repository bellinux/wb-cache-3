50|$|By far, {{the largest}} fishery using artisanal methods exists in Philippine and Indonesian waters where {{thousands}} of fishermen target yellowfin tuna around fish aggregation devices or payaos, although this fishery far exceeds the artisanal scale in terms of tonnage caught and the numbers of participants involved, and should more properly be considered a commercial handline fishery. General Santos City {{is the most important}} Philippine port for the <b>landing</b> <b>and</b> <b>transhipment</b> of catches. Catches that qualify as sashimi-grade are mostly shipped to the Japanese market; those that do not meet the grade are sold locally or canned. Elsewhere in the Pacific, small-boat fishers in Hawaii, Tahiti, and other Pacific islands supply local and in some cases foreign markets with fresh yellowfins.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} improve its {{shipping}} operations a major salt exporter needs to reduce costs, increase market share and improve customer service. This thesis examines the use of linear (LP) and nonlinear programming (NLP) {{as a means of}} solving a nonlinear transhipment problem associated with the export of salt. Tho feasibility of using a LP or NLP approach is explored, taking into consideration the computational time and useability of the models. To meet the demands of their customers the company currently uses heuristic methods to allocate varying size ships to different routes. To remain competitive the shipping options that are considered include the optimisation of vessel chartering for effective scheduling to customers, selection of vessel type, stockpiling <b>and</b> <b>transhipment.</b> This thesis examines the vessel Selection <b>and</b> <b>transhipment</b> options <b>and</b> provides for improvements. The NLP approach developed in this thesis is implemented under the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). It is expected the results will provide improvements to shipping methods and reduction of costs in salt exportation and will have applications to shipping problems in other industries...|$|R

In contrast to discrete lot-sizing models, {{the timing of}} stock receipts is variable and not confined to period boundaries.

A non-cooperative game model is then formulated for a two-ports-one-ocean carrier system. The optimal ports’ pricing and the carrier’s port-of-call decisions are derived. A centralized supply chain model is then discussed. The game model is further extended to uncertain demand situations.

The thesis links port development and growth to the divergent governance structures {{of these two}} ports that share similar geographic advantages. FCP {{is located at the}} north-eastern apex of the <b>transhipment</b> triangle <b>and</b> {{is an example of a}} wholly private port, which is owned and operated by Hutchison Port Holdings (HPH), a subsidiary of Hutchison Whampoa. HPH is in a unique situation where they also act as the local government and own large expanses of <b>land</b> <b>and</b> an airport. This unparalleled level of private self-determination has allowed HPH to develop FCP into a very successful transhipment facility. PPS, on the other hand, has been struggling while its competitors continue to gain despite its strategic position at the south-eastern apex of the "Caribbean Transhipment Triangle. " PPS, until recently, was owned and operated by Trinidad and Tobago's public port authority. Its restructuring program had lasted 13 years and did not meet the goals of the government. The traffic growth at PPS has paled in comparison to FCP, and the governance structures have played a key role in these differences.

40|$|Many {{small island}} states have {{developed}} economies that are strongly dependent on tuna fisheries. Consequently, they {{are vulnerable to}} the socio-economic {{effects of climate change}} and variability, processes that are known to impact tuna fisheries distribution and productivity. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the impacts of climate oscillations on the tuna-dependent economy of Seychelles. Using a multiplier approach, the direct, indirect and induced economic effects of the tuna industry expenditure benefiting the Seychelles' economy declined in 1998 by 58, 26 and 35 %, respectively (mean decline: 42 %), a year of strong climate oscillation in the western Indian Ocean. Multivariate patterns in tuna purse-seine vessel expenditures in port were substantially modified by strong climate oscillations, particularly in 1998. A cointegration time-series model predicted that a 40 % decline in tuna landings <b>and</b> <b>transhipment</b> in Port Victoria, a value commensurate with that observed in 1998, would result in a 34 % loss for the local economy solely through reductions in cargo handling expenditures. Of several indices tested, the Indian Oscillation Index was best at predicting the probability of switching between low and high regimes of landings <b>and</b> <b>transhipment,</b> which translate into impacts for the economy. It is hypothesised that a late 2006 /early 2007 climate oscillation was compounded by prior overfishing to produce a stronger impact on the fishery and economy of Seychelles. The effects of fishing and climate variability on tuna fisheries are complex and pose significant challenges for fisheries management and the economic development of countries in the Indian Ocean...|$|R
40|$|Transportation models (ordinary <b>and</b> <b>transhipment)</b> having {{certain types}} of {{capacity}} constraints on the flows between origins and destinations are studied {{from the point of}} view of transforming them into enlarged standardized (non-capacitated) models. Specifically constraints on the flow from disjoint and/or nested sets of origins to all destinations, and from any single origin to disjoint and/or nested sets of destinations are considered. Dual formulations are indicated for constraints on the flow to destinations from origins. In the case of a set of capacity constraints on the flow from each origin to each destination, the models proposed are easily seen to be of minimal dimension for any "standardized" version of such a capacitated problem. ...|$|R

The chief economic activity in the following century and a half was sugar cane processing, in engenhos (sugar mills). While Itamaracá was administratively separate, it operated as a political and economic subdivision of Pernambuco. With the rise of the gold economy in the late 17th century, Itamaracá became economically isolated.|$|R
