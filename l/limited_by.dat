5|$|During the November to May dry season, {{power output}} is <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> the river's flow rate, {{as seen in}} the {{diagrams}} on the right. When there is enough flow, power output is <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> plant generating capacity. The maximum power-output curves were calculated based on the average flow rate at the dam site, assuming the water level is 175m and the plant gross efficiency is 90.15%. The actual power output in 2008 was obtained based on the monthly electricity sent to the grid.|$|E

5|$|Similar {{to video}} fluoroscopy, X-ray {{microbeam}} studies use radiation to study movements of articulators. Gold pellets, 2 to 3mm in size, {{are placed in}} and around the mouth similar to the coils used in EMA. Radiation exposure is <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> using computer software to focus narrow x-ray beams, about 6mm2, on the pellets and track them as they move. Like EMA, x-ray microbeam studies are <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> the placement of the pellets. While able to minimize radiation exposure, the system is largely inaccessible as it is unique to the University of Wisconsin.|$|E

5|$|The most {{successful}} reagents employed in a stoichiometric fashion are shown below. The {{first is a}} bicyclic oxathiane that has been employed in the synthesis of the β-adrenergic compound dichloroisoproterenol (DCI) but is <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> the availability of only one enantiomer of the reagent. The synthesis of the axial diastereomer is rationalized via the 1,3-anomeric effect which reduces the nucleophilicity of the equatorial lone pair. The conformation of the ylide is <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> transannular strain and approach of the aldehyde is limited to one face of the ylide by steric interactions with the methyl substituents.|$|E
5|$|The overall cargo {{weight is}} the {{limiting}} {{factor in the}} design of an ore carrier, since the cargo is so dense. Coal carriers, on the other hand, are <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> overall volume, since most bulkers can be completely filled with coal before reaching their maximum draft.|$|E

50|$|Thus, the {{theoretical}} {{range of the}} jet-forming dispension is enclosed at its lower <b>limit</b> <b>by</b> the Weber-number and at its upper <b>limit</b> <b>by</b> the critical Reynolds-number. For practical applications, a high kinetic energy in the fluid jet is not desirable, because the jet probably would burst and spatter tiny droplets around the target point. Jet-forming dispensing systems are therefore usually operated {{in the area of}} lower Weber-numbers.|$|R
5|$|The size of {{a market}} assumes primary {{importance}} {{in the study of}} what induces investment in a country. Ragnar Nurkse referenced the work of Allyn A.

The original idea behind this was put forward by Adam Smith, who stated that division of labour (as against inducement to invest) is <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> the extent of the market.|$|E

5|$|After {{involving}} {{itself in}} the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War, France found itself financially ruined. Attempts to pass an economic plan to alleviate this in the Estates-General of 1789 led instead to the third estate—the commoners—forking to form the National Assembly. Succeeded in turn by the National Constituent Assembly and the Legislative Assembly, the various legislative bodies succeeded in rendering the monarchy constitutional, <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> democratic institutions. Attempts to remove the monarch entirely, although thwarted on 20 June 1792, led to the effective overthrow of Louis XVI on 10 August. On 21 October, France was formally declared a republic.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the losses it had suffered, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) had ceased to be an {{effective}} fighting force. Following a series of raids on the Japanese shipyard at Kure, Japan, the only major warships in fighting order were six aircraft carriers, four cruisers, and one battleship, none of which could be fueled adequately. Although 19destroyers and 38submarines were still operational, their use was <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> the lack of fuel.|$|E
5|$|Astrid was {{transferred}} to British ownership in 1984 when she was overhauled for the Astrid Trust, a private company <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> guarantee. The restoration was financially supported by Sir Jack Hayward, and also involved Rear Admiral Charles Williams. She was subsequently dedicated on 17 May 1989 by Princess Anne, following which she {{took part in the}} 800th anniversary celebrations of the Lord Mayor of London. Astrid then competed in the 1989 Cutty Sark Tall Ships' Race. She also competed in the 1990 and 1991 Cutty Sark Tall Ships' Races. Astrid made more than 16 crossings of the Atlantic Ocean as a training ship.|$|E
