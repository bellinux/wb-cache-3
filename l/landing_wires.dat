It had wings in three sections of hybrid construction; the center section integral with the fuselage had tubular steel spars, the front spar a simple tube with an external brace to the upper fuselage, and the rear spar {{in the form of a}} parallel chord truss. The two outer wing panels had wooden spars and alclad ribs, with diagonal rods bracing the wings internally. Alclad sheet was used to form the leading edges, and fabric covered the whole structure. When attached, the outer wings were braced with flying wires to the fixed conventional landing gear and <b>landing</b> <b>wires</b> to the upper fuselage.|$|E

2500|$|The {{wings of}} the Wib 2 were {{rectangular}} in plan and mounted without stagger or dihedral. [...] The single bays were defined by parallel pairs of inward leaning interplane struts, assisted by crossed flying and <b>landing</b> <b>wires</b> from the bases of the struts to the fuselage. Cabane struts supported the upper wing above the fuselage. The wings had thick, high lift coefficient sections, constructed around deep single spars built up from Duralumin sheet; the ribs were formed from cross-braced metal tubes. Ailerons were mounted only on the lower wing.|$|E
2500|$|The L.1 was {{a single}} bay biplane {{with a pair of}} tall, {{parallel}} interplane struts with flying and <b>landing</b> <b>wires</b> on each side. There was mild stagger and dihedral. [...] The wings used a thick airfoil and were straight edged, slightly tapered and square tipped; the lower wing had a slightly smaller span. The upper wing had a deep cut-out to provide some upward vision for the pilot, who sat under the wing just aft of mid-chord. The It had a fixed, conventional undercarriage with its mainwheels on a single axle mounted on a pair of V-struts to the lower fuselage longerons, assisted by a long tailskid, mounted well forward.|$|E
2500|$|Late in 1917 new, more {{powerful}} rotary engines were appearing and the Idflieg encouraged aircraft manufacturers to incorporate them into fighters. [...] The D.IX was LFG Roland's response. [...] Apart from its engine it had {{much in common}} with the earlier D.VI, D.VII and D.VIII designs. It was a two bay biplane, with straight wings of constant chord and blunt tips. [...] The upper plane was a little larger in both span and chord, so the two interplane struts on each side diverged slightly upwards and leant gently outwards. [...] Bracing was assisted by flying and <b>landing</b> <b>wires.</b> There were ailerons on the upper wing only, the first and third prototypes using the overhung, balanced type and the second with unbalanced ones ending at the wing tip.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{a single}} bay biplane with a single interplane strut on each side {{defining}} a bay braced with a single flying wire and a single <b>landing</b> <b>wire.</b> Both wings [...] were two spar structures; there was marked forward stagger but no dihedral The interplane struts were slender at the top but smoothly widened towards their feet, linking the upper rear spar to both lower wing spars.

They have constant chord and are of mixed construction, with single aluminium spars and drag struts, [...] plywood covered D-box leading edges, ply and spruce ribs and fabric covering. [...] There are externally interconnected Frise ailerons on both upper and lower wings. The latter are mounted on the lower fuselage longerons and single, faired, deep chord, I-shaped interplane struts position the upper wing well above the fuselage, assisted by central cabane struts.

2500|$|The Hanriot D.I was {{a single}} seat, Nieuport style mid wing monoplane, with {{slightly}} tapered, straight edged wings. <b>Landing</b> <b>wires</b> on each side met over the fuselage at a short pyramidal four strut pylon like that on the Nieuport IV. The single, open cockpit was under the pylon. [...] Like the Nieuport, it had a braced, broad chord tailplane, with a strongly swept leading edge, mounted {{on top of the}} rectangular section fuselage and a deep, broad chord rudder with no fin moving between the elevators. [...] The undercarriage used the standard Hanriot box with two longitudinal skids forming the lower edge of a cross-braced box, with four legs, a cross bar and an axle forming the other sides. The skids were upturned at the front to avoid nose-overs and the rear of the skid ran on the ground on landing, slowing the aircraft and preventing the tail from hitting the ground.|$|E
2500|$|The Ponnier D.III was {{a single}} seat, mid wing {{monoplane}} designed {{to compete in the}} 1913 Gordon Bennett Trophy race. Pairs of <b>landing</b> <b>wires</b> on each side met over the fuselage at a pyramidal four strut pylon and parallel flying wires went to the lower fuselage. An oil deflecting cowling, open at the bottom, surrounded the powerful double row, fourteen cylinder Gnome Lambda-Lambda rotary engine, which delivered [...] to a 2 m diameter propeller. The oval, open cockpit was placed at mid-wing, just aft of the pylon centre. It had a finless rudder at the extreme rear of the fuselage and a straight edged tailplane mounted on the upper fuselage ahead of it. The elevators were aerodynamically separate but interconnected, controlled by central wires. The D.III had a fixed, conventional undercarriage with mainwheels on a single axle mounted to the fuselage by pairs of wire cross-braced V-struts, plus a simple elliptical leaf spring tailskid.|$|E

2500|$|The H.31 was {{a single}} bay biplane with {{straight}} edged, parallel chord wings with slight sweep and essentially no stagger; {{the leading edge of}} the lower wing was marginally behind that of the upper one because its chord was a little less. It also had a slightly smaller span. A single, wide chord, airfoil section interplane strut on each side, with widened roots to lower interference drag, separated the bays; on each side pairs of flying wires and <b>landing</b> <b>wires</b> provided cross bracing between these struts and the fuselage. The wings were built around twin Duralumin box main spars, with metal and wood ribs. [...] There were ailerons on the upper planes. [...] Neither wing was directly fuselage mounted but instead held off by pairs of N-form struts on each side. Those joining the lower wing to the low-mid fuselage were longer than those of the cabane and the lower forward component was itself a close pair. Both upper and lower wings had the common cut-outs to improve the pilot's vision but the H.31 had a forward, full chord slot between the upper wings as well.|$|E
2500|$|Around this time, various French {{manufacturers}} like Voisin and Farman {{were hoping}} to improve the stability of aircraft against gusts by using wings that were partly flexible like those of birds and the Caudron Types M and N also included this feature. Each wing had two steel tube, wood filled spars, one {{at the leading edge}} and the other [...] aft, a little behind one third chord, with ash ribs and wire bracing. The number of ribs varied between 10, 11 and 12 and they were conventionally rigid between the spars. Behind the rear spar the upper part of each rib was also rigid, ending at about 70% chord; the lower part was completed by a thin, flexible extension strip for about 60% of the chord. The wing was then fabric covered, though the flexible portion was only covered on the upper side. The wings were supported from above by <b>landing</b> <b>wires</b> from a four-legged pylon above the fuselage and by lifting wires from another below, shorter on the Type N than on the Type M. On the latter the tip of the lower pylon was braced by a horizontal, longitudinal strut to the centre of the undercarriage frame. Lateral control was by wing warping.|$|E
2500|$|The Grunau 9 {{had almost}} rectangular, two spar, wooden structured, two piece wings with fabric {{covering}} everywhere except the leading edges, which were plywood covered. Short, simple rectangular, cropped ailerons reached {{to the square}} wing tips. [...] They were attached to the upper fuselage beam with their leading edges at the forward sloping member and a chordwise gap between their roots. [...] Each wing was braced {{with a pair of}} <b>landing</b> <b>wires</b> from the apex of the A-frame to the upper wing at outboard points on the forward and aft spars and by pairs of flying wires from [...] below the wing to the lower horizontal A-frame member. There were also bracing wires from the wing rear spars to the tail to retrain its lateral movement. [...] The vertical rudder hinge {{was at the end of}} the fuselage, with a rudder that was rectangular apart from its sloping lower edge. [...] A triangular tailplane was mounted on the upper, horizontal fuselage beam with the elevator hinge in line with the rudder's. [...] The rectangular elevators therefore required a cut-out for rudder movement; like the rudder and tailplane, the elevators were fabric covered. [...] A fin was provided by fabric covering the near triangular area of the rear fuselage between the rudder hinge, the upper and lower beams and the diagonal between them.|$|E

2500|$|Structurally the HD.15 was an {{all-metal}} aircraft, {{though the}} flying surfaces and rear fuselage were fabric covered. [...] The wings had rectangular section Duralumin box spars, assisted by tubular auxiliary spars forward and aft of them. In plan they were straight edged, unswept and of constant chord and thickness. The lower wing had a slightly greater span. [...] The wing tips were essentially square, {{except that the}} horn balances of the short span ailerons on both upper and lower wings projected beyond. There was no stagger. The HD.15 had unusual interplane struts: instead of the familiar division of the wing into bays by struts braced with crossed flying and <b>landing</b> <b>wires,</b> it had a rigid, spanwise, X-shaped strut on each side, linking {{the upper and lower}} spars. [...] Vertical wires maintained the interplane gap and the location of the crossing point, which was below mid-gap. The inboard end of each upper X-strut met the wing {{at the top of the}} aft member of a pair of cabane struts. [...] The lower ends of the X-strut [...] met the wing further outboard, at the bottom of a strut that ran to the upper fuselage longeron. [...] The empennage of the HD.15 was like those used on earlier Emile Dupont designs, with a braced, rectangular tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage and a small, curved edged fin. [...] Both carried balanced control surfaces, the elevator's balances projecting beyond the tailplane tips, and the low but broad chord, curved edge, deep rudder reaching down to the keel and moving within an elevator cut-out.|$|E

(The wires connecting a basket or gondola to a balloon are also called flying wires.) Thinner incidence wires are sometimes run diagonally between fore and aft interplane struts to stop the wing twisting and changing its angle of incidence to the fuselage. In some pioneer aircraft, wing bracing wires were also run diagonally fore and aft to prevent distortion under side loads such as when turning. Besides the basic loads imposed by lift and gravity, bracing wires must also carry powerful inertial loads generated during manoeuvres, such as the increased load on the <b>landing</b> <b>wires</b> at the moment of touchdown.|$|E

The high-mounted delta wing of the aircraft had a wingspan of only 21 ft and was capped with flat endplates. The nose of the aircraft had a hook on the underside and a short pole for gauging distance from the trailer. The hook was used to hang the Vertijet from the vertical trailer bed landing platform. After the aircraft was secured vertically, the trailer was lowered to horizontal and then used to transport the aircraft on the ground. Pitch and yaw control in hover were provided by vectored engine thrust. Roll control was provided by [...] "puffer" [...] jets (also known as [...] "jet reaction control") mounted outboard of the wingtip endplates.
