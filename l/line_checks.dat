40|$|Modern {{airline pilots}} are tasked every flight with the safe and {{efficient}} operation of highly automated airliners in today’s complicated global and economic environments. Airlines have developed {{standard operating procedures}} (SOP) for normal, abnormal, and emergency operations. These procedures serve as a script for crews to follow. These procedures are designed by airlines to ensure that aircraft are operated in the (1) most safe, (2) most efficient, and (3) most on-time manner. For the most part pilots will comply with SOP, but when they (1) don 9 t agree with SOP, (2) don 9 t understand SOP or {{the risks associated with}} not complying with SOP, or (3) don 9 t feel adequately trained to know what SOP is, it is difficult to motivate them to comply. Airlines have the means to measure compliance through Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) and Line Operations Safety Audit (LOSA). The purpose of this research is to determine if increased understanding, knowledge and awareness of the risk of noncompliance with SOP increase airline pilots’ compliance with SOP. This research explores data from <b>line</b> <b>checks</b> at a major US airline that was gathered in pursuit of understanding what drives SOP compliance. Baseline data was gathered and analyzed to determine the top 12 noncompliant items. The airline provided training during the Human Factors module in each pilots recurrent training on Pilot Intentional Non Compliance (PINC). The training including developing pilots’ understanding that while most Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) reports grant pilots immunity from legal action, if a violation is labeled PINC, ASAP protections do not apply. Further <b>line</b> <b>checks</b> were conducted after the pilots received the PINC training. The top 12 noncompliant items from the pre-PINC training group were compared to the same 12 items in the post-PINC training group. Significant improvement in SOP compliance was found in six of the 12 items tested. The results established that training pilots on the risk of PINC did significantly increase SOP compliance...|$|E

40|$|Higher wheat prices, {{performance}} {{potential of}} hybrids {{and the availability}} of new next generation sequencing have sparked a renewed interest in the development of hybrid wheat. Floral characteristics and heterosis {{are an integral part of}} hybrid wheat studies for discovering compatible parents with desirable traits for hybrid wheat production. The objectives of this study were to 1) screen TAM germplasm for desirable floral characteristics and characterize the best male and female candidates for the beginning of a hybrid wheat program, and 2) to estimate heterosis in F 2 generations as a proxy to F 1. Advanced breeding lines (1, 770) from TAM germplasm, such as Amarillo Preliminary (AP 1 -AP 10), South Texas Preliminary (STP 1 -STP 4), South Texas Observations (SOBS), and Amarillo Observations (AOBS) were screened for floral characteristics to select parents for hybrid wheat crossing. The observations included studying the key male and female floral traits that will enhance the magnitude of cross-pollination. The male characteristics measured were anther exsertion, length and width, and female characteristics were glume angle and stigma size, featheriness duration and exsertion. Heading date, anthesis, and plant height were also measured. The study was conducted in two years: 2014 and 2015. Initial screening on 1, 770 lines was performed during 2014 on a single replication. About 6 % of the lines (97 out of 1, 770) were selected from the 2014 floral screening and tested for repeatability in 2015. The 97 lines were grown in two replicates, and out of 97 lines, 17 (18 %) were selected for hybrid wheat crossing. Heterosis in TAM F 2 populations College Station F 2 (CF 2) and Amarillo F 2 (AF 2) for yield and its components were studied as a proxy to the F 1. Results showed that most of the F 2 populations tend to have a higher yield and yield components than the inbred <b>line</b> <b>checks.</b> Though some heterosis is lost in the F 2 due to segregation and inbreeding, the presence of superiority is a good sign of vigor in the previous generation...|$|E
