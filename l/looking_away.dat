According to the American Automobile Association (AAA), distraction plays a factor in 60% of moderate to serious teen car crashes.

5|$|In 1836 {{architect}} John Harper {{arranged a}} small exhibition in York {{of works by}} modern artists, which included 11 Etty paintings. This included the first public showing of Venus and her Doves, which had been commissioned by Daniel Grant. Although the exhibition broke even it met with little public interest, and no further Etty retrospectives were held for some years. Harper did {{take the opportunity to}} buy Etty's A Family of the Forest (also known as Flowers of the Forest), which had failed to sell at the 1836 Summer Exhibition. A Family of the Forest illustrates a passage from the Ancient Greek poem Theogony, dealing with the Golden Age before humanity suffered pain, misery or the need to work. The setting sun in the background and the man <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> from the woman and child, and instead into the distance, signify his knowledge that his days of ease are coming to an end.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi. It opens with Hamasaki watching her previous music videos on several television screens. Sitting in a small room, she exits it and finds {{a large amount of}} fans and paparazzi bombarding her; scenes interspersed through the main plot feature her looking towards a mirror. Following the first chorus, Hamasaki is shown riding through Tokyo city, including her appearance at a recording studio singing the song, and on top of a skyscraper at night. The frames subsequently re-appear throughout the visual, with it ending with a blurry shot of Hamasaki <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> from the mirror, and the TV screens from the first shot displaying the logo of Avex Trax. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album A Best (2016). It was additionally used as the theme for Japanese television show Semi Double (1999).|$|E

25|$|Using this convention, {{polarization}} {{is defined}} {{from the point}} of view of the source. When using this convention, left or right handedness is determined by pointing one's left or right thumb away from the source, in the same direction that the wave is propagating, and matching the curling of one's fingers to the direction of the temporal rotation of the field at a given point in space. When determining if the wave is clockwise or anti-clockwise circularly polarized, one again takes the point of view of the source, and while <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> from the source and in the same direction of the wave’s propagation, one observes the direction of the field’s temporal rotation.|$|E

500|$|French art {{historian}} Françoise Cachin notes that Gauguin designed both Self-Portrait with Halo and Snake and its companion piece Portrait of Jacob Meyer de Haan [...] as a caricature. In his Self-Portrat, Gauguin appears against a red background with a halo {{above his head}} and apples hanging beside him as he holds a snake in his hand with {{what appear to be}} either plants or flowers in the foreground. [...] Curator Philip Conisbee observes the religious symbolism in the images, noting that the [...] "apples and snake refer to the Garden of Eden, temptation, sin, and the Fall of Man." [...] Gauguin divides the canvas in half, painting himself as both saint and sinner, reflecting his own personal myth as an artist. In the top portion of the painting, Gauguin is almost angelic with the halo, <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> from the apples of temptation. [...] In the bottom portion, he holds the snake, completing the duality.|$|E

500|$|One well-supported {{theory of}} self-regulation, called the Cognitive-affective {{personality}} system (CAPS), suggests that delaying gratification results from {{an ability to}} use [...] "cool" [...] regulatory strategies (i.e., calm, controlled and cognitive strategies) over [...] "hot regulatory strategies (i.e., emotional, impulsive, automatic reactions), when faced with provocation. In [...] "hot" [...] processing, a person thinks intently about the object causing temptation, and especially about its most appealing elements, and is subsequently less able to resist the immediate reward. The use of cool strategies can translate to more control over behavior. Effective [...] "cool" [...] strategies involve distraction and restructuring {{the perception of the}} tempting stimulus to make it seem less appealing. For example, in one study of pre-adolescent boys with behavioral problems, the boys showed a reduction in verbal and physical aggression when they used [...] "cool" [...] strategies, such as <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> or distracting themselves.

Throughout the first verse and chorus, Lovato dances around on stage with Manhattan Bridge visible in the background.

He thought it was important to [...] "keep these characters (Patty and Selma) alive." [...] The animators had trouble with the size of the characters' pupils during the season. In this episode, they are noticeably larger. When the family watches the video will, Julie Kavner did five voices in the scene. When Great Aunt Gladys shows off her collection of potato chips, the scene was inspired by Myrtle Young, who appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. During an interview with David Letterman, Young said she was working in quality control at a potato chip factory, and collected potato chips that looked like, amongst other things, famous people. The scene where Homer ate a chip is a reference to the Johnny Carson appearance, where, whilst Young was <b>looking</b> <b>away,</b> Johnny ate a chip from a separate bowl (not of the collection), Young, thinking Johnny had ate a chip from her collection, was shocked, before Johnny cleared up the misuderstanding. Jub-Jub made his debut appearance in this episode; the name of the iguana Jub-Jub came from Conan O'Brien.|$|E

First, she meets Rihanna {{in the living room}} and catches her eye. In the next scene, the couple are shown on top of a table with ultraviolet lighting and Casta rubs her head on Rihanna's legs. They are then shown outside the castle and Rihanna falls to the ground in despair while Casta looks on, letting her long hair fall loose and standing seductively. Soon, they are shown in a room full of male dancers and Rihanna begins to feel more comfortable around her admirer.
