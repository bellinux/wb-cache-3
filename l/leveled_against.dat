5|$|The {{game was}} a major {{commercial}} failure, and Looking Glass ceased its self-publishing operations after its release. Despite this, it was generally well reviewed by critics, who praised Jim McKay's commentary and the game's graphics and atmosphere. Criticism was <b>leveled</b> <b>against</b> its lack of multiplayer or course creation functionality, and some reviewers found fault with its brevity.|$|E
5|$|Youngs {{was elected}} to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972 by the Veterans Committee. His {{election}} was not without controversy, however, as the Veterans Committee consisted of his former teammates, and charges of cronyism were <b>leveled</b> <b>against</b> the committee.|$|E
5|$|In the announcement, McHugh {{denied that}} the move was made in {{response}} to several high-profile misconduct allegations <b>leveled</b> <b>against</b> soldiers from the base in the Afghanistan War such as the Maywand District murders and the Kandahar massacre. Major General Stephen R. Lanza, the Army's chief of public affairs, was tapped to lead the division. It activated on the base on 10 October 2012.

5|$|Undaunted by {{this lack}} of {{confidence}} from his peers, Johnson continued to campaign to retain his office. Although his campaign was more vigorous than that of Van Buren, his behavior {{on the campaign trail}} raised concern among voters. He made rambling, incoherent speeches. During one speech in Ohio, he raised his shirt in order to display to the crowd the wounds he received during the Battle of the Thames. Charges he <b>leveled</b> <b>against</b> Harrison in Cleveland were so poorly received that they touched off a riot in the city.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the criticisms <b>leveled</b> <b>against</b> {{scientific}} jury selection—that it lets lawyers stack juries and distorts the effect of money—several reforms have been proposed. One common reform proposal is the elimination of peremptory challenges. Supreme Court precedent already forbids use of peremptories (peremptory challenges) to exclude jurors based solely on their race or sex. Proponents argue that doing away with peremptories altogether will eliminate the perceived and real injustice of permitting lawyers to eliminate jurors dispositionally unfavorable to them without a challenge for cause argument in open court. Opponents counter that attorneys cannot always ferret out actionable evidence of juror bias, particularly {{in the context of}} a limited voir dire.|$|E
5|$|In mid-January, when Earp ally Rickabaugh {{sold the}} Oriental Saloon to Earp adversary Milt Joyce, Wyatt sold his {{gambling}} concessions at the hotel. The Earps also raised some funds from sympathetic business owners in town. On February 2, 1882, Wyatt and Virgil, {{tired of the}} criticism <b>leveled</b> <b>against</b> them, submitted their resignations to Dake, who refused to accept them because their accounts had not been settled. On the same day, Wyatt {{sent a message to}} Ike Clanton that he wanted to reconcile their differences, which Clanton refused. Clanton was also acquitted that day of the charges against him in the shooting of Virgil Earp, when the defense brought in seven witnesses who testified that Clanton was in Charleston {{at the time of the}} shooting.|$|E

50|$|In June 1964, Fonseca and Víctor Tirado {{were arrested}} in Managua. The two (along with four others) were accused of {{plotting}} to assassinate Anastasio Somoza Debayle.

5|$|The Republican nominee, Poling, was a Baptist preacher with a {{national}} reputation for integrity whom GOP leaders hoped would help deflect the corruption charges <b>leveled</b> <b>against</b> the machine.

Poling, {{was one of the}} Four Chaplains lost aboard the SS Dorchester in World War II, and Poling served as pastor at the chapel erected in their memory. Poling was challenged in the primary by Walter P. Miller, a businessman who had the backing of independent Republicans. The ward leaders swung their support to Poling, who won by a six-to-one margin.|$|E
5|$|On 19 June 2013, Wizkid and his {{management}} were questioned by {{men from the}} Nigeria Police Force. Duping charges were <b>leveled</b> <b>against</b> them {{by a group of}} UNILAG students. The students claimed that Wizkid agreed to perform at the UNILAG Sports Centre on 21 May 2013 for a total sum of ₦500,000. They also claimed that he didn't show up for the show and didn't return their money. After conducting a thorough investigation, Police determined that Unilag students were bamboozled by con artists pretending to be affiliates of E.M.E. In the aforementioned interview with Showtime Celebrity, Wizkid commented on the events that transpired after the accusations. He told the media that the police were investigating the case. The masterminds behind the impersonation were later detained by law enforcement agents in Lagos. In addition to duping Unilag students, the culprits set up fake email and social media accounts. Wizkid also elaborated on how one can go about booking him.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} started in May 2012, shortly {{after the release of}} XIII-2s final piece of DLC, and was {{unveiled}} at a special 25th Anniversary Event for the Final Fantasy series in September that year. Most of the previous games' key creative minds and developers returned, and it was developed by Square Enix's First Production Department, with developer tri-Ace helping with the graphics. The development team wanted the game to bring a conclusive end to the story of both Lightning and the XIII universe, and to address criticisms <b>leveled</b> <b>against</b> the last two games.

5|$|The only {{television}} series Murphy starred in was the 1961 Whispering Smith {{in which he}} played the title character. Based on the film of the same name, the show was about a 19th-century Denver railroad investigator. Episodes were gleaned from real-life cases of the Denver Police Department.

25|$|Critics of the Barrow and Tipler SAP {{claim that}} it is neither {{testable}} nor falsifiable, and thus is not a scientific statement but rather a philosophical one. The same criticism has been <b>leveled</b> <b>against</b> the hypothesis of a multiverse, although some argue that it does make falsifiable predictions. A modified version of this criticism is that we understand so little about the emergence of life, especially intelligent life, that it is effectively impossible to calculate the number of observers in each universe. Also, the prior distribution of universes {{as a function of}} the fundamental constants is easily modified to get any desired result.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to criticisms that contemporaries such as Belisario Bulgarini <b>leveled</b> <b>against</b> his first effort, Mazzoni wrote the more extensive {{and more sophisticated}} On the Defense of the Comedy of Dante.
