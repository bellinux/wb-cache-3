25|$|The <b>laughing</b> <b>falcon</b> (Herpetotheres cachinnans), {{also called}} the snake hawk (erroneously, since {{it is not a}} hawk), is a {{medium-sized}} bird of prey in the falcon family (Falconidae), {{the only member of the}} genus Herpetotheres. This Neotropical species is a specialist snake-eater. Its common and scientific names both refer to its distinctive voice.|$|E
25|$|The {{flight is}} slow, with quick, shallow wingbeats {{interspersed}} with glides; the bird rarely if ever soars. When it lands, it will jerk the tail forcefully {{just like a}} wagtail. A <b>laughing</b> <b>falcon</b> frequently and often conspicuously stays on a perch for hours, sitting upright and observing the ground alertly, sometimes flicking its tail or nodding, or moving around a bit on its perch with slow, cautious little steps. It is generally peaceful and unlike other falcons will not harm smaller birds.|$|E

40|$|T. H. Worthy* The Quaternary {{terrestrial}} faunas, primarily birds, {{of three}} inland districts in Otago, South Island, New Zealand are described. The three areas (North Otago, Central Otago and near Wanaka) {{differ in their}} present topography and climate, and their palaeofaunas are also different: that of North Otago is considerably more diverse than either of the others. The differences are related to habitat diversity and climate. In Otago, 62 native species of birds, plus greater and lesser short-tailed bats Mystacina spp., tuatara Sphenodon, Duvaucel's gecko Hoplodactylus duvaucelii, common gecko H. maculatus, and indeterminate skinks Oligosoma spp, are recorded from fossil deposits. Most deposits are of Holocene age. Swamp-miring, predation by <b>laughing</b> owls and <b>falcons,</b> and pitfall processes were responsible for accumulating the fossils.

50|$|The {{composition}} of Falconidae is disputed, and Polyborninae is not {{featured in the}} American Ornithologists' Union checklists for North and South American birds that are produced by its Classification Committees (NACC and SACC). The Check-list of North American Birds considers the <b>laughing</b> <b>falcon</b> a true falcon (Falconinae) and replaces Polyborinae with Caracarinae and Micrasturinae. On the other hand, the Check-list of South American Birds classifies all caracaras as true falcons and puts the <b>laughing</b> <b>falcon</b> and forest falcons into the subfamily Herpetotherinae.|$|E
50|$|One common {{approach}} uses two subfamilies Polyborinae and Falconinae.The first contains the caracaras, forest falcons, and <b>laughing</b> <b>falcon.</b> All species {{in this group}} are native to the Americas.|$|E
50|$|The genus Caracara Merrem 1826 was {{previously}} known as Polyborus Vieillot 1816. Hence, the differing subfamily names Polyborinae or Caracarinae.

50|$|The clade Falconidae is {{composed}} of three main branches: the falconets and true falcons, the caracaras, and the forest falcons.

50|$|Predators of {{the species}} include the <b>laughing</b> <b>falcon</b> (Herpetotheres cachinnans), a bird which specializes in snakes, and Erythrolamprus aesculapii, another species of false coral snake.

50|$|Based on genetic {{research}} from the late 1990s to 2015, Boyd uses three subfamilies. He places the <b>laughing</b> <b>falcon</b> (Herpetotheres) with the forest falcons (Micrastur) into Herpetotherinae (similar to SACC). Caracarinae is separate (similar to NACC), but also contains the spot-winged falconet (Spiziapteryx). The other falcons are placed in Falconinae.|$|E

50|$|Falconinae, in its {{traditional}} classification, contains the falcons, falconets, and pygmy falcons.

50|$|Falcons and {{caracaras}} are carnivores, {{feeding on}} birds, small mammals including bats, reptiles, insects and carrion. In popular imagination the falconids are fast flying predators, {{and while this}} is true of the genus Falco and some falconets, other species, particularly the caracaras, are more sedentary in their feeding. The forest falcons of the Neotropics are generalist forest hunters. Several species, particularly the true falcons, will stash food supplies in caches. They are solitary hunters and pairs guard territories, although they may form large flocks during migration. Some species are specialists, the <b>laughing</b> <b>falcon</b> specialises in snakes, others are more generalist.|$|E

5000|$|A snake-eating {{bird of prey}} {{appears in}} a legend of the Mexican people, who {{gave rise to the}} Aztec empire, and it is {{represented}} in the Mexican flag: The Mexicas, guided by their god Huitzilopochtli, sought a place where the bird landed on a prickly pear cactus, devouring a snake. They found the sign on an island in Lake Texcoco, where they erected the city of Tenochtitlan ("Place of the Prickly Pear Cactus" [...] - [...] present-day Mexico City) in 1325. (In the coat of arms of Mexico this bird is depicted as a golden eagle, though it is often said to be a northern caracara.

50|$|From the Late Postclassic Paris Codex {{back in time}} to the Pre-Classic San Bartolo murals, god D (Itzamna) has the {{so-called}} Principal Bird Deity - perhaps the Yaxcocahmut mentioned above - for a transformative shape (see figure). The bird often holds a bicephalous snake in its beak. Its head sometimes resembles that of a rain deity; at other times, it is more like that of a bird of prey, perhaps the <b>laughing</b> <b>falcon</b> believed to be a harbinger of rain. The wings are repeatedly inscribed with the signs for 'daylight' and 'night', suggesting that the bird's flight could represent the unfolding of time. The San Bartolo murals have a Principal Bird Deity seated on top of each of four world trees, recalling the four world trees (together with a fifth, central tree) which, according to some of the early-colonial Chilam Balam books, were re-erected {{after the collapse of the}} sky. These world trees were associated with specific birds. Four world trees also appear in the Mexican Borgia Codex. The shooting of the Principal Bird deity is one of the main episodes of the Classic Period Hero Twins myth; but strong arguments plead against the Principal Bird Deity's equation with Vucub Caquix, a bird demon shot by the Popol Vuh Twins.|$|E
40|$|Three {{years of}} {{breeding}} season {{data were collected}} on the reproductive behavior and food habits of Laughing Falcons, Herpetotheres cachinnans, in northern Guatemala to describe aspects of foraging and nesting ecology of this little-studied species. Twenty-three nesting attempts were observed at thirteen nest sites. Vocalizations, nest sites and associated hymenoptera were described and growth curves developed from measurements of the young. There was an indication that nesting attempts associated with nidicolous ants increased fledging success, possibly by decreasing ectoparasite (likely Philornis sp.) loads. Foraging and habitat information was gathered through telemetry studies and observations of un-telemetered birds. Laughing Falcons foraged in every available habitat, showing a preferrence for intact forest and arboreal snakes. They utilized a range of forest strata, from 3 ̆c 2 m to emergent canopy trees. It was found that Laughing Falcons were monophagous, eating only snakes in the primary forest of Parque Nacional Tikal and polyphagous outside the borders, where slash-and-burn agricultural practices have modified the landscape. Herpetofauna comprised the majority of <b>Laughing</b> <b>Falcon</b> diets from an observed total of 767 prey items. In mosaic, altered landscapes, Laughing Falcons foraged for snakes, lizards, some small mammals, birds and fish. These birds illustrate a remarkably clear example of an optimally-foraging species, acting as snake specialists in intact rainforest and generalists in human-altered, mosaic habitats. Four pairs of Bat Falcons, Falco rufigularis, were observed in the tropical dry rainforests of Tikal National Park in northern Guatemala to describe feeding ecology and behavior {{of males and females}} in this highly sexually dimorphic aerial predator. Food deliveries were observed to identify the relative abundance and importance of different prey species in the diet of males and females. Prey items were identified to the species level when possible and prey biomass estimates were made. Prey remains were collected daily from one nest. Over 1, 500 observational hours at the four nests identified 197 prey species and very little difference between sexes in prey size or type. Hunting excursions were observed above the canopy at two nests and capture attempts were recorded to reveal no significant differences in success rates between males and females. There were, however, significant differences between nests as to prey types, prey biomass and the female 2 ̆ 7 s contribution to prey deliveries. Novel foraging behavior was observed as Bat Falcons gleaned insects from tree leaves...|$|E
