It {{may be viewed as}} analogous to height: just as a released object will fall through a difference in heights caused by a gravitational field, so a charge will 'fall' across the voltage caused by an electric field. As relief maps show contour lines marking points of equal height, a set of lines marking points of equal potential (known as equipotentials) may be drawn around an electrostatically charged object. The equipotentials cross all <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> at right angles. They must also lie parallel to a conductor's surface, otherwise this would produce a force that will move the charge carriers to even the potential of the surface.|$|E

25|$|Faraday {{explained}} {{electromagnetic induction}} using a concept he called <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>force.</b> However, {{scientists at the}} time widely rejected his theoretical ideas, mainly {{because they were not}} formulated mathematically. An exception was James Clerk Maxwell, who used Faraday's ideas as the basis of his quantitative electromagnetic theory. In Maxwell's model, the time varying aspect of electromagnetic induction is expressed as a differential equation, which Oliver Heaviside referred to as Faraday's law even though it is slightly different from Faraday's original formulation and does not describe motional EMF. Heaviside's version (see Maxwell–Faraday equation below) is the form recognized today in the group of equations known as Maxwell's equations.|$|E
25|$|Faraday's work {{inspired}} James Clerk Maxwell {{to study}} electromagnetic radiation and light. Maxwell discovered that self-propagating electromagnetic waves would travel through space {{at a constant}} speed, which happened to be equal to the previously measured speed of light. From this, Maxwell concluded that light {{was a form of}} electromagnetic radiation: he first stated this result in 1862 in On Physical <b>Lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>Force.</b> In 1873, he published A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, which contained a full mathematical description of the behaviour of electric and magnetic fields, still known as Maxwell's equations. Soon after, Heinrich Hertz confirmed Maxwell's theory experimentally by generating and detecting radio waves in the laboratory, and demonstrating that these waves behaved exactly like visible light, exhibiting properties such as reflection, refraction, diffraction, and interference. Maxwell's theory and Hertz's experiments led directly to the development of modern radio, radar, television, electromagnetic imaging, and wireless communications.|$|E

On obtaining a value that was close to the speed of light as measured by Fizeau, Maxwell concluded that light consists in undulations of the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.|$|E

2500|$|In {{this model}} (from 1944) the {{companion}} went nova with ejected material {{captured by the}} Sun and planets forming from this material. In a version a year later it was a supernova. [...] In 1955 he proposed a similar system to Laplace, and with more mathematical detail in 1960. It differs from Laplace in that a magnetic torque occurs between the disk and the Sun, which comes into effect immediately or else more and more matter would be ejected resulting in a much too massive planetary system, one comparable to the Sun. The torque causes a magnetic coupling and acts to transfer angular momentum from the Sun to the disk. The magnetic field strength {{would have to be}} 1 gauss. The existence of torque depends on magnetic <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> being frozen into the disk (a consequence of a well-known MHD (magnetohydrodynamic) theorem on frozen-in <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>force).</b> As the solar condensation temperature when the disk was ejected could not be much more than 1000 degrees K., a number of refractories must be solid, probably as fine smoke particles, which would grow with condensation and accretion. These particles would be swept out with the disk only if their diameter at the Earth's orbit was less than 1 meter so as the disk moved outward a subsidiary disk consisting of only refractories remains behind where the terrestrial planets would form. The model is in good agreement with the mass and composition of the planets and angular momentum distribution provided the magnetic coupling is an acceptable idea, but not explained are twinning, the low mass of Mars and Mercury, and the planetoid belts. It was Alfvén who formulated the concept of frozen-in magnetic field lines.|$|E

Applying a pulse with specified width and voltages to the spades made the sheet advance to the next anode, where it stayed until the next advance pulse. Count direction was not reversible.
