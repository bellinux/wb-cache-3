Until 2007 Chile experienced over 15 years a huge growth in its salmon aquaculture, becoming the second <b>largest</b> <b>salmon</b> and <b>trout</b> producer after Norway. By 2006 Chile contributed with 38% of the world's salmon volume just behind Norway that produced 39% of it. In 2006 salmon from Chilean aquacultures was the third largest export product in terms of value, representing 3.9% of Chilean exports behind copper and molybdenum.|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>salmon</b> <b>trout</b> farming in Finland provides an interesting {{example of how}} different trade policies can affect on the conditions of a small section of a primary industry in the global market. During the protectionist times in the 1980 s, Finland became the world-leading producer of <b>salmon</b> <b>trout</b> (Oncorhynchus mykiss) (Saarni et al. 2003). During the global expansion of salmon aquaculture production and trade liberation, the Finnish fish farming industry faced fierce international competition. After Finland joined the European Union in 1995, the food industry was deregulated, and imported Norwegian salmon began to displace domestic <b>salmon</b> <b>trout.</b> In 1997, the import of salmon to the EU was restricted by the Salmon Agreement between the EU and Norway. At first, the minimum import price set for Norwegian salmon raised the import prices of <b>salmon</b> <b>trout</b> too, but it ultimately {{proved to be an}} even more serious problem for Finnish producers than that posed by free trade. After the world market price of salmonids dropped sharply in 2001, very inexpensive Norwegian <b>salmon</b> <b>trout</b> flooded the Finnish market, because <b>salmon</b> <b>trout</b> trade was not regulated in the agreement. The circumvention of the agreement led to an anti-dumping duty by the EU Commission in 2004. international trade, minimum price, <b>salmon</b> agreement, <b>salmon</b> <b>trout,</b> trade policy, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy, F 14,...|$|R
40|$|Research PaperThe {{fish market}} in Finland has changed {{dramatically}} since the removal of trade barriers to the importation of fresh salmon in 1993. Imported salmon has rapidly captured markets from domestically produced <b>salmon</b> <b>trout.</b> Another clear trend has been increased concentration at the wholesale and retail level, {{which in turn has}} increased the possibility to exploit market power for those firms with key locations along the value chain. In this paper we use price data and apply co-integration techniques to investigate the relationship between <b>salmon</b> and <b>salmon</b> <b>trout</b> at different points along the fish marketing chain. It can be concluded that <b>salmon</b> and <b>salmon</b> <b>trout</b> are substitutes in the fresh fish market and that the value chains for both fish species are competitive from the producer to wholesaler level. In addition, the role of wholesalers is central in the <b>salmon</b> <b>trout</b> value chain...|$|R
