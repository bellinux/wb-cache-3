40|$|Abstract. Information {{overload}} is {{a well-known}} problem facing biomedical professionals. MEDLINE, the biomedical bibliographic database, adds hundreds of articles daily to the millions already in its collection. This overload is exacerbated {{by the lack of}} relevance-based ranking for search results, as well as disparate levels of search skill and domain experience of professionals using systems designed to search MEDLINE. We propose to address these problems through <b>learning</b> ranking functions <b>from</b> user relevance feedback. We hypothesize that <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> feedback will give performance similar to <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> the entire data set. We hypothesize that, by employing active learning techniques, we can achieve this performance using feedback on a fraction {{of the total number of}} results. We further hypothesize that <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> metadata, specifically the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms associated with MEDLINE citations, will result in better performance than <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> texutal features. We test our hypotheses through simulation, using the OHSUMED data set. Our results show that ranking functions <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> user feedback approach the performance of ranking functions <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> the entire data set using one half of the total data available. Our results also show that <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> MeSH features greatly outperforms <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> textual features. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Learning</b> <b>from</b> {{computer}} models is a promising approach to learning. This study investigated how {{three types of}} <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> {{computer models}} {{can be applied to}} teach high-school students (aged 14 – 17) about the process of glucose–insulin regulation. Two traditional forms of <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> models (i. e. simulating a predefined model and constructing a model) were compared to <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> an erroneous model. In this innovative form of <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> computer models, students are provided with a model that contained errors to be corrected. As such, students do not have to engage in the difficult task of constructing a model. Rather, they are challenged to work with and correct the model in order for the simulation to generate correct output. As predicted, <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> erroneous models enhances learning of domain-specific knowledge better than running a simulation or constructing a model...|$|R

30|$|On {{the basis}} of {{previous}} research results [12, 13, 16, 20], we propose that <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> examples and problems simultaneously might be more effective and efficient than <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> example-problem pairs in the initial learning phase, and note that the strategy does not lose its effectiveness for proficient learners. Our results indicate that <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> examples and problems simultaneously requires a significantly lower cognitive-load investment than does <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> example-problem pairs for novice learners. One possible explanation {{for this is the}} fact that when <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> example-problem pairs, novice learners do not necessarily understand the problem-solving schema they have just studied. When they solve the problems, they must still use search strategies such as mean-ends analysis to deal with the interactive elements they did not fully comprehend, which can impose a high cognitive load. However, students possessing prior skills may be able to reconstruct the problem-solving schema when they study the examples. For them, <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> examples and problems simultaneously may appear similar to <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> example-problem pairs. This explanation does not conflict with previous studies, and it supports our finding that learners with better exercise scores in problem solving obtain better test scores.|$|R
