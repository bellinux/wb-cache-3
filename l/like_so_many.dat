5|$|At {{the end of}} the English Civil War Lady Drake {{was joined}} at her Devon home, Ash House in the parish of Musbury, by her fourth {{daughter}} Elizabeth Drake and her husband Winston Churchill (1620–1688), a Royalist cavalry captain. Unlike his mother-in-law who had supported the Parliamentary cause, Winston had the misfortune of fighting on the losing side of the war – for which he, <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> other Cavaliers, was forced to compound; in his case £446 18s. Although Winston had paid off the fine by 1651, it had impoverished him. From this episode may derive the Churchill family motto: Fiel Pero Desdichado ("Faithful but Unfortunate").|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, it is {{unwise to}} dismiss it {{altogether}} {{as it is}} also the principal Latin source regarding a century of Roman history. For example, scholars had assumed that Veturius Macrinus mentioned in the Life of Didius Julianus was an invention of the author, <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> other names. However, an inscription was uncovered which confirmed his existence and his post as Praetorian Prefect in 193. Likewise, the information that Hadrian's Wall was constructed during Hadrian's reign and that the Antonine Wall was built during the reign of Antoninus Pius are recorded by no other extant ancient writer apart from the Historia Augusta, the veracity of which has been confirmed by inscriptions.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1970s plans {{continued}} to emerge for the redevelopment of the Albert Dock {{site and the}} whole of the south docks system in general. Many of these plans were quite extreme including Liverpool City Council's suggestion to use the dock basin as a landfill site. The Mersey Docks and Harbour Company (MDHC), the reincarnation of the now defunct Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, however felt it could get more money by filling in the dock basin with sand and selling it as developable land and not derelict land. One plan for the Albert Dock that was taken more seriously was the idea that it become the new home of Liverpool Polytechnic (now John Moores University). The government was even willing to provide £3m in funding but <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> other plans this too fell by the wayside.|$|E

Wolfe, after all, is ruder than anyone on Survivor.|$|E

Godfrey also made various guest appearances, and he and Lucille Ball co-hosted the CBS special 50 Years of Television (1978). He also made a cameo appearance in the 1979 B-movie Angels Revenge.|$|E

25|$|The {{economy of}} Hillsboro, <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> other small, rural towns in North Dakota, is heavily {{dependent}} on agriculture.

One of the more obvious effects the agricultural community has had on Hillsboro is found at the American Crystal Sugar sugar beet plant directly north of town.

The BBC gave her her own radio show in 1947 dubbed Our Gracie's Working Party in which 12 towns were visited by Fields, and a live show of music and entertainment was broadcast weekly with Fields compering and performing, and local talents also on the bill. This tour commenced in Rochdale. <b>Like</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> BBC shows at the time this show transferred to Radio Luxembourg in 1950, sponsored by Wisk soap powder.

Elected to the State House in 1888, he served in the 1889/90 session and was chosen to be the Speaker. He ran for Governor in 1896 as the candidate of the Union (Addicks) Republicans and the National Prohibition Party. However, enough votes went to the Regular Republican candidate, John C.

25|$|<b>Like</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> others, Étienne was {{eventually}} {{forced to flee}} Paris because of {{his opposition to the}} fiscal policies of Cardinal Richelieu, leaving his three children in the care of his neighbour Madame Sainctot, a great beauty with an infamous past who kept one of the most glittering and intellectual salons in all France. It was only when Jacqueline performed well in a children's play with Richelieu in attendance that Étienne was pardoned. In time, Étienne was back in good graces with the cardinal and in 1639 had been appointed the king's commissioner of taxes in the city of Rouen—a city whose tax records, thanks to uprisings, were in utter chaos.|$|E
25|$|From the beginning, Żak {{expressed}} his artistic temperament through a sophisticated application of line, referring in his sanguine portraits to works by Leonardo, Botticelli, Holbein and Dürer. In the {{early stage of}} his career, he approached {{the style of the}} Nabis, through the manipulation of flat areas, enclosed within distinct contours and faded, slightly matte colors. For a brief period, he succumbed – <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> of his Parisian colleagues – to the exoticism and folk atmosphere of Brittany. He also borrowed certain motifs from Chinese porcelain and Persian miniatures. He painted views of Parisian back streets and boulevards on the Seine and, sporadically, took up New Testament themes.|$|E

I was uneasy lest Mr. Lockhart should have recognized me for, as I had been a schoolfellow of his elder brother and frequently in the house of his father, Mr. Lockhart of Carnwath, he might very possibly have known me. He was about eighteen years of age and had been four years in the navy.
