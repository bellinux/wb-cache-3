5|$|In neuroscience, {{long-term}} potentiation (LTP) is a persistent strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity. These are patterns of synaptic activity that produce a <b>long-lasting</b> increase in signal transmission between two neurons. The opposite of LTP is long-term depression, which produces a <b>long-lasting</b> decrease in synaptic strength.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to normal-length spines, {{members of the}} subfamily Opuntioideae have relatively short spines, called glochids, that are barbed along their length and easily shed. These enter the skin and are difficult to remove, causing <b>long-lasting</b> irritation.|$|E
5|$|The {{consolidation}} of Byzantine and Lombard dominions had <b>long-lasting</b> consequences for Italy, as {{the region was}} {{from that moment on}} fragmented among multiple rulers until Italian unification in 1861.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} for explanations involving dietary conservatism, in which predators avoid new prey {{because it is}} an unknown quantity; this is a <b>long-lasting</b> effect. Dietary conservatism has been demonstrated experimentally in some species of birds.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Wilson {{served as}} a member of the Gerow Board, which {{examined}} the military educational system and instituted a series of <b>long-lasting</b> reforms. In 1947, he was diagnosed with neurasthenia, and retired with the rank of major general.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 27,000 Boer {{women and}} {{children}} died in British concentration camps, resulting in a <b>long-lasting</b> legacy of bitterness towards the British and claims of genocide of Afrikaners. The British won the war, but anti-British sentiment contributed {{to the rise of}} Afrikaner nationalism and the pro-Afrikaner National Party was the ruling party of South Africa from 1948 until 1994, the apartheid era.|$|E
5|$|Disulfiram (Antabuse) {{prevents}} {{the elimination of}} acetaldehyde, a chemical the body produces when breaking down ethanol. Acetaldehyde itself {{is the cause of}} many hangover symptoms from alcohol use. The overall effect is severe discomfort when alcohol is ingested: an extremely fast-acting and <b>long-lasting</b> uncomfortable hangover. This discourages an alcoholic from drinking in significant amounts while they take the medicine.|$|E
5|$|Episodic {{memory is}} the ability to {{remember}} the details of specific events. This sort of memory can last for a lifetime. Much evidence implicates the hippocampus in playing a crucial role: people with severe damage to the hippocampus sometimes show amnesia, that is, inability to form new <b>long-lasting</b> episodic memories.|$|E
5|$|In AD 515 Eutharic {{answered}} a summons by Theoderic the Great {{and moved to}} the Ostrogothic court at Ravenna in Italy. Here he was given in marriage Amalasuintha, the daughter of the king. It was Theoderic's intention that this union would create a <b>long-lasting</b> dynastic connection between the previously sundered Ostrogoths and Visigoths. Theoderic also named Eutharic his presumptive heir.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the baths {{served as}} {{community}} spaces for gay men. Even now, some men {{choose to go}} to the baths with their friends (even though they may not necessarily have sex with each other). While many men talk to each other at the baths, even forming <b>long-lasting</b> friendships or relationships, many others do not, preferring, for various reasons, anonymity.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln was {{the first}} American {{president}} to be assassinated and his death had a <b>long-lasting</b> emotional impact upon the United States. Over the three weeks after his death, millions of Americans participated in a nationwide public pageant of grief, including a state funeral, and the 1,700-mile (2,700km) westward journey of the funeral train from Washington, through New York, to Springfield, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Most Hippeastrum bulbs are {{tunicate}} (a protective dry {{outer layer}} and fleshy concentric inner scales or leaf bases). The bulbs are generally between 512cm (2"5") {{in diameter and}} produce two to seven <b>long-lasting</b> evergreen or deciduous leaves that are 3090cm (12"36") long and 2.55cm (1"2") wide. The leaves are hysteranthous (develop after flowering), sessile, rarely persistent and subpetiolate.|$|E
5|$|Propagation is by seed or {{cuttings}} of hardened growth {{less than}} a year old. The seed can be collected from the cones and stored; they are best sown in spring or autumn. The stems and flowers are <b>long-lasting</b> if put in water. The flowers, cones and foliage are used in the cut-flower industry.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis is a <b>long-lasting</b> {{autoimmune}} disease characterized by patches of abnormal skin. These skin patches are typically red, itchy, and scaly. Psoriasis varies in severity from small, localized patches to complete body coverage. Injury {{to the skin}} can trigger psoriatic skin changes at that spot, which {{is known as the}} Koebner phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|Similar to OATS, arthroscopic {{articular}} cartilage paste grafting is a surgical procedure offering cost-effective, <b>long-lasting</b> results for stage IV lesions. A bone and cartilage paste derived from crushed plugs of the non-weight-bearing intercondylar notch can achieve pain relief, repair damaged tissue, and restore function.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{powerful}} and <b>long-lasting</b> stories are the foundation stories, also called origin or creation myths such as the Dreamtime myths of the Australian aborigines, the Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh, or the Hawaiian stories of the origin of the world. These too are developed into books, films, music and games in a way that increases their longevity and enhances their entertainment value.|$|E
5|$|The body's {{first line}} of defence against viruses is the innate immune system. This {{comprises}} cells and other mechanisms that defend the host from infection in a non-specific manner. This means that {{the cells of the}} innate system recognise, and respond to, pathogens in a generic way, but, unlike the adaptive immune system, it does not confer <b>long-lasting</b> or protective immunity to the host.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Melbourne, where he earned Master of Arts and Master of Laws degrees, McCay established a successful legal practice, McCay & Thwaites. He {{was a member of}} the Victorian Parliament for Castlemaine from 1895 to 1899, where he was a champion of women's suffrage and federation. He lost his seat in 1899 but became a member of the first Australian Federal Parliament in 1901. He was Minister for Defence from 1904 to 1905, during which he implemented <b>long-lasting</b> reforms, including the creation of the Military Board.|$|E
5|$|Actinium-227 {{is used as}} {{a neutron}} source. Its high {{specific}} energy (14.5 W/g) and the possibility of obtaining significant quantities of thermally stable compounds are attractive for use in <b>long-lasting</b> thermoelectric generators for remote use. 228Ac {{is used as a}}n indicator of radioactivity in chemical research, as it emits high-energy electrons (2.18 MeV) that can be easily detected. 228Ac-228Ra mixtures are widely used as an intense gamma-source in industry and medicine.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, onions may be bred {{and grown}} to mature at smaller sizes. Depending on the mature {{size and the}} purpose for which the onion is used, these may be {{referred}} to as pearl, boiler, or pickler onions, but differ from true pearl onions which are a different species. Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler onions are often preserved in vinegar as a <b>long-lasting</b> relish.|$|E
5|$|After the crash, the North Tower burned for 102minutes before {{collapsing}} at 10:28A.M. Although {{the impact}} itself caused extensive structural damage, the <b>long-lasting</b> fire ignited by jet fuel was {{blamed for the}} structural failure of the tower. In addition to the aircraft passengers and building occupants, hundreds of rescue workers also died when the tower collapsed. Cantor Fitzgerald L.P., an investment bank on floors 101–105 of the World Trade Center One, lost 658employees, considerably {{more than any other}} employer.|$|E
5|$|Armillaria species form fleshy, white-spored {{mushrooms}} with a cottony or membranous veil {{that typically}} forms a distinct annulus on the stem. The fruit bodies usually occur in autumn in large clusters {{at the base}} of the stem or roots. Armillaria species can produce rhizomorphs—rootlike aggregations of hyphae—that can form massive, <b>long-lasting</b> underground networks. The growth of the rhizomorph networks allows for tree-to-tree spread of the fungus even when direct contact between diseased and healthy plants is not possible.|$|E
5|$|As {{with any}} war of such length, the {{drawn-out}} Byzantine–Arab Wars had <b>long-lasting</b> effects {{for both the}} Byzantine Empire and the Arab world. The Byzantines experienced extensive territorial loss, while the invading Arabs gained strong control in the Middle East and Africa. The focus of the Byzantine Empire shifted from the western reconquests of Justinian to a primarily defensive position, against the Islamic armies on its eastern borders. Without Byzantine interference in the emerging Christian states of western Europe, the situation gave a huge stimulus to feudalism and economic self-sufficiency.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence {{is used by}} {{a variety}} of animals to mimic other species. Many species of deep sea fish such as the {{anglerfish}} and dragonfish make use of aggressive mimicry to attract prey. They have an appendage on their heads called an esca that contains bioluminescent bacteria able to produce a <b>long-lasting</b> glow which the fish can control. The glowing esca is dangled or waved about to lure small animals to within striking distance of the fish.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Filao was {{the most}} notable storm of the season, {{originating}} in late February off northern Madagascar. It ultimately struck Mozambique on March1, where it killed about 100people and left $10million in damage (1988USD). In January, both tropical storms Calidera and Doaza crossed Madagascar, the latter of which helped end a drought. <b>Long-lasting</b> Tropical Storm Hely also struck the country in March. The strongest cyclone of the season was Gasitao, which formed {{at the same time}} as Hely and attained peak winds of 150km/h (95mph). The season ended when Tropical Storm Iarisena dissipated northeast of Madagascar in the middle of May.|$|E
5|$|Described as the {{definitive}} deathblow to democracy in Guatemala, the coup was widely criticized internationally, {{and contributed to}} <b>long-lasting</b> anti-U.S. sentiment in Latin America. Attempting to justify the coup, the CIA launched Operation PBHISTORY, which sought evidence of Soviet influence in Guatemala among documents from the Árbenz era: the effort was a failure. Castillo Armas quickly assumed dictatorial powers, banning opposition parties, imprisoning and torturing political opponents, and reversing the social reforms of the revolution. Nearly four decades of civil war followed, as leftist guerrillas fought a series of U.S.-backed authoritarian regimes whose brutalities included a genocide of the Maya peoples.|$|E
5|$|During the English Civil War Manchester {{strongly}} favoured the Parliamentary interest. Although not <b>long-lasting,</b> Cromwell granted it {{the right}} to elect its own MP. Charles Worsley, who sat for the city for only a year, was later appointed Major General for Lancashire, Cheshire and Staffordshire during the Rule of the Major Generals. He was a diligent puritan, turning out ale houses and banning the celebration of Christmas; he died in 1656.|$|E
5|$|Following a raid in 710, a predominately Berber army {{under the}} command of Tariq ibn Ziyad crossed from North Africa in April 711 and landed somewhere in the {{vicinity}} of Gibraltar (though most likely not in the bay or at the Rock itself). Although Tariq's expedition was an outstanding success and led to the Islamic conquest of most of the Iberian peninsula, he ended his career in disgrace after falling out with the Arab general Musa bin Nusayr. His conquest nonetheless left a <b>long-lasting</b> legacy for Gibraltar: Mons Calpe was renamed Jebel Tariq, the Mount of Tariq, subsequently corrupted into Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell {{was awarded}} the first U.S. patent for the telephone. Thomas Edison's {{research}} laboratory, {{one of the first}} of its kind, developed the phonograph, the first <b>long-lasting</b> light bulb, and the first viable movie camera. The latter lead to emergence of the worldwide entertainment industry. In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line. The Wright brothers, in 1903, made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.|$|E
5|$|In May and June 1953, {{an unusually}} <b>long-lasting</b> upper-level low persisted across Mexico and Central America. On May 25, a weak warm-core surface {{circulation}} developed east of Nicaragua. It {{moved around the}} upper-level low, bringing it to the northwest and later looping to the south through Honduras and Central America. The system weakened over land, but it re-intensified over the western Caribbean Sea, moving over western Cuba as a 50mph (80km/h) tropical storm on May 31. Advisories for Alice did not begin until June 1, when the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northern}} areas, the species {{can be found}} in Alaska, Iceland, northern Scandinavia, Greenland and Russia. These are not only particular, specialised species; according to an overview study, more than 150 species were found in the arctic and subarctic regions of Iceland, Greenland, northern Russia and Alaska. These distinctly exceed the tree line. In Greenland, the habitat may reach the 77th latitude line. The Myxogastria species reach their largest biodiversity and highest frequency in forests of temperate regions, which are ideal habitats because of the amount of rich organic material, suitable humidity (not too high) and <b>long-lasting</b> snow cover for snow-inhabiting species.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{in cancer}} {{may arise from}} a tumor {{compressing}} or infiltrating nearby body parts; from treatments and diagnostic procedures; or from skin, nerve and other changes caused by a hormone imbalance or immune response. Most chronic (<b>long-lasting)</b> pain {{is caused by the}} illness and most acute (short-term) pain is caused by treatment or diagnostic procedures. However, radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy may produce painful conditions that persist long after treatment has ended.|$|E
5|$|The Ming court {{appointed}} three Princes of Dharma (法王) {{and five}} Princes (王), and granted many other titles, such as Grand State Tutors (大國師) and State Tutors (國師), to the important schools of Tibetan Buddhism, including the Karma Kagyu, Sakya, and Gelug. According to Wang Jiawei and Nyima Gyaincain, leading officials of these organs were all {{appointed by the}} central government and were subject {{to the rule of}} law. Yet Van Praag describes the distinct and <b>long-lasting</b> Tibetan law code established by the Phagmodru ruler Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen as one of many reforms to revive old Imperial Tibetan traditions.|$|E
5|$|The cane cholla (or {{walking stick}} cholla, tree cholla, chainlink cactus, etc.) (Cylindropuntia imbricata) is a cactus {{found in the}} Southwestern United States and {{northern}} Mexico, including some cooler regions in comparison to many other cacti. It occurs primarily in the arid regions of the Southwestern United States in the states of Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Nevada. It is often conspicuous because of its shrubby or even tree-like size, its silhouette, and its <b>long-lasting</b> yellowish fruits.|$|E
5|$|The {{declaration}} {{had many}} <b>long-lasting</b> consequences. It greatly increased {{popular support for}} Zionism, {{and led to the}} creation of Mandatory Palestine, which later became Israel and the Palestinian territories. As a result it is considered to have caused the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict, often described as the world's most intractable conflict. Controversy remains over a number of areas, such as whether the declaration contradicted earlier promises the British made to the Sharif of Mecca in the McMahon–Hussein correspondence.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippocampus}} contains {{high levels}} of glucocorticoid receptors, which make it more vulnerable to long-term stress than most other brain areas. There is evidence that humans having experienced severe, <b>long-lasting</b> traumatic stress show atrophy of the hippocampus more than of {{other parts of the}} brain. These effects show up in post-traumatic stress disorder, and they may contribute to the hippocampal atrophy reported in schizophrenia and severe depression. A recent study has also revealed atrophy as a result of depression, but this can be stopped with anti-depressants even if they are not effective in relieving other symptoms.|$|E
