5|$|An {{apartment}} on the 16th and 17th floors has been the official residence of the premier of Quebec since 2001. These two floors, the highest habitable ones since the 18th floor is taken up by machinery, had originally been reserved for a CDP executive suite. There had been a previous attempt at offering the premier an official residence. In 1994, the Quebec City Chamber of Commerce had bought a large residence at 1080 rue des Braves and donated it to then premier Jacques Parizeau. There were issues of security and neighbour relationships, however, and Lucien Bouchard declined to use it. He <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> {{apartment on}} Parliament Hill {{for most of his}} mandate.|$|E
5|$|After serving her sentence, she was {{deported}} to Canada, something which left her feeling bitter. There, Max Hyatt, the gothi of the Asatru Alliance-affiliated group Wodan's Kindred, {{invited her to}} live {{at his home in}} Vancouver Island, British Columbia. However, after personal and political differences surfaced, Christensen left Hyatt's home and moved into an RV park in Parksville, Vancouver Island, where she <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> trailer. Despite being far less involved in Odinic activities than she had been previously, she set about trying to revive the Odinist Fellowship. In 1998 she began publication of Midgard Page, which was produced in both paper and electronic copies, the latter of which was housed on Hyatt's Wodansdaeg Press website. During her later years, she became more moderate in her views, encouraging a cultural change among Aryans rather than political actions. This contrasted with the more radical views of newer groups like Wotansvolk, who embraced militant action to bring about socio-political change. She died on May 4, 2005.|$|E

5|$|Paul Mansfield {{hoped the}} birth of their child would {{discourage}} her interest in acting. When it did not, he agreed to move to Los Angeles in late 1954 to help further her career. In 1952, she juggled motherhood and classes at the University of Texas. Early in 1952, Paul was called to the United States Army Reserve for the Korean War. While he served in the army, she spent a year at Camp Gordon, Georgia. Her life became easier with Paul's army allotment. Coming back from the Korean War in 1954, he took a job with a small newspaper in East Los Angeles, California, and <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> apartment in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, with Jayne and her pets— a Great Dane, three cats named Sabina, Romulus, and Ophelia, two chihuahuas, a poodle dyed pink, and a rabbit. While in California, she left Jayne Marie with her maternal grandparents and spent the summer semester at UCLA.|$|E
5|$|The male lead of Rockstar {{is played}} by Ranbir Kapoor, with whom Eros International worked {{previously}} on Anjaana Anjaani. His role of Jordan is loosely based on Imtiaz Ali's Jat friend, who <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> settlement in Pitam Pura. He had seen Kareena Kapoor's performance in his Jab We Met and wanted to cast her in the film. However, the script required some romantic scenes between the leads. As Ranbir and Kareena happened to be cousins, this was touted as a problem. Moreover, the filmmakers {{did not want to}} replace Ranbir with any other actor as the character he portrayed was reportedly suitable only for him. They then made a joint decision to replace Kapoor with Nargis Fakhri, after initially approaching Sonam Kapoor and Diana Penty for the replacement. Voice actor Mona Ghosh Shetty dubbed for Fakhri. The film marked Shammi Kapoor's last appearance in a feature film; he died on 14 August 2011.|$|E
