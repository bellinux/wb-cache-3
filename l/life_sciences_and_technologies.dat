30|$|The term “bioeconomy” {{was first}} used in the short title of the 7 th European Commission’s Framework Programme, Theme 2, “Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, and Biotechnology”, i.e., KBBE or else the “Knowledge-Based Bio-Economy.” The {{expression}} “knowledge-based” is used {{to focus on the}} application and critical role of <b>life</b> <b>sciences</b> <b>and</b> <b>technologies</b> and their effects. Bioeconomy is currently included as one of the key priority areas in the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.

40|$|The third <b>Life</b> <b>Sciences</b> <b>and</b> <b>Technologies</b> for Developing Countries Programme (STD 3), {{funded by}} the European Commission, ran from 1992 to 1995. This {{programme}} encouraged research institutions of industrialised and developing countries to co-operate closely in multidisciplinary projects. In the field of agriculture and the management of natural resources, 157 projects were selected from among the 1, 283 proposals submitted to the Commission. Compared to the first two STD projects (1983 - 1991), the STD 3 projects placed more emphasis on production systems and sustainable management of the environment. Communication {{of the results of}} such programmes tends to be restricted to specialised articles published in scientific journals and conference proceedings, and these often remain inaccessible to non-experts. CTA therefore collaborated with the Commission in order to improve the dissemination of the results among the ACP and EU research and development communities. The Centre published summaries of STD 1 and 2 project reports in a series of volumes that appeared between 1989 and 1996. Details of the participating organisations were included, so as to promote contacts and exchanges between these and researchers on other continents. A new approach has been adopted for STD 3 : the summaries, details of organisations and indexes have been published electronically, to speed up access to selected information. The first 50 reports of the STD 3 projects are now available on-line, in English or French, on the CTA Website, www. cta. nl. They are grouped under six main themes: production systems; restoration and conservation of the environment; improvement of crop production; forests; improvement of animal production; aquaculture and fisheries; and post-harvest technologies. About 100 additional reports will be published in the course of 1999 and 2000.

40|$|The {{development}} of biotechnologies, as the contemporary technological progress in general, not always holds in due consideration {{the interaction between}} Man, Earth, Animals and Plants. It is necessary, in our opinion, to develop, codify and divulge new ethical conceptions exceeding the economic approach between Man and Nature. If the scientist {{does not want to}} reduce his part to that of a simple "technician", he cannot avoid asking questions of social, cultural and ethical nature : each aspect of the sciences (practical or theoretical), in fact, involves the problem of their use by society, of which the researcher is part. A new ethics which faces without dogmatism the problems related to the precarious equilibrium between Man and the other elements of Nature is urgently needed. Today, global bioethics may be able to mediate between opposing ideologies by providing a common ground in health care, earth care and long-term survival: we need a global bioethic that will help the future generations to survive. This book aims at implementing research and education on the ethical problems risen by the ongoing developments in the <b>Life</b> <b>Sciences</b> <b>and</b> <b>Technologies.</b> It is a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary work resulting of fundamental and applied reflection on bioethical problems...|$|E
40|$|Social {{movements}} are important sociological phenomena {{because they are}} the key agents that provide societies with new ideas and ideals to change people's behavior or their understanding of the world. This thesis aims to investigate into how the collective identity of the biohacker in the Do-it-Yourself Biology (DIYbio) movement mobilizes collective action to achieve social change. The collective identity of a movement is the “we” that influences how biohackers give meaning to the collectivity and make sense of their actions and the goals they pursue based on shared beliefs, values, critiques and visions of the world. The biohacker can be understood as the bio subgenre of the hacker, whose ethic and practices of free and open-source software and hackerspaces—or in other words practices of Commons- Based Peer-Production—are adapted to the <b>life</b> <b>sciences</b> <b>and</b> <b>technologies.</b> To research how the collective identity is constructed I analyzed the practices and discourses of the DIYbio movement. I performed participant observation in movement areas where they carry out collective action; an online discussion forum and in a biohackerspace. I also performed documentary analysis of popular media articles and discourse analysis of in-depth interviews with biohackers from around the world. To understand the dynamics of how biohackers mobilize collective action I proposed a framework in which biohackers define problems and solutions based on their communal values of openness, freedom, and collaboration. The DIYbio movement coordinates collective action for social change on a political level as it aims to democratize biology and create a commons of the means of production, and on a cultural level by promoting a work ethic of freedom of inquiry and sharing under a collaborative commons.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the project were to compare different cultivar types and methods {{to establish and maintain}} them in reseeded and permanent pastures as a basis for efficient low cost sheep production. In Ireland only 3 % of pastures are reseeded annually and permanent pastures rarely contain more than 5 % white clover. Improved clover content offers benefits of higher lamb growth rate and reduced fertiliser N use. Comparisons under cutting conditions provided no basis for replacement of Grasslands Huia by the new cultivar Aberherald. Grasslands Huia established successfully following direct reseeding and rotational grazing by sheep. It established more quickly than Kentish and gave higher yield only in the first year. A mixture of small and medium size white clovers should be sown for sheep grazing. Increasing seeding rate from 2 to 4 kg per ha increased pasture clover content only in the first year. Grasslands Huia persisted quite well for up to 5 years under rotational sheep grazing. It also survived under continuous grazing but leaf size was reduced. Rotational grazing management with sheep increased the clover content of permanent pasture from under 2 % to 4 % over 2 years. Highest clover yields were achieved with rest intervals of 20 to 28 days. Simulated mixed sheep and cattle rotational grazing on permanent pasture resulted in intermediate (10 to 12 %) clover dry matter contributions to total dry matter compared with cattle (15 to 18 %) and sheep (5 to 8 %). Lamb growth rate was about 35 % higher when the clover content of the sward was increased from very low to about 35 %.

40|$|Since 1983 the European Community has coordinated its {{research}} and technical development (RTD) activities through annual Framework Programmes. So far, {{there have been}} two Framework Programmes. On 23 April 1990, the Council adopted the Third Framework Programme. This has a duration of 5 years, a budget of 5. 7 billion ECU and contains 15 specific RTD programmes. Amongst them is the programme for 'Life sciences and technologies for developing countries' called STD 3. This programme will be carried out through shared-cost research projects and collaborative research programmes. Its principal objective is to increase cooperation in the fields of tropical agriculture (including fisheries), medicine, health and nutrition between European scientists and scientists from developing countries. This will enable the developing countries to benefit from the scientific knowledge and technological developments available in the Community. It will also help to develop the research capacity of both the developing countries and the Community Member States themselves. The scientific and technical areas covered are the reduction of food shortages, the development of agricultural products with high economic value, the prevention and treatment of the predominant diseases in developing countries, health care systems appropriate to the rural or urban environment of developing countries, and nutrition. The programme is open to all persons and organizations (industrial firms, universities, higher education institutes, research organizations, etc.) established in the Member States of the European Community and in Developing Countries. The closing date for receipt of proposals is 16 December 1991 at 5. 00 pm.
