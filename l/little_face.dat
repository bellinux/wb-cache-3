500|$|... "Summer Love" [...] is an uptempo pop song, with {{a length}} of four minutes and {{thirteen}} seconds. According to digital sheet music published at Musinotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, [...] "Summer Love" [...] {{was written in the}} key of D minor, in common time with a moderately slow 96 beat-per-minute tempo. Timberlake's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of D4 to the high note of A5. Its instrumentation consists of keyboards, drums, guitar, piano and handclaps. [...] Barry Schwartz of Stylus Magazine praised the song and commented that [...] "with its good foot hesitation boom-clap and cascading chorus synthline" [...] 'Summer Love' shows Timberlake's best vocals on FutureSex/LoveSounds." [...] Schwartz further stated that [...] "the beat drops out while he sings in perfect harmony, 'Tell me how they got that pretty <b>little</b> <b>face</b> on that pretty little frame girl'". [...] Lyrically, the single is about [...] "wanting {{to fall in love with}} the lusty seasonal lover".|$|E
2500|$|Pierrot enters {{carrying}} {{newspapers and}} a doll. [...] The newspapers for himself, the doll for his little girl, who is {{sleeping in the}} next room. [...] Having checked on her sleep, he doesn't want to disturb it, so plunges into the reading of his newspapers, which, after filling him with horror, end up by putting him to sleep, too. [...] A dream arrives. [...] Pierrot, now a sleepwalker, gets up, seizes the carafe in which his hallucinated gaze sees some excellent Tokay, and drinks bumper after bumper. [...] A little tipsy, {{he picks up the}} doll, believing it to be his daughter; he rocks it to put it back to sleep, smooths its <b>little</b> <b>face</b> and hair, and, growing annoyed over his exertions in undressing it for bed, he throws it on the floor.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Walter Phillips, who {{was present}} at two of the {{meetings}} in Jinzhou, wrote: [...] "It was at Chinchow that I first {{came into contact with}} the Revival. Meetings had been going on there for a week, hence, I was ushered into the heart of things unprepared, and in candour, I must add, with a strong temperamental prejudice against 'revival hysterics' in every form, so that mine is at least an unbiased witness. At once, on entering the church, one was conscious of something unusual. The place was crowded to the door, and tense, reverent attention sat on every face. The very singing was vibrant with new joy and vigour [...] [...] [...] The people knelt for prayer, silent at first, but soon one here and another there began to pray aloud. The voices grew and gathered volume and blended into a great wave of united supplication that swelled till it was almost a roar, and died down again into an undertone of weeping. Now I understood why the floor was so wet - [...] it was wet with pools of tears! The very air seemed electric -- I speak in all seriousness [...] - and strange thrills coursed up and down one's body. Then above the sobbing, in strained, choking tones, a man began to make public confession. Words of mine will fail to describe the awe and terror and pity of these confessions. It was not so much the enormity of the sins disclosed, or the depths of iniquity sounded, that shocked one[...] [...] [...] It was the agony of the penitent, his groans and cries, and voice shaken with sobs; it was the sight of men forced to their feet, and, in spite of their struggles, impelled, as it seemed, to lay bare their hearts that moved one and brought the smarting tears to one's own eyes. Never have I experienced anything more heart breaking, more nerve racking than the spectacle of those souls stripped naked before their fellows. So for hour after hour it went on, till the strain was almost more than the onlooker could bear. Now it was a big, strong farmer groveling on the floor, smiting his head on the bare boards as he wailed unceasingly, 'Lord! Lord!' Now a shrinking woman in a voice scarce above a whisper, now a wee laddie from the school, with the tears streaking his piteous grimy <b>little</b> <b>face,</b> as he sobbed out: 'I cannot love my enemies. Last week I stole a farthing from my teacher. I am always fighting and cursing. I beseech the pastor, elders and deacons to pray for me.' And then again would swell that wonderful deep organ tone of united prayer. And ever as the prayer sank again the ear caught a dull undertone of quiet sobbing, of desperate entreaty from men and women, who, lost to their surroundings, were wrestling for peace." ...|$|E

6000|$|These sly <b>little</b> <b>faces</b> peeped out of {{the grand}} tide of the cathedral like {{something}} that knew better.

60|$|Apart {{from the}} lift and spring {{of the great}} impulse towards the altar, these <b>little</b> <b>faces</b> had {{separate}} wills, separate motions, separate knowledge, which rippled back {{in defiance of the}} tide, and laughed in triumph of their own very littleness.|$|R

60|$|And {{it was as}} if {{she must}} grasp at something, as if her wings were too weak to lift her {{straight}} off the heaving motion. So she caught sight of the wicked, odd <b>little</b> <b>faces</b> carved in stone, and she stood before them arrested.|$|R
