50|$|Drone brood in worker cellsAnother good {{indicator}} is {{drone brood}} in worker sized cells. Drones are raised in larger cells than workers. Drone cells are recognizable by their larger size; and when capped, drone cells are capped with blunt pointed cappings. Drones in worker cells are {{a sure sign}} of a failing queen or <b>laying</b> <b>worker.</b>|$|E
50|$|Egg {{position}}Egg {{position in}} the cell is a good indicator of a <b>laying</b> <b>worker.</b> A queen bee's abdomen is noticeably longer than a worker, allowing a queen to lay an egg {{at the bottom of}} the cell. A queen bee will usually lay an egg centered in the cell. Workers cannot reach the bottom of normal depth cells, and will lay eggs on the sides of the cell or off center.|$|E
50|$|Number of eggs per cell The {{beekeeper}} {{looks at}} the honeycomb cells {{to see how many}} eggs are laid in each one. Queen bees will usually lay only a single egg to a cell, but laying workers will lay multiple eggs per cell. Multiple eggs per cell are not an absolute sign of a <b>laying</b> <b>worker</b> because when a newly mated queen begins laying, she may lay more than one egg per cell.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Haplodiploidy {{results in}} {{relatedness}} asymmetries be-tween colony members of highly eusocial Hymenoptera. As a conse-quence, queen and reproductive workers are more {{related to their}} own sons than to each other’s male offspring. Kin selection theory predicts multiple optima in male parentage: either the queen or the workers should produce all the males. Nevertheless, shared male parentage is common in highly eusocial hymenopterans. An inclusive fitness model was {{used to analyze the}} effect of the number of reproductive workers on male parentage shared by the queen and <b>laying</b> <b>workers</b> by isolat-ing the male component from an inclusive fitness equation using the equal fitness through male condition for each pairwise combination of the three female classes comprised of the queen, <b>laying</b> <b>workers</b> and non-laying workers.

40|$|In dequeened {{honeybee}} colonies ovarian activation {{occurs in}} some workers, and the pheromonal bouquets of these <b>laying</b> <b>workers</b> become more queen-like. In the Asiatic honeybee, Apis cerana, {{we compared the}} amounts of 9 -keto- 2 (E) -decenoic acid (9 -ODA), a mandibular gland pheromone component, between non-laying workers from queenright colonies and <b>laying</b> <b>workers</b> from queenless colonies and, further, applied synthetic 9 -ODA to workers to determine whether workers discriminate workers with activated ovaries based {{on the level of}} this compound. Levels of 9 -ODA were higher in <b>laying</b> <b>workers</b> from dequeened colonies than in non-laying workers from queenright colonies. In both queenright and queenless colonies, more workers treated with 9 -ODA were attacked by other workers than were control-treated workers. These results suggest that detection of pseudoqueens in A. cerana is mediated by changes in 9 -ODA.

40|$|The size (e. g. length, {{width and}} volume) {{and the weight}} of eggs laid by A. mellifera caucasica queens (Qs) and <b>laying</b> <b>workers</b> (LWs) in both worker cells (WC) and in drone cells (DC) were compared. All {{measurements}} were taken at 3 different embryonic developmental periods (at 0 – 6 h, 18 – 24 h and 54 – 60 h after oviposition). The results showed that the size and weight of fertilized (in WC) and unfertilized (in DC) eggs laid by queens did not differ significantly. However, eggs from <b>laying</b> <b>workers</b> were 2. 8 % longer and 10. 7 % wider, they had as much as 22. 2 % larger volume and they were 22. 3 % heavier compared to eggs laid by queens. Thus, eggs from A. m. caucasica <b>laying</b> <b>workers</b> were larger and heavier than from queens. Significant decrease of size and weight occurred during embryonic development. Shortly before hatching, eggs from queens and workers lost 5. 4 % and 6. 4 % of their length, 8. 9 % and 9. 1 % of their width, 16. 4 % and 16. 9 % of their volume and 28. 1 % and 24. 2 % of their weight, respectively. Eggs laid by queens lost 3. 9 % more weight than eggs laid by workers, and shortly before hatching their density (ratio of weight/volume) was 86. 3 % of the initial in eggs from queens and 91. 7 % in eggs from <b>laying</b> <b>workers.</b> The decrease of the density indicates that the ratio of the lighter fat must have increased in relationship to the other egg components. The larger eggs from <b>laying</b> <b>workers</b> in comparison to eggs from queens {{may be the result of}} lower number of ovarioles in workers (2 – 12) than in queens (160 – 180) ...|$|R
50|$|In {{most common}} bee species, worker bees are {{infertile}} due to enforced altruistic kin selection, and thus never reproduce. Workers are nevertheless considered female for anatomical and genetic reasons. Genetically, a worker bee does {{not differ from}} a queen bee and can even become a <b>laying</b> <b>worker</b> bee, but in most species will produce only male (drone) offspring. Whether a larva becomes a worker or a queen depends {{on the kind of}} food it is given after the first three days of its larval form.|$|E
50|$|Laying workers {{develop in}} the absence of open brood as {{produced}} by a healthy adult queen. Normally, pheromones from the brood - known as brood recognition pheromones - prevent development of the workers' ovaries. Laying workers can develop after the colony's queen has been lost to swarming, or {{in the presence of a}} failing queen which has yet to be superseded. The process of developing a <b>laying</b> <b>worker</b> usually takes weeks after the loss of the original queen. In adult laying workers there is an anatomic (and physiological) trade-off between the sizes of their more developed ovaries and their less developed food glands.|$|E

In addition, as the number of <b>laying</b> <b>workers</b> increases, the share of male parentage converges to that of non-laying workers. The diminishing return effect on male parentage share depending on the number of reproductive workers leads us to expect the number of reproductive workers to be relatively small in a stingless bee colony, {{even in the absence of}} productivity costs. The available data confirms this hypothesis, as there is an unusually small number of reproductive workers in stingless bee colonies. FAPESP/BIOTA[04 / 15801 - 0...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{consequences}} of massive investment in antiretroviral access and other AIDS programmes has been the rapid emergence of large numbers of <b>lay</b> <b>workers</b> in the health systems of developing countries. In South Africa, government estimates are 65, 000, mostly HIV/TB care-related <b>lay</b> <b>workers</b> contribute their labour in the public health sector, outnumbering the main front-line primary health care providers and professional nurses. The phenomenon has grown organically and incrementally, playing a wide variety of care-giving, support and advocacy roles. Using South Africa as a case, this paper discusses the different forms, traditions and contradictory orientations taken by lay health work and the system-wide effects of a large <b>lay</b> <b>worker</b> presence. As pressures to regularise and formalise the status of <b>lay</b> health <b>workers</b> grow, important questions are raised as to their place in health systems, and more broadly what they represent as a new intermediary layer between state and citizen. It argues for a research agenda that seeks to better characterise types of lay involvement in the health system, particularly in an era of antiretroviral therapy, and which takes a wider perspective on the meanings of this recent re-emergence of an old concept in health systems heavily affected by HIV/AIDS.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} lay {{interpretations of}} <b>lay</b> health <b>worker</b> roles within three UK community-based health promotion projects. It argues that understanding <b>lay</b> health <b>worker</b> roles requires {{critical analysis of}} the complex interrelationships between professionals, <b>lay</b> <b>workers</b> and the communities receiving a programme. Findings are presented that are drawn from a qualitative study of lay engagement in public health programme delivery where a key objective {{was to examine the}} perspectives of community members with the experience of receiving services delivered by <b>lay</b> health <b>workers.</b> Interviews and focus groups were conducted with 46 programme recipients from three case study projects; a breastfeeding peer support service, a walking for health scheme and a neighbourhood health project. The results show how participants interpreted the function and responsibilities of <b>lay</b> health <b>workers</b> and how those roles provided personalized support and facilitated engagement in group activities. Further insights into community participation processes are provided revealing the potential for active engagement in both formal and informal roles. The paper concludes that social relationships are core to understanding <b>lay</b> health <b>worker</b> programmes and therefore analysis needs to take account of the capacity for community members to move within a spectrum of participation defined by increasing responsibility for others...|$|R
5000|$|In honeybees, the drones (males) {{are entirely}} {{derived from the}} queen, their mother. The diploid queen has 32 {{chromosomes}} and the haploid drones have 16 chromosomes. Drones produce sperm cells that contain their entire genome, so the sperm are all genetically identical except for mutations. The male bees' genetic makeup is therefore entirely derived from the mother, while the genetic makeup of the female worker bees is half derived from the mother, and half from the father. Thus, if a queen bee mates with only one drone, any two of her daughters will share, on average, [...] of their genes. The diploid queen's genome is recombined for her daughters, but the haploid father's genome is inherited by his daughters [...] "as is". It is also possible for a <b>laying</b> <b>worker</b> bee to lay an unfertilised egg, which is always a male.|$|E
50|$|Social insects above mentioned, {{excluding}} termites, are haplodiploid. Queen {{and workers}} are diploid, but males develop from haploid genotypes. In some species, suppression of ovary development is not totally {{achieved in the}} worker caste, which opens the possibility of reproduction by workers. Since nuptial flights are seasonal and workers are wingless, workers are almost always virgin, and (as gamergate ants or <b>laying</b> <b>worker</b> bees) can only lay unfertilised eggs. These eggs are in general viable, developing into males. A worker that perform reproduction is considered a 'cheater' within the colony, because its success in leaving descendants becomes disproportionally larger, compared to its sisters and mother. The advantage of remaining functionally sterile is only accomplished if every worker assume this 'compromise'. When one or more workers start reproducing, the 'social contract' is destroyed and the colony cohesion is dissolved. Aggressive behavior derived from this conflict may result {{in the formation of}} hierarchies, and attempts of reproduction by workers are actively suppressed. In some wasps, such as Polistes fuscatus, instead of not laying eggs, the female workers begin being able to reproduce, but once being under the presence of dominant females, the subordinate female workers can no longer reproduce.|$|E

All A. m. capensis laying workers were thelytokous and all A. m. scutellata arrhenotokous. 42. 1 % of the hybrid colonies produced only female offspring while none produced only male offspring. This shows a significant advantage for thelytokous laying workers to become reproductively dominant in hybrid colonies. A. m. capensis colonies built only worker cells and A. m. scutellata only drone cells. Hybrid colonies produced either both cell types or only worker cells according to the mode of <b>laying</b> <b>worker</b> reproduction. In all colonies where laying workers produced male offspring drone cell building was found. Our data strongly indicates that the mode of worker reproduction holds important consequences for cell construction and reproductive dominance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} that interventions for depression and other common mental disorders (CMD) {{can be integrated}} sustainably into primary health care in Africa. We aimed to pilot a low-cost multi-component 'Friendship Bench Intervention' for CMD, locally adapted from problem-solving therapy and delivered by trained and supervised female <b>lay</b> <b>workers</b> to learn if was feasible and possibly effective {{as well as how}} best to implement it on a larger scale. Method We trained <b>lay</b> <b>workers</b> for 8 days in screening and monitoring CMD and in delivering the intervention. Ten <b>lay</b> <b>workers</b> screened consecutive adult attenders who either were referred or self-referred to the Friendship Bench between July and December 2007. Those scoring above the validated cut-point of the Shona Symptom Questionnaire (SSQ) for CMD were potentially eligible. Exclusions were suicide risk or very severe depression. All others were offered 6 sessions of problem-solving therapy (PST) enhanced with a component of activity scheduling. Weekly nurse-led group supervision and monthly supervision from a mental health specialist were provided. Data on SSQ scores at 6 weeks after entering the study were collected by an independent research nurse. <b>Lay</b> <b>workers</b> completed a brief evaluation on their experiences of delivering the intervention. Results Of 395 potentially eligible, 33 (8 %) were excluded due to high risk. Of the 362 left, 2 % (7) declined and 10 % (35) were lost to follow-up leaving an 88 % response rate (n = 320). Over half (n = 166, 52 %) had presented with an HIV-related problem. Mean SSQ score fell from 11. 3 (sd 1. 4) before treatment to 6. 5 (sd 2. 4) after 3 - 6 sessions. The drop in SSQ scores was proportional to the number of sessions attended. Nine of the ten <b>lay</b> <b>workers</b> rated themselves as very able to deliver the PST intervention. Conclusion We have found preliminary evidence of a clinically meaningful improvement in CMD associated with locally adapted problem-solving therapy delivered by <b>lay</b> health <b>workers</b> through routine primary health care in an African setting.
