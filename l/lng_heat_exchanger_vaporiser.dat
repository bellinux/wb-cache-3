40|$|Process {{debottlenecking}} {{is one of}} {{a process}} improvement and particularly important when the current conditions of a plant reaches maximum production rate without satisfying market demands. In the case of liquefied natural gas (LNG), transcontinental demands always show steady increment. Since LNG is a source of clean energy and a feedstock to chemical productions, process debottlenecking of existing LNG plants offers economic benefits. In this research, the first objective was to perform process debottlenecking of a published flow sheet of a small scale LNG plant by using Aspen HYSYS. “Bottlenecks” or unit operations which reach bottlenecked conditions were identified by increasing the inlet flow rate. Simulation results showed that, <b>LNG</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> 2 was the single bottlenecked unit operations identified due to the occurrence of temperature cross. The bottlenecks removal was then performed by transferring duty of this active bottleneck to an additional cooler installed. Five different modifications were designed which installation of a cooler at different stream in the flow sheet and applied. Modification 5 showed the highest percentage of LNG production with 5298. 68 % increment from the existing plant. Production revenue for this modification is RM 2552098. 60 after takes into consideration the highest cost of its additional cooling duty which is RM 400000. 00.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to model a single mixed refrigerant process for offshore natural gas liquefaction using ASPEN HYSYS as a simulation tools. The liquefaction process employed in this part {{is a result of}} modification of previous case done by C. W. Remeljeja and A. F. A. Hoadley (2004). This work is divided into two sections. First is to model the PRICO LNG process that published result. Second is to improve the model by adding the mixer in the mixed refrigerant stream after the separator. It allows two different phase of gas and liquid of mixed refrigerant to mix together before entering the <b>LNG</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>Exchanger</b> (cold box). The mixer also helps to maintain a constant flow rate of the stream to the cold box. The results are obtained after the system is converged. When modeling the PRICO process in Aspen Hysys,certain variables such as temperature and pressure at the streams entering and leaving the cold box cannot be changed directly. This will cause temperature cross and change of mixed refrigerant phase in the respected stream. As a result,by doing structural modification on the basic PRICO process specifically in case 3,the load duty of the compressor can be lowered significantly. After three different structural modifications discussed in this paper, the compressor duty to liquefy the natural gas can be reduced down to 82300. 46 kW when compared to the base case. As a conclusion,structural modification in case 3 is the best model when compare case 1 and case 2 because it operates in lowest compressor duty. For the future improvement,a different structure modification can be done using case 3 as a base model,for example replacing the valve with a multiphase expander to generate electricity in this LNG liquefaction process...|$|R
40|$|In {{fuel cell}} technology, certain {{components}} are used {{that are responsible}} for guiding liquid media. When these components are produced by conventional manufacturing, there are often sealing issues, and trouble- and maintenance-free deployment cannot be ensured. Against this background, a new process combination has been developed in a joint project between the University of Duisburg-Essen, the Center for Fuel Cell Technology (ZBT), and the company Galvano-T electroplating forming GmbH. The approach is to combine multi-jet modelling (MJM), electroforming and milling in order to produce a defined external geometry. The wax models are generated on copper base plates and copper-coated to a desirable thickness. Following this, the undefined electroplated surfaces are machined to achieve the desired measurement, and the wax is melted out. This paper presents, first, how this process is technically feasible, then describes how the MJM on a 3 -D Systems ThermoJet was adapted to stabilise the process. In the AiF-sponsored ZIM project, existing limits and possibilities are shown and different approaches of electroplating are investigated. This paper explores whether or not activation of the wax structure by a conductive initial layer is required. Using the described process chain, different parts were built: a <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger,</b> a <b>vaporiser,</b> and a reformer (in which pellets were integrated in an intermediate step).

40|$|This {{cooperative}} research project validates use of man made salt caverns to receive and store the cargoes of LNG ships {{in lieu of}} large liquid LNG tanks. Salt caverns will not tolerate direct injection of LNG {{because it is a}} cryogenic liquid, too cold for contact with salt. This research confirmed the technical processes and the economic benefits of pressuring the LNG up to dense phase, warming it to salt compatible temperatures and then directly injecting the dense phase gas into salt caverns for storage. The use of salt caverns to store natural gas sourced from LNG imports, particularly when located offshore, provides a highly secure, large scale and lower cost import facility as an alternative to tank based LNG import terminals. This design can unload a ship in the same time as unloading at a tank based terminal. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve uses man made salt caverns to securely store large quantities of crude oil. Similarly, this project describes a novel application of salt cavern gas storage technologies used {{for the first time in}} conjunction with LNG receiving. The energy industry uses man made salt caverns to store an array of gases and liquids but has never used man made salt caverns directly in the importation of LNG. This project has adapted and expanded the field of salt cavern storage technology and combined it with novel equipment and processes to accommodate LNG importation. The salt cavern based LNG receiving terminal described in the project can be located onshore or offshore, but the focus of the design and cost estimates has been on an offshore location, away from congested channels and ports. The salt cavern based terminal can provide large volumes of gas storage, high deliverability from storage, and is simplified in operation compared to tank based LNG terminals. Phase I of this project included mathematical modeling that proved a salt cavern based receiving terminal could be built at lower capital cost, and would have significantly higher delivery capacity, shorter construction time, and be much more secure than a conventional liquid tank based terminal. Operating costs of a salt cavern terminal are lower than tank based terminals because ''boil off'' is eliminated and maintenance costs of caverns are lower than LNG tanks. Phase II included the development of offshore mooring designs, wave tank tests, high pressure LNG pump field tests, <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> field tests, and development of a model offshore LNG facility and cavern design. Engineers designed a model facility, prepared equipment lists, and confirmed capital and operating costs. In addition, vendors quoted fabrication and installation costs, confirming that an offshore salt cavern based LNG terminal would have lower capital and operating costs than a similarly sized offshore tank based terminal. Salt cavern storage is infinitely more secure than surface storage tanks, far less susceptible to accidents or purposeful damage, and much more acceptable to the community. More than thirty industry participants provided cost sharing, technical expertise, and guidance in the conduct and evaluation of the field tests, facility design and operating and cost estimates. Their close participation has accelerated the industry's acceptance of the conclusions of this research. The industry participants also developed and submitted several alternative designs for offshore mooring and for high pressure <b>LNG</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> in addition to those that were field tested in this project. HNG Storage, a developer, owner, and operator of natural gas storage facilities, and a participant in the DOE research has announced they will lead the development of the first offshore salt cavern based LNG import facility. Which will be called the Freedom LNG Terminal. It will be located offshore Louisiana, and is expected to be jointly developed with other members of the research group yet to be named. An offshore port license application is scheduled to be filed by fourth quarter 2005 and the terminal could be operational by 2009. This terminal allows the large volume importation of LNG without disrupting coastal port operations by being offshore, out of sight of land...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} indeterminates in the design as well as {{operation}} of <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> is the rate of fouling a select <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> geometry would exhibit over the operation cycles. Gradual deterioration of <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> performance due to the accumulation of fouling film on the heat transfer surface is often accounted for {{in the form of}} a fouling resistance, or commonly known as the fouling factor, while determining the heat transfer surface required for a specific heat duty.

It is shown that the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> with the H-shape baffle support structure combines the respective characteristics of <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> with cross fluid flow and longitudinal fluid flow in shell-sides, and integrates advantages of both <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers.</b> On some operating conditions, the new <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> with the H-shape baffle support structure has wide application prospect...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} several <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> designs were constructed, tested, {{and the effect}} of the design on the overall {{efficiency}} and power generated by thermoelectric generators was measured. The thermoelectric elements were attached to the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> and hot gas passed through the system simulating automotive exhaust. An aluminum duct <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger,</b> a copper <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger,</b> and a <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> with a twisted tape insertion were tested. The <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> were all rectangular with similar dimensions and minimum thicknesses near the wall. The flow of exhaust gas was created by heated air flow ranging from 100 - 150 LPM. The cool side <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> was setup to simulate a coolant pump using ethylene glycol water mixture (automobile coolant). For measurements, all the thermocouples and thermoelectric generators were connected through the data acquisition program LabView. For the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> designs the availability, cost effectiveness, implementation probability, and overall performance based on literature was considered. It was observed that due to the insertion of the tape, heat enhancement occurred. It was determined that the tape inside the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> reduced the diameter of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> which increased the velocity inside of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> thus increasing the overall heat transfer coefficient. This is confirmed by the overall increase in <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> efficiency of nearly 48 % and output power generation of 31 % when compared...|$|R
