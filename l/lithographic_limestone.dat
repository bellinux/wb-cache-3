5|$|The larger French {{specimen}} (MNHN CNJ 79) {{was discovered}} by quarry owner Louis Ghirardi around 1971 in the Portlandian <b>lithographic</b> <b>limestone</b> of Canjuers near Nice in southeastern France. It dates to the lower Tithonian. Although Alain Bidar originally described the specimen as a separate species called Compsognathus corallestris, Ostrom, Jean-Guy Michard and others have since relabeled it as another example of Compsognathus longipes. Quimby identified the smaller German specimen as a juvenile of the same species. In 1983, the National Museum of Natural History in Paris acquired the French Compsognathus fossil; Michard thoroughly studied it there.|$|E

500|$|Compsognathus {{is known}} from two almost {{complete}} skeletons, one from Germany that is [...] long and another from France that is [...] long. The physician and fossil collector Joseph Oberndorfer acquired the German specimen (BSP AS I 563) in 1859, discovered {{about the same}} year in the <b>lithographic</b> <b>limestone</b> deposits in the Riedenburg-Kelheim region of Bavaria, in the Jurassic part of a lagoonal region known as the Solnhofen archipelago. The limestone of this area has also yielded such well-preserved fossils as Archaeopteryx with feather impressions and some pterosaurs with imprints of their wing membranes. The German Compsognathus fossil itself most likely came from the Painten Formation of the Kapfelberg locality, specifically dated to the uppermost Kimmeridgian stage (150.8 million years ago); however, alternative possibilities include quarries near Jachenhausen or Goldberg, both from the Tithonian, to which stage Compsognathus has traditionally been dated. Johann A. Wagner discussed the specimen briefly in 1859, when he coined the name Compsognathus longipes, and described it in detail in 1861. In early 1868, Thomas Huxley compared the two species and, following earlier suggestions by Karl Gegenbaur and Edward Drinker Cope, concluded that, apart from its arms and feathers, the Archaeopteryx skeleton was closely similar to Compsognathus, and that the proto-bird {{was related to the}} dinosaurs. In 1896, Othniel Marsh recognized the fossil as a true member of the Dinosauria. John Ostrom thoroughly redescribed the species in 1978, {{making it one of the}} best-known small theropods at that time. The German specimen is on display at the Bayerische Staatsammlung für Paläontologie und historische Geologie (Bavarian State Institute for Paleontology and Historical Geology) in Munich, Germany, which bought the fossil from Oberndorfer in 1865.|$|E

40|$|Larvae of malacostracan {{crustaceans}} {{represent a}} large fraction of modern day zooplankton. Plankton {{is not only}} {{a major part of the}} modern marine ecosystem, but must have played an important role in the ecosystems of the past as well. Unfortunately, our knowledge about plankton composition of the past is still quite limited. As an important part of today’s zooplankton, malacostracan larvae are still a rarity in the fossil record; many types of malacostracan larvae dominating the modern plankton have so far not been found as fossils. Here we report a new type of fossil malacostracan larva, found in the 150 million years old <b>lithographic</b> <b>limestones</b> of southern Germany (Solnhofen <b>Lithographic</b> <b>Limestones).</b> The three rather incomplete specimens mainly preserve the telson. A pronounced middle spine on the posterior edge of these specimens indicates that they are either larval forms of a clawed lobster or of an axiidean lobster, or of a closer relative to one of the two groups. The tergo-pleura are drawn out into distinct spines in one specimen, further supporting the interpretation as a larva of a clawed lobster or an early relative. The telson morphology also shows adaptations to a prolonged planktic life style, the latero-posterior edges are drawn out into distinct spines. Similar adaptations are known in larvae of the modern homarid lobster Nephrops norvegicus, not necessarily indicating a closer relationship, but convergent life styles. The new finds provide an important new insight into the composition of Mesozoic zooplankton and demonstrate the preservation potential of <b>lithographic</b> <b>limestones...</b>|$|R
40|$|We present {{different}} documentation methods {{tested on}} fossil specimens from Solnhofen-type <b>lithographic</b> <b>limestones</b> (Upper Jurassic, southern Germany) {{and from the}} related deposits from the Upper Cretaceous of Lebanon. One of the principles is composite imaging. This combines image fusion, i. e., coalescing several images of the same area but at different focal planes, resulting in a single image of high depth of field, and image stitching, i. e., combining fused images of several areas to a high reso-lution image of the complete specimen. The basis for the composite images can be normal light images, but most fossils from Solnhofen-type <b>lithographic</b> <b>limestones</b> are autofluorescent under UV light such that UV-fluorescence images can be equally well applied. In this context, we report a new fluorescence type for specimens not showing good UV fluorescence, i. e., those from the Zandt lagerstätte or some from Lebanon. These specimens fluoresce orange when exposed to green light. Specimens from Leb-anon exhibiting green-orange fluorescence have been documented under a confocal laser scanning microscope (cLSM).

40|$|International audienceA well-preserved large limulid {{trackway}} {{related to}} Kouphichnium lithographicum is described from the Upper Kimmeridgian <b>Lithographic</b> <b>Limestones</b> of Cerin (Ain, France). It is three meters long and exhibits ten successive sets of imprints {{characterized by a}} pair of well-preserved tetradactyl external imprints of legs VI (named pushers) and a variable number (mostly three pairs) of straight thin intermediate imprints (legs III-V). The trackway is unusually wide and was probably made by a very large adult approximately 38 cm wide and 80 cm long when related to the proportions of the modern Limulus polyphemus. The straightness of the trackway, the great repeat distance (stride), the length of series of leg imprints, their slight angle to the mid-line, the well-marked pusher (= leg VI) imprints and the absence of groove made by the telson all indicate fast progression of a vigorous animal on the sea-floor. This walking trackway can be easily differentiated from other limulid crawling, ploughing, and dying trackways usually found in <b>lithographic</b> <b>limestones</b> or other deposits of the geological record. Main characteristics of these different limulid trackways are evidenced. The occurrence of a living adult in the Cerin restricted lagoon is probably related to a brief period of connection with the open sea. This occurrence indicates either a passive introduction of the animal into the lagoon or a spawning behaviour...|$|R

2500|$|Lithography {{originally}} used {{an image}} drawn with oil, fat, or wax {{onto the surface}} of a smooth, level <b>lithographic</b> <b>limestone</b> plate. The stone was treated with a mixture of acid and gum arabic, [...] "etching" [...] the grease content of the drawing material into the pores of the stone and chemically creating grease reservoirs. The open stone (without drawing) was affected by the gum arabic creating a thin gum layer that would then attract water. When the stone was subsequently moistened, these gummed areas retained water; an oil-based ink could then be applied with a roller sticking only to the original drawing. The ink would finally be transferred to a cotton fine art paper sheet, producing a printed page. This traditional technique is still used as a fine art medium today.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAbundant well-preserved {{jellyfish}} impressions {{are described}} from the Cerin Lagerstätte (Ain, eastern France). The enclosing sediments are <b>lithographic</b> <b>limestones</b> deposited in a Late Kimmeridgian lagoon lying on an emergent reef complex. Two new taxa of Scyphozoa are proposed: Paraurelia cerinensis gen. et sp. nov. (abundant) and Paraurelia sp. A (rare), and two new taxa of Cubozoa: Bipedalia cerinensis gen. et sp. nov. (rare) and Paracarybdea lithographica gen. et sp. nov. (very rare). Rapid covering by a microbial mat helped {{the preservation of}} the animals. Many specimens of Paraurelia cerinensis are deformed by slippage down the palaeoslope, which characterizes the margin of the lagoon. Their resultant morphology and their orientation clearly indicate the downslope direction. Tentacles of Bipedalia cerinensis and Paracarybdea lithographica are also orientated according to the palaeoslope. The jellyfish were probably dead individuals occasionally introduced into the Cerin lagoon. However, another hypothesis may be considered with reference to the model of the present-day jellyfish lakes in Palau (Caroline Islands, Western Pacific). Jellyfish could have lived in the more oxygenated upper layer of water of the Cerin lagoon that allowed pelagic life. This situation could have corresponded to short periods of easier communication between the open sea and the lagoon. Jellyfish are only found in the lower beds of the <b>lithographic</b> <b>limestones</b> and their distribution illustrates the supposed evolution of the Cerin lagoon. Initially, it was deep, mainly flooded, with possibly autochthonous jellyfish and allochthonous animals indicating clear marine influence. Later, the lagoon shallowed and its sediments often emerged with marginal marine burrows and plants indicating increasing terrestrial influence...|$|R
