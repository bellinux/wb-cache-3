5|$|After being {{disgusted with}} the state of the Square and {{learning}} that a councillor has stood down, Peggy and Pat both decide to run for council and are interviewed by journalist Harvey Freeman (Martin Jarvis). Eventually they both pull out of the election, but Harvey hears of this and individually invites them both out. They both finally discover his two-timing, and humiliate him in punishment. When Phil prevents his daughter Louise (Brittany Papple) from contacting her mother Lisa (Lucy Benjamin), Peggy interjects and Phil punches her. Believing he is an unfit parent, Peggy takes Louise to Lisa against Phil's wishes. Although, Lisa promises to allow Phil visitation, she flees with Louise. Phil blames Peggy for the loss of his child and begins using alcohol and crack cocaine. Peggy tries to stop Phil using crack by locking him in her pub, but Phil escapes and in a drunken bid for revenge, he sets fire to Peggy's pub. Peggy watches in horror as it is destroyed. Realising her role in Phil's problems, Peggy decides to leave Walford for his sake. After saying tearful goodbyes to her family and making peace with Phil, Peggy takes one <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>The</b> Queen Vic and leaves Albert Square.|$|E
25|$|In the 2003 revival {{starring}} Bernadette Peters, {{the final}} dialogue scene remains, but leaves the ending open to more interpretation from the audience. Louise {{walks through the}} stage door, with Rose following behind. Rose then turns to face the audience, a look of sadness and longing on {{her face as she}} takes one <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> empty stage. She pauses and slowly closes the door.|$|E
500|$|Trott {{retained}} the captaincy when Andrew Stoddart returned to Australia with his English team in 1897–98. Stoddart's team got {{away to a}} good start when they won the First Test in Sydney by [...] nine wickets, K. S. Ranjitsinhji scoring 175runs. With Joe Darling, Trott devised a plan to curb Ranjitsinhji's run scoring. [...] An exponent of the leg glance, [...] "Ranji" [...] would take a <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> field before he took guard. [...] Taking advantage of this fact, after he took strike, the Australians deliberately weakened the off side with two men placed about [...] away from him. [...] Bowling a leg side line, the Australians aimed for a catch from a shot played to that side. Darling said of the plan, [...] "As soon as he had his last look and the bowler was at the point of delivering the ball, we shifted positions by a few yards, sometimes one way, sometimes the other. [...] Occasionally, only one would move and sometimes none would move. [...] This eventually put him clean off his game." [...] The English captain Archie MacLaren agreed saying, [...] "Ranji is in a blue funk". Regardless of the tactics, Ranji made 457runs at an average of 50.77 for the Test series.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSince we <b>last</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> market {{application}} for III–Vs in space, much has happened: {{good news and}} not-so-good news. In this article we continue the coverage we began in Issue 2, 1999 (p 20 – 25) showing how the upward market trend continues, {{both in terms of}} satellite launches and the satellites being powered by solar cells (more than two-thirds of all space vehicles today use III–V solar cells) ...|$|R

500|$|Jim (John Krasinski) deduces {{over the}} course of the day that Michael is leaving early and confronts him about it. Michael admits his plans, and begins a {{personal}} goodbye, but breaks down after a few words. Jim, trying to hold back tears, in turn says how much he respects Michael, and that Michael was the best boss he ever had and they jokingly promise to have a proper goodbye over lunch the next day. Michael's cab to the airport then arrives, and Michael departs the office after one <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> employees, exiting silently. His cab pulls out of the parking lot just as Pam is pulling in. At the airport, Michael asks the camera crew to inform him if the documentary ever airs, then turns over his microphone, quipping one last [...] "That's what she said" [...] about how good it will feel to [...] "get this thing [...] off [...] chest". He begins to walk off when Pam makes it past security and runs up to him. They hug twice and say goodbyes that are not heard by the camera. Pam says in an interview that Michael was not sad, that he was hopeful and excited to start his new life with Holly. Pam stands at the gate and watches Michael's plane take off.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the body}} of the pope was hoisted upon the steps of St. Peter's Basilica, the Papal Gentlemen turned the bier and lifted the pope's head to face the tens of {{thousands}} of people that filled St. Peter's Square. [...] Cardinal Martínez Somalo noted it as the pope's symbolic <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> devoted followers that had filled St. Peter's Square throughout the papacy of John Paul II.|$|E
2500|$|Alice {{arrives and}} takes the wine, and sees through Annabel's offer almost immediately. With Annabel refusing to offer any more, Miriam, in {{apparent}} desperation, suggests Lewis could find the money. Alice scorns this too, and, before leaving {{to go to the}} Police, stops to tell Miriam has one hell of a sister ... but before she can finish, she collapses. Miriam says she drugged the wine (her own glass having come from a different bottle in the kitchen), and a horrified Annabel watches her push Alice's body through the trapdoor and down the well. Next, she goes through Alice's handbag looking for the letter. It is not there, but her address and keys are, so she persuades Annabel to come with her to get the letter. Before Annabel leaves, she takes one <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tennis court, a tennis ball flies out of nowhere, and she screams.|$|E
60|$|With {{that horrible}} confession--without even a <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her--he left <b>the</b> room.|$|R
60|$|This he left {{lying on}} his desk where it could easily be seen. He tucked the bundle under his arm, and, with a <b>last</b> {{farewell}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> room, stole out.|$|R
60|$|We {{filled the}} three {{stockings}} hung {{by the great}} fireplace. Then, with a <b>last</b> lingering <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> brightness of the tree, {{she stood in the}} doorway and turned the electric switch.|$|R
60|$|He {{then walked}} away smartly, with a <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> besieged tower.|$|E
60|$|I {{told him}} yes. That I {{had come for}} a <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> old place before I left.|$|E
60|$|It was raining. Leaning {{forward from}} under the hood as the horses started, she took her <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lilacs.|$|E
6000|$|And perhaps, Richard," [...] he concluded, with a <b>last</b> {{lingering}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> old pile as {{he turned}} his horses, [...] "perhaps some day, I shall remember what you told us at Brooks's." ...|$|R
60|$|But it {{occurred}} to Sir Terence that in the gloom the advantage might lie slightly with himself, since the other's superior sword-play would perhaps be partly neutralised. He cast a <b>last</b> <b>look</b> round <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dark windows.|$|R
60|$|Benjamin stole a <b>last</b> bewildered <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{object in}} the chair; bowed to it, with the {{instinct}} of politeness which never failed him; and (still with {{the air of a}} man in a dream) withdrew into the next room.|$|R
60|$|She put {{the child}} down again, and turned for a <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> man whose {{happiness}} she had wrecked--in pity to him.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy took a <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rising sun, and {{followed}} him close without replying. The lads were soon {{beyond the reach of}} daylight.|$|E

60|$|Unvanquished philosopher!

5000|$|... "New Love in Town" [...] is a {{hard rock}} ballad, that was the second single {{released}} from the Swedish heavy metal band Europe's eighth studio album, <b>Last</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> Eden. <b>The</b> single was released as a digital download on 3 September 2009. It was written about Joey Tempest's son's birth.|$|R
2500|$|Steamboat {{inspectors}} Fuller and E.S. Edwards began {{investigating whether}} low {{water in the}} boiler had caused the explosion. [...] It was thought that perhaps the fireman Knowles, who was <b>last</b> seen <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> water gauge, was doing so because he had suspected the water was too low.|$|R
60|$|He took a <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> shaded green {{garden and}} left, {{whistling}} in an off key an untuneful air from a roofless farce comedy.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly Wetzel's terrible temptation, his heart-racking {{struggle}} ceased. He {{lowered the}} long, black rifle. He took one <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> chieftain's dark, powerful face.|$|E
60|$|VALENTINE. No more mud on your carpet, Miss Susan; no more coverlets {{rolled into}} balls. A good riddance. Miss Phoebe, a <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> garden.|$|E
60|$|And the younger, {{influenced}} more by {{a certain}} mysterious shake of the head than by the words, slacked his bow cheerfully; and with a <b>last</b> wide-eyed <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> little gray bird that twittered and swung so fearlessly near them, the two boys went on with their hunting.|$|R
60|$|While I am {{lifting the}} coffee-pot {{cautiously}} lest the lid {{fall into the}} cup, she is crossing to the post-office; as I select the one suitable lump of sugar she is taking six <b>last</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> letter; {{with the aid of}} William I light my cigarette, and now she is re-reading the delicious address. I lie back in my chair, and by this time she has dropped the letter down the slit. I toy with my liqueur, and she is listening to hear whether the postal authorities have come for her letter. I scowl at a fellow-member who has had the impudence to enter the smoking-room, and her two little charges are pulling her away from the post-office. When I <b>look</b> out <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window again she is gone, but I shall ring for her to-morrow at two sharp.|$|R
6000|$|... "And there's Melita Ross," [...] went on Peg. [...] "She's got {{the same}} bonnet on she had last time I was in Carlisle church six years ago.

Yez wouldn't think her mother died in the poor-house, would yez, now?" ...|$|R
60|$|Harding hesitated. He glanced savagely at Smoke, saw Pierre beckoning to Louis {{from the}} doorway, took one <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lump-gold on the table, and decided.|$|E

60|$|My {{fingers were}} numb and I was chilled through when I took a <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wretched {{men on the}} fore-yard and went below to warm up.|$|E
60|$|A {{minute or}} so longer Captain West strolled up and down, leaning easily {{into the face of}} this new and abominable gale or resting his back against it, and then he went below, pausing for a moment, his hand on the knob of the chart-room door, to cast a <b>last</b> {{measuring}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> storm-white sea and wrath-sombre sky he had mastered.|$|R
60|$|Billy {{watched him}} {{in silence for}} a moment. The truth of Bridge's {{statement}} of fact was so apparent that Billy was forced to accept the plan. A moment later he transferred the bags of loot to Bridge's pony, swung into the saddle, and took a <b>last</b> backward <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> diminishing figure of the man swinging along in the direction of Cuivaca.|$|R
6000|$|... "Everybody is going, and Ned {{says the}} supper {{is to be}} {{water-ice}} and ice-water," [...] said Polly, taking a <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> herself in <b>the</b> long mirror, when the three friends were ready on that happy evening.|$|R
