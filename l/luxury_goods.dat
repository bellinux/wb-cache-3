5|$|From 1893 Dunhill ran {{a company}} selling {{motoring}} accessories, and in 1902 opened a shop in Mayfair. He developed a pipe designed for motorists in 1904. He opened a tobacconist's shop in St James's in 1907, offering tailored tobacco blends. Shops were opened in New York and Paris in the 1920s. With his international ambitions, Dunhill {{helped to create}} the modern <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> market.

In 1924 the company launched the Unique lighter, a product that Dunhill and his brother Herbert had much interest in developing, and was the world's first lighter that could be operated with just one hand.|$|E

Diderot and d'Alembert published their Encyclopédie in 1751–52, and the Montgolfier Brothers launched the first manned flight in a hot-air balloon on 21 November 1783, from the gardens of the Château de la Muette.

5|$|The {{document}} {{proposed to}} avoid exporting money, and to include high tariffs on {{the import of}} <b>luxury</b> <b>goods.</b> This is often seen as a contradiction of The Representation of the Hacendados, but each request different things. The Representation opposed the absolute prohibition of trade with Britain, {{which is not the}} same than allowing it while following a protectionist policy. As secretary, Moreno reduced the tariffs on national exports, but kept high ones for imports.|$|E
5|$|During the 15th and 16th centuries Framlingham was at {{the heart}} of the estates of the {{powerful}} Mowbray and Howard families. Two artificial meres were built around the castle, which was expanded in fashionable brick. With a large, wealthy household to maintain, the castle purchased supplies from across England and brought in <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> from international markets. Extensive pleasure gardens were built within the castle and older parts redesigned to allow visitors to enjoy the resulting views. By the end of the 16th century, however, the castle fell into disrepair and after the final Howard owner, Theophilus, entered into financial difficulties the castle and the surrounding estates were sold off.|$|E

5|$|East coast trade hummed, with goods {{arriving}} from Golkonda where rice, millet, pulses and tobacco were grown {{on a large}} scale. Dye crops of indigo and chay root were produced for the weaving industry. A mineral rich region, Machilipatnam was the gateway for high quality iron and steel exports. Diamond mining {{was active in the}} Kollur region. The cotton weaving industry produced two types of cottons, plain calico and muslin (brown, bleached or dyed). Cloth printed with coloured patterns crafted by native techniques were exported to Java and the Far East. Golkonda specialised in plain cotton and Pulicat in printed. The main imports on the east coast were non-ferrous metals, camphor, porcelain, silk and <b>luxury</b> <b>goods.</b>|$|E

In another interview, a man purchasing sex in Thailand says that he believes the girls are happy to be working as prostitutes. Another interview features an American man who had been a sex tourist in Asia.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the vital}} {{instruments}} which facilitated long distance trade was portage and the domestication of beasts of burden. Organized caravans, visible by the 2nd millennium BCE, could carry goods across a large distance as fodder was mostly available along the way. The domestication of camels allowed Arabian nomads {{to control the}} long distance trade in spices and silk from the Far East to the Arabian Peninsula. Caravans were useful in long-distance trade largely for carrying <b>luxury</b> <b>goods,</b> the transportation of cheaper goods across large distances was not profitable for caravan operators. With productive developments in iron and bronze technologies, newer trade routes– dispensing innovations of civilizations– began to rise.|$|E

5|$|The {{customs law}} set trade {{barriers}} to products {{produced in the}} country, and imposed high import tariffs on <b>luxury</b> <b>goods,</b> together with export quotas and tariffs on gold and silver. However, the law was not completely effective because of {{the control of the}} port, which did not allow the provinces a steady financial income. The exclusive control of the port was long resisted by federals from other provinces, and led to the conflict of Rosas and Justo José de Urquiza at the battle of Caseros. Despite the financial obstacles, the economy of Entre Ríos has grew to a size near that of Buenos Aires, with the decline of saladeros and the growth of wool production.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{documentary}} {{evidence about the}} nature of trade in Æthelberht's Kent. It is known that the kings of Kent had established royal control of trade by the late seventh century, but it is not known how early this control began. There is archaeological evidence suggesting that the royal influence predates any of the written sources. It has been suggested that one of Æthelberht's achievements was to take control of trade away from the aristocracy and to make it a royal monopoly. The continental trade provided Kent access to <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> which gave it an advantage in trading with the other Anglo-Saxon nations, and the revenue from trade was important in itself.|$|E

5|$|Arable farming {{grew in the}} High Middle Ages and {{agriculture}} entered a period of relative boom between the thirteenth century and late fifteenth century. Unlike England, Scotland had no towns dating from Roman occupation. From the twelfth century there are records of burghs, chartered towns, which became major centre of crafts and trade. There are also Scottish coins, although English coinage probably remained more significant in trade, and {{until the end of}} the period barter was probably the most common form of exchange. Craft and industry remained relatively undeveloped before the end of the Middle Ages and, although there were extensive trading networks based in Scotland, while the Scots exported largely raw materials, they imported increasing quantities of <b>luxury</b> <b>goods,</b> resulting in a bullion shortage and perhaps helping to create a financial crisis in the fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Because {{value added}} tax (VAT) {{has not been}} levied in the island, <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, {{providing}} an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led {{to the growth of}} the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the States of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. Low-value consignment relief provided the mechanism for VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was binned.|$|E

The city has a growing middle class, driving the market for modern consumer and <b>luxury</b> <b>goods.</b> Restaurants, shopping malls and luxury hotels continue to serve as vital elements in the city's economy. The city has historically attracted numerous migrant workers.

Half the workforce is employed in household and unorganised labour, while about 800,000 work in the textile industry. The unemployment rate in Dhaka was 23% in 2013. Dhaka has improved congestion and inadequate infrastructure; the national government has recently implemented a policy for rapid urbanization of surrounding areas and beyond by the introduction of a ten-year relief on income tax for new construction of facilities and buildings outside Dhaka.|$|E

5|$|Limited sources {{indicate}} for {{the early}} Middle Ages indicate {{that there was some}} trade of <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> with continental Europe. For most of the period there are not the detailed custom accounts that exist for England, that can provide an understanding of foreign trade, with the first records for Scotland dating to the 1320s. In the early Middle Ages, the rise of Christianity meant that wine and precious metals were imported for use in religious rites, and there are occasional references of trips to and from foreign countries, such as the incident recorded by Adomnán in which St Columba went to a port to await ships bearing news, and presumably other items, from Italy. Imported goods found in archaeological sites of the period include ceramics and glass, while many sites indicate iron and precious metal working.|$|E
5|$|London held {{a special}} status within the English economy. The nobility {{purchased}} and consumed many <b>luxury</b> <b>goods</b> {{and services in}} the capital, and {{as early as the}} 1170s the London markets were providing exotic products such as spices, incense, palm oil, gems, silks, furs and foreign weapons. London was also an important hub for industrial activity; it had many blacksmiths making a wide range of goods, including decorative ironwork and early clocks. Pewter-working, using English tin and lead, was also widespread in London during the period. The provincial towns also had a substantial number of trades {{by the end of the}} 13th century – a large town like Coventry, for example, contained over three hundred different specialist occupations, and a smaller town such as Durham could support some sixty different professions. The increasing wealth of the nobility and the church was reflected in the widespread building of cathedrals and other prestigious buildings in the larger towns, in turn making use of lead from English mines for roofing.|$|E

The film contrasts the secretiveness and brutality of the sex industry in Eastern Europe with the openness of public prostitution in the Netherlands. Nefarious suggests that sex trafficking in Southeast Asia is fuelled largely by the complicity of the victims' parents, with many in Cambodia grooming and then knowingly selling their daughters into prostitution to pay for <b>luxury</b> <b>goods.</b> The film asserts that 10% of the population of Moldova has been sexually trafficked. Nefarious contrasts Las Vegas prostitutes with victims of sex trafficking in Europe, depicting the former as drawn into the sex industry by dreams of a glamorous lifestyle, and the latter as made vulnerable by child abandonment and orphanages.|$|E
