40|$|Abstract Background Exposure to {{ultrafine}} particles exerts diverse {{harmful effects}} including aggravation of pulmonary diseases like asthma. Recently we demonstrated in a mouse model for allergic airway inflammation that particle-derived oxidative stress plays {{a crucial role}} during augmentation of allergen-induced lung inflammation by ultrafine carbon particle (UfCP) inhalation. The mechanisms how particle inhalation might change the inflammatory balance in the lungs, leading to accelerated inflammatory reactions, remain unclear. <b>Lipid</b> <b>mediators,</b> known to be immediately generated in response to tissue injury, might be strong candidates for priming this particle-triggered change of the inflammatory balance. Methods We hypothesize that inhalation of UfCP may disturb the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory <b>lipid</b> <b>mediators</b> in: i) a model for acute allergic pulmonary inflammation, exposing mice for 24 h before allergen challenge to UfCP inhalation (51. 7 nm, 507 μg/m 3), and ii) an in-vitro model with primary rat alveolar macrophages (AM) incubated with UfCP (10 μg/ 1 x 10 6 cells/ml) for 1 h. Lungs and AM were analysed for pro- and anti-inflammatory <b>lipid</b> <b>mediators,</b> namely leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4), prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), 15 (S) -hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (15 (S) -HETE), lipoxin A 4 (LXA 4) and oxidative stress marker 8 -isoprostane by enzyme immunoassays and immunohistochemistry. Results In non-sensitized mice UfCP exposure induced a light non-significant increase of all <b>lipid</b> <b>mediators.</b> Similarly but significantly in rat AM all <b>lipid</b> <b>mediators</b> were induced already within 1 h of UfCP stimulation. Also sensitized and challenge mice exposed to filtered air showed a partially significant increase in all <b>lipid</b> <b>mediators.</b> In sensitized and challenged mice UfCP exposure induced highest significant levels of all <b>lipid</b> <b>mediators</b> in the lungs together with the peak of allergic airway inflammation on day 7 after UfCP inhalation. The levels of LTB 4, 8 -isoprostane and PGE 2 were significantly increased also one day after UfCP exposure. Immunohistochemistry localized highest concentrations of PGE 2 especially in AM one day after UfCP exposure. Conclusion Our results suggest that UfCP exposure affects the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory <b>lipid</b> <b>mediators.</b> In allergic mice, where the endogenous balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators is already altered, UfCP exposure aggravates the inflammation and the increase in anti-inflammatory, pro-resolving <b>lipid</b> <b>mediators</b> is insufficient to counterbalance the extensive inflammatory response. This may be a contributing mechanism that explains the increased susceptibility of asthmatic patients towards particle exposure. </p...|$|R

50|$|Studies in cultured {{human lung}} {{epithelial}} cells {{infected with the}} influenza virus H1N1 or H5N1 have found that endogenous production of PD1 decreases dramatically during infection due to the inhibition of 15-LO-1. Furthermore, the same {{studies have shown that}} in vivo administration of PD1 to H1N1 infected mice can potentially inhibit both the proliferation of the virus and the inflammation caused by the infection, thus increasing survival. Interestingly, PD1 protects against viral infections by disrupting the virus life cycle. Specifically, PD1 inhibits the binding of viral RNA to specific nuclear export factors in the host cells, thus blocking the export of viral RNA from the nucleus to the cytosol. The nuclear RNA export factor 1(NXF1) is of particular interest in the attenuation of viral infections via the activity of PD1. Specifically, the NXF1 transporter through its middle and C-terminal domains binds to the phenylalanine/glycine repeats in the nucleoporins (Nups) that line the nuclear pore. In the absence of PD1, influenza viral RNA binds to the NXF1 transporter that later binds specifically to Nup62 nucleoporin and exports the viral RNA into the cytosol.

50|$|Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the anti-inflammatory and other beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acid-rich diets are due at least in part to their metabolic conversion to resolvins. However, a recent translational study questions the notion that resolvins {{and other members of the}} SPM family are indeed formed in the human body from omega-3 PUFA. This study failed to detect a consistent signal of resolvin formation in urine or plasma of healthy volunteers who had taken fish oil. This study also found no alteration in the formation of resolvins during the resolution of inflammation which was induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide in these volunteers. By contrast, formation of a series of established enzymatic and nonenzymatic oxidation products formed from omega-3 PUFA could readily be demonstrated in vivo. On this basis, the study authors concluded that their study fails to provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that resolvins mediate an anti-inflammatory action of fish oil. Further information can be found in a commentary accompanying this translational work. This commentary indicated that the area of dietary omega-3 PUFA in the prevention and amelioration of inflammatory diseases remains somewhat clouded with contradictory results, controversial, and in need of further rigorous study. It will be important to establish the production and presence of resolvins and other SPMs given their potent protective actions in humans. In this regard, using rigorous and validated mass spectrometry based methods many human tissues and cell types have been shown to produce SPM in ror example, human white blood cells such as macrophages, serum, lymph nodes, and spleen, urine, placenta, diseased kidney, and, importantly, in milk from lactating mothers. Expert investigators in this field of resolution biology and physiology are now able to simultaneoulsy identify and measure both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory-pro-resolving mediators such as the SPM in human tissues.

This chronic “low-grade” inflammation in white adipose tissue is powerfully augmented through the infiltration of macrophages, which, together with adipocytes, perpetuate a vicious cycle of macrophage recruitment and secretion of free fatty acids and deleterious adipokines that predispose the development of obesity-related comorbidities, such as insulin resistance and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In the last decade, many factors have been identified that contribute to mounting uncontrolled inflammation in obese adipose tissue. Among them, bioactive <b>lipid</b> <b>mediators</b> derived from the cyclooxygenase and 5 -lipoxygenase pathways, which convert the ω- 6 -polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) arachidonic acid into potent proinflammatory eicosanoids (i. e., prostaglandins [PGs] and leukotrienes), have emerged.

Human subjects undertook a single bout of unaccustomed resistance exercise (80 % of one repetition maximum) following oral ingestion of ibuprofen (400 mg) or placebo control. Venous blood was collected during early recovery (0 – 3 h and 24 h postexercise), and serum <b>lipid</b> <b>mediator</b> composition was analyzed by LC-MS-based targeted lipidomics. Postexercise recovery was characterized by elevated levels of cyclooxygenase (COX) - 1 and 2 -derived prostanoids (TXB 2, PGE 2, PGD 2, PGF 2 α, and PGI 2), lipooxygenase (5 -LOX, 12 -LOX, and 15 -LOX) -derived hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), and leukotrienes (e. g., LTB 4), and epoxygenase (CYP) -derived epoxy/dihydroxy eicosatrienoic acids (EpETrEs/DiHETrEs). Additionally, we detected elevated levels of bioactive lipid mediators with anti-inflammatory and proresolving properties, including arachidonic acid-derived lipoxins (LXA 4 and LXB 4), and the EPA (E-series) and DHA (D-series) -derived resolvins (RvD 1 and RvE 1), and protectins (PD 1 isomer 10 S, 17 S-diHDoHE).

Methods: Eighty-seven <b>lipid</b> <b>mediators</b> representing the cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX) and cytochrome P 450 (CYP) metabolic pathways were screened via LC-MS/MS following off-line extraction of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Multivariate statistics using OPLS were employed to interrogate acquired oxylipin data in combination with immunological markers. Results: Thirty-two oxylipins were quantified, with baseline asthmatics possessing a different oxylipin profile relative to healthy individuals that became more distinct following allergen provocation. The most prominent differences included 15 -LOX-derived v- 3 and v- 6 oxylipins. Shared-and-Unique-Structures (SUS) -plot modeling showed a correlation (R 2 = 0. 7...|$|R
