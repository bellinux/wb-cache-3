40|$|Wood is an {{important}} economical resource for many tropical countries. Among the benefits {{of most of the}} tropical woody species, we can mention their natural durability and their capacity of withstanding outside environment without the use of chemical preservatives. Also, many of these tropical species show undeniable properties that people looked for such as aesthetic appearance and good mechanical property. Different marking systems are available in order to facilitate the traceability of wood but they present some limitations in their use at a larger scale. This study aims at developing a reliable technique to asses the geographical origin of different wood species. Wood can be colonized by destroying fungal microorganisms known as endophyte. The main objective of this work is to use these microorganisms as a molecular marker. An amplification of the ITS region has been done and used with CE-SSCP on tree different tropical species from 6 countries: Limba (Terminalia superba), <b>Limbali</b> (Gilbertiodendron dewerei-preussii) and Teak (Tectona grandis). Results show a grouping among different microbial profiles related to the wood species and discernment between Limba and <b>Limbali.</b> We show that microbial profiles {{could be used as a}} marker to ensure the proper origin of wood as part of an ecocertification for sustainable management of the forest. Also, they will help in controlling the itinerary of a wood product from forest to consumer. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Volume {{equations}} {{predict the}} volume of the stem of a tree from dendrometrical characteristics that are easy to measure, such as diameter and/or height. These equations can serve as a surrogate for biomass equations, by converting the stem volume to stem biomass, and then expanding it to the total aboveground biomass. This is especially important for Central Africa where biomass equations are scarce, whereas volume equations are common. We measured the stem volume of 459 trees in the Yoko forest, Orientale province, Democratic Republic of Congo. These trees belonged to three species: Gilbertiodendron dewevrei (<b>limbali),</b> Guarea thompsonii (bossé foncé) and Scorodophloeus zenkeri (divida). Species-specific volume equations were fitted using these data, and biomass estimates were derived from these volume equations. The fitted volume equations were consistent with other location-specific volume equations for the same species. The biomass estimates derived from the fitted volume equations were also found to be consistent with multispecies pantropical biomass equations. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Traceability {{is defined}} {{according}} to ISO 9000 {{as the ability}} to retrieve the origin and use of an article or an activity through a registered method. Its implementation in the timber industry is delayed because of limits of classical identification systems with regard to the nature of timber and features of the manufacturing process. One hypothesis of tracing the source of timber and its products is by analysing in a global way the microbial communities of timber and linking this analysis statistically to its geographical origin. We proposed a very innovative tool of fungi ecology, the polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), that was used to characterise the fungi flora of two tropical timbers species, teak and <b>limbali</b> from four countries: Côte d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Central African Republic and French Polynesia. The aim was to show if there was statistical relation between the fungal communities of the timbers and their geographical origins. PCR-DGGE method is a new, simple and cheap traceability tool that can trace the original locations of timbers. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|Nonexpert citizen {{groups are}} being used to monitor species to track {{ecosystem}} changes; however, challenges remain for proper identification, especially among diverse groups such as beetles. Tiger beetles, Cicindela spp., have been used for biological diversity monitoring because of their diversity and the ease of recognition. The finding of an apparent hybrid zone among Cicindela denverensis Casey, Cicindela <b>limbalis</b> Klug, and Cicindela splendida Hentz in central Nebraska prompted a detailed study of the biogeography of this species group within Nebraska, a test of characteristics that could be used by citizen scientists, and limited breeding experiments. This study suggests that while C. denverensis appears to hybridize with both C. <b>limbalis</b> and C. splendida within the hybrid zone, all three species maintain their integrity across most of their ranges, largely occupy unique geographic regions, and at least C. denverensis and C. splendida cooccur in many areas with no evidence of hybridization. Evidence of hybridization between C. <b>limbalis</b> and C. splendida was found at only two sites. Furthermore, breeding experiments with virgin C. splendida and C. denverensis showed that they are capable of producing hybrid larvae in the laboratory. The presence of morphological intergrades serves as a cautionary note when using biological indicator species...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The {{communicative}} {{behavior of}} five species and subspecies of Tropisternus Solier (Coleoptera: Hydrophilidae) was studied. These aquatic beetles have stress and calling chirps (both sexes), a second male calling signal (one species), a single male courtship sound (usually), a male copulatory sound, {{and a female}} aggressive rejection buzz (three species). Males utilize visual, not acoustical, clues to orient towards females at close range. Males court females with stereotyped movements, sounds, and tactile signals while positioned dorsally on the female. The role of chemical signals in recognition of sexual readiness, sex, or species remains unclear. A mark-release field study of T. ellipticus ruled out aggregation and territorial behavior as possible functions of acoustic signals. This species, at least, wanders freely and has no home range. Acoustic courtship signals were stereotyped, i. e., the same signal was always produced by males in particular positions of courtship, in T. natator and T. columbianus, but variable in T. ellipticus and two subspecies of T. lateralis. Experiments using models of beetles indicated that visual stimuli can release a calling chirp response and an approach in both sexes, or a courtship sound and an approach in males. Results of experiments utilizing broadcasts of tape recorded signals established that Tropisternus can hear water-borne acoustic signals even though auditory receptors are as yet unknown in Coleoptera. Males of T. natator and T. lateralis nimbatus discriminated female calling chirps from other acoustic signals. Female calling chirps stimulated males to emit calling chirps, to cease feeding and begin swimming, and to approach models of beetles (searching behavior). Males of T. ellipticus and T. lateralis <b>limbalis,</b> species from populations in western Oregon, did not respond predictably to acoustic signals. T. natator and T. lateralis nimbatus, which responded to calling chirps, are from populations in southern Michigan, where four species of Tropisternus share breeding sites. In contrast, the three species in western Oregon probably breed in different microhabitats. The lack of mating interference between species in western Oregon may have allowed the loosening of stereotypy in courtship seen in T. ellipticus and the degeneration of the calling function of acoustic signals seen in T. ellipticus and T. lateralis <b>limbalis...</b>|$|R
