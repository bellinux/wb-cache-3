Spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said that the Vatican was following events [...] "with extreme apprehension". A spokesman for Catholic monks in the Holy Land accused the Israelis of [...] "indescribable act of barbarity". The Vatican's top foreign policy expert Archbishop Jean-Louis Taura stated that while the Palestinians have joined the Vatican in bilateral agreements where they have undertaken to respect and {{maintain the status quo}} regarding Christian holy places and the rights of Christian communities, [...] "to explain the gravity of the current situation, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>begin</b> {{with the fact that the}} occupation of the holy places by armed men is a violation of a long tradition of law that dates back to the Ottoman era. Never before have they been occupied – for such a lengthy time – by armed men." [...] Pope John Paul II urged people to pray for peace in the Middle East and described the violence as having reached [...] "unimaginable and intolerable" [...] levels. Israeli Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, said the Israeli soldiers would not [...] "defile the holiness of the site as the [...] have". He also said that the troops would remain in place until the militants inside were captured. British Foreign Office Minister, Ben Bradshaw described Israeli actions in the area as [...] "totally unacceptable".|$|E

All of my friends are brilliant people who have worked very hard to get their degrees and their corporate jobs but as I was awarded my degree, I was unaware of how little I questioned the texts we read or the privilege I was surrounded by. A year in the Sociology department has changed me, it’s an ongoing process and I am not going to pretend I can fully comprehend my own privilege (or classical Sociology’s writing styles) but I am making progress...|$|R

The publication noted that when its release widened to over 200 theatres the previous weekend its per-theatre average was so low that its distributor decided to cut its screens in the succeeding weeks. Based on answers from film experts and executives for Fox Searchlight, there were five factors to why the film commercially disappointed: its timing, airing {{too early in the}} year when lighter summer fare is still popular; a novel that is particularly difficult to adapt; mixed reviews from critics; its depressing tone; and its lack of appeal to male viewers.

First and foremost, I want to thank my first reader and thesis director Dr. Lori Pollock, for <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>begin</b> this quest and then helping me get through it. I also owe signficant thanks to Dr. Chrystalla Mouza, who helped me through the educational research components, a challenging lesson for a Computer Science major. I thank Dr. James Glancey for serving on my committee and providing the wonderful idea of adding the “Wackiness ” to Wacky Writer. And, of course, no thesis would be possible without the amazing work by the venerable Meg Meiman. I owe much thanks to Margaret Spagnolo for her delightful artwork in Broadway. Thanks also needs to go to Dr. Michael Arnold, Ms. Susan Katz, and the Distinguished Scholars program for providing funds to hire an artist. Broadway would also not be possible without the work by Robert Deaton — who wrote the Spyral library used in Pygame and provided much additional help with the XO laptops — and Phil Hassey — author of the PGU library, without which Broadway {{would not have}} a User Interface. I extend deep thanks also to the students and teachers at The College School, who provided me much valuable data and feedback on the Learning Activities. In particular, Laurie Drumm and her colleagues were invaluable in this process. Once I got into the classroom, I am appreciative that I had Meredith Greer and Jason Rubenstein to assist me.

That admirable communication, reaching me at the climax of the London June, found me in a great tangle of difficulties over the command of my time and general conduct of my correspondence and other obligations; so that after a vain invocation of a better promptness where you were concerned, I took heart from the fact that I was soon to be at peace down here, and that hence I should be able to address you at my ease. I have in fact been here but a few days, and my slight further delay has but risen from the fact that I brought down with me so many letters to answer!--though none of them, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> say, <b>begins</b> to affect <b>me</b> with the beauty and interest of yours.|$|R

Not to be forgotten are fellow graduate students within my laboratory for providing assistance during challenging moments. For their time and assistance within this project, I also would like to express gratitude to Dr. Buddy Creech, Dr. Erik Skaar, and Brian McKenna. Their insight within the ever-important study of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) will help countless people around the world.

The furniture is of the very richest, and kept with the most fastidious cleanliness. The floors of precious wood are polished like mirrors. The rooms have every appliance for the ease of the luxurious inmates. Everywhere you see, not mere brute wealth, but taste, purity, and comfort. There is no lack of intellect either:--wise and learned books fill the library shelves; maps and scientific instruments crowd the tables. Nor of religion either;--for the house contains a private chapel, fitted up in the richest style of mediaeval ecclesiastical art. And as you walk along from polished floor to polished floor, you seem to pass in review every object which the body, or the mind, or the spirit, of the most civilized human being can need for its satisfaction.|$|R

It <b>began</b> in May 1987 and was preceded by a two-week press tour that saw Bowie visit nine countries throughout Europe and North America to drum up public interest in the tour. The Glass Spider Tour was the first Bowie tour to visit Austria, Italy, Spain, Ireland and Wales. Through a sponsorship from Pepsi, the tour was intended to visit Russia and South America as well, but these plans were later cancelled. The tour was, at that point, the longest and most expensive tour Bowie had embarked upon in his career. At the time, the tour's elaborate set was called [...] "the largest touring set ever".|$|R
40|$|I thank Ministro Guido Mantega and the {{authorities}} of the IMF for {{the invitation to}} participate in this conference. Any policy recommendation is influenced by one’s conjectures about the future. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> thus <b>begin</b> with my own conjectures about the prospects of emerging market economies. It seems clear that the current wave of capital inflows to emerging markets is influenced by the high returns that assets from these countries offer in comparison with those from advanced countries. The low rates of growth and interest rates in advanced countries are most likely a transitory phenomenon. Their real and financial yields will both probably rise in a near future. In any case, I think that the high growth emerging markets have been experiencing since the early 2000 s will last for a long period. This seems to me a more persistent phenomenon. Although growth rates of emerging markets and advanced countries had shown a high correlation since the 1980 s, they started to diverge in the 2000 s {{for the first time in}} the period of financial globalization (WEO, October 2010). This trend has persisted during and after the global financia...|$|R
