Similar ratings were created for the lighter-than-air branch of aviation, termed Military Aeronaut. [...] On 18 July 1914, Congress established the Aviation Section, Signal Corps, incorporating, expanding and superseding the Aeronautical Division, and established in law both flight pay ( [...] called the [...] "aviation increase") and the awarding of ratings. The Act of 1914 authorized an aviation increase of 25% in pay to student pilots, 50% to those rated JMA, and 75% to those rated MA. Rated lieutenants who flew [...] "regularly and frequently" [...] were given the temporary rank, pay, and allowances of the next higher grade.|$|E

[...] The introduction of a testing program by the CDAA in 1974, which involved the assessment of prospective cave divers' cave diving ability led to a reduced fatality rate. [...] In 1989, this testing system was replaced by a training system which consists of three <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>qualification</b> - Deep Cavern, Cave and Advanced Cave. Five further deaths have occurred since 1974; two died at Piccaninnie Ponds in 1984, one person died at Kilsbys Hole in 2010, and two people died in separate incidents at Tank Cave in 2011 including noted cave diver Agnes Milowka.|$|E

A further study of those graduates found that they felt they lacked, job experience, communication skills, and qualifications relevant to the current job market.

The optimal training policy is discontinuous and our model does not exclude the possibility of lack of training policy. Indeed, for a low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>qualification,</b> firms have no incentive to provide training to workers. Finally, the model shows that {{the profile of the}} efficiency wage increases with the amount of training, hence our theory is able to explain the positive correlation between high wages and training. ...|$|R
