40|$|Policies such as Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) which aim {{to assist}} farmers with biomass {{production}} may {{act as a}} double-edged sword. On one hand, they lure farmers to adopt biomass production in the short term. On the other hand, they can’t be irresponsible for farmers’ abandonment of biomass production in the long run. The paper sharpens this idea in a principal-agent setting and argues that by offering a timely <b>loyalty</b> <b>premium</b> the agents’ take-and-run behavior can be mitigated. Moreover, the model shows that effort and investment in human capital are increasing in <b>loyalty</b> <b>premium</b> when agents decide to continue providing biomass after testing-water contract expires.

40|$|Abstract: Defined by Baker and Wurgler (2004 a), <b>dividend</b> <b>premium</b> is the {{difference}} between the average market-to-book ratio of dividend payers and non-payers. We study what <b>dividend</b> <b>premium</b> is by examining two explanations, agency explanation and signaling explanation. Using U. S. industrial firms from 1962 to 2004, we find evidence consistent with the agency theory that <b>dividend</b> <b>premium</b> is higher when the need to mitigate the agency problem is greater. In particular, <b>dividend</b> <b>premium</b> is positively related to {{the difference}} in cash holdings {{at the beginning of the}} year between dividend payers and nonpayers, and is negatively related to the difference in future profitability between dividend payers and nonpayers. In other words, investors value dividend payers with a higher <b>premium</b> when <b>dividend</b> payers have more cash and fewer profitable future investment projects than nonpayers. 1...|$|R
40|$|In Malaysia, motorists are {{required}} by law to insure minimum coverage for their automobiles. However, the policy they own and the insurer they choose may not suit their needs. This study examines several characteristics which influence consumers’ selection of auto insurance policy and their loyalty to one insurer. Data were collected from a survey of 178 randomly selected respondents. A chi-square analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between age, race, gender, education background and automobiles’ market value to the selection of auto insurance policy. In addition, the relationship between <b>premium,</b> <b>dividend,</b> insurer’s internal factors, claim services and non-claim services to the loyalty of the consumer are also tested using the chi-square and Spearman rank test. The results indicate that education background and market value of the automobile are significant characteristics in selecting auto insurance policy, while <b>premium,</b> <b>dividend,</b> insurer internal factors, claim and non-claim services are not related to the loyalty of the consumer. The study reveals that such results were attributed to the lack of industry information and the role of auto salesperson. For future research, the issue should be examined with a larger set of data to represent the industry bette...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose that}} the {{catering}} theory of dividends will not hold when tested with an extended sample period, different formulations of the <b>dividend</b> <b>premium,</b> and subsets of our sample divided by industry. The catering theory implies that managers cater to irrational and timevarying investor demand for dividends. This demand can be proxied by a <b>dividend</b> <b>premium,</b> {{a comparison of the}} market-to-book ratio of payers versus non-payers. The <b>dividend</b> <b>premium</b> that the catering model is based on suffers from a very arbitrary derivation. We find that coefficients for the regression of catering using an extended sample period and different derivations of the <b>dividend</b> <b>premium</b> give results with smaller economic and statistical significance. Furthermore, tests of our sample by industry show that the <b>dividend</b> <b>premium,</b> supposedly a market-wide measure that affects all firms, has different effects on various industries. Though the catering theory finds significance given a particular methodology, further analysis shows that the model is based on spurious correlation, and not true causation. by Alexander W. Lue.

The premia are estimated using a theory-informed Bayesian model that admits structural breaks. The equity premium fell from 8. 16 % in 1951 to 1. 15 % in 1985. Approximately half of this decline was reversion of a high conditional premium to the long run mean and the remainder resulted from {{a decline in the}} expected stock return.

40|$|Differentiated {{dividends}} are {{a unique}} cash dividend payment scheme prevailing in Korea which allows managers {{to pay higher}} cash dividends to small shareholders than large shareholders. One of the important features of this dividend policy is that it provides an additional choice to managers when deciding on changing firms' dividend policy. Previous studies suggest that managers are expected to initiate differentiated dividends rather than stop paying dividends especially when their company is facing cash constraints. However, we find that a half of the firms changing to differentiated dividend are actually increasing their total dividend payment. In order to explain managers' motivation to initiate differentiated dividends, we employ the time varying fads, <b>dividend</b> <b>premium,</b> suggested by Baker and Wurgler. After conducting logit regressions, we find that <b>dividend</b> <b>premium</b> is positively associated with managers' incentive to initiate differentiated dividends especially when they increase total dividend amount. Also, the firms listed in different stock markets show different motivations when choosing to initiate different dividends...|$|R

40|$|This study {{compares the}} cash {{dividend}} policy of Chinese firms listed in Hong Kong {{and on the}} Mainland. It shows that, in both groups, firms that have higher managerial membership on the board tend to pay lower cash dividends. The relation is stronger in Mainland-listed firms, indicating that managers' influence on the board creates more serious agency problems. This study further shows that ownership concentration of Mainland-listed firms tends to weaken the association between managerial membership {{on the board and}} lower cash dividends, suggesting that concentrated ownership in the Mainland reduces the agency cost. Finally, this study shows that there is a price <b>premium</b> attaching to <b>dividend</b> payout of HK-listed Chinese firms, but there is no such premium in the Mainland market. Further, the same <b>dividend</b> <b>premium</b> is also observed in local firms listed in Hong Kong. Taken together, this study indicates that the pricing mechanism of Hong Kong's equity market appears to encourage managers of HK-listed firms to pay dividends. The same mechanism is not found to exist in the Mainland market. This difference helps to explain the finding that the controlling shareholders of HK-listed firms take a less active role in dividend policy than those of their peers on the Mainland. Thus, Hong Kong's equity market seems to provide a mechanism that can be used by Chinese firms listed there. ...|$|R

40|$|The first essay {{examines}} {{the impact of}} insider trading law enforcement on dividend payout policy. We posit and confirm that firms use dividend payouts to mitigate agency costs caused by gaps in country-level investor protection. We find that first-time enforcement of insider trading laws leads to a lower likelihood of paying dividends, lower dividend amounts, lower dividend smoothing and target payout ratios. We also show that market value of dividends declines significantly following the enforcement of insider trading laws. These results suggest that dividends serve as a substitute bonding mechanism through which managers establish a reputation for the fair treatment of minority shareholders when insider trading is not restricted. Firms mitigate the shortcomings of a weak institutional environment by committing to higher and more consistent payout policies. ^ The second essay investigates the interaction among dividend smoothing, equity value and agency costs. Using a comprehensive cross-country sample from 21 countries, we show that market puts a <b>premium</b> on smooth <b>dividends</b> and dividend smoothing increases with agency costs of equity. Most importantly, {{we find that the}} <b>premium</b> for smooth <b>dividends</b> is decreasing in shareholder rights, suggesting that when agency costs are small the market puts a low <b>premium</b> on smooth <b>dividends.</b> The bonding framework of dividend smoothing might also shed some light on why smoothing in the US has increased over time. Consistent with our findings, we argue that the necessity to smooth dividends has increased over time due to increasing repurchase-for-dividend substitution that is previously documented in Grullon and Michaely (2002). Further analyses show that on average $ 1 paid out through dividends contributes to equity value by about 40 % more than $ 1 paid out in repurchases using the most conservative model. Put differently, in order not to reduce the value of equity, firms need to substitute $ 1. 4 in repurchases for $ 1 decrease in dividends. To manage the enormous payout burden of dividend-repurchase substitution and to maximize equity value, managers have been increasingly compelled to make dividends smoother. Consistently, we show that firms that pay smoother dividends substitute dividends for repurchases at 23 % faster rate than the firms with less smooth dividends. Overall, these results support the view that dividend smoothing is a bonding mechanism used to undo the agency cost discount on equity valuation. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{has three}} essays. In the first essay, I investigate whether {{the decision to}} repurchase stock is driven by investor demand for repurchases. Specifically, I hypothesize that firms cater to investor demand for repurchases by initiating repurchases when investors place premiums on the stock prices of repurchasing firms. I propose proxies (analogous to Baker and Wurgler (2004)) that measure the repurchase premium. I find that the lagged repurchase premium is positively and significantly related to repurchase initiation and continuation decisions, even after controlling for tax effects, year trends and alternate investment opportunities. I find that a greater fraction of dividend paying firms also repurchase stock when the repurchase premium has been high. The fraction of dividend payers that repurchase stock {{is found to be}} negatively related to the lagged <b>dividend</b> <b>premium,</b> establishing the competing attractiveness of dividends and repurchases based on the respective <b>dividend</b> and repurchase <b>premium.</b> Firms are more likely to repurchase stock when the repurchase premium is high and the difference between the repurchase and <b>dividend</b> <b>premium</b> is positive. The second essay looks at a relatively new way of buying back shares, called Accelerated Share Repurchases (ASRs). ASRs are credible commitments by firms to repurchase shares immediately. Including an ASR in a repurchase program reduces the flexibility that firms have to alter an announced program in response to subsequent changes in the price and liquidity of its stock, unexpected shocks to cash flow and/or investment, etc. We investigate whether firms' decisions to include ASRs in their repurchase programs are associated with factors expected to influence the costs of lost flexibility and the benefits of enhanced credibility and immediacy. The third essay looks at stock market trading characteristics around ASR announcements. I find that the trading costs decrease following an ASR announcement. On average, market quality improves; trading volume increases; and trade size increases following an ASR announcement. The information asymmetry component of spread also increases post ASR...|$|R
