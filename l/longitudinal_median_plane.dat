40|$|Recently Mr. Osborne, {{the fruit}} {{expert in the}} Agricultural Department, handed me an apple of which {{one-half}} was typical Roman Beauty and the other as surely Senator. There was no blending; the division was <b>longitudinal</b> through the <b>median</b> <b>plane</b> and as clearly defined as {{it was possible to}} be. The apple was grown in the orchard of Mr. Bourne, Premaydena, South-East Tasmania. The following note is sent with it from Mr. Ward, assistant fruit instructor:— "The apple was picked from a Roman Beauty tree which had been grafted on a Senator stock. The tree is young, as far as I know seven or eight years old. This was the only apple of its kind on the tree. " Judging from its history and appearance there seems little escape from the conclusion that this is a genuine case of graft hybridism. Reversion would not have given us a fruit with such a well-marked distinction of character in the two halves.

40|$|Background. Previously, Balki {{determined}} the Pearson correlation coefficient {{with the use}} of ultrasound (US) was 0. 85 in morbidly obese parturients. We aimed to determine if the use of the epidural depth equation (EDE) in conjunction with US can provide better clinical correlation in estimating the distance from the skin to the epidural space in morbidly obese parturients. Methods. One hundred sixty morbidly obese (≥ 40 [*]kg/m 2) parturients requesting labor epidural analgesia were enrolled. Before epidural catheter placement, EDE was used to estimate depth to the epidural space. This estimation was used to help visualize the epidural space with the transverse and midline longitudinal US views and to measure depth to epidural space. The measured epidural depth was made available to the resident trainee before needle insertion. Actual needle depth (ND) to the epidural space was recorded. Results. Pearson’s correlation coefficients comparing actual (ND) versus US estimated depth to the epidural space in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>median</b> and transverse <b>planes</b> were 0. 905 (95 % CI: 0. 873 to 0. 929) and 0. 899 (95 % CI: 0. 865 to 0. 925), respectively. Conclusion. Use of the epidural depth equation (EDE) in conjunction with the longitudinal and transverse US views results in better clinical correlation than {{with the use of}} US alone...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} {{a comparison between}} the experimental and numerical results on the flow around a Bolund Island 1 : 705 scale model. A boundary layer wind tunnel with expansion stage was used for experimental modelling [9]. Velocity fields were determined using Constant Temperature Anemometry (CTA) and Particle image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements. Unsteady numerical simulations were performed using a Reynolds Average Navier Stokes (RANS) turbulence model adapted to atmospheric boundary layer flows [6] which was implemented in the ANSYS FLUENT expert software. At the beginning, the wind tunnel with expansion stage was explored and measurements were performed to determine the flow characteristics in the experimental vein. Data from CTA measurements in the <b>median</b> <b>longitudinal</b> <b>plane,</b> in eleven sections located at different distances from the expansion stage were used to determine mean velocity ant turbulence intensity profiles. Comparison with real data from the Bolund experiment showed a good agreement with the wind tunnel measurements. The experimental 1 : 705 scale model of the Bolund Island was manufactured on a CNC machine using the topographical data provided by the Risø DTU team from the Bolund experiment. Same data was used to build the mesh which virtually replicates the model placed in the experimental vein of the wind tunnel. PIV measurements were performed {{in order to determine the}} velocity, turbulence intensity and vorticity contours in a vertical reference plane and then compared to the URANS numerical simulation results...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of optimal three-dimensional auditory displays requires {{a more complete}} understand-ing of the interactions among spatially separated sounds. Free-field masking was investigated {{as a function of}} the spatial separation between signal and masker sounds within the horizontal, frontal, and <b>median</b> <b>planes.</b> The detectability of filtered pulse trains in the presence of noise maskers was measured using a cued, two-alternative, forced-choice, adaptive staircase procedure. Signal and masker combinations in low (below 2. 3 kHz), middle (1. 0 - 8. 5 kHz), and high (above 3. 5 kHz) frequency regions were examined. As the sound sources were separated within the horizontal plane, signal detectability increased dramatically. Similar im-provement in detectability was observed within the frontal plane. As suggested by traditional binaural models, interaural time cues and interaural intensity cues are likely to play a major role in mediating masking release in both the horizontal and frontal planes. Because no interaural cues exist for stimuli presented within the <b>median</b> <b>plane,</b> traditional models would not predict a release from masking when the stimuli are separated within this plane. However, with high frequency signals, masking release similar to that observed in the horizontal and frontal planes could be observed in the <b>median</b> <b>plane.</b> The current literature suggests that sound localization in the <b>median</b> <b>plane</b> may depend on direction-specific spectral cues that are introduced by the pinna at high frequencies. The masking release observed here may also depend on these “pinna cues. ...|$|R

We discuss the time evolution of the magnetic flux density in the holes during a pulse and measure the time taken by the external magnetic flux to reach each hole. Our data show that the flux front moves faster in the <b>median</b> <b>plane</b> than on the surface when penetrating the sample edge; it then proceeds faster along the surface than in the bulk as it penetrates the sample further. Once the pulse is over, the trapped flux density inside the central hole is found to be about twice as large in the <b>median</b> <b>plane</b> than on the surface.
