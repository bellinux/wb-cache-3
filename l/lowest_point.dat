5|$|Capital {{punishment}} is legal in Singapore. The number of judicial executions has fluctuated widely depending on crime rates; {{at its highest}} point, according to unofficial statistics compiled by Amnesty International, about 408 people were hanged between 1991 and 2003; at its <b>lowest</b> <b>point</b> in 2010, none were executed. Between 2004 and 2011, the number of executions varied between none and 10. Hanging, which is used for all executions and are carried out in Changi Prison on Fridays at dawn, are by the long drop method, which severs the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|Lawrie McMenemy {{was brought}} in as manager in 1985, but Sunderland reached the <b>lowest</b> <b>point</b> in their history in 1987, when they {{suffered}} relegation to the Third Division after losing a two-leg play-off to Gillingham. The return of 1973 FA Cup winning manager Bob Stokoe, appointed caretaker manager following the sacking of McMenemy, could not help Sunderland avoid relegation. It {{was the first time}} in their history that they had fallen into the Third Division. However, under new manager Denis Smith, promotion was gained at the first attempt; Sunderland returned to the Second Division as Third Division champions in 1988.|$|E

5|$|The city {{generally}} slopes {{from the}} highest point in the Northeast to the <b>lowest</b> <b>point</b> in the Southwest towards the Missouri River. Prominent tributaries of the river are Perche Creek, Hinkson Creek, and Flat Branch Creek. Along these and other creeks in the area can be found large valleys, cliffs, and cave systems such as that in Rock Bridge State Park {{just south of the}} city. These creeks are largely responsible for numerous stream valleys giving Columbia hilly terrain similar to the Ozarks while also having prairie flatland typical of northern Missouri. Columbia also operates several greenbelts with trails and parks throughout town.|$|E

5|$|The libertines {{continued}} organizing opposition, insulting {{the appointed}} ministers, and challenging {{the authority of}} the Consistory. The council straddled both sides of the conflict, alternately admonishing and upholding Calvin. When Perrin was elected first syndic in February 1552, Calvin's authority appeared to be at its <b>lowest</b> <b>point.</b> After some losses before the council, Calvin believed he was defeated; on 24 July 1553 he asked the council to allow him to resign. Although the libertines controlled the council, his request was refused. The opposition realised that they could curb Calvin's authority, but they did not have enough power to banish him.|$|E
5|$|Although the UN {{casualties}} were moderate during the battle, the Third Battle of Seoul {{was a significant}} success for the Chinese military in Korea, and the UN forces' morale had sunk to its <b>lowest</b> <b>point</b> during the war. Ridgway was also extremely displeased {{with the performance of}} Eighth Army, which he had no control over due to the sudden death of Walker. Ridgway then took immediate steps to restore the morale and fighting spirit of the UN forces in Korea. With Ridgway leading the Eighth Army, MacArthur started to regain confidence in UN forces' ability to hold Korea, and the UN evacuation plan was abandoned on January 17.|$|E
5|$|Badami, also {{referred}} to as Vatapi, Vatapipura, Vatapinagari and Agastya Tirtha in historical texts, the capital of Chalukya dynasty in the 6th century, is at the exit point of a ravine between two steep mountain cliffs. Four cave temples in the escarpment of the hill to the south-east of the town were carved into the cliff's monolithic stone face. The escarpment is above a man made lake called Agastya Lake, created by an earthen dam faced with stone steps. To the west end of this cliff, at its <b>lowest</b> <b>point,</b> is the first cave temple. The largest and highest cave is Cave 3, which is further to the east on the northern face of the hill. The fourth cave, Cave 4, is a few steps down further east.|$|E

5|$|Cores {{are often}} drilled {{in areas such}} as Antarctica and central Greenland where the {{temperature}} is almost never warm enough to cause melting, but the summer sun can still alter the snow. In polar areas, the sun is visible day and night during the local summer and invisible all winter. It can make some snow sublimate, leaving the top inch or so less dense. When the sun approaches its <b>lowest</b> <b>point</b> in the sky, the temperature drops and hoar frost forms on the top layer. Buried under the snow of following years, the coarse-grained hoar frost compresses into lighter layers than the winter snow. As a result, alternating bands of lighter and darker ice can be seen in an ice core.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th and 17th centuries, horses moved {{continually}} between Spain and Portugal, {{and horses}} from the studs of Andalusia {{were used to}} improve the Portuguese cavalry. Portugal's successful restoration war against Spain (1640–1668) was in part based on mounted troops riding war horses of Spanish blood. During the reign of Philip III of Portugal (also Philip IV of Spain), Portuguese horse breeding reached its <b>lowest</b> <b>point.</b> The Spanish passed laws to halt the country's production of cavalry horses, and what stud farms did exist were run in secrecy with horses smuggled or stolen from Spain. These secret farms, however, provided the base for the modern Lusitano. In 1662, when Charles II of England married Catherine of Braganza of Portugal, the royal dowry included Portugal's Tangier and Bombay garrisons. These garrisons included large groups of Portuguese cavalry, mounted on Iberian horses.|$|E
5|$|In Bulgaria, the {{two decades}} {{following}} the end of the rebellion marked the <b>lowest</b> <b>point</b> of decline of the Second Empire. The reigns of George Terter I (r. 1280–1292) and his successor Smilets (r. 1292–1298) were characterised with constant Mongol interference in the state's domestic affairs and progressive disintegration of Imperial authority in favour of the feudal magnates. Bulgaria had lost almost all lands to the south of the Balkan mountains to the Byzantines and was in no position to regain these regions. The fortunes of the country changed for the better under George Terter I's son, Theordore Svetoslav (r. 1300–1321), when Bulgaria acquired Bessarabia from the Mongols and reconquered Northern Thrace from the Byzantines, bringing stability and prosperity.|$|E

5|$|In summer 1548, the galleys {{returned}} to Scotland to scout for English ships. Knox's health was now at its <b>lowest</b> <b>point</b> {{due to the}} severity of his confinement. He was ill with a fever {{and others on the}} ship were afraid for his life. Even in this state, Knox recalled, his mind remained sharp and he comforted his fellow prisoners with hopes of release. While the ships were lying offshore between St Andrews and Dundee, the spires of the parish church where he preached appeared in view. James Balfour, a fellow prisoner, asked Knox whether he recognised the landmark. He replied that he knew it well, recognising the steeple of the place where he first preached and he declared that he would not die until he had preached there again.|$|E
5|$|Michigan won the 1901 game, 21–0, at Ohio Field in Columbus, Ohio, {{in front}} of a crowd of {{approximately}} 4,000 persons. A special train carried 375 Michigan students to the game on the Ann Arbor and Hocking Valley railroads. Ohio State held the Wolverines to their <b>lowest</b> <b>point</b> total of the 1901 season. Prior to the game, the head coaches argued over the length of the game, Yost insisting on regulation halves of 30 minute and Ohio State's John B. Eckstorm insisting that the first half be limited to 25 minutes. When the umpire threatened Ohio State with a forfeiture, coach Eckstrom agreed to play regulation halves of 30 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, the Sun's December {{solstice}} position (in {{the northern}} hemisphere, the <b>lowest</b> <b>point</b> on its annual path; {{in the southern}} hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of Sagittarius, one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the Milky Way. Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and the Milky Way, appear (from {{the surface of the}} Earth) to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10° and 20° wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it. In 2012 it was about halfway through the Milky Way, crossing the galactic equator. In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.|$|E
