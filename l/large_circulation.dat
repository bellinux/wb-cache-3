5|$|The {{depression}} {{retained a}} <b>large</b> <b>circulation</b> during its formative stages, {{as indicated by}} both satellite observations and data from rawinsondes. As its cloud pattern continued to coalesce, the NHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Gert at 0900UTC on September15. After tracking west-northwestward, {{the center of the}} storm moved ashore near Bluefields, Nicaragua, around 1800UTC that day, with winds of 40mph (65km/h). Its interaction with land impeded further development, and Gert weakened back to a tropical depression six hours later. Despite the center being inland for nearly two days, parts of the <b>large</b> <b>circulation</b> stayed over the adjacent Caribbean and Pacific waters. This allowed Gert to remain a tropical cyclone while trekking northwestward through Nicaragua and Honduras, defying the NHC's repeated forecasts of its dissipation over land.|$|E
5|$|The typhoon {{produced}} {{heavy rainfall}} early in its lifetime while passing near Guam, including {{a total of}} 23.1 cm (9.09 in) at Andersen Air Force Base. The outer rainbands of the <b>large</b> <b>circulation</b> of Tip produced moderate rainfall in the mountainous regions of the Philippine island of Luzon.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 19, accompanied with spiral bands of convection around an area of low pressure. A <b>large</b> <b>circulation</b> quickly developed once it reached the Atlantic Ocean, and the system organized into Tropical Depression Four late on August 19 while located 345mi (555km) southeast of Cape Verde. Initial forecasts predicted for great intensification, including one forecast for the depression to strengthen to a hurricane within three days. However, the depression remained disorganized, and slowly intensified to attain tropical storm status on August 22.|$|E

5|$|On September 19, Tropical Storm Isabel {{passed through}} southwestern Pennsylvania, though its <b>large</b> <b>circulation</b> {{produced}} tropical storm force winds {{throughout much of}} the state. The passage of Hurricane Isabel resulted in $160million in damage (2003USD, $187million 2008USD) and two indirect deaths in Pennsylvania. One person suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning, believed to be caused due to improperly ventilated generators in an area affected by the power outages. Moderate winds left about 1.4million customers without power across the state as a result of trees falling into power lines, with dozens of houses and cars damaged by the trees.|$|E
5|$|The area of low {{pressure}} preceding {{the development of}} Bertha produced rough surf and rip currents along the Florida coastline. In Perdido Key State Recreation Area, two children were swimming in an unguarded area when they swept away by the currents. Their grandfather attempted to rescue them, but drowned in the rough waters. Another family rescued the two children. The <b>large</b> <b>circulation</b> of Bertha produced light rainfall across Florida, with Pensacola and Destin reporting 2.75inches. Extreme southern portions of Alabama received over 3inches (75mm) of rain from the storm, while western Dauphin Island reported over 5inches (125mm).|$|E
5|$|Though Igor's closest {{approach}} to the contiguous United States only brought it within 600mi (970km) of land, its <b>large</b> <b>circulation</b> produced significant swells along the entire East Coast. High surf advisories were issued in Long Island, New York as waves of 6 to 10ft (1.8 to 3.0m) affected the area. Rip currents in Florida pulled two people out to sea who were later rescued. One person drowned in Surf City, North Carolina after being overwhelmed by rough surf. Along the New Jersey coastline, waves averaging between 6 and 9ft (1.8 and 2.7m) and dangerous rip currents were reported.|$|E

5|$|Although Gert's center {{remained}} off {{the coast}} of Costa Rica, its <b>large</b> <b>circulation</b> produced brisk winds and heavy rainfall across the country. A local weather station recorded 13.1inches (332mm) of rain during the storm. Geologically, the hardest-hit regions consisted of sedimentary layers with poor hydraulic conductivity and were therefore prone to soil saturation. The initial rainfall raised the levels of many rivers, exacerbating the flood threat. The imminent overflow of the Tempisque River prompted wide-scale evacuations, though the river crested gradually without major consequence. After hours of prolonged rainfall, many Pacific regions such as Quepos, Pérez Zeledón, and Osa experienced flooding and landslides, which inflicted moderate damage to roads and bridges.|$|E
5|$|Around 2100UTC on September20, Gert made a final {{landfall}} at {{peak intensity}} {{on the coast}} of Mexico, just north of Tuxpan, Veracruz. The hurricane accelerated and weakened rapidly over the mountainous region of the Sierra Madre Oriental, diminishing to a tropical depression by September21. Despite the degeneration, the <b>large</b> <b>circulation</b> remained intact as it crossed the country. Gert exited the coast of Nayarit and entered the Pacific Ocean later that day, where the NHC reclassified it as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E. The remaining deep convection waxed and waned in intensity; satellite observations indicated the depression could have briefly been a tropical storm on September22. It continued a west to west-northwestward motion for two days, though low-level flow steered it toward the southwest after the convection diminished. There was no redevelopment due to cool sea temperatures, and the system dissipated at sea on September26.|$|E
5|$|On September 19, Tropical Storm Isabel {{passed through}} extreme western Maryland, though its <b>large</b> <b>circulation</b> {{produced}} tropical storm force winds throughout the state. About 1.24million people lost power throughout the state. The worst of its effects came from its storm surge, which inundated areas {{along the coast}} and resulted in severe beach erosion. On the Eastern Shore, hundreds of buildings were damaged or destroyed, primarily in Queen Anne's County from tidal flooding. Thousands of houses were affected in Central Maryland, with severe storm surge flooding reported in Baltimore and Annapolis. Washington, D.C., sustained moderate damage, primarily from the winds. Throughout Maryland and Washington, damage totaled about $945million (2003USD, ($ USD), with only one fatality due to flooding.|$|E

5|$|On the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Hurricane Isabel {{produced}} a storm surge peaking at 8feet (2.4m) on the Chesapeake Bay in Hoopers Island and 6.5feet (2m) on the Atlantic coast in Ocean City. The {{track of the}} hurricane to the west funneled into the bay and was so strong it negated the normal tide cycle in the bay. Tolchester Beach recorded a record-breaking high tide of 7.91feet (2.4m) above mean low water. Rainfall in the Maryland portion of the Delmarva Peninsula reached 3.2inches (81mm) in Steeles Neck. The <b>large</b> <b>circulation</b> of the hurricane produced strong winds across the area, including maximum sustained winds of 52mph (84km/h) and a gust of 66mph (106km/h) in Cambridge.|$|E
5|$|September 17, 2003- Hurricane Isabel {{passes to}} the {{southwest}} of the state as it makes landfall on North Carolina. In the days preceding its landfall, Isabel produces strong waves, and upon striking land, the storm causes a 5-foot (1.5m) storm surge along the Delaware coast. The waves and surge result in beach erosion and overwash. The outer rainbands of Isabel drop around 1inch (25mm) of rain, though the storm's <b>large</b> <b>circulation</b> produces strong wind gusts of up to 70mph (112km/h). The wind gusts knock down many trees and power lines, causing {{one of the worst}} power outages for Conectiv Energy. Damage totals to $17.8million (2003USD, $20.9million 2008USD). Due to the damage, President Bush declares the entire state a disaster area.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} Tropical Storm Nicholas {{can be traced}} to a {{tropical}} wave that moved off the coast of Africa on October 9. It moved westward, and developed a broad area of low pressure along the wave on October 10. Convection organized around the low early on October 12 while located 800miles (1300km) southwest of the Cape Verde islands. As upper level winds became more favorable, the system became better organized, though the circulation center initially remained located {{to the west of the}} area of heavy showers. The surface circulation of the <b>large</b> <b>circulation</b> envelope moved towards a position near the western edge of the deepest convection, and it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Nineteen late on October 13 while located 1,030miles (1,660km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands.|$|E
