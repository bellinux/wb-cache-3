5|$|The {{planetary}} {{model of}} the atom had two significant shortcomings. The first is that, unlike planets orbiting a sun, electrons are charged particles. An accelerating electric charge is known to emit electromagnetic waves according to the <b>Larmor</b> formula in classical electromagnetism. An orbiting charge should steadily lose energy and spiral toward the nucleus, colliding with it in {{a small fraction of}} a second. The second problem was that the planetary model could not explain the highly peaked emission and absorption spectra of atoms that were observed.|$|E

William Thomson, or Lord Kelvin, is the person whom the absolute temperature unit, the kelvin, is named after. Sir Joseph <b>Larmor,</b> a physicist and mathematician, made innovations in the understanding of electricity, dynamics, thermodynamics and the electron theory of matter.

25|$|Physically, an {{accelerating}} charge emits radiation (according to the <b>Larmor</b> formula), {{which carries}} momentum {{away from the}} charge. Since momentum is conserved, the charge is pushed in the direction opposite {{the direction of the}} emitted radiation.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{electromagnetic}} {{fields in the}} neighbourhood of a "point charge" in arbitrary motion and thereby determine the Poynting flux across a spherical surface of vanishingly small radius surrounding the charge. We show that the radiative power losses from a point charge {{turn out to be}} proportional to the scalar product of the instantaneous velocity and the first time-derivative of the acceleration of the charge. This may seem to be in discordance with the familiar <b>Larmor's</b> formula where the instantaneous power radiated from a charge is proportional to the square of acceleration. However, it seems that the root cause of the discrepancy actually lies in the <b>Larmor's</b> formula which is derived using the acceleration fields but without a due consideration for the Poynting flux associated with the velocity-dependent self-fields "co-moving" with the charge. Further, while deriving <b>Larmor's</b> formula one equates the Poynting flux through a surface at some later time to the radiation loss by the enclosed charge at the retarded time. Poynting's theorem, on the other hand, relates the outgoing radiation flux from a closed surface to the rate of energy decrease within the enclosed volume, all calculated for the same given instant only. Here we explicitly show the absence of any Poynting flux in the neighbourhood of an instantly stationary point charge, implying no radiative losses from such a charge, which is in complete conformity with energy conservation. We further show how <b>Larmor's</b> formula is still able to serve our purpose in vast majority of cases. It is further shown that <b>Larmor's</b> formula in general violates momentum conservation {{and in the case of}} synchrotron radiation leads to a potentially wrong conclusion about the pitch angle changes of the radiating charges, and that only the radiation reaction formula yields a correct result, consistent with the special relativity.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{familiar}} <b>Larmor's</b> formula or its relativistic generalization, Liénard's formula, widely believed to represent the instantaneous radiative losses from an accelerated charge, are not compatible with the special theory of relativity (STR). We demonstrate this {{in the case of}} a charge emitting synchrotron radiation where the agency responsible for acceleration (the magnetic field) does no work and thus all the energy-momentum carried by the radiation has to be balanced unambiguously against the kinetic energy-momentum of the moving charge. The application of the radiation reaction inferred from Larmor's/Liénard's formulas in two different inertial frames, yields results that are not in conformity with the relativistic transformations. Further, we show that energy-momentum conservation is violated in all inertial frames when we try to balance the energy-momentum carried by the electromagnetic radiation against the loss of kinetic energy and momentum of the radiating charge in accordance with <b>Larmor's</b> formula. We point out a mathematical subtlety in the applicability of Poynting's theorem, that seems to have been overlooked in the text-book derivation of <b>Larmor's</b> formula, where a proper distinction between "real" and "retarded" times was not kept, and which has therefore given rise to such anomalies, including the mysterious Schott term, which happens to be nothing but the difference in rate of change of energy in self-fields of the charge between retarded and present times.

25|$|It had {{previously}} been proposed, by George FitzGerald in 1889 and by Lorentz in 1892, independently of each other, that the Michelson-Morley result could be accounted for if moving bodies were contracted {{in the direction of}} their motion. Some of the paper's core equations, the Lorentz transforms, had been published by Joseph <b>Larmor</b> (1897, 1900), Hendrik Lorentz (1895, 1899, 1904) and Henri Poincaré (1905), in a development of Lorentz's 1904 paper.

Henri Poincaré gave a physical interpretation to local time (to first order in v/c, the relative velocity of the two reference frames normalized to the speed of light) as the consequence of clock synchronization, under the assumption that the speed of light is constant in moving frames. <b>Larmor</b> is credited to have been the first to understand the crucial time dilation property inherent in his equations.|$|E

40|$|We {{compare the}} {{behavior}} of a charged particle in a gravitational field and empty space. We resolve the apparent conflict between the Lorentz-Dirac equation and <b>Larmor's</b> formula of radiation by noting that the former describes an electron that is itself accelerated by an electromagnetic field. If instead, a hypothetical particle is considered that is accelerated by a non-electromagnetic force, <b>Larmor's</b> formula is found to be consistent with the accelerating particle's equation of motion. We consider the consequences concerning the equivalence principle and find that it is indeed violated if one demands that the same electromagnetic field be present in both the gravitational and accelerating cases; however, if one allows for the external electromagnetic fields to be different, the validity of the equivalence principle is restored. In either case, the basic idea behind the equivalence principle, which leads to a geometrized theory of gravity, remains unaffected. Comment: 3 page...|$|R
40|$|<b>Larmor's</b> theorem {{holds for}} {{magnetic}} {{systems that are}} invariant under spin rotation. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling this invariance is lost and <b>Larmor's</b> theorem is broken: for systems of interacting electrons, this {{gives rise to a}} subtle interplay between the spin-orbit coupling acting on individual single-particle states and Coulomb many-body effects. We consider a quasi-two-dimensional, partially spin-polarized electron gas in a semiconductor quantum well in the presence of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. Using a linear-response approach based on time-dependent density-functional theory, we calculate the dispersions of spin-flip waves. We obtain analytic results for small wave vectors and up to second order in the Rashba and Dresselhaus coupling strengths α and β. Comparison with experimental data from inelastic light scattering allows us to extract α and β as well as the spin-wave stiffness very accurately. We find significant deviations from the local density approximation for spin-dependent electron systems. Comment: 11 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{well-known}} disparity in classical electrodynamics between the power losses calculated from the radiation reaction and that from <b>Larmor's</b> formula, is succinctly understood when a proper distinction is made between quantities {{expressed in terms of}} a "real time" and those expressed in terms of a retarded time. It is explicitly shown that an accelerated charge, taken to be a sphere of vanishingly small radius r_ o, experiences at any time a self-force proportional to the acceleration it had at a time r_ o /c earlier, while the rate of work done on the charge is obtained by a scalar product of the self-force with the instantaneous (present) value of its velocity. Now if the retarded value of acceleration is expressed in terms of the present values of acceleration, then we get the rate of work done according to the radiation reaction equation, however if we instead express the present value of velocity in terms of its time-retarded value, then we get back the familiar <b>Larmor's</b> radiation formula. From this simple relation between the two we show that they differ because <b>Larmor's</b> formula, in contrast with the radiation reaction, is written not in terms of the real-time values of quantities specifying the charge motion but is instead expressed in terms of the time-retarded values. Moreover, it is explicitly {{shown that the}} difference in the two formulas for radiative power loss exactly matches the difference in the temporal rate of the change of energy in the self-fields between the retarded and real times. From this it becomes obvious that the ad hoc introduction of an acceleration-dependent energy term, usually referred to in the prevalent literature as Schott-term, {{in order to make the}} two formulas comply with each other, is redundant.

Pegram was intimately involved in its design, insisting on a structure without load bearing internal walls, so that it could be reconfigured over time, and with large two-storey lecture theatres.

25|$|In the 19th century, luminiferous aether (or ether), meaning light-bearing aether, was a theorized {{medium for}} the {{propagation}} of light (electromagnetic radiation). However, a series of increasingly complex experiments had been {{carried out in the}} late 1800s like the Michelson-Morley experiment in an attempt to detect the motion of Earth through the aether, and had failed to do so. A range of proposed aether-dragging theories could explain the null result but these were more complex, and tended to use arbitrary-looking coefficients and physical assumptions. Joseph <b>Larmor</b> discussed the aether in terms of a moving magnetic field caused by the acceleration of electrons.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{experiments}} by Ernest Rutherford established that atoms {{consisted of a}} diffuse cloud of negatively charged electrons surrounding a small, dense, positively charged nucleus. Given this experimental data, Rutherford naturally considered a planetary-model atom, the Rutherford model of 1911 – electrons orbiting a solar nucleus – however, said planetary-model atom has a technical difficulty. The laws of classical mechanics (i.e. the <b>Larmor</b> formula), predict that the electron will release electromagnetic radiation while orbiting a nucleus. Because the electron would lose energy, it would rapidly spiral inwards, collapsing into the nucleus on a timescale of around 16 picoseconds. This atom model is disastrous, because it predicts that all atoms are unstable.|$|E

25|$|Aneutronic fusion loses much of {{its energy}} as light. This energy results from the {{acceleration}} and deceleration of charged particles.

The radiation can be estimated using the <b>Larmor</b> formula and comes in the X-ray, IR, UV and visible spectrum. Some of the energy radiated as X-rays may be converted directly to electricity. Because of the photoelectric effect, X-rays passing through an array of conducting foils transfer some of their energy to electrons, which can then be captured electrostatically. Since X-rays can go through far greater material thickness than electrons, many hundreds or thousands of layers are needed to absorb the X-rays.|$|E
25|$|Many physicists—including Woldemar Voigt, George FitzGerald, Joseph <b>Larmor,</b> and Hendrik Lorentz himself—had been {{discussing}} the physics implied by these equations since 1887. Early in 1889, Oliver Heaviside had shown from Maxwell's equations that the electric field surrounding a spherical distribution of charge should cease to have spherical symmetry once {{the charge is}} in motion relative to the aether. FitzGerald then conjectured that Heaviside’s distortion result might be applied to a theory of intermolecular forces. Some months later, FitzGerald published the conjecture that bodies in motion are being contracted, in order to explain the baffling outcome of the 1887 aether-wind experiment of Michelson and Morley. In 1892, Lorentz independently presented the same idea in a more detailed manner, which was subsequently called FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction hypothesis. Their explanation was widely known before 1905.|$|E
40|$|In {{synchrotron}} radiation {{there is a}} paradox {{whether or not the}} pitch angle of a radiating charge varies. The conventional wisdom is that the pitch angle does not change during the radiation process. The argument is based on <b>Larmor's</b> radiation formula, where in a synchrotron case the radiation power is along the instantaneous direction of motion of the charge. Then the momentum loss will also be parallel to that direction and therefore the pitch angle of the charge would remain unaffected. The accordingly derived formulas for energy losses of synchrotron electrons in radio galaxies are the standard text-book material for the last 50 years. However, if we use the momentum transformation laws from special relativity, then we find that the pitch angle of a radiating charge varies. While the velocity component parallel to the magnetic field remains unaffected, the perpendicular component does reduce in magnitude due to radiative losses, implying a change in the pitch angle. This apparent paradox is resolved when effects on the charge motion are calculated not from <b>Larmor's</b> formula but from Lorentz's radiation reaction formula. We derive the exact formulation by taking into account the change of the pitch angle due to radiative losses. From this we first time derive the characteristic decay time of synchrotron electrons over which they turn from highly relativistic into mildly relativistic ones.
