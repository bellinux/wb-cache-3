25|$|DOF is {{determined}} by subject magnification at the film / sensor plane and the selected <b>lens</b> <b>aperture</b> or f-number. For a given f-number, increasing the magnification, either by moving closer to the subject or using a lens of greater focal length, decreases the DOF; decreasing magnification increases DOF. For a given subject magnification, increasing the f-number (decreasing the aperture diameter) increases the DOF; decreasing f-number decreases DOF.|$|E
25|$|The {{required}} {{exposure time}} {{depended on the}} lighting conditions, {{the sensitivity of the}} photographic plate, and the camera <b>lens</b> <b>aperture</b> used. In a letter to Leo Tolstoy requesting a portrait sitting, Prokudin-Gorsky described the exposure as taking one to three seconds, but later, when recollecting his time with Tolstoy, he described a six-second exposure on a sunny day. Blaise Agüera y Arcas studied one landscape view, photographed in broad daylight but showing a clear, well-defined moon, and used the moon's movement to estimate that the whole procedure of three filtered exposures and two repositionings of the camera's plate holder had taken over a minute. The <b>lens</b> <b>aperture</b> Prokudin-Gorsky chose to use greatly affected the exposure time required. A small aperture is often used for landscape photography because it allows objects at various distances to all be sharply imaged at the same time, while the use of a large aperture is common for portraiture and plainly evident in the Tolstoy portrait. All other factors being equal, if for example a 16-second exposure was required when using a 1/4-inch-diameter aperture, an exposure of only 1 second would suffice with a 1-inch aperture.|$|E
25|$|Colour apodization is a {{technique}} combining a modified lens design with image processing to achieve an increased depth of field. The lens is modified such that each colour channel has a different <b>lens</b> <b>aperture.</b> For example, the red channel may be f/2.4, green may be f/2.4, whilst the blue channel may be f/5.6. Therefore, the blue channel will have a greater depth of field than the other colours. The image processing identifies blurred regions in the red and green channels and in these regions copies the sharper edge data from the blue channel. The result is an image that combines the best features from the different f-numbers, (Kay 2011).|$|E
5000|$|Contemporary {{photographic}} convention denotes <b>lens</b> <b>apertures</b> with a slash, such as 22 or 64, {{but in its}} writings {{the group}} always used a dot or period instead (as in [...] "f.64").|$|R

50|$|The first Minolta 16 {{camera was}} the 16 Automat (1955), which was almost {{identical}} to the Konan 16 Automat. It featured a fixed-focus 25mm <b>lens,</b> <b>apertures</b> from f/3.5 to f/11, and shutter speeds from 1/50 to 1/200 plus bulb. Film advance was via a Minox-style push-pull housing.|$|R
25|$|For a given subject framing {{and camera}} position, the DOF is {{controlled}} by the <b>lens</b> <b>aperture</b> diameter, which is usually specified as the f-number, the ratio of lens focal length to aperture diameter. Reducing the aperture diameter (increasing the f-number) increases the DOF because the circle of confusion is shrunk directly and indirectly by reducing the light hitting the outside of the lens which is focused to a different point than light hitting the inside of the lens due to spherical aberration caused by the construction of the lens; however, it also reduces the amount of light transmitted, and increases diffraction, placing a practical limit {{on the extent to which}} DOF can be increased by reducing the aperture diameter.|$|E
25|$|If {{the camera}} {{position}} and image framing (i.e., angle of view) have been chosen, {{the only means}} of controlling DOF is the <b>lens</b> <b>aperture.</b> Most DOF formulas imply that any arbitrary DOF can be achieved by using a sufficiently large f-number. Because of diffraction, however, this isn't really true. Once a lens is stopped down to where most aberrations are well corrected, stopping down further will decrease sharpness in the plane of focus. At the DOF limits, however, further stopping down decreases the size of the defocus blur spot, and the overall sharpness may still increase. Eventually, the defocus blur spot becomes negligibly small, and further stopping down serves only to decrease sharpness even at DOF limits (Gibson 1975, 64). There is thus a tradeoff between sharpness in the POF and sharpness at the DOF limits. But the sharpness in the POF is always greater than that at the DOF limits; if the blur at the DOF limits is imperceptible, the blur in the POF is imperceptible as well.|$|E

25|$|Most SLR cameras provide {{automatic}} aperture control, {{which allows}} viewing and metering at the <b>lens's</b> maximum <b>aperture,</b> but stops the lens {{down to the}} working aperture during exposure, and returns the <b>lens</b> to maximum <b>aperture</b> afterward.|$|R
5000|$|Like the [...] "crippled" [...] KAF mount used on {{previous}} Pentax digital SLRs, the [...] "crippled" [...] KAF2 lacks the mechanism to mechanically sense a <b>lens's</b> <b>aperture</b> ring setting. For that reason, {{when using the}} manual aperture ring on K-mount lenses, {{it is necessary to}} set the 'Use aperture ring' setting in the 'Custom Menu' to 'Permitted' and use stop-down metering mode (Pentax calls it optical preview) to ensure proper exposure. KA and KAF <b>lenses</b> with <b>aperture</b> rings are fully compatible when the aperture ring is set to automatic ('A'), giving control over the aperture to the camera body.|$|R
50|$|The KA-mount {{is derived}} from the {{original}} K-mount. It allows the <b>lens's</b> <b>aperture</b> to be set by the body, and thus permits shutter priority and program auto exposure modes. It was introduced in 1983, and is supported by A-series and P-series bodies; Pentax lenses that support it are marked 'SMC Pentax-A'. It is completely backward-compatible with the original K-mount.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>lens</b> <b>aperture</b> {{is usually}} {{specified}} as an f-number, {{the ratio of}} focal length to effective aperture diameter. A lens typically has a set of marked [...] "f-stops" [...] that the f-number can be set to. A lower f-number denotes a greater aperture opening which allows more light to reach the film or image sensor. The photography term [...] "one f-stop" [...] refers to a factor of √2 (approx. 1.41) change in f-number, which in turn corresponds to a factor of 2 change in light intensity.|$|E
2500|$|... where θ is {{the angular}} resolution, λ is the {{wavelength}} of the light, and D is {{the diameter of the}} <b>lens</b> <b>aperture.</b> If the angular separation of the two points is significantly less than the Airy disk angular radius, then the two points cannot be resolved in the image, but if their angular separation is much greater than this, distinct images of the two points are formed and they can therefore be resolved. Rayleigh defined the somewhat arbitrary [...] "Rayleigh criterion" [...] that two points whose angular separation is equal to the Airy disk radius (measured to first null, that is, to the first place where no light is seen) can be considered to be resolved. It can be seen that the greater the diameter of the lens or its aperture, the finer the resolution. Interferometry, with its ability to mimic extremely large baseline apertures, allows for the greatest angular resolution possible.|$|E
2500|$|For some lenses, {{including}} a few long telephotos, lenses mounted on bellows, and perspective-control and tilt/shift lenses, the mechanical linkage was impractical, and automatic aperture control was not provided. [...] Many such lenses incorporated a feature {{known as a}} [...] "preset" [...] aperture, which allows the lens to be set to working aperture and then quickly switched between working aperture and full aperture without looking at the aperture control. A typical operation might be to establish rough composition, set the working aperture for metering, return to full aperture for a final check of focus and composition, and focusing, and finally, return to working aperture just before exposure. Although slightly easier than stopped-down metering, operation is less convenient than automatic operation. Preset aperture controls have taken several forms; the most common has been the use of essentially two <b>lens</b> <b>aperture</b> rings, with one ring setting the aperture and the other serving as a limit stop when switching to working aperture. [...] Examples of lenses {{with this type of}} preset aperture control are the Nikon PC Nikkor 28mm 3.5 and the SMC Pentax Shift 6×7 75mm 4.5. [...] The Nikon PC Micro-Nikkor 85mm 2.8D lens incorporates a mechanical pushbutton that sets working aperture when pressed and restores full aperture when pressed a second time.|$|E
