5|$|After metamorphosis, {{young adults}} may {{disperse}} into terrestrial habitats or {{continue to live}} in water. Almost all frog species are carnivorous as adults, preying on invertebrates, including arthropods, worms, snails, and slugs. A few of the larger ones may eat other frogs, small mammals, and fish. Some frogs use their sticky tongues to catch fast-moving prey, while others push food into their mouths with their hands. A few species also eat plant matter; the tree frog Xenohyla truncata is partly herbivorous, its diet including a large proportion of fruit, Leptodactylus mystaceus has been found to eat plants, and folivory occurs in Euphlyctis hexadactylus, with plants constituting 79.5% of its diet by volume. Adult frogs are themselves attacked by many predators. The northern <b>leopard</b> <b>frog</b> (Rana pipiens) is eaten by herons, hawks, fish, large salamanders, snakes, raccoons, skunks, mink, bullfrogs, and other animals.|$|E

5|$|Only four {{species of}} {{reptiles}} are {{documented in the}} park: three species of snakes which are the wandering garter snake, the less commonly seen valley garter snake and rubber boa, {{as well as one}} lizard species, the northern sagebrush lizard, that was first reported in 1992. None of the species are venomous. Six amphibian species have been documented including the Columbia spotted frog, boreal chorus frog, tiger salamander and the increasingly rare boreal toad and northern <b>leopard</b> <b>frog.</b> A sixth amphibian species, the bullfrog, was introduced. An estimated 10,000 insect species frequent the park; they pollinate plants, provide a food source for birds, fish, mammals and other animals, and help in the decomposition of wood. In one example of the importance of insects to the ecosystem, swarms of Army cutworm moths die in huge numbers after mating and provide a high fat and protein diet for bears and other predators. One study concluded that when this moth species is most available, bears consume 40,000 moths per day which is roughly 20,000kcal/day.|$|E
5|$|Slow-motion {{photography}} {{shows that}} the muscles have passive flexibility. They are first stretched while the frog {{is still in the}} crouched position, then they are contracted before being stretched again to launch the frog into the air. The fore legs are folded against the chest and the hind legs remain in the extended, streamlined position {{for the duration of the}} jump. In some extremely capable jumpers, such as the Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) and the northern <b>leopard</b> <b>frog</b> (Rana pipiens), the peak power exerted during a jump can exceed that which the muscle is theoretically capable of producing. When the muscles contract, the energy is first transferred into the stretched tendon which is wrapped around the ankle bone. Then the muscles stretch again at the same time as the tendon releases its energy like a catapult to produce a powerful acceleration beyond the limits of muscle-powered acceleration. A similar mechanism has been documented in locusts and grasshoppers.|$|E

40|$|Avenues for and {{constraints}} on the transmission of frog lung flukes to frog definitive hosts were studied through examination of the role and fate of parasite metacercariae stages. This study was based on four species of North American frog lung flukes, Haematoloechus coloradensis (Cort, 1915), H. complexus (Seely, 1906), H. longiplexus Stafford, 1902 and H. parviplexus Stafford, 1902. Semi-terrestrial <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs</b> are commonly infected with Haematoloechus coloradensis and H. complexus but exhibit ecological host specificity and are rarely infected with H. parviplexus and H. longiplexus. The latter two lung flukes infect aquatic bullfrogs. Field and experimental infection data indicated that <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs</b> became infected with H. coloradensis and H. complexus by feeding on small non-odonate arthropods that served as second intermediate hosts for these parasites. Comparative experimental examinations of metacercarial survival patterns and distribution in second intermediate odonate hosts revealed that most metacercariae of H. longiplexus were lost during dragonfly metamorphosis, but most metacercariae of H. coloradensis, H. complexus, and H. parviplexus survived dragonfly metamorphosis. These observations suggest that the ecological host specificity of H. longiplexus in semi-terrestrial <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs</b> is due to few metacercariae of H. longiplexus reaching these frogs in a terrestrial environment. Experimental infections of <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs</b> and bullfrogs with H. parviplexus indicate that <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs</b> are resistant to infection with this species. This result indicates that the synonymy of worms from <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs</b> and bullfrogs is not warranted and species from <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs</b> and bullfrogs are distinct. A phylogenetic study of 12 species of North American and European frog lung flukes was conducted using the internal transcribed spacer region. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that these different lineages shared similar patterns of arthropod host specificity distinct from patterns found in the other lineages. These results suggest that second intermediate host specificity may be a trait that has been conserved through evolutionary time. The phylogenetic data presented in this study reveal the importance of second intermediate host specificity among the evolutionary lineages of frog lung flukes because second intermediate hosts serve as avenues for {{and constraints}} on the movement of these parasites to their respective definitive amphibian hosts. ...|$|R

40|$|Metacercariae {{survival}} {{patterns and}} their distribution in second intermediate odonate hosts were examined for four species of frog lung flukes. Surveys of aquatic larvae and recently emerged teneral dragonflies and damselflies indicated that prevalence and mean abundance of Haematoloechus spp. metacercariae {{were significantly lower}} in teneral dragonflies than larval dragonflies, while {{there was no significant}} difference in prevalence or mean abundance of Haematoloechus spp. metacercariae among larval and teneral damselflies. Experimental infections of dragonflies indicated that metacercariae of Haematoloechus coloradensis and Haematoloechus complexus were located in the head, thorax, and branchial basket of dragonflies, whereas metacercariae of Haematoloechus longiplexus and Haematoloechus parviplexus were restricted to the branchial basket of these hosts. Metacercariae of H. coloradensis, H. complexus, and H. longiplexus infected the head, thorax, and abdomen of damselflies, but these insects were resistant to infection with H. parviplexus. Subsequent metamorphosis experiments on experimentally infected dragonflies indicated that most metacercariae of H. longiplexus were lost from the branchial basket during metamorphosis, but most metacercariae of H. coloradensis, H. complexus, and H. parviplexus survived dragonfly metamorphosis. These observations suggest that the observed ecological host specificity of H. longiplexus in semiterrestrial <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs</b> may be due to few metacercariae of H. longiplexus reaching these frogs in a terrestrial environment. Because of the uncertain validity of Haematoloechus varioplexus as a distinct species from its synonym H. parviplexus, their morphological characters were reevaluated. The morphological data on H. varioplexus and H. parviplexus indicate that they differ in their acetabulum length and width, ovary shape, testes length, and egg length and width. Experimental infections of plains <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs,</b> northern <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs,</b> and bullfrogs with worms from bullfrogs indicate that the synonymy of H. parviplexus with H. varioplexus is not warranted, and that these flukes are distinct species, i. e., H. parviplexus in bullfrogs and H. varioplexus in plains <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs</b> and northern <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{quantify}} elimination kinetics of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in adult green frogs (Rana clamitans) and <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs</b> (Rana pipiens). Three experiments were conducted: PCB elimination rate constants were determined for both frog species, and PAH elimination rate constants were determined for <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs</b> only. In green frogs, significant PCB elimination rate constants ranged from 0. 013 to 0. 04 d- 1 (time for frogs to achieve 90 % steady state with water [t 90] = 57. 8 - 178. 2 d). In <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs,</b> significant PCB elimination rate constants ranged from 0. 004 to 0. 047 d- 1 (t 90 = 48. 8 - 657. 9 d). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon elimination in <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs</b> was faster than PCB elimination in either frog species: Significant PAH rate constants ranged from 0. 069 to 0. 188 d- 1 (t 90 = 12. 2 - 33. 5 d). In both species, and for both PCBs and PAHs, a significant inverse relationship was found between the chemical elimination rate constant and Kow. These results show that adult anurans have relatively low elimination rates of PCBs but exhibit a small capacity for metabolic biotransformation of PAHs that is comparable to that of invertebrates but lower than that of fish. These findings suggest that adult amphibians have the potential to be used as biomonitors for persistent organic chemicals. © 2006 SETAC...|$|R
40|$|Studies on {{the life}} cycles and {{epizootiology}} of North American frog lung flukes indicate that most species utilize odonates as second intermediate hosts; adult frogs become infected by ingesting odonate intermediate hosts. Newly metamorphosed frogs are rarely infected with these parasites, predominantly because they are gape-limited predators that cannot feed on large intermediate hosts such as dragonflies. We examined {{the role of the}} frog diet and potential intermediate hosts in the recruitment of the frog lung fluke, Haematoloechus coloradensis, to metamorphosed northern <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs</b> (Rana pipiens), Woodhouse’s toads (Bufo woodhousii), and bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) from western Nebraska. Because of the uncertain validity of H. coloradensis as a distinct species from Haematoloechus complexus, morphological characters of both species were reevaluated and the life cycles of both species were completed in the laboratory. The morphological data on H. coloradensis and H. complexus indicate that they differ in their oral sucker to pharynx ratio, uterine loop distribution, and placement of vitelline follicles. However, in terms of their life cycles, both species are quite similar in their use of physid snails as first intermediate hosts, a wide range of nonodonate and odonate arthropods as second intermediate hosts, and <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs</b> and toads as definitive hosts. These results indicate that H. coloradensis and H. complexus are generalists at the second intermediate host level and might be able to infect newly metamorphosed <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs</b> and toads by using small nonodonate arthropods more commonly than other frog lung fluke species. Comparisons of population structure of adult flukes in newly metamorphosed <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs</b> indicate that the generalist nature of H. coloradensis metacercariae enables it to colonize young of the year <b>leopard</b> <b>frogs</b> more commonly than other Haematoloechus spp. that only use odonates as second intermediate hosts. In this respect, the generalist nature of H. coloradensis and H. complexus at the second intermediate host level is an avenue for the colonization of young of year frogs...|$|R
