5|$|The Hunyadi {{family was}} one of the most {{powerful}} noble families in the Kingdom of Hungary during the 15thcentury. A member of the family, Matthias Corvinus, was King of Hungary from 1458 until 1490, King of Bohemia (ruling in Moravia, Lower <b>Lusatia,</b> Upper <b>Lusatia,</b> and Silesia) from 1469 until 1490, and Duke of Austria from 1487 until 1490. His illegitimate son, John Corvinus, ruled the Duchy of Troppau from 1485 until 1501, and five further Silesian duchies, including Bytom, Głubczyce, Loslau, Racibórz, and Tost, from 1485 until 1490. The Hunyadi coat-of-arms depicted a raven with a golden ring in its beak.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations {{between the}} envoys of Matthias and Vladislaus Jagiellon {{accelerated}} {{during the next}} few months. The first draft of a treaty was agreed upon on 28 March 1478, and the text was completed by the end of 1477. The treaty authorized both monarchs to use the title of King of Bohemiaalthough Vladislaus could omit to style Matthias as such in their correspondenceand the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were divided between them; Vladislaus ruled in Bohemia proper and Matthias in Moravia, Silesia and <b>Lusatia.</b> They solemnly ratified the peace treaty at their meeting in Olomouc on 21 July.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example of}} his {{leadership}} and his coup d'œil, {{the ability to see}} at a glance what needed to be done, occurred after the Battle of Kolin. The loss at Kolin forced the King to lift the siege at Prague. The King's brother, Augustus William, took command of the army and ordered the retreat from Prague. Seydlitz was attached to the advanced corps of Karl Christoph von Schmettau in a brigade of ten squadrons. As Seydlitz's wing entered <b>Lusatia,</b> near the town of Zittau, the Austrians were present in force, and Seydlitz with his squadrons were trapped in the town. Tricking the Austrians into thinking his troop was a foraging party, his cavalry burst on the Austrian cavalry before they could climb into their saddles. Seydlitz led his cavalry in an escape, in close column, and was quickly out of sight.|$|E

5|$|Rupert {{was born}} in Prague in 1619, {{at the start of}} the Thirty Years' War, to Frederick V, Elector Palatine, and Elizabeth Stuart, and was {{declared}} a prince by the principality of <b>Lusatia.</b> He was given his name in honour of King Rupert of Germany, a famous Wittelsbach ancestor. Rupert's father was a leading member of the Holy Roman Empire and the head of the Protestant Union, with a martial family tradition stretching back several centuries. Rupert's family was at the heart of a network of Protestant rulers across the north of Europe, as Frederick had close ties through his mother to the ruling House of Orange-Nassau in the United Provinces, and Elizabeth was the daughter of James I of England and Anne of Denmark. The family lived an extremely wealthy lifestyle in Heidelberg, enjoying the palace gardens—the Hortus Palatinus, designed by Inigo Jones and Salomon de Caus—and a lavish castle with one of the best libraries in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The Czech Catholics, {{who were}} led by Zdeněk of Šternberk, joined forces with Matthias in February 1469. Their united troops were encircled at Vilémov by George of Poděbrady's army. In fear of being captured, Matthias opened {{negotiations}} with his former father-in-law. They met in a nearby hovel, where Matthias persuaded George of Poděbrady to sign an armistice promising that he would mediate a reconciliation between the moderate Hussites and the Holy See. Their next meeting took place in Olomouc in April. Here the papal legates came forward with demands including {{the appointment of a}} Catholic Archbishop to the See of Prague, which could not be accepted by George of Poděbrady. The Czech Catholic Estates elected Matthias King of Bohemia in Olomouc on 3 May but he was never crowned. Moravia, Silesia and <b>Lusatia</b> soon accepted his rule but Bohemia proper remained faithful to George of Poděbrady. The Estates of Bohemia even acknowledged the right of Vladislaus Jagiello, the eldest son of Casimir IV of Poland, to succeed king George of Poděbrady.|$|E
5|$|In {{the upper}} Vistula basin, where the Przeworsk culture {{settlements}} were still relatively dense {{in the first}} half of the 5th century, they are markedly absent during the second half of it. This is also the case in Silesia - the depopulation pattern began there earlier and the latest finds are dated around 400 AD. All of it agrees well with the information given by Procopius of Caesarea, according to whom the Heruli returning to Scandinavia from the Carpathian Basin in 512, heading towards the Varni tribe area in Germany, crossed a large region devoid of human settlements - presumably Silesia and <b>Lusatia.</b> Likewise there are no settlements found in Masovia and Podlasie beyond the early part of the 5th century. On the other hand, in central Poland and Greater Poland isolated remnants from the Roman era cultures continue to be located through the end of 5th and even into the earlier parts of the 6th century. Still further north, in Pomerania, such findings are actually quite numerous, including many cult coin deposit sites (Roman and then Byzantine golden solidi). That's where the Germanic groups lasted the longest (and kept up trade and other contacts with their brethren elsewhere).|$|E

50|$|The circle was {{dominated}} by the electorate of Saxony (the circle's director) and the electorate of Brandenburg. It further comprised the Saxon Ernestine duchies and Pomerania. The <b>Lusatias</b> that fell to Saxony by the 1635 Peace of Prague were never encircled.|$|R
5|$|The two-century {{attempt to}} recover the Holy Land ended in failure. Following the First Crusade there were six major Crusades and {{numerous}} less significant ones. After the last Catholic outposts fell in 1291 {{there were no more}} Crusades but the gains were longer lasting in Northern and Western Europe. The Wendish Crusade and those of the Archbishop of Bremen brought all the North-East Baltic and the tribes of Mecklenburg and <b>Lusatia</b> under Catholic control in the late 12th-century. In the early 13th century the Teutonic Order created a Crusader state in Prussia and the French monarchy used the Albigensian Crusade to extend the kingdom to the Mediterranean Sea. The rise of the Ottoman Empire in the late 14th-century prompted a Catholic response which led to further defeats at Nicopolis in 1396 and Varna in 1444. Catholic Europe was in chaos and the final pivot of Christian–Islamic relations was marked by two seismic events: the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 and a final conclusive victory for the Spanish over the Moors with the conquest of Granada in 1492. The idea of Crusading continued, not least {{in the form of the}} Knights Hospitaller, until the end of the 18th-century but the focus of Western European interest moved to the New World.|$|E
25|$|Between 1376 and 1635 <b>Lusatia</b> {{was part}} of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown, under the rule of the Luxembourgs, Habsburgs and other kings. From the {{beginning}} of the 16th century the whole Sorbian-inhabited area, with the exception of <b>Lusatia,</b> underwent Germanization. In 1635 <b>Lusatia</b> became a fiefdom of Saxon electors. The Thirty Years' War and the plague of the 17th century caused terrible devastation in <b>Lusatia.</b> This led to further German colonization and Germanization.|$|E
25|$|Upper Sorbian (a Slavic language) {{is still}} {{actively}} spoken in {{the parts of}} Upper <b>Lusatia</b> that are inhabited by the Sorbian minority. The Germans in Upper <b>Lusatia</b> speak distinct dialects of their own (Lusatian dialects).|$|E

Schweinitz later entered the Theological seminary at Niesky (Prussia) in 1798. In 1805, he published the Conspectus Fungorum in <b>Lusatiae</b> in collaboration with his teacher, Professor J.B.

5000|$|Gaussig House is a {{manor house}} in Palladian style {{located in the}} {{district}} Bautzen in the German state of Saxony approximately 6 km southwest from the Upper Lusatian central city Bautzen. Extending over some 75 acre, nestled in beautiful natural surroundings and bordered by the Grosse Picho hill to the south, lies one of Upper <b>Lusatia’s</b> largest landscape parks. Gaussig House, the orangery, the church and vicarage, and the estate form the centre of Gaussig village.|$|R
50|$|In 1518, the lordship was pawned to the Order of Saint John {{and turned}} Protestant in 1540. Under {{the rule of}} Lord Master Count Adam of Schwarzenberg, the fortifications were enlarged, {{nevertheless}} Friedland suffered severely under {{the impact of the}} Thirty Years' War. Upon the 1635 Peace of Prague, it passed with the <b>Lusatias</b> to the Electorate of Saxony. Under Master Prince John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen the lordship quickly recovered. Town privileges were confirmed in 1662, a Jewish community is documented since 1673.|$|R
25|$|The Congress of Vienna, in 1815, gave part of Upper <b>Lusatia</b> to Saxony, {{but most}} of <b>Lusatia</b> to Prussia. More and more bans {{on the use of}} Sorbian {{languages}} appeared from then until 1835 in Saxony and Prussia; emigration of the Sorbs, mainly to the town of Serbin in Texas and to Australia, increased. In 1848, 5000 Sorbs signed a petition to the Saxon Government, in which they demanded equality for the Sorbian language with the German one in churches, courts, schools and Government departments. From 1871 the whole of <b>Lusatia</b> became a part of united Germany and was divided between two parts; Prussia (Silesia and Brandenburg), and Saxony.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{movement}} in Lower <b>Lusatia</b> was {{organized around the}} most prominent Lower Lusatian poets Mato Kósyk (Mato Kosyk) and Bogumił Šwjela.|$|E
25|$|Historically, Silesia was bounded to {{the west}} by the Kwisa and Bóbr Rivers, while the {{territory}} west of the Kwisa was in Upper <b>Lusatia</b> (earlier Milsko). However, because part of Upper <b>Lusatia</b> {{was included in the}} Province of Silesia in 1815, in Germany Görlitz, Niederschlesischer Oberlausitzkreis and neighbouring areas are considered parts of historical Silesia. Those districts, along with Poland's Lower Silesian Voivodeship and parts of Lubusz Voivodeship, make up the geographic region of Lower Silesia.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} border of Lower Silesia is mapped by the mountain ridge of the Western and Central Sudetes, which since the High Middle Ages formed {{the border between}} Polish Silesia and the historic Bohemian region of the present-day Czech Republic. The Bóbr and Kwisa rivers are considered being the original western border with the <b>Lusatias,</b> however the Silesian Duchy of Żagań reached up to the Neisse river, including two villages (Pechern and Neudorf) on the western shore, which became Silesian in 1413.|$|R
50|$|The Lands of the Bohemian Crown, {{often called}} Czech lands in modern times, {{were a number}} of {{incorporated}} states in Central Europe during the medieval and early modern periods connected by feudal relations under the joint rule of the Bohemian kings. The crown lands primarily consisted of the Kingdom of Bohemia, an electorate of the Holy Roman Empire according to the Golden Bull of 1356, the Margraviate of Moravia, the Duchies of Silesia, and the <b>Lusatias,</b> as well as other territories throughout its history.|$|R
50|$|During the Thirty Years' War, the <b>Lusatias</b> again {{passed to}} the Wettin electors of Saxony by the 1635 Peace of Prague. Golßen Castle was built about 1723, it {{passed to the}} Counts of Solms-Baruth in the 19th century. Surrounded by {{extended}} gardens, parts of the buildings were refurbished in a Neoclassical style by Eduard Knoblauch in 1852. The neighbouring estates of Zützen were held by the Kleist noble family. A Baroque palace in Zützen, erected according to plans designed by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, burnt down completey in the late days of World War II.|$|R
25|$|South of the Hevelli {{lived the}} {{ancestors}} of the modern Sorbs, the Lusici of Lower <b>Lusatia</b> and the Milceni of Upper <b>Lusatia.</b> Near these tribes were the Selpoli and the Besunzanen. The Colodici, Siusler, Nisanen and Glomaci (Daleminzier) lived along the upper Elbe, while the Chutici, Plisni, Gera, Puonzowa, Tucharin, Weta, and groups of Nelětici lived near the Saale. On the middle Oder lived the Leubuzzi, who were associated with medieval Poland. Small groups of West Slavs also lived on the Main and the Regnitz near Bamberg and in northeastern Bavaria.|$|E
25|$|In 1007 Henry {{denounced the}} Peace of Poznań, which caused Bolesław's {{attack on the}} Archbishopric of Magdeburg {{as well as the}} re-occupation of the marches of <b>Lusatia,</b> through he stopped short of retaking Meissen. The German counter-offensive began three years later, in 1010, but it was of no {{significant}} consequence. In 1012, a five-year peace was signed. Bolesław broke the peace, however, and once again invaded <b>Lusatia.</b> Bolesław's forces pillaged and burned the city of Lubusz (Lebus). In 1013, a peace accord was signed at Merseburg. As part of the treaty, Bolesław paid homage to Henry II for the March of <b>Lusatia</b> (including the town of Bautzen) and Sorbian Meissen as fiefs. A marriage of Bolesław's son Mieszko with Richeza of Lotharingia, daughter of the Count Palatine Ezzo of Lotharingia and granddaughter of Emperor Otto II was also performed. During the brief period of peace on the western frontier that followed, Bolesław took part in a short campaign in the east, towards the Kievan Rus' territories.|$|E
25|$|Bolesław I {{had taken}} control of the marches of <b>Lusatia</b> (Łużyce), Sorbian Meissen (Miśnia), and the cities of Budziszyn (Bautzen) and Meissen in 1002, and refused to pay the tribute to the Empire from the conquered territories. Bolesław, after the Polish-German War (1002–1018), signed the Peace of Bautzen on 30 January 1018, which made Bolesław I a clear winner. The Polish ruler {{was able to keep}} the contested marches of <b>Lusatia</b> and Sorbian Meissennot as fiefs, but as part of Polish territory. The Polish prince Mieszko {{destroyed}} a 100 Sorbian villages in 1030 and expelled them from urban areas, exception made of fisherman and carpenters, who were allowed to live in the outskirts.|$|E
50|$|Vladislas II of the Jagiellon dynasty, {{son of the}} Polish king Casimir IV, was {{designated}} King of Bohemia in 1471, while the crown lands of Moravia, Silesia, and the <b>Lusatias</b> were occupied by rivaling King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary. In 1479 both kings signed the Treaty of Olomouc, whereby {{the unity of the}} Bohemian crown lands was officially retained unchanged and the monarchs appointed each other as sole heir. Upon the death of King Matthias in 1490, Vladislas ruled the Bohemian crown lands and the Kingdom of Hungary in personal union.|$|R
5000|$|The first [...] "Piasts", {{probably}} of Polan descent, appeared around 940 in {{the territory}} of Greater Poland at the stronghold of Giecz. Shortly afterwards they relocated their residence to Gniezno, where Prince Mieszko I ruled over the Civitas Schinesghe from about 960. The name Polani, from Slavic: pole ("field"), did not appear until 1015. The Piasts temporarily also ruled over Pomerania, Bohemia and the <b>Lusatias,</b> as well as Ruthenia, and the Hungarian Spiš region in present-day Slovakia. The ruler bore {{the title of a}} duke or a king, depending on their position of power.|$|R
50|$|According to the 1635 Peace of Prague, the <b>Lusatias</b> {{passed from}} the Bohemian Crown to the Electorate of Saxony. Several witch-hunts are {{documented}} in the 17th century. In 1707 a fire destroyed {{large parts of the}} old town. In 1896 Kamenz became garrison town of the Königlich Sächsisches Reserve-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 242, part of the German 53rd Reserve Division. In World War II a subcamp of Gross-Rosen concentration camp was located in the town from 1944 to 1945, where forced labourers worked for a Daimler-Benz aircraft engine factory. The airfield northeast of the town was used by Luftwaffe Schlachtgeschwader 2 and Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 units.|$|R
