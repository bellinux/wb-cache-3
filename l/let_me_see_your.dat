2500|$|Until the {{beginning}} of the 20th century in the Pirot District, south-eastern Serbia, the head of household would go out to his woodpile, where he would invite German (pronounced [...] ) – a male mythological being associated with bringing rain and hail. He would take with him a loaf of bread called good luck, prepared particularly for this ritual, rakia, wine, and a wax candle. At the woodpile, he would shout three times, [...] "German, German, wherever you are, come to dinner right now, and in the summer do not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> eyes anywhere!" [...] He would then light the candle, take a sip of rakia, taste some bread, drink wine, and go back into his house. Asked what happened with German, he would answer, [...] "He came, so we dined and drank amply of rakia and wine, and then we parted." [...] This ritual was intended to prevent summer hailstorms.|$|E

6000|$|... "Saving {{you from}} your--no, I cannot call it folly,--I would hardly have had you stand still to see such--but <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, very well! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> all <b>your</b> books, then," [...] said Maggie, {{turning to}} throw her arms round Tom's neck, and rub his cheek with her small round nose.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{that depends}} upon circumstances," [...] said the Captain, who wasn't {{going to be}} posed; [...] "but <b>let</b> <b>me</b> jist <b>see</b> <b>your</b> book you've been reading these things out of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{wish you}} happiness, {{because you have}} found it," [...] he said. [...] "Wise and {{wonderful}} people! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> if <b>your</b> coffee is what I should expect, Nora," [...] he went on. [...] "To tell you the truth, I have had rather a disturbed breakfast." ...|$|R
60|$|MILLIKEN.--Hold your scurrilous tongues sir! My good nature ruins {{everybody}} about me. Make up your accounts. Pack your trunks--and never <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> face again.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, since you've {{dropped the}} spindle down, you must just go after it yourself, and don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> face again until {{you bring it}} with you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{have better}} eyes for that than you had for your horse, then,' said Varden, {{descending}} nimbly from his chaise; 'who are you? <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> face.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then {{he has no}} {{business}} to do it,' said Mr. Gradgrind. 'Tell him he mustn't. Cecilia Jupe. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see.</b> What is <b>your</b> father?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will {{as soon as}} I {{know what}} I am to scold about. Unburden yourself, child, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> all <b>your</b> iniquity, for if you begin by being jealous of Mac and Phebe, I'm {{prepared}} for anything," [...] said Dr. Alec, leaning back as if nothing could surprise him now.|$|R
6000|$|... "And you dared! you--a savage--a slave--the basest {{thing in}} the world of vermin! Take care! I don't value your {{worthless}} life more than I do that of a rat or a spider. Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> ever <b>see</b> <b>your</b> hideous face here again, or I shall rid the earth of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go at once then, in Heaven's name!" [...] said she, {{her eyes}} {{flashing}} at his, though never meeting them. [...] "Don't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> face any more." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sir ANTHONY Nay, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> taste.--[Pulls {{his coat}} open, the sword falls.] Trinkets!--a bauble for Lydia!--Zounds! sirrah, {{you are not}} going to cut her throat, are you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I know my piece,’ quoth Nance. ‘Come, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> silver, Mr. Archer. If I {{have to get}} it by a theft I’ll {{see that}} money,’ she cried.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And if Mr. Steerforth {{ever comes}} into Norfolk or Suffolk, Mr. Peggotty,' I said, 'while I am there, you may depend upon it I shall {{bring him to}} Yarmouth, if he will <b>let</b> <b>me,</b> to <b>see</b> <b>your</b> house. You never saw such a good house, Steerforth. It's made out of a boat!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That, indeed! Yes, and {{it would}} help your memory, too, wouldn't it, barber? Yours, on your side, being a little weak, too, I dare say. Ah, barber! how ingenious we human beings are; and how kindly we {{reciprocate}} each other's little delicacies, don't we? What better proof, now, that we are kind, considerate fellows, with responsive fellow-feelings--eh, barber? But to business. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see.</b> What's <b>your</b> name, barber?" ...|$|R
60|$|Alib. In all debates you plainly <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> You love <b>your</b> virtue best, but Odmar me: Go, your mistaken piety pursue: I'll {{have from}} him what is denied by you; With my {{commands}} you shall no more be graced. Remember, sir, this trial was your last.|$|R
6000|$|... "Adrea! Adrea!" [...] he cried, in a low, {{suppressed}} whisper which {{shook with}} passion. [...] "You here! What has happened? Stand in the light! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> face!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know my piece," [...] quoth Nance. [...] "Come, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> silver, Mr. Archer. If I {{have to get}} it by a theft I'll {{see that}} money," [...] she cried.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oho, you're at it again! Take {{your hands}} away, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> eyes. You always {{do that when}} I read a letter from her. I will write and tell her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, tyrant," [...] {{answered}} the persevering gallant, [...] "I will plague {{you no longer}} now, providing you will <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> you from <b>your</b> window tomorrow, when the sun first peeps over the eastern hills, and give me right to be your Valentine for the year." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, sir, {{you are my}} guest. It is late, and {{my people}} are not available. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> to <b>your</b> comfort myself." [...] He insisted on {{carrying}} my traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang heavily. At {{the end of this}} he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper, and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished, flamed and flared.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I am not; {{but love}} gives insight, Maggie, and insight often gives foreboding. Listen to me,--let me supply you with books; do <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> you sometimes,--be <b>your</b> brother and teacher, {{as you said}} at Lorton. It is less wrong that you should <b>see</b> <b>me</b> than {{that you should be}} {{committing}} this long suicide." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{outrageous}} imp! Not {{another word}} from you. I {{will not have}} you in this place another minute! Go to Mr. Gaston and draw your pay and leave, and never <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> face again!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shouldn't {{it be the}} reverse? You {{deserve the}} thanks for the way you helped me, though I am sorry it was {{necessary}} you should do what you did. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> hands," [...] I said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't he?" [...] {{replied the}} doctor. [...] "Well, step up here, Dick, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> tongue. No, I should be {{surprised}} if he did! the man's tongue is fit to frighten the French. Another fever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very {{good and}} serviceable," [...] he said, [...] "and a really splendid set of horses. Of course, gentlemen, you would look {{better if you}} were in uniform, but for your purpose the clothes you have on are far more useful. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> you in <b>your</b> hats; I can then better judge how you would pass as Boers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless you, sir, {{if any one}} {{is about}} he will be, for he is always the first stirring. But here he is, sir, to answer your {{questions}} for himself. No, sir, no; it is as much as my place is worth to <b>let</b> him <b>see</b> <b>me</b> touch <b>your</b> money. Afterwards, if you like." ...|$|R
6000|$|Holmes {{held it out}} to me. [...] "A soft {{revolver}} bullet, as you perceive, Watson. There's {{genius in}} that, for who would expect to find such a thing fired from an airgun? All right, Mrs. Hudson. I am much obliged for your assistance. And now, Watson, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> you in <b>your</b> old seat once more, for there are several points which I should like to discuss with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [wresting {{knife from}} her] Give it to me, I say. O God, your very hands are wet with blood! This place is Hell, I cannot tarry here. I pray you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> face no more.|$|E
6000|$|Just {{then the}} major's voice broke in again. [...] "A very good fight, Mr. Sewell. I {{scarcely}} think I could have beaten {{you if you}} hadn't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> game. However strong your position is, that is very seldom wise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps not," [...] {{returned}} Montague, on {{whom the}} urbanity and candour of {{the captain of}} the Foam were beginning to have a softening influence. [...] "You have no objection to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> papers, and examine your ship, I suppose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dishonour!" [...] MacDougall said savagely; [...] "the {{girl has}} lost her senses. I {{tell you he}} should die if every woman in Scotland had given her promise for his life. Away with him!" [...] {{he said to his}} retainers; [...] "take him to the chamber {{at the top of the}} tower; I will give him till {{tomorrow}} to prepare for death, for by all the saints I swear he shall hang at daybreak. As to you, girl, go to your chamber, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> not <b>see</b> <b>your</b> face again till this matter is concluded. Methinks a madness must have fallen upon you that you should thus venture to lift your voice for a Forbes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 3. [...] "That Hirsch coming, a {{settlement}} was tried: 'Give me back my Draft on Paris, you objectionable blockhead of a Hirsch; there are your Diamonds, {{there is something}} even for your expenses (some fair moiety, I think); and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> never <b>see</b> <b>your</b> unpleasant face again!' To which Hirsch, examining the diamonds, answered [says Duvernet, not substantially incorrect hitherto, though stepping along in total darkness, and very partial on Voltaire's behalf],--Hirsch, examining the diamonds, answered, 'But you have changed some of them! I cannot take these!'--and drove Voltaire quite to despair, and into the Law-Courts; which imprisoned Hirsch, and made him do justice." [...] [Duvernet (T.J.D.V.), 170, 173, 175:--vague utterly; dateless (tries one date, and is mistaken even in the Year); wrong in nearly every detail; [...] "the 'STAIRE or STEUER was a BANK?"

6000|$|... "Don't look so angry, my dear. I {{know very}} well {{you want to do}} {{everything}} you can for <b>me.</b> <b>Let's</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> doctor, perhaps he can do something for me, and at any rate it'll comfort you." [...] He turned his eyes to Upjohn. [...] "You're a damned fool, Leonard. Why d'you want to worry the boy? He has quite enough to do to put up with me. You'll do nothing more for me than write a pretty article about me after my death. I know you." ...|$|R
