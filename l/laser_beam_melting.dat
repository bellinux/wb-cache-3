In order to overcome these limitations, a hybrid manufacturing methodology is developed combining the additive manufacturing process of <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> <b>melting</b> with sheet forming processes. With an interest towards aerospace and medical industry, the material in focus is Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. Although Ti- 6 Al- 4 V is a commercially established material and its application for LBM process has been extensively investigated, the combination of LBM of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V with sheet metal {{still needs to be}} researched. Process dynamics such as high temperature gradients and thermally induced stresses lead to complex stress states at the interaction zone between the sheet and LBM structure. Within the presented paper mechanical characterization of hybrid parts will be performed by shear testing.
