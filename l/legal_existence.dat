5|$|At {{the time}} British law {{relating}} to marriage {{was based on}} the legal doctrine of coverture, in which a woman's legal rights and obligations were subsumed by those of her husband upon their matrimony. By law a woman had no separate <b>legal</b> <b>existence,</b> and all her property became her husband's; divorce initiated by a woman was difficult and complicated. In April 1868 Josephine and fellow suffragist Elizabeth Wolstenholme set up and became joint secretaries of the Married Women's Property Committee to pressure parliament into changing the law. Josephine remained on the committee until the campaign was successful, with the passing into law of the Married Women's Property Act 1882.|$|E
5|$|Initially, in the KOR's tradition, Solidarity was an ostensibly non-political {{movement}} {{aiming at}} reconstruction of civil society. Suddenly thrust into <b>legal</b> <b>existence</b> and prominence in 1980, Solidarity and the Polish opposition in general lacked a constructive program or consensus regarding further developments. In 1981, Solidarity accepted {{the necessity of}} a political role and helped form a broad anti-ruling system social movement, dominated by the working class and with members ranging from people associated with the Catholic Church to non-communist leftists. The union was backed by intellectual dissidents, including the KOR, and adhered to a policy of nonviolent resistance. According to Karol Modzelewski, the Solidarity of 1980–81 was permeated by the idea of brotherhood between intelligentsia and workers. In the areas of ideology and politics, Solidarity followed the lead of its associated opposition intellectuals.|$|E

25|$|UCL and King's College, whose {{campaign}} for a teaching university in London had resulted in the university's reconstitution as a federal institution, went even further than becoming schools of the university and were actually merged into it. UCL's merger, under the 1905 University College London (Transfer) Act, happened in 1907. The charter of 1836 was surrendered and all of UCL's property became the University of London's. King's College followed in 1910 under the 1908 King's College London (Transfer) Act. This was a slightly more complicated case, as the theological department of the college (founded in 1846) did not merge into the university but maintained a separate <b>legal</b> <b>existence</b> under King's College's 1829 charter.|$|E

The bill was proposed to the Pennsylvania Senate on January 16, 1826 and again faced opposition. Some senators opposed the teaching of military science, believing it would inspire a war-like attitude in the students. After two months of discussion, the charter was approved by the Senate on March 7, 1829. Two days later, Governor of Pennsylvania J.

25|$|It is easy {{today to}} {{underestimate}} {{the extent to which}} the novel challenged existing social and legal structures. May Sinclair, in 1913, said that the slamming of Helen Huntingdon's bedroom door against her husband reverberated throughout Victorian England. Anne's heroine eventually left her husband to protect their young son from his influence. She supported herself and her son by painting while living in hiding, fearful of discovery. In doing so, she violated not only social conventions, but English law. Until 1870, when the Married Women's Property Act was passed, a married woman had no independent <b>legal</b> <b>existence</b> apart from her husband; could not own property, sue for divorce, or control custody of her children. If she attempted to live apart, her husband had the right to reclaim her. If she took their child, she was liable for kidnapping. By living on her own income she was held to be stealing her husband's property, since any property she held or income she made was legally his.|$|E

500|$|Until {{the passing}} of the Marriage Act of 1753, a formal {{ceremony}} of marriage before a clergyman was not a legal requirement in England, and marriages were unregistered. All that was required was for both parties to agree to the union, so long as each had reached the legal age of consent, which was 12for girls and 14for boys. Women were completely subordinated to their husbands after marriage, the husband and wife becoming one legal entity, a legal status known as coverture. As the eminent English judge SirWilliamBlackstone wrote in 1753: [...] "the very being, or <b>legal</b> <b>existence</b> of the woman, is suspended during the marriage, or at least is consolidated and incorporated into that of her husband: under whose wing, protection and cover, she performs everything". Married women could not own property in their own right, and were indeed themselves the property of their husbands.

40|$|One of {{the senses}} of the term ‘efficacy’ refers {{to the fact that}} norm-addresses {{actually}} behave as is required of them by legal norms.

According to legal positivism, efficacy is in some cases and in certain ways the condition of legal validity of both legal norms and legal systems. On the other hand, legal realism tends to entirely identify legal validity or reduce it to efficacy. Thus, in both jurisprudential approaches, efficacy tends {{to play a role in}} shaping their respective concepts of law. However, while the legal positivistic view does not affect the most standard sense of legal validity of the legal norm (i. e. the legal norms’ membership in the legal system), and does not add much to the explanation of the concept of law by identifying efficacy as the criterion of <b>legal</b> systems’ <b>existence,</b> the <b>legal</b> realistic view is faced with some serious objections regarding its explanatory adequacy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} DANIEL, 1 {{an architecture}} for {{the integration of}} case-based reasoning and rule-based reasoning for legal interpretation.

The principal problems of legal interpretation are the lack of deep models for <b>legal</b> reasoning, the <b>existence</b> of inherently ill-defined predicates and the frequent use of opentextured concepts, as pointed out in (Rissland & Skalak 1991). A hybrid approach to representing the legal sources and the use of meta-knowledge seems to be appropriate to solve these problems.
