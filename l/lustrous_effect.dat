Electroless plating and anodized aluminum were rejected because they lacked durability. A physical vapor deposition process involving a nickel-chrome plating was dismissed for not achieving the right color, luster, or warmth.

40|$|The ceramic glazing {{techniques}} of vapour glazing, reduction lustre, Raku and fuming all require specialised firing conditions {{with the use}} of potentially hazardous kiln atmospheres and specialist kiln designs for their successful execution. The technique of reduction lustre is an ancient, highly decorative technique in which pigments or glazes containing reducible metal oxides such as copper, silver and bismuth are subjected to a reducing atmosphere which results in the formation of stable iridescent <b>lustrous</b> colour <b>effects.</b> Conventionally hydrocarbons are used to produce a reducing atmosphere, the combustion of which can lead to potentially high levels of CO. This research has concentrated on the technique of reduction lustre with the aim of producing a safe, environmentally friendly firing system. Reduction lustre effects were reproduced using a 100 litre down draft gas kiln designed and constructed for the purpose. A 40 litre electric kiln was modified for use with reducing atmospheres and a laboratory muffle kiln was also adapted to provide closely controlled firing conditions. Alternative reducing atmospheres were assessed, consisting of either 5 % H 2 in N 2 or hydrocarbon vapour in N 2 The former is reliable, safe, environmentally friendly and is recommended for studio pottery use. A theoretical design for a reduction lustre kiln incorporating a gas control system based on the use of a 5 % H 2 in N 2 gas mixture and a gas tight outer casing was developed. Thermoanalytical methods were used to investigate the reduction behaviour of raw materials, glazes and frits under different atmospheric conditions. Diffusional and topochemical models of reduction reactions occurring in a typical lustre glaze have been evaluated. In-glaze lustres reduce with thecharacteristics of diffusion processes. Water diffusion out of the glaze may be rate determining. Studies carried out using energy dispersive x-ray analysis andphoto electron spectroscopy show that lustres are associated with the presence of metallic copper, the actual colour being dependent on the surface concentration of the metal. The aesthetic results of the various firing methods developed were assessed using a perceptual study based on the use of a semantic differential test developed from a multiple sorting survey carried out using lustred tiles. The survey used both lustred tiles to represent a 2 -dimensional surface and lustred vases which represented a 3 -dimensional lustre glazed surface. The survey showed that statistically significant differences were observed between lustred ceramics fired in different systems, allowing comparisons to be made in an objective manner.
