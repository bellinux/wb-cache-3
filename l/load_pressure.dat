40|$|Although {{a number}} of {{experiments}} have been attempted to investigate the lubrication of aqueous copolymer lubricant, which is applied widely in metalworking operations, a comprehensive theoretical investigation at atomistic level is still lacking. This study addresses the influence of <b>loading</b> <b>pressure</b> and copolymer concentration on the structural properties and tribological performance of aqueous copolymer solution of poly(propylene oxide) -poly(ethylene oxide) -poly(propylene oxide) (PPO-PEO-PPO) at mixed lubrication using a molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. An effective interfacial potential, which has been derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, was employed for the interactions between the fluid 2 ̆ 7 s molecules and iron surface. The simulation results have indicated that the triblock copolymer is physisorption on iron surface. Under confinement by iron surfaces, the copolymer molecules form lamellar structure in aqueous solution and behave differently from its bulk state. The lubrication performance of aqueous copolymer lubricant increases with concentration, but the friction reduction is insignificant at high <b>loading</b> <b>pressure.</b> Additionally, the plastic deformation of asperity is dependent on both copolymer concentration and <b>loading</b> <b>pressure,</b> and the wear behavior shows a linear dependence of friction force {{on the number of}} transferred atoms between contacting asperities...|$|R
50|$|Compared {{to modern}} {{centerfire}} cases {{used in the}} strongest types of modern guns, existing rimfire cartridge designs use loads that generate relatively low pressure because of limitations of feasible gun design — the rim {{has little or no}} lateral support from the gun. Such support would require very close tolerances in design of the chamber, bolt, and firing pin. Because that is not cost-effective, it is necessary to keep rimfire <b>load</b> <b>pressure</b> low enough so that the stress generated by chamber pressure that would push the case rim outward cannot expand the rim significantly. Also, the wall of the folded rim must be thin and ductile enough to easily deform, as necessary to allow the blow from the firing pin to crush and thereby ignite the primer compound, and it must do so without rupturing, If it is too thick, it will be too resistant to deformation. If it is too hard, it will crack rather than deform. These two limitations — that the rim is self-supporting laterally and that the rim is thin and ductile enough to easily crush in response to the firing pin impact — limit rimfire pressures.|$|E
50|$|Rapid tectonic {{loading of}} wet {{sediment}} in accretionary wedges {{is likely to}} cause the fluid pressure to rise until it is sufficient to cause dilatant fracturing. Dewatering of sediment that has been underthrust and accreted beneath the wedge can produce a large steady supply of such highly overpressured fluid. Dilatant fracturing will create escape routes, so the fluid pressure {{is likely to be}} buffered at the value required for the transition between shear and oblique tensile (dilatant) fracture, which is slightly in excess of the <b>load</b> <b>pressure</b> if the maximum compression is nearly horizontal. This in turn buffers the strength of the wedge at the cohesive strength, which is not pressure‐dependent, and will not vary greatly throughout the wedge. Near the wedge front the strength is likely to be that of the cohesion on existing thrust faults in the wedge. The shear resistance on the base of the wedge will also be fairly constant and related to the cohesive strength of the weak sediment layer that acts as the basal detachment. These assumptions allow the application of a simple plastic continuum model, which successfully predicts the observed gently convex taper of accretionary wedges.|$|E
50|$|The hull was {{equipped}} with a torsion bar suspension designed to ensure a vehicle with good cross-country mobility. The hull and suspension recalled both the German Tiger and the Panther tanks which, having entered French service after the war, were well known and deliberately imitated. Especially the engine deck, the sprockets and the tracks are strongly reminiscent of the German design style. The nine overlapping tyred road wheels each side, were however much smaller. The French engineers had not been aware at first that the much admired German overlapping design had been motivated by a shortage of high quality rubber, necessitating large road wheels to lower tyre tension, which then were made overlapping to better distribute the <b>load</b> <b>pressure.</b> As France would have no trouble obtaining rubber of the desired quality, this feature was superfluous. Therefore the road wheels were made smaller, compared to the first design proposal, both to save weight and lower {{the profile of the}} tank, which was quite high due to a deep hull, a problem only changed in the fifth prototype. The track now had to be supported by five top rollers. The overlapping system as such was maintained in all prototypes; with smaller wheels it allowed for nine instead of the originally planned eight wheels, five forming the outer, four the inner row.|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{describes}} the seizure phenomena at welded interface during steel pipe friction welding. The relationship between friction speed and initial torque was clarified, {{and the relationship}} between relative speed and seizure temperature at the welded interface was estimated from the experimental results. The seizure phenomenon of the base metal was clarified by a constant temperature friction test in which he friction surfaces were rubbed together at various temperatures and <b>loaded</b> <b>pressures</b> in an electric furnace. Then, the seizure temperature at the friction surface was obtained by constant temperature friction tests. The experiments produced the following summarized results. (1) The friction torque curve had wear and seizure stages until the initial torque when pipes were welded at low friction speed. The wear stage time decreased with increasing friction speed. The initial torque decreased with increasing friction speed when pipes were welded at the same friction pressure, and increased with increasing friction pressure. (2) The seizure temperature at the welded interface was calculated by using the relationship between the torsional shear strength of base metal at its seizure temperature and the measured initial torque. The seizure temperature for a low relative speed at the welded interface was lower than that for a high relative speed. (3) The maximum friction torque increased with increasing friction temperature at the same <b>loaded</b> <b>pressure,</b> and they increased with increasing <b>loaded</b> <b>pressure</b> at the same friction surface temperature by constant temperature friction tests.

Table  6 displays the DQ gel effect on the core damage as well as the core permeability reduction. The core permeability was determined before and after the PPGs were compressed.

40|$|AbstractWith {{reference}} to the experimental observation of crack initiation and propagation from pre-existing flaws in rock specimens under compression, the influences of pre-existing flaw inclination angle on the cracking processes were analyzed by means of finite element method (FEM) and non-linear dynamics method.
