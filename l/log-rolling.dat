40|$|STUDY DESIGN. : Cadaveric biomechanical study. OBJECTIVE. : To {{quantify}} spinal motion {{created by}} transfer methods from supine to prone {{position in a}} cadaveric C 1 -C 2 global instability model. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. : Patients who have sustained a spinal cord injury remain {{at high risk for}} further secondary injury until their spine is adequately stabilized. To date, no study has evaluated the effect of patient transfer methods from supine to prone position in the operating room, on atlantoaxial cervical spine motion. METHODS. : A global instability was surgically created at the C 1 -C 2 level in 4 fresh cadavers. Two transfer protocols were tested on each cadaver. The <b>log-roll</b> technique entailed performing a standard 180 degrees <b>log-roll</b> rotation of the supine patient from a stretcher to the prone position onto the operating room Jackson table (OSI, Union City, CA). The 2 ̆ 2 Jackson technique 2 ̆ 2 involved sliding the supine patient to the Jackson table, securing them to the table, and then rotating them into a prone position. An electromagnetic tracking device registered motion between the C 1 and C 2 vertebral segments. Three different head holding devices (Mayfield, Prone view, and blue foam pillow) were also compared for their ability to restrict C 1 -C 2 motion. Six motion parameters were tracked. Repeated measures statistical analysis was performed to evaluate angular and translational motion. RESULTS. : For 6 of 6 measures of angulation and translation, manual <b>log-roll</b> prone positioning generated significantly more C 1 -C 2 motion than the Jackson table turning technique. Out of 6 motion parameters, 5 were statistically significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 001 - 0. 005). There was minimal difference in C 1 -C 2 motion generated when comparing all 3 head holding devices. CONCLUSION. : The data demonstrate that manual <b>log-roll</b> technique generated significantly more C 1 -C 2 motion compared to the Jackson table technique. Choice of headrest has a minimal effect on the amount of motion generated during patient transfer, except that the Mayfield device demonstrates a slight trend toward increased C 1 -C 2 motion...|$|R

60|$|One of {{the sources}} of evil in modern large democracies is {{the fact that most of}} the {{electorate}} have no direct or vital interest in most of the questions that arise. Should Welsh children be allowed the use of the Welsh language in schools? Should gipsies be compelled to abandon their nomadic life at the bidding of the education authorities? Should miners have an eight-hour day? Should Christian Scientists be compelled to call in doctors in case of serious illness? These are matters of passionate interest to certain sections of the community, but of very little interest to the great majority. If they are decided according to the wishes of the numerical majority, the intense desires of a minority will be overborne by the very slight and uninformed whims of the indifferent remainder. If the minority are geographically concentrated, so that they can decide elections in a certain number of constituencies, like the Welsh and the miners, they have a good chance of getting their way, by the wholly beneficent process which its enemies describe as <b>log-rolling.</b> But if they are scattered and politically feeble, like the gipsies and the Christian Scientists, they stand a very poor chance against the prejudices of the majority.

40|$|Background: Numerous {{studies have}} shown that there are better {{alternatives}} to log rolling patients with unstable spinal injuries, although this method is still commonly used for placing patients onto a spine board. No previous studies have examined transfer maneuvers involving an injured football player with equipment in place onto a spine board. Purpose: To test 3 different transfer maneuvers of an injured football player onto a spine board to determine which method most effectively minimizes spinal motion in an injured cervical spine model. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Five whole, lightly embalmed cadavers were fitted with shoulder pads and helmets and tested both before and after global instability was surgically created at C 5 -C 6. An electromagnetic motion analysis device was used to assess the amount of angular and linear motion with sensors placed above and below the injured segment during transfer. Spine-boarding techniques evaluated were the log roll, the lift and slide, and the 8 -person lift. Results: The 8 -person lift technique resulted in the least amount of angular and linear motion for all planes tested as compared with the lift-and-slide and <b>log-roll</b> techniques. This reached statistical significance for lateral bending (P. 031) and medial-lateral translation (P. 030) when compared with the <b>log-roll</b> maneuver. The lift-and-slide technique was significantly more effective at reducing motion than the log roll for axial rotation (P. 029) and lateral bending (P. 006). Conclusion: The log roll resulted in the most motion at an unstable cervical injury as compared with the other 2 spine-boardin...|$|R

50|$|The National Collegiate Athletic Association in its {{advice to}} {{athletic}} trainers and team physicians, {{contained in the}} NCAA Sports Medicine Handbook, advises that the helmet should never be removed from an injured athlete, conscious or unconscious, with a suspected or potential head or neck injury during pre-hospital management. In this advice, certain assumptions are made. The first is that the facemask can be removed so that airway care, if needed, can be carried out. The second is that the helmet fits securely so that supporting the helmet will support the athlete's head and neck. The advice accepts that helmet removal may be necessary if an ill-fitting helmet prevents {{the head and neck}} from being secured safely for emergency transport. It is also accepted that helmet removal may be necessary if, for some reason or another, the facemask cannot be removed in a reasonable time. There is general agreement that should helmet removal be required, it should only be carried out by trained personnel. The NCAA also asserts that the injured athlete should be maneuvered to a spine board for transport as a 'single unit' using a lift/slide maneuver or <b>log-roll</b> technique.|$|R
40|$|Context. In {{a patient}} with a {{potential}} cervical spine injury, minimizing or eliminating movement at {{the head and neck}} during stabilization and transport is paramount because movement can exacerbate the condition. Any equipment or technique creating less movement will allow for a more effective and safe stabilization of an injured patient, reducing the likelihood of movement and potential secondary injury. Objective: To compare the amount of head movement created during the <b>log-roll</b> and motorized spine-board (MSB) stabilization techniques. Design: A 2 -condition, repeated-measures design. Setting: Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: Thirteen certified athletic trainers, emergency first responders, and emergency medical technicians (6 men, 7 women). Intervention(s) : Subjects rotated through 4 positions for the log roll and 2 positions for the MSB. Each subject performed 3 trials while maintaining manual, inline stabilization of the model 2 ̆ 7 s head for each condition. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Three-dimensional head movement was measured and expressed as degrees of motion. Results: The log roll created significantly more motion in the frontal and transverse planes compared with the MSB (P =. 001 for both measures). No significant difference was noted for sagittal-plane motion (P =. 028). Conclusions: The MSB created less movement at the head than did the log roll in 2 planes of motion and created slightly more motion in 1 plane, although this difference was not significant. The MSB may provide emergency responders with an appropriate alternative method for stabilizing and transporting a supine injured athlete without requiring a log roll...|$|R
60|$|Greek art at {{its highest}} point is doubtless the most perfect that we know. But its circle of motives was {{essentially}} limited; and the Greek drama in its passion, its pathos, and its humor is primarily Greek, and secondarily human. Its tragedy chooses its actors from certain heroic families, and finds its springs of pity and terror in physical suffering and worldly misfortune. Its best examples, like the Antigone, illustrate a single duty, or, like the Hippolytus, a single passion, on which, as on a pivot, the chief character, statuesquely simple in its details, revolves as pieces of sculpture are sometimes made to do, displaying its different sides in one invariable light. The general impression left on the mind (and this is apt to be a truer one than any drawn from single examples) is that the duty is one which is owed to custom, that the passion leads to a breach of some convention settled by common consent,[201] and accordingly it is an outraged society whose figure looms in the background, rather than an offended God. At most it was one god of many, and meanwhile another might be friendly. In the Greek epic, the gods are partisans, they hold caucuses, they lobby and <b>log-roll</b> for their candidates. The tacit admission of a revealed code of morals wrought a great change. The complexity and range of passion is vastly increased when the offence is at once both crime and sin, a wrong done against order and against conscience at the same time. The relation of the Greek Tragedy to the higher powers is chiefly antagonistic, struggle against an implacable destiny, sublime struggle, and of heroes, but sure of defeat at last. And that defeat is final. Grand figures are those it exhibits to us, in some respects unequalled, and in their severe simplicity they compare with modern poetry as sculpture with painting. Considered merely as works of art, these products of the Greek imagination satisfy our highest conception of form. They suggest inevitably a feeling of perfect completeness, isolation, and independence, of something rounded and finished in itself. The secret of those old shapers died with them; their wand is broken, their book sunk deeper than ever plummet sounded. The type of their work is the Greek Temple, which leaves nothing to hope for in unity and perfection of design, in harmony and subordination of parts, and in entireness of impression. But in this aesthetic completeness it ends. It rests solidly and complacently on the earth, and the mind rests there with it.|$|R

5000|$|A {{letter to}} the editor of The Argus in February 1881 made the {{assertion}} that the market traffic should never have been removed to the Queen Victoria Market and that the decision to do so {{was the result of a}} deep-laid scheme of <b>log-rolling</b> at the expense of the ratepayers. The only redress, they argued, was that the Victoria Market, being now a wholesale market only, shall be strictly prohibited from any retail transactions whatever, and shall be closed punctually at 8am, at which hour all wholesale trade is finished. The editorial response in the same edition suggested that design of the new building was at fault:"What with outside shops and inside stalls, the proper area of the Eastern Market place has been so curtailed that carts cannot be allowed to occupy stands therein. In designing it, the idea was that they would enter, deposit their loads, and then pass out. Market gardeners, however, refused to fall in with this arrangement. They dislike unpacking articles which may be sold for delivery elsewhere, and they refuse to recognise the reasonableness of asking them to employ men and boys to take their carts and horses into the open streets, there to stand exposed to wind, rain, and the elements generally, until business is over. We venture to think that if the Corporation is intent on restoring the Eastern Market site to popularity, it will have to abolish a large number of the interior stalls, and make what provision it can for carts and those who wish to sell from them."However, by April of that year, with no resolution to the issue of the two markets, even The Argus was airing its doubts:"When we call to mind what has been done, the influences which have been, and doubtless are still, at work, and when we find gentlemen intimately acquainted with corporation matters evidently suspicious as to the intentions of those immediately concerned in dealing with the market places, we may be forgiven if we assume that there is something going on that does not meet the public eye." ...|$|E

40|$|Shear is an {{effective}} method to create long-range order in micro- or nanostructured soft materials. When simple shear flow is applied, particles or polymer microdomains tend to align in the shear direction to minimize viscous dissipation; thus, transverse alignment (so-called <b>log-rolling)</b> is not typically favored. This is the first study to report the transverse alignment of cylinder-forming coil&# 8211;coil block copolymers. Poly(styrene-b-methyl methacrylate), PS&# 8211;PMMA, where the PS blocks form the matrix, can adopt a metastable PMMA hemicylindrical structure when confined in a thin film, and this hemicylindrical structure can orient either along the shear direction or transverse to the shear direction depending on the shearing temperature. A monolayer of PS&# 8211;PMMA forming full cylinders exhibits <b>log-rolling</b> alignment. This unusual <b>log-rolling</b> behavior is explained by the low chain mobility of the cylinder-forming PMMA block at low temperatures, which is the critical quantity determining the direction of shear alignment. clos...|$|E

Design Prospective observational study over three years. Setting Single tertiary paediatric intensive care unit in the North West of England. Patients Twenty five children with moderate to severe closed traumatic brain injury and intraparenchymal intracranial pressure monitoring in intensive care (2 - 17 years of age). Interventions Routine nursing care interventions. Measurements and main results ICP measured one minute before the procedure, at the maximal value during the procedure and five minutes after the procedure was recorded for the purpose of this study. Time to recovery was also recorded, in minutes. A total of 25 measurements (the first one in each child) in the first 36 hours of the child's PICU admission were analysed. Both ETSMV and <b>log-rolling</b> were associated with clinically and statistically significant changes in ICP from baseline to maximal ICP (p= 0. 005) and maximal to 5 -minute post ICP (p= 0. 001) for ETSMV and (p 15 mmHg) showed higher maximal ICPs (but not ICP rise), suggesting a linear relationship between baseline and maximal ICP, although this was more pronounced during turning. One third of the children had not returned to their baseline ICP by 5 minutes after ETSMV, compared with 60 % children after <b>log-rolling.</b> Neither eye care nor mouth care showed any clinically significant effects on ICP in these children, suggesting these procedures are not noxious and are tolerated very well. However, there was only a small number of washing episodes reported in this study therefore the observations are not conclusive.
