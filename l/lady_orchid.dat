5000|$|<b>Lady's</b> slipper <b>orchids</b> (also {{known as}} <b>lady</b> slipper <b>orchids</b> or slipper orchids) are orchids in the {{subfamily}} Cypripedioideae, which comprises the genera Cypripedium, Mexipedium, Paphiopedilum, Phragmipedium and Selenipedium. They are characterised by the slipper-shaped pouches (modified labellums) {{of the flowers}} [...] - [...] the pouch traps insects so {{they are forced to}} climb up past the staminode, behind which they collect or deposit pollinia, thus fertilizing the flower.|$|R
5000|$|The blue <b>lady</b> <b>orchid</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1839 by John Lindley in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. The specific epithet (...) is a Latin word meaning [...] "hairy".|$|E

The early purple orchid (Orchis mascula), fly orchid (Ophrys insectifera), lesser butterfly orchid (Platanthera bifolia) and bird's nest orchid (Neottia nidus-avis) {{can be found in}} woodland areas whilst there is also a large population of the rare <b>lady</b> <b>orchid</b> (Orchis purpurea).|$|E

50|$|Because of {{the special}} nature of the chalky soil, there are many rare plants in the area, {{particularly}} several varieties of orchid which are at their best in early summer. In particular, the tall <b>lady</b> <b>orchid</b> (Orchis purpurea) grows under the staircases leading down to the beach. The chalk also provides a distinctive light green tint to the beech trees {{along the top of}} the cliffs, maintaining their spring hues throughout the summer season. In the hilly park which stretches a couple of kilometers inland, there are a number of ponds and marshes, many populated by trees. Several signposted circuits provide opportunities for walkers, riders and cyclists to discover the surroundings.|$|E
50|$|Calcaerous {{woodland}} {{occurs on}} thin soils where chalk {{is close to}} the surface. These conditions are most often found on the escarpment of the North Downs and on valley slopes, but may also occur on the plateau of the dip slope. Calcaerous woodland is typically dominated by beech (Fagus), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), yew (Taxus baccata) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior). Box Hill has one of the largest areas of native box (Buxus sempervirens) woodland in England. One notable species characteristic of calcaerous woodland is the nationally scarce <b>lady</b> <b>orchid</b> (Orchis purpurea) which is found in more than 100 sites on the Kent stretch of the North Downs, but is confined to just two sites elsewhere in the UK.|$|E

50|$|Compared {{with other}} low {{mountain}} regions, the Rhön is particularly rich in plant varieties. Its natural vegetation {{would probably be}} dominated by beech woods with scattered groups of other trees, but today beech trees are very much in decline. A few of these ancient woods were identified as core elements of the Rhön biosphere reserve. The higher beech woods are a habitat for rare, sometimes isolated, species of plant such as the Alpine blue-sow-thistle, giant bellflower and annual honesty. The vegetation of the lower-lying beech woods has a mix of mountain and other varieties. In addition to common wildflowers like the martagon lily, lily of the valley, wild chervil and wild garlic, various orchids also flourish here including Cephalanthera orchids, the yellow coralroot, bird's-nest orchid, lady's slipper and <b>lady</b> <b>orchid.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{dominant}} {{chalk grassland}} community at Park Gate Down is CG4 Brachypodium pinnatum. However, fine, less vigorous grasses are also common such as sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina). The reserve supports a rich flora including many calcicoles such as common milkwort (Polygala vulgaris), small scabious (Scabiosa columbaria) and marjoram (Origanum vulgare). Notable species include slender bedstraw (Galium pumilum), adder's tongue (Ophioglossum), horseshoe Vetch (Hippocrepis comosa) and columbine (Aquilegia vulgaris).Fourteen species of orchid {{are known to}} grow at the reserve {{including some of the}} UK's rarest species. Park Gate Down is one of only three sites in the UK for the nationally rare monkey orchid (Ochis simia). The orchid was introduced to the site during the twentieth century from another Kentish site and has since flourished with over 100 plants. Park Gate Down also supports the nationally rare late spider orchid (Ophrys fuciflora) that in the UK is limited to the North Downs in East Kent as well as the nationally scarce <b>lady</b> <b>orchid</b> (Orchis purpurea) and musk orchid (Herminium monorchis) of which 72 were counted in 2007.|$|E
