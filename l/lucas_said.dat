5|$|Frank Oz voices Yoda, the centuries-old {{leader of}} the Jedi Council who is {{apprehensive}} about allowing Anakin to be trained. Yoda was mostly portrayed as a puppet designed by Nick Dudman based on Stuart Freeborn's original design. Oz controlled the puppet's mouth and other parts were controlled by puppeteers using remote controls. Lucas fitted Yoda's filming around Oz's schedule as he finished and promoted In & Out. A computer-generated Yoda is featured in two distant shots. Warwick Davis portrays him in the scene in which Obi-Wan becomes a Jedi Knight. <b>Lucas</b> <b>said</b> he originally wanted to use a full-time digital Yoda, but the attempts did not work well enough. On the Blu-ray release of The Phantom Menace, which was also used for the 3D reissue, a CG Yoda {{similar to the one}} from the other prequels is used instead.|$|E
25|$|On 2 September, it was {{announced}} that Lucas and Bartley had been elected with 86% of first-preference votes. <b>Lucas</b> <b>said</b> the party would strive to preserve the rights of EU nationals living in Britain, and EU rules on workersâ€™ rights and the environment, among other policies.|$|E
500|$|Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn, a Jedi Master who discovers Anakin {{and insists}} that the boy be trained as a Jedi despite the Jedi Council's protests. Lucas {{originally}} wanted to cast an American actor in the role, but cast Irishman Neeson because he considered that Neeson had great skills and presence. <b>Lucas</b> <b>said</b> Neeson was a [...] "master actor, who the other actors will look up to, who has got the qualities of strength that the character demands".|$|E
50|$|After {{having a}} very {{difficult}} time getting his previous film, Hard Eight, released, Anderson laid down a hard law when getting Boogie Nights made. He initially wanted the film to be over three hours long and be rated NC-17. The film's producers, particularly Michael De <b>Luca,</b> <b>said</b> that the film had to be either under three hours or rated R. Anderson fought with them, saying that the film would not have a mainstream appeal no matter what. They did not change their minds, and Anderson chose the R rating as a challenge. Despite this, the film was still 20 minutes shorter than promised.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lucas</b> has <b>said</b> {{that he is}} a fan of Seth MacFarlane's hit TV show Family Guy. MacFarlane {{has said}} that Lucasfilm was {{extremely}} helpful when the Family Guy crew wanted to parody their works.|$|R
50|$|Italy's Anti-Narcotic Group (NAS) {{began an}} investigation, this {{included}} tapping the phones of Doctor Santuccione and installing {{a hidden camera}} in his office. On March 3, 2004, they recorded a phone call in which Santuccione advised the professional cyclist Danilo Di Luca to inject EPO before Milan-San Remo. Di <b>Luca</b> <b>said</b> that he would visit the Doctor that evening with teammate Alessandro Spezialetti. Later that evening the video surveillance of Santuccione's office showed Santuccione preparing two disposable syringes with EPO and exiting his office to where Di Luca and Spezialetti were waiting outside. A teammate of Di Luca and Spezialetti, Eddy Mazzoleni also sent SMS messages to Santuccione at this time mentioning Di Luca and hormone use.|$|R
500|$|Despite {{worries about}} the film being {{finished}} on time, two weeks before its theatrical release Lucasfilm preponed the release date from May 21 to 19, 1999. At the ShoWest Convention, <b>Lucas</b> <b>said</b> the change was intended to give the fans a [...] "head start" [...] {{by allowing them to}} view it during the week and allowing families to view it during weekends. Foreshadowing his future conversion to digital cinematography, <b>Lucas</b> <b>said</b> the film would be released on four digital projectors on June 18, 1999. Eleven charity premieres were staged across the United States on May 16, 1999; receipts from the Los Angeles event, where corporate packages were available for between [...] and proceeds were donated to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation. Other charity premieres included the Dallas premiere for the Children's Medical Center, the Aubrey Fund for Pediatric Cancer Research at the Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York, the Big Brother/Sister Association of the Philadelphia premiere, and the Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. A statement said that tickets were sold at [...] apiece and that certain sections of the theaters were set aside for disadvantaged children.|$|E
500|$|The Force Unleashed is {{intended}} to make players think they are [...] "actually, finally, in a Star Wars movie". It is the first game on which LucasArts and Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) collaborated since they both relocated to the Letterman Digital Arts Center in San Francisco, California. This collaboration allowed the companies to co-develop tools to make film-quality effects. LucasArts worked with ILM's Zeno tool framework and helped ILM build its Zed game editor. <b>Lucas</b> <b>said</b> having the two companies working {{together in the same}} building was [...] "a great collaboration".|$|E
500|$|Truman {{decided that}} he did not need formal {{authorization}} from Congress, believing that most legislators supported his position; this would come back to haunt him later, when the stalemated conflict was dubbed [...] "Mr. Truman's War" [...] by legislators. However, on July 3, 1950, Truman did give Senate Majority Leader Scott W. Lucas a draft resolution titled [...] "Joint Resolution Expressing Approval of the Action Taken in Korea". <b>Lucas</b> <b>said</b> that Congress supported the use of force, that the formal resolution would pass but was unnecessary, and that the consensus in Congress was to acquiesce. Truman responded {{that he did not}} want [...] "to appear to be trying to get around Congress and use extra-Constitutional powers," [...] and added that it was [...] "up to Congress whether such a resolution should be introduced." ...|$|E
50|$|A digital {{version of}} the Falcon appears briefly on Coruscant in Revenge of the Sith. <b>Lucas</b> has <b>said</b> that the ship is the Falcon and not another ship of similar design. A CGI {{version of the}} vessel also appears in the Disney {{attraction}} Star Tours: The Adventures Continue.|$|R
5000|$|Bill Walton {{was named}} finals MVP and was called [...] "an inspiration" [...] by the {{defeated}} Julius Erving. Maurice <b>Lucas</b> later <b>said</b> of Walton's post-game thrown jersey {{that was sent}} into the rushing crowd of fans, [...] "if I had caught the shirt, I would have eaten it. Bill's my hero." ...|$|R

500|$|In that film, {{the initial}} {{conception}} of Palpatine was superseded by his depiction as a dictatorial ruler adept {{in the dark}} side of the Force. The Emperor was inspired by the villain Ming the Merciless from the Flash Gordon comic books. The rise of Palpatine involving an ambitious and ruthless politician dismantling a democratic republic to achieve supreme power is in part inspired by the real-world examples of Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, Benito Mussolini, and Adolf Hitler. Other elements of the character come from Richard Nixon. <b>Lucas</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "The whole point of the movies, the underlying element that makes the movies work, is that you, whether you go backwards or forwards, you start out in a democracy, and democracy turns into a dictatorship, and then the rebels make it back into a democracy." ...|$|E
500|$|Certain {{elements}} of Klingon culture, {{such as the}} Emperor, and a general influence of Japanese culture with honor at the forefront, were first explored with the script for the two-part [...] "Kitumba". Writer John Meredith <b>Lucas</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "I wanted something that we {{had never seen before}} on the series, and that's a penetration deep into enemy space. I started to think of how the Klingons lived. Obviously for the Romulans we had Romans, and we've had different cultures modeled on those of ancient Earth, but I tried to think of what the Klingon society would be like. The Japanese came to mind, so basically that's what it was, with the Sacred Emperor, the Warlord and so on." [...] While the episode itself was later filmed for the fan production , Star Trek first visited the Klingon homeworld in The Next Generation episode [...] "", and the themes would be revisited through the series.|$|E
500|$|Lucas {{decided to}} make {{elaborate}} costumes because the film's society was more sophisticated than the one depicted in the original trilogy. Designer Trisha Biggar and her team created over 1,000 costumes that were inspired by various cultures. Biggar worked closely with concept designer Iain McCaig to create a color palette for the inhabitants of each world: Tatooine followed A New Hope with sun-bleached sand colors, Coruscant had grays, browns and blacks, and Naboo had green and gold for humans while Gungans wore [...] "a leathery look, like their skin". The Jedi costumes followed the tradition from the original film; Obi-Wan's costume {{was inspired by the}} costume that was worn by Guinness. <b>Lucas</b> <b>said</b> he and Biggar would look at the conceptual art to [...] "translat all of these designs into cloth and fabric and materials that would actually work and not look silly". Biggar also consulted Gillard to ensure the costumes would accommodate action scenes, [...] and consulted the creature department to find which fabrics [...] "wouldn't wear too heavily" [...] on the alien skins. A huge wardrobe department was set up at Leavesden Film Studios to create over 250 costumes for the main actors and 5,000 for the background ones.|$|E
50|$|As a chain smoker, {{she had a}} raspy {{voice that}} gave E.T. his {{trademark}} speech sound. She also had been hired by George Lucas to be the voice of Boushh in the film Return of the Jedi. <b>Lucas</b> had <b>said</b> {{he was in the}} laundromat when he thought her ambiguous voice was perfect.|$|R

6000|$|Ambrose {{folded his}} hands with a gesture of earnestness, and <b>Lucas</b> Hansen <b>said,</b> [...] "Bless thee, my son! Methinks I can aid thee in thy quest, so thou canst lay aside," [...] and here his voice grew sharper and more peremptory, [...] "all thy gentleman's airs and follies, and serve-- ay, serve and obey." ...|$|R
500|$|During the concert, Davis {{directed}} approximately 50 stops or {{breaks to}} the band, particularly the rhythm section, by gesturing {{with his head}} or hand. These stops served as dramatic turning points in the tension-release structure of the performances, changing their tempo and allowing the band to alternate between quiet passages and intense climaxes. He also interjected the performances with drone washes from his Yamaha organ, achieving a [...] "strange, nearly perverse presence" [...] that Mikal Gilmore believed [...] "defined the temper" [...] of the music. <b>Lucas</b> <b>said</b> Davis applied a feel for dynamics he had developed earlier in his career playing jazz but with a greater array of contrasts, including atonal, dissonant chords, and his own bebop trumpet playing set against the group's funk rhythms. [...] "Extreme textures and extreme volume", Lucas explained, [...] "were as much part of the palette as the contrasting chord and rhythmic structures. Being equipped like a full rock band, we sometimes literally blew the walls out." [...] During the [...] "Tatu" [...] and [...] "Agharta Prelude" [...] segments, Davis abruptly stopped and started the septet several times to shift tempos by playing a dissonant, cacophonous organ figure, giving Cosey space to generate eccentric, psychedelic figures and effects. The main theme for [...] "Tatu" [...] had been played at a slower tempo when Cosey first joined the band, but they played it faster as their rapport grew, especially {{by the time of}} the Japanese tour. Cosey credited Davis with having the ability to [...] "transmit thoughts and ideas" [...] to the soloists with his playing.|$|E
2500|$|However, in 2015 <b>Lucas</b> <b>said</b> {{he planned}} to finish Episode VII, release it in May 2015 and then sell the company afterward. But Disney {{expressed}} interest, with Lucas saying [...] "It's better {{for me to get}} out {{at the beginning of a}} new thing and I can just remove myself. The time is more important to me than the money." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, at {{the time}} of the release of The Empire Strikes Back, <b>Lucas</b> <b>said</b> there were seven further Star Wars films he wanted to make. [...] He said he had [...] "twelve-page outlines" [...] for those films. In an {{interview}} with Jim Steranko in Prevue magazine published in late 1980, Lucas described how the expansive scope of Star Wars had started with an overlong screenplay: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{forget my}} {{message to the}} lady who is to sit to me to-morrow," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Luca</b> to Nanina, as she passed him {{on her way out}} of the studio.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me, Rocco," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Luca,</b> {{turning the}} note {{round and round}} perplexedly between his finger and thumb; [...] "do you think Maddalena will be {{lucky enough to get}} married to Fabio?" ...|$|R
25|$|George Lucas's Star Wars films use many {{elements}} of a Western, and <b>Lucas</b> has <b>said</b> he intended for Star Wars to revitalize cinematic mythology, a part the Western once held. The Jedi, who take their name from Jidaigeki, are modeled after samurai, showing the influence of Kurosawa. The character Han Solo dressed like an archetypal gunslinger, and the Mos Eisley Cantina is much like an Old West saloon.|$|R
2500|$|Connery {{turned down}} a cameo {{appearance}} in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008), as he was enjoying retirement too much. In a statement, he provided one last piece of advice for [...] "Junior"â€“ keep the cliffs low, the monsters CGI and the whip close at hand {{to fend off the}} stunt coordinator. George <b>Lucas</b> <b>said</b> in hindsight that it was good Connery did not appear, as it would disappoint the audience when his character did not join the film's adventure. Ford joked, [...] "I'm old enough to play my own father." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chris Taylor {{called the}} Force [...] "largely a mystery" [...] in Star Wars. Taylor ascribes the [...] "more poetic, more spiritual ... and more demonstrative" [...] {{descriptions}} of the Force in The Empire Strikes Back to Lawrence Kasdan, who co-wrote the film, but says the film does little to expand audiences' understanding of it. In 1997, <b>Lucas</b> <b>said</b> that the more detail he articulated about the Force and how it works, the more it took away from its core meaning. According to Rob Weinert-Kendt, the [...] "Force theme" [...] in John Williams' score represents the power and responsibility of wielding the Force.|$|E
2500|$|Lucas {{used the}} term the Force to [...] "echo" [...] its use by cinematographer Roman Kroitor in 21-87 (1963), in which Kroiter says, [...] "Many people feel that in the contemplation of nature and in {{communication}} with other living things, they become aware {{of some kind of}} force, or something, behind this apparent mask which we see in front of us, and they call it God". Although Lucas had Kroitor's line in mind specifically, <b>Lucas</b> <b>said</b> the underlying sentiment is universal and that [...] "similar phrases have been used extensively by many different people for the last 13,000 years".|$|E
6000|$|... "Hunters don't {{go out for}} mere sport," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Lucas</b> Van Dyk, [...] "they {{do it in the}} way of business--for {{ivory and}} hides. Of course they must take the chances of a risky trade." ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Lucas</b> has <b>said</b> {{on various}} {{occasions}} that Sean Connery's portrayal of British secret agent James Bond {{was one of}} the primary inspirations for Jones, a reason Connery was chosen for the role of Indiana's father in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Spielberg earned the rank of Eagle Scout and Ford the Life Scout badge in their youth, which gave them the inspiration to portray Indiana Jones as a Life Scout at age 13 in The Last Crusade.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yea," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Lucas,</b> [...] "so it be, but I am sojourning here to aid {{in bearing}} about the seed of the Gospel, for which I walk through these lands of ours. But tell me of thy brother, and of the little Moorish maiden?" ...|$|R
2500|$|George Lucas {{created the}} concept of the Force to address {{character}} and plot developments in Star Wars (1977). He also wanted to [...] "awaken a certain kind of spirituality" [...] in young audiences, suggesting a belief in God without endorsing any specific religion. He developed the Force as a nondenominational religious concept, [...] "distill the essence of all religions", premised on the existence of God and distinct ideas of good and evil. <b>Lucas</b> <b>said</b> that there is a conscious choice between good and bad, and [...] "the world works better if you're on the good side".|$|E
2500|$|Originally, Lucas {{envisioned the}} planet of Tatooine, {{where much of}} the film would take place, as a jungle planet. Gary Kurtz {{traveled}} to the Philippines to scout locations; however, because of the idea of spending months filming in the jungle would make Lucas [...] "itchy", the director refined his vision and made Tatooine a desert planet instead. Kurtz then researched all American, North African, and Middle Eastern deserts, and found Tunisia, near the Sahara desert, as the ideal location. In the director's commentary of the 2004 DVD edition of A New Hope, <b>Lucas</b> <b>said</b> he wanted to also make it look more [...] "spacy" [...] or outer space-like in style.|$|E
2500|$|After selling Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012, <b>Lucas</b> <b>said</b> {{his biggest}} {{concern about the}} franchise's future was the Force being [...] "muddled into a bunch of gobbledegook". When writing [...] (2015) with Lawrence Kasdan, J. J. Abrams {{respected}} that Lucas had established midi-chlorians' effect on some characters' ability to use the Force. As a child, though, he interpreted Obi-Wan Kenobi's explanation of the Force in Star Wars to mean that any character could use its power, and that the Force was more grounded in spirituality than science. Abrams retained {{the idea of the}} Force having a light and a dark side, and some characters' seduction by the dark side helps create conflict for the story.|$|E
2500|$|... 9 February 2011, Somma scored {{his first}} {{international}} goal against Kenya in only his second cap for South Africa. 21 March Somma was {{called up to}} the South Africa squad to face Egypt, however he was an unused substitute. In May 2011, South Africa legend <b>Lucas</b> Radebe <b>said</b> he believed that Somma {{could be the next}} Benni McCarthy for South Africa. 5 June Somma came on as a late substitute against Egypt to earn his 3rd cap in a 0â€“0 draw between the two countries.|$|R
5000|$|Creator George <b>Lucas</b> has <b>said</b> that chivalry, knighthood, paladinism {{and related}} {{institutions}} in feudal societies inspired some concepts in the Star Wars movies, {{most notably the}} Jedi Knights. The work of the mythologist Joseph Campbell, especially his book The Hero with a Thousand Faces, directly influenced Lucas, and is what drove him to create the [...] "modern myth" [...] of Star Wars. The natural flow of energy known as The Force {{is believed to have}} originated from the concept of prana, or qi/chi/ki, [...] "the all-pervading vital energy of the universe".|$|R
5000|$|Italian bishop <b>Luca</b> Brandolini <b>said,</b> [...] "This is {{the saddest}} moment {{in my life}} as a man, priest and bishop. It's a day of mourning, not just for me but for the many people who worked for the Second Vatican Council. A reform for which many people worked, with great {{sacrifice}} and only inspired by the desire to renew the Church, has now been cancelled." [...] However, he declared, [...] "I will obey the Holy Father, because I am a bishop and because I care for the Holy Father".|$|R
