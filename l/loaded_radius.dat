40|$|International audienceThe {{accurate}} {{determination of}} a vehicle's lateral behaviour {{is necessary in}} the domain of vehicle dynamics to improve vehicle safety. Its interaction with the road surface must be understood thoroughly, which requires the integration of a force model, representing the tyre-ground interface, into the global vehicle model. The validity of such a model directly depends on its nature and more particularly on the accurate determination of its inputs and outputs. This paper focuses on one input: the wheel camber angle. Studies in collaboration with a car maker have shown that a measurement error below 0. 1 ◦ is necessary to identify the tyre model parameters from real data accurately. At the same time, measurement performance must be insensitive to the test conditions, and more particularly to the road surface (tyre-road grip). For these reasons, a novel vision-based method for direct camber determination has been developed and a measurement prototype has been designed. Its vision-based principle is mainly aimed at giving accurate measurement. Its precision is robust to the road's unevenness and the vehicle's velocity; the tyre <b>loaded</b> <b>radius</b> is determined at the same time. The novel method's feasibility and the measurement performance of the designed prototype have been studied from real vehicle-on-track measurements with a test car...|$|E
40|$|Inflation {{pressure}} affects {{every aspect}} of tire performance. Most tire models, including the Radt/Milliken Nondimensional Tire Model, are restricted to modeling a single inflation pressure at a time. This is a reasonable limitation, in that the Nondimensional model forms an input/output relationship between tire operating conditions and force & moment outputs. Traditional operating conditions are normal load, slip angle, inclination angle, slip ratio and road surface friction coefficient. Tire pressure {{is more like a}} tire parameter than a tire operating condition. Since the Nondimensional Tire Model is semi-empirical it does not specifically deal with tire parameters like sidewall height or tread compound. Still, tire pressure is the easiest tire parameter to change, and as the air temperature within the tire varies during use so does the inflation pressure. Thus, it is desirable to incorporate inflation pressure into the Nondimensional Tire Model as an input. This paper discusses the effects of tire pressure on tire force and moment output. Effects on lateral force and aligning torque are investigated in detail. Additionally, the effects on cornering stiffness, friction coefficients, peak aligning torque coefficient and peak shape are reviewed. New techniques to implement pressure effects in the Nondimensional Model are presented. Applications of these techniques are shown on a Formula SAE tire and a full-size radial racing tire. Additionally, the effects of inflation pressure on tire spring rate and <b>loaded</b> <b>radius</b> are investigated. While these are not modeled using Nondimensional techniques, they are important variables accompanying any tire model...|$|E

In addition, effects of external <b>load,</b> <b>radius</b> clearance values, and material parameter on the mechanics performance were investigated. The {{results show that the}} value of external load has a direct pronounced effect on the contact characteristics of journal bearing. There is a significant positive correlation between contact pressure and external <b>load,</b> <b>radius</b> clearance value, and the Young's modulus of material. However, there is an evident negative correlation between contact radius of journal bearing and radius clearance value, and the Young's modulus of material. The smaller radius clearance value of journal bearing is, the more centralized contact region will be, so the corresponding contact pressure will be higher. From the perspective of reducing friction and wear, we need select the materials which have high strength and good toughness. Not only might this can improve the wear resistance, it also effectively decreases the contact pressure. In this case, we can prolong the service life of roller cone drill bits journal bearing...|$|R

The basic equations incorporating interference and contact of surface roughness are derived fundamentally through {{combination of the}} GW and PC models. Furthermore, a programming code that is applicable to the caulked-socket-type and open-socket-type bearings is developed. Effects of caulking, operating conditions, and the bearing dimension on {{the motion of the}} sphere and tribological performance of the bearings are examined. Salient conclusions are the following: The spheres eccentricity increases in the low supply pressure period. The time-lag of the load change engenders greater motion of the sphere.

40|$|The {{radial surface}} {{deflection}} of a spherical earth model appropriate to time scales characteristic of glacial loading is {{compared with the}} associated halfspace response. For that purpose the analytical solution for a Maxwell sphere surrounded by a thick elastic shell is derived under the assumption of incompressibility. The half-space approximation is deduced as a special case directly from the spherical solution. Comparison of the response spectra, for different thicknesses of the elastic shell, reveals only minor differences. In the spatial domain, the half-space approximation may, nevertheless, diverge significantly from the spherical solution. For a disk <b>load</b> <b>radius</b> R = 800 km (Fennoscandia), the half-space approximation is adequate, whereas it is usually inappropriate if R = 1600 km (Laurentia). The sensitivity of {{the response to the}} thickness of the elastic shell is also investigated.

40|$|We {{examine the}} errors {{caused by the}} neglect of the IGF using closed-form {{solutions}} of the equations governing surface-load induced perturbations of two types of incompressible, spherical-earth models: (1) Maxwellian-viscoelastic mantle enclosed by elastic lithosphere, and (2) Maxwellian-viscoelastic mantle enclosing inviscid core. Calculations in the Legendre domain of the radial surface displacement for these models show that neglecting the IGF causes enhancement of the elastic response and acceleration of the viscous relaxation. In the space domain, these changes entail corresponding modifications of the calculated land adjustment. The magnitude of the error caused by the neglect of the IGF strongly depends on the deglaciation history and <b>load</b> <b>radius</b> adopted. Assuming a typical deglaciation history, the error reaches a maximum of less than 20 m {{at the end of}} the deglaciation phase for loads comparable in size to the Canadian or the Fennoscandian ice sheets. We also compare spherical-earth models with IGF and plane-earth models without IGF. Calculations of the radial surface displacement show that the errors due to the neglect of sphericity and the IGF partially compensate each other. Taking the uncertainties of the observational data into account, we conclude that the majority of the Canadian and Fennoscandian glacial-isostatic adjustment data can be modelled with sufficient accuracy using a plane-earth model without IGF...|$|R

40|$|Comparisons of {{measured}} total radiated x-ray {{power from}} annular wire-array z-pinches {{with a variety}} of models as a function of wire number, array mass, and <b>load</b> <b>radius</b> are reviewed. The data, which are comprehensive, have provided important insights into the features of wire-array dynamics that are critical for high x-ray power generation. Collectively, the comparisons of the data with the model calculations suggest that a number of underlying dynamical mechanisms involving cylindrical asymmetries and plasma instabilities contribute to the measured characteristics. For example, under the general assumption that the measured risetime of the total-radiated-power pulse is related to the thickness of the plasma shell formed on axis, the Heuristic Model [IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci., 26, 1275 (1998) ] agrees with the measured risetime under a number of specific assumptions about the way the breakdown of the wires, the wire-plasma expansion, and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in the r-z plane, interact. Likewise, in the high wire-number regime (where the wires are calculated to form a plasma shell prior to significant radial motion of the shell) the comparisons show that the variation {{in the power of the}} radiation generated as a function of load mass and array radius can be simulated by the 2 -D Eulerian-radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code (E-RMHC) [Phys. Plasmas 3, 368 (1996) ], using a single random-density perturbation that seeds the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in the r-z plane. For a given pulse-power generator, the comparisons suggest that (1) the smallest interwire gaps compatible with practical load construction and (2) the minimum implosion time consistent with the optimum required energy coupling of the generator to the load should produce the highest total-radiated-power levels...|$|R

40|$|The aerosol {{radiative}} {{effect in}} the long-wave (LW) spectral range is sometimes not {{taken into account in}} atmospheric aerosol forcing studies at local scale because the LW aerosol effect is assumed to be negligible. At regional and global scale this effect is partially taken into account: aerosol absorption is taken into account but scattering is still neglected. However, aerosols with strong absorbing and scattering properties in the LW region, like mineral dust, can have a non-negligible radiative {{effect in the}} LW spectral range (both at surface and top of the atmosphere) which can counteract their cooling effect occurring in the short-wave spectral range. The first objective of this research is to perform a sensitivity study of mineral dust LW radiative forcing (RF) as a function of dust microphysical and optical properties using an accurate radiative transfer model which can compute vertically resolved short-wave and long-wave aerosol RF. Radiative forcing simulations in the LW range have shown an important sensitivity to the following parameters: aerosol <b>load,</b> <b>radius</b> of the coarse mode, refractive index, aerosol vertical distribution, surface temperature and surface albedo.
