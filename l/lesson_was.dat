The {{experience of the}} Spanish Civil War proved invaluable - air and ground crews perfected their skills, and equipment was evaluated under combat conditions.

5|$|The {{film was}} advertised to the American churchgoer {{as a moral}} picture. The film was {{generally}} well received by critics, but the faults of story {{for the sake of}} a moral <b>lesson</b> <b>was</b> noted.

5|$|Capcom {{discovered}} a few business principles through {{their experience with}} development and release of the five. The first was to focus on multi-platform releases. Second, Capcom needed to streamline development. Prior to the five, the company had announced expected losses of US$103 million for fiscal year 2002, largely due to poor sales and extended development times, and ultimately posted over US$163 million in losses. Resident Evil 4 was a case in point, beginning development in 1999 and going through four discarded versions {{by the time of}} its 2005 release. The third <b>lesson</b> <b>was</b> to focus on old franchises rather than create new ones; Resident Evil 4 was the only unmitigated commercial success of the five and also the only game based on an existing property. To wit, Viewtiful Joe 2 started development shortly after the release of Viewtiful Joe and was completed just a year later. However, the brisk schedule meant that the team was not given time to implement all the features they had wanted, including a cooperative gameplay mode. Viewtiful Joe 2 debuted on both GameCube and PlayStation 2 to reach a wider audience and maximize profitability.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{his return}} to Lake Temagami, Belaney's fascination with the Anishinaabe people increased. Belaney set about {{studying}} their language and lore while conducting a relationship with Ojibwa co-worker Angele Egwuna. Egwuna furthered Belaney's knowledge of trapping and fish nets, and also provided access to a network of Ojibwe people. Belaney claims he passionately embraced {{the cause of the}} Ojibwe Indians, and that in turn the Ojibwe treated Belaney as one of their own. In 1909, Belaney spent a winter with the Ojibwa trappers, and claimed he had been adopted as an Ojibwa trapper. In Donald B. Smith's From the Land of Shadows, it is said that Belaney's greatest <b>lesson</b> <b>was</b> the fragility of the environmental ecosystem, which was influential in forming his conservationist views. On August 23, 1910, he and Angele Egwuna married.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, this <b>lesson</b> <b>was</b> slow {{to sink in}} and {{at first}} the VOC made the {{strategic}} decision to improve its military position on the Malabar Coast (hoping thereby to curtail English influence in the area, and end the drain on its resources from {{the cost of the}} Malabar garrisons) by using force to compel the Zamorin of Calicut to submit to Dutch domination. In 1710, the Zamorin was made to sign a treaty with the VOC undertaking to trade exclusively with the VOC and expel other European traders. For a brief time, this appeared to improve the Company's prospects. However, in 1715, with EIC encouragement, the Zamorin renounced the treaty. Though a Dutch army managed to suppress this insurrection temporarily, the Zamorin continued to trade with the English and the French, which led to an appreciable upsurge in English and French traffic. The VOC decided in 1721 that it was no longer worth the trouble to try to dominate the Malabar pepper and spice trade. A strategic decision was taken to scale down the Dutch military presence and in effect yield the area to EIC influence.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by David Silverman. When the episode was originally planned, it called for Albert Brooks to voice [...] "Björn", a Swedish tennis instructor, but Brooks {{thought it would be}} funnier to make the character French and so the change was made. The title was originally to be [...] "Bjorn to Be Wild", thus accounting for the episode's alternate title [...] "Jacques to Be Wild". Brooks improvised almost all of his dialogue, producing over three hours of material. Marge's laugh during her bowling <b>lesson</b> <b>was</b> an ad-libbed, natural laugh by Julie Kavner, who was laughing at something Albert Brooks had just said. The line [...] "four onion rings!" [...] was one of the many lines that Brooks ad-libbed and when saying it, Jacques loses his French accent. An extended audio clip of Albert Brooks' unused dialogue was made available on Disc Three of The Simpsons The Complete First Season DVD.|$|E
500|$|The flight-test {{programme}} was {{ended on}} 19 December 2002, when the aircraft's port horizontal tail broke off during a high-g manoeuvre near Moscow. This {{was caused by}} structural failure due to the aircraft's repeated exceeding of its design load during six years of testing. The pilot [...] ejected safely. Despite Sukhoi's entry of the Su-37 into Brazilian and South Korean fighter tenders, the aircraft failed to gain any foreign customers. However, India in the mid-1990s funded the development of what {{would result in the}} Su-30MKI, which is a two-seat fighter design that incorporated the canards, N011M radar and thrust-vectoring technology that were present and evaluated on the Su-37. In addition, through tests of the Su-27M and the Su-37, engineers had determined that thrust vectoring could compensate for the loss of manoeuvrability brought about by the removal of canards, the design of which imposed a weight penalty on the design. This <b>lesson</b> <b>was</b> incorporated into the modernized Su-35, which made its first flight in February 2008.|$|E

500|$|By 1870 {{three of}} the {{important}} lessons of the Austro-Prussian war had become apparent. The first <b>lesson</b> <b>was</b> that, through force of arms, a powerful state could challenge the old alliances and spheres of influence established in 1815. Second, through diplomatic maneuvering, a skillful leader could create {{an environment in which}} a rival state would declare war first, thus forcing states allied with the [...] "victim" [...] of external aggression to come to the leader's aid. Finally, as Prussian military capacity far exceeded that of Austria, Prussia was clearly the only state within the Confederation (or among the German states generally) capable of protecting all of them from potential interference or aggression. In 1866, most mid-sized German states had opposed Prussia, but by 1870 these states had been coerced and coaxed into mutually protective alliances with Prussia. In the event that a European state declared war on one of their members, they all would come to the defense of the attacked state. With skillful manipulation of European politics, Bismarck created a situation in which France would play the role of aggressor in German affairs, while Prussia would play that of the protector of German rights and liberties.|$|E

40|$|Since we are forced, by our lifestyles, to {{sit down}} most of the time, it is of {{extremely}} important to carry out physical education (PE) {{at the highest level}} possible. PE is, to many children, the only organized, professionally guided physical activity they will experience. The purpose of our investigation was to establish the duration of individual elements within PE lessons and to present elements that would, through optimization of their work, help teache rs put more attention on physical activities. Observations of 65 physical education <b>lessons</b> <b>were</b> performed and statistical data was processed with SPSS 16. 0 for Windows. According to the results, the introductory time of the <b>lessons</b> <b>is</b> usually much shorter than suggested and not enough attention is put to special warm-up. The main part of the <b>lessons</b> <b>is,</b> theoretically, of approp riate length, whereas {{the last part of the}} <b>lessons</b> <b>is</b> again too short. Since teachers do not optimize the time spent on unnecessary activities, PE <b>lessons</b> <b>are,</b> as a rule, shorter than 45 minutes. As a cons equence of the above factors, students 19 effective involvement during physical education <b>lessons</b> <b>is</b> lower than expected.

A book review stated the book was one of rare merit, with an undertone of sadness, a refrain of grief and pathos, running through all her poems; but their <b>lesson</b> <b>was</b> always of patience and resignation and hope, rather than despondency or despair.

Researcher George Porta suggests that Florescu never actually took hold of his chair, being snubbed by two successive Education Ministers: Christian Tell and Vasile Boerescu.

As a volunteer, Hill worked with credit unions and when he discovered that one board of directors had stolen 60 percent of their members' money, he reported on the malfeasance to their members, who promptly re-elected them because the board reflected carefully balanced tribal interests and it really did not matter to the members if the board directors ran a good credit union or not. Hill said the <b>lesson</b> <b>was</b> that [...] "When something's happened, it's happened for a reason and you do your best to understand that reason.

2500|$|In the 1920s, {{international}} {{flows of}} speculative financial capital increased, leading to extremes in {{balance of payments}} situations in various European countries and the US. In the 1930s, world markets never broke through the barriers and restrictions on international trade and investment volume – barriers haphazardly constructed, nationally motivated and imposed. The various anarchic and often autarkic protectionist and neo-mercantilist national policies – often mutually inconsistent – that emerged over {{the first half of}} the decade worked inconsistently and self-defeatingly to promote national import substitution, increase national exports, divert foreign investment and trade flows, and even prevent certain categories of cross-border trade and investment outright. [...] Global central bankers attempted to manage the situation by meeting with each other, but their understanding of the situation as well as difficulties in communicating internationally, hindered their abilities.
