5|$|Despite having dark plumage in a {{tropical}} climate, frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat—particularly {{as they are}} exposed to full sunlight when on the nest. They ruffle feathers to <b>lift</b> <b>them</b> away from the skin and improve air circulation, and can extend and upturn their wings to expose the hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection. Frigatebirds also place their heads in the shade of their wings, and males frequently flutter their gular pouches.|$|E

He proposed tangible steps to recover the rapidly deteriorating relationship between Washington and Khartoum. In March 1996, El Fatih Erwa, then minister of state for defense, was authorized by President Omar al-Bashir to make several secret trips to the United States to hold talks with U.S. officials, including Carney and senior C.I.A. Africa experts, about U.S. sanctions policy against Sudan and what measures might be taken by the Bashir regime to <b>lift</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Kaga, a {{civil war}} had broken out between Togashi Masachika and Kochiyo Masachika {{for control of the}} {{position}} of shugo over the province. Kochiyo was victorious against his brother and drove him out of Kaga. When the Ōnin War began in 1467, Masachika sided with the Hosokawa clan, while Kochiyo sided with the Yamana. Kochiyo also patronized Takada school of Jōdo Shinshū, a fierce rival of the Hongan-ji school of which Rennyo was head. Masachika, seeking to reclaim his land, reached out to the Ikkō-ikki and asked for their support. In exchange, he promised to end their religious persecution and <b>lift</b> <b>them</b> out of poverty. The priests in Yoshizaki agreed to aid Masachika, and Rennyo, though alarmed by the rebellious attitude of the rebels, tacitly rendered his support as well. Asakura Toshikage, the ruler of Echizen and ally of the Hosokawa, also lent his support. Kochiyo was defeated, and Masachika restored to power.|$|E

5|$|Where it was {{necessary}} for the pipeline to curve to fit the route, the steel pipes were bent, using either a cold-bending approach, in which tractors would pull and push the pipelines into position, or a hot-bending method, with the pipe heated up by blow-torches and pulled into place using a jig. A new, specialized piece of equipment for bending pipes, the Cummings bending jig, was invented during the Big Inch build, and used on the construction of the Little Big Inch pipeline. To protect the pipeline from corrosion, its outside was then cleaned by machine, and painted in first a layer of coal tar enamel, and then hot coal tar coating, before being wrapped in asbestos felt. Finally the pipeline was lowered into position, taking care not to damage the ends of the pipes; the larger pipes were so heavy that they required a D-8 caterpillar tractor equipped with counter-weights to <b>lift</b> <b>them.</b> The trench was then back-filled, completing the process.|$|E
5|$|On Halloween, Michael and Elliott dress E.T. as a ghost so {{they can}} sneak {{him out of the}} house. That night, Elliott and E.T. head through the forest, where they make a {{successful}} call home. The next day, Elliott wakes up in the field, only to find E.T. gone. Elliott returns home to his distressed family. Michael searches for and finds E.T. dying next to a culvert, being investigated by a raccoon. Michael takes E.T. home to Elliott, who is also dying. Mary becomes frightened when she discovers her son's illness and the dying alien, just as government agents invade the house. Scientists set up a hospital at the house, questioning Michael, Mary and Gertie while treating Elliott and E.T. Their connection disappears and E.T. then appears to die while Elliott recovers. A grief-stricken Elliott is left alone with the motionless E.T. when he notices a dead chrysanthemum, the plant E.T. had previously revived, coming back to life. E.T. reanimates and reveals that his people are returning. Elliott and Michael steal a van that E.T. had been loaded into and a chase ensues, with Michael's friends joining them as they attempt to evade the authorities by bicycles. Suddenly facing a police roadblock, they escape as E.T. uses telekinesis to <b>lift</b> <b>them</b> into the air and toward the forest, like he had done for Elliott before.|$|E

25|$|In the 2005–06 FA Cup 3rd round Torquay {{managed to}} pull off a 0–0 draw with Premiership strugglers Birmingham City. However they lost the replay at St Andrew's 2–0. Despite this {{achievement}} (and the windfall generated by the replay) the club fell into the relegation places of League Two. Former Exeter City manager John Cornforth took over as caretaker manager from Leroy Rosenior and soon after was appointed as manager {{until the end of the}} season. The side's form worsened however, and Ian Atkins replaced Cornforth in April. Torquay United's form immediately turned around going on a four-match unbeaten run, Atkins managed to rescue the side and <b>lift</b> <b>them</b> a comfortable three points from relegation.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{international}} break, 20 November 2011 saw Parma welcome league leaders Udinese to the Tardini. Udinese travelled without a win {{in five years}} at Parma's ground and came the closer to opening the scoring in the first half, but neither side was able to break the deadlock. In the second half, pacey wingman Jonathan Biabiany headed in from a Giovinco corner to give Parma a lead with just over {{half an hour to}} go. Fifteen minutes later, Dušan Basta was adjudged to have fouled Biabiany in the penalty area and Giovinco stepped up to convert the penalty from 12 yards out to give Parma a remarkable two-goal victory and <b>lift</b> <b>them</b> out of {{the bottom half of the}} table.|$|E
25|$|Durham Dynamos won a low-scoring game at Headingley as {{both these}} sides looked to wave goodbye to a quarter-final spot. Yorkshire Phoenix were sent in to bat, but {{struggled}} to score runs, falling to 12 for three early on. Durham captain Dale Benkenstein bowled himself for two overs to take three wickets for 10, and that spell set Yorkshire back sufficiently to limit them to 123 for 7 – despite {{a total of}} 10 extras. Matthew Hoggard and Tim Bresnan then took three quick wickets between them to reduce Durham to 15 for 3, but despite eight wickets falling in the Durham innings, Phil Mustard's 31 and an identical score from No. 8 Gary Scott was enough to <b>lift</b> <b>them</b> to 124 for 8 with an over remaining.|$|E

Yorkshire Phoenix were sent in to bat, and lost their first three wickets for 12 runs. Durham captain Dale Benkenstein bowled himself for two overs to take three wickets for 10, and Yorkshire's {{eventual}} total was 123 for 7, despite a total of 10 extras.

25|$|The Blackhand Edition uses {{both the}} Wii Remote and the Nunchuk; if an enemy {{is on their}} knees, the player can pull the {{controllers}} upwards to <b>lift</b> <b>them</b> off the ground. Similarly, swinging the controllers {{from side to side}} swings an enemy around. Melee combat is similar to Wii Sports Boxing - the player literally throws the type of punch they want Aldo to throw in the game. Slamming enemies against walls is accomplished by shoving the controllers towards the screen, and head-butts, by quickly raising them upwards. The remote can also be used for executions, which require specific gestures, for opening doors, and for reloading weapons. For example, to reload a shotgun, the player must move the Nunchuk upwards and then quickly downwards to mimic the pump action of the weapon, and to reload a revolver, the player must flick the Nunchuk as if emptying the cylinder.|$|E
25|$|Leicestershire were in {{the game}} at Grace Road for exactly two days, after having Lancashire {{effectively}} 68 for 3 in the second innings. However, they lost it from there, and Lancashire took the win to go into {{second place in the}} Championship table. Lancashire had won the toss and batted first, with Iain Sutcliffe top scoring with 93, as nine batsmen made it into double figures but only Sutcliffe managed a fifty. Medium pacer Ryan Cummins got three for 32 in his first game for Leicestershire, but only bowled ten overs, as the captain preferred an ineffective but economical Claude Henderson. After making their way to 16 for 0 on the first day, Leicestershire fell apart twice, first from 69 for 0 to 78 for 4 and then from 160 for 5 to 183 for 8. However, Aftab Habib made 84 to <b>lift</b> <b>them</b> to 261, only 30 behind Lancashire's first-innings score.|$|E

25|$|The {{start of}} the match at Aberdeen was delayed due to rain, but when it did get underway, Ireland {{immediately}} got into trouble. The first two partnerships didn't add a single run, four batsmen departed for ducks, and Craig Wright got four wickets for the hosting Scots. Ireland crumbled to 128 for 9 before 17-year-old Greg Thompson from Lisburn hit 35 from number 10 to become the top scorer of the innings. Steven Knox hit 38 for the Scots, however, as they moved to 104 for 2. Tight bowling frustrated the Scots, who were looking for quick runs, but at least Cedric English hit 66 to <b>lift</b> <b>them</b> to 234 - a lead of 62. Ryan Watson and Dewald Nel got a wicket each before stumps, the Irish second innings score 46 for 2. Dominic Joyce, brother of more famous Ed, came to the crease as the new batsman on the third morning, and he scored 61 before being lbw to Dewald Nel - a crucial innings. The rest of the batsmen stuck in, defending against Paul Hoffmann, who bowled 18 overs for 33 runs, but only got the one wicket.|$|E
