The key question is whether an aging and shrinking population has enough talents to sustain the innovation process {{that is at the}} basis of our prosperity. In this paper we deal with the age distributions <b>of</b> <b>inventivity.</b> Specifically, we confirm past conjectures that inventive productivity is age dependent and unequally distributed among inventors. Additionally, we advance the new hypothesis that any age-bias in innovation activity should show up as industry-specific. The reason is that creative productivity is depending on the rate of technological change that on its part is industry specific. We test this hypothesis with European patent data for Germany. innovation, patents, age-dependent productivity, demographics, sectors...|$|R

5000|$|Lacan first {{designated}} a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> being: what is desired is being itself. [...] "Desire is a relation to being to lack.

[...] (Seminar: The Ego in Freud's Theory) In [...] "The Direction of the Treatment and the Principles of Its Power" [...] (Écrits) Lacan argues that desire is the metonymy <b>of</b> the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> being (manque à être): the subject's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> being {{is at the heart}} of the analytic experience and the very field in which the neurotic's passion is deployed. In [...] "Guiding Remarks for a Convention on Feminine Sexuality" [...] Lacan contrasts the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> being related to desire with the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> having (manque à avoir) which he relates to demand.|$|R

The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sexual arousal {{may be due to}} a general <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sexual desire or due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sexual desire for the current partner (i.e., situational).

30|$|However, {{internet}} inequality is {{more than}} a mere functionalist propaganda. It is the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sensibility. Van Dijk and Hacker (2003) proposed four different forms of internet inequality, which they contend is a question of “access”. In other words, the extent of internet inequality depends on the kind of access defined or denied. The first is the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> “psychological access”, which simply refers to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> elementary digital experience caused by a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> interest, computer fear, and unattractiveness of the new technology. The second is the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> “material access”. This simply indicates a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> possessing a computer and network connection. The third dimension is the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> “skill access”, which is a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> digital and professional skills caused by insufficient user-friendliness and inadequate education and social support. The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> “usage access” signifies the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> meaningful usage opportunities for the online user, who perhaps has relative experience in the first three categories. (Van Dijk and Hacker 2003 : 315 – 326). The fourth type of access is associated with the functionalist view of internet inequality in this article, which implies that access to internet opportunities is given to privileged users and restricted to unprivileged users for the greater good of the internet economy.|$|R
30|$|Literature on SMEs {{and large}} {{enterprises}} in Oman {{shows that the}} challenges faced by enterprises are pervasive and include HR related issues, financial issues, operational issues, marketing issues, policy related and legal impediments. These challenges can be grouped into internal and external. Al Belushi and Bagum (2017) categorized the challenges into HR related (e.g. <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> managerial skills, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> knowledge to hire related employees), financial management (e.g. <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> availability <b>of</b> credit, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> long-term credits, working capital management issues, high cost <b>of</b> finance, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> marketing budget), operations management (e.g. <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> accurate knowledge of outsourcing and supplier’s management, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> access to latest technology), and marketing management (e.g. <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> marketing knowledge, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> R&D to identify new markets and products). Similarly, Al-Mataani (2017) concluded that the challenges faced by SMEs are mainly bureaucratic related caused by rigid regulations, inefficient labor market, immature entrepreneurship education, and support policies. Further, there are certain pertinent {{issues related to the}} mindset that relates to the risk aversion culture, the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> an entrepreneurial mindset, and undervaluing self-employment. The limited entrepreneurial mindset leads societies to fail to acknowledge and appreciate high achieving entrepreneurs by giving higher status to certain professions than successful entrepreneurs (Al-Shanfari et al. 2013; Porter 2004).|$|R
