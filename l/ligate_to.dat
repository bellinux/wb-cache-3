5000|$|The analyte is {{also called}} the ligand because it will {{specifically}} bind or <b>ligate</b> <b>to</b> a detection reagent, thus ELISA falls under the bigger category of ligand binding assays. The ligand-specific binding reagent is [...] "immobilized", i.e., usually coated and dried onto the transparent bottom and sometimes also side wall of a well (the stationary [...] "solid phase'/"solid substrate" [...] here as opposed to solid microparticle/beads that can be washed away), which is usually constructed as a multiple-well plate known as the [...] "ELISA plate". Conventionally, like other forms of immunoassays, the specificity of antigen-antibody type reaction is used because {{it is easy to}} raise an antibody specifically against an antigen in bulk as a reagent. Alternatively, if the analyte itself is an antibody, its target antigen can be used as the binding reagent.|$|E
50|$|When {{it is not}} {{possible}} to use two different sites, then the vector DNA may need to be dephosphorylated to avoid a high background of recircularized vector DNA with no insert. Without a phosphate group at the ends the vector cannot <b>ligate</b> <b>to</b> itself, but can be ligated to an insert with a phosphate group. Dephosphorylation is commonly done using calf-intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) which removes the phosphate group from the 5′ end of digested DNA, but note that CIAP is not easy to inactivate and can interfere with ligation without an additional step to remove the CIAP, thereby resulting in failure of ligation. CIAP should not be used in excessive amount and should only be used when necessary. Shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP) or Antarctic phosphatase (AP) are suitable alternative as they can be easily inactivated.|$|E
5000|$|The next {{case is that}} of Transglutaminases (TGases), which act mainly within eukaryotes for fusing {{together}} different proteins for {{a variety}} of reasons such as a wound healing or attaching proteins to lipid membranes. [...] The TGases themselves also contain their own ‘catalytic triad’ with Histidine, Aspartate, and Cysteine. The roles of these residues are analogous or the same as the previously described Sortases, in that His and Asp play a supporting role in interacting with the target residue, while the Cys forms a thioester with a carboxyl group for a later nucleophilic attack by a primary amine, in this case due to interest that of Lysine. Though the similarities to sortase catalytically start to end there, as the enzyme and the family is dependent on calcium, which plays a crucial structural role in holding a tight conformation of the enzyme. The TGases, also have a very different substrate specificity in that they target specifically the middle Gln, in the sequence ‘Gln-Gln-Val’. The general substrate specificity, i.e. the specific protein is due to the general structure of different TGases which targets them to the substrate. The specificity has been noted in TGases such that different TGases will react with different Gln’s on the same protein, signifying that the enzymes have a very specific initial targeting. And also it has been shown to have some specificity as to which target Lysine it transfers the protein to, as in the case of Factor XIII, where the adjacent residue to the Lys decides whether the reaction will occur. Thus while the TGases may initially seem like a eukaryotic sortase, they stand on their own as separate set of enzymes. Another case of an isopeptide linking enzyme for structural purposes is the actin cross-linking domain (ACD) of the MARTX toxin protein generated by V. cholerae. While it has been shown that the ACD when performing the catalysis uses magnesium and ATP for the formation of the cross-links the specifics of the mechanism are uncertain. Though an interesting aspect of the cross-link formed in this case, is that it uses a non-terminal Glu to <b>ligate</b> <b>to</b> a non-terminal Lys, which seems to be rare in the process of forming an isopeptide bond. Though the chemistry of ACD is still to be resolved, it shows that isopeptide bond formation is not dependent simply on Asp/Asn for non-terminal isopeptide linkages between proteins.|$|E

40|$|Infrared spectra are {{reported}} of methyl formate and formaldehyde adsorbed at 300 K on silica, Cu/SiO 2 reduced in hydrogen and Cu/SiO 2 {{which had been}} oxidised by exposure to nitrous oxide after reduction. Silanol groups on silica form hydrogen bonds with carbonyl groups in weakly adsorbed methyl formate molecules. Methyl formate ligates via its carbonyl groups to Cu atoms in the surface of reduced copper. A low residual concentration of surface oxygen on copper promoted the slow reaction of ligated methyl formate to give a bridging formate species on copper and adsorbed methoxy groups. Methyl formate did not <b>ligate</b> <b>to</b> an oxidised copper surface but was rapidly chemisorbed to give unidentate formate and methoxy species. Formaldehyde slowly polymerises on silica to form trioxane and other oxymethylene species.

In the present study we used different exogenous NO congeners to investigate the effects of different redox forms of NO on iron metabolism and cellular proliferation of human K 562 erythroleukemia cells. Treatment of K 562 cells for 18 h with the nitrosonium ion (NO$ sp+$) donor, sodium nitroprusside (1 mM), decreased mRNA binding activity of iron regulatory factor (IRF), transferrin receptor (TfR) mRNA, TfR number and also iron uptake. However, cellular proliferation was not decreased. On the contrary, treatment of K 562 cells with the nitric oxide (NO$ cdot$) donor, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (1 mM), slightly increased IRF activity, TfR mRNA level, TfR number and iron uptake. Furthermore, cellular proliferation was decreased.

40|$|The kinetic {{analysis}} of IAsys biosensor association data usually relies upon {{the assumption of}} constant ligate concentration. In certain circumstances this assumption {{may no longer be}} valid. In a similar vein, the analysis of the dissociation phase assumes the concentration of <b>ligate</b> <b>to</b> be negligible in the liquid phase - an assumption that may not be sustainable for high-affinity interactions. In this paper we derive analytical solutions of the second-order differential kinetic equations for the association and dissociation phases, together with a binding isotherm that also allows for changes in concentration of both the ligand and the ligate. Using these equations it is possible to determine the conditions under which the pseudo- first-order assumption ceases to be valid. It is found that the effect of ligate depletion on the association rate constant becomes significant only when binding low ligate concentrations to ligand on surfaces with high binding capacities or high affinities. Similarly, the rebinding in the dissociation phase is dependent upon the affinity and the ligand capacity together with the starting dissociation response compared to the capacity. Finally, depletion also affects the form of the binding isotherm, particularly in situations involving high matrix capacities for ligate and high-affinity interactions...|$|E
40|$|L-serine deaminase 1 (L-SDI) is one {{of three}} enzymes that break down L-serine to produce {{pyruvate}} and ammonia in Escherichia coli K- 12. L-SD 1, a 454 amino acid protein encoded by sdaA gene, contains nine cysteine residues at the 181, 219, 290, 339, 347, 366, 381, 392, and 453 positions. Blast results show that three cysteines at positions 339, 381 and 392 are in what is then a highly conserved motif is found in most L-SDs that have a Fe-S cluster. The other six cysteine residues are also conserved among some bacterial L-SDs. In this study, all nine cysteine residues have been mutated individually. Assay of enzyme activity both in vivo and in vitro shows that: (1) eight of nine cysteine residues {{play an important role in}} L-SD 1 activity; (2) the cysteine at position 181 might be non-essential for L-SD 1 activity; (3) cysteines at positions 339, 381 and 392 are essential for L-SD 1 activity. This is consistent with the demonstration by Cicchilo and his colleagues that L-SD 1 uses a 4 Fe- 4 S cluster for the deamination of L-serine. If so, cysteine residues 339, 381 and 392 are probably essential for this iron-sulfur cluster and <b>ligate</b> <b>to</b> three iron molecules of a 4 Fe- 4 S cluster...|$|E

Previous work has established that amino acid derivatization of the carboxyl groups of (R,R) -N,N′-phthaloyl- 2, 3 -(2 -carboxyphenyl) -phenyl- 3, 4 -diazaphospholane (1) yields phosphines that are excellent ligands for palladium-catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation reactions. Alanine functionalization is particularly effective for allylic alkylation of 1, 3 -dimethylallyl acetate. Standard Merrifield resins and amino acid coupling methods are used to synthesize the bead-attached phosphine having the topology bead-linker-lAla-(R,R) - 1 -lAla-OMe, as a 1 : 1 mixture of linkage isomers. Use of this supported phosphine in Pd-catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation yields 92 % enantiomeric excess, matching prior solution-phase results. A 20 -member collection of amino acid-functionalized phosphines on beads with the topology bead-linker-AA 2 -AA 1 - 1 -AA 1 -AA 2 was synthesized by using parallel solid-state methods and screened for efficacy in allylic alkylation. Resulting enantioselectivities indicate that the AA 1 position has the strongest effect on the reaction.
