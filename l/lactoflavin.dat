50|$|Karrer's early {{research}} concerned complex metal compounds but {{his most}} important work has concerned plant pigments, particularly the yellow carotenoids. He elucidated their chemical structure and showed {{that some of these}} substances are transformed in the body into vitamin A. His work led to the establishment of the correct constitutional formula for beta-carotene, the chief precursor of vitamin A; {{the first time that the}} structure of a vitamin or provitamin had been established. George Wald worked briefly in Karrer's lab while studying the role of vitamin A in the retina. Later, Karrer confirmed the structure of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and extended his researches into the vitamin B2 and E. His important contributions to the chemistry of the flavins led to identification of <b>lactoflavin</b> as part of the complex originally thought to be vitamin B2.|$|E
40|$|During the 12 months ending May, 1937, 72 rats were {{observed}} that manifested typical symptoms of panmyelophthisis. The disease may start as agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia or pure red cell anemia, leading progressively, often rapidly, to aleukia hemorrhagica with its typical manifestations (epistaxis, melena, hematuria, purpura). Blood examinations revealed correspondingly low white cell, red cell and platelet counts with very pronounced granulocytopenia (0 to 4 per cent). Bone marrow smears and histological findings {{were consistent with}} the diagnosis of panmyelophthisis. Suprarenal hemorrhage was a frequent postmortem finding. The pathogenesis of this experimental panmyelophthisis and this hemorrhagic diathesis is confined to special nutritional conditions. These diseases have been observed by us in rats kept on a diet deficient in vitamin B 6, containing cane sugar and supplemented with vitamin B 1 and crystalline natural or synthetic <b>lactoflavin.</b> Lack of vitamin B 6, however, is not a necessary condition, since the disease was encountered in the majority of the animals after the specific deficiency disease which became apparent in rats kept on the B 6 free diet was successfully treated with purified B 6 preparations. Even in the untreated animals kept on the B 6 deficient diet acrodynia was, as a rule, in distinct remission before symptoms of panmyelophthisis and hemorrhagic diathesis became manifest. By means of the addition of Peters' eluate to the basal diet, panmyelophthisis could be prevented and, in animals where it was recognized in an early stage, cured. In view of these facts it is suggested that Peters' eluate contains a specific maturation factor for the primary blood-producing tissue, the reticulo-endothelium, a factor which, being different from <b>lactoflavin,</b> vitamin B 6 and probably also from the so called filtrate factor, constitutes another distinct component of the vitamin B 2 group. Bacteriological studies brought forward no conclusive positive evidence for the infectious etiology of the experimental panmyelophthisis in our rats. The possible relation of this new disease in rats to aleukia hemorrhagica and its partial manifestations in man, {{as well as to the}} so called Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, is discussed. Administration of amidopyrine, at least under the conditions chosen, failed to provoke panmyelophthisis in rats kept on the same diet as that given to rats in which the disease spontaneously developed...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} {{evidence}} is presented {{for the existence}} of mammalian acetoacetate decarboxylase (acetoacetate carboxy-lyase: E. G. 4. 1. 1. 4). From experiments with human blood serum the presence of a non-ultrafiltrable activator, accelerating the decomposition of acetoacetate into acetone and carbon dioxide, is established. Kinetic studies about this activator are performed by means of repeated gas Chromatographie determination of acetone in the head space vapour. From the experiments with different, more or less purified, human protein fractions it can be concluded that the enzyme activity present in human blood serum is located in the albumin fraction and demonstrates : (1) an optimal activity at pH = 4. 5, (2) a low substrate affinity (Km = 4 (± 1. 5) · 10 − 1 M), (3) a temperature coefficient (Q 10) of 2. 5 in the range 20 °– 40 °, (4) heat instability at 80 °, (5) loss of activity by denaturation with HgCl 2, (6) inhibition of enzyme activity by iodoacetate and urea, (7) activation of enzyme activity by <b>lactoflavin.</b> No inhibition of the enzyme activity was found by addition of CN− or pyruvic acid. Also the presence of acetoacetate decarboxylase activity in rat liver tissue is mentioned...|$|E
