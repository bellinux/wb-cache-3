40|$|Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) rubber {{emerges as}} a {{dominant}} elastomer for major engineering applications. The major properties of EPDM are its outstanding heat, ozone and weather resistance ability. It has a good resistance to polar substances and steam condition too. In automobiles EPDM rubber has a common use as seals. This includes door seals, window seals, trunk seals and sometimes hood seals. Frequently these seals {{are the source of}} noise due to the movement of the door versus the car body. This is due to friction between the EPDM rubber parts and the mating surfaces. Thus, the contact iteration between the rubber sealing and the indenting object must be known to optimize the performance of rubber sealing. However, it is need less to mention that the behaviour of any viscoelastic material is very difficult to be predicted. In the present work various tribo-characteristics of EPDM rubber of different hardness have been evaluated utilizing the available laboratory test facilities in the Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India. Compression tests have been carried out using ‘Instron’ to determine the flow behaviour of EPDM rubber of different hardness both in dry as well as under different conditions of lubrication. The flow behaviour like <b>load</b> -vs. - <b>elongation</b> <b>curves,</b> true stress -vs. - <b>elongation</b> <b>curves</b> and true stress -vs. - true strain curves have been drawn from the experimental data. Abrasive wear behaviour has been evaluated using a two-body abrasion tester and the pattern abrasion has been appraised through SEM/EDAX study. Experimental results reveal that the hardness of EPDM rubber has significant effect on the flow behaviour and wear characteristics. The hardness, again, depends on the proportion of carbon black (CB) content. Thus it can be stated that the flow behaviour can be governed by controlling the CB concentration in the EPDM rubber. Based on the experimental results conclusion has been drawn accordingly. Some of the important tribo-characteristics of EPDM have been highlighted. Light has also been shed on various possible areas of further researches those should be undertaken in the future to come...|$|R

In particular, the fibers from the coconut fruit, known as coir fibers, are nowadays extensively used in many industrial applications, including seat cushions and panels for automobiles [3]. The most technological intensive applications are associated with coir fiber reinforced polymeric composites. In these composites the mechanical properties depend on the fiber’s critical length and {{the resistance of the}} fiber/matrix interface.

Este trabalho teve como objetivo analisar as propriedades mecânicas do músculo gastrocnêmio lesionado por impacto direto e tratado com crioterapia. Para tanto, foram utilizadas 24 ratas Wistar, divididas em três grupos experimentais: grupo controle (C) : animais mantidos em gaiolas-padrão por seis dias; grupo lesionado (L) : animais submetidos à lesão por mecanismo de impacto no gastrocnêmio, sem tratamento e mantidos em gaiolas-padrão por seis dias; grupo lesionado e tratado com crioterapia (LC) : animais submetidos à lesão, tratados com uma sessão de crioterapia, imediatamente após a lesão e mantidos em gaiolas-padrão por seis dias. Após essas etapas, os animais foram submetidos à eutanásia para que fossem realizados os ensaios mecânicos de tração dos músculos gastrocnêmios direitos, na máquina {{universal}} de ensaios (EMIC®). A partir dos gráficos carga versus alongamento de cada ensaio, foram calculadas as seguintes propriedades mecânicas: carga no limite máximo (CLM), alongamento no limite máximo (ALM) e rigidez (R). No ALM, o grupo C apresentou diferença estatística (p < 0, 05) somente quando comparado com o L. Quando analisadas carga máxima e rigidez, houve diferença estatística (p < 0, 05) nos três grupos. Assim, enquanto os músculos lesionados sem tratamento apresentaram diminuição de todas as propriedades mecânicas analisadas, os tratados com crioterapia mostraram melhora das propriedades, porém, sem alcançar o grupo controle. Dessa forma, podemos concluir que a sessão de crioterapia por imersão imediata após a lesão promoveu melhora das propriedades mecânicas analisadas. Cryotherapy {{is widespread}} {{used in the}} acute treatment of muscle injuries of professional and unprofessional athletes. The {{purpose of this study}} was the investigation of mechanical properties of gastrocnemius muscle submitted to a impact mechanism of injury and treated with cryoterapy. Therefore, twenty four female Wistar rats were divided into three groups: Control (C) : animals housed in standard cages for six days; Lesion (L) : animals submitted to a direct impact mechanism of injury in the gastrocnemius muscle, without any treatment and kept into standard cages during six days; Lesion e cryotherapy (LC) : animals submitted to the contusion, treated with a single session of cryotherapy immediately after lesion and housed in standard cages during six days. After those protocols, the rats were killed and their right gastrocnemius muscle were dissected and submitted to a mechanical test of traction in a universal assays machine (EMIC®).

In all tests conducted on this material, creep curves showed only tertiary stage and the surface connected intergranular cracking was found to be dominant in creep fracture. It was shown that γ′ precipitate coarsening occurs in the bulk of the specimens and obeys the LSW kinetics. Metallographic analysis led to the conclusion that creep does not alter oxidation, except at grain boundaries, where oxide spikes can be developed under creep. Therefore grain boundary oxidation was found to be creep strain-assisted. A constitutive model accounting for precipitate coarsening was proposed. The oxidation-assisted intergranular damage and the oxidation embrittlement of the microstructure elements phenomena were successfully described using the continuum damage mechanics and the local ductility exhaustion laws, respectively.

The experimental data obtained so far included too large errors of measurement to allow precise mathematical description. The combination of laser diffraction with image analysis has im-proved ektacytometry considerably, such that the error of measurement is reduced to less than 0. 5 %. In laminar flow RBC of healthy donors are elongated elliptically (p ≤ 0. 001). Using the precise data of elliptical deformation, the <b>elongation</b> <b>curve</b> can be described to be hyperbolic. Hence, the double reciprocal plot gives a linear curve which- {{over a wide range}} of shear stress (15 to 500 dyn/cm 2) - fits well the experimental data (r ≥ 0. 99 : p ≤ 0. 001). The stress strain characteristics (i. e. <b>elongation</b> <b>curve)</b> can be described by two parameters: maximum elongation (Emax) and the shear stress needed for half-maximum elongation (KE). Mechanical stress only slightly reduces Emax but significantly shifts KE to higher values. Hyper-osmolarity decreases Emax and increases KE. Mild hypo-osmolarity (> 225 mOsm.) increases Emax and decreases KE, whereas strong hypo-osmolarity (≤ 225 mOsm.) decreases Emax and further decreases KE Inclusion of elongation data measured at shear stress < 15 dyn/cm 2 detoriates the linear correlation. The elongation coefficients measured for low shear stress are higher than calculated by linear regression. The same holds true for range of shear stress between 15 and 25 dyn/cm 2 if applied to RBC in hypertonic solu-tions or to cells which underwent mechanical stress. Further analysis of the laser diffraction patterns led us to suggest that at low shear stress the RBC become more or less oriented thereby presenting their side aspect (2. 2 µm ⋅ 8 µm) to the laser beam. The diffraction pattern then resemble to those of elongated RBC. At shear stress exceeding 15 dyn/⋅cm 2 the RBC rotate by 90 ° presenting their circular aspects (∅ 8 µm) which then become elliptically deformed by shear. 2...|$|R

This uncertainty leads to low coefficients of utilisation of the geotextiles in the dimensioning procedures and thus to constructions which cannot be evaluated in terms of safety and which are often not economical. With the laboratory tests 'lateral pressure device' and 'transverse force introduction', the bond behaviour of geotextiles with the surrounding soil was realistically simulated and studied. These tests provided input parameters for calculations using the finite element method (FEM). Lateral pressure devices were used to study the <b>load</b> <b>elongation</b> behaviour of geotextiles in contact with soil. These test devices {{make it possible to}} apply a tensile load to the geotextiles in the soil. The geotextile sample is fastened on two clamps; one end is held in place. At the other end the tensile force is introduced. Vertically to the geotextile level, soil layers and compressed air bellows are installed. These compressed air bellows are used to simulate the load in the construction. In the tests, various geotextile products (mechanically bonded fabrics, thermally bonded fabric, woven textile) were studied. Two different types of soil (fine gravel and coarse clay) were used. The influence of the type of soil and the soil load on the <b>load</b> <b>elongation</b> behaviour were studied. The tests showed that the deformation behaviour of the geotextiles studies is decisively characterised by the soil. The deformation module of the geotextile samples is clearly higher in the bond with the soil than in the tests without contact to the soil. This is caused by the transmission of transverse strain between soil and geotextile and by the dispersion of soil particles {{in the structure of the}} geotextiles. Thus an inner bond arises. The raw material of the geotextiles had a clear influence on the deformation behaviour. The tests showed that exceptional suitability of polyester as a reinforcement material. The transverse movement test is a modified shear test in which a geotextile reinforcement is also installed in addition to the soil material. The reinforcement is perpendicular arranged in relation to the shear joint. This test construction is used to simulate the behaviour of the geotextile/soil/bond system in the proximity of the fracture joint in reinforced steep slopes which is formed when the shear strength of the soil material is exceeded. The deformation of the geotextile which occurs under this transverse force load causes an increase in the resistance to shearing and thus an increase of the ultimate load of these bond systems. On the basis of the results of this research study, it is possible to give a plausible explanation for the good success with geotextiles as reinforcement of earthworks. This success could not be comprehended, in particular for the non wovens, from the tests without soil, the results of which are included in the current dimensioning approaches. The results of this research study can, therefore, serve as the basis for a dimensioning approach which realistically records the influence of the soil and the deformations of the bond system.

40|$|Innovation in {{the field}} of {{protected}} crops represents an argument of great applied and theoretical research attention due to constantly evolving technologies and automation for higher quality flower and vegetable production and to the corresponding environmental and economic impact. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide an analysis of some thermomechanical properties of rigid polymeric laminates for greenhouses claddings, including innovative tests such as the thermographic ones. Four types of laminates have been analysed: two polycarbonates, a polymethylmethacrylate and a polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The tests gave interesting results on different important properties, such as radiometric properties, limit stresses, strains and ductility. Moreover, a direct comparison of infrared images and force <b>elongation</b> <b>curves</b> gave important information on the relation of the (localised or homogeneous) damage evolution, with both an applicative and theoretical implication. Finally, even if to the authors knowledge at present there are no examples of using PET for covering greenhouses, the results of this paper indicates the thermomechanical and radiometric characteristics of this material make it interesting for agricultural applications...|$|R
40|$|The environment-induced {{cracking}} (EIC) {{of aluminum}} alloy 5052 -H 3 was investigated {{as a function}} of applied stress and orientation (Longitudinal rolling direction—Transverse: LT and Transverse—Longitudinal rolling direction: TL) in 0. 5 [*]M sodium chloride solution (NaCl) using a constant load method. The applied stress dependence of the three parameters (time to failure; tf, steady-state elongation rate, Iss, and transition time at which a linear increase in elongation starts to deviate, tss) obtained from the corrosion <b>elongation</b> <b>curve</b> showed that these relationships were divided into three regions, the stress-dominated region, the EIC- dominated region, and the corrosion-dominated region. Aluminum alloy 5052 -H 3 with both orientations showed the same EIC behavior. The value of tss/tf in the EIC-dominated region was almost constant with 0. 57 ± 0. 02 independent of applied stress and orientation. The fracture mode was transgranular for 5052 -H 3 with both orientations in the EIC-dominated region. The relationships between log Iss and log tf for 5052 -H 3 in the EIC-dominated region became a good straight line with a slope of − 2 independent of orientation...|$|R
