500|$|As the {{revolution}} progressed, rebel strength peaked at around 50,000 fighters. Despite their initial successes, the rebel leaders were seldom on good terms, and constant infighting plagued their camp. In {{the western part}} of the country, Jakov Nenadoviƒá was the principle figure. In the east, Milenko Stojkoviƒá and Petar Dobrnjac held sway. The latter two opposed Karaƒëorƒëe's attempts to create a centralized state, fearing that this would result in their own power being diminished. Others, such as Nenadoviƒá, complained that Karaƒëorƒëe was becoming too authoritarian. Nenadoviƒá suggested that the rebels establish a central council to rein in Karaƒëorƒëe's power and write up a constitution based on the rule of law. Karaƒëorƒëe balked at the possibility. [...] "It's easy for this sovereign law of yours to rule in a warm room, behind this table," [...] he responded, [...] "but <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>see</b> tomorrow, when the Turks strike, who will meet them and beat them." ...|$|E
500|$|Madero also [...] {{earned the}} great displeasure of other revolutionaries, including, Pascual Orozco. Madero's first act after the treaty was signed was {{a gesture of}} {{reconciliation}} with the D√≠az regime. As {{a result of the}} treaty he was given the right to appoint members of the la Barra cabinet. He chose mostly upper class Maderistas, including his wife for the post in the treasury. He also maintained the existing federal system, by keeping the sitting judges of the Supreme Court, the legislators in federal and state assemblies and the bureaucrats of the various federal agencies. Venustiano Carranza, who was going to become a major revolutionary in his own right and a future president of Mexico, stated that, after the treaty, Madero had [...] "deliver(ed) to the reactionaries a dead revolution which will have to be fought over again". D√≠az, after leaving for exile in France, observed that [...] "Madero has unleashed a tiger, <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>see</b> if he can control him".|$|E

500|$|Hersey {{began by}} making himself {{familiar}} {{with the work of}} writers already in the market who were capable of producing the kind of material Ralston wanted. [...] He soon concluded that the new magazine would have to include some reprinted stories alongside the original material. [...] The budget did not permit Hersey to pay rates that would attract top-quality writers, nor even to reprint the best-known stories of the kind he was looking for, and he was forced to use relatively unknown authors such as Perley Poore Sheehan and Robert W. Sneddon. [...] Hersey distributed a [...] "Notice to Writers" [...] that described what he was looking for: [...] "strange, bizarre, occult, mysterious tales... mystic happenings, weird adventures, feats of leger-de-main, spiritualism, et cetera... If you have an idea which you have considered too bizarre to write, too weird or strange, <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>see</b> it." [...] This did not restrict the submissions to fantasy or science fiction, and as a result Hersey received (and printed) all kinds of fiction, including mysteries, adventures, and love stories, though it may be that he simply did not receive enough good quality science fiction and fantasy to fill the magazine. [...] Hersey later recalled that the notice did not bring in many usable manuscripts: [...] "As a result of the notices in the writers' magazines, I received a thousand manuscripts but was able to buy only ten!" ...|$|E
500|$|Mendelson {{called the}} trailer [...] "a {{textbook}} case for unnecessary second pitches...Is there anyone {{out there who}} watched that first teaser back in December and said 'Hmm, it looks good and all, but I need more evidence'?" [...] He added that he was [...] "a little disappointed by the big Spider-Man reveal," [...] having previously wondered, after a Spider-Man character poster was not released with the others, if Marvel would have the [...] "courage" [...] to not include the character in any marketing materials before the film's release, letting the [...] "Peter Parker scenes the film has to offer be something that is a surprise for theatrical moviegoers and/or something that drives post-opening weekend buzz". Mendelson's colleague at Forbes Mark Hughes felt differently, noting that the trailer was targeting the general audience rather than just fans by giving [...] "us more explanation [...] of why a clearly major battle is raging between Captain America and Iron Man", and by including Spider-Man since [...] "there are plenty of surprises in these movies, and since we all already know Spider-Man is in Civil War, refusing to <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>see</b> him would frankly be a bit weird and pointless ... it's common for average filmgoers to hear some final bit of information or see some final image and feel compelled, inspired, or otherwise driven {{to go out to}} the movies that day. There are any number of factors that can come into play...and the world needed to see [...] because it‚Äôs the sort of value-added element that can make [...] difference". Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the Spider-Man reveal [...] "alone makes the trailer", describing it as feeling [...] "like the comic book character come to life. That awkward, voice-cracking, 'hey everyone' was as humble, playing-it-cool and cocky as he should be." ...|$|E

2500|$|Proof. Let S be {{the set of}} {{all natural}} numbers for which P(n) is false. [...] <b>Let</b> <b>us</b> <b>see</b> what happens if one asserts that S is nonempty. [...] Well-ordering tells us that S has a least element, say t. [...] Moreover, since P(0) is true, t is not 0. [...] Since every natural number is either zero or some nnbsp&+nbsp&1, there is some natural number n such that nnbsp&+nbsp&1nbsp&=nbsp&t. [...] Now n is less than t, and t is the least element ofnbsp&S. [...] It follows that n is not in S, and so P(n) is true. [...] This means that P(nnbsp&+nbsp&1) is true, and so P(t) is true. [...] This is a contradiction, since t was innbsp&S. [...] Therefore, S is empty.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the counterattack, voices {{could be}} heard on {{loudspeakers}} at the shrines of Abbas and Hussein, directing orders for the insurgency to attack the Republican Guard. In the closing days of the uprising, the shrines were heavily damaged by artillery and rocket fire from helicopters. Many rebels and their civilian sympathizers barricaded themselves into the buildings. Video recordings show the people dancing in euphoria and calling for the aid of America and Iran, which never came. Once the loyalist forces surrounded the shrine, {{the leader of the}} assault and a henchman of Saddam, Kamal Hussein Majid, stood on a tank and shouted: [...] "Your name is Hussein and so is mine. <b>Let</b> <b>us</b> <b>see</b> who is stronger now." [...] He then gave the order to open fire on the shrine. After blowing down the doors, the Guard rushed in and killed a majority of those inside with automatic weapons fire.|$|E

2500|$|According to James, {{the story}} must [...] "put the reader into the {{position}} of saying to himself, 'If I'm not very careful, something of this kind may happen to me!'" [...] He also perfected the technique of narrating supernatural events through implication and suggestion, letting his reader fill in the blanks, and focusing on the mundane details of his settings and characters in order to throw the horrific and bizarre elements into greater relief. He summed up his approach in his foreword to the anthology Ghosts and Marvels (Oxford, 1924): [...] "Two ingredients most valuable in the concocting of a ghost story are, to me, the atmosphere and the nicely managed crescendo. ... Let us, then, be introduced to the actors in a placid way; <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>see</b> them going about their ordinary business, undisturbed by forebodings, pleased with their surroundings; and into this calm environment let the ominous thing put out its head, unobtrusively at first, and then more insistently, until it holds the stage." ...|$|E
2500|$|Refusing to {{participate}} in what he felt was a farcical trial, Wali Khan did not take part in his own legal defence. In response {{to one of the}} charges before the Hyderabad Tribunal, that he had been sent Rs 20 million by Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi through a certain emissary, Wali Khan sarcastically filed a civil suit against the emissary for the recovery of the Rs 20 million. He argued that, although he could not imagine why Indira Gandhi would send him such a large sum of money, he had never received the money, and obviously the emissary had embezzled the money. As civil unrest was widely spread the country, the power struggle between PNA, Pakistan Armed Forces and Bhutto, including his colleagues, was triggered and, Wali Khan saw Bhutto's actions as his last stand. In an open public seminar, Wali Khan quoted that [...] "There is one possible grave for two people ... <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>see</b> who gets in first".|$|E
