So, for me, spirituality is what to do about that, and then what to do in your own personal life when you're confronting things that hurt, things that ain't fun. Outlasting the Blues was about that.

He travels across the United States and pits two bar owners {{against each other}} {{to see who can}} turn the most profit. But the twist is they have to run each other's bars for a night. How the show works is Mandel {{introduces}} each bar owner. Each owner then gets to talk a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> their bar offers and how they run things. Then the owners travel to each other's bars to spend a week there and meet the staff.

Later on during the week, the owners [...] "take over" [...] the establishment and implement their rules and TV viewers observe how the staff reacts to these changes. Many times, there is friction between the staff and the owners at this stage in the competition.

Finally, there is the [...] "relaunch" [...] night where the owner has complete control of the bar. This is the night that counts towards the profit totals which will determine who wins the competition. The winner receives a $10,000 grand prize.|$|E
50|$|Opinion {{leaders are}} {{the first step in}} the {{elements}} of persuasion. This is most important to the pre-purchase experience when a consumer is most interested in the marketing of the product they are intending to buy. The power of the persuasion that the opinion leader possesses will change depending on many different factors. The first is their credibility, this also works in turn with perceived trustworthiness. Consumers are more likely to believe that the campaign is genuine if the opinion leader is someone who has a reputation for being honest and credible. Another factor is their expertise in that field, although they don't have to be at an opinion formers level of expertise, any previous actions, study or jobs that may help the consumer believe that they do know a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> they are promoting, also helps with the authenticity of the advert. For some, the more superficial values hold the most weight in persuasion so the mere fact that the OL is attractive is a key for them, also their social standing not only effects the reach of promotion, but also can attribute to the persuasiveness. People who are the most effected by opinion leaders are those who are often engaged under the peripheral route. The peripheral route is less analytical of the actual product at hand, but will be persuaded due to other factors including an opinion leader that the consumer likes, or attractive elements of the packaging. Whereas those who undertake the central route of persuasion are less affected by these often superficial features and are more likely to choose an option based on the merits of the products or the strength of the argument.|$|E

He also said that if the series wasn't picked up for a ninth season he was happy with how his characters story was wrapped up. Lafferty opted out of returning for the ninth, and final, season as a full-time cast member. Instead, he appeared in 7 out of the thirteen episodes picked up, but continued as a series regular. After some time of speculation, James Lafferty signed on for one extra episode, which was the series finale.|$|R

500|$|A {{significant}} {{moment in}} the character's story came when Clark decided to play football in season four, providing conflict {{between him and his}} father. Writer Darren Swimmer refers to this moment as a [...] "... callback to ..." [...] in season one. To him, when Clark defies Jonathan and joins the team anyway, it signified the moment where Jonathan finally decided that he can trust Clark to not hurt anyone. Writer Todd Slavkin viewed it as Clark finally emerging from his father's shadow. Two more significant moments came during the following season. First, Clark lost his powers when he failed to return to Jor-El to finish his training; leaving him human and vulnerable. According to Welling, [...] "... learned a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more <b>about</b> <b>what</b> it's like to be human, physically. Emotionally, he's pretty close to trying to understand that. It added more weight to his abilities once he got them back, and it made him realize his responsibilities for what he has." [...] The second moment came in the show's 100th episode, with the death of Clark's adoptive father. The decision to kill Jonathan was made so that Clark could finally step into his destiny, allowing Clark the boy to become Clark the man, as explained by Gough. In order to do that he needed his mentor to die, so that no one would buffer him from the world any longer. Welling saw the series' 100th episode as the chance for his character to evolve and grow. John Schneider saw the same catalyst for Clark's evolution. According to Schneider, Jonathan's death inspired Clark to make the move toward his eventual destiny. Jonathan provided such an example of sacrifice that it leaves a void in Clark. To fill that void Clark would have to become Superman. It was Schneider's contention that had Jonathan not been the man he was, when the time came that the world needed Superman, Clark would have been unable to take on that persona, because he would not realize that the world needed him.|$|R

40|$|From weed to cash crop: Amaranth Marion Nduta Ng?ang?a Moi University, Kenya Suggested {{introduction}} For a long time, amaranth {{has been}} considered as a stubborn weed in farmers? fields and food for the poor during hungry times. But now this neglected but nutritious plant is becoming an important cash crop. Because {{it is now a}} good earner, farmers want to know how they can get the best yields of amaranth. A study carried out {{in the western part of}} Kenya, has shown that planting amaranth with soybean, both increases fresh leaf yields and improves the quality of the soil. Talking with Pius Sawa at an international symposium on neglected plant species in Arusha, Tanzania, is Marion Nduta Ng?ang?a from Moi University in western Kenya. She begins by explaining that amaranth in Kenya has a long, long history? Track 7 In	?We introduce amaranth? Out	? the market price is quite fair. ? Duration	 3 ? 11 ? Suggested closing announcement: That was Marion Nduta Ng?ang?a talking about the bright future for amaranth in Kenya with Pius Sawa. There are many other crops like amaranth that are still neglected, not only in Kenya but the world over. Contact details: Marion Nduta Ng'ang'a Moi University, Department of Seed, Crops and Horticultural Sciences, P. O. Box, 1125, Eldoret, Kenya Email: marionnduta@yahoo. com Transcript Ng?ang?a	We introduce amaranth because it has been there from time immemorial but a lot of people do not know the goodness of these vegetables. Sawa	Tell me a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> amaranth, <b>what</b> are its qualities and what does it exactly do to a consumer? Ng?ang?a	Amaranth is a very old crop and originally it existed in Mexico but it was used for human sacrifice rituals, so it was banned until around 1972, when it gained a lot of interest in America. Sawa	It sounds interesting because amaranth in most parts of the country are counted as weeds? Ng?ang?a	Now most people do not know about the grain amaranth, they only know about the weedy types that grow in cattle sheds when it rains and they do not take it seriously because they say it is consumed by the poor. But recent improvement has been has been done on this existing vegetable or weedy amaranth by the Kenya Seed Company and now we have a new variety called Amaranthus dubius that produces grains as well as leaves. Amaranth is a very important crop especially in the health field for women and children, and it matures very fast. Within two to three months you have your crop ready. And the most interesting bit is that the more you pick the leaves the more the plant generates these leaves. So you have a long harvesting period. Sawa	So by intercropping amaranth with the soybeans, do you think you think are trying to put in some value so that people can appreciate its use? Ng?ang?a	The reason as to why we are intercropping is because, being a new crop we are promoting, we cannot ask the farmers to stop planting other crops and plant amaranth. So the idea of intercropping is just to make sure the farmer has their ordinary crop as well as trying out our new amaranth variety. Apart from harvesting a single crop in a season, you will harvest two crops and you will harvest amaranth a month before soybean matures, and that will increase the income level in the household, thus reducing poverty. Sawa	Do you like amaranth ? do you eat it? Ng?ang?a	Of course I do eat it! Among all almost all indigenous vegetables, it is among the best because it is not bitter. It is very soft, especially for people who are ailing or have sores in the mouth. Sawa	How do you like it cooked? Ng?ang?a	It is very easy to cook, you just steam for five minutes, just like spinach. It doesn?t take a long time to cook, you can steam or boil or fry, just stir fry. Sawa	So in summary you are saying amaranth is helpful in fighting poverty, in helping malnutrition. Ng?ang?a	Yes of course amaranth is high value, it is dual purpose. You can pick leaves for a long period of time and eventually harvest grains. These leaves are highly nutritious, the grains are super nutritious and also the market price is quite fair. End of track. Amaranth is widely regarded as an unwanted and stubborn weed, food for the poor during hungry periods. It is, however, a highly nutritious and tasty plant. Recently, the Kenya Seed Company has released an improved variety of amaranth which matures in just 2 - 3 months, has a long harvesting period and produces nutrient-packed grain as well as leaves. In western Kenya, the plant is now being deliberately intercropped with soybean, a practice which both increases fresh leaf yields and improves the quality of the soil...|$|R
