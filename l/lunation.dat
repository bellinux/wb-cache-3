25|$|A lunar series {{generally}} is written as five glyphs that {{provide information about}} the current <b>lunation,</b> {{the number of the}} <b>lunation</b> in a series of six, the current ruling lunar deity and the length of the current <b>lunation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The present era lunar {{synodic period}} is about 29.5305877 mean solar days or about 29 days 12 hours 44 minutes and 2+7/9 seconds. As a whole number, {{the number of}} days per <b>lunation</b> will be either 29 or 30 days, with the 30-day {{intervals}} necessarily occurring slightly more frequently than the 29-day intervals. The Maya wrote whether the lunar month was 29 or 30 days as two glyphs: a glyph for <b>lunation</b> length followed by either a glyph made up of a moon glyph over a bundle with a suffix of 9 for a 29-day <b>lunation</b> or a moon glyph with a suffix of 10 for a 30-day <b>lunation.</b> Since the Maya didn't use fractions, lunations were approximated by using the formula that there were 149 lunations completed in 4400 days, which yielded a rather short mean month of exactly 4400/149 = 29+79/149 days = 29 days 12 hours 43 minutes and 29+59/149 seconds, or about 29.5302 days.|$|E
25|$|This {{gives an}} error {{of only about}} half an hour in 687 years (2.5 seconds a year), {{although}} this is subject to secular variation in the length of the tropical year and the <b>lunation.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Lunations</b> of 31 (and {{sometimes}} 28) days occur.|$|R
2500|$|... 11 years = 136 <b>lunations</b> within 1.5 days, i.e. {{an error}} {{of one day}} in 7.3 years.|$|R
2500|$|... 8 years = 99 <b>lunations</b> (an Octaeteris) {{to within}} 1.5 days, i.e. an error {{of one day}} in 5 years; and ...|$|R
25|$|Many Maya Long Count {{inscriptions}} {{contain a}} supplementary series, which {{provides information on}} the lunar phase, number of the current <b>lunation</b> {{in a series of}} six and which of the nine Lords of the Night rules.|$|E
25|$|The gain in {{accuracy}} is 0.0010391634 day (89.78371776 seconds) over 19 years, or about 4.72546 seconds a year. However, this gain is illusory as Thandeikta achieves the gain by redefining the mean lunar month (<b>lunation),</b> {{which is then}} more accurate and the solar year, which is less accurate. The table below shows the solar years of both systems {{in comparison with the}} actual mean tropical year. Thandeikta is 0.56 second a year less accurate than Makaranta.|$|E
25|$|The Maya {{counted the}} lunations. This cycle {{appears in the}} lunar series as two glyphs that modern {{scholars}} call the 'C' and 'X' glyphs. The C glyph could be prefixed with a number indicating the <b>lunation.</b> No prefixing number meant one, whereas the numbers two through six indicated the other lunations. There was {{also a part of}} the C glyph that indicated where this fell in a larger cycle of 18 lunations. Accompanying the C glyph was the 'X' glyph that showed a similar pattern of 18 lunations.|$|E
3000|$|... [...]), {{begins the}} cycle of {{counting}} the months anew, most frequently in December. Successive months (or <b>lunations)</b> are numbered from 1 to 12 within the year.|$|R

5000|$|A {{century before}} Callippus, Meton had {{discovered}} the cycle in which 19 years equals 235 <b>lunations.</b> If we assume a year is about [...] days, 19 years total about 6940 days, which exceeds 235 <b>lunations</b> by {{almost a third of}} a day, and 19 tropical years by four tenths of a day. It implicitly gave the solar year a duration of [...] = 365 + [...] = 365 + [...] + [...] days = 365 d 6 h 18 min 56 s. Callippus accepted the 19-year cycle, but held that the duration of the year was more closely [...] days (= 365 d 6 h), so he multiplied the 19-year cycle by 4 to obtain an integer number of days, and then omitted 1 day from the last 19-year cycle. Thus, he computed a cycle of 76 years that consists of 940 <b>lunations</b> and 27,759 days, which has been named the Callippic cycle after him.|$|R
25|$|As shown, for instance, by the Sardica paschal table, it {{was quite}} common {{at that time that}} the Jewish calendrical year started before the equinox. In case the {{previous}} year had started after the equinox, two Passovers would be celebrated in the same solar year (the solar New Year was starting on March 21). Since the 3rd century this disorder of the Jewish calendar of the time was lamented by several Christian writers, who felt that the Jewish were often using a wrong <b>lunation</b> as their Nisan month and advocated the introduction of an independent computus by the Christians.|$|E
25|$|In other words, {{because the}} eclipse season (34 days long on average) {{is longer than}} the synodic month (one <b>lunation,</b> or {{the time for the}} Moon to return to a {{particular}} phase and about 29.5 days), the Moon will be new or full at least two, and up to three, times during the season. Eclipse seasons occur slightly shy of six months apart (successively occurring every 173.31 days - half of an eclipse year), the time it takes the Sun to travel from one node to the next along the ecliptic. If the last eclipse of an eclipse season occurs {{at the very beginning of}} a calendar year, it is possible for a total of seven eclipses to occur since there is still time before the end of the calendar year for two full eclipse seasons, each having up to three eclipses.|$|E
2500|$|A careful {{analysis}} shows {{that through the}} way they are used and corrected in the Gregorian calendar, the epacts are actually fractions of a <b>lunation</b> ( [...] , also known as a tithi) and not full days. See epact for a discussion.|$|E
25|$|The {{book ends}} with a brief {{discussion}} of astronomical and symbolic cycles used in the prediction of timed events, which includes mention of (primary) directions, annual profections, ingresses, <b>lunations</b> and transits.|$|R
50|$|This eclipse is {{the center}} of nine lunar eclipses in a {{short-lived}} series. Each eclipse in the series repeats after one semester (6 <b>lunations</b> or 177 days) occurring at alternating nodes.|$|R
2500|$|The {{solar and}} lunar {{corrections}} repeat after [...] centuries. In that period, the epact has changed by {{a total of}} [...] This is prime to the 30 possible epacts, so it takes [...] centuries before the epacts repeat; and [...] centuries before the epacts repeat at the same golden number. This period has [...] <b>lunations.</b> So the Gregorian Easter dates repeat in exactly the same order only after 5,700,000 years, 70,499,183 <b>lunations,</b> or 2,081,882,250 days. However, the calendar must already have been adjusted after some millennia because of changes in the length of the tropical year, the synodic month, and the day.|$|R
2500|$|The Maya {{counted the}} number of days in the current <b>lunation.</b> They used two systems for the zero date of the lunar cycle: either the first night they could see the thin {{crescent}} moon or the first morning when they could not see the waning moon. The age of the moon was depicted by a set of glyphs that mayanists coined glyphs D and E: ...|$|E
2500|$|If the epact {{of a year}} is 20, an ecclesiastical {{new moon}} falls on 31 December. If that year falls before a century year, then in most cases, a solar {{correction}} reduces the epact {{for the new year}} by one: the resulting epact [...] "*" [...] means that another ecclesiastical new moon is counted on 1 January. So, formally, a <b>lunation</b> of one day has passed. This next happens in 4199–4200.|$|E
2500|$|On Maya monuments, the Long Count syntax is more complex. The date {{sequence}} is given once, {{at the beginning}} of the inscription and opens with the so-called ISIG (Introductory Series Initial Glyph) which reads tzik-a(h) hab’ [...] ("revered was the year-count with the patron [...] "). [...] Next come the 5 digits of the Long Count, followed by the Calendar Round (tzolk'in and Haab') and supplementary series. The supplementary series is optional and contains lunar data, for example, the age of the moon on the day and the calculated length of current <b>lunation.</b> The text then continues with whatever activity occurred on that date.|$|E
2500|$|Callippic cycle: 441 hollow {{months and}} 499 full months; thus 4 Metonic Cycles minus one day or {{precisely}} 76 years of [...] days. It equals 940 <b>lunations</b> with an error of only 5.9 hours.|$|R
50|$|The lunar year series repeats after 12 <b>lunations,</b> or 354 days (shifting {{back about}} 10 days in {{sequential}} years). Because {{of the date}} shift, Earth's shadow will be about 11° west in sequential events.|$|R
5000|$|Callippic cycle: 441 hollow {{months and}} 499 full months; thus 4 Metonic Cycles minus one day or {{precisely}} 76 years of [...] days. It equals 940 <b>lunations</b> with an error of only 5.9 hours.|$|R
2500|$|Astronomical: Any correct {{correlation}} must {{match the}} astronomical content of classic inscriptions. The GMT correlation does {{an excellent job}} of matching lunar data in the supplementary series. For example: An inscription at the Temple of the Sun at Palenque records that on Long Count 9.16.4.10.8 there were 26 days completed in a 30-day <b>lunation.</b> This Long Count is also the entry date for the eclipse table of the Dresden Codex [...] which gives eclipse seasons when the Moon is near its ascending or descending node and an eclipse is likely to occur. Dates converted using the GMT correlation agree closely with the Dresden Codex eclipse tables. The Dresden Codex contains a Venus table which records the heliacal risings of Venus. Using the GMT correlation these agree closely with modern astronomical calculations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relation}} between lunar and solar calendar dates is made {{independent of the}} leap day scheme for the solar year. Basically the Gregorian calendar still uses the Julian calendar with a leap day every four years, so a Metonic cycle of 19 years has 6,940 or 6,939 days with five or four leap days. Now the lunar cycle counts only [...] days. By not labeling and counting the leap day with an epact number, but having the next new moon fall on the same calendar date as without the leap day, the current <b>lunation</b> gets extended by a day, and the 235 lunations cover as many days as the 19 years. So the burden of synchronizing the calendar with the moon (intermediate-term accuracy) is shifted to the solar calendar, which may use any suitable intercalation scheme; all {{under the assumption that}} 19 solar years = 235 lunations (long-term inaccuracy). A consequence is that the reckoned age of the moon may be off by a day, and also that the lunations that contain the leap day may be 31 days long, which would never happen if the real moon were followed (short-term inaccuracies). This is the price for a regular fit to the solar calendar.|$|E
2500|$|When the 19-year {{intercalary}} cycle was finalised in the 4th century, {{the earliest}} Passover (in year 16 of the cycle) {{coincided with the}} northward equinox, which means that Passover fell near the first full moon after the northward equinox, or that the northward equinox landed within one <b>lunation</b> before 16 days after the molad of Nisan. This is still the case in about 80% of years; but, in about 20% of years, Passover is a month late by these criteria (as it was in AM 5765 and 5768, the 8th and 11th years of the 19-year cycle = Gregorian 2005 and 2008 CE). Presently, this occurs after the [...] "premature" [...] insertion of a leap month in years 8, 11, and 19 of each 19-year cycle, which causes the northward equinox to land on exceptionally early Hebrew dates in such years. This problem will get worse over time, and so beginning in AM 5817 (2057 CE), year 3 of each 19-year cycle {{will also be a}} month late. If the calendar is not amended, then Passover will start to land on or after the summer solstice around AM 16652 (12892 CE). (The exact year when this will begin to occur depends on uncertainties in the future tidal slowing of the Earth rotation rate, and on the accuracy of predictions of precession and Earth axial tilt.) ...|$|E
50|$|The lunar year series repeats after 12 <b>lunations,</b> or 354 days (shifting {{back about}} 10 days in {{sequential}} years). Because {{of the date}} shift, Earth's shadow will be about 11 degrees west in sequential events.|$|R
5000|$|The {{event of}} a black moon is an {{artefact}} of how the Gregorian calendar or the seasons map onto <b>lunations.</b> There is no physical or geometric difference between a black moon and other instances of a new moon.|$|R
50|$|As in all ancient {{calendar}}s, the Germanic calendar {{before the}} adoption of the Julian one would have been lunisolar, the months corresponding to <b>lunations.</b> Tacitus in his Germania (ch. 11) writes that the Germanic peoples observed the lunar months.|$|R
60|$|At sea, septentrional, {{by night}} the polestar, {{located at the}} point of {{intersection}} of the right line from beta to alpha in Ursa Maior produced and divided externally at omega and the hypotenuse of the rightangled triangle formed by the line alpha omega so produced and the line alpha delta of Ursa Maior. On land, meridional, a bispherical moon, revealed in imperfect varying phases of <b>lunation</b> through the posterior interstice of the imperfectly occluded skirt of a carnose negligent perambulating female, a pillar of the cloud by day.|$|E
60|$|Meditations of {{evolution}} increasingly vaster: {{of the moon}} invisible in incipient <b>lunation,</b> approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed {{at the lower end}} of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis Maior) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles) distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in 1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.|$|E
60|$|Similarly with time. Astronomical {{periodicity}}, and the periodicity {{of animal}} and vegetable life, are simultaneously {{used in the}} first stages of progress for estimating epochs. The simplest unit of time, the day, nature supplies ready made. The next simplest period, the mooneth or month, is also thrust upon men's notice by the conspicuous changes constituting a <b>lunation.</b> For larger divisions than these, the phenomena of the seasons, and the chief events {{from time to time}} occurring, have been used by early and uncivilised races. Among the Egyptians the rising of the Nile served as a mark. The New Zealanders were found to begin their year from the reappearance of the Pleiades above the sea. One of the uses ascribed to birds, by the Greeks, was to indicate the seasons by their migrations. Barrow describes the aboriginal Hottentot as denoting periods by the number of moons before or after the ripening of one of his chief articles of food. He further states that the Kaffir chronology is kept by the moon, and is registered by notches on sticks--the death of a favourite chief, or the gaining of a victory, serving for a new era. By which last fact, we are at once reminded that in early history, events are commonly recorded as occurring in certain reigns, and in certain years of certain reigns: a proceeding which practically made a king's reign a measure of duration.|$|E
50|$|The {{information}} in the passage can be summarised as follows:The book ends with a brief discussion of astronomical and symbolic cycles used in the prediction of timed events, which includes mention of (primary) directions, annual profections, ingresses, <b>lunations</b> and transits.|$|R
50|$|After 19 {{years the}} <b>lunations</b> should fall {{the same way}} in the solar years, so the epact should repeat after 19 years. However, 19 × 11 = 209, and this is not an integer {{multiple}} of the full cycle of 30 epact numbers (209 modulo 30 = 29, not 0). So after 19 years the epact must be corrected by +1 in order for the cycle to repeat over 19 years. This is the saltus lunae (leap of the moon). The sequence number {{of the year in the}} 19-year cycle is called the Golden Number. The extra 209 days fill 7 embolismic months, for a total of 19×12 + 7 = 235 <b>lunations.</b>|$|R
25|$|However, about 5 or 6 <b>lunations</b> {{later the}} new moon will fall close to the {{opposite}} node. In that time (half an eclipse year) the Sun will have moved to the opposite node too, so the circumstances will again be suitable for one or more eclipses.|$|R
