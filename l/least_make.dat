5|$|One {{approach}} is to acknowledge that induction cannot achieve certainty, but observing more instances of a general statement can at <b>least</b> <b>make</b> the general statement more probable. So the chicken would be right to conclude from all those mornings that it is likely the farmer will come with food again the next morning, even if it cannot be certain. However, there remain difficult questions about what precise probability any given evidence justifies putting on the general statement. One way out of these particular difficulties is to declare that all beliefs about scientific theories are subjective, or personal, and correct reasoning is merely about how evidence should change one's subjective beliefs over time.|$|E
5|$|Ray {{followed}} Apur Sansar with Devi (The Goddess), a film {{in which}} he examined the superstitions in Hindu society. Sharmila Tagore starred as Doyamoyee, a young wife who is deified by her father-in-law. Ray was worried that the censor board might block his film, or at <b>least</b> <b>make</b> him re-cut it, but Devi was spared. In 1961, on the insistence of Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Ray was commissioned to make a documentary on Rabindranath Tagore, {{on the occasion of}} the poet's birth centennial, a tribute to the person who likely most influenced Ray. Due to limited footage of Tagore, Ray faced the challenge of making a film out of mainly static material. He said that it took as much work as three feature films.|$|E
25|$|In 1885 {{the family}} left Arvier {{to work on}} the other side of the Alps, as most Valdotainians did at that time. The wish for a better life is a likely {{explanation}} but does not suggest why they travelled so far, almost to the Belgian border. Speculation surrounds the move, possibly because it was in secret. To emigrate needed authority and mayors had been told by the sub-prefect of Aoste to refuse or at <b>least</b> <b>make</b> permission difficult. If the family travelled separately, it would explain the legend that Maurice, then 14, was exchanged for a round of cheese: it could have been payment to a guide to lead him clandestinely over the mountains or payment in return for custody of the son.|$|E

Film critic Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote, [...] "Crystal sparkled {{as the host}} of the annual awards at the Shrine Auditorium."

[...] Chicago Tribune columnist Steve Johnson commented, [...] "Billy Crystal returned as host of the Academy Awards on Monday night and proved that even if mainline Hollywood is nearly shut out in the trophy dispensing, one of its representatives can at <b>least</b> <b>make</b> a television broadcast entertaining." [...] Television critic Kinney Littlefield of the Orange County Register quipped, [...] "In his fifth stint as host, Crystal served up the sense of inclusive, insider movie community that had been missing during his three-year absence." [...] In addition, she observed, [...] "For most of the evening, Oscar seemed newly energized, upbeat and full of splashy fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite her {{popularity}} with the viewers, Carmella was negatively received by Ruth Deller of television website Lowculture.

Deller also said she would have rather seen Carmella and Marco leave the show instead of Rosetta and Frazer. The Liverpool Daily Post said that they had seen implausible storylines in the serial, but Carmella seeing Marco's ghost [...] "takes the biscuit". However, they concluded [...] "At least he offers Carmella some much-needed support." [...] The Daily Record said the ghost scenes were more unforgettable than Bouncer's dream. On the subject of her funeral song they added: [...] "Oddly, none of her friends think she's gone mad, despite an impromptu version of 'Amazing Grace'." [...] Readers of Inside Soap were asked who Oliver should be with out of Carmella and Elle. Carmella came first with sixty-six percent of the vote.|$|E

500|$|In 2000, Lundgren {{starred in}} The Last Warrior as Captain Nick Preston under {{director}} Sheldon Lettich. This post apocalyptic movie {{is set in}} 2006 {{in the context of}} a 9.5-magnitude earthquake which kills millions of people, with Preston leading a motley military patrol on the island to help survivors in the pole shift-affected world. The film was partly shot in Eilat, Israel. Later in 2000, Dolph appeared in Damian Lee's Agent Red (also known as Captured), alongside Alexander Kuznetsov, Natalie Radford and Randolph Mantooth. The film is set during the Cold War, and is about two soldiers trapped on a submarine with a group of terrorists who plan to use a chemical weapon against the United States. Lundgren's character, Matt Hendricks, must work with his wife, a virologist, to prevent the scenario occurring. After the film was completed, producer Andrew Stevens thought it was too poor to be released and multiple people had to be hired to at <b>least</b> <b>make</b> the film half-competent. The film was very poorly received, given its [...] "shoestring budget"; the DVD and Film Guide of 2005 wrote, [...] "low-budget mess stars Dolph Lundgren as a navy special operations commander trying to keep a deadly virus out of the hands of terrorists. This subpar effort sinks to the bottom of the ocean in a tidal wave of cliche." [...] During an interview on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in May 2008, Gladiator director Ridley Scott said Lundgren had been considered for the part of undefeated fighter Tigris of Gaul in 2000, but was eventually rejected because [...] "as an actor, he just didn't fit in with what we were trying to achieve".|$|E

50|$|Characteristically {{the state}} functionaries (royal dynasties, soldiers, scribes, servants, administrators, lawyers, tax collectors, {{religious}} authorities etc.) are mainly not self-supporting, but rather materially supported and financed by taxes and tributes contributed {{by the rest}} of the working population.

2500|$|In {{order to}} ensure {{acceptance}} of his peace plan, Grey proposed a [...] "Stop in Belgrade" [...] offer, in which Austria would occupy Belgrade and go no further. Since {{this was the same}} proposal as Wilhelm had made, Bethmann Hollweg regarded this as a particular threat as it would have made it difficult for Germany to reject it. Bethmann Hollweg asked that Austria at <b>least</b> <b>make</b> an effort to show some interest in the British peace plan. In an effort to sabotage Bethmann Hollweg’s offer (which though not sincere was regarded as dangerous in case it might succeed), Moltke asked Vienna not to consider the British peace plan, and instead to order general mobilization and activate War Plan R, the Austrian war plan for a war against Russia.|$|E
2500|$|From {{his capture}} of Winchester and the {{surrender}} of its Castle on 5 October, Cromwell marched to Basing House, to which Colonel John Dalbier—an old German officer who had served under Duke of Buckingham, and had been equally ready to drill the Parliamentary troops—had for some weeks been laying siege. Cromwell arrived on 8 October 1645, bringing with him a siege-train of five demi-cannons (32-pounders) and a 63-pounder cannon. It was through the possession of siege-guns that he hoped to win his way where {{so many of his}} predecessors in command had failed. On 11 October when he was ready to open fire, he summoned the garrison to surrender. The defenders of the noble mansion of the Catholic Marquis of Winchester, were not the professional soldiers to whom Cromwell was always ready to give honourable quarter. They had, so at least ran his accusation, been evil neighbours to the country people. Their house was [...] "a nest of Romanists", who, of all men, could <b>least</b> <b>make</b> good their claim to wage war against the Parliament. If they refused quarter now, it would not be offered to them again.|$|E
2500|$|Australia won the toss at Sydney {{and decided}} to bat. Without Bradman, who was ill, they {{struggled}} against the pace of Harold Larwood and Bill Voce but, thanks to a brilliant innings of 187 not out by Stan McCabe, they made a creditable 360. England's batsmen had no such troubles and steadily built a total of 524 to claim a first innings lead of 164. [...] Sutcliffe opened with Wyatt and they began with a stand of 112. Wyatt was dismissed for 38 and Sutcliffe then put on [...] 188 for the second wicket with Hammond, who was out at 300–2 for 112. Next man in was Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi and he joined Sutcliffe in a third wicket century partnership of 123 before Sutcliffe was finally out for 194 after batting for over 7 hours across {{the second and third}} days of the match. The last seven wickets fell for the addition of only 101 more runs. With Larwood taking his second five-wicket haul, Australia could only make 164 to tie the scores and at <b>least</b> <b>make</b> England bat again. Australia was 164–9 at close of play on the fourth day so all that was required on the last day was for Voce to dismiss Bill O'Reilly off the third ball of the morning, without adding to the total, and then Sutcliffe himself to score the solitary run needed to complete an emphatic 10 wicket victory. Wisden recorded that [...] "there were less than a hundred people present to see the finish".|$|E

2500|$|After the 1955 general election, Attlee {{retired as}} leader. Bevan contested the {{leadership}} against both Morrison and Labour right-winger Hugh Gaitskell, {{but it was}} Gaitskell who emerged victorious. Bevan's remark that [...] "I know {{the right kind of}} political Leader for the Labour Party is a kind of desiccated calculating machine" [...] was assumed to refer to Gaitskell, although Bevan denied it (commenting upon Gaitskell's record as Chancellor of the Exchequer as having [...] "proved" [...] this). However, Gaitskell was prepared to make Bevan Shadow Colonial Secretary, and then Shadow Foreign Secretary in 1956. Bevan was as critical of the Egyptian dictator Colonel Nasser's seizure of the Suez Canal on 26 July 1956 as he was of the subsequent Anglo-French military response. He compared Nasser with Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves. He was a vocal critic of the Conservative government's actions in the Suez Crisis, noticeably delivering high-profile speeches in Trafalgar Square on 4 November 1956 at a protest rally, and criticising the government's actions and arguments in Commons on 5 December 1956. At the Trafalgar rally, Bevan accused the government of a [...] "policy of bankruptcy and despair". Bevan stated at the Trafalgar rally: We are stronger than Egypt but there are other countries stronger than us. Are we prepared to accept for ourselves the logic we are applying to Egypt? If nations more powerful than ourselves accept the absence of principle, the anarchistic attitude of Eden and launch bombs on London, what answer have we got, what complaint have we got? If we are going to appeal to force, if force is to be the arbiter to which we appeal, it would at <b>least</b> <b>make</b> common sense to try to make sure beforehand that we have got it, even if you accept that abysmal logic, that decadent point of view.We are in fact in the position today of having appealed to force {{in the case of a}} small nation, where if it is appealed to against us it will result in the destruction of Great Britain, not only as a nation, but as an island containing living men and women. Therefore I say to Anthony, I say to the British government, there is no count at all upon which they can be defended.They have besmirched the name of Britain. They have made us ashamed of the things of which formerly we were proud.
