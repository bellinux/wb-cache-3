40|$|In {{ecological}} studies, {{the goal}} is often to describe and gain further insight into ecological processes underlying the data collected during observational studies. Be- cause {{of the nature of}} observational data, it can often be difficult to separate the variation in the data from the underlying process or 2 ̆ 7 state dynamics. 2 ̆ 7 In order to better address this issue, it is becoming increasingly common for researchers to use hierarchical models. Hierarchical spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal models allow for the simultaneous modeling of both first and second order processes, thus accounting for underlying autocorrelation in the system while still providing insight into overall spatial and temporal pattern. In this particular study, I use two species of interest, the <b>lesser</b> and greater <b>scaup</b> (Aythya affinis and Aythya marila), {{as an example of how}} hierarchical models can be utilized in wildlife management studies.

40|$|A {{common goal}} in ecology and {{wildlife}} management {{is to determine}} the causes of variation in population dynamics {{over long periods of time}} and across large spatial scales. Many assumptions must nevertheless be overcome to make appropriate inference about spatio-temporal variation in population dynamics, such as autocorrelation among data points, excess zeros, and observation error in count data. To address these issues, many scientists and statisticians have recommended the use of Bayesian hierarchical models. Unfortunately, hierarchical statistical models remain somewhat difficult to use because of the necessary quantitative background needed to implement them, or because of the computational demands of using Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms to estimate parameters. Fortunately, new tools have recently been developed that make it more feasible for wildlife biologists to fit sophisticated hierarchical Bayesian models (i. e., Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation, ‘INLA’). We present a case study using two important game species in North America, the <b>lesser</b> and greater <b>scaup,</b> to demonstrate how INLA can be used to estimate the parameters in a hierarchical model that decouples observation error from process variation, and accounts for unknown sources of excess zeros as well as spatial and temporal dependenc...|$|R
5000|$|... <b>lesser</b> <b>scaup</b> females {{show the}} {{characteristic}} darker iris (bright yellow in greater scaup males and females) at closer distances. <b>Lesser</b> <b>scaup</b> drakes in nuptial plumage are often {{said to be}} recognizable by the purple instead of green sheen {{of the head and}} a darker back. But this is unreliable because it varies according to light conditions, and these birds are often too far away from the observer to make out any sheen at all. The best trait—if the primary remiges are not visible—is the shape of the head: in the greater scaup drake, the forehead is usually quite massive, whereas the nape presents a smooth shallow curve and may appear almost straightly sloping. The <b>lesser</b> <b>scaup</b> drake presents the opposite shape, with a less bulging forehead and a nape that looks strongly curved or even angular due to the small crest. When the birds raise their heads, these differences are most easy to spot, and after observing the two species in direct comparison it usually becomes easy to recognize. In fact, in alternate plumage the <b>lesser</b> <b>scaup</b> drake may appear identical in shape and size to a drake of the ring-necked duck (A. collaris); the black back and wings of that species are hard to confuse with the light ones of the <b>lesser</b> <b>scaup</b> male though.|$|E
50|$|Although the <b>lesser</b> <b>scaup</b> has {{the largest}} {{population}} of any species of diving duck in North America, their population has been steadily declining since the mid-1980s, and reached an all-time low in the early 21sh century. During breeding bird surveys, lesser and greater scaup are counted together due to the impossibility of identifying the species unequivocally when large numbers of birds are involved. <b>Lesser</b> <b>scaup</b> are thought to comprise slightly less than nine-tenths of the scaup population of North America. In the 1970s, the <b>lesser</b> <b>scaup</b> population was estimated at 6.9 million birds on average; in the 1990s it had declined to about half that number, and by the late 2000s it is estimated at 3 million individuals or less. Due to the wide breeding range {{and the fact that}} the rate of decline, though remarkable, is still not threatening in respect to the enormous overall numbers, the <b>lesser</b> <b>scaup</b> is classified as a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN.

We used Akaike information criterion (AIC) to select the model with the best balance of parsimony and goodness of fit that related indices of body condition with concentrations of Cd, Cu, Hg, Se, and Zn.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2004 To {{address the}} {{hypothesis}} that declines in recruitment were related to recent declines in abundance of <b>lesser</b> and greater <b>scaup,</b> I estimated variation in nest and duckling survival of these species at Minto Flats, Alaska (64 ° 50 'N, 148 ° 50 'W) during 2002 - 2003. I included nest survival data from two previous studies conducted during 1989 - 1993 in my analysis. Daily Survival Rate (DSR) of nests was variable within and among years and among habitats. Estimated nest survival of scaup ranged from 0. 02 (95 % CI: 0. 00 to 0. 06) in 1992 to 0. 61 (95 % CI: 0. 50 to 0. 74) in 1993. Predation was the primary apparent cause of nest failure, and flooding of nests was an important secondary influence. DSR of ducklings varied between years and increased with age of the ducklings and body condition of the brood female. Duckling survival to 30 days was: 0. 24 (95 % CI: 0. 16 to 0. 36) in 2002 and 0. 03 (95 % CI: 0. 00 to 0. 19) in 2003. I conclude that high temporal variability in production of scaup at Minto Flats was likely related to annual variation in the risks of predation and flooding and indicated that intermittent years of high production could be particularly influential to this population...|$|R
40|$|Studying {{long-term}} ecological studies {{allows for}} {{a better understanding of}} processes driving populations and communities, and this understanding can be used to improve conservation eorts. These studies can describe how changes in the environment have led to current states of populations and communities, and indicate if the current state or trend falls within expectations based on past dynamics. Studies of long-term datasets also help ecologists predict how populations may shift with climate, water, or land-use change and determine necessary management action to maintain sustainable populations and community interactions. Serving as a of time, 2 ̆ 2 long-term monitoring can provide insight into the in uence of predation, intra- or interspecic competition, and other interactions on system dynamics. Studies need to explicitly include these drivers and sources of autocorrelation in data (e. g., spatial autocorrelation) to obtain unbiased estimates of ecological processes for guiding management. Fortunately, new statistical analyses for ecological applications are available that help ecologists make full use of the information present in long-term studies while properly accounting for sampling error and autocorrelation. In this study, I use advanced statistical methods to analyze a long-term dataset, the Waterfowl Breeding Population and Habitat Survey, and address questions about waterfowl population and community dynamics. In Chapter 2, I use multi-state occupancy models to determine how the presence of <b>lesser</b> and greater <b>scaup</b> (Aythya anis and A. marila) has changed on their breeding grounds in North America since 1955. In Chapter 3, I use a Bayesian hierarchical model to determine the drivers of the breeding scaup population in the Northwest Territories of Canada. Lastly, in Chapter 4 I incorporate more waterfowl species into the hierarchical model from Chapter 3 to determine the drivers of the pochard duck community, along with the role of species interactions. My results indicate that the occupancy of scaup has decreased in the boreal forest of Canada and increased in the prairie parklands. Additionally, scaup in the Northwest Territories are largely in uenced by density dependence and snow cover extent. Finally, the pochard community in the Northwest Territories is regulated more by environmental drivers than intra- or interspecic interactions. These results indicate that management of the species through hunting regulations likely deserves further study, as scaup likely exhibit some sort of compensation in response to hunting...|$|R

50|$|The {{causes for}} this stark—though not {{threatening}} yet—decline remain unknown. There {{are indications that}} the breeding success is decreasing, but {{why this is so}} remains puzzling. On one hand, pollution and habitat destruction, especially in the wintering regions, has certainly increased since the early-mid 20th century. On the other hand, the narrow time frame in which <b>lesser</b> <b>scaup</b> breed and raise their young may be tied to some specific ecological conditions—such as abundance of key food items—which shifted winterwards due to global warming, without the ducks being able to adapt.
