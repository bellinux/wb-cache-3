5000|$|On systems where, {{for reasons}} of economy, the {{couplings}} are made non-reversible (e.g. by fitting the air brake pipe along {{one side of the}} car only), the use of a reversing loop will cause a proportion of the rolling stock to face the [...] "wrong" [...] way and it may not be possible to assemble a complete train in a depot, even if sufficient cars are on hand. This was the case on the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (now part of the Northern line of London Underground).

50|$|The ride {{begins with}} a right turn and then a 115-foot {{vertical}} 90° chain lift hill, {{this is followed by}} a 110-foot beyond vertical 97° first drop. Cars then reach a speed of 59 miles per hour at the base of this drop, pulling 4.5 G, cars then crest over an airtime hill, pulling -1.3 G. This is followed by an overbanked turn at an angle of 110° and a vertical <b>loop,</b> <b>cars</b> then rise up into a set of brakes. Cars then descend a small dip, into a heartline roll. The train then turns left with a slight incline then entering a double helix into the final brake run (which consists of magnetic brakes and fin brakes),the cars then turn right into the station.|$|R
5000|$|Looping/ Suspended Polyp — Originally {{designed}} by Wieland Schwarzkopf (son of Anton Schwarzkopf), the Looping Polyp {{was similar to}} the Monster, but featured cars that could flip over as well as spin (similar to a Mondial Shake ride). The cars were also suspended below the crosses, rather than above. The prototype, Sound Factory, built for German showman Kinzler in 1997, was the only Looping Polyp ever built, as the ride was plagued by mechanical issues and was pulled out of service just a couple years later. Around the 2008/2009 season, Gerstlauer of Germany replaced the original <b>looping</b> <b>cars</b> with spinning cars for showman Aigner, who currently travels the ride around to various German Funfairs under the name Parkour. As of March 2017, Gerstlauer still offers the Suspended Polyp.|$|R
50|$|A horse tramway {{was opened}} at Medellin in 1887. Horse-drawn trams began {{carrying}} passengers along Carrera 52, between Plazuela de la Veracruz (near Parque Berrío) and El Edén, on 23 January 1887. It was short lived, and ultimately closed in 1897.and later the it was planned for electrification. The Americans started electrification in 24 June 1920, and finally electric tramway opened in 12 October 1921. From Parque Berrío to América opened to traffic. Track gauge {{of the electric}} tramway was 914 mm / 36 in, the same used by the steam railroads. Routes were gradually constructed towards Sucre, Buenos Aires, Envigado, Belen, Berlin, Arenjue Hill etc. The entire network was single tracked (with some crossing <b>loops),</b> <b>cars</b> were single coach. In 1945 the network reached its maximum extent with 45 Kilometers of tracks with 61 trams.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the main}} drop, {{the cars are}} rotated 180 degrees so that riders are facing toward the ground. The train then enters an inside raven <b>loop,</b> where the <b>cars</b> are rotated again halfway through the loop to create a [...] "lie-to-fly" [...] maneuver; riders {{transition}} from laying on their backs facing backward to a flying prone position facing forward. After exiting the <b>loop,</b> the <b>cars</b> rotate backwards 360 degrees simulating a backflip. This {{is followed by a}} sweeping fan turn and a half twist [...] "fly-to-lie" [...] maneuver, in which riders flip forward 180 degrees to return to the original position of laying on their backs. Flame throwing special effects can be seen overhead as the train enters an outside raven loop immediately followed by another half twist. The track levels out and the train enters the final brake run before returning to the station.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of notable people from the {{amusement}} industry who have either worked with or have relations to Anton Schwarzkopf. His brother, Franz Schwarzkopf, was also a ride designer at around the same time as Anton, and designed many staples of the both amusement parks and carnivals alike, such as the Wave Swinger. His son, Wieland Schwarzkopf became involved with the industry as well, starting out at Schwarzkopf and later starting his own business in 1984. Wieland's company mostly provided parts and services for his father's rides, but had a few of its own attractions, such as the Sound Factory, a short lived version of the popular Monster ride with <b>looping</b> <b>cars.</b> Werner Stengel got his start with the Schwarzkopf company, and later went on {{to become one of the}} most prestigious designers of roller coasters and amusement rides. He was still heavily involved with most of Schwarzkopf's attractions. Hurbert Gerstlauer, founder and namesake of Gerstlauer Amuesment Rides GmbH, was an employee of Schwarzkopf before starting his own company in 1982. Gerstlauer's manufacturing is still done at the former Schwarzkopf facility in Münsterhausen, Bavaria.|$|R

From the opening of the Lechmere Viaduct leading to it in 1912 until 1922, {{streetcar}} lines simply fed onto the viaduct from Cambridge Street and Bridge Street (now Monsignor O'Brien Highway). In 1922 a prepayment station was opened, with a new loop for subway trains to turn around and a separate <b>loop</b> for surface <b>cars,</b> and no intermingling between the two. The surface lines have since been replaced with buses, but the Green Line still turns around at Lechmere.|$|R

50|$|The Pittsburgh Railways {{interurban}} {{line from}} Charleroi to Pittsburgh was opened through South Park on September 12, 1903, with passengers changing at Castle Shannon {{to continue their}} journey to Downtown via the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad. It was cut back to Library in 1953, with a turnaround loop for the single-ended PCC's that operated on the line. In the late 1980s, new light rail vehicles began to use the line. These new cars had larger, articulated bodies, and were thus unable to negotiate the <b>loop.</b> Moreover, these <b>cars</b> were double-ended, {{eliminating the need for}} such turn-around facilities. In 2004, the loop was removed and a new, larger station was built to better accommodate the light rail cars.|$|R

40|$|Neutrophil (polymorphonuclear leukocytes [PMN]) {{transepithelial}} migration during inflammatory episodes {{involves a}} complex series of adhesive interactions and signaling events. Previous {{studies have shown}} that key adhesive interactions between leukocyte CD 11 b/CD 18 and basally expressed fucosylated glycoproteins followed by binding to desmosomalassociated JAM-C are key elements of the transmigration response. Here we provide the first evidence that PMNexpressed junctional adhesion molecule-like protein (JAML) regulates transmigration via binding interactions with epithelial coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR). Experiments with a JAML fusion protein revealed specific binding of JAML to epithelial CAR expressed at tight junctions in T 84 cell monolayers and normal human colonic mucosa. Furthermore, JAML-CAR binding is mediated via the membrane distal immunoglobulin (Ig) <b>loop</b> of <b>CAR</b> and the membrane proximal Ig loop of JAML. PMN bound to immobilized CAR but not JAML in a divalent cation-independent manner. Lastly, in assays of PMN transepithelial migration, JAML/CAR fusion proteins and their antibodies significantly inhibited transmigration in a specific manner. Taken together, these results indicate that JAML and CAR are a novel pair of adhesion molecules that {{play an important role in}} modulating PMN migration cross epithelial tight junctions. These findings add a new element to a multistep model of PMN transepithelial migration and may provide new targets for anti-inflammatory therapies...|$|R
