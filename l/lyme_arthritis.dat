40|$|BACKGROUND: Lyme {{disease is}} {{diagnosed}} by 2 -tiered serologic testing {{in patients with}} a compatible clinical illness, but the significance of positive test results in low-prevalence regions has not been investigated. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients who tested positive for Lyme disease with standardized 2 -tiered serologic testing between 2005 and 2010 at a single hospital system in a region with little endemic Lyme disease. Based on clinical findings, we calculated the positive predictive value of Lyme disease serology. Next, we reviewed the outcome of serologic testing in patients with select clinical syndromes compatible with disseminated <b>Lyme</b> disease (<b>arthritis,</b> cranial neuropathy, or meningitis). RESULTS: During the 6 -year study period 4723 patients were tested for Lyme disease, but only 76 (1. 6 %) had positive results by established laboratory criteria. Among 70 seropositive patients whose medical records were available for review, 12 (17 %; 95 % confidence interval, 9 %- 28 %) {{were found to have}} Lyme disease (6 with documented travel to endemic regions). During the same time period, 297 patients with a clinical illness compatible with disseminated Lyme disease underwent 2 -tiered serologic testing. Six of them (2 %; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 7 %- 4. 3 %) were seropositive, 3 with documented travel and 1 who had an alternative diagnosis that explained the clinical findings. CONCLUSIONS: In this low-prevalence cohort, fewer than 20 % of positive Lyme disease tests are obtained from patients with clinically likely Lyme disease.

40|$|We have {{identified}} a 55 -kDa antigen encoded by a gene on a 49 -kb plasmid of Borrelia burgdorferi. The screening of a B. burgdorferi DNA expression library (N 40 strain) with rabbit anti-B. burgdorferi serum and then with serum from a patient with <b>Lyme</b> disease <b>arthritis</b> revealed a clone that synthesized an antigen that was reactive with both sera. DNA sequence analysis identified an operon with two genes, s 1 and s 2 (1, 254 and 780 nucleotides), that expressed antigens with the predicted molecular masses of 55 and 29 kDa, respectively. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that the s 1 -s 2 operon was located on the 49 -kb plasmid. Recombinant S 1 was synthesized as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli. Antibodies to recombinant S 1 bound to a 55 -kDa protein in lysates of B. burgdorferi, indicating that cultured spirochetes synthesized S 1. Thirty-one of 100 Lyme disease patients had immunoglobulin G (IgG) and/or IgM antibodies to S 1. IgG antibodies to S 1 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblots in the sera of 21 (21 %) of 100 patients with Lyme disease; 11 (27. 5 %) of the S 1 -positive samples were from patients (40) with early-stage Lyme disease, and 10 (16. 7 %) were from patients (60) with late-stage Lyme disease.

40|$|Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative {{bacterial}} {{agent of}} Lyme borreliosis, a tick-transmitted infectious disease. The Dutch Institute for Health Care Improvement (CBO) has now issued a guideline on 'Lyme borreliosis'. Lyme borreliosis {{is classified as}} 'early', 'early disseminated', 'late' or as 'post-infectious complaints and symptoms'. Erythema migrans {{is the most common}} manifestation of early Lyme borreliosis. Frequent neurological manifestations of 'early disseminated Lyme borreliosis' include meningoradiculitis, meningitis and peripheral facial palsy, but <b>Lyme</b> carditis and <b>arthritis</b> also occur. Late Lyme borreliosis is characterised by skin abnormalities (acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans), chronic neuroborreliosis or chronic arthritis. Confirmation serology with respect to Borrelia is the most commonly used laboratory technique, but in early Lyme borreliosis the immune response may be absent. In addition, the mere presence of antibodies in the serum is no proof of an active infection with Borrelia and serology may yield false-positive reactions.

40|$|Lyme {{disease is}} the most common vector-borne disease in the United States with over 20, 000 cases {{reported}} yearly.

While risk factors for Lyme disease are established, there have been no studies exploring risk factors for <b>Lyme</b> <b>arthritis.</b> To assess this relationship a cross-sectional study was conducted, using data from confirmed cases of Lyme disease reported to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) from 2000 to 2006.

The cytokine profile of synovial fluid T cells specific for NapA was investigated in 5 patients with <b>Lyme</b> <b>arthritis.</b> The cytokine profile induced by NapA in neutrophils and monocytes was also investigated. RESULTS: Serum anti-NapA antibodies were found in 48 % of the patients with <b>Lyme</b> <b>arthritis</b> but were undetectable in the healthy controls. T cells from the synovial fluid of patients with <b>Lyme</b> <b>arthritis</b> produced interleukin- 17 (IL- 17) in response to NapA.

40|$|Several {{quantitative}} trait loci regulating murine <b>Lyme</b> <b>arthritis</b> severity have been mapped, including a highly significant linkage found on chromosome 5, termed Bb 2 Bb 3. Within this region, the Ncf 1 gene of the phagocyte {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide}} phosphate (NADPH) oxidase has recently been identified as a major regulator of arthritis severity in rodent models of rheumatoid arthritis, an effect attributed to protective properties of reactive oxygen species. To assess the role of Ncf 1 in <b>Lyme</b> <b>arthritis,</b> we introgressed Bb 2 Bb 3 from severely arthritic C 3 H/He mice onto mildly arthritic C 57 BL/ 6 mice.

Furthermore, <b>Lyme</b> <b>arthritis</b> severity was not altered in mice lacking either the Ncf 1 or Gp 91 phox subunits of the NADPH oxidase complex.
