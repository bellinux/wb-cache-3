50|$|The Marine Accident Investigation Branch {{conducted}} {{an investigation into}} the accident, and a report on the investigation was published at the end of April 2008. Det Norske Veritas, the classification society responsible for the ship, also submitted its report at the same time. The accident was found {{to be the result of}} structural failure of the vessel hull skin and girders at the interface between the transverse stiffening of the engine room and the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffening</b> of the cargo area. This was due to the loading on the structure due to the ship, containers and the rare sea state exceeding the capacity of the hull girders in this area. No deficiencies were found in material or construction and the earlier grounding in 2001 did not contribute to the loss.|$|E
50|$|A {{suspension}} bridge works by hanging a roadway from cables or chains under tension. Though a few unstiffened {{suspension bridge}}s exist, a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffening</b> truss or girder is usually added to prevent excessive {{movement of the}} deck. The cables pass over towers and are anchored at both ends. Conventional suspension bridges use massive concrete or rock anchorages to resist the cable’s tension. In self-anchored suspension bridges, however, the cables are fastened to {{both ends of the}} longitudinal girders. These girders are therefore compression struts in addition to stiffening the roadway.Because each of Pittsburgh's Three Sisters appears to be a self-contained unit not dependent on the river banks for anchorage, a debate ensued among engineers whether these structures were cantilevers rather than suspension bridges. While current wisdom holds them to be the latter, the erection procedure shows how each bridge was built in halves toward the center. Temporary diagonal struts between chain and deck provided shear resistance turning each incomplete half into a trussed cantilever arm. These struts 'freed themselves' when the halves were jacked together and connected to form a suspension bridge.|$|E

MacPASCO creates input for PASCO, an existing computer code for structural analysis and optimization of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffened</b> composite panels. By using a graphical user interface, MacPASCO simplifies the specification of panel geometry and reduces user input errors, thus making the modeling {{and analysis of}} panel designs more efficient. The user draws the initial structural geometry on the computer screen, then uses a combination of graphic and text inputs to: refine the structural geometry, specify information required for analysis such as panel load conditions, and define design variables and constraints for minimum-mass optimization. Composite panel design is an ideal application because the graphical user interface can: serve as a visual aid, eliminate the tedious aspects of text-based input, and eliminate many sources of input errors...|$|R

For this purpose, three series of well executed experiments on <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffened</b> panel with rectangular opening subjected to the combined load have been selected as test models. The finite element analysis package, ABAQUS, is used for simulation with considering the large elasticplastic deflection behavior of stiffened panels. The feasibility of the numerical procedure is verified by a good agreement of experimental results and numerical results. More cases studies are executed employing nonlinear finite element method to analyze the influence of design variables on the ultimate strength of stiffened panel with opening under combined pressure.

40|$|Currently, the AISC code {{provides}} guidance for {{the calculation of}} the ultimate strength of unstiffened plate girder webs subjected to concentric edge loads. Specifications consider three categories: local web yielding, web crippling, and sideway web buckling. Based on previous studies, the presence of longitudinal stiffeners in the web has not been considered in the calculation procedures. Longitudinal stiffeners in steel plate girders are primarily used to increase bending and shear strength. In the last two decades, a number of projects regarding {{the positive effect of}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffening</b> on the strength of plate girder webs to concentrated load have been conducted around the world. The results have shown that this type of stiffening enhances ultimate strength for web crippling depending on the position of the stiffener that modifies the slenderness of the directly loaded panel; and flexural and torsional rigidities of the stiffener. This paper presents a methodology for the consideration of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffening</b> on the ultimate strength of plate girders webs subjected to concentrated loads. The methodology is based on the plastic collapse mechanism observed experimentally, in which plastic hinges are formed in the loaded flange and yield lines result in the portion of the web limited by the loaded flange and stiffener. Then, a closed-form solution accounting for the influence of the stiffener is developed following the current expression available in the AISC specifications. Theoretical predictions are compared with available test results, showing that the predicted ultimate loads are in good agreement with experimental results. Postprint (published version...|$|E

Firstly, some influence factors affecting the accuracy of the CMSM-of-SB including the boundary restraint regidity, the geometry and material parameters on the toe of the weld and its neighbor are analyzed using sensitivity method. Then, sensitivity-based model updating technology is adopted to update the developed CMSM-of-SB and model verification is carried out through calculating and comparing stresses on different locations under various loading from dynamic characteristic and static response.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} an analytical model {{to account for}} the effects of creep and shrinkage on the response of composite steel-concrete beams with partial shear connection stiffened by means of longitudinal plates bolted to the bottom flange of the steel member. The particularity of this model is that the partial interaction behaviour is assumed to exist between the top slab and the joist as well as between the joist and the bolted <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffening</b> plate, leading to a three-layered structural representation. The weak formulation of the problem is obtained and used to derive a 13 degrees-of-freedom element whose freedoms include the axial displacements of each layer, the rotations and vertical displacements at the end nodes.

40|$|Incremental {{launching}} {{is one of}} {{the common}} steel bridge assembly methods used nowadays, its practical application consists in passing the bridge assembly through the launching shoes as well as over each support pile. In some cases, when plate girders are used, it is usual to find longitudinal stiffeners reinforcement in order to prevent web local buckling produced by the vertical reaction acting in the support pile. A considerable number of studies have focused on evaluating the impact of a single stiffener on the resistance of plate girder subjected to patch loading. However, the effect of multiple <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffened</b> plate girders subjected to lengthy compressive load has received little attention. Therefore, this paper aims at studying the influence of load bearing length on the ultimate strength of multiple longitudinally stiffened webs subjected to compressive loads. Patch loading resistance is numerically calculated using a previously validated nonlinear finite element analysis. Subsequently, a parametrical study is conducted to investigate the effect of the aforementioned load length and the relative position and size of the stiffeners on the ultimate strengthPeer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R

The geometrical analysis of the main roof truss as well as the central longitudinal truss is based on logical dependencies and a description of a process in the truss design, pointing to evaluative relations resulting especially from the Pythagorean Geometry. Consequently, a spatial numerical model of the roof structure was developed in order to perform a static analysis of the roof structure in accordance with present standards. Due to the fact that during the diagnostic survey there were noted some missing structural elements in the roof construction (angle braces), in further analysis, an attention was paid to the importance of the selected structural elements and their role {{in the construction of the}} truss itself...|$|E
40|$|Some {{works in}} recent years were devoted to the {{investigation}} of failure mechanisms {{in view of the}} vulnerability assessment of historical masonry buildings and monuments. Shapes of collapse mechanisms were derived mainly by observation of damages of past earthquakes or, simply, by identifying weak structural solutions characterizing the typology under investigation. It seems that if sound damage scenarios have to be produced, more appropriate and quantified relations are necessary between structural behaviour and level of horizontal action, taking into account structural connections between intersecting walls. In earlier works, discrete systems of blocks interacting by non-linear springs were analysed with simplified plane models using a non linear finite element code (ANSYS).

40|$|In the {{construction}} of traditional composite bridges whose structure consists of plate girders, the concrete slabs of the decks are often casted before launching. These thin-walled webs are occasionally reinforced with longitudinal stiffeners to increase bending and shear strengths, and for bridges erected by incremental launching, these stiffeners also provide an enhancement for patch loading resistance. Experimental works have shown that ultimate resistance to patch loading is highly dependent on the size, relative position {{and shape of the}} longitudinal stiffener. Nonetheless, a comparison between those three factors should be carried out in order to establish the optimum configuration of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffening</b> for webs under compressive forces. Hence, this study attempts to compare the increase of ultimate strength of a slender I-girder subjected to concentrated load using open and closed section types of stiffeners, evaluating three different stiffeners configurations: i) a single open section stiffener, ii) multiple open section stiffeners, and iii) a single closed section stiffener. The nonlinear computations were performed using a finite element analysis parametric model, where the relative position and size of the stiffeners are varied to cover a wide range of geometries.

40|$|Conventional {{solutions}} for the equations of equilibrium based on the well known Vlasov thin-walled beam theory uncouple the equations by adopting orthogonal coordinate systems. This technique introduces several modeling complications and limitations where eccentric supports or abrupt cross-sectional changes exist (in elements with rectangular holes, coped flanges, or <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stiffened</b> members, etc.). In this study, a general solution of the Vlasov thin-walled beam theory based on a non-orthogonal coordinate system is developed. A finite element formulation, which yields nodal values in exact agreement with those based on the closed form solution of the Vlasov field equations and boundary conditions, is derived. The advantages and modeling capabilities of the formulation are discussed in detail. General expressions for normal and shearing stresses under non-orthogonal coordinate systems are developed. For design purposes, an elastic interaction equation for general open thin-walled section is derived. The shear deformation effect due to warping torsion {{is included in the}} torsional analysis of open thin-walled beams of general cross-section. The principle of stationary complementary energy is adopted to formulate the governing field compatibility condition. The variational principle is then extended to formulate a finite element, which captures shear deformation effects and allows the use of a minimal number of elements. For squat beams, shear deformation effects are shown to gain significance. Field equations and boundary conditions are obtained for the buckling analysis of thin-walled members by using the principle of stationary complementary energy. Subsequently a finite element is derived which incorporates shear deformation effects, a feature that is neglected in most available buckling solutions. It is shown that conventional solutions which neglect shear deformation effects can overestimate the predicted buckling load in some cases. The proposed finite element formulation can be used for the problems of column flexural buckling and torsional buckling, as well as beam lateral torsional buckling under linear moment gradients for doubly symmetric, mono-symmetric and channel sections. By adopting a non-orthogonal coordinate system, the solution is able to successfully capture load position effects relative to the shear centre. The efficiency and availability of the formulation is shown through comparisons to results based on shell finite element analysis solutions and other closed form or numerical solutions in the literature...|$|R

APPROACH AND RESULTS: Distensibility coefficient and Young's elastic modulus of the right common carotid artery were evaluated at baseline and after a mean (SD) of 9. 4 (0. 5) years in 2580 Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) participants. Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations were evaluated using multivariable linear regression and analysis of covariance. At baseline, participants were 60. 1 (9. 4) years old (54 % female; 26 % black, 20 % Hispanic, 14 % Chinese). Mean annualized 25 (OH) D was 65 pg/dL in 285 participants. In cross-sectional analyses, low 25 (OH) D (0. 4). PTH > 65 pg/mL was associated with stiffer arteries after adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors, other than systolic blood pressure (distensibility coefficient: β=- 2. 4 × 10 (- 4) mm Hg(- 1), P= 0. 003; Young's elastic modulus: β= 166 mm Hg, P= 0. 01); however, after adjustment for systolic blood pressure, these associations no longer were statistically significant. <b>Longitudinal</b> arterial <b>stiffening</b> was associated with older age (P 0. 1). CONCLUSIONS: Carotid arterial stiffness is not associated with low 25 (OH) D concentrations.

40|$|In {{torsion-box}} {{design of}} twin girder overhead cranes, the bridge rail {{on which the}} lifting unit runs is positioned eccentrically on the girder, directly above one of the web plates. This web is subjected to in-plane patch loading produced by the spread of a wheel load through the overlying rail and flange. This study concerns the load carrying capacity of plate box-girder web panels subjected to a wheel load at the midspan of the panel. Distribution of a wheel load through a rail and flange is investigated from recordings made of in-plane vertical stress distribution profiles along the upper edge of a web panel of a short-span model box-girder. The girder was loaded through various interfaces above the web by a wheel load. A simple method is proposed for relating a distributed wheel load to an equivalent uniform patch load. Methods for estimating distributed wheel loading lengths are investigated. It is shown that crane web panels are generally subjected to patch loads of short length, occupying less than one-quarter of the panel length. A computer analysis is presented to determine elastic buckling coeffic-ients for flat rectangular plates subjected to a uniform in-plane patch load centrally disposed on one edge and supported by shear stresses on the adjacent edges. Patch loads of various lengths are considered over a range of plate aspect ratios for plates with various combinations of simply supported and clamped edges. Also considered are some non-uniformly distributed patch loads modelling approximately a distributed wheel load. For {{the large majority of}} geometries considered, it is the support condition along the loaded edge which has greatest influence on the buckling load. Correlation with buckling loads estimated from experimental measurements on a model crane girder web panel indicated that an assumption of simply supported panel edges is over-conservative and that it is probably more representative to consider the edges attached to the flanges as clamped. Ultimate load carrying capacity is considered. A plastic mechanism analysis originally presented by Roberts and Rockey is studied and a modified form derived which reveals the transition region from collapse initiated by direct web yielding for girders with stocky webs to failure by a mechanism of out-of-plane web deformation for girders with slender webs. Certain approximations in the original analysis are shown to involve the omission of terms which can contribute significantly to the plastic work expression. Inclusion of these terms, however, whilst offering potential refinement, increases considerably the complexity of the analysis. Results are presented of a series of collapse tests conducted on short-span model box-girders subjected to a wheel load above one of the webs. The effect on the failure load of rail size, web thickness, panel aspect ratio, and <b>longitudinal</b> web <b>stiffening</b> is investigated. Snap buckling was exhibited by several of the test web panels. From the results, a simple expression is developed for predicting collapse loads of plate girders subjected to narrow patch loads.

50|$|Structures {{involves}} {{selection of}} material of construction, structural analysis of global and local {{strength of the}} vessel, vibration of the structural components and structural responses of the vessel during motions in seaway. Depending {{on the type of}} ship, the structure and design will vary in what material to use as well as how much of it some ships are made from glass reinforced plastics but the vast majority are steel with possibly some aluminium in the superstructure. The complete structure of the ship is designed with panels shaped in a rectangular form consisting of steel plating supported on four edges. Combined in a large surface area the Grillages create the hull of the ship, deck, and bulkheads while still providing mutual support of the frames. Though the structure of the ship is sturdy enough to hold itself together the main force it has to overcome is longitudinal bending creating a strain against its hull, its structure must be designed so that the material is disposed as much forward and aft as possible. The principal longitudinal elements are the deck, shell plating, inner bottom all of which are in the form of grillages, and additional longitudinal stretching to these. The dimensions of the ship are in order to create enough spacing between the stiffeners in prevention of buckling. Warships have used a <b>longitudinal</b> system of <b>stiffening</b> that many modern commercial vessels have adopted. This system was widely used in early merchant ships in the great eastern, it later shifted to transversely framed structure another concept in ship hull design that proved more practical. This system was later implemented on modern vessels such as tankers because of its popularity and was then named the Isherwood system. The arrangement of the Isherwood system consists of stiffening decks both side and bottom by longitudinal members, they are separated enough so they have the same distance between them ass the frames and beams. This system works by spacing out the transverse members that support the longitudinal by about 3 or 4 meters, with the wide spacing this causes the traverse strength needed by displacing the amount of force the bulkheads provide.|$|R
