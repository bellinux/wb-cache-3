5|$|The Andes prevent rain-bearing clouds {{from the}} Pacific Ocean from moving in, while its {{latitude}} {{puts it in}} a band of the sub-tropical high pressure belt keeping the region dry. Droughts are often frequent and prolonged. The Cuyo region {{is influenced by the}} subtropical, semi–permanent South Atlantic High to the east in the Atlantic, the semi-permanent South Pacific High {{to the west of the}} Andes, and the development of the Chaco <b>Low</b> <b>and</b> westerlies in the southern parts of the region. Most of the precipitation falls during the summer due to the stronger interaction between the Chaco <b>Low</b> <b>and</b> the South Atlantic High.|$|E

5|$|Aberdaron {{is noted}} for {{low levels of}} air pollution.

The climate is relatively mild and, because of the Gulf Stream, frosts are rare in winter.|$|E
5|$|After {{menstruation}} {{and directly}} {{under the influence of}} estrogen, the cervix undergoes a series of changes in position and texture. During most of the menstrual cycle, the cervix remains firm, and is positioned <b>low</b> <b>and</b> closed. However, as ovulation approaches, the cervix becomes softer and rises to open in response to the higher levels of estrogen present. These changes are also accompanied by changes in cervical mucus, described below.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the winds}} rapidly {{decreased}} after landfall, the storm maintained a well-defined structure as it crossed from Mozambique into Zimbabwe late on February22. Weakening to tropical depression status, Eline crossed Zimbabwe and maintained its circulation, entering Botswana on February24. Three days later, the center drifted into eastern Namibia {{and turned to}} the south, dissipating on February29. After the circulation dissipated, the residual system merged with a heat <b>low</b> <b>and</b> an approaching cold front.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on September 5 the North Koreans attacked. The {{engineers}} repulsed {{this attack}} but suffered some casualties. Ammunition was running <b>low</b> <b>and</b> three US C-47 Skytrain aircraft {{came over the}} area to make an airdrop. The planes mistakenly dropped their bundles of ammunition and food on the North Korean positions. Immediately after the airdrops, two F-51 Mustang fighter planes came over and attacked D Company, also in error. Soon after this aerial attack, North Korean troops attacked the positions.|$|E

There are four historic districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places within the city: Downtown Columbia, the East Campus Neighborhood, Francis Quadrangle, and the North Ninth Street Historic District.

A weak surface circulation was observed near 1900EST (0100UTC on July21) which was affected by an inverted trough as they turned westward. The system's circulation remained indistinct until July23 as winds of 22–30knots consorted with squalls adjacent to the coasts of Louisiana and Texas.|$|E
