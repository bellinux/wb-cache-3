40|$|AbstractThe paper {{demonstrates}} the profiles of electricity {{consumption in the}} <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>housing</b> sector using various time frames, and provides a solid basis for energy estimation by analysing actual 12 month electricity data from 60 comprehensively monitored <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>houses</b> in Australia's leading sustainable green village (Lochiel Park), located in South Australia. The results highlight that although considerable electricity reduction is achieved in <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>houses,</b> the outdoor ambient air temperature is still a highly influential factor that determines the total and peak demand in these houses. It also suggests that energy estimation should focus on residents’ basic life style and appliance usage behaviour.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Drawing {{from more}} than three decades of firsthand {{experience}} with designing and building passive <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>housing</b> in the United States for the hot-arid Sonoran Desert of the Southwest, the cold high plains of the Rocky Mountain West, and the hot-humid Piedmont of the Southeast, this paper evaluates how changes in the construction industry have restricted access to this housing type by would-be occupants. It describes how this lack of access has colored the behavior of these potential occupants to the point that when passive <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>housing</b> is provided there is little to no understanding of how it should be occupied. The paper then outlines the methods the author is using to change the behavior of future occupants of passive <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>housing</b> so they can better realize the full benefit the housing offers. Lastly, it describes how the design-build approach and the integrative design process are well suited for passive <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>housing...</b>|$|R

Bruno Erat built in 1978 the first low energy building in Finland. In 2010 a new <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>house</b> in Heinola Finland saved 70% in warming expenses compared to the equal average warming expenses. According to Mikko Saari (VTT 2004) a low energy block of flats in Finland would save 400 000-1 000 000 € in warming costs in 50 years with 3-6% annual energy price increase. There is an ongoing significant construction boom in Finland based on old and high energy demand construction standards since the energy cost payment is paid by the users and future generations but not the construction industry nor its leaders early retirement payrolls. The government strategy (published in 2008) had no aim to reduce the total energy use of buildings by 2020. Many construction companies operating in Finland have also business in Russia.|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} about the life and living in low energy houses in Finland. A new {{research}} framework is developed for studying this topic on large scale. This report tries {{to answer the following}} questions: Main question: what aspects are relevant for a research framework {{that can be used to}} study the behavior of residents in low energy houses? Sub questions: · What are the differences in types of low energy houses, applications and the use of these applications? · How have consumption patterns changed since people are living in a <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>house,</b> from the perspective of the user? · Does living in a <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>house</b> result in a rebound effect? · Does the extent of influence of the resident on the building process of influence the change in consumption pattern? · Does living in a <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>house</b> result in lower total energy consumption than living in a standard house? The newly developed research framework should answer the last sub question. In this report, a preliminary answer is given. Due to a limited amount of available literature expert interviews were first executed. During these discussions the experts provided useful literature, which is also been studied for this research. Five families filled in a diary during one week in the winter of 2006 / 2007. Also a questionnaire was administered. Afterwards an interview in their houses was held. The methods were mainly used for investigating the behavior of the residents, changes in behavior due to living in a <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>house</b> and use of the technical solutions that aim to decrease the energy consumption. The number of houses in Finland is increasing as is also the amount of energy used. The most important reason for that is an increase in the number of (small) households. Solutions to prevent or even counteract the tendency of increasing energy consumption are being sought. Low energy houses might be an appropriate solution. Information is lacking concerning the number of low energy houses built, however a new label system for energy consumption of houses that will be introduced in Finland in 2007 will likely clarify the situation. In the current report, information is given concerning the technical solutions implemented in the low energy houses: structure of the building (needs to be as simple as possible in order to decrease building costs, installing a more reliable heating system and increase energy efficiency), insulation, windows, lower floor, roof, heating and ventilation system (most important issue for Finnish low energy houses due to the low temperatures; these houses aim to decrease heating energy), heat pumps, fireplace, sauna, tap water, indoor air quality, solar energy and other appliances. Also the technical solutions installed in the houses of the respondents are discussed. It was unknown what the expectations about living in a <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>house</b> of the residents are. It was supposed that also other than ecological or sustainable living aspects were important, which can be summarized in better indoor air quality and financial aspects. It seemed that these were important reasons for the residents to choose for a <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>house,</b> however often they did not have any special expectations about living in a <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>house.</b> Building the house is a difficult task because designing is difficult, as well as choosing the building materials and technical solutions. Information concerning the interrelationships between different energy saving solutions and guidance from designers, constructors and suppliers is lacking. The residents in this study often relied on experiences in their field of action or from relatives. The use of the heating system and then the knowledge of the resident concerning how to use it optimally are essential for a good use. The residents paid much attention to choosing an appropriate system for the house and for their family from a user and energy efficiency perspective. In particular, the men in the families also devoted much attenti...|$|E

40|$|The UK’s {{existing}} {{housing stock}} is in urgent need of improvement {{in order for the}} country to meet climate change targets, provide decent homes and tackle fuel poverty. Around 25 % of UK’s greenhouse gas emissions come from domestic housing, a sizeable portion that will need to be reduced to achieve an 80 % cut in emissions by 2050. A recent survey by homeless charity Shelter found that four in ten British homes are not up to standard, and suffer from problems such as persistent damp and condensation which in turn can impact negatively on people’s health. Retrofitting the UK’s homes is an enormous challenge, given barriers such as lack of knowledge of retrofitting amongst the public, high capital investment costs, lack of policy support and demand drivers for retrofits, and potential disruption during retrofit works. The rate of new build properties meanwhile remains slow, and policy support for new <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> buildings especially has been diminishing in the past year. Taking a grounded theory approach and insights from sustainability transitions literature, this paper analyses the development of six <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>housing</b> projects in Brighton, UK. Using in-depth case studies based on document analysis and 17 semi-structured interviews, three whole house retrofit projects and three zero carbon new build houses are analysed in relation to key themes emerging in their development.

40|$|Receiving some of {{the highest}} levels of solar {{irradiance}} in the world, Australia is an ideal location for widespread implementation of solar energy technologies and smart buildings, designed {{to take advantage of the}} excellent solar resource. This thesis explores the concept of achieving a zero energy residential dwelling in the Sydney climate through energy efficient and passive solar design coupled with a photovoltaic/thermal (PVT) system. A simple house was modelled to determine the optimal values of the key design variables that would result in a low space energy consumption and low life cycle cost. The optimised <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>house</b> resulted in an annual space energy consumption of 252 kWh, representing a 94 % reduction compared with the NSW BASIX standard and requiring only minimal heating and cooling. Results for the best performing <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>house</b> models are shown to have a lower life cycle cost compared with a conventional brick veneer house model designed to meet the NSW BASIX building requirements. A PVT air system was investigated as an option for transforming the <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> <b>house</b> into a zero energy house with an emphasis on the winter performance. A holistic system design approach was used to design an experimental PVT air system that would maximise the thermal and electrical energy outputs and minimise the required fan energy. Simple and detailed theoretical models were presented as a physically meaningful representation of the PVT collector and provide a good match with experimental results. The optimum air flow rate range was determined to be 0. 04 - 0. 06 kg/s. m 2 which produced a temperature rise of 5 - 8 °C at midday for a typical sunny winter's day in Sydney. A unique result was achieved whereby the additional PV energy generated due to ventilation is in excess of the fan energy requirement. This was made possible through energy efficient hydraulic design using large ducts to minimise the pressure loss and selection of a fan that would produce high air flow rates at a low input power. The PVT system also demonstrated good potential for night purge ventilation cooling in summer. An affordable zero energy house in Sydney is therefore a very achievable goal with currently available building materials, energy efficiency measures and solar energy technologies...|$|E
