40|$|A PC-based {{measurement}} and control of liquid level {{is a very important}} part of the modern instrumentation system of a process plant in any process industry. In this {{measurement and}} control system, the liquid level is measured by using a suitable <b>level</b> <b>transducer.</b> Among the different types of level transducers for {{measurement and control}} of liquid level in storage tank the cheapest one is perhaps the float type sensor and the movement of the float with level is generally converted into the movement of a pointer or that of a flapper or that of a potentiometer. In all of these system float is connected with the output device through a mechanical linkage and thus the measurement is subjected to errors due to wear and tear, friction etc. at the mechanical linkage. Here a non-contact float & magnet type <b>level</b> <b>transducer</b> using hall probe has been described in the present paper. A control system has been designed by using thyristor driven pump as the final control element, the speed of which is controlled by the computer through an opto-isolator unit.

40|$|Natural {{hydrocarbon}} seeps in {{the marine}} environment are important contributors to greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Such gases include methane, which {{plays a significant role}} in global carbon cycling and climate change. To accurately quantify the methane flux from hydrocarbon seeps on the seafloor, a specialized in situ and online gas flux measuring (GFM) device was designed to obtain high-resolution time course gas fluxes using the process of equal volume exchange. The device consists of a 1. 0 -m diameter, 0. 9 -m tall, inverted conical tent and a GFM instrument that contains a solenoid valve, <b>level</b> <b>transducer,</b> and gas collection chamber. Rising gas bubbles from seeps were measured by laboratory-calibrated GFM instruments attached {{to the top of the}} tent. According to the experimental data, the optimal anti-shake time interval was 5 s. The measurement range of the device was 0 - 15 L min(- 1), and the relative error was +/- 1. 0 %. The device was initially deployed at an active seep site in the Lingtou Promontory seep field in South China Sea. The amount of gas released from a single gas vent was 30. 5 m(3) during the measurement period, and the gas flow rate ranged from 22 to 72 L h(- 1), depending on tidal period, and was strongly negatively correlated with water depth. The measurement results strongly suggest that oceanic tides and swells had a significant forcing effect on gas flux. Low flow rates were associated with high tides and vice versa. The changes in gas volume escaping from the seafloor seeps could be attributed to the hydrostatic pressure induced by water depth. Our findings suggest that {{in the marine}} environment, especially in the shallow shelf area, sea level variation may play an important role in controlling methane release into the ocean. Such releases probably also affect atmospheric methane levels...|$|E

40|$|A {{field study}} of {{cohesive}} sediment movements on a muddy intertidal zone (ITZ) at Portishead, Severn Estuary is presented. Five deployments of 1 - 3 days {{have been made}} to improve the understanding of temporal and spatial variations in suspended and bed sediments at a site which is found to be wave dominated. Pressure transducers, electro-magnetic current meters, optical turbidity meters and ultra-sonic bed <b>level</b> <b>transducers</b> are used to monitor the hydro/sediment dynamics in the bottom metre of the water column at two points on the ITZ. A one-dimensional (vertical) k-ϵ turbulence model has been modified to include bed sediment exchange and density stratification to enable further interpretation of field data. Modelling results show that the weak current on the ITZ would simply provide a mechanism for diffusing suspended sediment into {{the upper part of the}} flow, and does not enhance the wave boundary layer by its presence and cannot actively support suspended sediment. Hence near bed (wave generated) turbulence controls the vertical SSC distribution. A bed model based on bed sediment exchange via critical erosional and depositional shear stresses only predicts high near bed concentrations for some of the hydrodynamic conditions reflected in field data, suggesting hindered settling is an important factor in their formation. The introduction of density stratification reduces near surface SSC creating steeper SSC gradients in the upper half of the flow, for a weak current with waves...|$|R

The amount of the shipped water in the compartment has been kept constant during any single test but four different degrees of filling have been considered. To emphasize {{the effect of the}} free surface of the liquid in the container, the frozen liquid condition has been tested as well. The roll history has been recorded by the use of an inclinometer, while four <b>level</b> <b>transducers</b> inside the compartment and a videorecording setup have provided the sloshing history.

The dangerous frequencies are well captured and the predicted roll amplitudes and the free surface behaviour compare well with experiments.

Subjects performed 26 Earchecks that differed regarding presentation level (65, 71, and 77 dBA), presentation mode (monotic or diotic), and masking noise (two different low-pass filtered noises) in the lab.

Using loudspeakers deteriorated SRTs significantly in comparison to headphones, but only in hearing-impaired subjects.

This paper presents {{the design of a}} capacitance transducer using a 555 timer circuit measuring the capacitance in terms of frequency and interfaced to a microcontroller to provide an accurate level measurement system. The whole system was tested and calibrated with a standard graduated tank (5 - 95 %). The loading and unloading error percentages and the hysteresis error are determined and the maximum range to which the variation corresponds to is observed. The measurement quality of the system was further improved by linearization and the results are analyzed.
