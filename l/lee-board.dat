6000|$|... "That {{is to be}} hoped; {{for what}} would a man think of a fish to which nature had fitted a tail athwart-ships, and which was obliged to carry a fin, like a <b>lee-board,</b> under its lee-jaw, to prevent falling off dead before the wind!" ...|$|E
60|$|The Dutch galliot is a {{somewhat}} peculiar craft {{to the eye}} of an Englishman; heavy and clumsy-looking beyond doubt, but a good sea-boat notwithstanding. The galliot looks much the same, whether you regard her from stem or from stern, both being almost equally rounded. Keel she has scarce any; her floors are flat, hull broad and deep, and rudder very wide. Hung on each side is a large <b>lee-board,</b> {{to keep her from}} making too much leeway. Her hull is varnished a bright yellow colour, and shines in the sun. Her bulwarks are lofty; and a wooden house is placed aft, where the captain and his family live, and which is always kept brightly painted. This part of the ship is a remarkably snug place, comfortably furnished, and kept with the characteristic Dutch cleanliness and neatness. Forward is the caboose of the crew, a wide, low, but roomy erection.|$|E
60|$|Keels are {{troublesome}} to make: <b>lee-boards</b> {{are effective}} substitutes, and are easily {{added to a}} rude boat or punt when it is desired to rig her as a sailing-craft.|$|R
50|$|Kerry currachs had a {{reputation}} for elegance and speed. All were fitted for sailing, with a short mast without shrouds stepped in a socket in a short mast shoe. The halliard was rove through an iron ring near the masthead, hoisting a small lug sail, and this was controlled by a sheet and tack. When under sail <b>lee-boards</b> might be employed.|$|R
60|$|Rafts, as we {{have already}} remarked, must {{undoubtedly}} have been the beginning of navigation. But they have not, like many other species of ancient craft, been altogether superseded by modern inventions. True, we do not nowadays carry on war on rafts, but we still carry on trade with them {{in many parts of}} the world. How the rafts of ancient times were formed we cannot tell precisely, though we can easily guess; but one thing we know, and that is, that the first improvement made in such craft was the thrusting of a few thick planks down into the water, to the depth of three or four feet, between the logs which composed the raft. These acted the part of a keel, and, by pressing against the water side-ways when a side wind blew, prevented the raft from making much of what is called leeway--that is, drifting in the direction in which the wind happened to be blowing. Some sorts of Dutch vessels use <b>lee-boards</b> for this purpose at the present time.|$|R
5000|$|Attaching the {{two large}} bundles {{that form the}} gunnels or [...] "sawi" [...] is the last step of the hull construction. Rope is wound around each gunnel and passed through each main bundle rope {{along the length of}} the ship. The rigging will be {{attached}} here and the gunnels help break the larger waves.The crew and volunteers constructed the rest of the vessel. Two bipod masts were positioned on either side of a bamboo cabin for Viracocha I and a smaller mast was utilized further aft for the Viracocha II. The masts were held in place by [...] "shoes" [...] roped into the bundles. Two rudder oars were lashed to a steering platform placed above and to the rear of the bamboo cabin. The ship was rigged with natural fiber sisal rope, the same rope that holds the reed bundles together. Two center boards were positioned in the slide boxes placed in the fore and aft of the ship and aided in the tacking into the wind. Several <b>lee-boards</b> were placed on the lee-side of the ship and were removable. Two cotton Lateen sails were hand sewed for the first journey and 5 sails were used for the second.|$|R
60|$|As the {{movement}} of the ferry-boat was necessarily slow, the Alderman and his companion were enabled to step into it, before the fasts were thrown aboard. The periagua, as the craft was called, partook of a European and an American character. It possessed the length, narrowness, and clean bow, of the canoe, from which its name was derived, with the flat bottom and <b>lee-boards</b> of a boat constructed for the shallow waters of the Low Countries. Twenty years ago, vessels of this description abounded in our rivers, and even now, their two long and unsupported masts and high narrow-headed sails, are daily seen bending like reeds to the breeze, and dancing lightly over the billows of the bay. There is a variety of the class, of a size and pretension altogether superior to that just mentioned, which deserves a place among the most picturesque and striking boats that float. He who has had occasion to navigate the southern shore of the Sound must have often seen the vessel to which we allude. It is distinguished by its great length, and masts which, naked of cordage, rise from the hull like two tall and faultless trees. When the eye runs over the daring height of canvas, the noble confidence of the rig, and sees the comparatively vast machine handled with ease and grace by the dexterity of two fearless and expert mariners, it excites some such admiration as that which springs from the view of a severe temple of antiquity The nakedness and simplicity of the construction, coupled with the boldness and rapidity of its movements, impart to the craft an air of grandeur, that its ordinary uses would not give reason to expect.|$|R
