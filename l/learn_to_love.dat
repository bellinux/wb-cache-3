5|$|Beauty and the Beast is a 1991 American {{animated}} musical romantic fantasy film {{produced by}} Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The 30th Disney animated feature film {{and the third}} released during the Disney Renaissance period, {{it is based on}} the French fairy tale of the same name by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont (who was also credited in the English version as well as in the French version), and ideas from the 1946 French film of the same name directed by Jean Cocteau. Beauty and the Beast focuses on the relationship between the Beast (voice of Robby Benson), a prince who is magically transformed into a monster and his servants into household objects as punishment for his arrogance, and Belle (voice of Paige O'Hara), a young woman whom he imprisons in his castle. To become a prince again, Beast must <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> Belle and earn her love in return to avoid remaining a monster forever. The film also features the voices of Richard White, Jerry Orbach, David Ogden Stiers, and Angela Lansbury.|$|E
25|$|After dinner, Belle gets {{a tour of}} {{the castle}} {{courtesy}} of Cogsworth and Lumi√®re, her curiosity leads her to enter the West Wing, a place the Beast told her was forbidden. Mesmerized by a mysterious rose floating in a bell jar, she reaches out to touch it but before she can, the Beast stops her and orders her to get out accidentally shoving her in the process. Fearing for her life, Belle flees from the castle. Realizing his deadly mistake, the Beast knows he will be a monster forever if he cannot <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> her ("If I Can't Love Her").|$|E
25|$|On a cold winter's night, an old beggar woman {{comes to}} a young spoiled prince's castle, {{offering}} him a single rose in return for shelter. But the prince turns her away solely for her appearance. The old woman warns him not to be fooled by appearances, as true beauty lies within, only to be rejected again. She then transforms into a beautiful enchantress and turns the prince into a hideous Beast and his servants into various household objects. She gives him the rose to use as an hour-glass. The only way he can break the spell is to <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> another and earn her love in return {{by the time the}} last petal falls ("Prologue").|$|E

25|$|A {{handsome}} young prince {{lives in a}} luxurious castle in France. He has everything he ever wanted, and as a result, he is spoiled, selfish and unkind. One night, his kindness is {{put to the test}} when a beggar woman comes to the castle and asks for shelter from the freezing cold, with a single rose as payment. When he shuns the beggar for her repulsive appearance, she then reveals her true form as a beautiful enchantress. Seeing her beauty and realizing her power, the Prince tries to apologize but she transforms him into a terrifying beast-like creature for his arrogance. She also casts a spell on the entire castle, transforming it into a dark, foreboding place, its lush green grounds into dangerous immortal wolf-infested woods, and the good-natured servants into anthropomorphic household objects to reflect their different personalities. Ashamed of his new appearance, the Beast conceals himself inside his castle with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world, and an enchanted rose that would act as the curse's timer which would bloom until he turns 21. If the Beast could <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> a woman and earn her love in return before the final petal fell off the rose, the curse would be broken, but if not he would remain a beast forever. The Beast turns to despair as the years pass by, with little hope of achieving this.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} of the English version of the anime stated that Naruto {{was the most difficult}} character to cast, adding that Maile Flanagan [...] "has Naruto down, from the mischievous side, that precocious twelve-year-old we <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>love,</b> to the serious side". Flanagan avoided listening to Junko Takeuchi's performance as {{she did not want to}} imitate it, stating she wanted to develop her own voice for the character. Her performance has been praised as showing Naruto's brashness and later growth in confidence. [...] In a 2014 interview, Flanagan claimed she had never heard of Naruto before her audition. She looked the show up after being chosen and felt the release of the English dub would be popular. She is recognized more for her work voicing Naruto than from other roles she has done in her career, although some fans did not expect that Naruto would be voiced by a woman.|$|E

On the day of the game, Marge takes Bart to an amusement park; while they ride the roller coaster, Lisa calls Bart to beg for his help, but he brushes her off.

Marge takes Bart to the game, which is now in its last inning with the Isotots down 11-10.

As he begins to steal home, Lisa realizes the odds are vastly against him, then decides to ignore the numbers and cheer him on anyway. He is tagged out at the plate, costing the Isotots their championship bid, but Lisa thanks him for helping her <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> baseball as a game, and the team cheers them for resolving their differences.|$|E

2500|$|Eliza Frances [...] "Fanny" [...] Andrews {{was born}} on August 10, 1840, in Washington, Georgia, the second {{daughter}} of Annulet Ball and Garnett Andrews, a Georgia superior court judge. [...] Her father was a lawyer, judge, and plantation owner, possessing around two hundred slaves. Andrews {{grew up on the}} family estate, Haywood, the name of which she would later use in a pseudonym, [...] "Elzey Hay". attended the local Ladies' Seminary school, and later graduated among the first class of students from LaGrange Female College in Georgia in 1857. She was well-versed in literature, music, and the arts, and was conversant in both French and Latin. Upon graduating [...] "Fanny" [...] had returned to live at home in the care of her family when the Southern states began to secede from the Union. Her father was notoriously outspoken against secession but, despite his views, three of his sons enlisted in the Confederate States Army and his daughters, too, believed in the rebellion. Thus, while Garnett Andrews refused to allow secessionist ideals to be voiced in his home, his daughters are said to have secretly made the first Confederate flag to fly over the courthouse in her hometown.
