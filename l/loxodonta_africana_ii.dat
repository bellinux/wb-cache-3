40|$|The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) regulates {{trade in}} species and their products. The {{original}} {{listing of the}} African elephant (<b>Loxodonta</b> <b>africana)</b> in Appendix <b>II</b> limited international trade, but their listing on Appendix I at the 7 th CITES Conference of Parties (CoP) in 1989 (CITES 1989) banned international trade (Stiles 2004). Tn 1997, the 10 th CITES CoP allowed sales of ivory from Botswana, Namibia and Zambia (CITES 1997) and the 12 th CITES CoP conditionally refined further sales by these countries in 2007 (CITES 2007 a). All these decisions relied on trends in numbers and poaching derived from the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS; CITES 2007 b) and Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants Programme (MIKE; CITES 2007 c), Such information clearly ignores demographic and spatial variables that drive these trends in elephant populations. We propose that clusters of conservation areas are required as spatial and demographic units on which to frame CITES decision-taking processes for elephants, and suggest that information on the demographic profiles of sub populations within clusters should supplement census information from NIIKE and ETIS...|$|R

50|$|The North African {{elephant}} (<b>Loxodonta</b> <b>africana</b> pharaoensis) was the subspecies of the African bush elephant (<b>Loxodonta</b> <b>africana),</b> {{or possibly}} a separate elephant species, {{that existed in}} North Africa north of the Sahara until becoming extinct in Roman times. These were the famous war elephants used by Carthage in the Punic Wars, their conflict with the Roman Republic. Although the subspecies has been formally described, {{it has not been}} widely recognized by taxonomists. Other names for this animal include the North African forest elephant, Carthaginian elephant, and Atlas elephant. Originally, its natural range probably extended across North Africa and down to the present Sudanese and Eritrean coasts.|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} in the Waza National Park (WNP) from March to June, to monitor the behaviour of 9 mammals around the artificial waterholes named Anane and Louloumbaya. Observations were made all through the day. The frequency of observation visits to the waterholes was one per day and four times a month. The results showed three categories of animals in terms of food regime. The first group is represented by herbivorous, frugivorous such as <b>Loxodonta</b> <b>africana</b> Africana, Phacocheorus aethiopicus and Erythrocebus patas, the second group by represented by herbivorous like Giraffa camelopardalis, Hippotragus equines, Damaliscus korrigum and Gazella rufifirons and the third by group representing carnivorous like, Canis aureus and Herpestes hichneumon. Among these species, <b>Loxodonta</b> <b>africana</b> africana is the main consumer whereas Giraffa camelopardalis is the second in the Park. High temperatures reduce {{the activities of the}} animals during the dry season as well as the number of waterholes run off. Lack of water forces some animals to migrate to other localities and those which do not die in the course of time. February is the hottest month in the WNP where temperatures reach up to 48. 8 ºC. The mean number of the animal visits varies with the species and from one waterhole to another. <b>Loxodonta</b> <b>africana</b> africana was the most frequently seen species around the waterholes (47. 72 %) followed by Hippotragus equinus (16. 57 %) and Damaliscus korrigum (14. 77 %).

40|$|Vocal {{imitation}} in African Savannah Elephants (<b>Loxodonta</b> <b>africana)</b> There {{are a few}} mammalian {{species that}} can modify their vocalizations in response to auditory experience. We describe two examples of vocal imitation by African Savannah Elephants (<b>Loxodonta</b> <b>africana),</b> a terrestrial mammal that lives in a multitiered fission-fusion society. The first case of vocal imitation involves Mlaika, an adolescent female African Elephant {{who lived in a}} semi-captive group of orphaned elephants in the Tsavo National Park, Kenya. Trucks were audible from a highway 3 km from the night stockade. Mlaika emitted truck-like sounds for several hours after sunset, the optimal time for the transmission of low frequency sound in African savannahs. The second case involves Calimero, an adult male African Elephant who spent 18 years living with two female Asian Elephants (Elephas max-imus) at the Rome zoo. Calimero imitated the chirping sounds typically produced by Asian Elephants, though not by African Elephants. Our findings favour a role for vocal imitation that has already been proposed for primates, birds, bats and marine mammals: it is a useful form of acoustic communication that helps to maintain individual-specific bonds within social changing groupings. Key words: Vocal learning, social bonds, fluid societies. IZVLEŒEK Zvoœno posnemanje pri afriøkih slonih (<b>Loxodonta</b> <b>africana...</b>|$|R

50|$|Carthaginian forces also {{employed}} war-elephants, {{both within}} Africa and during overseas operations, including campaigns in Iberia and most famously Hannibal's invasion of Italy. These beasts were the now-extinct North African elephant (<b>Loxodonta</b> <b>africana</b> pharaoensis), probably a subspecies of the African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), which {{is smaller than}} the African bush elephant (<b>Loxodonta</b> <b>africana)</b> and the Indian elephants (elephas maximus) used by the Seleucids. In battle, the elephants functioned as a psychological weapon, frightening the opposing men and horses into flight or creating gaps in the enemy line that could be exploited by Carthaginian cavalry and infantry. Modern scholars have disputed whether or not Carthaginian elephants were furnished with turrets in combat; despite frequent assertions to the contrary, the evidence indicates that African forest elephants could and did carry turrets in certain military contexts.|$|R
