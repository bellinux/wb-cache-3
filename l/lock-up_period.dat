40|$|The {{research}} and development of new or improved energy technologies is a time consuming process. In addition, long capital <b>lock-up</b> <b>periods</b> in the energy sector mean that new, innovative technologies only enter the market very slowly. As a consequence of this, market requirements can only be met after a lenghty delay. In order to reduce the uncertainties associated with these time lags, the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) commissioned the study "Energy Technologies 2050 - Priorities for Research and Development" in summer 2008. The study aims to identify new accents in already existing R&D topics and new R&D topics from the perspective of public funding. The study should make a substantial contribution to directing research policy and setting priorities for non-nuclear energy research in the coming years.

After controlling for CEO family, board size, equity owned by minority shareholders, and other firm-specific characteristics, we find that family firms are less likely to adopt SOPs for rent extraction purpose. We also find that SOPs specifically granted to family members are less likely to pursue rent extraction goals. Our findings are robust against different specifications of family firms.

40|$|The main {{aims and}} {{objectives}} of my thesis are to test the various conflicting hypotheses developed in the previous literature to explain firms’ dividend policy, focusing specifically on IPOs and cross-country analysis. In particular, I explore the theoretical links {{in the context of the}} important dividend theories including signalling, agency costs, lifecycle and catering and then empirically test the hypotheses by using a very large dataset of UK IPOs from 1990 to 2010, which is extracted from offering prospectuses. The first empirical study focuses on two aspects of post-IPO decision-making: the decision to initiate dividends and the timing of dividend initiation. I develop the testable hypotheses by linking the dividend decisions of IPOs with a number of firm characteristics and IPO-specific factors in the context of the theories relating to dividends and IPO. I find a strong negative relation between underpricing and the propensity of dividend initiation. This finding is in line with the implications of Dividend Discount Model and Rock’s (1986) “winner’s curse”. My results show that the likelihood of initiating dividends is positively associated with managerial ownership, underwriter reputation, firm size, profitability and long-term debt ratio. In addition, the results show that the initiation propensity is negatively influenced by a serial of factors including the length of lockup period, VC backing, managerial stock option, growth opportunities of IPOs, technology intensity, and selection of growth stock exchange (i. e. AIM). Finally, I find that the IPOs issued in the years when the market put a price premium on dividend paying payers are more likely to pay dividend after IPO and initiate dividends earlier. Overall, my results show that IPO characteristics relate to dividend decisions of IPOs through miscellaneous mechanisms of dividends. The most homogeneous results are associated with the life cycle and catering theories. There is also some empirical evidence in support of signaling and agency theory. The second empirical study examines the determinants on the dividend policies stated in IPO prospectuses. At the stage of preparing for IPO, pre-IPO financial status is very likely to influence the initial dividend policies. My results provide strong evidence that IPOs that experienced superior performance in profitability and cash inflow from operating activities during pre-IPO period tend to make active dividend policies relatively, consistent with the implication of Lintner (1956) and Benartzi, Michaely and Thaler (1997). My results also show that IPOs with higher turnover ratio and lower capital expenditures tend to choose more active dividend policies when going public, consistent with residual theory and free cash flow hypothesis. In addition, the possibility of choosing relatively active dividend strategies at IPO stage is negatively associated with VC backing, length of full <b>lock-up</b> restriction <b>period,</b> stock option, technology focus, and institutional ownership. In contrast, IPOs with more reputable underwriters tend to declare relatively active dividend policy in prospectuses. The evidence relating to long-term debt ratio and managerial ownership is weak. Moreover, IPOs issued in the ‘internet bubble’ period or in 2000 s opt for relatively conservative dividend strategies. The overall results in this empirical chapter support lifecycle theory, substitution assumption-based agency theory and free cash flow hypothesis, while the evidence on signaling and catering theories is mixed. Furthermore, my results support the conjecture that IPOs with active dividend policies release sufficient information through dividend policies declared in offering prospectuses and therefore their formal dividend initiations fail to shock the market. I find that dividend- paying companies outperform non-dividend paying counterparts during three post-IPO years, indicating that non-dividend initiating IPOs rather than dividend-initiating ones account for the decline in long-run underperformance. Additionally, I find evidence in support of the conjecture that the dividend policies stated in prospectuses communicate the information, and thus reduce the possibilities that outside investors are overoptimistic over the prospect of the invested companies and that managers overstate the pre-IPO financial data at IPO stage. The third empirical study examines the trends in dividend policies across seven western countries: U. S., Candada, U. K., Germany, France, Japan and Hong Kong. In general, the proportion of dividend paying firms fell significantly from 1989 through to the early 2000 s, with the exception of Japanese firms. Thereafter, the percentage reverted slightly in the US, Canada, Japan and in Hong Kong, but continued to decrease in UK, France, and Germany. In contrast, the aggregate amount of dividends increased continuously across countries and firms retained stable dividend payout ratios, and total payout ratios relatively. Share repurchases took over from dividends as the dominant payout method in the US and the increasing importance of repurchases is observed in Canada and in the UK as well. A declining propensity to pay dividends is seen in all the sample countries apart from in Japan, controlling for key firm characteristics. I find that the likelihood that firms payout dividends or repurchase shares positively correlates with firm’s size, profitability and the ratio of earned/contributed capital, and negatively related to long-term debt ratio. The impact of growth opportunities on payout decisions is not uniform across countries, in line with Denis and Osobov (2008). There is some evidence that cash holdings have a negative relation with the probability of paying dividends and a positive relation with the probability of buying back shares. There is also some evidence that R&D expenditure and technology intensity have a negative influence on a firm’s tendency to pay dividends, but such influence is country-dependent. The effect of M&A on the incidence of payouts is highly country-dependant. For example, US acquirers are reluctant to pay dividends while UK acquirers are more likely to pay dividends. I also examine the determinants of the amounts of corporate payouts. Profitability, growth rate of total assets, and retained earnings are important positive factors in determining dividend amounts. Market to book ratio have a significantly positive effect on both dividend amounts and the repurchase amounts, consistent with Lee and Suh (2011), Alzahrani and Lasfer (2012). Finally, the empirical tests using Lintner model indicate that the link between cash dividends and earnings has weakened, in support of Choe (1990) and Brav, Graham, Harvey, and Michaely (2005). In line with Eije and Megginson (2008), the data demonstrates that dividends are still responsive to earnings. Overall, the evidence in this empirical chapter supports agency cost-based lifecycle theory. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|During the <b>lock-up</b> <b>period,</b> company {{insiders}} {{are prohibited}} from selling their shares for a set period immediately after initial public offerings (IPOs), usually 180 days. This strict prohibition limits the borrowing of securities by short sellers within this period. Therefore, upon reaching the lock-up expiry date, the short-sale constraint may be loosened and new investors may rush into the stock market, which affects asset price and stock return. This thesis focuses on the IPOs’ performance during the <b>lock-up</b> <b>period</b> {{and the reasons for}} the unusual performance. The first section commences by questioning the role of the short seller and its relation to the stock return during the <b>lock-up</b> <b>period.</b> Since Regulation SHO required that short sale transaction data be made available during year 2005 to 2007, we are able to use the daily short selling transaction data to examine the trading behaviour of short sellers during the period around the lock-up expiry date. We find that transactions around the lock-up expiration are associated with a significant drop in the abnormal return. Furthermore, on the lock-up expiry day, the short selling percentage reaches the highest point, while stock return drops to the lowest level compared to the <b>lock-up</b> <b>period.</b> Hence, there is a connection between short sale and stock return on the lock-up expiry day. We then examine whether trading behaviour of short sellers around the lock-up expiration contains any information of future stock returns. The results all indicate a highly significant predictability of short seller trading activities on future stock returns. The findings lead us to develop the second section. Since there is a dramatic drop of IPOs’ abnormal return during the lockup expiry day in the Regulation SHO period, in the second section, we investigate whether this is a universal phenomenon by using a comprehensive sample period from year 1990 to 2014. By implementing an event study with a wider event window, we discover that the abnormal returns indeed decrease significantly during most of the sample period. However, we reveal that the return decline trend ceases right after the lock-up expiration and even reverses to the highest level of return before the lock-up expiry day for several years. Therefore, we may assume that the lock-up expiration event does not have a permanent impact on stock returns...|$|E

We also find that German venture capitalists typically take companies with lower offering volumes on the market. They usually finance firms in a later stage, carry through fewer investment rounds and take their portfolio firms public earlier.

40|$|Understanding {{the factors}} leading each {{stakeholder}} {{to participate in}} an experimental trial is a key element for improving trial set-up and for identifying selection bias in statistical analyses. An experimental protocol, validated by the European Commission, was developed in France to assess the ability of the gamma-interferon test in terms of accuracy to replace the second intradermal skin test in cases of suspected bovine tuberculosis. Implemented between 2013 and 2015, this experimental trial was based on voluntary participation. To determine and understand the motivation or reluctance of farmers to take part in this trial, we carried out a sociological survey in France. Our study was based on semi-structured interviews with the farmers and other stakeholders involved. The analysis of findings demonstrated that shortening the <b>lock-up</b> <b>period</b> during tuberculosis suspicion, following the use of a gamma-interferon test, was an important aim and a genuine challenge for the animal health stakeholders. However, some farmers did not wish to continue the trial because it could potentially have drastic consequences for them.

Based on our results, we offer some recommendations: clear and appropriate communication tools should be prepared to explain the protocol and its aims. In addition, these types of animal health trials should be designed with the stakeholders' interests in mind. This study provides a better understanding of farmer motivations and stakeholder influences on trial participation and outcomes. The findings can be used to help design trials so that they promote participation by farmers and by all animal health stakeholders in general...|$|E
40|$|On December 16 th, 2011, Zynga, the {{well-known}} social game developing company went public. This event followed other recent IPOs {{in the world}} of social networking companies, such as Groupon or Linkedin among others. With a valuation close to 7 billion USD at the time when it went public, Zynga became one of the biggest web IPOs since Google. This recent enthusiasm for social networking companies raises the question whether they are overvalued. Indeed, during the few months since its IPO, Zynga showed significant variability, its market capitalization going from 5. 6 to 10. 2 billion USD, hinting at a possible irrational behavior from the market. To bring substance to the debate, we propose a two-tiered approach to compute the intrinsic value of Zynga. First, we introduce a new model to forecast its user base, based on the individual dynamics of its major games. Next, we model the revenues per user using a logistic function, a standard model for growth in competition. This allows us to bracket the valuation of Zynga using three different scenarios: 3. 4, 4. 0 and 4. 8 billion USD in the base case, high growth and extreme growth scenario respectively. This suggests that Zynga has been overpriced ever since its IPO. Finally, we propose an investment strategy (dated April 19 th, 2012 on the arXive), which is based on our diagnostic of a bubble for Zynga and how this herding / bubbly sentiment can be expected to play together with two important coming events (the quarterly financial result announcement around April 26 th, 2012 followed by the end of a first <b>lock-up</b> <b>period</b> around April 30 th, 2012). On the long term, our analysis indicates that Zynga's price should decrease significantly. The paper ends with a post-mortem analysis added on May 24 th, 2012, just before going to press, showing that we have successfully predicted the downward trend of Zynga. Since April 27 th, 2012, Zynga dropped 25 %...|$|E
40|$|Hype is a {{powerful}} force and it clearly influences people 2 ̆ 7 s behavior (Chen, Melessa, 2 ̆ 6 Zhang, 2012; Kothari, Li, 2 ̆ 6 Short, 2009; Lang 2 ̆ 6 Lundholm, 1996). Understanding {{and being able to}} identify hype is important, but more important is understanding how hype influences behavior. This dissertation examines the links between media hype and managerial expectations and firm outcomes. The paper begins with a conceptual framework that provides a model for understanding the information environment and how differential relationships between media hype and managerial behavior exist. Key aspects of the model are the sources and timing of hype, particularly a concept called a trigger event. Next, the dissertation suggests a new taxonomy for exploring media hype based on sources of hype to include Community Hype (online traffic), Own Hype (firm-generated press releases), Market Hype (major news periodicals), and Expert Hype (Wall Street analyst reports). Following the presentation of the new taxonomy of hype, a predictive model of the relationship between media hype and managerial behavior is presented and then empirically tested. The sample includes 126 US IPOs from 2007 - 2011 and longitudinal data is gathered over a two-year period surrounding the IPO event. Measures of over-confidence are develop theoretically and include 1) the allowance of negative earnings surprise events to occur and 2) failure of managers to prudently sell-off a portion of their equity at the expiration of the <b>lock-up</b> <b>period.</b> Hypotheses examine whether or not measures of over-confidence occur, how often they occur, and by how much they occur. Results indicate that managers are influenced by media hype in that they exhibit actions reflecting overconfidence when the media hype generated about the firm surrounding its IPO is volumous, salient with respect to the focal firm and relatively positive in nature. Curiously, results reveal that media 2 ̆ 7 s influence is not the same at all times and that it impacts managerial expectations and firm outcomes differently for different types of hype at different times...|$|E
40|$|The study aims to {{investigate}} the initial public offering’s (IPO) lock-up provision {{and its effects on}} price changes, trading volume and bid-ask spread around the lock-up expiry date. The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) is investigated in relation to the lock-up provision by using the event study methodology and comparison period returns approach (CPRA). The sample comprises 379 IPO companies, issued from January 2001 to December 2011. Both techniques support the semi-strong form of EMH for IPO market and all trading boards, as there is no detection of abnormal returns in price. In addition, total number of existing and new institutional and individual shareholders that bought shares and came in as substantial shareholders is more than the existing institutional and individual shareholders that sold their shares during lock-up expiration, and most of them have a significant cumulative average abnormal returns (CAARs). However, all these significant CAARs did not lead to a significant abnormal returns for all trading boards and IPO market. The results are the same as European findings, but contradict most US studies. On the other hand, the result of the event study methodology and CPRA shows a positive abnormal trading volume at lock-up expiry date for IPO market and buy and sale by institutional and individual shareholders, except for the ACE Market, which is negative. Insider trading activity sends noticeable signals for the investors as the lack of confidence of insiders about the futures' prospects, motivates sales of stocks after the expiration. In addition, high trading volume at and around the lock-up expiration is compatible with shareholders’ selling due to the diversification reasons and wealth recognition. As seen, these increases in trading volume cannot be a strong driver for price change at and around expiration. The event study methodology does not show {{a significant difference in the}} abnormal relative spread through the IPO market, different boards and sectors at the expiry date. On the other hand, the average abnormal spread for IPO market, MESDAQ and Main Market during the event window (- 7, + 7) is significantly different from unity for the event study methodology. However, the results of CPRA methodology for the abnormal spread contradict the event study methodology. CPRA’s result shows a mean daily spread for IPO market and different boards separately. The wider spread associated with the first lock-up expiry is likely to be imposed by market makers who are concerned with trading against the informed insiders. The analysis of buy and sell of substantial shareholders (individual and institutional) during the lock-up expiration shows an increase in average abnormal spread and mean daily spread (MDS) (CPRA methodology) for all categories. This significant increase in abnormal spread of mentioned categories shows information asymmetries between insiders and market makers (outsiders) that can be a strong driver for the significant change in abnormal spread of IPO market. On the other hand, market makers are forced to increase the spread to protect themselves from loss against liquidity or informed traders. The increase in trading costs in the shape of wider bid-ask spread reduces the interest of the stocks. However, bid-ask spread is used as the reward to the market maker for bearing the risk, and as an indicator of the amount of activity in the market. In this case, policy makers must propose strategies to monitor insiders’ activities during the <b>lock-up</b> <b>period...</b>|$|E
