5|$|Various {{features}} in the print are meant to intensify the feelings of dread: the murder {{takes place in a}} graveyard, said to be St Pancras but suggested by John Ireland to resemble Marylebone; an owl and a bat fly around the scene; the moon shines down on the crime; the clock strikes one {{for the end of the}} witching hour.

5|$|The {{mechanism}} may be internal to the Earth system. The Earth's {{climate system}} {{may have a}} natural resonance frequency of 100ka; that is to say, feedback processes within the climate automatically produce a 100ka effect, much as a bell naturally rings at a certain pitch. Opponents to this claim {{point out that the}} resonance would have to have developed 1 million years ago, as a 100ka periodicity was weak to non-existent for the preceding 2million years. This is feasible—continental drift and sea floor spreading rate change have been postulated as possible causes of such a change. Free oscillations of components of the Earth system have been considered as a cause, but too few Earth systems have a thermal inertia on a thousand-year timescale for any long-term changes to accumulate. The most common hypothesis <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, which might expand through a few shorter cycles until large enough to undergo a sudden collapse. The 100,000-year problem has been scrutinized by José A. Rial, Jeseung Oh and Elizabeth Reischmann who find that master-slave synchronization between the climate systems natural frequencies and the eccentricity forcing started the 100 ky ice ages of the late Pleistocene and explain their large amplitude.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Jason Wade in the driver's {{seat of a}} car, with {{the other members of}} Lifehouse in the car with him. The traffic is at a stand still in a tunnel, as a swarm of people have {{abandoned}} their vehicles and are walking through. Wade and the band members get out of the car, and begin walking in the opposite direction of the crowd {{to the other side of}} the tunnel. Wade pushes through the people, who are in a rush to get to the entrance of the tunnel and is constantly focused on his destination to get to the end. When he reaches the tunnel's end, he sees the wreckage of a car crash with firefighters and paramedics cleaning up the mess. Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead inside one of the crashed car. He then <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade looks into the other car, he sees himself, also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then he sees himself in the car with the band members, however everyone seems to be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes to the window, motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle of the tunnel for no apparent reason.|$|E

25|$|Because {{this method}} of {{creating}} an easement requires imposing a burden (the easement) upon another party {{for the benefit of}} the landlocked owner, the court <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original circumstances in weighing the relative apportionment of benefit and burden to both lots in making its equitable determination whether such easement shall be created by the court. This method of creating an easement, being an active creation by a court of an otherwise non-existent right, may be automatically extinguished upon termination of the necessity (for example, if a new public road is built adjacent to the landlocked tenement or another easement is acquired without regard to comparison of ease or practicality between the imposed easement and any valid substitute).|$|E

It claims as its own the faith of the historic Church expressed in the ancient creeds and reclaimed in the basic insights of the Protestant Reformers. It affirms the responsibility of the Church in each generation to make this faith its own in reality of worship, in honesty of thought and expression, and in purity of heart before God. In accordance with the teaching of our Lord and the practice prevailing among evangelical Christians, it recognizes two sacraments: Baptism and the Lord's Supper or Holy Communion.|$|E
500|$|A leading theory among audiences {{was that}} Chloe would {{eventually}} change {{her name to}} Lois Lane, Clark's wife in the comics, as she embodies various characteristics that Lois Lane has in the comic books. The creative team removed the notion that Chloe {{was going to turn}} into Clark's future wife when they introduced Lois Lane in season four. Though the characters share similarities, according to Mack, Chloe and Lois are more [...] "different shades of the same color [...] Chloe is a softer version of Lois". Chloe's upbringing allows her to be less jaded than Lois. Chloe also <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> future, whereas Lois is more shortsighted.|$|E

500|$|Additional {{positive}} feedback {{for the film}} came from Joblo.com reviewer Berge Garabedian, who praised director Bertino for [...] "building the tension nicely, with lots of silences, creepy voices, jump scares, use of songs and a sharp eye behind the camera, as well as plenty of Steadicam give it all more of a voyeuristic feel." [...] Empire Magazine remarked on the film's retro-style, saying, [...] "Like much recent horror, from the homages of the Grindhouse gang through flat multiplex remakes of drive-in classics, The Strangers <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> '70s.", and ultimately branded the film as [...] "an effective, scary emotional work-out." [...] Slant Magazines Nick Schager listed The Strangers as the 9th best film of 2008. Also, the film was ranked #13 on [...] "Bravo's 13 Scarier Movie Moments" [...] television piece.|$|E
500|$|In a major address, Grant stated: [...] "The {{building}} of rail-roads and the access thereby given {{to all the}} agricultural and mineral {{regions of the country}} is rapidly bringing civilized settlements into contact with all the tribes of indians. No matter what ought to be the relations between such settlements and the aborigines, the fact is they do not get on together, and one or the other has to give way in the end. A system which <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extinction of a race is too abhorant for a Nation to indulge in without without entailing upon the wrath of all Christendom, and without engendering in the Citizen a disregard for human life, and the rights of others, dangerous to society. I see no remedy for this except in placing all the indians on large reservations...and giving them absolute protection there." ...|$|E
500|$|Kierkegaard’s {{discourse}} {{has to do}} {{with the}} difference between wishing and willing in the development of a particular expectancy. [...] "As thought becomes more absorbed in the future, it loses its way in its restless attempt to force or entice an explanation from the riddle." [...] Expectancy always <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> future and can hope, but regret, which is what Goethe did in his book The Sorrows of Young Werther, closes the door of hope and love becomes unhappy. Kierkegaard points to [...] "faith as the highest" [...] expectancy because faith is something that everyone has, or can have. He says: [...] "The person who wishes it for another person wishes it for himself; the person who wishes it for himself wishes it for every other human being, because that by which another person has faith is not that by which he is different from him but is that by which he is like him; that by which he possesses it is not that by which he is different from others but that by which he is altogether like all." ...|$|E

Shep returns to her grave and he drops his flowers with the others. Shep <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left and sees a woman watering the flowers. Shep takes her watering can and runs back to Helen's grave. The woman picks up the watering can and waters the flowers {{and picks up the}} flower bouquet brought by Shep. An inter-title announces that night has come and it shows Shep lying asleep near the hedge. A ghostly image of Helen, superimposed on the film, appears through hedge and awakens Shep. Helen leads Shep through the cemetery and to her grave. Shep crawls to her grave and lies across the flowers as Helen's form disappears down into the grave. The camera lingers on Shep before fading. The final inter-title of the film announces [...] "Don't cry, it's only make believe" [...] showing Helen, holding flowers and leaning against Shep. This sequence and title may have served as a reminder to children in the audience it was all simply a dramatic story.|$|E
500|$|The T-1000 and the T-800 {{engage in}} {{physical}} combat, {{with the more}} advanced model succeeding in incapacitating and shutting off the T-800. However, unbeknownst to the T-1000, the T-800 is able to bring itself back online using emergency power. The T-1000 nearly kills John and Sarah but the T-800 takes it by surprise and shoots it into a vat of molten steel with an M79 grenade launcher, destroying it. John tosses the arm and CPU of the original Terminator into the vat as well. As Sarah expresses relief that the ordeal is over, the Terminator explains that {{to ensure that it}} is not used for reverse engineering it must also be destroyed. It asks Sarah to assist in lowering it into the vat of molten steel, since it is unable to [...] "self-terminate", although John begs the Terminator to reconsider its decision. It bids them farewell as it is lowered into the vat. The Terminator gives a tearful John a hug and final thumbs-up as it disappears into the molten steel and shuts down. Sarah <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> future with hope, musing that [...] "if a machine ... can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too." ...|$|E
500|$|Green Day's {{sound is}} often {{compared}} to first wave punk rock bands {{such as the}} Ramones, The Clash, Sex Pistols, The Jam, and the Buzzcocks. Stylistically, the group is characterized as punk rock, pop punk and alternative rock. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described Green Day as [...] "punk revivalists who recharged the energy of speedy, catchy three-chord punk-pop songs." [...] While Armstrong is the primary songwriter, he <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other band members for organizational help. Billie Joe Armstrong has mentioned {{that some of his}} biggest influences are seminal alternative rock bands Hüsker Dü and The Replacements, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs. Green Day has covered Hüsker Dü's [...] "Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely" [...] as a b-side to the [...] "Warning" [...] single, and the character [...] "Mr. Whirly" [...] in the group's song [...] "Misery" [...] is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name. Among other influences, Green Day have also cited The Kinks, The Who and power pop pioneers Cheap Trick. English rock musician Noel Gallagher of Oasis complained about the band semi-jokingly, claiming that the band had ripped off his song [...] "Wonderwall" [...] with its song [...] "Boulevard of Broken Dreams".|$|E
