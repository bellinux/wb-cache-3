25|$|Nogueira faced Frank Mir in {{a rematch}} on December 10, 2011, at UFC 140. After close early exchanges {{and a lot}} of work against the cage, the two separated, and Nogueira rocked Mir with a hard {{overhand}} right, jab combo. After Mir fell to the ground, Nogueira continued with ground and pound before attempting a guillotine choke. Mir was {{able to get out of}} this and during a scramble, ended in side control and locked up a kimura. Nogueira managed to roll Mir, only to be reversed himself. Mir stepped his right <b>leg</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> face of Nogueira and cranked the kimura, causing Nogueira's right humerus to break, thus ending the fight at 3:38 of round 1.|$|E
25|$|When {{band members}} are marching in one {{direction}} but want to focus their sound in another, they may rotate their bodies at the waist, so that only the upper portion of the body faces {{in the direction of}} play. This is known as lateral marching, but is more commonly known as either shifting, traversing, or sliding. A lateral march is not a change in the direction of march, only in the direction the upper body faces. Percussion players, whose large drum harnesses often prevent them from twisting their torsos, and sometimes tuba and sousaphone players, instead uses a crab step when moving sideways. During a crab step, the musician crosses one <b>leg</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> other, either marching on the toes or rolling the foot sideways. Percussionists may also substitute roll step when their instruments would interfere with performing the high step.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Hallo!' she cried, {{springing}} up, 'almost caught asleep!' And Owen, pocketing his pipe, spun his <b>legs</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> windowsill, {{while both}} began, in rattling, playful vindication and recrimination-- ...|$|R
60|$|Seaman lit {{one of his}} {{inevitable}} {{cigars and}} threw one of his short, fat <b>legs</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> other. He gazed for a moment {{with an air of}} satisfaction at his small foot, neatly encased in court shoes.|$|R

60|$|Instead of {{applying}} the brake, however, young Welland, in the exuberance of his joy, threw his long <b>legs</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> handles, {{and went down}} the slope at railway speed, ready, as he remarked, for a jump if anything should go wrong.|$|R
40|$|During the Deep Propagating Gravity Wave Experiment (DEEPWAVE) {{project in}} June and July 2014, the Gulfstream V {{research}} aircraft flew 97 <b>legs</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Southern Alps of New Zealand and 150 <b>legs</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Tasman Sea and Southern Ocean, {{mostly in the}} low stratosphere at 12. 1 -km altitude. Improved instrument calibration, redundant sensors, longer flight legs, energy flux estimation, and scale analysis revealed several new gravity wave properties. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> sea, flight-level wave fluxes mostly fell below <b>the</b> detection threshold. <b>Over</b> terrain, disturbances had characteristic mountain wave attributes of positive vertical energy flux (EFz), negative zonal momentum flux, and upwind horizontal energy flux. In some cases, the fluxes changed rapidly within an 8 -h flight, even though environmental conditions were nearly unchanged...|$|R
50|$|Male {{courtship}} involves scratching {{and beating}} the ground. After contacting female silk, males {{have been observed}} to stretch the web. Males manipulate their pedipalps and spasmodically beat their <b>legs</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> female. Females remain active during copulation by making body jerks and struggling.|$|R

25|$|Throughout {{the year}} white-tailed deer will rub-urinate, a process during which a deer squats while urinating so that urine will {{run down the}} insides of <b>the</b> deer's <b>legs,</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> tarsal glands, and onto the hair {{covering}} these glands. Bucks rub-urinate more frequently during the breeding season.|$|R
5000|$|Peruvian necktie [...] - [...] {{the arms}} of the person {{applying}} the choke are laced around the neck with the opponent's bottom arm straight through the hold, the person applying then turns the opponent around, and drapes his <b>legs</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> back, applying the pressure to the choke.|$|R
60|$|Twitter was by {{no means}} as bold as his friend, but, being ashamed to show the white feather, he quietly threw his shorter <b>legs</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> handles, and thus the two, perched--from a fore-and-aft point of view-- upon nothing, went in triumph {{to the bottom of the}} hill.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{be back in}} a minute," [...] he said, as he put his <b>leg</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{rail and}} lightly and swiftly lowered himself down into the darkness.|$|E
60|$|They shook hands. John wearily {{swung his}} <b>leg</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> pommel, {{but did not}} at once dismount. His clear gray eyes were wonderingly riveted upon the hunter.|$|E

60|$|To all our entreaties and suggestions, however, {{our leader}} only replied by {{a shake of}} the head, and {{continued}} to swing his long <b>legs</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> side of the waggon with his eyes fixed intently upon the horsemen, {{many of whom had}} dismounted and were leaning their carbines <b>over</b> <b>the</b> cruppers of their chargers.|$|R
50|$|To {{perform a}} cartwheel, one moves {{sideways}} {{in a straight}} line, keeping the back straight; places {{the hand of the}} same side on the ground, followed by the other hand; kicks <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> body and brings them down as the hands and body come up to a standing position.|$|R
6000|$|... "Reminds me of a {{boarding}} party of pirates," [...] remarked Billy Mallory, {{as he watched}} Blanco, the last to throw a <b>leg</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> rail, reach the deck.|$|E

60|$|He flung his <b>legs</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{bench and}} took up his brushes.

50|$|In {{motorcycle}} skitching, {{the driver}} of the motorcycle flips their <b>legs</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> saddle and drags their feet on the ground while holding onto the handlebars. This is similar to ghost-riding in motor vehicles. Motorcycle skitching requires metal plates on the soles of the rider's shoes to protect them from the road surface.|$|R
60|$|We {{introduce}} {{this subject}} merely because thoughts somewhat {{similar to those}} which we have so inadequately expressed were burning in the brain of a handsome and joyful young man one summer morning not long ago, as, with <b>legs</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> handles, he flashed--if he did not actually fly--down one of our Middlesex hills {{on his way to}} London.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not yet, my angel," [...] {{said the}} skeleton, placidly, {{as he crossed}} one thin <b>leg</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> other and looked calmly at her. [...] "Come here an' see Job's new boy." ...|$|E

50|$|Sakis are diurnal animals. They live in {{the trees}} of the rain forests and only {{occasionally}} go onto the land. They mostly move on all fours, sometimes running in an upright position on <b>the</b> hind <b>legs</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> branches, and sometimes jumping long distances. For sleeping they roll themselves cat-like in the branches. They are generally very shy, cautious animals.|$|R
6000|$|He was right. They {{had more}} than their usual effect on him. The instant he heard them, Phil Briant shouted--"Ay, ay, sir!"

50|$|This {{variation}} of the cloverleaf sees the wrestler, after crossing one of <b>the</b> opponents <b>legs</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> other in a figure four shape, lock <b>the</b> <b>over</b> <b>leg</b> behind their near knee before placing the straight leg under their armpit and turning <b>over.</b> <b>The</b> wrestler proceeds to lean back pulling on the leg under the armpit. This keeps <b>the</b> <b>over</b> <b>leg,</b> now under, locked while putting pressure on the leg and stretching the legs and back. This variation is also used by Tyler Breeze as the Figure Four Sharpshooter.|$|R
