5|$|Inocybe maculata, {{commonly}} known as the frosty fibrecap, is a species of mushroom in the Inocybaceae family. First described by Jean Louis Émile Boudier in 1885, I. maculata can be found throughout Europe, Asia and North America. It is a medium-sized brown mushroom with a fibrous, brown cap with white remnants of a universal veil in the middle. The stem is cream or brown. The species is ectomycorrhizal and grows at the base of various trees, including beech. Inocybe maculata is poisonous, containing muscarine. Possible symptoms after consumption of I.maculata mushrooms are salivation, <b>lacrimation,</b> urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and vomiting, with the possibility of death due to respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that, in 12 workers exposed for two or more years to acetic acid airborne average concentration of 51 ppm (estimated), produced symptoms of conjunctive irritation, upper respiratory tract irritation, and hyperkeratotic dermatitis. Exposure to 50 ppm or more is intolerable to most persons and results in intensive <b>lacrimation</b> and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, with pharyngeal oedema and chronic bronchitis. Unacclimatised humans experience extreme eye and nasal irritation at concentrations in excess of 25 ppm, and conjunctivitis from concentrations below 10 ppm {{has been reported}}. In a study of five workers exposed for seven to 12 years to concentrations of 80 to 200 ppm at peaks, the principal findings were blackening and hyperkeratosis of {{the skin of the}} hands, conjunctivitis (but no corneal damage), bronchitis and pharyngitis, and erosion of the exposed teeth (incisors and canines).|$|E

25|$|The {{facial nerve}} {{controls}} {{a number of}} functions, such as blinking and closing the eyes, smiling, frowning, <b>lacrimation,</b> salivation, flaring nostrils and raising eyebrows. It also carries taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, via the chorda tympani nerve (a branch of the facial nerve). Because of this, people with Bell's palsy may present with loss of taste sensation in the anterior 2/3 of the tongue on the affected side.|$|E
25|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of Graves' disease virtually all result from the direct and indirect effects of hyperthyroidism, with main exceptions being Graves' ophthalmopathy, goiter, and pretibial myxedema (which are caused by the autoimmune processes of the disease). Symptoms of the resultant hyperthyroidism are mainly insomnia, hand tremor, hyperactivity, hair loss, excessive sweating, shaking hands, itching, heat intolerance, weight loss despite increased appetite, diarrhea, frequent defecation, palpitations, muscle weakness, and skin warmth and moistness. Further signs that may be seen on physical examination are most commonly a diffusely enlarged (usually symmetric), nontender thyroid, lid lag, excessive <b>lacrimation</b> due to Graves' ophthalmopathy, arrhythmias of the heart, such as sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and premature ventricular contractions, and hypertension. People with hyperthyroidism may experience behavioral and personality changes, including: psychosis, mania, anxiety, agitation, and depression.|$|E
500|$|Inocybe godeyi flesh has {{a strong}} smell, which has been {{variously}} described as [...] "unpleasant", [...] "earthy or mealy", and [...] "not distinctive". The flesh has an acrid taste. The mushrooms {{are known to be}} poisonous, containing toxic compounds of muscarine. Consumption of the mushroom could lead to a number of physiological effects, including: salivation, <b>lacrimation,</b> urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and emesis (vomiting); this array of symptoms is also known by the acronym SLUDGE. Other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure, sweating and death due to respiratory failure.|$|E
500|$|Inocybe cookei {{has been}} {{described}} as both poisonous (due to the presence of muscarine compounds) and non-toxic. Consumption of mushrooms containing muscarine compounds could lead to a number of physiological effects, including: excess salivation, <b>lacrimation,</b> uncontrolled urination or defecation, gastrointestinal problems and emesis (vomiting); this array of symptoms may also be known by the acronym SLUDGE. Other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure, sweating and death due to respiratory failure. The flesh of the mushroom has a mild taste and a slight smell of honey. Regardless of its actual toxicity or edibility, it is considered [...] "best avoided".|$|E
500|$|The {{species has}} a mild, indistinct taste, and a faint smell of flour. Mycologist Roger Phillips {{describes}} its edibility as [...] "suspect", recommending {{that it be}} avoided, and notes {{that it is possible}} that the species is poisonous; most species of Inocybe have been shown to contain poisonous chemicals. Mycologist Ian Robert Hall lists the mushroom as containing the poisonous compound muscarine. Consumption of muscarine could lead to a number of physiological effects, including: excess salivation, <b>lacrimation,</b> uncontrollable urination and defecation, gastrointestinal problems and emesis (vomiting); this array of symptoms is also known by the acronym SLUDGE. Other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure, sweating and death due to respiratory failure.|$|E

2500|$|Symptoms {{consist of}} redness (mainly due to {{vasodilation}} of the peripheral small blood vessels), {{swelling of the}} conjunctiva, itching, and increased <b>lacrimation</b> (production of tears). If this is combined with rhinitis, the condition is termed [...] "allergic rhinoconjunctivitis". The symptoms are due to release of histamine and other active substances by mast cells, which stimulate dilation of blood vessels, irritate nerve endings, and increase secretion of tears.|$|E
2500|$|Inocybe lacera has mild-tasting {{flesh and}} a mild, mealy smell. The North American variety I.lacera var. heterosperma has a [...] smell. However, species of Inocybe {{should always be}} avoided when {{choosing}} mushrooms for consumption, {{as many of the}} members of the genus are dangerously toxic. I. lacera is known to be poisonous, containing quantities of the toxic compound muscarine. Consumption of the mushroom typically leads to salivation, <b>lacrimation,</b> urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and emesis (vomiting), which has given rise to the acronym SLUDGE. Other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure, sweating and death due respiratory failure.|$|E
2500|$|A fully paralyzed {{patient is}} unable to move, speak, blink the eyes, or {{otherwise}} respond to the pain. It is incorrect to think that physiological signs such as increased heart rate (tachycardia), blood pressure (hypertension), dilation of the pupils (mydriasis), sweating (diaphoresis), {{and the formation of}} tears (<b>lacrimation)</b> will continue to occur normally in response to pain in the anesthetized state [...] [...] If neuromuscular blocking drugs are used this causes skeletal muscle paralysis and interferes with the functioning of the autonomic nervous system. [...] The patient cannot signal their distress and they may not exhibit the signs of awareness that would be expected to be detectable by clinical vigilance.|$|E
2500|$|Inocybe lacera (commonly {{known as}} the torn fibrecap) is a {{poisonous}} species of mushroom in the genus Inocybe. Its appearance {{is that of a}} typical [...] "little brown mushroom": small, brown and indistinct. However, it is distinguishable by its microscopic features, particularly its long, smooth spores. As with many other species of Inocybe, I.lacera contains the poisonous chemical muscarine which, if consumed, can lead to salivation, <b>lacrimation,</b> urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and emesis. Found in Europe and North America, it typically grows in autumn in mixed woods, favouring sandy soil. There are several documented subspecies in addition to the main I.lacera var lacera, including the dwarf form I.lacera var. subsquarrosa and I.lacera var. heterosperma, found in North America.|$|E
2500|$|... {{is used in}} the {{electrical}} industry as a gaseous dielectric medium for high-voltage circuit breakers, switchgear, and other electrical equipment, often replacing oil filled circuit breakers (OCBs) that can contain harmful PCBs. [...] gas under pressure is used as an insulator in gas insulated switchgear (GIS) because it has a much higher dielectric strength than air or dry nitrogen. The high dielectric strength {{is a result of the}} gas's high electronegativity and density. This property makes it possible to significantly reduce the size of electrical gear. This makes GIS more suitable for certain purposes such as indoor placement, as opposed to air-insulated electrical gear, which takes up considerably more room. Gas-insulated electrical gear is also more resistant to the effects of pollution and climate, as well as being more reliable in long-term operation because of its controlled operating environment. Exposure to an arc chemically breaks down [...] though most of the decomposition products tend to quickly re-form , a process termed [...] "self-healing". Arcing or corona can produce disulfur decafluoride (...) , a highly toxic gas, with toxicity similar to phosgene. [...] was considered a potential chemical warfare agent in World War II because it does not produce <b>lacrimation</b> or skin irritation, thus providing little warning of exposure.|$|E
