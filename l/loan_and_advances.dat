ABSTRACT: Lending {{represents one of the}} core functions of commercial banking system. The essential role of banks in the economy has been to intermediate funds between surplus and deficit economic units. In the process of carrying out this primary task, banks have found themselves performing a number of functions which include: the mobilization of savings, stimulation of investment and economic growth, assistance in resources allocation, boosting of international trade and promotion of the payment system. The few studies which have been conducted on bank lending in Nigeria focused on the pre-consolidation banking era. This study examines the effect of deposit volume on bank lending behaviour in the Nigerian post-consolidation banking period. The population of the study comprises the 22 deposit money banks operating in Nigeria as at December, 2012. Data were obtained from the audited annual reports of the 22 banks for the post-consolidation period of 2006 - 2012. The analysis was conducted using regression analysis with the aid of SPSS package. The results revealed a positive and significant relationship between deposit volume and <b>loan</b> <b>and</b> <b>advances</b> in the selected banks. The study recommends that future researchers should investigate other factors which may exert some influence on the lending behaviour deposit money banks in Nigeria beside deposit volume. Specifically, factors such as capitalization, interest rates, gross domestic product, and liquidity ratio were mentioned...|$|E

40|$|Research Question and Problem Statement: Developing a {{sustainable}} financial systems for poor {{is critical for}} any developing economy particularly Bangladesh for various reasons. Firstly, it will include a large population of bankable poor into formal financial sector who are currently excluded and hence will benefit both parties over a long run. Secondly, generating sustainable funds for skilled/semi-skilled poor {{to start a business}} will increase number of micro and small enterprises and employment. Thirdly, sustainable financial service with access to credit can help poverty reduction through improving the productivity of micro and small enterprises or creating new opportunities of livelihood. Though micro credit for helping poor in the context of Bangladesh is not a new idea, yet question remains on the sustainability of such institutions which are mostly backed by donor funds or government funds with high risk of insolvency along with high transaction cost (due to high cost of capital at 26. 5 per cent on <b>loan</b> <b>and</b> <b>advances)</b> (Hossain, 1998, p. 7). The micro finance institutions are not recognised as regulated financial institutions which impact the ability and cost of finance and transactions. The regulatory and operational restriction often result in rationing out sectors of the client population which the institutions and programmes want to serve and eventually questions the sustainability of micro-finance institutions and programmes working with the poor. In this bleak situation, a second generation social bank in Bangladesh focusing on a new model to bank with poor {{is considered to be a}} bold step towards building sustainable financial system for banking with the poor. The main research objective is to explore the views held by bank directors as well as managers towards their mission statement for ‘Empowering real poor families and create local income opportunities’ and ‘Providing support for social benefit organizations - by way of mobilizing funds and social services’ and thus analyse the findings from the unique socio-economic-political-regulatory context of developing economy like Bangladesh. This longitudinal case study will explore the participatory three sector banking model developed by the bank which includes: i) Formal sector : dealing with human face approach to credit and banking on the profit and loss sharing ii) Non—formal sector: informal finance and credit package that empowers and humanizes real poor family and create local income opportunities and discourage internal migration iii) Voluntary sector: responding spontaneously to its social commitment to help hard core poor with various welfare activities The purpose of the study is to focus on the model for sustainable banking with the poor in the context of developing economy which will contribute towards reduction of poverty...|$|E

Credit risk arises from non performance by a borrower. It may arise from either an inability or an unwillingness to perform in the pre-commitment contracted manner.

The more credit of a particular is in risk, the more probability of a bank to be insolvent. Therefore, the status of depositor in the bank is at risk and probability of incurring loss from their deposited value. In other way the risk of a commercial bank is calculated through long term and short term rating by the credit rating agencies. Southeast Bank Limited is a scheduled commercial bank in Bangladesh.
