40|$|Drawing from {{well-known}} {{theories of}} democracy and democratic transition, this essay considers the transition to <b>local</b> <b>democracy</b> in Latin America. It raises a central question: Given the landmark decentralization {{of the past three}} decades, what constitutes <b>local</b> <b>democracy</b> in the region today and in which countries can we say it exists? Core considerations in comparing <b>local</b> <b>democracy</b> and national democracy are discussed. I present the concept of â€œminimum decentralizationâ€ and, using this framework, posit six procedural and institutional conditions for defining <b>local</b> <b>democracy.</b> Eighteen systems are evaluated against these conditions at the municipal and intermediate levels of government. Despite the real transfer of authority in many countries, and though several Latin American countries have established or nearly established <b>local</b> <b>democracies,</b> {{only a few of the}} local systems can be considered democratic. Though the conclusion is somewhat counter-intuitive, explanations for the slow development of decentralization and <b>local</b> <b>democracy</b> are considered.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an {{up to date}} analysis of the French local government system and its potential for realisation of <b>local</b> <b>democracy.</b> It is structured into three sections in which the pros and cons, the improvements and shilly-shal-lying delineate <b>local</b> <b>democracy</b> in France. First, through the restricted French vision that participative democracy only supplements, not enriches representative democracy. Second, the structural and organisational crisis of repre-sentative <b>local</b> <b>democracy</b> will be examined against the context of continuing process of decentralisation. Finally, the paper concludes that the way <b>local</b> <b>democracy</b> is being defined and operated in France today raises more ques-tions than it provides answers. Whichever {{the point of view}} is taken, several questions need answers. To which degree are representatives answerable? Can participative democ-racy end up in no democracy...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{attention}} has increasingly been focussing {{on the quality}} of <b>local</b> <b>democracy.</b> Through the transfer of central government tasks to the municipalities, the importance of local government for citizens in the Netherlands has increased. This also places higher demands on the way <b>local</b> <b>democracy</b> functions. For various reasons, {{it is not easy to}} meet these demands. The debate {{on the quality of}} <b>local</b> <b>democracy</b> can be reduced to two basic questions: what is local and what is democracy? Instead of answering these questions, the authors of the article (editors of this new series) demonstrate what knowledge is needed to do this. They outline broadly the agenda for a local democratic audit, for which this article is an introduction. After a short theoretical discussion of the importance of <b>local</b> <b>democracy,</b> the authors point out those knowledge gaps that still exist in their opinion. They do so on the basis of current research. After identifying the key relations in <b>local</b> <b>democracy,</b> they present an agenda for further research...|$|R

40|$|Uganda {{embarked}} in 1993 on radical decentralization, {{among other}} reasons, to enhance local governance and <b>local</b> <b>democracy.</b> The {{major focus of}} the decentralization policy was on empowering citizens to participate in decisions that affect their localities. This issue will be examined based on two major themes of the twelve principles of the Commonwealth’s ‘Aberdeen Agenda’ for <b>local</b> <b>democracy</b> – the enabling environment and participation. However, the paper argues that Uganda’s devolutionary decentralization can only foster local governance and <b>local</b> <b>democracy</b> if it is properly conceptualised, the facilitating conditions are given careful attention, and the institutional framework is sufficiently elaborate and effective to enable it to achieve its intended objectives. Short of these measures, the gap between intent and reality might be so great as to disable the decentralization policy from achieving real local governance and <b>local</b> <b>democracy...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Within <b>local</b> <b>democracy</b> in Denmark, {{there seems}} to be a trend towards {{thinking}} <b>local</b> <b>democracy</b> differently than it traditionally has been done. This trend apparently leans towards some of the newer democracy theories. We have chosen to describe these theories as interaction theories. We find this development in <b>local</b> <b>democracy</b> very interesting, hence our problem definition as follows: “To what extent is interaction theory expressed in the <b>local</b> <b>democracy</b> in the Danish municipalities, and what challenges are the involved parties experiencing in the democratic arena as a consequence of this approach?” As a method, we have chosen must-Likely cases to answer this. The cases are based in City of Aarhus and Holbaek Municipality. Through an analysis of relevant documents and conducted interviews, we can generally conclude that, there is an interaction theoretical approach to <b>local</b> <b>democracy,</b> which is largely reflected in both Aarhus and Holbaek Municipality. However, this is with the reservation that the two municipalities have not embraced to the two interaction theories fully, neither in regards to the transfer of authority away from the political level, or when it comes to the centralization of tasks...|$|R

The {{ways in which they}} can do this are various, ranging from the provision of information to direct involvement in decision-making. This paper focuses on the impact of adopting different types of community engagement strategy on <b>local</b> <b>democracy.</b> Two principal types of community engagement strategy are identified: consumerist and participatory, and their potential for encouraging effective engagement is discussed, before their implications for <b>local</b> <b>democracy</b> are modelled. The paper argues that the relative priority accorded to different types of community engagement are likely to cause <b>local</b> <b>democracy</b> to evolve towards consumer, stakeholder, radical or citizen-centred democracy...|$|R

40|$|Recent reform {{trends in}} local {{government}} ‘constitution’ have aimed at invigorating <b>local</b> <b>democracy</b> by strengthening <b>local</b> executive powers and making political leadership more visible through direct mayor elections. However, observers still tend {{to paint a}} gloomy picture of <b>local</b> <b>democracy</b> in contexts where reforms have been implemented. This article evaluates the notion of marginalised <b>local</b> <b>democracy</b> by adopting mandate theory. A data set on Norwegian mayors and deputy mayors provides evidence that mayors elected by the council are more confident in their own success regarding fulfilment of pre-election announcements than deputy mayors are. The mayoral advantage disappears if the mayor is directly elected. Regarding implementation of idiomatic party policy, political cohesion between {{the mayor and the}} deputy mayor (coalition or party conjunction) increases the confidence of both. Yet, cohesion does not increase confidence in fulfilling pre-election announcements, thus suggesting a rupture between issues emphasised in campaigns to local election and idiomatic party policy. While results are unfavourable to direct mayor elections, they do not otherwise support the gloomy picture of marginalised <b>local</b> <b>democracy...</b>|$|R
