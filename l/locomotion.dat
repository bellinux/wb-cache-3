5|$|Locomotor {{behavior}} in lemurs, both living and extinct, is highly varied and its diversity exceeds that of anthropoids. Locomotor postures and behaviors have included vertical clinging and leaping (including saltatory behavior), seen in indriids and bamboo lemurs; slow (loris-like) arboreal quadrupedal <b>locomotion,</b> once exhibited by Mesopropithecus; fast arboreal quadrupedal <b>locomotion,</b> seen in true lemurs and ruffed lemurs; partially terrestrial quadrupedal <b>locomotion,</b> {{seen in the}} ring-tailed lemur; highly terrestrial quadrupedal <b>locomotion,</b> once exhibited by monkey lemurs such as Hadropithecus; and sloth-like suspensory <b>locomotion,</b> once exhibited {{by many of the}} sloth lemurs, such as Palaeopropithecus. The Lac Alaotra gentle lemur (Hapalemur alaotrensis) has even been reported to be a good swimmer. Sometimes these locomotor types are lumped together into two main groups of lemurs, the vertical clingers and leapers and the arboreal (and occasionally terrestrial) quadrupeds.|$|E
5|$|Amargasaurus was quadrupedal (moved on four legs), and {{probably}} {{was unable to}} rear on its hind legs. Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested that Amargasaurus was a slow walker, as both the forearms and lower legs were proportionally short, as a feature common to slow-moving animals. This was contradicted by Gerardo Mazzetta and Richard Fariña (1999), who argued that Amargasaurus was capable of rapid <b>locomotion.</b> During <b>locomotion,</b> leg bones are strongly affected by bending moments, representing a limiting factor for the maximum speed of an animal. The leg bones of Amargasaurus were even more sturdy than those of today's white rhinoceros, which is adapted to galloping.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from their}} {{function}} in <b>locomotion,</b> the tube feet act as accessory gills. The water vascular system serves to transport oxygen from, {{and carbon dioxide}} to, the tube feet and also nutrients from the gut to the muscles involved in <b>locomotion.</b> Fluid movement is bidirectional and initiated by cilia. Gas exchange also takes place through other gills known as papulae, which are thin-walled bulges on the aboral surface of the disc and arms. Oxygen is transferred from these to the coelomic fluid, which acts as the transport medium for gasses. Oxygen dissolved in the water is distributed through the body mainly by the fluid in the main body cavity; the circulatory system may also play a minor role.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the {{terrestrial}} <b>locomotion</b> of Pteranodon, especially {{whether it was}} bipedal or quadrupedal, {{has been the subject}} of debate. Today, most pterosaur researchers agree that pterosaurs were quadrupedal, thanks largely to the discovery of pterosaur trackways.|$|E
5|$|Katsufumi Sato, a Japanese scientist, did {{calculations}} using modern {{birds and}} concluded {{that it was impossible}} for a pterosaur to stay aloft. In the book Posture, <b>Locomotion,</b> and Paleoecology of Pterosaurs it is theorized {{that they were able to}} fly due to the oxygen-rich, dense atmosphere of the Late Cretaceous period. However, both Sato and the authors of Posture, <b>Locomotion,</b> and Paleoecology of Pterosaurs based their research on the now outdated theories of pterosaurs being seabird-like, and the size limit does not apply to terrestrial pterosaurs, such as azhdarchids and tapejarids. Furthermore, Darren Naish concluded that atmospheric differences between the present and the Mesozoic were not needed for the giant size of pterosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Lobatus gigas has {{an unusual}} means of <b>locomotion,</b> first {{described}} in 1922 by George Howard Parker (1864–1955). The animal first fixes the posterior {{end of the}} foot by thrusting {{the point of the}} sickle-shaped operculum into the substrate, then it extends the foot in a forward direction, lifting and throwing the shell forward in a so-called leaping motion. This way of moving is considered to resemble that of pole vaulting, making L.gigas a good climber even of vertical concrete surfaces. This leaping <b>locomotion</b> may help prevent predators from following the snail's chemical traces, which would otherwise leave a continuous trail on the substrate.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes {{have also}} {{inspired}} and played roles in scientific research. In 1963, a walking vehicle with 36 legs was designed, {{said to have}} been inspired by a study of millipede <b>locomotion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some organisms use rolling as a {{means of}} <b>locomotion.</b> These {{examples}} do not constitute the use of a wheel, as the organism rotates as a whole, rather than employing separate parts which rotate independently.|$|E
5|$|Suborder Monostilifera. Includes 500 {{species with}} a single central stylet. Some use the stylet for <b>locomotion</b> {{as well as for}} {{capturing}} prey.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} of aquatic <b>locomotion</b> via swimming {{has been discussed}} briefly in several papers (Bennett 2001, 1994, and Bramwell & Whitfield 1974).|$|E
5|$|The {{processes}} of evolution, {{as they are}} presently understood, can help explain why wheeled <b>locomotion</b> has not evolved in multicellular organisms: simply put, a complex structure or system will not evolve if its incomplete form provides no benefit to the organism.|$|E
5|$|The tuatara is {{considered}} the most unspecialised living amniote; the brain and mode of <b>locomotion</b> resemble those of amphibians and the heart is more primitive than {{that of any other}} reptile. The lungs have a single chamber and lack bronchi.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{researchers}} now consider Heterodontosaurus a bipedal runner, some earlier studies proposed a partial or fully quadrupedal <b>locomotion.</b> In 1980, Santa Luca described several {{features of the}} forelimb that are also present in recent quadrupedal animals and imply a strong arm musculature: these include a large olecranon (a bony eminence forming the uppermost part of the ulna), enlarging the lever arm of the forearm. The medial epicondyle of the humerus was enlarged, providing attachment sites for strong flexor muscles of the forearm. Furthermore, projections on the claws might have increased the forward thrust of the hand during walking. According to Santa Luca, Heterodontosaurus was quadrupedal when moving slowly but was able {{to switch to a}} much faster, bipedal run. Polish palaeontologists Teresa Maryańska and Halszka Osmólska supported Santa Luca's hypothesis in 1985; furthermore, they noted that the dorsal spine was strongly flexed downwards in the most completely known specimen. In 1987, Gregory S. Paul suggested that Heterodontosaurus might have been obligatorily quadrupedal, and that these animals would have galloped for fast <b>locomotion.</b> David Weishampel and Lawrence Witmer in 1990 as well as Norman and colleagues in 2004 argued in favour of exclusively bipedal <b>locomotion,</b> based on the morphology of the claws and shoulder girdle. The anatomical evidence suggested by Santa Luca was identified as adaptations for foraging; the robust and strong arms might have been used for digging up roots and breaking open insect nests.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 12,000 {{millipede}} {{species have}} been described. Estimates of the true number of species on earth range from 15,000 to as high as 80,000. Few species of millipede are at all widespread; they have very poor dispersal abilities, depending as they do on terrestrial <b>locomotion</b> and humid habitats. These factors have favoured genetic isolation and rapid speciation, producing many lineages with restricted ranges.|$|E
5|$|As they {{evolved from}} lunged fish, {{amphibians}} {{had to make}} certain adaptations for living on land, including {{the need to develop}} new means of <b>locomotion.</b> In the water, the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward, but on land, quite different mechanisms were required. Their vertebral columns, limbs, limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for <b>locomotion</b> and feeding. Terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air. They needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature. They developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment. Their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water. The skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss.|$|E
5|$|Cicadas, {{unlike other}} Auchenorrhyncha, are not adapted for jumping (saltation). They have the usual insect modes of <b>locomotion,</b> walking and flight. However, {{they do not}} walk or run well, and take to the wing to travel {{distances}} greater than a few centimetres. Cicadas can extend their hindlegs in under a millisecond to execute a jump, implying elastic storage of energy for sudden release.|$|E
5|$|In 1823 Stephenson and Pease opened Robert Stephenson and Company, a {{locomotive}} works at Forth Street, Newcastle, {{from which the}} following year the S ordered two steam locomotives and two stationary engines. On 16 September 1825, with the stationary engines in place, the first locomotive, <b>Locomotion</b> No. 1, left the works, and the following day it was advertised that the railway would open on 27 September 1825.|$|E
5|$|Insect {{walking is}} of {{particular}} interest as an alternative form of <b>locomotion</b> in robots. The study of insects and bipeds has a significant impact on possible robotic methods of transport. This may allow new robots to be designed that can traverse terrain that robots with wheels may be unable to handle.|$|E
5|$|Lemur {{behavior}} is as variable as lemur morphology. Differences in diet, social systems, activity patterns, <b>locomotion,</b> communication, predator avoidance tactics, breeding systems, and intelligence levels help define lemur taxa and set individual species {{apart from the}} rest. Although trends frequently distinguish the smaller, nocturnal lemurs from the larger, diurnal lemurs, there are often exceptions that help exemplify the unique and diverse nature of these Malagasy primates.|$|E
5|$|Limbs used by {{animals for}} <b>locomotion</b> over terrain are {{frequently}} {{also used for}} other purposes, such as grasping, manipulating, climbing, branch-swinging, swimming, digging, jumping, throwing, kicking, and grooming. With a lack of articulation, wheels {{would not be as}} useful as limbs in these roles.|$|E
5|$|Normally a {{sluggish}} species, {{it relies on}} camouflage for protection. <b>Locomotion</b> is primarily rectilinear, using the broad ventral scales in a caterpillar fashion and aided by its own weight for traction. When agitated, it can resort to a typical serpentine movement and move with surprising speed.|$|E
5|$|Over 1000 specimens, {{representing}} organisms of {{all stages}} of maturity, have now {{been found in the}} White Sea area at the bottom of fine-grained sandstone layers. The large number of specimens, the small grain-size of the sediments and the variety of circumstances in which specimens were preserved provide detailed information about Kimberella′s external form, internal anatomy, <b>locomotion</b> and feeding style.|$|E
5|$|The club's main rivals are Hartlepool United. The club's {{traditional}} colours {{are black}} and white shirts, black shorts and black and white socks. The club's crest depicts <b>Locomotion</b> No 1, referring to the town's railway history; {{as well as a}} stylised Quaker hat, referring to the religious movement that had a historic influence on the town, and which was the source of the team's nickname, the Quakers.|$|E
5|$|The usual form of <b>locomotion</b> is hopping, {{with both}} feet leaving the ground and landing simultaneously. However, birds may run when {{performing}} the rodent-run display. Its balance is assisted by a proportionally large tail, which is usually held upright and rarely still. The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts.|$|E
5|$|While {{the pelvis}} {{is not entirely}} {{like that of a}} human (being {{markedly}} wide, or flared, with laterally orientated iliac blades), these features point to a structure radically remodelled to accommodate a significant degree of bipedalism. The femur angles in toward the knee from the hip. This trait allows the foot to fall closer to the midline of the body, and strongly indicates habitual bipedal <b>locomotion.</b> Present-day humans, orangutans and spider monkeys possess this same feature. The feet feature adducted big toes, making it difficult if not impossible to grasp branches with the hindlimbs. Besides <b>locomotion,</b> A. afarensis also had a slightly larger brain than a modern chimpanzee (the closest living relative of humans) and had teeth that were more human than ape-like.|$|E
5|$|Work by {{engineer}} Mieczysław G. Bekker {{implies that}} the distribution of irregularities in natural terrains is log-normal; that is, small obstacles are far more common than larger ones. Thus, obstacle navigation presents a challenge to wheeled <b>locomotion</b> in natural terrains at all size scales. The primary means of obstacle navigation are to go around obstacles and to go over them; each has its attendant challenges.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster {{is prone}} to genetic {{abnormalities}} in the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids. They can develop tumours of the mammary glands, lungs, uterus, and ovaries. Tumours can also develop if the animal is exposed to chemical carcinogens. Due to having slow <b>locomotion</b> and an insignificant response to bright lights and humans, as well as having a low population density, field studies allow scientists to study entire populations in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the fastest insect runners and, at full speed, adopt a bipedal run to reach a high {{velocity}} in proportion to their body size. As cockroaches move very quickly, {{they need to be}} video recorded at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait. More sedate <b>locomotion</b> is seen in the stick insects or walking sticks (Phasmatodea). A few insects have evolved to walk {{on the surface of the}} water, especially members of the Gerridae family, commonly known as water striders. A few species of ocean-skaters in the genus Halobates even live on the surface of open oceans, a habitat that has few insect species.|$|E
5|$|Compsognathus were small, bipedal {{animals with}} long hind legs and longer tails, which they used for balance during <b>locomotion.</b> The forelimbs were {{smaller than the}} hindlimbs and {{featured}} three digits equipped with solid claws suited for grasping prey. Their delicate skulls were narrow and long, with tapered snouts. The skull had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings), the largest of which was for the orbit (eye socket). The eyes were large {{in proportion to the}} rest of the skull.|$|E
5|$|Cross-country {{skiing is}} a form of skiing where skiers rely on their own <b>locomotion</b> to move across snow-covered terrain, rather than using ski lifts or other forms of assistance. Cross-country skiing is widely practiced as a sport and {{recreational}} activity; however, some still use it as a means of transportation. Variants of cross-country skiing are adapted to a range of terrain which spans unimproved, sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed courses that are specifically designed for the sport.|$|E
5|$|From 1980 on, {{a better}} {{understanding}} of dinosaur biomechanics, and studies by palaeontologists Andreas Christian and Holger Preuschoft on the resistance to bending of the back of Plateosaurus, led to widespread acceptance of an erect, digitigrade limb posture and a roughly horizontal position of the back. Many researchers were of the opinion that Plateosaurus could use both quadrupedal gaits (for slow speeds) and bipedal gaits (for rapid <b>locomotion),</b> and Wellnhofer insisted that the tail curved strongly downward, making a bipedal posture impossible. However, Moser showed that the tail was in fact straight.|$|E
5|$|Heterodontosaurus is the eponymous {{and best}} known {{member of the}} family Heterodontosauridae. This family is {{considered}} one of the most primitive or basal groups within the order of ornithischian dinosaurs. In spite of the large tusks, Heterodontosaurus is thought to have been herbivorous, or at least omnivorous. Though it was formerly thought to have been capable of quadrupedal <b>locomotion,</b> it is now thought to have been bipedal. Tooth replacement was sporadic and not continuous, unlike its relatives. At least four other heterodontosaurid genera are known from the same geological formations as Heterodontosaurus.|$|E
5|$|In January 2012, {{the federal}} {{government}} of Brazil enacted the Urban Mobility Law that authorizes municipalities to implement congestion pricing to reduce traffic flows. The law also seeks to {{encourage the use of}} public transportation and reduce air pollution. According to the law, revenues from congestion charges should be destined exclusively to urban infrastructure for public transportation and non-motorized modes of <b>locomotion</b> (such as walking and cycling), and to finance public subsidies to transit fares. The law went into effect in April 2013.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} tetrapods, the gastralia and ribs with uncinate processes, {{together}} with bony {{elements such as}} bony plates in the skin (osteoderms) and clavicles (collar bone), would have formed a sort of exoskeleton around the body, protecting the belly and helping to hold in the guts and inner organs. These anatomical details most likely evolved from structures involved in <b>locomotion</b> even before the vertebrates ventured onto land. The gastralia {{may have been involved}} in the breathing process in early amphibians and reptiles. The pelvis and shoulder girdles are arranged differently from those of lizards, as is the case with other parts of the internal anatomy and its scales.|$|E
5|$|Larval ticks hatch {{with six}} legs, {{acquiring}} {{the other two}} after a blood meal and molting into the nymph stage. In the nymphal and adult stages, ticks have eight legs, {{each of which has}} seven segments and is tipped with a pair of claws. The legs are sometimes ornamented and usually bear sensory or tactile hairs. In addition to being used for <b>locomotion,</b> the tarsus of leg I contains a unique sensory structure, Haller's organ, which can detect odors and chemicals emanating from the host, as well as sensing changes in temperature and air currents. When not being used for walking, the legs remain tightly folded against the body.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have adapted}} to fill many open {{ecological}} niches since making their way to Madagascar. Their diversity in both behavior and morphology (outward appearance) rivals that of the monkeys and apes found elsewhere in the world. Ranging in size from the 30g (1.1oz) Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, the world's smallest primate, to the recently extinct 160–200kg (350–440lb) Archaeoindris fontoynonti, lemurs evolved diverse forms of <b>locomotion,</b> varying levels of social complexity, and unique adaptations to the local climate.|$|E
