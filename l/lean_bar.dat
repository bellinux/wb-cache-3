60|$|Men {{and women}} sat round the tables or <b>leaned</b> against the <b>bars</b> {{discussing}} the situation: every one, of course, had a theory to put forward, or a suggestion to offer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Two beers," [...] said I nonchalantly to the barkeeper, {{and while}} he drew them, the Swede and I <b>leaned</b> against the <b>bar</b> and yearned {{secretly}} for the arm-chairs by the stove.|$|R
6000|$|... "C'rect," [...] {{said the}} bartender, {{smoothing}} the twelve one-dollar notes. The crowd surged around Billy McMahan again. Some one was telling how Brannigan fixed 'em {{over in the}} Eleventh. Ikey <b>leaned</b> against the <b>bar</b> a while, and then went out.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't believe Miriam will {{be content}} to sit still and watch anybody," [...] replied Ralph. [...] "I wonder where she can be;" [...] and twice he called her, once {{directing}} his voice up toward the haymows and once {{out into the open}} air. Dora still <b>leaned</b> on the <b>bar</b> and looked out.|$|R
60|$|Whether or not Dora {{would have}} enjoyed all this as much {{had she been}} alone is a point not {{necessary}} to settle, {{but she was a}} true country girl, and had loved chickens, barns, and hay from her babyhood up. She stepped quickly to the open door, and she and Ralph <b>leaned</b> upon the <b>bar</b> and looked out upon the beautiful scene.|$|R
60|$|Then {{witnesses}} were called. The {{first of these}} was the fourth man whom Irene had set upon me, who alone escaped with a wound behind. This fellow, having been carried into court, for he could not walk, <b>leaned</b> over a <b>bar,</b> for he could not sit down, and told his story. When he had finished I was allowed to examine him.|$|R
60|$|We {{talked and}} lingered at the bar. It {{seemed to me}} strange that we lingered. We had had our beer. But who was I {{to lead the way}} outside when great Nelson chose to <b>lean</b> against the <b>bar?</b> After a few minutes, to my surprise, he asked me to have another drink, which I did. And still we talked, and Nelson evinced no {{intention}} of leaving the bar.|$|R
60|$|The young officer <b>leans</b> {{against the}} <b>bar,</b> {{and listens to}} stories by Mr. Ford, which it behooves no church members to hear. He smokes Mr. Hopper's cigar and drinks his whiskey. And Eliphalet understands that the good Lord put some fools into the world {{in order to give}} the smart people a chance to {{practise}} their talents. Mr. Hopper neither drinks nor smokes, but he uses the spittoon with more freedom in this atmosphere.|$|R
6000|$|The prostration of Silas, at {{the close}} of the inquiry, was so complete, that it was found {{necessary}} to have two men to support him on his leaving the court. Ambrose <b>leaned</b> over the <b>bar</b> to speak to Naomi before he followed the jailer out. [...] "Wait," [...] he whispered, confidently, [...] "till they hear what I have to say!" [...] Naomi kissed her hand to him affectionately, and turned to me with the bright tears in her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|French Frank, who, {{unknown to}} me, had {{swallowed}} his chagrin {{since the day}} before, now that {{the money for the}} Razzle Dazzle was in his pocket, began to behave curiously toward me. I sensed the change in his attitude, saw the forbidding glitter in his eyes, and wondered. The more I saw of men, the queerer they became. Johnny Heinhold <b>leaned</b> across the <b>bar</b> and whispered in my ear, [...] "He's got it in for you. Watch out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Playing truant and stealing. He stole right enough--stole {{the money}} from an old woman, and what was I to do {{when it came to}} the trial but say what I knew. And him like a viper a-looking at me--more like a viper than a human boy. He <b>leans</b> on the <b>bar</b> and looks at me. 'All right, Aunt Flo,' he says, just that and nothing more. Time after time, I've dreamt of it, and now he's come. 'They've Reformed me,' he says, 'and made me a devil, and devil I mean to be to you. So out with it,' he says." ...|$|R
5000|$|Queuing (getting in line/forming a line) is {{expected}} {{when there is}} any demand for an item and is, like saying please and thank you, considered basic manners. Queues are formed on a first there first in line basis. The only exception to this is a pub where people will normally <b>lean</b> on the <b>bar</b> to wait but you {{should be aware of}} who is waiting ahead of you because it is rude to accept service from a barman before someone who has been waiting longer. A simple nod or subtle gesture towards the person who has waited longer will be understood by any experienced server to mean that the indicated person was before you.|$|R
60|$|The road to Lorette {{is through}} St. John's Gate, {{down into the}} {{outlying}} meadows and rye-fields, where, crossing and recrossing the swift St. Charles, it finally rises at Lorette above {{the level of the}} citadel. It is a lonelier road than that to Montmorenci, and the scattering cottages upon it have not the well-to-do prettiness, the operatic repair, of stone-built Beauport. But they are charming, nevertheless, and the people seem to be remoter from modern influences. Peasant-girls, in purple gowns and broad straw hats, and not the fashions of the year before last, now and then appeared to our acquaintance; near one ancient cottage an old man, in the true habitant's red woollen cap with a long fall, <b>leaned</b> over the <b>bars</b> of his gate and smoked a short pipe.|$|R
50|$|At 22:12 CEST (20:12 UTC), a bomb {{exploded}} outside Eugens Weinstube (Eugene's Wine Bar) in Ansbach, Germany and injured fifteen people, four seriously. The explosion occurred {{near the entrance}} to the Ansbach Open music festival with around 2,500 people in attendance. It was initially thought to have been caused by a gas leak. Daleel was communicating with someone online immediately before the blast. Daleel was in communication with a telephone number in Saudi Arabia minutes before the attack. He carried a backpack filled with screws, nails, and miscellaneous metal parts used in wood manufacturing and was denied entry into the music festival shortly before the blast because he had no ticket. Thereafter, witnesses say, Daleel sat outside Eugene's Wine <b>Bar,</b> <b>leaned</b> forward, and detonated an improvised explosive device. Emergency personnel arrived and attempted to resuscitate Daleel, but he was already dead.|$|R
6000|$|She {{gave him}} the money, copper by copper. The bar-parlour was already well filled. It had a sanded floor, benches round it, and yellow {{pictures}} of Victorian prize-fighters on the walls. The licencee knew all his customers by name, and he <b>leaned</b> over his <b>bar</b> smiling benignly at two young men who were throwing rings on a stick that stood up from the floor: their failure was greeted with {{a good deal of}} hearty chaff {{from the rest of the}} company. Room was made for the new arrivals. Philip found himself sitting between an old labourer in corduroys, with string tied under his knees, and a shiny-faced lad of seventeen with a love-lock neatly plastered on his red forehead. Athelny insisted on trying his hand at the throwing of rings. He backed himself for half a pint and won it. As he drank the loser's health he said: ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Gargantua the Great, wrote Gargantuan Columnist Heywood Broun {{three weeks}} ago, [...] "is the fiercest looking thing I {{have ever seen}} on two legs. And {{probably}} his power and truculence were all the more impressive because he did look a good deal like a distant relative. No one was allowed to go close to his cage, because Gargantua can reach about five feet through the bars and get a toe hold on a visitor whom he dislikes." [...] Gargantua {{may not be the}} world's biggest captive gorilla—since the death of Berlin Zoo's monster, many zoos have claimed that honor for their gorillas—but {{he is one of the}} most vindictive. Last week the circus' executive vice president, young John Ringling North, nephew of the late John ("Three-Ring") Ringling, was inspecting the circus' Sarasota, Fla. winter quarters. Imprudently disregarding warning signs, he <b>leaned</b> against the <b>bars</b> of Gargantua's cage to rest. Gargantua reached through, got no toe hold but wrenched Circusman North's left arm into the cage, bit & wrung it until Trainer Richard Kroner, pounding the gorilla with an iron stake, distracted its slow attention.|$|R
