5|$|The {{exact time}} of the <b>liftoff</b> varies from source to source and is {{mentioned}} as 05:30:42 Moscow Time or 07:22 Moscow Time.|$|E
5|$|During the launch, Launch Pad 39A {{sustained}} substantial damage, {{more than}} had been seen on any previous launch. Following <b>liftoff,</b> inspectors discovered that bricks and mortar from the launch pad's base had been thrown {{as far as the}} perimeter fence, a distance of 1,500 feet (457m).|$|E
5|$|Mission {{managers}} {{called up}} to the crew to alert them of the find, advising Altman ("Scooter") {{that one of the}} orbiter's wing leading edge sensors recorded a debris event during ascent, around 104 – 106 seconds following <b>liftoff,</b> which may have been the cause of the damage seen in that area.|$|E
5|$|At Cape Canaveral, {{the space}} shuttle Discovery was {{considered}} to be safe on its launching pad after concerns of unfavorable weather, and NASA rescheduled a <b>liftoff</b> the following week; however, shuttle managers eventually decided to begin moving Discovery from the launching pad to ride out the storm. In Miami, the Booker T. Washington Senior High School opened as a voluntary evacuation shelter for all pre-registered special needs residents. Also, the MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa evacuated its aircraft to McConnell Air Force Base near Wichita.|$|E
5|$|Each Space Shuttle {{had three}} RS-25 engines, {{installed}} in the aft structure of the Space Shuttle orbiter in the Orbiter Processing Facility prior to the orbiter being transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building. If necessary the engines could be changed on the pad. The engines, drawing propellant from the Space Shuttle external tank (ET) via the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS), were ignited at T−6.6 seconds prior to <b>liftoff</b> (with each ignition staggered by 120ms), which allowed their performance to be checked prior to ignition of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), which committed the shuttle to the launch. At launch, the engines would be operating at 100% RPL, throttling up to 104.5% immediately following <b>liftoff.</b> The engines would maintain this power level until around T+40 seconds, {{where they would be}} throttled back to around 70% to reduce aerodynamic loads on the shuttle stack as it passed through the region of maximum dynamic pressure, or max Q. The engines would then be throttled back up until around T+8 minutes, at which point they would be gradually throttled back down to 67% to prevent the stack exceeding 3g of acceleration as it became progressively lighter due to propellant consumption. The engines were then shut down, a procedure known as main engine cutoff (MECO), at around T+8.5 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Henderson and JPL {{director}} Bruce Ng {{prepare a}} space probe to deliver {{enough food to}} last Watney until Ares IV's arrival. When the Hab's airlock malfunctions due to a small puncture, it destroys Watney's crops. Sanders orders the team {{to speed up the}} supply mission with the Iris probe by skipping the safety inspections. However, an oversight causes the destabilization and subsequent explosion of the rocket 40 seconds after <b>liftoff,</b> causing Watney to think about his seemingly inevitable death.|$|E
5|$|Liquid Fly-back Booster (LFBB) was a German Aerospace Center's (DLR's) project {{concept to}} develop a {{reusable}} liquid rocket booster for Ariane 5 in order to significantly reduce a high cost of space transportation and increase environmental friendliness. LFBB would replace existing solid rocket boosters, providing main thrust during the <b>liftoff.</b> Once separated, two winged boosters would perform an atmospheric entry, fly back autonomously to the French Guiana, and land horizontally on the airport like an airplane.|$|E
5|$|Schirra {{was awakened}} at 1:40 am ET {{on the morning}} of October 3, and after a hearty breakfast—including a {{bluefish}} he had speared the day before—and a brief physical he left for the launchpad at around 4 am. He entered the spacecraft at 4:41 am ET, where he found a steak sandwich left for him in the 'glove compartment', and began the pre-launch checks. The launch countdown proceeded as planned until 6:15, when there was a 15-minute hold to allow the Canary Islands tracking station to repair a radar set. The countdown resumed at 6:30 and proceeded to booster ignition with no further delays. <b>Liftoff</b> proceeded smoothly, but there was a momentary clockwise roll transient at <b>liftoff,</b> which reached 7.83° per second and approached 80% of the required threshold to trigger the ASIS abort system. This was later identified as being due to a slight misalignment of the main engines and was kept under control by the booster's vernier thrusters. Sustainer engine thrust during the launch was slightly below normal and fuel consumption higher than normal due to a suspected leak in the sustainer fuel system.|$|E
5|$|According to a NASA document, Laika {{was placed}} in the capsule of the {{satellite}} on 31 October 1957—three days {{before the start of the}} mission. At that time of year, the temperatures at the launch site were extremely cold, and a hose connected to a heater was used to keep her container warm. Two assistants were assigned to keep a constant watch on Laika before launch. Just prior to <b>liftoff</b> on 3 November 1957, from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Laika's fur was sponged in a weak alcohol solution and carefully groomed, while iodine was painted onto the areas where sensors would be placed to monitor her bodily functions.|$|E
5|$|The {{contracted}} {{batch of}} 15 Saturn Vs were enough for lunar landing missions through Apollo 20. NASA publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites, {{with plans to}} increase {{the mass of the}} CSM and LM for the last five missions, along with the payload capacity of the Saturn V. These final missions would combine the I and J types in the 1967 list, allowing the CMP to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface, and allowing them to stay on the Moon for over three days. These missions would also carry the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) increasing the exploration area and allowing televised <b>liftoff</b> of the LM. Also, the Block II spacesuit was revised for the extended missions to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the LRV.|$|E
5|$|The capsule {{built for}} the mission, Mercury Spacecraft No. 16, had been {{delivered}} to Cape Canaveral on January 16, 1962. The Atlas LV-3B booster assigned to the mission, No. 113-D, was accepted by NASA at the Convair plant on July 27 and delivered on August 8. In late July, the launch date was set for September 18, but delays with the Atlas booster's delivery {{and a series of}} technical concerns with the safety of the rocket motors caused it to be pushed back several weeks. Some of this {{had to do with the}} modified propulsion system, but also concern over Atlas ICBM tests earlier in the year. There had been no Atlas failures caused by the turbopumps for almost three years, but in late 1961-early 1962, two static firing tests experienced pump failure and explosion of the engine, followed by an Atlas missile in April 1962 that exploded almost immediately at <b>liftoff</b> due to a failure of the sustainer turbopump. Analysis of these incidents failed to locate any specific cause for the pump explosions, but all of them occurred when running untested hardware modifications and during movement of the sustainer inlet valve to the flight-ready open position. It was thus decided to give MA-8's booster a thorough checkout before it could be deemed flight-worthy. On September 6, the tests were scheduled to continue until September 24, which allowed for a probable launch on October 3. A static firing test on the pad would expose the sustainer turbopump to the failure mode in question. This was carried out on September 8 and the booster reported as ready for assembly on September 18.|$|E
25|$|Apollo 12. The Saturn V rocket {{was struck}} by {{lightning}} shortly after <b>liftoff.</b>|$|E
25|$|Saturn Apollo flight {{profiles}} varied considerably by mission. All missions began, however, with <b>liftoff</b> under {{power of the}} first stage. To more smoothly control engine ignition, thrust buildup and <b>liftoff</b> of the vehicle, restraining arms provided support and hold down at four points {{around the base of}} the S-IC stage. A gradual controlled release was accomplished during the first six inches of vertical motion.|$|E
25|$|To control {{trajectory}} at <b>liftoff</b> and supersonic speeds, heat-resistant graphite vanes {{were used as}} rudders in the exhaust jet.|$|E
25|$|The {{disaster}} was {{the second}} fatal accident in the Space Shuttle program after Space Shuttle Challenger, which broke apart and killed the seven-member crew 73 seconds after <b>liftoff</b> in 1986.|$|E
25|$|The Earth Mission {{includes}} <b>liftoff</b> {{from the}} ISTC, an orbiting {{tour of the}} Earth, and a descent back to the ISTC that involves riders having to safely navigate through a thunderstorm over the landing runway.|$|E
25|$|The {{first flight}} from Soldier Field, with Settle alone on board, {{attracted}} thousands of spectators {{and ended in}} a flop. Moments after <b>liftoff,</b> an open gas release valve forced Century to fall in a nearby railroad yard.|$|E
25|$|The initial launch day weather {{forecast}} {{called for a}} 90% chance of favorable launch conditions. As the launch preparations continued, due to lower cloud cover ceilings it was changed to 70% and at <b>liftoff</b> to 80%.|$|E
25|$|On August 27, 2013, {{the first}} planned {{launch of the}} rocket had to be aborted 19 seconds before <b>liftoff</b> because of a botched data transmission. A {{ground-based}} computer had tried to receive data from the rocket 0.07 seconds before the information was actually transmitted.|$|E
25|$|Mission: Space (stylized as Mission: SPACE) is a {{centrifugal}} {{motion simulator}} thrill ride at Epcot in Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. It simulates what an astronaut might experience aboard a spacecraft {{on a mission}} to Mars, from the higher g-force of <b>liftoff</b> to the speculative hypersleep.|$|E
25|$|Influenced by the {{presence}} of the John F. Kennedy Space Center, Brevard County is also known as the Space Coast. As such, it was designated with the telephone area code 321, as in 3-2-1 <b>liftoff.</b> The county is named after Theodore Washington Brevard, an early Florida settler, and state comptroller.|$|E
25|$|When the {{helicopter}} landed, Cleland jumped out, {{followed by the}} two soldiers. They ducked beneath the rotors and turned to watch the <b>liftoff.</b> Cleland reached {{down to pick up}} a grenade that he believed had popped off his flak jacket. It exploded and the blast slammed him backward, shredding both his legs and one arm.|$|E
25|$|Endeavour {{served as}} the STS-400 rescue vehicle for STS-125, and was {{prepared}} for a possible <b>liftoff</b> from Launch Pad 39B on 15 May 2009, {{four days after the}} launch of STS-125. After Atlantis performed the late inspection and was cleared for re-entry, Endeavour was officially released from stand-by status on 21 May 2009, and preparations for STS-127 were initiated.|$|E
25|$|When Apollo 12 {{launched}} on November 14, 1969, Aaron was on shift. Thirty-six seconds after <b>liftoff,</b> the spacecraft {{was struck by}} lightning, causing a power surge. Instruments began to malfunction and telemetry data became garbled. The flight director, Gerry Griffin, expected {{that he would have}} to abort the mission. However, Aaron realized that he had previously seen this odd pattern of telemetry.|$|E
25|$|After final safety checks, {{the ground}} crew would {{fill up the}} second stage with liquid {{hydrogen}} (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LOX) fuel, and the crew, wearing all-purpose spacesuits, would enter the spacecraft three hours before <b>liftoff.</b> Once they were locked in, and after all systems were cleared by controllers at both the Cape and Mission Control in Houston, the Ares I would then launch.|$|E
25|$|The Mars Mission {{includes}} <b>liftoff</b> {{from the}} ISTC, a slingshot around the moon for a gravity-assisted boost, {{a brief period}} of simulated hypersleep (to pass the lengthy time required to reach Mars), and a descent for landing on the Martian surface, where riders manually control the vehicle with a joystick. As a training exercise, the mission contains several unexpected situations that add to the drama.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of the Leonardo MPLM by the Italian Space Agency commenced in April 1996. In August 1998, {{after the completion of}} primary construction, Leonardo was delivered to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). In March 2001, Leonardo made its first mission on Discovery as part of the STS-102 flight. The <b>liftoff</b> of Leonardo inside Discoverys payload bay on STS-102 marked the first of seven MPLM flights prior to STS-133.|$|E
25|$|The Instrument Unit {{was built}} by IBM and rode atop the third stage. It was {{constructed}} at the Space Systems Center in Huntsville, Alabama. This computer controlled {{the operations of the}} rocket from just before <b>liftoff</b> until the S-IVB was discarded. It included guidance and telemetry systems for the rocket. By measuring the acceleration and vehicle attitude, it could calculate the position and velocity of the rocket and correct for any deviations.|$|E
25|$|Despite these changes, the {{failures}} kept coming. After a six-month gap, Midas 5 orbited on April 9, 1962. The satellite reached orbit successfully, but experienced a massive power failure during the sixth orbit. Eight months later, Midas 6 lifted off (December 17) but {{never made it}} to orbit. At <b>liftoff,</b> an improper disconnect of the hydraulic rise-off caused loss of booster engine hydraulics fluid during ascent. The Atlas drifted off its flight path and the Range Safety destruct command was sent 82 seconds into the launch.|$|E
25|$|Instant abort {{capability}} {{was important}} because certain failure modes such as loss of thrust upon <b>liftoff</b> (for example the third Redstone test flight in May 1954) {{could result in}} an immediate catastrophic situation. Other failure modes such as deviation from the proper flight path or a drop in engine chamber pressure during ascent did not necessarily present an immediate risk to the astronaut's safety and he could either initial a manual abort by pulling a lever in the capsule to activate the Launch Escape System or ground control could send a command to activate it.|$|E
25|$|Pegasus 2 was a {{secondary}} payload on the carrier rocket, which {{was carrying a}} boilerplate Apollo spacecraft, Apollo 104 or BP-26, {{as part of a}} series of configuration tests for the Apollo program. The Apollo boilerplate acted as a payload fairing for the Pegasus spacecraft, which was stored inside what would have been the Service Module of a functional spacecraft. Upon reaching orbit, the boilerplate Command and Service modules were jettisoned. Boilerplate separation occurred 806 seconds after <b>liftoff,</b> with Pegasus 2's detectors being deployed one minute later. The predicted orbital lifetime of Pegasus 2 was 1220 days.|$|E
25|$|The first {{launch of}} an R-7 rocket (8K71 No.5L) {{occurred}} on 15 May 1957. A fire {{began in the}} Blok D strap-on almost immediately at <b>liftoff,</b> but the booster continued flying until T+98 seconds when the strap-on broke away and the vehicle crashed some 400km downrange. Three attempts to launch the second rocket (8K71 No.6) were made on 10–11 June, but an assembly defect prevented launch. The unsuccessful launch of the third R-7 rocket (8K71 No.7) took place on 12 July. An electrical short caused the vernier engines to put the missile into an uncontrolled roll which resulted {{in all of the}} strap-ons separating 33 seconds into the launch. The R-7 crashed about 7km from the pad.|$|E
25|$|The launch {{came very}} close to failure—a postflight {{examination}} of telemetry data found that the Blok G strap-on had not attained full power at ignition and the resulting imbalanced thrust caused the booster to pitch over about 2° six seconds after <b>liftoff.</b> Two seconds later, the flight control system tried to compensate by rapidly moving the vernier engines and stabilizer fins. The Blok G strap-on finally reached 100% thrust only one second before the pitch angle would have been great enough to trigger an automatic shutdown command, which would have terminated the launch and sent the R-7 and Sputnik 1 crashing to the ground in a fireball only a short distance from the pad.|$|E
25|$|Kranz {{continued}} as a Flight Director through Apollo 17, {{when he worked}} his last shift as a flight director overseeing the mission <b>liftoff,</b> and then was promoted to Deputy Director of NASA Mission Operations in 1974, becoming Director in 1983. He was in Mission Control during the January 28, 1986 loss of Space Shuttle Challenger on the STS-51-L launch. He retired from NASA in 1994 after the successful STS-61 flight that repaired the optically flawed Hubble Space Telescope in 1993. In addition to having written Failure Is Not an Option, which was adapted for The History Channel in 2004, he also flies an aerobatic aircraft {{and serves as a}} flight engineer for a restored Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress.|$|E
25|$|Once in Chile {{the crew}} had serious {{difficulties}} with the generation of hydrogen, due to the accidental loss {{of most of the}} sulfuric acid imported from Argentina. Bradley decided to resort to coal gas, produced in Chile and readily available, with a high percentage of hydrogen. The odyssey would have been impossible without the cooperation of Chilean authorities, who responded more favorably to Bradley's request for support than did officials in his native Argentina. The crossing of the Andes on an aerostat filled with coal gas was finally accomplished on June 24, 1916. At an altitude of 8,100m, the temperature dropped to -30°C. The adventure lasted {{three and a half hours}} from the moment of <b>liftoff</b> in Santiago to the landing in Cerro de la Cepa, Uspallata, Mendoza, Argentina. Bradley and Zuloaga were welcomed in Argentina as national heroes.|$|E
25|$|On February 7, 1981, the Beechcraft Bonanza A36TC Wozniak was {{piloting}} crashed {{soon after}} takeoff from the Sky Park Airport in Scotts Valley, California. The plane stalled while climbing, then bounced down the runway, went through two fences, {{and crashed into}} an embankment. Wozniak and his three passengers—then-fiancée Candice Clark, his brother, and his girlfriend—were injured. Wozniak sustained severe face and head injuries, including losing a tooth, and also suffered for five weeks after the crash from anterograde amnesia, the inability to create new memories. He had no memory of the crash, and did not remember {{his name in the}} hospital or the things he did after he was released. He would later state that Apple II computer games are what helped him regain his memory. The National Transportation Safety Board investigation report cited premature <b>liftoff</b> and pilot inexperience as probable causes of the crash.|$|E
