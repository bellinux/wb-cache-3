5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the move from Zeus to Nike-X was concern that the Zeus radars would not be able to tell the {{difference}} between the warhead and a decoy until it was too late to launch. One solution to this problem was the Sprint missile, which had the performance required to wait until decluttering was complete. Another potential solution was to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> sort of signature of the reentry through the highest levels of the atmosphere that might differ between a warhead and decoy; specifically, it appeared that the ablation of the heat shield might produce a clear signature pointing out the warhead.|$|E
5|$|When {{you were}} hungry, {{you began to}} cry, because you could not speak. You were seven months without teeth, always sucking. But after you got one, you began to gnaw a crust of bread. It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> other milk.|$|E
25|$|People grew richer {{entering}} the 1970s. Not surprisingly, {{people started to}} <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> means of investment. The passing of Banking Ordinance of 1964 would begin the tightening up of banks. A minimum capital of HKD 5million and liquidity ratio of 25% and limitation on loans and investments became the new requirements to open a legit institution. People began to have more trust in their banks, and the accumulation of savings led to people's willingness to invest.|$|E

25|$|We have {{to adjust}} the AMT. That has to be reduced. We {{have to get rid}} of the death tax, which is going to go to zero in 2010, which is going to create an {{incentive}} – I can't imagine what kind of an incentive it's going to create. It's going to go to zero in 2010. And then in 2011, it's going to go to 55 percent. And we have to make sure that the tax cuts that went into effect, that that level remains. Otherwise, we're going to have one of the biggest tax increases in history in 2011. And I would look to try to regularize the rates and <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> marginal reduction, even beyond what we're doing right now.|$|E

Hamilton as saying: [...] "We don't know who authorized [...] We've asked that question 50 times." [...] A May 26 article in The Hill quoted another Commission member, Tim Roemer, as being unconvinced by Clarke's claim of sole responsibility for approving the flights: [...] "It doesn't seem that Richard Clarke had enough information to clear it... I just don't think that the questions are resolved, {{and we need to}} dig deeper... Clarke sure didn't seem {{to say that he was}} the final decisionmaker. I believe we need to continue to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> more answers." ...|$|E
