40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} allocation {{problems that}} arise {{in the context of}} service allocation in Clouds. More specifically, we assume on the one part that each computing resource is associated to a capacity constraint, that can be chosen using Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) method, and to a probability of failure. On the other hand, we assume that the service runs as a set of independent instances of identical Virtual Machines. Moreover, there exists a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the Cloud provider and the client that can be expressed as follows: the client comes with a minimal number of service instances which must be alive {{at the end of the}} day, and the Cloud provider offers a list of pairs (price,compensation), this compensation being paid by the Cloud provider if it fails to keep alive the required number of services. On the Cloud provider side, each pair corresponds actually to a guaranteed success probability of fulfilling the constraint on the minimal number of instances. In this context, given a minimal number of instances and a probability of success, the question for the Cloud provider is to find the number of necessary resources, their clock frequency and an allocation of the instances (possibly using replication) onto machines. This solution should satisfy all types of constraints during a given time period while minimizing the energy consumption of used resources. We consider two energy consumption models based on DVFS techniques, where the clock frequency of physical resources can be changed. For each allocation problem and each energy model, we prove deterministic approximation ratios on the consumed energy for algorithms that provide guaranteed probability failures, as well as an efficient heuristic, whose energy ratio is not guaranteed.

Eight female cunner were monitored at various times from June 17 to November 24, 1991, providing 107 days of tracking. The tracking system provided positional information on individual cunner at 15 - second intervals. Ultrasonic transmitters had an average life of 17 days. Transmitters were attached externally through the dorsal musculature. Transmitters had no adverse effect on equilibrium or swimming ability and produced no detectable changes in female activity or movement. [...] Fish were active diurnally, commencing activity on average 55 minutes after sunrise and ceasing activity about 60 minutes after sunset. Fish were assumed active whenever positional information was obtained on movement. The active period, ranging from 11 to 16. 5 hrs, corresponded to the interim between daily onset and cessation of activity and was interrupted by periods of inactivity lasting between 5 and 15 minutes. Several factors influenced the activity of female cunner. As daylength shortened, cunner had a corresponding decrease in the duration of their diurnal activity. Increases in water temperature resulted in {{a decrease in the}} length of inactivity bouts. At temperatures below 5 °C cunner seek shelter and remain inactive. During increased surface waves cunner remained inactive for longer periods of time. [...] Activity was uninfluenced by cloud cover and tidal cycle. Activity did not differ between morning and afternoon observations, but over the observation period between June and November inactivity bouts became more numerous and lasted for longer periods. [...] Female cunner exhibited limited movements, remaining within 80 m of their original point of capture. The home range areas of 8 female cunner ranged in size from 300 to 2353 m². Females utilized space disproportionately within the boundaries of their home ranges, spending 60 % of their time in 30 % of their home range. [...] As water temperatures increased, both on a daily and seasonal basis, females occupied smaller home ranges. Home range areas were larger during the afternoon than the morning. Size of home range areas were not affected by sea state, but increased as cloud cover increased. Seasonally the largest home ranges occurred in June-July, followed by October-November, and lastly August-September. [...] While daily changes in environmental variables (<b>Le.</b> Water temperature, <b>cloud</b> cover, and sea state) affect activity and movement patterns of female cunner, changing energetic requirements associated with spawning and overwintering torpor appear to play a more important role...|$|R
40|$|Hashing and {{hash-based}} data {{structures are}} ubiquitous. Apart from their role inthe design of efficient algorithms, they particularly form the core to manycritical software applications. Whether {{it be in}} authentication on theInternet, integrity/identification of files, payment using Bitcoins, webproxies, or anti-viruses, the use of hashing algorithms might only be internalbut yet very pervasive. This dissertation studies the pitfalls of employing hashing and hash-based datastructures in software applications, {{with a focus on}} their security and privacyimplications. The mainstay of this dissertation is the security and privacyanalysis of software solutions built atop Bloom filters [...] - a popularhash-based data structure, and Safe Browsing [...] - a malicious websitedetection tool developed by Google that uses hash functions. The softwaresolutions studied in this dissertation have billions of clients, which includesoftware developers and end users. For Bloom filters and their privacy, we study a novel use case, where they forman essential tool to privately query leaked databases of personal data. Whilefor security, we study Bloom filters in adversarial settings. The studyencompasses both theory and practice. From a theoretical standpoint, we defineadversary models that capture the different access privileges of an adversary onBloom filters. We put the theory into practice by identifying several securityrelated software solutions (employing Bloom filters) that are vulnerable to ourattacks. This includes: a web crawler, a web proxy, a malware filter, forensictools and an intrusion detection system. Our attacks are similar to traditionaldenial-of-service attacks capable of bringing the concerned infrastructures toknees. As for Safe Browsing, we study vulnerabilities in the architecture that anadversary can exploit. We show several attacks that can simultaneouslyincrease traffic towards both the Safe Browsing server and the client. Ourattacks are highly feasible as they essentially require inverting hash digestsof 32 bits. We also study the privacy achieved by the service by analyzing thepossibility of re-identifying websites visited by a client. Our analysis andexperimental results show that Safe Browsing can potentially be used as a toolto track specific classes of individuals. This dissertation highlights the misunderstandings related to the use of hashingand hash-based data structures in a security and privacy context. Thesemisunderstandings are the geneses of several malpractices that include the useof insecure hash functions, digest truncation among others. Motivated by ourfindings, we further explore several countermeasures to mitigate the ensuingsecurity and privacy risks.

40|$|Clouds play {{a crucial}} role in {{modulating}} energy trading system Earth-atmosphere. Indeed, they reflect some solar radiation contributing thus cooling the atmosphere, they trap some of the infrared radiation LAND contributing to global warming. The competition between these two effects opposite is governed by the physical and microphysical properties of clouds. In general low clouds with their low altitudes and high optical depths reflect more solar radiation and thus have a cooling trend. For cons, the cirrus clouds because of their low optical depths are relatively transparent to solar radiation and simultaneously capture a portion of long wave radiation re-emit infrared and to the ground contributing to the warming of the atmosphere and Earth's surface. The study of climate and its evolution, climate models, requires a good handling account the radiative effects of clouds. For now, the determination of the radiative effects has been identified by the IPCC, "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change" as one of the main sources of uncertainty in climate prediction. The radiative impact of cirrus clouds (clouds of high altitudes) is particularly poorly taken into account in some models because of the extreme variability of sizes and shapes of crystals ice clouds. Indeed, in some models, the size distribution and shape these crystals is replaced by an effective diameter assuming the crystals form spherical. Studies of Kristjansson et al. (2000) on the sensitivity of two models environment to assumptions about the microphysical properties of cirrus clouds have shown that resulting uncertainty on the radiative effect associated with a doubling of the concentration Atmospheric carbon dioxide is about 50 %. The results of such studies explain the motivation of the scientific community to deepen our knowledge about the microphysics of clouds. Only observation of the properties of cirrus clouds at different scales to understand, and therefore better represent their impact on climate. Satellite observations offer opportunity to study the properties of cirrus clouds on a global scale and over long periods time. Pollsters TOVS (TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder-N) aboard platforms of NOAA have already demonstrated their ability to return properties natural (altitude, temperature and emissivity) and microphysical (size of the crystals and thick ice) cirrus thanks to their good spectral resolution in heat. The work of my thesis took place in the European project CIRAMOSA (Cirrus microphysical properties and Their Effect on Radiation: survey and integration Into climate Model From a combination of satellite observations), a collaboration between the Laboratory Dynamic Meteorology, the MetOffice at Exeter in Great Britain, the Institute for Marine Research in Kiel, Germany and the Laboratory of Atmospheric Optics in Lille. This project aimed to study the physical and microphysical properties of cirrus clouds to from satellite observations of different instruments as well as in situ measurements. The correlations between the microphysical properties of cirrus and the state of the atmosphere have been Demonstrated global scale, which will contribute to improved parameterizations microphysical properties of cirrus in climate models to better evaluation of their radiative effects. The LMD has participated in this project by developing a database of properties climate physical and microphysical cirrus clouds from measurements of vertical TOVS sounders. This climatology is the first of its kind. The first step of my thesis (Chapter 2) is devoted to the evaluation of the altitude of cloud base climate TOVS Path-B, a very important variable for calculation of radiative fluxes. For this evaluation I combined the data with TOVS Path-B LITE lidar observations close in time and space. This analysis showed that General altitude cloud TOVS Path-B corresponds to the middle of a cloud. The agreement best for low clouds than for high clouds. These are usually the one hand more heterogeneous and on the other hand, in the case of a cloud underlying the vertical structure of cloud top appears to be different (with a maximum signal backscatter above). In the latter case, on average, the altitude of a cloud of TOVS Path-B is underestimated by about 700 m. In a second step (Chapter 3), I am interested in studying correlations between microphysical properties of cirrus and the state of the atmosphere. The spatio-temporal brought into play by the physical processes of cloud formation are characterized by a wide spectrum of variability. However, the spatial and temporal resolution of climate models is reduced and does not take into account such variability. Therefore it is necessary to develop parameterizations for representing these microphysical properties in climate models. Design and development of these parameterizations require an understanding of interrelationships between microphysics clouds and the generation process of these clouds. So far the correlation between microphysical properties of clouds and the state of the atmosphere have been studied in campaigns in-situ measurements and hence in areas and for limited periods. The database TOVS Path-B microphysical properties of cirrus clouds, with its cover comprehensive and lasting four years, has allowed us to study across the globe consistency of these correlations identified in regional campaigns. In some number of climate models, the effective size of ice crystals or ice thickness cirrus clouds are parameterized according to the temperature of cloud. Our analysis with TOVS Path-B data have shown that this correlation does not exist globally. For go further, I sought to study the effect of the dynamics and thermodynamics of the atmosphere on the microphysical properties of cirrus clouds. For this study, I combined the properties of cirrus TOVS Path-B with the parameters of atmospheric re-analysis of ECMWF. Our studies have demonstrated the important role played by the wind (horizontal and vertical) and the humidity in the modulation of the microphysical properties of cirrus clouds. In general, in situations of strong vertical winds, horizontal cirrus have a size actual ice crystals rather low. Similarly, the thickness of cirrus ice bathing in a humid atmosphere containing strong updrafts are rather large. The last part of my thesis (Chapter 4) is dedicated to the study of coherence parameterizations of scattering properties of ice crystals between the thermal and the solar field. These scattering properties depend on the actual size of the crystals ice, the shape of the crystals and the wavelength. The non-regular forms of ice crystals of cirrus clouds that treatment of the diffusion and absorption radiation by these crystals can be done by approximate methods. We determined the radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere in the presence of cirrus clouds from radiative transfer model used in the model of the British climate MetOffice. The physical properties of cirrus clouds from TOVS Path-B, and the properties microphysics derived from measurements in the thermal field, were used to calculate albedos, which then were compared with observed albedo of cirrus clouds. These latter were determined by the radiometer ScaRaB. Three parameterizations of properties Dissemination of ice crystals were tested. These parameterizations have been developed from different physical principles and different assumptions about the shape of ice crystals. Assuming shaped crystals of hexagonal columns (Fu, 1998) observations are in agreement with the calculations for thin cirrus clouds in ice. The albedos calculated from the parameterization of Baran (2003) for crystals in aggregates are much better agreement with the observed albedos provided that the effective diameter of the crystals increases with the thickness of ice in cirrus <b>clouds.</b> <b>Les</b> nuages jouent un rôle capital dans la modulation des échanges énergétiques du système terre-atmosphère. En effet, ils réfléchissent une partie du rayonnement solaire contribuant ainsi au refroidissement de l'atmosphère, et ils piègent une partie du rayonnement infrarouge terrestre contribuant ainsi au réchauffement de la terre. La compétition entre ces deux effets opposés est gouvernée par les propriétés physiques et microphysiques des nuages. En général, les nuages bas avec leurs faibles altitudes et leurs fortes épaisseurs optiques réfléchissent davantage de rayonnement solaire et ont ainsi une tendance au refroidissement. Par contre, les cirrus, à cause de leurs faibles épaisseurs optiques, sont relativement transparents au rayonnement solaire et en même temps captent une partie du rayonnement tellurique infrarouge et le réémettent vers le sol contribuant ainsi au réchauffement de l'atmosphère et de la surface terrestre. L'étude du climat et de son évolution, par les modèles de climat, nécessite une bonne prise en compte des effets radiatifs des nuages. Pour le moment, la détermination de ces effets radiatifs a été identifiée par le IPCC « Panel Intergouvernemental sur le changement de climat » comme l'une des sources principale d'incertitude sur la prédiction du climat. L'impact radiatif des cirrus (nuages des hautes altitudes) est en particulier mal pris en compte dans certains modèles à cause de l'extrême variabilité des tailles et formes des cristaux de glace de ces nuages. En effet, dans certains modèles, la distribution de taille et de forme de ces cristaux est remplacée par un diamètre effectif en supposant les cristaux de forme sphérique. Des études de Kristjansson et al. (2000) sur la sensibilité de deux modèles de climat aux hypothèses sur les propriétés microphysiques des cirrus ont montré que l'incertitude résultante sur l'effet radiatif associé à un doublement de la concentration atmosphérique en dioxyde de carbone est de l'ordre de 50 %.
