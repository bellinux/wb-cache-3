5|$|By a 5–4 margin, {{the justices}} {{reversed}} the conviction, agreeing that Jacobson had been entrapped, on April 6, 1992. It {{has since been}} reported that {{this was one of}} the rare cases where the decision changed after arguments. The original poll of the justices showed a 7–2 majority for affirmance, with only White and Stevens holding out. But White argued persuasively for reversal to his fellow Justices, and Blackmun and Clarence Thomas, who had replaced Marshall, changed their minds. It has been suggested that Thomas, who later established a reputation for allowing wide <b>latitude</b> <b>to</b> law enforcement similar to other contemporary Republican appointees, was especially sensitive at that time to Jacobson's situation due to the sexual harassment allegations raised by Anita Hill during his own recent confirmation hearings.|$|E

5|$|The second {{determining}} event, {{the decisive}} French {{victory at the}} Battle of Austerlitz over the combined Russian and Austrian armies, forced the Austrian withdrawal from the Coalition. The subsequent Peace of Pressburg, signed on 26 December 1805, reinforced the earlier treaties of Campo Formio and Lunéville. Furthermore, Austria ceded land to Napoleon's German allies, and paid an indemnity of 40million francs. Victory at Austerlitz also gave Napoleon the <b>latitude</b> <b>to</b> create a buffer zone of German states between France and the states of Prussia, Russia, and Austria. These measures did not establish a lasting peace on the continent.

The value of ξ is the astronomic latitude minus the geodetic latitude (taking north <b>latitudes</b> <b>to</b> be positive and south <b>latitudes</b> <b>to</b> be negative); {{the latter is}} usually calculated by geodetic network coordinates. The value of η is the astronomic longitude minus the geodetic longitude (taking east longitudes to be positive and west longitudes to be negative). When a new mapping datum replaces the old, with new geodetic latitudes and longitudes on a new ellipsoid, the calculated vertical deflections will change too.|$|R
40|$|We {{retrieved}} global distributions {{and optical}} properties of stratospheric aerosols on Jupiter from ground-based NIR spectra and multiple-phase-angle images from Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS). A high-latitude haze layer {{is located at}} ∼ 10 – 20 mbar, {{higher than in the}} middle and low latitudes (∼ 50 mbar). Compact sub-micron particles are mainly located in the low latitudes between 40 °S and 25 °N with the particle radius between 0. 2 and 0. 5 μm. The rest of the stratosphere is covered by the particles known as fractal aggregates. In the nominal case with the imaginary part of the UV refractive index 0. 02, the fractal aggregates are composed of about a thousand 10 -nm-size monomers. The column density of the aerosols at pressure less than 100 mbar ranges from ∼ 10 ^ 7 cm^(− 2) at low <b>latitudes</b> <b>to</b> ∼ 10 ^ 9 cm^(− 2) at high latitudes. The mass loading of aerosols in the stratosphere is ∼ 10 ^(− 6) g cm^(− 2) at low <b>latitudes</b> <b>to</b> ∼ 10 ^(− 4) g cm^(− 2) in the high latitudes. Multiple solutions due to the uncertainty of the imaginary part of the refractive index are discussed. The stratospheric haze optical depths increase from ∼ 0. 03 at low <b>latitudes</b> <b>to</b> about a few at high latitudes in the UV wavelength (∼ 0. 26 μm), and from ∼ 0. 03 at low <b>latitudes</b> <b>to</b> ∼ 0. 1 at high latitudes in the NIR wavelength (∼ 0. 9 μm) ...|$|R

30|$|Angiosperms of Group G {{have not}} been {{observed}} at tropical or subtropical ecoregions in Asian continent.

Migration of plants from northern <b>to</b> southern <b>latitudes</b> might have been caused by global cooling in the late Tertiary and Quaternary that had forced many plants to migrate southward (Chung et al. 2011; Denk 2004; Huang and Lin 2006; Huang et al. 2004).
