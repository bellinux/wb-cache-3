The swirling nebula was created by injecting a <b>latex</b> <b>rubber</b> and ammonia mixture into a cloud tank filled with fresh and salt water. All the footage was shot at two frames per second to give the illusion of faster movement. The vibrant abstract colors of the nebula were simulated by lighting the tank using colored gels. Additional light effects such as auroras were created by the ILM animation department. Using matte work, the ships were physically stuck on a background plate to complete the shot. The destruction of the Reliants engine nacelle was created by superimposing shots of the engine blowing apart and explosions over the model.|$|E

40|$|THE NEW SAFE LATEX Vystar Corporation {{announced}} that Revertex Malaysia {{has signed a}} letter of intent to produce Vytex, the new safe <b>latex.</b> Vytex natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> represents a dramatic breakthrough {{in the search for}} a natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> in which the antigenic proteins that trigger allergic reactions are deactivated without reducing elasticity. Vytex natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> is produced through a proprietary process that deactivates antigenic proteins in latex, potentially making it safe for use by most people who are allergenic-protein sensitive, the Atlanta-based company said. According to Vystar President William Doyle, the plan is to scale up to production of Vytex natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> by next year. This would mean that products made of the revolutionary all-natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> could be reaching the market in 2007.

40|$|In {{addition}} to immediate type I allergy symptoms, natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> allergy may manifest as protein contact dermatitis on {{the hands of}} health-care workers and other natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> glove users. We examined whether repeated application of natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> on mouse skin causes sensitization to natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> and dermatitis. Epicutaneous sensitization with natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> produced a significant influx of mononuclear cells, CD 4 + CD 3 + cells, and eosinophils to the sensitized skin sites. The number of degranulated mast cells in natural rubber latex-sensitized skin sites was significantly higher compared with control sites treated with phosphate-buffered saline. The expression of interleukin- 1 β and interleukin- 4 mRNA was markedly increased in natural rubber latex-sensitized skin sites. Moreover, significant increases in the mRNA expression of chemokines CCL 2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1), CCL 11 (eotaxin- 1), CCL 3 (macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 α), and CCL 4 (macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 β) were found. In {{addition to}} the cutaneous inflammatory response, epicutaneous sensitization with natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> induced a striking increase in the total and specific immunoglobulin E levels {{but not in the}} immunoglobulin G 2 a levels. Intraperitoneal immunization with natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> induced a strong natural rubber latex-specific immunoglobulin G 2 a response, but only a weak immunoglobulin E response. We also studied the role of two major natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> allergens, the highly hydrophilic prohevein and the hydrophobic rubber elongation factor. Cutaneous application of natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> elicited a strong immunoglobulin E response against prohevein, but not against rubber elongation factor. On the contrary, intraperitoneal immunization with natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> elicited strong immunoglobulin G 2 a production to rubber elongation factor but not to prohevein. These results demonstrate that epicutaneous sensitization with natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> induces T helper 2 -dominated dermal inflammation and strong immunoglobulin E response in this murine model of natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> induced protein contact dermatitis. Epicutaneous sensitization to natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> proteins eluting from latex gloves may therefore {{contribute to the development of}} hand dermatitis and also natural rubber latex-specific immunoglobulin E antibodies...|$|R

25|$|South America {{remained}} {{the main source}} of the limited amounts of <b>latex</b> <b>rubber</b> used during much of the 19th century.

25|$|<b>Latex,</b> <b>rubber</b> {{suspended}} in water, {{was invented in}} 1920. Youngs Rubber Company {{was the first to}} manufacture a latex condom, an improved version of their Trojan brand. Latex condoms required less labor to produce than cement-dipped rubber condoms, which had to be smoothed by rubbing and trimming. Because it used water to suspend the rubber instead of gasoline and benzene, it eliminated the fire hazard previously associated with all condom factories. Latex condoms also performed better for the consumer: they were stronger and thinner than rubber condoms, and had a shelf life of five years (compared to three months for rubber). Europe's first latex condom was an export from Youngs Rubber Company in 1929. In 1932 the London Rubber Company, which had previously served as a wholesaler for German-manufactured condoms, became Europe's first manufacturer of latex condoms, the Durex.|$|E

40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to {{evaluate}} natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> - filler interaction. 1800 - peel test of flexible to rigid joints was performed to determine the peel strength of natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> -kaolin joints in order to evaluate the interaction of natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> with standard <b>rubber</b> grade kaolin and activated one by ion exchange reaction with amino -functional derivatives. Experimented natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> compounds were pre vulcanized with sulphur and ionization radiation. Radiation vulcanization was performed using 60 Co source irradiator, originally designed for sterilization of medical products, with reduced gamma rays dose rate. Its suitability for radiation vulcanization of locally produced natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> was confirmed experimentally. Obtained results showed that the peel off test device was acceptable for evaluation of natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> -filler interaction irrespective of the vulcanization system used with latex compound. Peel test results displayed the influence of modified fillers on the peel strength values of tested laminates. Increased peel strength values of the samples containing modified kaolin were attributed to better interaction of the filler with rubber polymer. It was investigated, that facilitated interaction observed with natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> and modified kaolin resulted in improved properties of filled natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> compounds of both vulcanization system, and irradiated one was more susceptible within the experiment performed. Preference in mechanical stability time, viscosity factor and tensile was given to radiation vulcanization natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> (RVNRL). Reinforcing effect of modified filers in natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> compounds was lower of that observed earlier with dry rubber compounds. The reason for it could be associated with partial deactivation of the active centres initially brought by modification the phenomenon that have to be studied and overcome in the future. However, it is hoped that carried out research positively contributes to the understanding the mechanism of reinforcement of rubber polymers with fillers and development of the technologies upgrading cheap local mineral resources to use them more beneficially in natural rubber formulation technology.
