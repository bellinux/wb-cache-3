40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "At federal offices of inspectors general (IG), criminal investigators can make warrantless arrests, obtain and execute search warrants, and carry firearms. Because IGs lack permanent statutory <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>authority,</b> most presidentially appointed IGs have to request temporary deputation from the Department of Justice (DOJ). However, presidentially appointed IGs at the U. S. Department of Agriculture, Department of Defense, and Department of the Treasury possess permanent statutory <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>authority</b> and {{do not need to}} obtain DOJ's approval. IG criminal investigators who are deputized do not differ in terms of their scope of <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>authority,</b> supervision, and training from their counterparts who have statutory <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>authority.</b> Deputized IGs receive additional oversight over their <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>authority.</b> Fifteen of the 23 deputized IGs report that statutory authority would improve their criminal investigative practices and enhance their recognition as fully authorized officers in the <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> community.
