50|$|A <b>loment</b> (or lomentum) {{is a type}} of {{indehiscent}} legume {{fruit that}} breaks apart at constrictions occurring between segments, so that each segment contains one seed. It {{is a type of}} schizocarp.|$|E
50|$|The blooms are {{produced}} in dense cylindrical spikes of numerous flowers, each individual flower with five cream colored 3 mm petals and numerous creamy yellow 6 mm stamens. The fruit is a flat, twisted legume (pod) 6 - 15 cm long, containing generally 3 to 5 hard, flattened, medium brown seeds. The seed pod is constricted between seeds (a <b>loment),</b> and seed dispersal occurs both through dehiscence and breaks at these constrictions.|$|E
50|$|Hedysareae is a {{tribe of}} {{plants in the}} {{subfamily}} Faboideae. Hedysareae species have <b>loments,</b> a type of modified legume that breaks apart at constrictions occurring between the segments of the seeds.|$|R
40|$|The {{monotypic}} genus Urariopsis, {{based on}} Uraria cordifolia Wall., {{has been compared}} with several S. E. Asiatic species of Uraria. The species Uraria prunellaefolia, U. collettii, and U. barbata {{are considered to be}} most closely related to U. cordifolia. The pods of U. cordifolia and U. collettii consist of longitudinally flattened, peltate <b>loments,</b> those of U. prunellaefolia consist of laterally flattened, longitudinally arranged loments; in the other species the <b>loments</b> are laterally flattened and zig-zag folded. No correlating characters were found, and the differences in shape of the pods are not considered sufficient ground to distinguish groups on generic level. Notes on morphology, nomenclature, and geographic distribution are presented...|$|R
50|$|Chaetocalyx is a genus of lianas in the legume family, Fabaceae. It {{belongs to}} the {{subfamily}} Faboideae, and was recently assigned to the informal monophyletic Adesmia clade of the Dalbergieae. Members of this genus are found in Central and South America. Chaetoealyx can be distinguished from most other legumes by its climbing habit, its imparipinnate leaves, and, in most species, by its elongate <b>loments.</b> It can be distinguished from Nissolia, which also has a climbing habit, by the articles of the <b>loments,</b> which are uniform in size in Chaetocalyx, rather than with a terminal, expanded, winglike article as in Nissolia. Unlike most papilionoid legumes, Chaetocalyx species do not form root nodules.|$|R
50|$|Isabel <b>Loment,</b> {{engaged to}} the {{ordinary}} and unexceptional Marshall Stokes, leads a peripatetic existence as the ward of her aunt, Ann Moor. Their travels {{take them to}} the downlands of Sussex, to Runhill Court, an ancient home owned by Henry Judge. There Isabel discovers a strange staircase few can see, which leads upwards to three doors. She chooses one, which opens onto a room that appears to exist only part of the time; what might lie behind the other doors remains a mystery. In the room she reencounters Judge. There they find new insights and are able to express themselves in new ways, but are unable to recall what has transpired there when they leave. They develop a disturbing parallel relationship in the mysterious room, which ultimately culminates in the death of Judge and the rupture of Isabel from Marshall.|$|E
40|$|Desmodium Desv. (Fabaceae) {{is perhaps}} the most {{difficult}} genus among Carolina legumes. Diagnostic recognition of the species has historically been based on mature <b>loment</b> and flower characters.

50|$|These {{are mostly}} {{inconspicuous}} legumes; few have bright or large flowers. Though some can become sizeable plants, most are herbs or small shrubs. Their fruit are <b>loments,</b> meaning each seed is dispersed individually enclosed in its segment. This makes them tenacious plants and some species are considered weeds in places. They {{have a variety}} of uses, as well.|$|R
2500|$|The ovary most {{typically}} develops into a legume. A legume is {{a simple}} dry fruit that usually dehisces (opens along a seam) on two sides. A common name {{for this type of}} fruit is a [...] "pod", although that can also be applied to a few other fruit types. A few species have evolved samarae, <b>loments,</b> follicles, indehiscent legumes, achenes, drupes, and berries from the basic legume fruit.|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this article is}} the evaluation of the contemporary land cover of areas exposed to floods. Two small towns in which flooding risk is high – Poddębice and Uniejów in lodzkie voivodeship, were chosen for detailed analysis. The area exposed to floods means an area that is probable to be covered by water once for a hundred years. The evaluation of the contemporary land cover was based on Topographic Database as well as local stocktaking, and supported by the use of GIS tools. The exposed areas aren't protected enough on the local level as far as planning instruments, especially local spatial development plans, are taken into consideration. As a result, the directives formulated by the heads of Regional Water Management Boards aren’t used in practice, because they restrict land development of the attractive areas and hamper <b>loment,</b> even despitecal economic develop the fact that those areas are endangered by floods...|$|E
40|$|Seedlings of Stylosanthes guianensis var. guianensis cv. Cook and S. guianensis var. pauciflora cv. Bandeirante were defoliated {{and placed}} in a {{naturally}} lit glasshouse at 23 / 18 °C, 28 / 23 °C or 33 / 28 °C (day/night). After exposure to 14 h days and after floral induction with 30 cycles of 11 h, plants were allocated to 11, 12, 13 or 14 h during flowering and seed formation. Floral initiation occurred after 10 - 15 short-day cycles. Flower appearance was hastened by warm temperatures and spike number per plant at 20 d after flower appearance was negatively related to temperature and greater in Cook than in Bandeirante. Exposure to 13 - and 14 -h days reduced the continued differentiation of inflorescences in Bandeirante, and in Cook in warm temperatures. Floret number per spike was greatest at 23 / 18 °C and a higher proportion of florets aborted in Bandeirante at 33 / 28 °C. Variations in seed setting of the bi-articulate <b>loment</b> of Bandeirante are described. Highest potential seed yield occurred if after floral induction 11 or 12 h days were maintained with 23 / 18 °C or 28 / 23 °C temperatures...|$|E
40|$|The genus Desmodium is {{represented}} in Santa Catarina State, Brazil, by 13 species, all with lomentaceous fruits. Shape, size and isthmus margin of loments vary, while the surface is glabrous, or covered by trichomes of different types. Morphological diversity of trichomes becomes particularly relevant to taxonomic description. The trichome types present {{on the surface of}} Desmodium fruits provide data for the identification and classification of species in the State. To assess this, three fruits of each species were collected and deposited at two herbaria, HBR and FLOR, in Santa Catarina, Brazil. Some rehydrated samples were examined using light microscopy (LM); and some sections were exposed to the following histochemical reagents: Sudan III for oils and Thionine for mucilage. The structural aspects of trichomes can be classified into uni- or multicel- lular and may still be simple, i. e., nonglandular or glandular. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), five types of trichomes were identified and analyzed among the Desmodium species studied: uncinate, uniseriate, globose multicellular, globose unicellular and subulate. Characteristics, such as <b>loment</b> margin and article form, glabrescent or pillous indument, trichome type, with or without papillous epidermal cells and epicuticular striations, showed relevant diagnostic value. An identification key was developed for Desmodium species from Santa Catarina State, Brazil, based on macro and micromorphological characters of the fruit...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe nearly {{cosmopolitan}} tribe Desmodieae (Fabaceae) {{includes many}} important genera for medicine and forage. However, the phylogenetic {{relationships among the}} infratribal groups circumscribed using morphological traits are still poorly known. In this study, we used chloroplast (rbcL, psbA-trnH) and nuclear (ITS- 1) DNA sequences to investigate the molecular phylogeny and historical biogeography of Desmodieae, and infer ancestral states for several vegetative and reproductive traits. Three groups, corresponding to the Desmodium, Lespedeza, and Phyllodium groups sensu Ohashi were retrieved in the phylogenetic analyses. Conflicts in the topologies inferred from the chloroplast and nuclear datasets were detected. For instance, the Lespedeza clade was sister to the groups Phyllodium + Desmodium based on chloroplast DNA, but nested within the Desmodium group based on ITS- 1. Moreover, the New Caledonian endemic genera Arthroclianthus and Nephrodesmus were not monophyletic but together formed a clade, which also included Hanslia and Ohwia based on chloroplast DNA. The hypothetical common ancestor of Desmodieae was dated to the Middle Oligocene (ca. 28. 3 Ma) and was likely an Asian shrub or tree producing indehiscent <b>loments.</b> Several colonization events towards Oceania, America, and Africa occurred (all less than ca. 17. 5 Ma), most probably through long distance dispersal. The fruits of Desmodieae repeatedly evolved from indehiscence to dehiscence. We also showed that indehiscent <b>loments</b> allow for more variability {{in the number of}} seeds per fruit than indehiscent legumes. Modularity seems here to allow variability in the number of ovules produced in a single ovary...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{efficient}} dispersal is one among other features that amplify the invasion potential of a plant. Knowledge of the ontogeny, morphology and fruit dispersal of species is indispensable for weed control in crops. To identify the pericarp structures involved in the fragmentation and dehiscence processes and other features related to dispersal, we studied the pericarp development of Aeschynomene evenia Wright, Desmodium incanum (Sw.) DC. and Vigna luteola (Jacq.) Benth. (Fabaceae-Faboideae), {{all of which are}} considered weeds in certain situations. For light and scanning electron microscopy studies, we fixed and processed buds, flowers and fruits, according to usual methods, at different stages of development. We observed that the sclerenchymatous endocarp is essential for dehiscence in legumes, as well as for fragmentation in <b>loments.</b> We also found that the presence of hook-shaped trichomes, sclereid nests in the mesocarp, septum, hypodermis and the formation of false septa are essential to the diaspore dispersal of the species studied...|$|R
50|$|Some dry dehiscent fruits form {{specialised}} capsule-like strucures. A follicle {{is derived}} from a single carpel that splits along a suture, as in Magnolia, while a legume splits along two sutures, and are {{a defining feature of}} the Fabaceae. Some variants of legumes that have retained vestigial sutures include <b>loments</b> that split transversly into segments, each with a single seed, and indehiscent legumes, such as Arachis hypogaea (peanuts). Capsules derived from two carpels include silicles and siliques that dehisce along two suture lines but retain a partition called the replum, which is a septum with attached seeds. While both are characteristic of Brassicaceae, silicles is at least as broad as it is long, and vice a versa. A schizocarp {{is derived from}} a compound ovary with two or more locules which then separate radially as one of the above types, such as a schizocarp of follicles, as in Asclepias (Asclepiadoideae) (see illustration).|$|R
