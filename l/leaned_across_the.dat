60|$|Penelope, who overheard, laughed {{softly and}} <b>leaned</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> table.|$|E
60|$|Brightman, who had {{scarcely}} spoken a word, <b>leaned</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> table.|$|E
60|$|Violet gave {{a little}} cry. She <b>leaned</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> table eagerly.|$|E
60|$|He <b>leans</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> table till {{his face}} was within {{a few inches of}} mine.|$|R
60|$|When he {{has gone}} Amy <b>leans</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> top of a chair, sobbing her little heart away. Alice tries to take her--the whole of her--in her arms, but is rebuffed with a shudder.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{that did}} it. Jerry rises, very slow, and <b>leans</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> table and clips the kid brother {{one side of}} the ear-'ole. And then there's a general imbroglio, {{everyone}} standing up and the kid hollering and the dog barking.|$|R
60|$|Helen <b>leaned</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> {{table and}} laid her hand upon her friend's.|$|E
60|$|Anne <b>leaned</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> {{table and}} took Marilla's {{face in her}} hands.|$|E
60|$|She <b>leaned</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> {{table and}} struck him heavily upon the cheek.|$|E
60|$|Gilbert Deyes <b>leaned</b> <b>across</b> to <b>the</b> {{side table}} and helped {{himself to a}} cigarette.|$|R
60|$|Herrick was at {{the wheel}} when he approached, and Huish <b>leaned</b> confidentially <b>across</b> <b>the</b> binnacle.|$|R
60|$|And next {{comes the}} boy, asking with a blush for love, and Nature's motherly old {{heart goes out}} to him, for it is an article she loves to sell, and she loves those who come to {{purchase}} it of her. So she <b>leans</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> counter, smiling, and tells him that she has the very thing he wants, and he, trembling with excitement, likewise asks the figure.|$|R
60|$|She obeyed at once. Selingman <b>leaned</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> table {{towards his}} companion.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Lecount <b>leaned</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> {{table and}} offered Noel Vanstone her hand.|$|E
60|$|Jim Shepherd <b>leaned</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> {{corner of}} the table and dropped his voice.|$|E
60|$|Hunterleys <b>leaned</b> {{suddenly}} forward <b>across</b> <b>the</b> {{little round}} table.|$|R
60|$|While we were talking, a girl--evidently no customer--had {{come into}} the shop, and the face and bearing of Mr. Shaynor changed. She <b>leaned</b> {{confidently}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> counter.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What? What?' They both <b>leaned</b> forward <b>across</b> <b>the</b> half-door. It {{could not}} have been {{properly}} fastened, for it opened, and tilted them out with hay and leaves sticking all over them.|$|R
60|$|She <b>leaned</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> table towards him, {{her chin}} {{supported}} by her clenched hands.|$|E
60|$|Dredlinton <b>leaned</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> desk. There was {{an almost}} satyrlike grin upon his face.|$|E
60|$|There was an instant's dead silence. Then Forrest, {{with white}} face, <b>leaned</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> table.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Foley's {{expression}} suddenly changed. He <b>leaned</b> {{a little}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> table.|$|R
40|$|Statue of William Marsh Rice {{being lifted}} from its {{pedestal}} by a crane, {{as it is}} returned to its original position. A worker <b>leans</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> pedestal, with his hands holding the statue by its base during the maneuver. Original resource is black and white photograph. Rice students pulled {{off one of the}} most famous Rice pranks by turning the statue of William Marsh Rice around to face Fondren Library on the morning of Tuesday April 12, 1988. Only one student was caught. Turning the statue back around afterwards proved to be a difficult task...|$|R
50|$|In {{woodworking}} {{the term}} circular saw is {{most commonly used}} to refer to a hand-held, electric circular saw designed for cutting wood, but may be used for cutting other materials with different blades. Circular saws can be either left or right-handed, depending {{on the side of the}} blade where the motor sits. A left-handed saw is typically easier to use if held in the right hand, and contrariwise for the right-handed saw, because the user does not need to <b>lean</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> saw to see the cutting line.|$|R
60|$|Sir Edward <b>leaned</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> table towards Mr. Coulson. Mr. Coulson {{had risen}} to his feet.|$|E
60|$|Van Teyl was discreetly silent. Fischer {{seemed to}} read his thoughts. He <b>leaned</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> table.|$|E
60|$|His manner {{acquired}} a new earnestness. He forgot his luncheon and <b>leaned</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> table towards her.|$|E
60|$|Doubtless {{it helped}} Mr. Ross in {{maintaining}} his sublimity {{to dress like}} a cleric--black, modest suits of straight lines, white shirts, small, black ties. But he also wore silk socks, which he reflectively scratched while he was dictating. He was of an elegance in linen handkerchiefs, in a chased-gold cigarette-case, in cigarettes with a monogram. Indeed, he often stopped during dictation to <b>lean</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> enormous mahogany desk and explain to Una {{how much of a}} connoisseur he was in tennis, fly-casting, the ordering of small, smart dinners at the Plaza.|$|R
6000|$|... "Those are the chairs, sir," [...] Burton admitted. Mr. Sherwell, with {{a gesture}} of contempt, {{replaced}} upon the floor the one which he had detached from its fellows. He <b>leaned</b> unsteadily <b>across</b> <b>the</b> table.|$|R
60|$|He <b>leaned</b> <b>across</b> to <b>the</b> {{little table}} which stood {{by his side}} and helped himself to brandy. He was indeed looking terribly ill. The lines under his eyes seemed traced with a coal-black pencil, and his hand shook so that half the brandy was spilled.|$|R
60|$|Johnson {{was deeply}} interested. He <b>leaned</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> table. His little black eyes were alight with cupidity.|$|E
60|$|Da Souza <b>leaned</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> table. His {{face was}} livid, and {{the corners of}} his eyes were bloodshot.|$|E
60|$|He drank {{his wine}} without {{apparent}} enjoyment, but he drank it like water. Selingman <b>leaned</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> table.|$|E
60|$|She {{ignored his}} gesture of invitation. She came on {{until she had}} reached the table before which he was seated. Then she <b>leaned</b> <b>across,</b> and <b>the</b> light of her eyes, the very insistence of her presence, seemed like things from which no escape was possible.|$|R
60|$|The uneasy {{beating of}} his foot {{suddenly}} stopped, and he <b>leaned</b> forward eagerly <b>across</b> <b>the</b> table.|$|R
5000|$|Anton sat up unusually {{straight}} and said loudly and clearly (although he knew almost no German): Ich sterbe ("I'm dying"). The doctor calmed him, took a syringe, {{gave him an}} injection of camphor, and ordered champagne. Anton took a full glass, examined it, smiled at me and said: [...] "It's {{a long time since}} I drank champagne." [...] He drained it and lay quietly on his left side, and I just had time to run to him and <b>lean</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> bed and call to him, but he had stopped breathing and was sleeping peacefully as a child ...|$|R
