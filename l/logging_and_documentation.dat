This paper presents Synoptic, a tool that helps developers by inferring a concise and accurate system model. Unlike most related work, Synoptic does not require developer-written scenarios, specifications, negative execution examples, or other complex user input. Synoptic processes the logs most systems already produce and requires developers only to specify a set of regular expressions for parsing the logs. Synoptic has two unique features. First, the model it produces satisfies three kinds of temporal invariants mined from the logs, improving accuracy over related approaches. Second, Synoptic uses refinement and coarsening to explore the space of models. This improves model efficiency and precision, compared to using just one approach. In this paper, we formally prove that Synoptic always produces a model that satisfies exactly the temporal invariants mined from the <b>log,</b> <b>and</b> we argue that it does so efficiently. We empirically evaluate Synoptic through two user experience studies, one with a developer of a large, real-world system and another with 45 students in a distributed systems course. Developers used Synoptic-generated models to verify known bugs, diagnose new bugs, and increase their confidence in the correctness of their systems. None of the developers in our evaluation had a background in formal methods but were able to easily use Synoptic and detect implementation bugs in as little as a few minutes...|$|R

40|$|Rural {{communities}} face {{many factors}} that may contribute to an obesogenic environment which include poorer food options (highly processed, low cost, and energy ­dense), reduced physical activity opportunities and resources, increased reliance on automobiles, and social aspects such isolation and neighborhood safety. Sub-optimal school contexts hinder students' healthy eating and physical activity before, during and after school. Active school transit is difficult for children in rural communities because of spatial distance to students' homes. Rural communities often have insufficient outdoor and indoor spaces for active recreation. Access, availability and affordability of nutrient ­dense foods such as fruits and vegetables are limited in rural environments. The overarching goal of Generating Rural Options for Weight Healthy Kids and Communities (GROW­ HKC) is to prevent childhood obesity. The 5 -year study included selected rural communities within Oregon and five participating Western states (AZ, CO, NM, NV, and WA). One specific aim {{of the project was}} to plan, implement and evaluate a multi-level intervention targeting rural home, school, and community contexts to improve eating habits, increase physical activity and improve BMI trends in elementary school-age children. To do so, Extension personnel were trained to support weight healthy community development, participatory action research tools were created and used to assess community resources and readiness, and guide community-driven, environmentally ­based obesity prevention strategies. A process evaluation was implemented to better understand the relationship between Extension intervention efforts and changes to the obesogenic environment. Qualitative data sources, including personnel daily effort <b>and</b> activity <b>logs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>documentation</b> of changes in school and community resources were imported, coded, and analyzed using QSR NVivo 10 to describe community capacity building strategies and activities the GROW staff implemented in the Clackamas County intervention.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{end-user}} support, and {{the tools that}} are {{necessary in order to}} take full advantage of information from end-users. Information from end-users can be exploited to improve the support organisation, the systems <b>and</b> <b>documentation</b> used by end-users ad so on. In most workplaces the ability to use information technology efficiently is important, and efficient support is considered to be a critical factor of success. Because information technology is developing continuously, good support is needed in order to give employees the best working conditions possible. The most important job for an information center is to give efficient and high quality service to the end-users. In order to be efficient, good tools are necessary and with the right tools support can be proactive as well as reactive. The most important tools in end-user support are the service desk, tools for contacting support such as telephone and web-based interaction, a tool for <b>logging</b> incidents <b>and</b> <b>documentation.</b> The case study in the thesis is the Norwegian taxation authorities support organisation, and what tools they use in order to utilize information from end-users. The taxation authorities manage three large systems; the national register system, the taxation system and the value added tax system. End-user support is divided into two major areas; technical support and expertise support in the area of the assessment profession. The IT-department is responsible for the technical support and the managers of the systems are responsible for the expertise support. The findings of the study show that there are several areas in which the taxation authorities can take better advantage of information from end-users. One area is a more systematic development of a solutions database. The solutions database can be used not only by support staff in the information centre but also by local support staff. An important tool for improving support is customer surveys. Customer satisfaction are important and the only way to find out how the users feel about the support they’re receiving is to ask them. Customer surveys are not currently used in order to get information about the customers’ satisfaction with, and expectations towards the support centre. Another source of information from end-users that are not currently in use, are <b>logging</b> of problems <b>and</b> questions that are solved by local support staff. Performing customer surveys <b>and</b> <b>logging</b> of incidents that are handled by local staff can give the support center important information. Better utilization of information from end-users will result in better and more efficient support, and in the end increased productivity. The thesis concludes that a transformation of the support organisation is necessary if information from end-users is to be fully utilized. The result of a transformation will be better utilization of tools and information from end-users. The three main results of a transformation should be: A stronger support organisation, introduction of uniform routines and processes to support the technology in use, and the initiation of a Knowledge Management project in the support organisation...|$|R

40|$|Several {{methods are}} {{employed}} by the timber industry to try to restrict the flow of products from illegal or unsustainable sources into timber supply chains. The most commonly applied are systems of <b>log</b> marking <b>and</b> associated <b>documentation</b> that accompany the logs. However this system is open to falsification, particularly between the <b>logging</b> concession <b>and</b> the timber mill, {{where the majority of}} illegally logged timber enters the supply chain. This paper describes the development of a methodology to track a unique genetic fingerprint for single logs of merbau, Intsia palembanica (Leguminosae), a high-value Indonesian timber species, from logging concession to the mill, where the DNA profile of individual logs is difficult or impossible to falsify. We find that whilst the ability to extract DNA and amplify a PCR product from logs decreases slightly between forest concession (59. 2 %) and mill (41. 9 %) samples, that overall enough samples worked across the 14 microsatellite markers to provide an exact genotype match between forest and sawmill samples for 27 out of 32 logs. Furthermore for these 27 samples, the probability that an illegal log with an exact genotype match to forest samples had been substituted was very low (less than 10 – 5) for 18 samples, was low (between 10 – 2 and 10 – 4) for 7 samples and was moderate (10 – 1) for 2 samples. Improvements to DNA extraction and amplification success are recommended to improve this protocol, and there was a negative correlation between locus size and amplification success but a positive correlation with allele number. However, overall we propose that this methodology is now suitable for broad-scale industry application to track legally harvested timber and check for illegal substitutions along supply chains. A. J.
