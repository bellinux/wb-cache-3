40|$|Graduation date: 1988 The {{purpose was}} to gain {{information}} about the determinants of student behavior with respect to laboratory (<b>lab)</b> <b>and</b> non-laboratory (non-lab) science learning activities. Fishbein and Ajzen's (1975) theory of reasoned action was used to investigate students' salient beliefs, correlations between determinants of intention, and the relative weights of determinants of intention. Analogous correlations for the <b>lab</b> <b>and</b> non-lab were compared, and gender and grade level were tested for effects upon the determinants of intention. Multistage cluster sampling was used to select 377 grades 3 to 8 public school students in 18 classes in 3 Oregon school districts. Salient beliefs were elicited from 72 of these students. Cores of salient beliefs related to attitude toward <b>lab</b> <b>and</b> non-lab behaviors and cores of salient beliefs related to subjective norm (significant others) for <b>lab</b> <b>and</b> non-lab behaviors were identified. These beliefs were used to construct two instruments (<b>lab</b> <b>and</b> non-lab). A pilot study was conducted involving 102 other students. Finally, half of the original 377 sample responded to the <b>lab</b> instrument <b>and</b> half to the non-lab instrument. Multiple regression showed that attitude toward behavior and subjective norm explained significant (p̲. 10). Attitude toward behavior had a greater relative weight than subjective norm for both <b>lab</b> <b>and</b> non-lab. The correlations between adjacent constructs {{in the theory of}} reasoned action were significant (p̲ <. 08) for both <b>lab</b> <b>and</b> non-lab. Some significant differences between analogous <b>lab</b> <b>and</b> non-lab correlations were found. ANOVA revealed that gender had a significant effect on precursors of attitude toward behavior and subjective norm in one of four cases; it was of low practical significance. ANOVA showed that grade level had a significant effect on precursors of attitude toward behavior and subjective norm for both <b>lab</b> <b>and</b> non-lab behavioral intentions. The data with the theory showed that, in general, the intention to engage in <b>lab</b> <b>and</b> nonlab activities would be lowest for those in grade 8. A subjective analysis revealed that both gender and grade level affected the relative weights of attitude toward behavior and subjective norm for <b>lab</b> <b>and</b> non-lab. A psychological theory of social behavior was used to gain baseline information relevant to the intentions of science learners. This information might be used to plan strategies for affecting science student behavior so that they will become more scientifically literate...|$|R

5|$|The main Scarborough School building, Vanderlip Hall, was {{designed}} by William W. Bosworth, known for landscaping Kykuit and restoring Versailles. The school building was constructed in a severe, all-white Neoclassical style, and was completed early in 1917. In addition to a grand porticoed entry, there were two wings that housed classes, a library, cafeteria and gymnasium, basement science <b>labs,</b> <b>and</b> an art room measuring , ringed on three sides with French windows. In the 1960s, an additional Modernist structure was built across a stream that would ultimately house the school's lower grades.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, Bell Labs {{formulated}} {{their own}} set of requirements for radar work in relation to Nike-X.

Additionally, a Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star aircraft was refit with optical and infrared telescopes for optical tracking tests. The first series of tests, RMP-A, focused on modern conical reentry vehicles. It concluded on 30 June 1966. These demonstrated that these vehicles were difficult to discriminate because of their low drag. RMP-B ran between 1967 and 1970, supported by 17 launches from Vandenberg, {{with a wide variety of}} vehicle shapes and penetration aids.|$|E

5|$|Some {{mainframe}} {{games that}} did not appear in 101 BASIC Computer Games have still had a lasting impact. One such game was Space Travel, developed by Ken Thompson in 1969, which simulates travel in the Solar System. The player flies their ship around a two-dimensional scale model {{of the solar system}} with no objectives other than to attempt to land on various planets and moons. The player can move and turn the ship, and adjust the overall speed by adjusting the scale of the simulation. The ship is affected by the single strongest gravitational pull of the astronomical bodies. The game was developed at Bell <b>Labs,</b> <b>and</b> was ported during 1969 from the Multics operating system to the GECOS operating system on the GE 635 computer, and then to the PDP-7 minicomputer. While porting the game to the PDP-7, Thompson developed ideas for his own operating system, which later formed the core of the Unix operating system. Space Travel never spread beyond Bell Labs or had an effect on future games, leaving its primary legacy as part of the original push for the development of Unix.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Patients {{undergoing}} pancreas resection carry several {{risk factors}} for nosocomial bacterial infections. Synbiotics are potentially useful for prevention of these infections. First trails in patients following major abdominal surgery including liver transplantation using one Lactobacillus (<b>LAB)</b> <b>and</b> one fiber showed significant reduction of infection rates and reduced length of antibiotic therapy compared to a control group. The present {{study was designed to}} analyse if a combination of different <b>LAB</b> <b>and</b> fibers would further improve outcome. A prospective randomized double-blind trail was undertaken in 80 patients following pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PPPD). All patients received enteral nutrition immediately postoperatively. One group (A) received a composition of four <b>LAB</b> <b>and</b> four fibers and another group (B) received the fibers only starting the day before surgery and continuing for eight days. 30 -day infection rate, length of hospital stay, duration of antibiotic therapy, non-infectious complications and side effects of enteral nutrition were recorded. The incidence of postoperative bacterial infections was significantly lower with <b>LAB</b> <b>and</b> fibers (12, 5 %) than with only fibers (40 %). In addition, the duration of antibiotic therapy was significantly shorter in the <b>LAB</b> group. Fibers <b>and</b> <b>LAB</b> were well tolerated.
