Ruth MacDonald saw Geisel's drawing style as fully formed in Mulberry Street, arguing that only his page design improved in later books, better keeping children's attention without confusing them. Philip Nel found the artwork in Geisel's later books {{to have a greater}} energy and <b>looseness</b> than in Mulberry Street or his earlier cartooning. Nel felt Geisel began loosening up toward his classic style as early as Horton Hatches the Egg (1940) and reached fruition with 1950's If I Ran the Zoo (1950).|$|E

25|$|Even with Naresuan's reforms, the {{effectiveness}} of the royal government over the next 150 years was unstable. Royal power outside the crown lands-—although in theory absolute—was in practice limited by the <b>looseness</b> of the civil administration. The influence of central government and the king was not extensive beyond the capital. When war with the Burmese broke out in late eighteenth century, provinces easily abandoned the capital. As the enforcing troops were not easily rallied to defend the capital, the city of Ayutthaya could not stand against the Burmese aggressors.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of a woman’s life, her breasts change in size and volume as the skin {{envelope}} becomes inelastic, and the Cooper’s suspensory ligaments—which suspend the mammary gland high against the chest—become loose, and so cause the falling forward and the sagging of the breast and the nipple-areola complex (NAC). Moreover, additional to tissue prolapse, postpartum diminishment (involution) of the voluminous milk glands in the breast aggravates the <b>looseness</b> of the suspensory ligaments, and of the inelastic, overstretched skin envelope. Mastopexy corrects said degenerative physical changes, by elevating the (internal) parenchymal tissues, cutting and re-sizing the skin envelope, and transposing the nipple-areola complex higher upon the breast hemisphere. The degree of breast ptosis of each breast is determined by the position of the nipple-areola complex (NAC) upon the breast hemisphere; ptosis of the breast is measured with the modified Regnault ptosis grade scale.|$|E
25|$|The Colt Python {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 1955 as Colt's top-of-the-line model and was originally {{intended to be a}} large-frame 38 Special target revolver. As a result, it features precision adjustable sights, a smooth trigger, solid construction, and extra metal. Pythons have a distinct appearance due to a full barrel underlug, ventilated rib and adjustable sights. Colt originally manufactured Pythons with hollow underlugs but left them solid to work as a stabilizing barrel weight. When the revolver is at full cock, just as the trigger is pressed, the cylinder locks up {{for the duration of the}} hammer strike. Other revolvers have a hint of <b>looseness</b> even at full-cock. The gap between the cylinder and forcing cone is very tight, further aiding accuracy and velocity. From the 1970s each Python revolver was boresighted at the factory with a laser; the first mass-produced revolver for which this was done.|$|E

[...] H. H. Arnason noted that Whaam! presents [...] "limited, flat colors and hard, precise drawing," [...] which produce [...] "a hard-edge subject painting that documents while it gently parodies the familiar hero images of modern America." [...] The flat and highly finished style of planned brushstrokes can be seen as pop art's reaction against the <b>looseness</b> of abstract expressionism. Alastair Sooke says that the work can be interpreted as a symbolic self-portrait in which the pilot in the left panel represents Lichtenstein [...] "vanquishing his competitors in a dramatic art-world dogfight" [...] by firing a missile at the colorful [...] "parody of abstract painting" [...] in the right panel.|$|E

Soon after he took effective command, the 6th Maryland Regiment became known as the equal, if not superior, to any in the whole army.|$|E
500|$|The {{songs on}} Rhythm Killers are typified by deep bass, {{striking}} beats, low-frequency grooves, improvisational rhythms, electronic percussion, disco-era string synthesizers, aggressive guitar riffs, and stylistic influences from reggae, early hip hop, downtown music, hard rock, and worldbeat genres. They are densely layered {{in a fashion}} similar to Phil Spector's Wall of Sound production. Bud Kliment of Trouser Press said they comprise a groove-oriented [...] "song cycle" [...] that is [...] "heavy-bottomed from start to finish". Similar to the album's funk instrumentation, the guest rappers have exclamatory, confrontational tones and percussive vocals. The vocals are complemented by improvisatory turntable scratches and both African- and Latin-influenced percussion, which resulted in cross-rhythms during the songs. Carl Matthews of the Baltimore Afro-American observed [...] "a noticeable <b>looseness</b> in the vocals and a sort of P-Funk quality to the rhythm tracks." [...] Mat Smith from Melody Maker said the enthusiastic music was driven by a [...] "schizophrenic art of noise attack all lashed around a nonstop rhythm that bumps each track nose to tail tight." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{critical}} {{reviews of}} the work came from scientists who objected to Bakker's <b>looseness</b> with scientific fact. The paleontologist Thomas Holtz noted that Bakker combined fauna in ways not directly supported by the fossil record; for example, several of the dinosaurs featured in the books lived millions of years after Utahraptor died out. Michael Taylor, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the National Museums of Scotland, panned the book, saying that [...] "Raptor Red is an accurate portrayal only {{within the context of}} uncertainties over the reconstruction of fossil animals as living forms ... Bakker's postscript never really admits these uncertainties." [...] David B. Norman criticized the book as [...] "no more than a children's adventure story—and a rather poorly written one at that ... The merging of science and fantasy is at its worst in books like Raptor Red because none but the experts can disentangle fact from fiction; this type of nonsense turns an uninformed reader into a misinformed one." [...] Jay Ingram, from the Discovery Channel, published a rebuttal, saying, [...] "The most important point is that Bakker's portrayal of the dinosaurs in Raptor Red is vivid—vivid in a way few museum displays or factual accounts can be. And if it turns out in the long run that some of the speculation is unwarranted, who cares? Bob Bakker has given us a unique window onto the era of dinosaurs." ...|$|E
500|$|GameSpot Greg Kasavin spoke {{highly of}} the tight {{controls}} and accessible gameplay {{in spite of}} a larger learning curve. IGN's Goldstein described the controls as [...] "relatively simple" [...] and easy to understand within a single game, and Scott Osborne of GameSpy found the controls awkward but easily learned. In comparison, Charles Herold of The New York Times and a friend could not figure out Blitz's rules for 20 minutes, feeling [...] "too macho" [...] to do the tutorial. Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Jonathan Silver thought the gameplay was too frenzied, like [...] "NHL Hitz on steroids". Hilary Goldstein of IGN's only complaint about the controls was the camera's <b>looseness.</b> She noted the game's [...] "serious attitude" [...] and [...] "very gritty view of sports", and similar to hockey, felt that the non-disc action was [...] "one of the nicest aspects" [...] of the game. She praised the graphics and environments, surround sound, the array of unlockables, the single-player, and its replay value, but bemoaned the lack of options to change between camera views, the Action view in general, and the indistinguishability between players. Goldstein regarded Deathrows profanity as the [...] "best use of endless cursing in a game... ever". Herold of The New York Times noted violence's centrality to the game and figured that the game's age restrictions were likely due to the [...] "savage profanities", which he felt gave the game personality unlike other sports video games. He added that the game's frantic speed kept him too consumed to curse at the game himself. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Troy Oxford also connected the profanity to the game's [...] "'M' rating".|$|E
500|$|History {{remembers the}} Army of the Tennessee {{as one of}} the most {{important}} Union armies during the Civil War, an army intimately associated with the Union's two most celebrated generals, Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman. [...] It is thus rather ironic that frequent military reorganizations and <b>looseness</b> of usage during the war itself make it difficult to pinpoint the exact date at which this army formally came into existence. It should suffice to note that the [...] "nucleus [...] around which was to gather the... Army of the Tennessee" [...] first took shape in 1861–1862, while Grant was headquartered at Cairo, Illinois. Those troops continued under Grant in his next command, the distinct District of West Tennessee; they were then sometimes, and perhaps most appropriately, called the [...] "Army of West Tennessee." [...] However, army correspondence began using the term [...] "Army of the Tennessee" [...] in March 1862; that term soon became commonplace and naturally lived on when Grant's command was elevated to departmental status in October 1862, as the Department of the Tennessee. [...] During the course of the war, elements of the Army of the Tennessee performed many tasks, and the army evolved with the addition and subtraction of many units. It is not feasible to chronicle every such development here, even at the corps level. Rather, this article traces the main thrust of the army's development and its most memorable activities. At any given time, substantial numbers of troops were engaged in activities not discussed here. For example, in April 1863, less than half of Grant's departmental strength was directly engaged in the Vicksburg Campaign.|$|E

Today’s decision is SCRAP for a new generation." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Nathalia Wright's view, Melville's {{sentences}} {{generally have}} a <b>looseness</b> of structure, {{easy to use}} for devices as catalogue and allusion, parallel and refrain, proverb and allegory. The length of his clauses may vary greatly, but the [...] "torterous" [...] writing in Pierre and The Confidence-Man is there to convey feeling, not thought. Unlike Henry James, who was an innovator of sentence ordering to render the subtlest nuances in thought, Melville made few such innovations. His domain is the mainstream of English prose, with its rhythm and simplicity influenced by the King James Bible.|$|E

Lucilius was a rugged patriot and a {{significant}} voice in Roman self-awareness, endearing himself to his countrymen by his blunt frankness and explicit politics. His work expressed genuine freedom or libertas. His style included [...] 'metrical vandalism' [...] and <b>looseness</b> of structure. Horace instead adopted an oblique and ironic style of satire, ridiculing stock characters and anonymous targets. His libertas was the private freedom of a philosophical outlook, not a political or social privilege.

2500|$|By 1900, Sargent was at {{the height}} of his fame. Cartoonist Max Beerbohm {{completed}} one of his seventeen caricatures of Sargent, making well-known to the public the artist's paunchy physique. Although only in his forties, Sargent began to travel more and to devote relatively less time to portrait painting. His An Interior in Venice (1900), a portrait of four members of the Curtis family in their elegant palatial home, Palazzo Barbaro, was a resounding success. But, Whistler did not approve of the <b>looseness</b> of Sargent's brushwork, which he summed up as [...] "smudge everywhere." [...] One of Sargent's last major portraits in his bravura style was that of Lord Ribblesdale, in 1902, finely attired in an elegant hunting uniform. Between 1900 and 1907, Sargent continued his high productivity, which included, in addition to dozens of oil portraits, hundreds of portrait drawings at about $400 each.|$|E
2500|$|Scrying {{is neither}} a single, clearly-defined, nor formal {{discipline}} {{and there is no}} uniformity in the procedures, which repeatedly and independently have been reinvented or elaborated in many ages and regions. Furthermore, practitioners and authors coin terminology so arbitrarily, and often artificially, that no one system of nomenclature can be taken as authoritative and definitive. Commonly terms in use are Latinisations or [...] of descriptions of the media or activities. Examples of names coined for crystal gazing include crystallomancy, spheromancy, and catoptromancy. As an example of the <b>looseness</b> of such terms, catoptromancy should refer more specifically to scrying by use of mirrors or other reflective objects rather than by crystal gazing. Other names that have been coined for the use of various scrying media include anthracomancy for glowing coals, turifumy for scrying into smoke, and hydromancy for scrying into water. There is no clear limit to the coining and application of such terms and media.|$|E
2500|$|Each extant {{panel is}} {{dominated}} by a single horizontal line in which Christ is centrally positioned. Examination of the underdrawings show that the artist frequently deviated from his preliminary sketches, {{an indication of the}} <b>looseness</b> and freshness of his overall approach. The images are flat as they are completed before the advent of perspective. They are the more remarkable for the rich and precisely rendered small details, and use of glazes, given that they were completed before the development of oil painting some 30 years later. According to art historian Robert Suckale, [...] "never before have weapons appeared sharper or shields more spiked." [...] The painting is quintessentially Gothic and does not evidence any Italian influence. Rather it can be within the tradition of Bohemian painting, or possibly Franco-Flemish art. Its innovative use of light may be traced to the techniques of the Master Theoderic, while the positioning of the knight below Christ in the Resurrection references the Christ child in the c 1350 Italian-Byzantium icon, the Eichhorn Madonna.|$|E
2500|$|Wesley's {{attitude}} toward Dryden deserves a moment's pause. In the [...] "Essay on Heroic Poetry" [...] {{he observed that}} a speech of Satan's in Paradise Lost is nearly equalled in Dryden's State of Innocence. Later in the same essay he credited a passage in Dryden's King Arthur with showing an improvement upon Tasso. There is no doubt as to his vast respect for the greatest living poet, but his remarks do not indicate that he ranked Dryden with Virgil, Tasso, or Milton; for he recognized {{as well as we}} that the power to embellish and to imitate successfully does not constitute the highest excellence in poetry. In the Epistle to a Friend he affirmed his admiration for Dryden's matchless style, his harmony, his lofty strains, his youthful fire, and even his wit—in the main, qualities of style and expression. But by 1700 Wesley had absorbed enough of the new puritanism that was rising in England to qualify his praise; now he deprecated the <b>looseness</b> and indecency of the poetry, and called upon the poet to repent. One other point calls for comment. Wesley's scheme for Christian machinery in the epic, as [...] described in the [...] "Essay on Heroic Poetry", is remarkably similar to Dryden's. Dryden's had appeared in the essay on satire prefaced to his translation of Juvenal, published late in October 1692; Wesley's scheme appeared soon after June 1693.|$|E
2500|$|Physician–patient {{privilege}} {{is usually}} statutorily defined, and {{can vary from}} state to state. [...] The usual rule is that medical records are immune from subpoena if the plaintiff has not alleged physical or mental injuries or damages.

[...] While witnesses may try to resist legal discovery [...] by asking the judge to protect them from questioning or inspection of documents, the policy of the courts is in favor of full disclosure. It is the intent of the rules of procedure that pre-trial discovery take place without any intervention of a judge. So-called [...] "fishing expeditions" [...] (massive and aimless calls for all documents related to the litigation) are permissible under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 (b) (1). This rule is repeated in many states' rules of procedure: [...] "Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant ... if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence." [...] The <b>looseness</b> of the definition of relevant evidence is generally construed to mean [...] "liberal" [...] production. The physician who is the party to an action does not own the records of patients he has treated. They are not privileged if the patient has waived confidentiality.

2500|$|Some {{light is}} shed on the {{literary}} tastes of his period by Epistle {{to a friend}} concerning poetry (1700) and the Essay on Heroic Poetry (1697), which {{with a few exceptions}} were in accord with the prevailing current. The Life of Our Blessed Lord shows strongly the influence of Cowley's Davideis. Wesley's great admiration persisted after the tide had turned away from Cowley; and his liking for the [...] "divine Herbert" [...] and for Crashaw represented the tastes of sober and unfashionable readers. Although he professed unbounded admiration for Homer as the greatest genius in nature, in practise he seemed more inclined to follow the lead of Cowley, Virgil, and Vida. Although there was much in Ariosto that he enjoyed, he preferred Tasso; the irregularities in both, however, he felt bound to deplore. To Spenser's Faerie Queene he allowed extraordinary merit. If the plan of it was noble, he thought, and the mark of a comprehensive genius, yet the action of the poem seemed confused. Nevertheless, like Prior later, Wesley was inclined to suspend judgment on this point because the poem had been left incomplete. To Spenser's [...] "thoughts" [...] he paid the highest tribute, and to his [...] "Expressions flowing natural and easie, with such a prodigious Poetical Copia as never any other must expect to enjoy." [...] Like most of the Augustans Wesley did not care greatly for Paradise Regained, but he partly atoned by his praise for Paradise Lost, which was an [...] "original" [...] and therefore [...] "above the common Rules." [...] Though defective in its action, it was resplendent with sublime thoughts perhaps superior to any in Virgil or Homer, and full of incomparable and exquisitely moving passages. In spite of his belief that Milton's blank verse was a mistake, making for <b>looseness</b> and incorrectness, he borrowed lines and images from it, and in Bk.
