50|$|Brass is {{used for}} {{decoration}} for its bright gold-like appearance; for applications where low friction is required such as <b>locks,</b> gears, <b>bearings,</b> doorknobs, ammunition casings and valves; for plumbing and electrical applications; and extensively in brass musical instruments such as horns and bells where a combination of high workability (historically with hand tools) and durability is desired. It is also used in zippers. Brass is often used in situations {{in which it is}} important that sparks are not struck, such as in fittings and tools used near flammable or explosive materials.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device for interventions in a tube-shaped body cavity, in particular for ureteroendotomy. The device has a guide tube (3) containing an axially movable operating rod (4) at whose proximal end is a knife (1) with {{a cutting edge}} (8) and at whose other end an operating end to move the knife (1) in the axial direction from an idle position to an operating position. The main feature of the invention is that a knife guiding part (2) is provided, said part being connected to the guide tube (3) in a <b>locked</b> <b>bearing</b> and which is provided with an axial bore hole to receive and guide a knife holding sleeve (5) bearing the knife (1) and coupled to the operating rod (4) and an axial slot forming two guide jaws (12) for the knife (1), whereby the guiding jaws (12) of the knife guiding parts (2) has a shape largely fitting {{the shape of the}} knife (1) such that the cutting edge (8) of the knife (1) is covered completely by the guiding jaws (12) on the side when the cutting edg e (8) of the knife (1) is in its idle position, and that, furthermore, the knife guiding part (2) has a thicker part (14) clamping the body cavity perpendicular to the plane of the cutting edge (8) in the front area already freeing the cutting edge (8) of the knife (1) on its top side on transition to an operating position...|$|R
50|$|Initial {{problems}} with this lug cracking drove further development of the M1922 resulting in the final M2 version. the main distinguishing change in the M2 variant was the incorporation of an adjustable headspace mechanism in the locking lug. This mechanism consisted of an Allen key screw that passed through the <b>locking</b> lug <b>bearing</b> against the right rear receiver wall. This headspace screw was locked in place, after adjustment, by a brass pin that bore against headspace screws' threads. the brass pin was not threaded but {{held in place by}} a lead plug. The lead plug shows a small eagle that was pressed into the plug by the special tool used by the armourer. If the eagle was disturbed the armourer would know that an attempt had been made to change the headspace by unauthorised personnel.|$|R

40|$|Total syntheses of sterically locked phycocyanobilin {{derivatives}} with a 15 Z-anti or a 15 E-anti CD-ring component {{were performed}} toward elucidation of the stereochemistry {{and function of}} the chromophore in phytochromes. In {{the course of the}} construction of a sterically locked 15 E-anti CD-ring component employing 5 -tosylpyrrolin- 2 -one derivatives as the D-ring, the Ts group was found to be rearranged under acidic conditions to give a mixture of regioisomers, both of which could be transformed into the same CD-ring precursor via detosylation with a base followed by Wittig-like coupling reaction. In addition, a sterically locked 15 E-anti biliverdin derivative was also synthesized.

40|$|Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is a {{translational}} recoding mechanism {{commonly used}} by RNA viruses to express {{two or more}} proteins from a single mRNA at a fixed ratio. An essential element in this process {{is the presence of}} an RNA secondary structure, such as a pseudoknot or a hairpin, located downstream of the slippery sequence. Here, we have tested the efficiency of RNA oligonucleotides annealing downstream of the slippery sequence to induce frameshifting in vitro. Maximal frameshifting was observed with oligonucleotides of 12 – 18 [*]nt. Antisense oligonucleotides <b>bearing</b> <b>locked</b> nucleid acid (LNA) modifications also proved to be efficient frameshift-stimulators in contrast to DNA oligonucleotides. The number, sequence and location of LNA bases in an otherwise DNA oligonucleotide have to be carefully manipulated to obtain optimal levels of frameshifting. Our data favor a model in which RNA stability at the entrance of the ribosomal tunnel is the major determinant of stimulating slippage rather than a specific three-dimensional structure of the stimulating RNA element...|$|R
40|$|TNO, {{together}} with its partners Micromega and SRON, have designed a cryogenic scanning mechanism {{for use in}} the SAFARI Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) on board of the SPICA mission. The optics of the FTS scanning mechanism (FTSM) consists of two back-to-back cat's-eyes. The optics are mounted on a central "back-bone" tube which houses all the important mechatronic parts: the magnetic bearing linear guiding system, a magnetic linear motor serving as the OPD actuator, internal metrology with nanometer resolution, and a launch <b>lock.</b> A magnetic <b>bearing</b> is employed to enable a large scanning stroke in a small volume. It supports the optics in a freefloating way with no friction, or other non-linearities, enabling sub-nanometer accuracy within a single stage with a stroke of - 4 mm to + 31. 5 mm. Because the FTSM will be used at cryogenic temperatures of 4 Kelvin, the main structure and optics are all constructed from 6061 Aluminum. The overall outside dimensions of the FTSM are: 393 × 130 × 125 mm, and the mass is 2. 2 kg. © 2010 SPIE...|$|R
40|$|Tests are {{performed}} on a flexure-pivot-pad tilting-pad bearing {{with a series}} integral squeeze film damper in load-between-pads configuration, with both active and locked damper. The damper effects are negated when locked, resulting in a flexure-pivot-pad bearing only. Experimental tests provide static performance data and dynamic stiffnesses from which rotordynamic coefficients are extracted. The following two excitation schemes are implemented: (1) multi-frequency, single direction excitation and (2) single-frequency, rotating load excitation (or "circular excitation"). The XLTRC 2 Rotordynamics Software Suite provides stiffness and damping coefficient, eccentricity, and power loss predictions for the <b>locked</b> damper <b>bearing.</b> Test conditions include the rotor-speed range of 4000 - 12000 rpm and the unit-load range of 0 - 862 kPa (0 - 125 psi). Dynamic tests utilizing the multi-frequency excitation for the locked and active damper bearing configurations both show that the real portion of the dynamic stiffness is well modeled by a quadratic curve fit, and the imaginary portion representing the damping is a linear function of excitation frequency. This means that frequency independent coefficients can be obtained when an added mass term is included. While stiffness coefficients are lower for the active damper bearing, damping coefficients remain almost constant between the locked and active damper configurations. A simulation shows that, although the damping coefficients do not change significantly, the reduced stiffness provided by the damper results in greater effective damping. Static performance tests for the locked and active damper bearing indicate low cross-coupling, {{as shown by the}} eccentricity and low attitude angle measurements. Pad metal temperature measurements show a smaller temperature differential along the pad arcs for the active damper bearing, than observed for the locked damper case. Frictional power loss is estimated based on lubricant temperature rise and does not differ significantly for the two bearing configurations...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the sport}} of biathlon, because semiautomatic guns are illegal for race use, straight-pull actions are quite common, and are used almost {{exclusively}} on the world cup along with the Lateral Toggle action. The first company to make the straight pull action for [...]22 caliber was J. G. Anschütz; the action is specifically the straight pull ball <b>bearing</b> <b>lock</b> action, which features spring-loaded ball bearings {{on the side of}} the bolt which lock into a groove inside the bolt's housing. With the new design came a new dry-fire method; instead of the bolt being turned up slightly, the action is locked back to catch the firing pin. The two companies who have made the lateral toggle are Finn biathlon, as well as Izhmash. Finn was the first to make this type of action, however, due to the large swing of the arm as well as the stiffness of the bolt, these rifles fell out of favour and have been discontinued. Izhmash improved on the lateral swing with their Biathlon 7-3 and 7-4 series rifles, which have some use on world cups, but are largely thought of as inaccurate as well as having the inconvenience of having to remove the shooter's hand from the grip.|$|R
40|$|Implementing a {{predictive}} maintenance model {{does not have}} to be a five year, million dollar project. There are relatively simple steps a maintenance team can take to see results within the first year. Because overall cost of {{predictive maintenance}} is up to four time less expensive than preventative maintenance, as many assets as possible should be covered by predictive maintenance. Facilitating the transition to predictive maintenance is made easier with a Computerized Maintenance Management System. A good CMMS is user-friendly, automatically produces preventative maintenance work orders, and tracks all work done on each piece of machinery. IR scans and vibration analysis are two predictive maintenance techniques that can increase uptime. IR scans are an effective way to find loose or dirty electrical connections before they cause machine down time. Vibration analyses show bearing faults before the <b>bearing</b> <b>locks</b> up and destroys the journal. Fitesa Washougal is a single machine non-wovens facility in Washougal, Wa. In July 2014 the maintenance team at this facility implemented a new predictive maintenance model. A new CMMS was purchased to better manage assets and preventative maintenance activities. Vibration analysis was contracted to an outside company, and is now done monthly. IR scans are done in-house, with each cabinet in the program scanned quarterly. These actions have resulted in a 3. 5 % increase in uptime. Maintenance spending increased by 31 %, but unplanned maintenance downtime decreased by 34 %...|$|R
40|$|On publication, {{statement}} {{to be provided}} in the format: This is an Accepted Manuscript of an article published by Taylor & Francis in Structure and Infrastructure Engineering on 17 December 2015, available online: [URL] paper illustrates how long-term measurements can be analysed to understand bridge behaviour under changing environmental conditions and how the developed understanding can help explain the performance of its critical components. Measurements from the Cleddau Bridge, a structure that has been continuously monitored {{for more than two}} years, are used to investigate thermal effects in steel box-girder bridges and, in particular, their bearings. Observed temperature distributions are very different to the recommended distributions in design codes (BS EN 1991 - 5 : 2003). These temperature distributions create plan bending of the box girder, which in turn impose forces at the bearings that have contributed to its wear. This paper investigates bearing movements of the bridge using numerical models, and estimates the resulting forces at the supports. A physics-based model of the bridge is created to which temperature distributions inferred from in-situ measurements are supplied as input. Model predictions are validated against measured deformations at the bearings. Subsequently the model is used to predict forces at the bearings due to plan bending and <b>bearing</b> <b>locking.</b> Results quantify the impact that thermal effects have on the performance of the bearings. They also highlight the significance of considering a range of temperature distribution scenarios that go beyond those given in the design codes in order to reliably evaluate thermal effects at the design stage...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Finite element {{analysis}} in aluminum extrusion is faced by several {{problems such as}} number of degrees of freedom, calculation time, large deformation and flow conservation. The problem of large deformation is overcome by applying the Eulerian formulation. The problems concerning number of degrees of freedom, calculation time can be overcome by simplifying the model especially at the bearing corner. On the one hand, detailed modeling of the bearing corner will increase {{the complexity of the}} analysis. On the other hand, simplified modeling of the bearing corner will face problems such as <b>locking</b> of the <b>bearing</b> corner node and loss of flow conservation. A sharp corner and modified corner geometry are examples of the simplified modeling. Moreover, boundary conditions will be applied at the bearing corner node in order {{to solve the problem of}} its locking and to satisfy the flow conservation condition. These boundary conditions include specifying a normal or formulating a constraint equation. This paper focuses on the calculation of the normal or constraint equation that can be applied either at a sharp corner or after modifying the corner geometry. Different elements are checked in this study such as plane strain, axisymmetric and tetrahedron elements. Finally, the extrusion force and average exit velocity are investigated and compared with a reference model. In the reference model a round corner with 0. 5 mm radius is built, contact boundary condition is applied between the die and aluminum, and Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulation is applied. The finite element analysis is performed in the in-house implicit finite element code ”DiekA”...|$|R
