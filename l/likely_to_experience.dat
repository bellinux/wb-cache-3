5|$|A {{number of}} factors affect whether dieting will affect these menstrual processes: age, weight loss and the diet itself. First, younger women are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> menstrual {{irregularities}} due to their diet. Second, menstrual abnormalities are more likely with more weight loss. For example, anovulatory cycles can occur {{as a result of}} adopting a restricted diet, as well as engaging in a high amount of exercise. Finally, the cycle is affected more by a vegetarian diet compared to a non-vegetarian diet.|$|E

5|$|Because American {{football}} is a full-contact sport, head injuries are relatively common. According to the San Francisco Spine Institute at Seton Medical Center in Daly City, California, up to 1.5 million young men participate in football annually, {{and there are}} an estimated 1.2 million football-related injuries per year. An estimated 51% of injuries occur during training sessions, while 49% occur elsewhere. Injuries are nearly 5 times more likely to happen during contact training sessions than in controlled, non-contact sessions. Older players are at the most risk for injuries, while teams with experienced coaches and more assistant coaches are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> injuries. Fifty percent of injuries occur in the lower extremities (with knee injuries alone counting for roughly 36% of all injuries) and 30% occur in the upper extremities.|$|E
25|$|BME LGB {{communities}} are disproportionately affected by homophobic violence, abuse and harassment. In {{a study conducted}} in London, BME LGB people were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> physical abuse, more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> harassment from a stranger and were equally likely to have experienced verbal abuse as their White British LGB counterparts, and due to the pressures of discrimination and victimisation, {{are more likely to}} have poorer mental health.|$|E
25|$|PTSD is {{believed}} to be caused by the experience {{of a wide range of}} traumatic events and, in particular if the trauma is extreme, can occur in persons with no predisposing conditions.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} how inside and outside directors differ in their cognition and reasoning in regards to environmental sustainability issues. The theoretical background derives from a cognitive view and Stakeholder theory. The paper is further based on current research regarding insiders’ and outsiders’ relationship to environmental sustainability. In order to capture the cognition and reasoning of insiders and outsiders, a Think-aloud study was conducted, interviewing a total of 20 board members in the food industry. Results from this study showed that, when faced with environmental issues, outsiders are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> request, repeat, ponder as well as clarify the information given. Secondly, outsiders are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> consider a long-term perspective. Thirdly, outsiders are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> consider an environmental view. Lastly, both insiders and outsiders use analogical reasoning when contemplating around environmental issues. However, insiders are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> draw <b>experience</b> from their current position or company while outsiders are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> draw <b>experience</b> from outside their current position or company when solving environmental issues...|$|R

25|$|Studies {{show that}} {{fraternity}} men {{are three times}} more likely to commit rape than other men on college campuses. Fraternities have often been accused of fostering rape-supportive attitudes by promoting male dominance and brotherhood, and fraternity affiliation has been found to be a significant predictor of sexually predatory behavior in retrospective research. Furthermore, studies show that women in sororities are almost twice as <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> rape than other college women.|$|E
25|$|Moderate {{hookworm}} infections {{have been}} demonstrated to have beneficial effects on hosts suffering from diseases linked to overactive immune systems. This is possibly explained by the hygiene hypothesis. Research at the University of Nottingham conducted in Ethiopia observed a small subset of people with hookworm infections were half as <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> asthma or hay fever. Potential benefits have also been hypothesized in cases of multiple sclerosis, Crohn's Disease and diabetes.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of riding}} helmets {{substantially}} decreases the likelihood {{and severity of}} head injuries. When a rider falls with a helmet, {{he or she is}} five times less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> a traumatic brain injury than a rider who falls without a helmet. Helmets work by crushing on impact and extending the length of time it takes the head to stop moving. Despite this, helmet usage rates in North America are estimated to be between eight and twenty percent.|$|E

25|$|Due to an {{increase}} in Welsh-language nursery education, recent census data reveals a reversal of decades of linguistic decline: there are now more Welsh speakers under five years of age than over 60. For many young people in Wales, the acquisition of Welsh is a gateway to better careers, according to research from the Welsh Language Board and Careers Wales. The Welsh Government identified media as one of six areas <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> greater demand for Welsh speakers: the sector is Wales's third largest revenue earner.|$|E
