The results of the analysis carried out on 105 banks directly participating in the system show that {{after the start of}} Express II, the new security settlement system, the banks held more liquidity reserves for settling securities transactions. The banking system reacted to those changes in a few months' time by raising the <b>liquidity</b> <b>management's</b> efficiency, also thanks to the start of the  RTGS  system's payment optimisation mechanism. The adjustment process would not only allow the banks to completely offset the effect brought about by Express II but even to improve, although slightly, the <b>liquidity</b> <b>management's</b> efficiency compared to prior to the changes.     JEL Codes: D 24;G 21;G 28; E 42 Keywords: Bank; Reserves</p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In today’s banking business, {{liquidity}} risk and its management {{are some of}} the most critical elements that underlie the stability and security of the bank’s operations, profit-making and clients confidence as well as many of the decisions that the bank makes. Managing {{liquidity risk}} in a commercial bank is not some-thing new, yet scientific literature has not focused enough on different approaches to <b>liquidity</b> risk <b>management</b> and assessment. Furthermore, models, methodolo-gies or policies of managing liquidity risk in a commercial bank have never been examined in detail either. The goal of this article is to analyse the liquidity risk of commercial banks as well as the possibilities of managing it and to build a <b>liquidity</b> risk <b>management</b> model for a commercial bank. The development, assessment and application of the commercial bank <b>liquidity</b> risk <b>management</b> was based on an analysis of scientific resources, a comparative analysis and mathematical calculations...|$|R

This research aims at pointing out the main differences between national regulations and supervisory regimes in the most important EU Countries (UK, DE, IT, FR, SP), trying to explain the rationale and the limits of the different approaches. Taking into account <b>liquidity</b> risk <b>management</b> models adopted in the major banking groups within the same countries, this paper also suggests the most significant issues to be considered in order to implement effective <b>liquidity</b> risk <b>management.</b> Areas of convergence/divergence at international level are highlighted and “food for thought” is offered on a subject that is gaining more and more attention of academics and officials worldwide, that is to say the importance of finding regulatory solutions and management models suited to 'remove' systemic crisis. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{availability}} {{and cost of}} liquidity are two crucial issues for the smooth processing of payments in RTGS systems. In TARGET2, liquidity can be managed very flexibly and is available at low cost since fully remunerated minimum reserves - which credit institutions are required to hold with their central bank - {{can be used in}} full for settlement purposes during the day. The averaging provisions applied to minimum reserves allow banks to be flexible in their end-of-day <b>liquidity</b> <b>management.</b> The overnight lending and deposit facilities also allow for continuous <b>liquidity</b> <b>management</b> decisions. The Eurosystem provides intraday credit. This credit must be fully collateralised and no interest is charged. However, all Eurosystem credit must be fully collateralised, i.e. secured by other assets. The range of eligible collateral is very wide. Assets eligible for monetary policy purposes are also eligible for intraday credit. Under Eurosystem rules, credit can only be granted by the national central bank of the Member State where the participant is established. Banks’ treasury managers have a keen interest in the use of automated processes for the optimisation of payment and <b>liquidity</b> <b>management.</b> They need tools {{that will allow them to}} track activity across accounts and, where possible, make accurate intraday and overnight funding decisions from a single location - e.g. their head office.TARGET2 users have, via the Information and Control Module, access to comprehensive online information and easy-to-use <b>liquidity</b> <b>management</b> features that meet their business needs.|$|E
