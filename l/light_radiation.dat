25|$|When {{absorbed by}} cancer cells and exposed to <b>light</b> <b>radiation,</b> the {{reaction}} that creates reactive oxygen damages the DNA, proteins, and lipids {{that make up}} the cancer cell. This cellular damage forces the cancerous cell to go through apoptosis, which can lead to the reduction in size of a tumor. Once the <b>light</b> <b>radiation</b> treatment is finished the fullerene will reabsorb the free radicals to prevent damage of other tissues. Since this treatment focuses on cancer cells, it is a good option for patients whose cancer cells are within reach of <b>light</b> <b>radiation.</b> As this research continues, the treatment may penetrate deeper into the body and be absorbed by cancer cells more effectively.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{varies with}} temperature, density, {{collision}} speed and fuel. To reach net power production, reactions must occur rapidly {{enough to make}} up for energy losses. Plasma clouds lose energy through conduction and radiation. Conduction is when ions, electrons or neutrals touch a surface and escape. Energy is lost with the particle. Radiation is when energy escapes as <b>light.</b> <b>Radiation</b> increases with temperature. To get net power from fusion, these losses must be overcome. This leads to an equation for power output.|$|E

25|$|Gurwitsch {{named the}} {{phenomenon}} mitogenetic radiation since {{he believed that}} this <b>light</b> <b>radiation</b> allowed the morphogenetic field to control embryonic development. His published observations, which related that cell-proliferation of an onion was accelerated by directing these rays down a tube, brought him great attention. Some five hundred attempts at replication, however, produced overwhelmingly negative results, so that the idea was neglected for decades until it commanded some renewed interest in the later 20th century. However the furore, which may have sparked Wilhelm Reich's similar Orgone experiments, brought Gurwitsch an international reputation that led to several European lecture-tours. His work influenced that of Paul Alfred Weiss in particular. William Seifriz regarded the existence of Gurwitsch rays as experimentally proven.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are also}} {{electrostatic}} confinement fusion devices. These devices confine ions using electrostatic fields. The best known is the Fusor. This device has a cathode inside an anode wire cage. Positive ions fly towards the negative inner cage, and are heated by the electric {{field in the}} process. If they miss the inner cage they can collide and fuse. Ions typically hit the cathode, however, creating prohibitory high conduction losses. Also, fusion rates in fusors are very low because of competing physical effects, such as energy loss {{in the form of}} <b>light</b> <b>radiation.</b> Designs have been proposed to avoid the problems associated with the cage, by generating the field using a non-neutral cloud. These include a plasma oscillating device, a [...] a penning trap and the polywell. The technology is relatively immature, however, and many scientific and engineering questions remain.|$|E

He identified the mosquito as the transmitter of malaria, and worked tirelessly on measures to prevent malaria worldwide. The 1903 prize was awarded to Niels Ryberg Finsen, the first Danish laureate, [...] "in recognition of his contribution to the treatment of diseases, especially lupus vulgaris, with concentrated <b>light</b> <b>radiation,</b> whereby he has opened a new avenue for medical science".
