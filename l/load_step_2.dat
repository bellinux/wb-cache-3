40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} the results of numerical analysis of expandable intramedullary nail – femur system in different states of healing. The aim of the research was to determine displacements, deformations and stresses occurring in a bone depending on the age of the patient and the extent level of osteoporosis. Design/methodology/approach: A femur was selected to numerical analysis. The analysis concerned the influence of the load and torsion of the system on the obtained results of displacements, deformations and reduced stresses. In order to make calculations, four models with different mechanical properties were chosen: model 1 : femur with mechanical properties corresponding with a femur of a patient at the age of 16, model 2 : with mechanical properties corresponding with a femur of a patient at the age of about 28, model 3 : with mechanical properties corresponding with a femur of a patient at the age of about 20 and at the age of 50 to 65 years old and model 4 : with mechanical properties corresponding with a femur of a patient at the age above 70 or with osteoporosis. For the chosen model of intramedullary nail, mechanical properties of titan alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V were used. Two load steps were analyzed: load step 1 in which simple axial load with a value ranging from 250 up to 1000 N simulating patient standing on one leg was used, and <b>load</b> <b>step</b> <b>2</b> – a torsion analyzing loads that the nail is exposed to while walking. Findings: Conducted analysis of the system showed the difference in displacements, deformations and reduced stresses depending on assumed mechanical properties of femur and load step of the system. Research limitations/implications: The limitations were connected with the necessity of simplifying the assumptions, which were associated with limitations caused by boundary conditions. In researches 4 forces loading the femur axially were used: 1 : force F = 250 N, 2 : with force F = 500 N, 3 : with force F= 750 N and 4 : with force F = 1000 N and 5 values of angle displacement of the femur head were assumed: 1 : angle displacement φ = 1 °, 2 : φ = 5 °, 3 : φ = 10 °, 4 : φ = 15 °, 5 : φ = 20 °. Practical implications: Obtained results can be applied in selection of stabilization methods of bone fragments and in forecasting biomechanical conditions depending on the age of patient and the state of his general conditions of bones. Originality/value: The paper {{presents the}} displacement-deformation-stress characteristics of femur - expandable intramedullary nail system, using the Finite Elements Method (FEM) in the analysis...|$|E
40|$|A {{ground loads}} {{test of a}} {{full-scale}} wing (175 -ft span) was conducted using a fiber optic strain-sensing system to obtain distributed surface strain data. These data were input into previously developed deformed shape equations to calculate the wing s bending and twist deformation. A photogrammetry system measured actual shape deformation. The wing deflections reached 100 percent of the positive design limit load (equivalent to 3 g) and 97 percent of the negative design limit load (equivalent to - 1 g). The calculated wing bending results were in excellent agreement with the actual bending; tip deflections were within +/- 2. 7 in. (out of 155 -in. max deflection) for 91 percent of the <b>load</b> <b>steps.</b> Experimental testing revealed valuable opportunities for improving the deformed shape equations robustness to real world (not perfect) strain data, which previous analytical testing did not detect. These improvements, which include filtering methods developed in this work, minimize errors due to numerical anomalies discovered in the remaining 9 percent of the <b>load</b> <b>steps.</b> As a result, all <b>load</b> <b>steps</b> attained +/- <b>2.</b> 7 in. accuracy.

40|$|Axial Flow Chromatography (AFC) {{is widely}} used for the {{purification}} of therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies (MAbs). However, AFC columns can generate high pressure drops across the resin bed, preventing operation of the column at high flow rates especially at pilot or manufacturing-scales. Radial Flow Chromatography (RFC) was developed to provide lower pressure drops during chromatographic separations. In these studies, small and pilot-scale columns were used to evaluate purification of a MAb using both AFC and RFC technologies. A bench-scale, wedge RFC column (250 mL) was compared to a bench-scale AFC column at various linear velocities with resulting Residence Times (RT) using Protein A resin for the recovery of a monoclonal antibody. The bench RFC column was successfully operated at 4. 5 min RT for equilibration and <b>loading</b> <b>steps</b> and <b>2</b> min RT for washing, elution and cleaning steps without compromising yield. The RFC column had approximately 50 % lower pressure drop than the AFC column at similar flow rates. The process was then scaled-up to 5 L using a pilot-scale RFC column. The 5 -L RFC column was operated at 4. 5 min RT for equilibration and loading and 2 min. RT for washing, elution and cleaning with no loss of yield. However, pressure drop across the 5 L RFC column was higher than expected, but antibody recovery yields were similar for both column types. Subsequent investigations revealed a potential design issue with the RFC column. Overall, RFC has great potential {{to be used for}} pilot or manufacturing scale without high pressure drop concerns, which will certainly improve processing efficiency...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a two-step method for dimensioning and time-sequential operation of Wind-hydrogen (H 2) plants operating in power markets. Step 1 involves identification of grid constraints and marginal power losses through <b>load</b> flow simulations. <b>Step</b> <b>2</b> involves solving {{a model for}} optimization of the component sizes (wind turbine, electrolyser, H 2 storage, fuel cell) and the corresponding time-sequential operation of each component. Results are presented through {{a case study of}} a Norwegian island with good wind resources, a weak connection to the main transmission grid and a commuting ferry, constituting the H 2 load. Main results show that if H 2 consumers are willing to pay at least 0. 31 – 0. 34 € per Nm 3, the wind power penetration could be cost-effectively increased by 1. 8 – 1. 9 MW by including an average H 2 load of 1. 36 MW. The H 2 plant is very dependent on power import and H 2 storage capacity is only 1. 5 – 2 days of average demand. The operational flexibility of the H 2 plant opens for a more optimal power exchange with the grid. It is concluded that H 2 produced from wind power could be competitive with fossil fuels. H 2 is however not cost-effective as electric energy storage for wind power plants operating in power markets...|$|R

The {{deformation}} is {{an important}} parameter in structural health monitoring, and a conjugate beam method based on long-gauge fiber Bragg grating distributed strain sensing techniques is proposed to obtain the deformation of a structure.

For the phase angle 0 &# 176;, some special features can be observed in the crack initial zone, such as the tire pattern,fishbone pattern and stalactite pattern.

The classical computational strategy, according to which, plastic loading is tested at the Gauss points of each element {{and an independent}} return mapping algorithm is performed for given incremental displacements, is consistently derived from a suitably discretized version of a min-max variational principle. The sequence of solution phases to be performed within each <b>load</b> <b>step</b> adopting a full Newton's method is illustrated in detail {{and the importance of}} a correct update of the plastic strains is emphasized. It is further shown that, in order to increase the rate of convergence and the stability properties of the Newton's method, the consistent elastoplastic tangent operator must be exploited even at the first iteration of each <b>load</b> <b>step</b> subsequent to the first yielding of the structural model. This is in contrast with the traditional implementation according to which the elastic operator is used at the first iteration of each <b>load</b> <b>step.</b> The effectiveness of the present approach is shown by a set of numerical examples referred to plane strain problems...|$|R
40|$|This study explores key {{computational}} {{issues that}} aect analyses employing the computational cell methodology to predict crack growth in ductile metals caused by void growth and coalescence. These issues — computational <b>load</b> <b>step</b> size, procedures to remove cells with high porosity from the analysis, and the porosity for cell deletion — can adversely aect predicted crack growth resistance (R) curves and/or hinder convergence of both local constitutive and global iterative computations. Strain increments generated by large computational <b>load</b> <b>steps</b> introduce {{errors in the}} predicted peak stress of computational cells and prevent convergence of stress updates for the Gurson–Tvergaard constitutive model. An adaptive load control algorithm, which limits the maximum porosity over a <b>load</b> <b>step,</b> eliminates this problem. The delayed release of remaining forces in newly deleted cells elements elevates the stress triaxiality and thus artificially accelerates the rate of crack extension. The release of cell forces using a traction-separation model minimizes this eect while maintaining good numerical convergence of the solutions. Crack growth analyses for a moderate strength steel demonstrate that critical porosity values 8 ̆ 5 fE between 0. 1 and 0. 2 show almost no eect on predicted R-curves, while both larger and smaller values lead to low J–Da curves. Finally, a parametric study indicates that specimens of low-hardening materials and specimens with high crack-front constraint show a stronger influence of large computational <b>load</b> <b>steps</b> and the delayed release of cell forces.
