5|$|Rubidium and caesium {{were the}} first {{elements}} to be discovered using the spectroscope, invented in 1859 by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff. The next year, they discovered caesium in the mineral water from Bad Dürkheim, Germany. Their discovery of rubidium came the following year in Heidelberg, Germany, finding it in the mineral lepidolite. The names of rubidium and caesium come from the most prominent lines in their emission spectra: a bright red <b>line</b> <b>for</b> rubidium (from the Latin word rubidus, meaning dark red or bright red), and a sky-blue <b>line</b> <b>for</b> caesium (derived from the Latin word caesius, meaning sky-blue).|$|E
