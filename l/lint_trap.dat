500|$|Officials {{believe that}} a knife from the kitchen had been smeared with blood and placed near the body, while a {{duplicate}} of the knife which was missing from a set found in Ward's bedroom {{would have been more}} consistent with the wounds to Wone's body. The autopsy revealed evidence of some degree of suffocation, perhaps by a pillow, and puncture marks on his neck, chest, foot and hand. Though no toxins were found in his blood, a lack of evidence of struggle led investigators to suspect Wone had been injected with a paralytic agent. Cadaver dogs found a blood residue in a dryer <b>lint</b> <b>trap</b> and the patio drain, which detectives believe may be evidence that someone washed themselves in the back patio area, and dried wet clothes in the dryer. City Paper Columnist Jason Cherkis reported unattributed criticism of the medical examiner's failure to test for exotic drugs and to keep a sample of Wone's blood for later testing, as well as detectives' failure to follow up on a <b>lint</b> <b>trap</b> that had attracted a cadaver dog's attention. Price's lawyer has challenged the timing of the indictments, has said that the civil suit [...] "looked unseemly", and questioned whether the prosecutors and Wone family attorneys were acting in concert.|$|E
50|$|A <b>lint</b> <b>trap</b> {{can also}} be built {{into the center of}} the agitator, passively {{collecting}} lint from water forced through the agitator. Front-loaders tend to require separate pumps and plumbing to provide lint filters which are often mounted behind covers on the bottom of the machine.|$|E

2500|$|For some cuffs, a {{matching}} limb protection sleeve {{is available to}} help protect soft tissues under the cuff. [...] Without proper protection, underlying soft tissue is prone to damage caused by wrinkling, pinching or shearing. [...] Sleeves are sized according to the cuff width and the patient’s limb circumference. [...] They are intended to fit snugly and extend beyond {{the edge of the}} cuff to ensure that there is no direct contact between cuff and skin. [...] Sleeve materials that do not shed loose fibers are chosen to avoid <b>lint</b> becoming <b>trapped</b> in the cuff’s hook and loop fasteners, which reduces their effectiveness.|$|R

50|$|Improvised {{methods of}} {{salvaging}} this heat for in-home heating, {{by use of}} inline vent boxes equipped with a flapper valve to redirect moist heated air to indoor areas, will also increase humidity within a dwelling. Although this may be beneficial in dry winter conditions, excess humidity from these devices increases likelihood of mold, mildew, and bacterial growth inside a home. Indoor venting may also be against local regulations. Gas dryers must always be vented outdoors, as the products of combustion are mixed with the moist air. Building codes and manufacturers' instructions usually recommended that dryers vent outdoors. An indoor <b>lint</b> <b>trap</b> kit poses a similar concern of increased humidity within the dwelling.|$|E
50|$|The idea {{of using}} laundry as a metaphor become a {{creative}} writing project for Horak and Wynne, influencing the band's style and musical direction. The lyrics appear on the surface {{to be concerned with}} laundry, however, “The songs are heavy on double entendres and each song is couched in reality: Come Clean is about love while <b>Lint</b> <b>Trap</b> is about lying.” Other critics agreed, “With some bands of this ilk, things get gimmicky, but listening to the album, it’s just easy to enjoy the rock ’n’ roll and have the occasional chuckle at the lyrics.”Branding itself as laundrock, a combination of garage-rock, mod, beat, psych, punk, and doo-wop, The Laundronauts sought to create a new sound from what they considered were the best elements of various genres. The Laundronauts' songs seldom run longer than three minutes and the arrangements are designed to be tight and punchy. Vocal harmonies are a key element of the sound and every band member has vocal duties. Horak'sguitar effects are also a characteristic element of The Laundronauts' sound. An electronics expert, Horak has created a broad range of sounds through use of upwards twenty pedals - several of which he created - and multiple amplifiers that make the trio sound more like a five-piece.|$|E
