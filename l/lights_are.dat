5|$|Incandescent <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> {{filled with}} argon, to {{preserve}} the filaments at high temperature from oxidation. It {{is used for the}} specific way it ionizes and emits light, such as in plasma globes and calorimetry in experimental particle physics. Gas-discharge lamps filled with pure argon provide lilac/violet light; with argon and some mercury, blue light. Argon is also used for blue and green argon-ion lasers.|$|E
5|$|The {{tradition}} of lighting the trees of The Magnificent Mile {{to start the}} Christmas season extends more than forty years. More than one million <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> lit and fireworks follow the event. The Magnificent Mile Lights Festival, presented by BMO Harris Bank, is the annual kick-off to Chicago's Christmas season.|$|E
5|$|Audience {{etiquette}} {{is generally}} similar to formal western theatre—the audience quietly watches. Surtitles are not used, but some audience members follow {{along in the}} libretto. Because there are no curtains on the stage, the performance begins with the actors entering the stage and ends with their leaving the stage. The house <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> usually kept on during the performances, creating an intimate feel that provides a shared experience between the performers and the audience.|$|E
50|$|The Liston Rear Range <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> {{one of four}} lights {{forming a}} complex known as Liston's Tree Range. One set of two <b>lights</b> <b>was</b> located in New Jersey, forming the Finn's Point Range Lights, with the other pair in Delaware became the Port Penn Range Lights. The front <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> placed in low wood-framed structures, while the rear <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> {{designed}} as tall, skeletal wrought iron towers. Both rear <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> substantially similar, except that the rear Port Penn <b>light</b> <b>was</b> 30 ft higher.|$|R
5000|$|Deer Island <b>Light</b> <b>is</b> a {{lighthouse}} in Boston Harbor, Boston, Massachusetts.The actual <b>light</b> <b>is</b> 53 ft above Mean High Water. Its alternating {{white and red}} <b>light</b> <b>is</b> visible for [...]|$|R
50|$|HOL <b>Light</b> <b>is</b> {{a member}} of the HOL theorem prover family. Like the other members, it is a proof {{assistant}} for classical higher order logic. Compared with other HOL systems, HOL <b>Light</b> <b>is</b> intended to have relatively simple foundations. HOL <b>Light</b> <b>is</b> authored and maintained by the mathematician and computer scientist John Harrison. HOL <b>Light</b> <b>is</b> released under the simplified BSD license.|$|R
5|$|In addition, {{there are}} eight {{different}} neighborhood associations, each of which provides different levels of infrastructure on each street. For example, on 4th Street the street <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> designed as old lamp posts and there are ornamented trash cans with a fleur-de-lis symbol at frequent intervals, while on St. James Court there are gas lamp posts, 3rd and 2nd Streets have small light posts on the sidewalks, Ouerbacker Court has cast iron decorative gates, and several other streets have basic infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Most major {{internal}} {{roads are}} dual-carriageways {{and the city}} is linked by roads to other towns in Sarawak. These roads are mainly federal roads maintained by the national Public Works Department. The city also famous {{for a number of}} roundabouts including the oldest and largest one, known as Datuk Abang Kipali Bin Abang Akip Roundabout. The roundabout are usually landscaped and were efficient to handling traffic congestion. However, traffic <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> more commonly used now as the city traffic continues to rise.|$|E
5|$|The {{crown of}} the South Tower {{contains}} {{a band of}} 25 LED floodlights that remain lit all night. Each LED light consumes little energy and has a lifetime of 40,000 hours. These <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> used to signal the weather, just like {{the lights on the}} John Hancock Tower in Boston. The crown glows red if warmer weather is in the forecast. A blue crown signifies that cold weather is expected soon. Green means that there is at least a 50 percent chance of rain. Amber indicates that the weather will remain unchanged. This is the San Francisco Bay Area's first weather beacon. The crown began lighting up on December 8, 2008.|$|E
50|$|The font Calibri <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced}} in Microsoft Windows 8. From Microsoft Word 2013 onwards, Calibri and Calibri <b>Light</b> <b>are</b> the default fonts for body text and headings respectively. Calibri <b>Light</b> <b>is</b> also {{commonly used in}} Powerpoint templates.|$|R
50|$|The Penfield Reef <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> {{constructed}} in 1874. The <b>light</b> <b>is</b> an active aid to navigation.|$|R
50|$|In 1901, the Front <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> about 360 ft {{southeast}} of the southeastern angle of Fort Moultrie, and the other <b>light</b> <b>was</b> about 190 ft {{to the east of}} the Front <b>light.</b> The <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> eventually removed at an unknown date.|$|R
5|$|The {{festival is}} powered by Aggreko who provide over 27 megawatts of power to the site with 250 bio-diesel generators, run on 60,000 litres of waste {{vegetable}} oil (WVO) fuel. The power generated is enough to power the city of Bath and the Pyramid Stage {{is powered by}} 4 generators itself. There is 24km of festoon lighting around the site, also installed by Aggreko. This is run with time clocks so the <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> only on when they are needed, contributing to the festival's green requirements.|$|E
5|$|By Your Side was {{released}} on January12, 1999. The album's cover art is a blue-tinted nighttime photograph of the band, all dressed in white and {{standing in front of}} a lake. The band name is rendered in tiny white lights above their heads, and other small white <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> scattered at their feet. In keeping with the tiny lights theme, the back of the booklet shows a satellite image of the United States at night, in which densely populated areas can be discerned by light pollution, and the booklet contains drawings of constellations. The album's disc artwork is designed after a centaur with a crow's head in place of the man's head.|$|E
5|$|Finally, at the end, a bus {{shows up}} outside the Krusty Krab, despite Squidward {{claiming}} that the buses do not run this late at night. The bus then drops off a mysterious dark silhouette matching {{the description of the}} Hash-Slinging Slasher. SpongeBob and Squidward immediately realize that they are experiencing genuine supernatural events and panic. When the strange, unidentified figure enters the building, it is revealed he is simply a kid applying for a job, stating that he had tried calling the Krusty Krab by telephone earlier, but had hung up out of nervousness (the bus that he arrived in remains unexplained). However, Squidward then questions who was flickering the lights earlier. It is then revealed that the flickering <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> caused by doctored footage of Count Orlok from the 1922 silent film Nosferatu, with whom the characters are inexplicably familiar, flicking the light switch on and off.|$|E
50|$|In fish-only marine aquariums, <b>lighting</b> <b>is</b> {{intended}} {{only for}} illumination. <b>Lighting</b> <b>is</b> chosen primarily with aesthetic considerations for optimal viewing of the fish. The <b>lighting</b> <b>is</b> generally of much lower intensity than {{is used in}} reef aquariums to limit algae growth.|$|R
50|$|In 1966 the <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{dismantled}} and {{a modern}} automated <b>light</b> <b>was</b> erected {{on the old}} foundation.|$|R
50|$|The Northport Range <b>Lights</b> <b>were</b> a set {{of range}} lights on Prince Edward Island, Canada. They were built in 1885, and the rear <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{deactivated}} around 1970; the front <b>light</b> <b>is</b> still active as the rear light of the new range.|$|R
5|$|Mauna Kea's {{summit is}} one of the best sites in the world for astronomical {{observation}} due to favorable observing conditions. The arid conditions are important for submillimeter and infrared astronomy for this region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The summit is above the inversion layer, keeping most cloud cover below the summit and ensuring the air on the summit is dry, and free of atmospheric pollution. The summit atmosphere is exceptionally stable, lacking turbulence for some of the world's best astronomical seeing. The very dark skies resulting from Mauna Kea's distance from city <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> preserved by legislation that minimizes light pollution from the surrounding area; the darkness level allows the observation of faint astronomical objects. These factors historically made Mauna Kea an excellent spot for stargazing.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the top of}} the inrun, {{there is}} a 'start gate' – a metal or wooden beam – on which an athlete sits and awaits their signal to jump via a set of traffic lights (green, amber, and red). These <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> {{operated}} directly by Borek Sedlák. An athlete may enter the gate when amber is shown. If red is shown after this point, the wind conditions will have been deemed unfavourable for a safe jump: the athlete must then carefully exit the gate as they had entered it and await another opportunity to jump. Failure to dismount the gate within ten to fifteen seconds of being shown a red light, or jumping without having been given the signal to go, will disqualify the athlete.|$|E
5|$|Unveiled in 1989, the new {{lighting}} arrangement {{required the}} removal of the contour-outlining light bulbs and the installation of 176floodlights in and around the tower's frame. From dusk to midnight, the floodlights illuminate the entire tower. Sodium vapor lamps are used from 2 October to 6 July to cover the tower in an orange color. From 7 July to 1 October, the <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> changed to metal halide lamps to illuminate the tower with a white color. The reasoning behind the change is a seasonal one. Ishii reasoned that orange is a warmer color and helps to offset the cold winter months. Conversely, white is thought a cool color that helps during the hot summer months.|$|E
50|$|The {{front and}} rear range <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> part of the United States Life-Saving Station that was {{established}} on Plum Island in 1896. The <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> originally lit in 1897 and are 1650 ft apart, aligned on a 330° bearing line to guide boats safely into the Porte des Morts Passage. The Plum Island front range <b>light</b> <b>was</b> originally identical to the front range light of the Baileys Harbor Range <b>Lights,</b> but <b>was</b> replaced by a modern skeletal light in 1964. The rear range <b>light</b> <b>is</b> the original tower and {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1984, as the Plum Island Range Rear Light, reference number #84003659. The front <b>light</b> <b>is</b> directional, aligned on 330.5° true. The rear <b>light</b> <b>is</b> omnidirectional and still has its original 4th order Fresnel lens.|$|R
5000|$|An {{example of}} a {{complete}} <b>light</b> characteristic <b>is</b> [...] "Gp Oc(3) W 10s 15m 10M". This indicates that the <b>light</b> <b>is</b> a group occulting light in which {{a group of three}} eclipses repeat every 10 seconds; the <b>light</b> <b>is</b> white; the <b>light</b> <b>is</b> 15 metres above the chart datum and is visible for 10 nmi km.|$|R
50|$|In 1933, the {{automated}} <b>light</b> <b>was</b> dismantled, and the Coast Guard constructed a 50 ft steel tower {{in front of}} the lighthouse. The automated <b>light</b> <b>was</b> placed on top until 1985, when the <b>light</b> <b>was</b> placed back in the lighthouse and the tower was removed.|$|R
5|$|When first {{playing the}} game, the {{scenarios}} for all five heroines and additional smaller scenarios {{are available in}} {{what is called the}} School Life story arc. When the player completes a character's scenario, he or she receives an orb of light. When eight of these <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> obtained, the game's second story arc, called After Story, is made available. One of the lights disappears during School Life, but reappears in After Story. To view the true ending of Clannad, all 13 lights must be obtained. Originally, the lights were meant to be items that players could use in the game, but since this increased the game's complexity, and detracted from the storyline, the function of the lights was simplified and made less intrusive.|$|E
5|$|Like the original, {{there are}} the {{challenge}} and head-to-head game modes. In challenge mode, players play a series of races against three opponents and must finish first or second to progress to the next race. If a good enough lap time {{on any of the}} earlier levels is achieved, players automatically win the race. Placing first three times in a row earns players the chance to win an extra life by playing a special round to collect vehicles within a time limit. Head-to-head is a game which involves one opponent achieving enough distance from opponents to be the only racer on the screen. This earns that player a point, represented by coloured lights on the screen: one light turns the colour of that player. If all eight <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> one colour, the player of that colour wins. If after three laps, the colours are mixed, the player with the most lights wins. Players are given thee lives in both modes. Players select a character, whose stats only affect computer-controlled players, to play as before racing.|$|E
25|$|House {{and work}} <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> usually off during {{performances}} but are occasionally {{included in the}} lighting design to establish focus or emphasize plot elements. When the house <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> not on a dimmer, the switch is usually {{under the control of}} the stage manager.|$|E
50|$|Vehicles {{produced}} between 1965 - 1979 were {{equipped with}} old-style lights: turn signal <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> colorless (white), rear <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> round, {{and the back}} of the body was rounder. Subsequent post-1979 models got amber (yellow) signal lights, and rear <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> slightly bigger and rectangular.|$|R
5000|$|Soft light {{refers to}} light {{that tends to}} [...] "wrap" [...] around objects, casting diffuse shadows with soft edges. Soft <b>light</b> <b>is</b> when a <b>light</b> source <b>is</b> large {{relative}} to the subject; hard <b>light</b> <b>is</b> when the <b>light</b> source <b>is</b> small relative to the subject.|$|R
50|$|The <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} in 1871. The <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{one of a}} group of New England lighthouses built to the same plan after an award-winning design by a Vermont architect. Nearly identical <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> constructed at Sabin Point, Rose Island, and Colchester Reef. It was deactivated in 1974, but relighted on July 30, 2006. The <b>light</b> <b>was</b> added to the National Register of Historic Places as Pomham Rocks Light Station on July 9, 1979. In the 1970s the <b>light</b> <b>was</b> sold to The American Lighthouse Foundation, and is today managed by the Friends of Pomham Rocks Lighthouse.|$|R
25|$|Red {{almost always}} denotes an {{emergency}} vehicle if the <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> facing forward.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{efficient}} LED <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> {{on trial}} in train car 1328 and 3328.|$|E
25|$|To {{help reduce}} water usage when restrooms are closed, some restrooms with timed {{flushing}} use an electric water valve {{connected to the}} restroom light switch. When the building is in active use {{during the day and}} the <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> on, the timed flush operates normally. At night when the building is closed, the <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> turned off and the flushing action stops.|$|E
50|$|The Passage <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> one of {{the last}} <b>lights</b> to <b>be</b> {{constructed}} on the Great Lakes. The <b>light</b> <b>was</b> built {{at the same time that}} the 1895 lighthouse was deactivated. In 1959, the lighthouse's beacon characteristic was changed from green to a flashing red light, and the radiobeacon distance-finding system was deactivated in 1962. In 1968 the formerly all-white <b>light</b> <b>was</b> given a red-painted base on a white pier. In 1973 the <b>light</b> <b>was</b> automated, and the steel antenna tower was removed in the early 2000s.|$|R
50|$|Monochromators {{are used}} in many optical {{measuring}} instruments and in other applications where tunable monochromatic <b>light</b> <b>is</b> wanted. Sometimes the monochromatic <b>light</b> <b>is</b> directed at a sample and the reflected or transmitted <b>light</b> <b>is</b> measured. Sometimes white <b>light</b> <b>is</b> directed at a sample and the monochromator is {{used to analyze the}} reflected or transmitted <b>light.</b> Two monochromators <b>are</b> used in many fluorometers; one monochromator is used to select the excitation wavelength and a second monochromator is used to analyze the emitted light.|$|R
50|$|Best {{views of}} this <b>light</b> <b>are</b> from the water. The privately owned island and <b>light</b> <b>are</b> {{closed to the}} public.|$|R
