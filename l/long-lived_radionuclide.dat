[...] The reason for this is the occurrence of certain long-lived radioactive primordial nuclides in nature, which may form admixtures with the monoisotopics, and thus prevent them from being naturally mononuclidic. This happens in the cases of 7 (...) of the monoisotopic elements. These isotopes are monoisotopic, but due to the presence of the long lived radioactive primordial nuclide, are not mononuclidic. These elements are vanadium, rubidium, indium, lanthanum, europium, rhenium and lutetium. See the list below; in two noted cases (indium and rhenium), the <b>long-lived</b> <b>radionuclide</b> is actually the most abundant isotope in nature, and the stable isotope is less abundant.|$|E

For extraction chromatography, we used commercially available columns of crown ether (Sr and Pb), supported quaterner amine (Tc), phosphonate derivative (Pu), di-phosphonate derivative (transuranium nuclides), or homemade columns of di-methyl-glyoxime and methyl-i-butyl-ketone (Ni and Fe, respectively).

40|$|The radon- 222 progeny and <b>long-lived</b> <b>radionuclide</b> {{measurements}} {{were done in}} a wet underground uranium mine in Saskatchewan, Canada, on Nov. 8 - 12, 1995. Radon- 222 in the mine varied from 2 kBq/m{sup 3 } at 90 m below surface to 12 kBq/m{sup 3 } in the mining areas, 240 m below surface. Radon- 222 progeny activity and potential alpha energy concentration appear affected by the airborne particle number concentration and size distribution. Particle number was up to 200 x 10 {sup 3 }/cm{sup 3 }. Only an accumulation mode (30 - 1000 nm) and some bimodal size distributions in this accumulation size range were significant. Diesel particles and combustion particles from burning propane caused a major modal diameter shift to a smaller size range (50 - 85 nm) compared with previous values (100 - 200 nm). The high particle number reduced the unattached progeny (0. 5 - 2 nm) to > 5 %. The nuclei mode (2 - 30 nm) in this test was nonexistent, and the coarse mode (> 1000 nm), except from the drilling areas and on the stopes, was mostly not measurable. Airborne particle total mass and long- lived radionuclide alpha activity concentrations were very low (80 - 100 {mu}g/m{sup 3 } and 4 - 5 mBq/m{sup 3 }) owing to high ventilation rates. Mass-weighted size distributions were trimodal, with the major mode at the accumulation size region, which accounts for 45 - 50 % of the mass. The coarse model contains the the least mass, about 20 %. The size spectra from gross alpha activities were bimodal with major mode in the coarse region (> 1000 nm) and a minor accumulation mode in the 50 - 900 nm size range. These size spectra were different from the {sup 222 }Rn progeny that showed a single accumulation mode in the 50 - 85 nm size region.

Heating by the decay of 26 Al efficiently melts the interior of Rhea, a Saturnian satellite with a radius of 764 km (Czechowski, 2012).

This work focuses on the interactions of several important <b>long-lived</b> <b>radionuclide</b> cations with dissolved organic matter (DOM) constituents (humic and fulvic acids) under high pH conditions. We also sought to test the comprehensive speciation model WHAM/Humic Ion Binding Model VII for these specific conditions. Results for Th demonstrate high fractions present as organic complexes at all pH values. Binding of neptunyl to DOM shows a maximum over the pH range expected within an evolving repository. Uranyl exhibits decreasing binding with pH, however, the majority of metal in solution is present as organic complexes under the lower pH conditions investigated (10 – 10. 5). We have updated the WHAM/ Model VII binding values for UO 2 þ 2, and have {{for the first time}} added NpOþ 2 values to the database. These updates now llow application of the model for more complex mixtures across the entire repository pH range. Calculations for three simulated cement interstitial waters (representing different degradation phases) suggest U(VI) and Np(V) {{are not likely to be}} significantly bound to DOM under these conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{presence}} of <b>long-lived</b> <b>radionuclides</b> {{is a challenge}} to the management of high level liquid waste (HLLW). Separation of minor acitinides and long-lived fission products from the HLLW by partitioning process has the potential of significantly decreasing the costs of the immobilization and disposal of the radioactive waste by minimizing waste volumes. Several solvent extraction processes have been developed and demonstrated at the Institute of Nuclear and New Energy Technology (INET) for the separation of transuranic elements...|$|R
40|$|Targets {{of silicon}} and silicon dioxide were {{irradiated}} with spallation neutrons {{to simulate the}} production of <b>long-lived</b> <b>radionuclides</b> in {{the surface of the}} Earth. Gamma-ray spectroscopy was used to measure Be- 7 and Na- 22, and accelerator mass spectrometry was used to measure Be- 10, C- 14, and Al- 26. The measured ratios of these nuclides are compared with calculated ratios and with ratios from other simulations and agree well with ratios inferred from terrestrial samples...|$|R

The objective of the research work carried out under FP 5 is to provide a basis for evaluating the practicability, on an industrial scale, of P&T for reducing the amount of long lived radionuclides to be disposed of. The content and the implementation of the EURATOM FP 5 are briefly presented. The research projects on P&T selected for funding after the first call for proposals are then briefly described. They address the chemical separation of <b>long-lived</b> <b>radionuclides</b> and the acquisition of technological and basic data, necessary for the development of an accelerator driven system. Other projects are expected in response to the next call with a deadline in January 2001. International co-operation in P&T should be fostered. Collaboration is being implemented in this field between scientists of the European Union (EU) and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Finally, a brief outline of the discussions for the preparation of the Sixth Framework Programme (2002 - 2006) is given. 176 1...|$|R
