2500|$|Sullivan praised Elvis {{at the end}} of the show, saying [...] "This is a real decent, fine boy. We've {{never had}} a pleasanter {{experience}} on our show with a big name than we've had with you.... You're thoroughly all right"—a remark that could either be interpreted as a [...] "ringing endorsement" [...] that [...] "legitimized the singer with an adult audience" [...] or as [...] "a somewhat hypocritical statement considering what the CBS censors had just done to his performance on that show." [...] Eyewitness Jerry Schilling writes, [...] "The way Elvis <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> us at that moment, I thought I could see a mix of hurt over the attacks he’d been subjected to in the press, and a deep pride in who he was and what he was doing." [...] (According to historian Tim Parrish, Presley's manager, Colonel Parker, [...] "had threatened to remove Elvis from the show if Sullivan did not apologize for telling the press that Elvis's 'gyrations' were immoral.") Reflecting on the event in 1969, Presley claimed that Sullivan had expressed a very different opinion off-camera: [...] "So they arranged to put me on television. At that particular time there was a lot of controversy—you didn't see people moving—out in public. They were gettin' it on in the back rooms, but you didn't see it out in public too much. So there was a lot of controversy ... and I went to the Ed Sullivan Show. They photographed me from the waist up. And Sullivan's standing over there saying, 'Sumbitch.' I said, 'Thank you, Ed, thank you.' I didn't know what he was calling me, at the time." ...|$|E
