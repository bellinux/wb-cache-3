5|$|In 1940, the German {{government}} began to liquidate Jewish businesses. Some {{were transferred to}} German ownership in a process termed Aryanization.

40|$|We solve a {{liquidation}} {{problem for}} an agent with prospect theory preferences who seeks {{to sell a}} portfolio of (divisible) claims on an underlying asset. Our methodology enables us to consider different formulations of prospect preferences in the literature, and various asset price processes. We find that these differences in specification are important - for instance, with piecewise power functions (but not piecewise exponentials) the agent may voluntarily <b>liquidate</b> at a loss relative to break-even. Further, {{we find that the}} likelihood of <b>liquidating</b> at a (small) gain is much higher than <b>liquidating</b> at a (large) loss, consistent with the disposition effect documented in empirical and experimental studies. The ability to partially <b>liquidate</b> also has significant consequences. The prospect agent <b>liquidates</b> the entire position at once, in contrast to behavior under standard concave preferences. If the position is divisible, under piecewise exponential functions, the agent no longer <b>liquidates</b> at the break-even level, and even if the asset is very poor, prefers to gamble on the possibility of <b>liquidating</b> at a gain. Finally, the piecewise power specification remains consistent with the disposition effect, albeit where the whole portfolio is sold at once...|$|R
40|$|Voluntary liquidations {{offer an}} {{interesting}} example of efficient and orderly asset reallocation. This study examines why firms <b>liquidate,</b> {{and what happens}} to their assets. One important determinant of voluntary liquidation concerns asset performance and marketability: <b>liquidating</b> firms have low asset productivity, low market-to-book ratios, and high liquidity. Another important determinant concerns management having the proper incentives to liquidate: high inside ownership, takeover pressure, and low debt levels. Financial factors thus establish whether a liquidation is profitable, while organizational factors determine whether management chooses to <b>liquidate.</b> The study also finds that many <b>liquidating</b> firm assets are sold to firms operating in the same industry. Returns to <b>liquidating</b> firm shareholders are significantly greater here, rather than when they are sold to firms in a different industry. Moreover, intra-industry liquidations tend to occur in superior performing industries when industry performance is at a peak. Business failures...|$|R

5|$|Churchill Machine Tools (Coventry) Ltd (company {{registration}} 00087969) was <b>liquidated</b> in 1974.

50|$|A <b>liquidating</b> {{distribution}} (or <b>liquidating</b> dividend) {{is a type}} of nondividend distribution made by {{a corporation}} or a partnership to its shareholders during its partial or complete liquidation. <b>Liquidating</b> distributions are not paid solely out of the profits of the corporation. Instead, the entire amount of shareholders' equity is distributed. When a company has more liabilities than assets, equity is negative and no <b>liquidating</b> distribution is made at all. This is usually the case in bankruptcy liquidations. Creditors are always senior to shareholders in receiving the corporation's assets upon winding up. However, in case all debts to creditors have been fully satisfied, there is a surplus left to divide among equity-holders. This mainly occurs during voluntary liquidations of solvent corporations.|$|R

In the 1930s it associated 27 local branches. After World War II it operated half-legally and as Siła, was <b>liquidated</b> by Czechoslovak communist authorities after the Victorious February 1948.

They were bought out by Sir Henry Norris that year and to improve the club's financial standing, he moved the team to Arsenal Stadium, Highbury, north London in 1913. After the First World War he arranged for the club's promotion back to the First Division, in controversial circumstances.|$|E
40|$|A {{bank with}} a {{substantial}} amount of nonperforming assets may transfer some or all of those assets to a newly created bank whose stock will be distributed to existing shareholders or to new investors.

5|$|Because the Lithuanians did {{not have}} a list of PMO members, they did not arrest the main leaders. Also, provincial PMO {{branches}} remained intact. Therefore, on September 17, 1919, new orders were issued scheduling the second coup attempt for the end of September. This attempt was also discovered. A Lithuanian woman succeeded in convincing Petras Vrubliauskas, PMO deputy commander in Vilnius, to transfer the PMO document archive to the Lithuanians. On September 21, the Lithuanians obtained a full list of PMO members and supporters and arrested them in the following days.

He was deported from Australia in April 1990 and charged with drug possession in November 1991 and March 1992. That October, his estate company was <b>liquidated</b> with debts over £650,000. In June 1993, he avoided a jail sentence by being ordered to attend a rehabilitation clinic, but travelled to the South of France instead and was sentenced to 10 months in an open prison, where he was released after five.
