After adjustment for baseline immune function, the mean 6 -month CD 4 cell decline was not significantly different (34. 5 vs. 45. 6 cells, respectively, P =. 14). Second, the plasma HIV burden at baseline skin testing was compared for 33 tuberculin-positive cases and 33 matched tuberculin-negative controls.

A 65 -year-old female diagnosed with <b>latent</b> Mycobacterium <b>tuberculosis</b> infection was receiving oral isoniazid 300 [*]mg daily. She was admitted to the hospital for epigastric and right sided flank pain of one-week duration. Laboratory results and imaging confirmed hepatitis.

After discharge, the patient was readmitted and suffered from severe coagulopathy, metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury, hepatic encephalopathy, and cardiorespiratory arrest necessitating two rounds of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Despite maximal hemodynamic support, the patient did not survive. A review of the literature, from several European countries and the United States of America, revealed a low incidence of mortality due to isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity when used as a single agent for <b>latent</b> Mycobacterium <b>tuberculosis</b> infection.

ABSTRACT An {{estimated}} {{one-third of the}} world’s population is currently latently infected with Mycobacterium <b>tuberculosis.</b> <b>Latent</b> M. <b>tuberculosis</b> infection (LTBI) progresses into active tuberculosis (TB) disease in ~ 5 to 10 % of infected individuals. Di-agnostic and prognostic biomarkers to monitor disease progression are urgently needed to ensure better care for TB patients and to decrease the spread of TB. Biomarker development is primarily based on transcriptomics. Our understanding of biology com-bined with evolving technical advances in high-throughput techniques led us to investigate the possibility of additional plat-forms (epigenetics and proteomics) in the quest to (i) understand the biology of the TB host response and (ii) search for multi-platform biosignatures in TB.
