50|$|An {{accommodation}} {{strategy was}} compiled in November 2010 {{with the aim}} to expand university accommodation outside the campus to accommodate a forecast growth of 800 new students between September 2011 and September 2015.

40|$|This project investigates {{barriers}} to effective fulfilment of Occupational Health and Safety and Housing regulations by British Columbian farmers hiring seasonal agricultural workers. I survey {{the existing literature}} and conduct a survey among {{a small sample of}} BC farmers and find the major {{barriers to}} fulfilment of Occupational Health and Safety regulations are lack of information about the training resources, language barriers and the time constraint during harvesting season. Similarly, I find the high cost and <b>limited</b> availability <b>of</b> <b>accommodations</b> as the main obstacles to fulfilling housing requirements. The analysis of case studies in the United States shows how they have addressed similar obstacles for their large population of migrant farm workers. Using these findings, I propose policy alternatives that address Occupational Health and Safety and the housing needs of Seasonal Agricultural Workers in BC. After evaluating these alternatives based on a set of criteria, this study provides final recommendations...|$|R

Concave lenses have negative dioptric value and generally correct myopia (nearsightedness). Typical glasses for mild myopia will have a power of −1.00 to −3.00 dioptres, while over the counter reading glasses will be rated at +1.00 to +3.00 dioptres.

40|$|The {{increased}} rate in sea level rise and other predicted {{effects of climate}} change associated with global warming, will inevitably lead to geomorphic changes on the Roberts Bank tidal flats on the Fraser River delta of southwest British Columbia. A dyked landward edge <b>limits</b> the amount <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> space available for the tidal flats and marsh to adjust to higher sea levels. This lack of space combined with the training of the Fraser River, which has contributed to a shortage of sediment supply, will affect the morphologic changes of the ecologically important tidal flat. Current biosedimentological zonation maps and cross-shore profile data are used to identify and understand potential morphologic changes. Copyright ASCE 2006...|$|R
40|$|Focusing on the {{delivery}} of justice in Inuit communities in northern Quebec, Incorporating the Familiar investigates the complexities and contradictions <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal legal systems. Conflict between the two legal orders, Susan Drummond argues, is really more about incommensurability between underlying cultural codes. She uses legal pluralism as a springboard to reflect on wider questions of intercultural history, concepts of identity and belonging, and problems of communication across cultures and between men and women. Drummond explores a series of philosophic, ethnographic, and legal dilemmas produced by the interaction between legal cultures, setting up a dialogue between narrative and theory by interspersing accounts of her field experiences in Inuit communities with analytical chapters. In the first section she addresses problems of delivery of justice among Inuit communities and explores the cultural determinacy of understanding. In the second section she focuses {{on the problem of}} family violence and the complexities to which it gives rise in rendering justice in Inuit communities. In the third section she provides an ethnographic account of Nunavik 2 ̆ 7 s first sentencing circle, underlining her contention that juridical rules emerge from the habits and forms of a society. Exploring the quandaries of intercultural communication and contemplating how diverse legal sensibilities might be mutually recognized, Incorporating the Familiar evokes the possibilities and <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> intercultural <b>accommodation.</b> [URL]...|$|R
25|$|King Faisal {{seemed to}} hold the pluralist view, favouring <b>limited,</b> {{cautious}} <b>accommodation</b> <b>of</b> popular demands for inclusive reform, and made repeated attempts to broaden political representation, harking back to his temporarily successful national integration policy from 1965 to 1975. King Faisal acknowledged his country's religious and cultural diversity, which includes the predominantly Shia Ahsa in the east; the Asir in the southwest, with tribal affinities to Yemen, especially among the Ismaili tribes of Najran and Jizan; and the Kingdom of the Hejaz, with its capital Mecca. He included non-Wahhabi, cosmopolitan Sunni Hejazis from Mecca and Jeddah in the Saudi government.

40|$|Criminal justice {{decision-makers}} {{are routinely}} {{called upon to}} formulate and apply normative standards — including adjudication on criminal responsibility, assessments as to the availability of defences, and sentencing determinations. In polyethnic societies such as Australia, the terms in which the relevant standard should be conceived is sometimes challenged by defendants {{on the basis of}} their ethnic or religious identity. Such claims are commonly regarded as giving rise to a ‘clash’ — between the objective of valuing and respecting multiculturalism and pluralism, while adhering to ‘fundamental’ liberal principles regarding equality before the law (universality, uniformity and neutrality). This article examines a range of ‘diversity friendly’ theoretical perspectives with the aim of revealing whether it is possible to overcome the ‘equality’ hurdle and the associated demands for single and generally applicable normative standards. Drawing from the political philosophy of liberal multiculturalism, legal pluralism, critical race theory and whiteness studies, the theoretical <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> cultural diversity <b>accommodation</b> will be explored...|$|R

One study found the approach used by school administrators to address accommodations influences student perceptions <b>of</b> test <b>accommodations</b> (Rickey 2005). Rickey (2005) studied three different middle schools, interviewing a variety of stakeholders.

MethodsOcular accommodation was stimulated with 0. 5 D steps in target vergence spanning the full range <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> for each subject. Subjective monocular amplitude <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> was measured using two clinical methods, using negative lenses and with a custom Badal optometer. ResultsBoth subjective methods gave similar results. Results obtained from the Badal optometer where {{used to test the}} accuracy of the objective methods. All objective methods showed lower amplitude <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> that the subjective ones by an amount that varied from 0. 2 to 1. 1 D depending on the method.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Accommodation</b> and {{breakdown}} <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> {{are important}} elements of information processing in nerve fibers, as they determine how nerve fibers react to natural slowly changing stimuli or electrical stimulation. The aim {{of the present study}} was to elucidate the biophysical mechanism <b>of</b> breakdown <b>of</b> <b>accommodation,</b> which at present is unknown. Results A model of a space-clamped motor nerve fiber was developed. It was found that this new model could reproduce breakdown <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> when it included a low-threshold, rapidly activating, persistent sodium current. However, the phenomenon was not reproduced when the persistent sodium current did not have fast activation kinetics or a low activation threshold. Conclusion The present modeling study suggests that persistent, low-threshold, rapidly activating sodium currents have a key role in breakdown <b>of</b> <b>accommodation,</b> and that breakdown <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> can be used as a tool for studying persistent sodium current under normal and pathological conditions. </p...|$|R
