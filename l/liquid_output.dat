The energetic and environmental performance {{of this process}} is investigated {{as a function of the}} input solar ratio, the assumed carbon conversion in the gasification reactor, and, for various solar input strategies. It was found that solar input strategy has only a small effect on the performance of the solar hybridized BTL process. With the increase of solar ratio from 0 to 1, for an assumed carbon conversion of 73. 3 %, the overall efficiency and specific Fischer-Tropsch (FT) <b>liquids</b> <b>output</b> increase by 1. 7 % and 2. 6 %, respectively, while the specific CO 2 emission decreases by 12 %.

40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} solar hybridised coal-to-liquids {{is to produce}} {{transportation}} liquid fuels from the syngas obtained from gasification ofcarbonaceous feedstocks with the integration of concentrated solar thermal power (CSP). In the present study, a techno-economic evaluation of a coal-to-liquids processes integrated with a solar hybridised, oxygen blown, atmospheric pressure vortex-flow gasifier (SCTL) is {{compared with that of}} a reference, non-solar, pressurised entrained flow gasifier (CTL) based on the solar and coal resources in Australia. In comparison with conventional gasification systems, the proposed SCTL system reduces the input feedstock by 18 % while maintaining the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) <b>liquids</b> <b>output.</b> Furthermore, with the addition of CSP to the CTL plant, a reduction in mine-to-tank (MTT) CO 2 emissions by 26 % can be achieved. This {{is due to the fact}} that the heat required to meet the endothermic gasification reactions is supplied by CSP when the sun is available, thus more coal was converted to syngas subsequently higher FT liquids. To produce 1500 barrel per day of FT liquids,the total permanent investment cost for the SCTL plant was estimated to be around $ 467 -$ 493 million, depending on the solar site and the coal compared with the CTL plant of around $ 377 -$ 384 million if the plant was to be built in year 2020. The levelised cost of fuel (LCOF) for the CTL plants was found to be around $ 40 -$ 41 /GJLHV and $ 46 -$ 49 /GJLHV for the SCTL plants. The LCOF for the plants is very sensitive to the total permanent investment cost, load factor and cost of carbon capture and sequestration.

The unstable reservoir fluid is separated into crude oil and gas in a three stage gas oil separation plant. Peng Robinson Equation of State and successive substitution is used to model the separators. The <b>liquid</b> <b>output</b> for the third stage separators is stable crude oil and the crude oil is sold on the international market. The gas liberated in the separators is compressed by centrifugal compressors and injected into the reservoir. Several methods for modelling centrifugal compressors are discussed. The discussion concludes that Dimensionless Parameters is the best suited method for this case and this method is therefore used. The plant studied has three separation stages at decreasing pressure and the standard control method is to use fixed separator pressure. This is not optimal and brute force optimization is used to find the optimal pressure set-points. Adaptive pressure set-points will improve product separation and therefore increase the profit. The profit is calculated as the income from crude oil sale minus the energy cost. Using this new method, the optimum separator pressures for Snorre A are determined. As a result, the profit is increased with 0. 17, 0. 11 and 0. 07 present for three different inlet conditions. For one year this small increase in profit gives an extra two million dollars in income.

40|$|Fasting is an {{activity}} {{that has been done}} by people for long time. It is believed that fasting is good for health. During fasting people restrict food and water intake. How fasting makes body healthy and how body maintains the balance of energy and fluid during fasting are very interesting to learn. The objective of this review essay is to describe how the body maintain the balance of energy and fluid during fasting. During fasting, body lacks of food or energy intake, that means there is a relative lower blood glucose level. In this condition, the body produces hormones that increase the blood glucose level, like glucagons and epinephrine, that stimulate glicogenolysisis, lipolysis and gluconeogenesis, which maintain the blood glucose in the normal level. The processes above supply the glucose needed by the cells for metabolism. The lipolysis can reduce fat volume of the body, that is why fasting can reduce body weight and prevent the body from obesity and metabolic disorder. During fasting, the body also lacks of water intake, that means the body is relatively dehydration. In this condition the body produces hormons that reduce the urine output to minimize the <b>liquid</b> <b>output</b> from the body. They are antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from posterior hipophysis and aldosteron from kidney, that increase the natrium and water reabsorption from the tubulus of the kidney. The urine product restriction is supported by the vasoconstriction of the arthery that supplies blood to the kidney (arthery renalis). During fasting, the body produces high concentration and minimal volume of urine, that possibly the body to maintain liquid balance of the body, while the excretion of the toxic substances by the kidney still going on well. During fasting, the body do the physiological adaptations to maintain the energy and liquid balance. The processes to maintain the energy balance are glicogenolysis, lypolisis and gluconeogenesis, that are supported by glucagons and epinephrine. The process to maintain the liquid balance is the restriction of urine output, that is supported by ADH, aldosteron and the vasoconstriction of arthery renalis...|$|E

40|$|A new {{configuration}} of solar hybridized dual fluidized bed (DFB) gasification process is proposed with char separation {{for the production}} of Fischer–Tropsch (FT) liquid fuels from solid fuels of biomass and/or coal. The addition of carbon capture with sequestration and FT reactor tail-gas recycle configurations is also assessed. The studied FT liquid fuels production systems are simulated by using a pseudodynamic model incorporating a year long, hourly averaged solar insolation time-series. For the case with a solar multiple (i. e., the heliostat field area relative to that required to meet the demand of the DFB gasifier at the point of peak solar thermal output) of 2. 64 and bed material storage capacity of 16 h, the calculated annual solar share of the solar hybridized coal-to-liquids system can be increased from 12. 2 to 20. 3 % by the addition of the char separation for a char gasification conversion of 80 %. To achieve the well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions for FT liquid fuels parity with diesel derived from mineral crude oil, a calculated biomass fraction of 58 % is required for the nonsolar coal case, also with a char gasification conversion of 80 %. This fraction can be reduced to 30 % by carbon capture and sequestration and further reduced to 17 % by the integration of solar energy, based on a solar multiple of 2. 64 and bed material storage capacity of 16 h. This reduction is significant given that biomass is much more expensive than coal. However, because of the higher content of light hydrocarbons content in the syngas produced with the studied biomass gasification, the specific FT <b>liquids</b> <b>output</b> per unit feedstock of the system decreases with an increase in the biomass fraction. As the biomass fraction is increased from 0 to 100 %, this specific output is decreased from 59. 6 to 48. 3 % but can be increased to 71. 5 and 70. 9 %, respectively, by incorporating tail-gas recycle.
