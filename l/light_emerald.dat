50|$|Upon {{entering}} Emerald Coast, {{a tropical}} paradise created from {{the dream of}} those who enjoy the sun, the group finds out that Void's powers are changing the beach into ice. The group obtains the first precioustone after surfing down a tidal wave {{brought on by the}} ice. After the Precioustone is brought back to the Temple of <b>Light,</b> <b>Emerald</b> Coast is restored to its original state. The group is next teleported to another world containing the dream of freedom. The Fire Bird, a large airship, contains the true form of its world that is losing power. Once the group collects the next Precioustone, the Fire Bird is destroyed and Sonic, Amy, Tails and Knuckles flee to a balloon. With the dream to be free restored, the Fire Bird reveals its true form, a phoenix.|$|E

50|$|It is one {{of several}} caves worldwide, that is flooded with a {{brilliant}} blue or <b>emerald</b> <b>light.</b> The quality and nature of the color in each cave is determined by the unique lighting conditions in that particular cave. The grotto, which is located at the Amalfi Coast, is partly filled with sea water. The surface area of the water measures roughly 45 x 32 metres, with a cavern roof about 24 metres above water level. Formation of cave was caused by bradyseism - tectonic upheaval of cliffs, where cliffs fractured and cave was formed along the fissures. Now the cave has descended and sea water had entered it, partly flooding the stalagmites in it.|$|R

5000|$|... "Emerald Plaza’s {{hexagonal}} design {{allows for}} {{the maximum number of}} guestrooms and offices with views, as well as minimizes wasted space typical to rectangular buildings. Further more, this design utilizes angled window sills, which reflect ambient sunlight into the building, reducing <b>lighting</b> requirements. The <b>Emerald</b> Plaza was built in 1990 at a cost of $150,000,000. It consists of a steel frame structure with an exterior combination of granite stone panels and reflective glass set in a custom Kynar green aluminum window framing system. The structure itself is balanced on a 9-foot deep concrete block which acts like a floating device, allowing the building ebb and flow, mimicking the movement of water. This technique makes {{it one of the most}} stable structures in San Diego." ...|$|R

[...] On 24 March 1927, with her sister ship, USS William B. Preston, and Royal Navy <b>light</b> cruiser HMS <b>Emerald,</b> she helped to rescue foreigners from Nanjing. The three ships used their main batteries to lay down a barrage of shrapnel and high explosive on Socony Hill, driving back hostile Chinese forces and also halting sniping along the Nanjing Bund and a sortie by Kuomintang gunboats. This allowed refugees to retreat {{down the hill to}} the safety of U.S. and British warships. Noa also participated in the periodic fleet exercises which were intended to keep crew and equipment at peak efficiency.|$|R
25|$|When Winston Churchill formed his {{government}} in 1940 {{the war was}} going badly for the Allies. As a guarantee that the Empire could continue the fight if the UK was overrun, Churchill devised a plan to ship British wealth {{to the safety of}} Canada. Using their wartime powers the Churchill government confiscated the securities that the British people were forced to register {{at the beginning of the}} year and under the cover of secrecy moved them to the port of Greenock in Scotland. Then men sworn to silence loaded the wealth onto the Emerald-class <b>light</b> cruiser HMS <b>Emerald.</b> The ship departed on 24 June 1940 and with an escort of some destroyers sailed to Canada. Again another fierce storm almost ruined the operation when high seas forced the ships to slow their speed making them easy targets for any prowling U-Boats. When they finally reached Halifax, on 1 July 1940, the British treasure was transferred to trains and the gold sent to Ottawa while the securities were shipped to the Sun Life Building in Montreal.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to suggest a model that {{incorporates}} critical factors contributing to the success in new service development (NSD) projects in electronic government (e-government). Design/methodology/approach: After a brief introduction to e-government and NSD in respect to models for successful implementation, the authors justify and build on the existing literature that advocates the use of critical success factors (CSFs) to study the implementation of these projects. They suggest a model that incorporates the determinants of success or failure for a new service through a set of variables. Findings: This paper proposes a framework, which is believed to help with the empirical research of CSF in NSD. The suggested framework attempts to bring experience in leadership and coordination of work theory and practice together by synthesising the existing literature with real-life experience. Research limitations/implications: The paper contributes to the e-government implementation literature in terms of suggesting a model that takes under consideration important CSF for implementing NSD. Practical implications: The projects a number of implications for public sector scholars as well as administrators. A vast amount of taxpayer money can be saved if decision makers can promptly identify potential waste of funds in prone-to-failure projects. Originality/value: The research aims at providing a better understanding of the underlying factors and dimensions that describe NSD in e-government through the suggestion of a model that takes under consideration important CSF for implementing NSD. Therefore, it expands the scope of NSD research in e-government context, stating the need for more research to be conducted regarding the NSD in e-government using CSF. By identifying the potential success or failure of future projects a number of implications for public sector scholars as well as administrators comes to <b>light.</b> © <b>Emerald</b> Group Publishing Limited...|$|R

40|$|In {{spite of}} the great amount of emerald {{deposits}} throughout the world, the priorities in quality and volume of extracted rough material are the sites of Colombia (Muzo and Chivor emerald belts). This sites are know even before the Spanish conquistadores. Emeralds were extracted from Somondoco mine (today Chivor) since 1537 and from Muzo in 1567. Contrariwise {{to the majority of}} the emerald deposits of the world, which are associated with granitic rocks, the Colombian emerald deposits are associated with hydrofracturing (the main factor controlling emerald mineralization) and hydrothermal fluids, rich in beryl, chrome and vanadium, induced by a tectonic inversion of the deep Mesozoic backarc basin, which is also responsible {{of the majority of the}} petroleum systems of the foredeep and foldbelt areas (maturation of the source-rocks andcreation of structural traps). The host rocks of the emeralds are carbonaceous calsiltites (calcareous schists) rich in organic matter of Lower Cretaceous age, which are cut by calcite veins, which, often, contain emeralds, particularly when they are folded. Indeed, since long time (Cheilletz, A. and Giulliani, G., 1996) suggested a two-stage model for the formation of the Colombian emeralds : (i) Stage I is characterized by décollement planes (early compressional tectonic regime) within the carbonaceous calsiltites, hydrothermal fluid infiltration and wall-rock metasomatic alteration; (ii) Stage II (late tectonic regime) deforms the previous veins by thrust-related folds (development of stratiform and hydraulic breccia), which are synchronous of the emerald mineralization. The resulting tectonic structures are complex fold patterns characterized by propagation anticlines with emerald veins and emerald hydraulic breccia in the apexes, as in Quipama, Tendenquema and Chivor mines. Otherwise stated, since all emerald exploitations are, presently underground, exhaustive geological and particularly structural studies are required to reduce the probability of disappointments. The color of <b>emeralds</b> is from <b>light</b> green to thick green with obvious pleochroism. They appears with different colors when observed at different angles, especially with polarized <b>light.</b> The <b>emeralds</b> from Coscuez deposits have a homogeneous intensive color and bluish tone. At Muzo deposit, the emeralds have middle or dark green color with yellowish tone. At the Chivor deposits, the emeralds have less intensive green color with slight bluish tone. The typical inclusions are albite and pyrite, as well as long bubbles with three phase-inclusions according the zones of growth and along the crystal shapes...|$|R
5000|$|Hatchlings have {{translucent}} green scales, which harden {{and take}} on many shades of green as they age. These scales are scintillating in the <b>light,</b> giving an <b>emerald</b> dragon's hide the appearance of being in constant motion. A desire for privacy runs through the emerald clans, {{going so far as}} to determine where the dragon lords and their spawn establish lairs. In the southern islands, emerald dragons built their domains around the inactive volcano range that stretches across the tropical isles. Only their most trusted vassals are permitted to serve them within the main lairs. The others tend to duties throughout the rest of the domain. The primary lairs consist of traps and alarms designed to warn the dragon of visitor and other threats. Emerald dragons prefer to quietly observe intruders and rarely emerge from hiding. If parlay is called for, they send their kindred or chief vassals to handle such duties while they watch, hidden, from cover. When forced into combat, emerald dragons prefer to attack by ambush, using stealth and surprise attacks to quickly disable their enemies. If the threat prove to be too great to handle, an emerald dragon will not hesitate to retreat. However, it will plan revenge, and its patience can last for centuries if need be. Emerald dragons have no compunctions about what they eat. They prefer lizards and giants, but they will eat anything in a pinch. Of all the other type of dragonkind, emerald dragons get along best with the sapphire dragons, often controlling parallel domains (emerald dragons taking the surface, sapphire dragon the subterranean areas below). They fear the red dragon clans because of their well-known greed, and they are usually in open conflict with the fire giants from beyond the Burning Sea. Emeralds like the security and protection offered by a trusted partner and will take a single mate for a long time.|$|R
