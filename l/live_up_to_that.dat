500|$|In July 2015, Bad Boy Entertainment artist Gizzle {{told the}} press that she is collaborating with Combs on what she {{describes}} as his last album, titled No Way Out 2, a sequel to his 1997 debut. She describes the music as unique: [...] "The mindset is to just be classic and to be epic. And to really <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>that...</b> we know it's a tall order, but we welcome the challenge." [...] In April 2016, Combs announced that after this last album and tour, he plans to retire from the music industry to focus on acting.|$|E
500|$|The first essay, [...] "On Face-work", {{discusses}} {{the concept of}} face, which is the positive self-image that an individual holds when interacting with others. Goffman believes that face [...] "as a sociological construct of interaction, is neither inherent in nor a permanent aspect of the person". Once an individual offers a positive self-image of him or herself to others, that individual feels a need to maintain and <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> image. Inconsistency in how a person projects him or herself in society risks embarrassment and discrediting. Therefore, people remain guarded, {{to ensure that they}} do not show themselves to others in an unfavorable light.|$|E
500|$|In {{regards to}} the final scene of the episode with Daenerys Targaryen riding Drogon and emboldening her newly {{acquired}} khalasar, Benioff stated in the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] featurette that the scene {{is a reflection of}} the speech that Khal Drogo gave before his death, with Benioff saying [...] "One of our favorite moments from season one was watching Khal Drogo deliver a speech to his gathered khalasar, that speech clearly lingered in Daenerys's mind, and she's echoing almost the exact same language when she's talking to the Dothraki now. She's basically telling them the promise that one of the great Khals had made years before and saying now is the time to <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> promise and fulfill it." ...|$|E

5000|$|Mikael Wood {{from the}} Los Angeles Times gave the album a mixed review, {{saying that it}} [...] "darts {{somewhat}} haphazardly from sleek dance-pop tunes ... to schmaltzy slow jams" [...] but also that [...] "it also feels like an honest showcase of the singer's voice ... its strength <b>lives</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of her collaborators." ...|$|R
500|$|Descending to {{the actual}} site made both Cameron and crew want [...] "to <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> level of reality.... But there was another level of {{reaction}} coming away from the real wreck, which was that it wasn't just a story, it wasn't just a drama," [...] he said. [...] "It was an event that happened to real people who really died. Working around the wreck for so much time, you get such {{a strong sense of}} the profound sadness and injustice of it, and the message of it." [...] Cameron stated, [...] "You think, 'There probably aren't going to be many filmmakers who go to Titanic. There may never be another one – maybe a documentarian." [...] Due to this, he felt [...] "a great mantle of responsibility to convey the emotional message of it – to do that part of it right, too".|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{the double}} burden is more evolved with the times {{concerning}} both sexes and their newfound roles. The role of a provider and caregiver is sometimes expected of women, but as more women enter the workforce, an 'independent' ideology seems to take effect and forces some women to decide between a career and family. Some may choose strictly one or the other, others may choose to carry the burden of both lifestyles. Some [...] "modern men tend {{to believe in the}} principle of equal sharing of domestic labor, but fail to actually <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> belief." [...] The constant tug of war regarding one's time and where it could, should but will be spent creates a new speed bump that is a little bit higher than the previous ones. Modern times illuminate the dilemma that many dual-income couples face when trying to reconcile unpaid domestic work and paid employment. The burden of encompassing both ideologies plays a toll on both sexes in today's societies.|$|E
500|$|Filitti's first {{important}} postings {{were received}} from the Conservative cabinet of P. P. Carp, wherein Titu Maiorescu held the Foreign Affairs portfolio. After 1910, Maiorescu appointed Filitti head of the Ministry's Political Section in Bucharest, and then granted him supervision of the Consular and Litigation sections. Filitti was also sent on regular missions to France, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, Serbia and Italy. The missions allowed Filitti to expand his activity as a historiographer and archivist. The main stimulus of this activity was, according to Filitti's son Manole, a sense of filial duty: [...] "since destiny wished for his parents to have such assets as {{would allow him to}} study in Paris for a couple of years, [...] felt compelled to repay them by publishing works which would <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> degree of education." [...] According to historian Lucian Boia, although [...] "non-academic", Filitti's work has earned deserved praise from within the scholarly community. Georgeta Penelea-Filitti argues that I. C. Filitti's work, indicative of his personality, covers an impressively [...] "large horizon." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Paradise Theatre's demise came in 1956, when Balaban and Katz {{closed the}} theater, {{demolished}} {{the building and}} sold the land to be developed as a supermarket.

50|$|Virginia Tech's {{second game}} of the season came against the Football Championship Subdivision (formerly Division I-AA) Furman Paladins at Virginia Tech's home stadium, Lane Stadium, in Blacksburg, Virginia.

500|$|... "Mrs. California" [...] {{received}} mixed {{responses from}} critics. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt said the episode had {{the possibility of}} being a great episode of The Office, but that it did not <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> possibility. He suggested that the writers could tell jokes, but could not successfully [...] "break a story anymore". He also called the subplot a mixed bag for featuring Dwight as a caricature of his former self, but complimented the character development for Darryl which started in [...] "Lotto". He gave the episodes a C+. Hannah Lawrence of Hollywood.com called the episode a large improvement over [...] "Gettysburg" [...] and also called it possibly her [...] "favorite episode of the season so far". Chris Plante of New York called Robert California the worst part of The Office and said that he kept Andy from being more of a lead character for the series. TV Guide writer Bruce Fretts criticized the episode for under using guest star Maura Tierney. He also said that the episode suffered without former series star Steve Carell to serve as the comic foil. IGN writer Cindy White said the episode did not feel like The Office and called it [...] "the exact opposite". Despite this, she went on to compliment Susan asking Andy on a date and the pairing of Darryl and Val as a couple, saying that the latter had possibilities. She ultimately gave the episode a 7.5/10. Joseph Kratzer from What Culture? gave the episode three out of five stars and wrote, [...] "I'm going {{to go out on a}} bit of a limb here and say that while 'Mrs. California' was of course not a return to form for The Office, it was a good example of how the series might define itself in this new Michael-less era." [...] M. Giant of Television without Pity gave the episode a B+. [...] After viewing [...] "Mrs. California," [...] Washington Post writer Hank Stuever named The Office one of the ten best TV shows of 2011 and said that the episode proved the series could still deliver cringe humor without Carell. Multiple critics complimented the cold open to the episode.|$|E

5000|$|Conversely, Ivan Hewett of The Daily Telegraph {{was more}} {{critical}} of the work, remarking, [...] "The composer's own programme note promised a rich imaginative world, embracing the Swiss schizophrenic artist Adolf Wölfi, Tibetan temple music, and black dancers at an imagined dance hall in 1930s New York (thus the concerto's title, At the Royal Majestic). Here and there, the sound-world <b>lived</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> promise, but long before the end the piece became lost in its own labyrinth." ...|$|R

Club gave the episode an A- and said [...] "I thought this was a strong episode of The Simpsons. I laughed frequently throughout, I thought both of the major storylines mostly made sense and concluded well, and I enjoyed some of the ways the episode turned satire on its ear. I particularly liked the idea of Lisa conforming by becoming a brunette after everyone made fun of her for being a blonde. Dumb blonde jokes are as old as time itself, but the way the episode turned the whole thing into a sly parody of diversity and conformity was winning." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{city walls}} were repaired; Minucius {{was put in}} charge of {{preparing}} a [...] "reception committee" [...] by raising 2 Roman and 2 allied legions and attached cavalry units to defend the city in nearby Tibur. The unwalled towns in Latium were ordered to be abandoned, and their inhabitants were moved into walled towns. Certain bridges were torn down to deny the Carthaginians easy passage through Latium. Once it was clear that Hannibal was not marching towards Rome, Fabius ordered the army of Servilius into Latium. Fabius left Rome, met and took over command of the army of Servilius near Narnia, or a few miles south at Ocriculum, then joined the army of Minucius at Tibur and marched along the via Appia into Apulia. Servilus was sent to command the Roman fleet at Ostia with the rank of proconsul. With the Roman army concentrated, Fabius needed to implement the next phase of his plans: how to defeat the Carthaginian army. Fabius in his childhood had been named ovicula (Little Sheep) for his mildness and willingness to follow others about, and in the coming months his activities gave the impression that he was doing his utmost to <b>live</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> nickname.|$|E
