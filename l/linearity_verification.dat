5000|$|A typical OPM {{measures}} accurately under most conditions {{from about}} 0 dBm (1 milli Watt) to about -50 dBm (10 nano Watt), although the display range may be larger. Above 0 dBm is considered [...] "high power", and specially adapted units may {{measure up to}} nearly + 30 dBm ( [...] 1 Watt). Below -50 dBm is [...] "low power", and specially adapted units may measure as low as -110 dBm. Irrespective of power meter specifications, testing below about -50 dBm tends {{to be sensitive to}} stray ambient light leaking into fibers or connectors. So when testing at [...] "low power", some sort of test range / <b>linearity</b> <b>verification</b> (easily done with attenuators) is advisable. At low power levels, optical signal measurements tend to become noisy, so meters may become very slow due to use of a significant amount of signal averaging.|$|E
40|$|A major {{limitation}} of the linearity of Current Steering (CS) RF-DACs is the large output voltage swing (typically 1 Vpp), which couples to sensitive internal nodes and thereby causes non-linear distortion. This paper proposes a novel approach for the linearization of the CS RF-DAC. An output transformer decouples the output from the circuit core and attenuates the voltage swing seen by the RF-DAC current cells. A lumped element model of a transformer is used in calculations and simulations to analyze {{the performance of the}} transformer in the Mixing-DAC application, and to select optimal design parameters for high <b>linearity.</b> <b>Verification</b> with a simulation model of an RF-DAC shows that the output related non-linearity (IMD 3) of the CS RF-DAC improves with about 14 dB when the proposed transformer parameters are use...|$|E
40|$|The {{linearity}} of {{the short}} circuit current (Isc) of CPV cells over several order of magnitude of irradiance is frequently assumed. Hence, in a self-reference calibration method, the ratio of Isc at concentration to its value at 1 sun is frequently used to estimate the concentration ratio. However, this assumption {{may not be in}} all cases strictly true, and is not appropriate for calibration purposes. A method of CPV cell calibration has been described previously [1], employing standard reference cells combined with neutral density (ND) filters to enable simultaneous cell and irradiance measurement up to high intensity levels. The method presented, while shown to be satisfactory in principle, had the limitation that the reference cells used have been verified to be linear over only approximately one order of magnitude. This meant that more than one ND filter has to be used to cover a suitably large range of intensities, and indeed results did suggest that at the point of change over some systematic error was introduced. The reference cell and ND filter combination used also proved bulky leading to increased uncertainty in the irradiance levels at the device compared to the reference. In this paper we present an improvement to the measurement setup, employing a new reference device, and a new set of ND filters. Results of <b>linearity</b> <b>verification</b> and measurements on CPV cells are also presented. JRC. F. 7 -Renewable Energy (Ispra...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{and compares}} two popular methods {{to widen the}} modulation bandwidth of a phase-locked loop, i. e., the pre-emphasis and the two-point injection technique. The analysis reveals that both architectures have the same sensitivity to gain errors and nonlinearity in the loop, though, compared with the pre-emphasis, the two-point injection scheme features less sources of error and {{does not require a}} phase detector with wide range and tight <b>linearity</b> requirements. The <b>verification</b> of the analysis as well as the comparison of the two modulation techniques is carried out on an accurate time-domain model of a 60 -GHz digital phase-locked loop, taken as a case study and used to generate wideband chirp signals for a radar system...|$|R
30|$|A radio-HPLC {{system is}} {{typically}} {{composed of a}} pump, which drives the eluent through the various detectors and columns, the detectors themselves, {{one of which is}} always a radioactivity detector, while the others are needed to identify and quantify non-radioactive species, and their selection is depending on the intended application. The most frequently used detectors are UV detectors, but conductivity or electrochemical (or others) detectors are also used for specific applications. These detectors will be hereinafter defined as “mass detectors”. Injection of the sample may be performed manually or automatically, by means of an autosampler. Chromatographic columns may be kept at room temperature or heated, by means of a column oven. Finally, most of the HPLC systems currently available are controlled via a suitable software, which is also used to acquire and process signals coming from detectors. From a validation perspective, HPLC may be considered as a sum of different components that may be tested individually. Thus, OQ and PQ test should be designed specifically for e.g. UV detectors, as well as for radiochemical detectors, while control and acquisition software may be evaluated as a whole. OQ on radiochemical detectors may include a <b>linearity</b> <b>verification</b> of the voltage output, in response to decreasing level of radioactivity. A sample of the intended radionuclide/radiopharmaceutical is suitable for this purpose. OQ test on UV detectors usually include: i) test on wavelength accuracy, using a suitable known reference standard; ii) noise and drift test, which can be performed running flow for a suitable time (e.g. 60  min) and recording and allowing software to record the above parameters (some instruments may already have software routines designed to run the tests); iii) a verification of absorbance accuracy using reference standard, which can be easily purchased from commercial supplier, iv) test on software user access and related privileges. Similarly, other “mass detectors” such as conductivity detectors might be OQ checked for linearity and reproducibility using standard ionic solution (e.g. chlorides, sulphates, etc.). HPLC pump may be tested for accuracy and precision by collecting and weighing, using a calibrated analytical balance, a statistically significant number of samples (e.g. 10 samples, collected at a flowrate of 1  ml/min). Column oven, if present, should be checked for its capability to maintain the selected temperature, by setting a range and measuring, using a calibrated thermometer, a range of temperatures. Similarly, accuracy, precision and linearity test might be performed on the autosampler, with the aim to verify their capability to reliably inject samples of the desired volumes. Irrespective of the way the samples are injected (manual or automated), the injection system needs to be cleaned between injections: carry-over is another typical OQ test, aimed to prove the efficacy of the cleaning procedure. Carry-over should be tested by repeatedly analysing samples of mobile phase following the injection of samples containing significant amounts of the intended analytes; to verify carry-over of UV or other “mass detectors”, samples should be taken from the higher concentration solution used in linearity test; for radiation protection purposes, carry-over tests on radiochemicals should be avoided, and the results obtained with test on mass detectors should be considered as sufficient to demonstrate the cleaning efficacy.|$|E
