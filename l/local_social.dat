He maintained membership in <b>local</b> <b>social</b> clubs, and regularly sent a local doctor boxes of autographed baseballs, with the town's mayor using some for United Way fundraising. Musial also gave free meals at the restaurant he owned in St. Louis to any customers who presented valid ID proving they were Donora residents.|$|E

5|$|Often feminist economists use country-level {{or smaller}} case studies focused on {{developing}} and often understudied countries or populations. For example, Michael Kevane and Leslie C. Gray examine how gendered social norms {{are central to}} understanding agricultural activities in Burkina Faso. Cristina Carrasco and Arantxa Rodriquez examine the care economy in Spain to suggest that women's entrance into the labor market requires more equitable caregiving responsibilities. Such studies show the importance of <b>local</b> <b>social</b> norms, government policies and cultural situations. Feminist economists see such variation as a crucial factor {{to be included in}} economics.|$|E

25|$|Ethnographers {{concerned}} with the validity of activists' impressions studied a federal anti-trafficking task force {{in a city that}} had been identified as a hub for domestic minor sex trafficking. In comparing local sex markets with the understandings of <b>local</b> <b>social</b> service providers, law enforcement officials, and anti-trafficking activists participating in the task force they found that many of the claims of widespread trafficking activity were either exaggerations or misinterpretations of anecdotal evidence; thus calling into question activists' ability to understand the context of what they were seeing.|$|E

25|$|Brown was an {{unsuccessful}} candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii in 1966, {{and served in}} the Hawaii State Senate 1968 to 1974. Politically, Brown was influential on environmental and land development issues, and {{on the role of}} tourism in relationship to <b>local</b> <b>social</b> and cultural contexts. Brown managed the passage of long-term environmental protection policies, and advocated for opportunities through which the hotel industry might support the preservation of Hawaiian culture and historic sites. Brown’s position on tourism in Hawaii, made public at the 1984 Governor’s Tourism Conference, represents a key statement for the role of tourism in the state.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the priesthood}} in the Episcopal Church was {{restricted}} to men only, as was true of most other Christian denominations prior to the mid-20th century and still true for some. Objections to {{the ordination of women}} have been different {{from time to time and}} place to place. Some believe that it is fundamentally impossible for a woman to be validly ordained, while others believe it is possible but inappropriate. Considerations cited include <b>local</b> <b>social</b> conditions, ecumenical implications, or the symbolic character of the priesthood, an ancient tradition including an all male priesthood, as well as certain biblical texts.|$|E
25|$|Lewis Hoad {{was born}} on 23 November 1934, in the working-class Sydney inner suburb of Glebe, the eldest of three sons of tramway {{electrician}} Alan Hoad and his wife Ailsa Lyle.

As a young child he would wake up at 5 a.m. and hit tennis balls against a wall and garage door until the neighbours complained and {{he was allowed to}} practice on the courts of the Hereford Tennis Club behind the house. At age 10 he competed in the seaside tournament at Manly in the under 16 category.|$|E

25|$|This {{partnership}} with the community was in line with Sir Stamford Raffles' vision of a thriving colony largely self-regulated by <b>local</b> <b>social</b> structures, with the British masters administrating it via indirect rule. The large influx of migrants from China, however, began to test this system when the hands-off approach by the British allowed secret societies in Singapore to thrive. Although originally formed with legal intentions of community bonding {{and the provision of}} assistance to fellow migrants, these societies gradually became influential, competitive, and increasingly engaged in illegal activity including monetary extortion from the masses, the operation of gambling dens, and the smuggling of illegal goods on top of more legal commercial operations to meet their financial needs.|$|E
25|$|Douglas Alexander Warner III {{was born}} on June 9, 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio as the elder son to Douglas Alexander Warner Jr. and Eleanor (Wright) W. Warner. He has a brother, Gordon, and a sister, Marjorie. Warner came from money, {{growing up in the}} high-toned suburb of Indian Hill in a family with <b>local</b> <b>social</b> standing. For example, Warner's father served as a trustee of the Cincinnati Music Hall Association and Art Museum and chaired the United Appeal one year. Warner's {{grandfather}} (and namesake) ran his own insurance firm and was active in local golfing circles. Grandmother Warner was the daughter of a wealthy Cincinnati entrepreneur named J. Stacey Hill, who was the president of a then-prominent thousand-room Cincinnati hotel named Hotel Gibson.|$|E
25|$|The {{moment when}} Argentine rock {{began as a}} {{distinct}} musical style {{can be traced to}} the mid-1960s, when several garage groups and aspiring musicians began composing songs and lyrics that related to <b>local</b> <b>social</b> and musical themes. Rock and roll itself, however, began in Argentina almost a decade before. During that time until the rise of Argentine rock, local groups recycled the hits of English-language rock & roll. Since then, Argentine rock started a continued and uninterrupted evolution through the 1970s and into the 1980s, when it turned into an international genre. It is widely considered one of the most prolific and successful forms of Rock en Español, and one of the most important non-English language forms of rock music in the world.|$|E

25|$|Following its independence, the Philippines {{has seen}} both small and {{large-scale}} immigration into the country, mostly involving American, European, Chinese and Japanese peoples. After World War II, South Asians continued to migrate into the islands, {{most of which}} assimilated and avoided the <b>local</b> <b>social</b> stigma instilled by the early Spaniards against them by keeping a low profile and/or by trying to pass as Spanish mestizos. This was also true for the Arab and Chinese immigrants, {{many of whom are}} also post WWII arrivals. More recent migrations into the country by Koreans, Persians, Brazilians, and other Southeast Asians have contributed to the enrichment of the country's ethnic landscape, language and culture. Centuries of migration, diaspora, assimilation, and cultural diversity made most Filipinos accepting of interracial marriage and multiculturalism.|$|E
25|$|Reverend Robert Alfred Humble BA (1864–1929) was an Anglican priest, born in Heathery Cleugh, Weardale, Durham, England. His {{father was}} Reverend Emerson Humble (1837–1901). His career was marked with much {{pastoral}} work, including organising local fundraising events and meals for the elderly. He {{contributed to the}} work of committees, and joined in <b>local</b> <b>social</b> events, being a member of his church's cricket team. It is in this context of sociability and regular work among his congregation that the events surrounding the delayed discovery of his death, mentioned in several newspapers, remain a puzzle. Having suffered a seizure, he apparently lay openly on a flower bed in his vicarage garden on a dark February night, while his congregation spent eleven hours searching for him on the adjacent moorland. He was vicar St Mark's 1897–1901.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the income}} limit for {{allowances}} varied {{according to the}} position of the child in the family and the number of dependent children, these ceilings were made more favourable in cases where both parents were working or where a single parent was in charge and were linked to changes in wage levels. Those taking parental leave to care for three or more children (provided that they fulfilled the rules for eligibility) also received certain benefits in kind, such as a non-taxable, non-means-tested benefit and priority on vocational training courses. A new boost was also given to research into family problems including an interest in the effects of changing family structures, of women’s employment and the impact of <b>local</b> <b>social</b> policies on family life. In addition, while a law on equal opportunities in employment was passed in July 1983 which prohibited all forms of unequal treatment regardless of the circumstances, together with providing for positive action plans to be established in major companies. In January 1984, a decree was made granting state aid to companies which implemented equality plans for staff. That same year, a law was passed that gave the regional Caissess des Allocations Familiales the task of collecting unpaid alimony, initially for lone parents and subsequently for remarried or cohabiting mothers.|$|E
