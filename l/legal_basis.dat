The Board of Pardons denied his application in October 1897. A second application was rejected in early 1899.|$|E

The Defenders opposed any pupil assignment plan as too moderate a response. Accommodating this extremist sentiment, the pupil assignment plan approved at the July 2 meeting was fairly weak. After the meeting, Gray independently asked Mays to draft a stronger pupil assignment proposal.|$|E

Lithuania, breaking away from the Soviet Union, stressed that it was simply re-establishing the independent state that existed between the world wars and that the Act never lost its legal power.|$|E

40|$|Requiring {{taxes to}} be paid in {{domestic}} money provides a <b>legal</b> tender <b>basis</b> for money demand and hence {{to the development of}} a financial system. In emerging markets, the level of taxation is a positive factor boosting financial development. At higher tax rates, however, taxation provides an incentive to reduce money demand and reduces the size of the financial sector. There is also evidence of re-switching in high-tax developed countries, where financial deepening increases with the tax rate. Such financial deepening represents a form of capital market repression, not unlike the growth-depressing effects of financial repression in many poor countries. ...|$|R
