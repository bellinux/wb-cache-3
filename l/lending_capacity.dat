If bank lending takes place under a weak corporate governance mechanism and is fraught with agency problems and ineffective bank monitoring, then an equilibrium emerges in which loan supply is strategically restricted. In this equilibrium, the loan restriction, the "under-lending" strategy, provides an advantage to one bank by increasing its market share and sustaining monopoly interest rates. The bank's incentives for doing so increase under conditions of increased volatility of <b>lending</b> <b>capacities</b> of banks, more severe borrower-side moral hazard, and lower returns on the investment projects.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimal design of retention in securitisation, {{in order to}} maximize welfare of screening per unit of retention, assuming that screening is costly and that the bank intends to securitise its loans. In contrast to the focus of previous literature on tranche retention, we deviate from the constitutional mechanisms of tranche retention to present a pareto-optimal method of tranche retention. Unlike the current ad-hoc-regulations, we derive the optimal design of retention from a utility maximization problem. We show that the level of retention per tranche should be dependent on the rate of credit default, i. e. the higher the rate of default, the higher the optimal rate of retention required to provide an incentive to screen carefully. From this approach, it follows that the rate of retention per tranche should be higher, the higher the position within the ranking order of subordination. Accordingly, the efficiency of tranche retention can be enhanced, reducing the level of retention required to maintain a given level of screening-effort. This retention design entails a recovery of the bank’s equity capital, thereby increasing liquidity and <b>lending</b> <b>capacities...</b>|$|R
40|$|The author {{argues that}} a policy of {{devaluation}} imposed on African economies in compliance with real exchange rate rules contradicts the inflation objectives of fiscal stabilisation because by devaluing a currency at every instance of inflation, it implies that the exchange rate is indexed to the domestic price level via the balance of payments and money supply. Given that one characteristic of African economies is that government is the largest consumer of foreign exchange, {{in the context of}} debt service payments, exchange rate depreciation magnifies the public sector net cash requirement and leads to a faster rate of monetary growth, thus resulting in further cyclic inflation. The author also argues that the other effect of devaluation is also to compromise bank balance sheets and lead to contractions in bank <b>lending</b> <b>capacities,</b> which also affect the real economy. This is on account of the fact that African banks hold open speculative positions in foreign exchange, which increase vulnerability of the entire financial system. The author supports the effectiveness of devaluation in changing the vector of relative prices via the price mechanism and therefore operating as an expenditure-switching device, but the fact that it also serves as a ‘conveyor belt’ transmitting costs into production structures and driving inflation quicker than the acclaimed price improvements undermines such merits. devaluation, inflation, stagnation, africa, imf...|$|R
