The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) estimate that AIDS has killed more than 25million people since it was first recognised on 5 June 1981, {{making it one of the}} most destructive epidemics in recorded history.

5|$|The show {{revolves}} around the adventures of the Griffin family, consisting of father Peter Griffin, a bumbling yet well-intentioned blue-collar worker; Lois, a stay-at-home mother and piano teacher {{who is a member}} of the wealthy Pewterschmidt family; Meg, their often-bullied teenage daughter who is also constantly ridiculed and ignored by the family; Chris, their awkward teenage son, who is overweight, unintelligent and a younger version of his father in many respects; and Stewie, their diabolical infant son of ambiguous sexual orientation who has adult mannerisms and uses stereotypical archvillain phrases. <b>Living</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> family is their witty, smoking, martini-swilling, sarcastic, English-speaking anthropomorphic dog Brian, though he is still considered a pet in many respects.|$|E

5|$|Timberlake's primary {{legacy is}} the journal he kept while <b>living</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Cherokee. The volume was {{published}} in 1765, likely following Timberlake's death in September of that year. The journal is of importance both as an ethnological study, as it contains detailed descriptions of various facets of Cherokee society, and as a historical account, as it gives insight into Cherokee political decision-making and the tribe's early reactions to the encroaching European colonists.|$|E

There Simon met his future wife, Cyla Müller, who he would marry in 1936. Hillel fell and broke his back in 1923 and died the following year. Rosa remarried in 1926 and moved to Dolyna with her new husband, Isack Halperin, who owned a tile factory there. Wiesenthal remained in Buczacz, <b>living</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Müller family, until he graduated from high school—on his second attempt—in 1928.|$|E

5|$|Edgar Poe {{first met}} his cousin Virginia in August 1829, {{four months after}} his {{discharge}} from the Army. She was seven at the time. In 1832, the family – made up of Elizabeth, Maria, Virginia, and Virginia's brother Henry – {{was able to use}} Elizabeth's pension to rent a home at what was then 3 North Amity Street in Baltimore. Poe's older brother William Henry Leonard Poe, who had been <b>living</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> family, had recently died on August 1, 1831. Poe joined the household in 1833 and was soon smitten by a neighbor named Mary Devereaux. The young Virginia served as a messenger between the two, at one point retrieving a lock of Devereaux's hair to give to Poe. Elizabeth Cairnes Poe died on July 7, 1835, effectively ending the family's income and making their financial situation even more difficult. Henry died around this time, sometime before 1836, leaving Virginia as Maria Clemm's only surviving child.|$|E
5|$|Florentine {{court records}} of 1476 show that Leonardo {{and three other}} young men were charged with sodomy but acquitted; {{homosexual}} acts were illegal in Renaissance Florence. From that date until 1478 {{there is no record}} of his work or even of his whereabouts. In 1478, he left Verrocchio's studio and was no longer a resident at his father's house. One writer, called the Anonimo Gaddiano, claims that in 1480 Leonardo was <b>living</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Medici and working in the Garden of the Piazza San Marco in Florence, a Neo-Platonic academy of artists, poets and philosophers that the Medici had established. In January 1478, he received an independent commission to paint an altarpiece for the Chapel of St. Bernard in the Palazzo Vecchio; in March 1481, he received a second independent commission for The Adoration of the Magi for the monks of San Donato a Scopeto. Neither commission was completed, the second being interrupted when Leonardo went to Milan.|$|E
5|$|Infant {{mortality}} rates are high, and life expectancy at birth is 50.03years. Abortion is illegal in Malawi. The Penal Code punishes women who seek illegal or clinical abortion with 14 years and 7 years in prison. There {{is a high}} adult prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS, with an estimated 980,000adults (or 9.1% of the population) <b>living</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> disease in 2015. There are approximately 27,000deaths each year from HIV/AIDS, and over half a million children orphaned because of the disease (2015). Approximately 250new people are infected each day, and at least 70% of Malawi's hospital beds are occupied by HIV/AIDS patients. The high rate of infection has resulted in an estimated 5.8% of the farm labor force dying of the disease. The government spends over $120,000 each year on funerals for civil servants who die of the disease. In 2006, international superstar Madonna started Raising Malawi, a foundation that helps AIDS orphans in Malawi, and also financed a documentary about the hardships experienced by Malawian orphans, called I Am Because We Are. Raising Malawi also works with the Millennium Villages Project to improve education, health care, infrastructure and agriculture in Malawi.|$|E

5|$|The Sunda slow loris is nocturnal and arboreal, {{typically}} {{occurring in}} evergreen forests. It prefers rainforests with continuous dense canopies {{and has an}} extremely low metabolic rate compared to other mammals of its size. Its diet consists of sap, floral nectar, fruit and arthropods. It will feed on exudates such as gum and sap by licking wounds in trees. The species is generally solitary; one study showed only 8% of its active time was spent near other individuals. Social behavior makes up a very {{small part of the}} activity budget, though it has monogamous mating system with the offspring <b>living</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> parents. It sleeps during the day, rolled up in a ball in hidden parts of trees above the ground, often on branches, twigs, palm fronds, or lianas. The species is polyoestrous, usually giving birth to a single offspring after a gestation period of 192 days. The young disperses between 16 and 27 months, generally when it is sexually mature.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} in the mansion of the fictional Edison family: Dr. Fred, a mad scientist; Nurse Edna, his wife; and their son Weird Ed. <b>Living</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Edisons are two large, disembodied tentacles, one purple and the other green. The intro {{sequence}} shows that a sentient meteor crashed near the mansion twenty years earlier; it brainwashed the Edisons and directed Dr. Fred to obtain human brains for use in experiments. The game begins as Dave Miller prepares to enter the mansion to rescue his girlfriend, Sandy Pantz, who was kidnapped by Dr. Fred. With the exception of the green tentacle, the mansion's inhabitants are hostile, and will throw the player characters into the dungeon—or, in some situations, kill them—if they see them. When a character dies, the player must choose a replacement from the unselected characters; and the game ends if all characters are killed. Maniac Mansion has five possible endings, based on which characters are chosen, which survive, and what the characters accomplish.|$|E
5|$|The {{surrender}} of the fortresses began {{a long period}} of conflict between the Greeks of the reconstituted Byzantine Empire and the forces of the Principality for control of the Morea. Prince William was absolved by the Pope of his oaths to Palaiologos, and warfare began almost as soon as he returned to the Principality. Despite this precarious situation, Geoffrey absented himself from the Morea, without William's permission, and spent the years 1263–65 in Italy, ostensibly on a pilgrimage, but in reality <b>living</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> wife of one of his feudatories, John of Katavas. His absence allowed the inhabitants of Skorta to rise up and aid the Byzantine troops in their offensive, which was halted by the same John of Katavas in the Battle of Prinitsa. Geoffrey was again deprived of his barony for this act, but was pardoned and restored to it on his return.|$|E

During this time, Nathan and Cole are {{building}} the condenser, a portal {{that connects the}} world of the <b>living</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> world of the dead—the Infraworld. One night, Nathan learns that his wife and daughter were killed in a car accident. While trying to comfort him, Jodie discovers that she can channel spirits of the dead from the Infraworld; she helps the spirits speak to the living through a psychic link created by her physical contact. As the years pass, a teenage Jodie (Ellen Page) seeks her independence, both from the doctors and from Aiden, and tries several times to live a normal life. At each attempt, Aiden intervenes, ending in disaster.|$|E
