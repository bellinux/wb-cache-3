A computer system will use video-analytic computer software, designed to detect potential threats, such as unattended bags, and retrieve images based on descriptions of terrorists or other criminal suspects.

25|$|The {{issue of}} whether or not to allow any video cameras into the {{courtroom}} was among the first issues Judge Ito had to decide, ultimately ruling that <b>live</b> <b>camera</b> coverage was warranted. Ito would be later criticized for this decision by other legal professionals. Dershowitz said that he believed that Ito, along with others related to the case (Clark, Fuhrman, Kaelin), was influenced to some degree by the media presence, and the related publicity. The trial was covered in 2,237 news segments from 1994 through 1997.|$|E
25|$|VJ {{performance}} {{software is}} highly diverse, and include software which allows {{a computer to}} replace {{the role of an}} analog video mixer and output video across extended canvasses composed of multiple screens or projectors. Small companies producing dedicated VJ software such as Modul8 and Magic give VJs a sophisticated interface for realtime processing of multiple layers of video clips combined with <b>live</b> <b>camera</b> inputs, giving VJs a complete off the shelf solution so they can simply load in the content and perform. Some popular titles which emerged during the 2000s include Resolume, NuVJ.|$|E
25|$|The January 22, 1973 {{broadcast}} of the CBS Evening News saw Cronkite break {{the news of the}} death of another notable American political figure: former president Lyndon B. Johnson. At approximately 6:38pm Eastern Time, while a pre-recorded report that the Vietnam peace talks in Paris had been successful was being played for the audience, Cronkite received a telephone call in the studio while off camera. The call was from Tom Johnson, former spokesman to Lyndon Johnson (no relation), who at the time was also in charge of KTBC, CBS' Austin, Texas affiliate, which the former president owned. During the conversation the production staff cut away from the report back to the <b>live</b> <b>camera</b> in studio as Cronkite was still on the phone. After he was made aware that he was back on camera, Cronkite held up a finger to let everyone watching know he required a moment to let Johnson finish talking. Once Cronkite got what he needed, he thanked Johnson and asked him to stay on the line. He then turned to the camera and began to relay what Johnson had said to him.|$|E

2500|$|This decade saw video {{technology}} {{shift from}} being strictly for professional {{film and television}} studios to being accessible for the prosumer market (e.g. the wedding industry, church presentations, low-budget films, and community television productions). [...] These mixers were quickly adopted by VJs as the core component of their performance setups. This {{is similar to the}} release of the Technics 1200 turntables, which were marketed towards homeowners desiring a more advanced home entertainment system, but were then appropriated by musicians and music enthusiasts for experimentation. Initially, video mixers were used to mix pre-prepared video material from VHSplayers and <b>live</b> <b>camera</b> sources, and later to add the new computer software outputs into their mix. The 90s saw the development of a number of digital video mixers such as Panasonic's WJ-MX50, WJ-MX12, and the Videonics MX-1.|$|E

2500|$|In the UK, Bristol's Children of Technology {{developed}} a dedicated immersive video lightshow using the Virtual Light Machine (VLM) called AVLS or Audio-Visual-Live-System during 1992 and 1993. The VLM was a custom built PC by video engineer Dave Japp using super-rare transputer chips and modified motherboards, programmed by Jeff Minter (Llamasoft & Virtual Light Co.). The VLM {{developed a}}fter Jeff's earlier Llamasoft Light Synthesiser programme. With VLM, DI's from live musicians or DJ's activated Jeff's algorithmic real-time video patterns, {{and this was}} real-time mixed using pansonic video mixers with CGI animation/VHS custom texture library and <b>live</b> <b>camera</b> video feedback. Children of Technology developed their own [...] "Video Light" [...] system, using hi-power and low-power video projection to generate real-time 3D beam effects, simoultaneous with enormous surface and mapped projection. The VLM {{was used by the}} Shamen, The Orb, Primal Scream, Obsession, Peter Gabriel, Prince and many others between 1993 and 1996. A software version of the VLM was integrated into Atari's Jaguar console, in response to growing VJ interest. In the mid-90s, Audio reactive pure synthesis (as opposed to clip-based) software such as Cthugha and Bomb were influential. [...] By the late 90s there were several PC based VJing software available, including generative visuals programs such as MooNSTER, Aestesis, and Advanced Visualization Studio, as well as video clip players such as FLxER, and VJamm.|$|E

In 1993, KXAS-TV launched the [...] "Public Defenders", an investigative reporting unit (consisting of reporters Sabrina Smith, Mike Androvett and Marty Griffin) that conducted investigations into businesses that have ripped off local consumers and uncovered various consumer scams as an ongoing segment during the 10:00p.m. newscast until 1999. On March 28, 2000, the tower camera based in Sundance Square in Fort Worth caught footage of a multiple-vortex F3 tornado that struck the city's downtown area. Master control operators cut to footage of that tornado as it tracked northeastward through central Fort Worth; after a tornado warning was issued for Tarrant County, chief meteorologist David Finfrockâ€”who {{was in the middle}} of a weather segment during that evening's 6:00p.m. newscastâ€”warned viewers about the damaging tornado through on-air illustration via the <b>live</b> <b>camera</b> footage. The station also became notable for an impromptu moment on August 9, 2002, when during a wildlife segment featured on its late-morning newscast, then-anchor Michael Scott got spooked by a gecko that was to be presented later in the segment, which jumped onto him from a nearby table; the clip eventually became one of the earliest viral videos, when it was circulated on YouTube and other video sharing websites later that decade.|$|E
