40|$|Extract: Judging by appearances, there seems, {{in certain}} areas at least, to be some {{evidence}} of a trend towards <b>legal</b> <b>service</b> delivery with a consumer focus in Australia. Mediation appears {{to be one of}} those areas. In fact, ADR, which is a product of different social pressures, has in a sense been a ‘leader’ in consumer-oriented <b>legal</b> <b>service</b> delivery. For example, mediation is said to be ‘person-centred’, unlike litigation, and is voluntary and consensual rather than imposed and coercive. User-friendliness is, undoubtedly, a basic component of consumer-oriented (or user-centred) <b>legal</b> <b>service</b> delivery...|$|R
