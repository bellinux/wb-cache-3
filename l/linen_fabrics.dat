25|$|In December 2011 {{scientists}} at Italy's National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Development ENEA deduced from the STURP results that {{the color of}} the Shroud image is the result of an accelerated aging process of the linen, similar to the yellowing of the paper of ancient books. They demonstrated that the photochemical reactions caused by exposing linen to ultraviolet light could reproduce the main characteristics of the Shroud image, such as the shallowness of the coloration and the gradient of the color, which are not reproducible by other means. When subsequently illuminated with a UV lamp, the irradiated <b>linen</b> <b>fabrics</b> behaved like the linen of the Shroud. They also determined that UV radiation changes the crystalline structure of cellulose in a similar manner as aging and long-duration background radiation.|$|E
25|$|Mamluk Egypt {{was a major}} {{producer}} of textiles and a supplier of raw materials for Western Europe. However, the frequent outbreaks of the Black Plague led {{to a decline in}} the Mamluk territories' production of goods such as textiles, silk products, sugar, glass, soaps, and paper, which coincided with the Europeans' increasing production of these goods. Trade continued nonetheless and despite papal restrictions on trade with the Muslims during the Crusades. Mediterranean trade was dominated by spices, such as pepper, muscat nuts and flowers, cloves and cinnamon, as well as medicinal drugs and indigo. These goods originated in Persia, India, and Southeast Asia and made their way to Europe via the Mamluk ports of Syria and Egypt. These ports were frequented by European merchants, who in turn sold gold and silver ducats and bullions, silk, wool and <b>linen</b> <b>fabrics,</b> furs, wax, honey and cheeses.|$|E
2500|$|Charvet shirts were {{imported}} into the United States {{as early as}} 1853 (See figure right). By 1860, Charvet's shirts turnover was equally divided between luxury bespoke shirts sold in the Paris store and ready made shirts for export, particularly to Russia, Great-Britain and Havana. Also, following the custom of the time, designs and models were sold to American stores, to be locally reproduced. In the 1920s, Charvet's name was associated in the United States with <b>linen</b> <b>fabrics</b> in [...] "startingly floreated" [...] patterns, used for shirt bibs and cuffs. Nevertheless, {{into the middle of}} the 20th century, Charvet was selling only bespoke shirts in the Paris store.|$|E

50|$|The Irish Linen Guild {{has defined}} Irish linen as yarn which is spun in Ireland from 100% flax fibres. Irish <b>linen</b> <b>fabric</b> {{is defined as}} fabric which is woven in Ireland from 100% linen yarns. It is not {{required}} that every stage from the growing of the flax to the weaving must take place in Ireland. To be Irish <b>linen</b> <b>fabric</b> the yarns do not necessarily {{have to come from}} an Irish spinner, and to be Irish linen (yarn) the flax fibre {{does not have to be}} grown in Ireland. However, the skills, craftsmanship, and technology that go into spinning the yarn must be Irish, as is the case with Irish linen fabric; where the design and weaving skills must be Irish, and all of such must take place in Ireland.|$|R

50|$|Jewelry {{was very}} popular in Ancient Egypt, no matter the social class. It was heavy and rather voluminous. The main reason for wearing jewelry is because of its {{aesthetic}} function. The Egyptians were quite soberly dressed in white <b>linen</b> <b>fabrics,</b> and jewelry offered a possibility for contrast. The Egyptian preference was towards the use of bright colors, lustrous stones and precious metals. Gold was won in large quantities in the eastern desert of Egypt, but also came from Nubia, that was an Egyptian colony for centuries.|$|E
50|$|<b>Linen</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{have a high}} natural luster; {{their natural}} color ranges between shades of ivory, ecru, tan, or grey. Pure white linen is created by heavy bleaching. Linen fabric {{typically}} varies somewhat in thickness and is crisp and textured, but it can in some cases feel stiff and rough, and in other cases feel soft and smooth. When properly prepared, linen fabric {{has the ability to}} absorb and lose water rapidly. Linen can absorb a fair amount of moisture without feeling unpleasantly damp to the skin, unlike cotton.|$|E
