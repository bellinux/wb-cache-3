5|$|There {{are seven}} main plot lines that the player {{will have the}} chance to experience. Throughout gameplay, the player is given {{multiple}} options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and make different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. When first playing the game, the scenarios for all six heroines are available. Once a scenario for any one heroine is completed, that scenario will be unavailable in the next play through because the <b>last</b> <b>choice</b> that will ultimately lead to that heroine's scenario becomes unavailable for players to choose. After the completion of these six routes, the final scenario called Refrain is made available, which serves to bring everything to a definite conclusion and answers questions brought up throughout the normal gameplay. Completing Refrain makes available all the heroine's scenarios that were previously made inaccessible during gameplay so that the player can revisit the scenarios again, along with some extra decision points that were previously unavailable.|$|E

Currie had been elected to the Dáil in the 1989 general election and had been a minister in Brian Faulkner's power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland from 1973–1974.

25|$|Robinson's {{campaign}} was boosted {{by a lack}} of organisation in Fine Gael, the main opposition party. Fine Gael had previously gambled that former Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald would run as its candidate, even though he had insisted for two years that he would not run for office. When it was apparent that FitzGerald would not budge from his refusal, Fine Gael approached another senior figure, Peter Barry, who had previously been willing to run but had run out of patience and was no longer interested. The party ultimately nominated the former civil rights campaigner Austin Currie, a respected new TD and former minister in Brian Faulkner's power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland from 1973–74. Currie had little experience in the politics of the Republic and was widely seen as the party's <b>last</b> <b>choice,</b> nominated only when no-one else was available. Fianna Fáil chose Tánaiste and Minister for Defence Brian Lenihan. In three decades in politics, Lenihan had become very popular, and was widely seen as humorous and intelligent. Like Robinson he had himself delivered liberal policy reform (abolished censorship in the 1960s, for example).|$|E

40|$|Abstract In most {{problem-solving}} activities, {{feedback is}} received {{at the end}} of an action sequence. This creates a credit-assignment problem where the learner must associate the feedback with earlier actions, and the interdependencies of actions require the learner to remember past choices of actions. In two studies, we investigated the nature of explicit and implicit learning processes in the credit-assignment problem using a probabilistic sequential choice task with and without a secondary memory task. We found that when explicit learning was dominant, learning was faster to select the better option in their Wrst choices than in the <b>last</b> <b>choices.</b> When implicit reinforcement learning was dominant, learning was faster to select the better option in their <b>last</b> <b>choices</b> than in their Wrst choices. Consistent with the probabilitylearning and sequence-learning literature, the results show that credit assignment involves two processes: an explicit memory encoding process that requires memory rehearsals and an implicit reinforcement-learning process that propagates credits backwards to previous choices...|$|R

After a month away from the band, he rejoined Red Hot Chili Peppers in Los Angeles to record the group's next album, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987). The Chili Peppers attempted to hire Rick Rubin to produce their third album, but he declined. The band eventually hired Michael Beinhorn from the art funk project Material, the band's <b>last</b> <b>choice.</b> Kiedis sat down with producer Michael Beinhorn to discuss the recording of the album; Kiedis planned to record the album in ten days and write the songs during the recording sessions. Songs began to form quickly, and the album took shape, blending the same funk feel and rhythms as Freaky Styley, with a harder, more immediate approach to punk rock.|$|E
2500|$|The {{industry}} {{has been accused of}} making unscientific claims, and distorting facts relating to infertility, in particular through widely exaggerated claims about how common infertility is in society, in an attempt to get as many couples as possible and as soon as possible to try treatments (rather than trying to conceive naturally for a longer time). This risks removing infertility from its social context and reducing the experience to a simple biological malfunction, which not only can be treated through bio-medical procedures, but should be treated by them. Indeed, there are serious concerns about the overuse of treatments, for instance Dr Sami David, a fertility specialist and one of the pioneers of {{the early days of the}} IVF treatments, has expressed disappointment over the current state of the industry, and said many procedures are unnecessary; he said: [...] "It's being the first choice of treatment rather than the <b>last</b> <b>choice.</b> When it was first opening up in late 1970s, early 80s, it was meant to be the last resort. [...] Now it's a first resort. [...] I think that's an injustice to women. I also think it can harm women in the long run." [...] IVF thus raises ethical issues concerning the abuse of bio-medical facts to ‘sell’ corrective procedures and treatments for conditions that deviate from a constructed ideal of the ‘healthy’ or ‘normal’ body i.e., fertile females and males with reproductive systems capable of co-producing offspring.|$|E

2500|$|Ryan {{began to}} seek funding {{to help support}} the project. Ryan had {{initially}} developed a short demonstration of the game based on trying to calm Joel during {{that night at the}} hospital, which he and Larson demonstrated at the 2013 Game Developers Conference. The translated scene in the demonstration had the player, as Ryan, at home with Joel at their nursery, with Joel constantly crying. Though numerous objects such as toys and books are given for the player to try to calm Joel down, none of them work, and attempting to leave the nursery was forbidden; only until all of the provided options were tried was the player given the <b>last</b> <b>choice</b> to sit down and resort to prayer to calm Joel down. The demonstration caught the attention of many of the media there, putting the title into the limelight. Several investors stepped forward to offer to help fund the completion of the game, but some of these investors later backed out, considering the project to be too risky. Ryan Green had been able to secure a deal with funding from Ouya to develop the game, in exchange for a time-limited exclusivity for the micro-console. Much of this came from Kellee Santiago, who at the time had been recently named as Ouya's head of developer relations. After seeing the game at its current state in early 2013, Santiago [...] "felt it needed to be made". The Ouya funding helped to support the Greens and Larson, as well as enabling them to hire three more developers. When Green announced the Ouya deal in August 2013, approximately {{a few months after the}} console's public release to lukewarm reception, many criticized Green's choice due to the poor perception of the Ouya system, as well as a poorly worded Twitter message that Ouya had used to announce the product. Green defended his choice for opting for the Ouya, stating the company behind the device has good intentions towards the larger goal.|$|E

60|$|No {{doubt there}} had been very much of heaven in Ralph Newton's <b>last</b> <b>choice.</b> It may be {{acknowledged}} that in lieu of choosing at all, {{he had left the}} matter altogether to heaven. Some attempt he had made at choosing,--in reference to Mary Bonner; but he had found the attempt simply to be troublesome and futile. He had spoken soft, loving words to Clarissa, because she herself had been soft and lovable. Nature had spoken,--as she does when the birds sing to each other. Then, again, while suffering under pecuniary distress he had endeavoured to make himself believe that Polly Neefit was just the wife for him. Then, amidst the glories of his emancipation from thraldom, he had seen Mary Bonner,--and had actually, after a fashion, made a choice for himself. His choice had brought upon him nothing but disgrace and trouble. Now he had succumbed at the bidding of heaven and Lady Eardham, and he was about to be provided with a wife exactly suited for him. It may be said {{at the same time that}} Augusta Eardham was equally lucky. She also had gotten all that she ought to have wanted, had she known what to want. They were both of them incapable of what men and women call love when they speak of love as a passion linked with romance. And in one sense they were cold-hearted. Neither of them was endowed with the privilege of pining because another person had perished. But each of them was able to love a mate, when assured that that mate must continue to be mate, unless separation should come by domestic earthquake. They had hearts enough for paternal and maternal duties, and would probably agree in thinking that any geese which Providence might send them were veritable swans. Bickerings there might be, but they would be bickerings without effect; and Ralph Newton, of Newton, would probably so live with this wife of his bosom, that they, too, might lie at last pleasantly together in the family vault, with the record of their homely virtues visible to the survivors of the parish on the same tombstone. The means by which each of them would have arrived at these blessings would not redound to the credit of either; but the blessings would be there, and it may be said of their marriage, as of many such marriages, that it was made in heaven, and was heavenly.|$|E

I describe the woman’s behavior in marriage {{in order to see}} if surname choice matters beyond information on how the woman is “performing. ” In addition, I examine whether name change varies depending on the educational attainment and gender of the evaluator. While overall, <b>last</b> name <b>choice</b> appears to have little impact on how women are viewed among women and highly educated men, I find that men of low education view women who retain their surnames in marriage as less committed wives. These men also think women who retain their surnames should be held to higher standards than women with their husbands’ last names. My results follow scholarship that finds that men of lower education are more protective of overt instances of the gender hierarchy, of which surname practices are an important example...|$|R
60|$|It {{was with}} a most awkward and unwonted feeling that after {{entering}} and closing {{the door of his}} room he sat down, opened the morocco case, and held up each of the fragile bits of gold-work before his eyes. Many things had become old to the solitary man of letters, but these were new, and he handled like a child an outcome of civilization which had never before been touched by his fingers. A sudden fastidious decision that the pattern chosen would not suit her after all caused him to rise in a flurry and tear down the street to change them for others. After a great deal of trouble in reselecting, during which his mind became so bewildered that the critical faculty on objects of art seemed to have vacated his person altogether, Knight carried off another pair of ear-rings. These remained in his possession till the afternoon, when, after contemplating them fifty times with a growing misgiving that the <b>last</b> <b>choice</b> was worse than the first, he felt that no sleep would visit his pillow till he had improved upon his previous purchases yet again. In a perfect heat of vexation with himself for such tergiversation, he went anew to the shop-door, was absolutely ashamed to enter and give further trouble, went to another shop, bought a pair at an enormously increased price, because they seemed the very thing, asked the goldsmiths if they would take the other pair in exchange, was told that they could not exchange articles bought of another maker, paid down the money, and went off with the two pairs in his possession, wondering what on earth to do with the superfluous pair. He almost wished he could lose them, or that somebody would steal them, and was burdened with an interposing sense that, as a capable man, with true ideas of economy, he must necessarily sell them somewhere, which he did at last for a mere song. Mingled with a blank feeling of a whole day being lost to him in running about the city on this new and extraordinary class of errand, and of several pounds being lost through his bungling, was a slight sense of satisfaction that he had emerged for ever from his antediluvian ignorance on the subject of ladies' jewellery, as well as secured a truly artistic production at last. During the remainder of that day he scanned the ornaments of every lady he met with the profoundly experienced eye of an appraiser.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{repeated}} conflicting situation {{between two}} agents {{is presented in}} the context of adversarial decision making. The agents simultaneously choose an action as a response to an external event, and accumulate some payoff for their decisions. The next event statistically depends on the <b>last</b> <b>choices</b> of the agents. The objective of the first agent, called the imitator, is to imitate the behaviour of the other. The second agent tries not to be properly predicted while, at the same time, choosing actions that report a high payoff. When the situation is repeated through time, the imitator has the opportunity to learn the adversary’s behaviour. In this work, we present a way to automatically design a sequence of deterministic decisions for one of the agents maximizing the expected payoff while keeping his choices difficult to predict. Determinism provides some practical advantages over partially randomized strategies investigated in previous works, mainly the reduction of the variance of the payoff when using the strategy.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} ordering effects in choice experiments, and in particular how learning processes potentially affect respondents' stated preferences in a sequence of choice sets. In a case study concerning food quality attributes of chicken breast filets, we find evidence of ordering effects in a sequence of 16 choice sets, where the <b>last</b> eight <b>choice</b> sets are identical to the first eight. We find evidence of changes in preferences. More precisely {{there are differences in}} preferences for the price attribute for the two identical sequences. Moreover, we find a reduction in the error variance for the <b>last</b> eight <b>choice</b> sets relative to the first eight choice sets. This is mainly caused by very high error variances in the first two choice sets. These results imply that learning effects in terms of institutional learning as well as – though in our case only to a limited extent – preference learning can indeed be of significant structural importance when conducting CE surveys...|$|R
40|$|Current {{analyses}} of the so-called "neoconservative" turn in US foreign policy tend to neglect its economic requirements and consequences.

The phenomenon that we should examine, if unilateralism {{is going to be a}} <b>lasting</b> <b>choice,</b> is a return to huge external borrowing requirement since Reagan’s “Star Wars” programme. The paper, intended for a non-economist readership, seeks to ascertain whether the ensuing scenario will be stable and sustainable from two interrelated perspectives.

Participants made more errors when required to track more partners. We conducted agent-based simulations to evaluate how well cooperative strategies cope with error. These simulations suggest that, even with few errors, cooperation could not be maintained at the error rates demonstrated by our participants. Our results indicate that the strategies typically used in the study of cooperation likely do not reflect the underlying cognitive capacities used by humans and other animals in social interactions. By including unrealistic assumptions about cognition, theoretical models may have overestimated the robustness of the existing cooperative strategies. To remedy this, future models should incorporate what we know about cognition...|$|R
