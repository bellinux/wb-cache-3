He wrote for popular periodicals like Popular Science and Cosmopolitan and literary journals <b>like</b> <b>American</b> Monthly Review of Reviews.

5|$|Since 1788, English {{has been}} spoken in Oceania, and Australian English has {{developed}} as a first language {{of the vast majority}} of the inhabitants of the Australian continent, its standard accent being General Australian. The English of neighbouring New Zealand has to a lesser degree become an influential standard variety of the language. Australian and New Zealand English are each other's closest relatives with few differentiating characteristics, followed by South African English and the English of southeastern England, all of which have similarly non-rhotic accents, aside from some accents in the South Island of New Zealand. Australian and New Zealand English stand out for their innovative vowels: many short vowels are fronted or raised, whereas many long vowels have diphthongised. Australian English also has a contrast between long and short vowels, not found in most other varieties. Australian English grammar aligns closely to British and American English; <b>like</b> <b>American</b> English, collective plural subjects take on a singular verb (as in the government is rather than are). New Zealand English uses front vowels that are often even higher than in Australian English.|$|E
5|$|The club won {{its first}} FA Cup in 1887, under the {{captaincy}} of another Scotsman, Archie Hunter. They beat West Bromwich Albion 2–0 {{in the final}} held at The Oval. Up until 1885, football had remained an amateur sport. It turned professional in 1885, when the FA legalized professional football, but with a national wage limit. However, the Scottish draper and director of Aston Villa, William McGregor had become frustrated with watching his team in one-sided friendly matches and low attendances for all games but FA Cup ties. He saw {{that in order to}} keep interest in the game alive, the top teams needed to play each other in a league much <b>like</b> <b>American</b> baseball teams did. McGregor wrote to the twelve leading clubs in England proposing the formation of a league, what would later be known as the English Football League. Aston Villa were one of the dozen teams that competed in the inaugural Football League in 1888. Villa's first League game came on 8 September 1888, when they drew 1–1 Wolverhampton Wanderers as Tom Green scored the club's first League goal. Villa finished runners-up to Preston North End in that inaugural season.|$|E

25|$|On {{the third}} argument, Drake argued that, <b>like</b> <b>American</b> courts {{had done in}} similar cases, the High Court should look to the {{substantive}} effect of the Tasmanian legislation in considering whether it interfered with an exclusive power of the federal parliament. Justice O'Connor asked Drake whether his argument applied to D'Emden because he was {{an officer of the}} Department, or merely because he had performed services for the Department, and Drake responded that his reasoning was not based on the person but {{on the fact that the}} salary receipt was a departmental record.|$|E

25|$|The Cabinet {{was also}} {{relatively}} elderly, and with younger political {{leaders on the}} scene, <b>like</b> <b>American</b> President John F. Kennedy, {{at a time of}} dramatic social changes, Macmillan resolved to bring some younger men into important posts. The seven ministers earmarked for replacement averaged 59 years of age. The incoming seven would have an average age of 50. Butler was in favour of the move, and together with Macleod, they worked out an orderly reshuffle of several Cabinet posts, including the Chancellor of the Exchequer. In all, seven ministers were to be replaced, amounting to one third of the total Cabinet of twenty-one.|$|E
25|$|American waffles vary significantly. Generally denser {{and thinner}} than the Belgian waffle, {{they are often}} made from a batter leavened with baking powder, which is {{sometimes}} mixed with pecans, chocolate drops or berries and may be round, square, or rectangular in shape. <b>Like</b> <b>American</b> pancakes they are usually served as a sweet breakfast food, topped with butter and maple syrup, bacon, and other fruit syrups, honey, or powdered sugar. They are also found in many different savory dishes, such as fried chicken and waffles or topped with kidney stew. They may also be served as desserts, topped with ice cream and various other toppings. A large chain (over 2,100 locations) of waffle specialty diners, Waffle House, is ubiquitous in the southern United States.|$|E

25|$|Oberstar was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of the Head Start Program, which is a national program from the Department of Health and Human Services to promote school readiness by enhancing social and cognitive development of children through the provision of educational, health, nutritional, social, and other services.
