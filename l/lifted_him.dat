5|$|After {{the match}} ended, David Sammartino, {{accompanied}} by his father Bruno Sammartino, and Brutus Beefcake, accompanied by Johnny Valiant, {{made their way to}} the ring. The action favoured both contestants, as each wrestler alternated having the advantage. After Beefcake threw David Sammartino out of the ring, Valiant <b>lifted</b> <b>him</b> up and slammed him to the cement floor. He then pushed Sammartino back into the ring before being attacked by Bruno. A short while later, all four men began fighting in the ring, and the match ended in a no-contest.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} four quarterfinal matches in the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament opened Sacrifice.

Near the end, Team 3D set up {{a table in the}} middle of the ring. Sting then turned on Storm and <b>lifted</b> <b>him</b> off the turnbuckle and slammed him through the table. Devon covered Storm for the win, thereby advancing himself and Brother Ray in the tournament.|$|E
5|$|In the 1926 {{season as}} a whole, Larwood took 137 wickets at 18.31; with the bat he scored 451 runs at 12.88. No Tests were played in 1927; Larwood's {{performances}} for Nottinghamshire, however, <b>lifted</b> <b>him</b> {{to the top of}} the national bowling averages—100 wickets at 16.95—and he was chosen as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year. His efforts could not quite secure the County Championship title for Nottinghamshire; they finished second after losing their final match to Glamorgan. The 1927 season saw the first appearance in the Nottinghamshire side of Bill Voce, a 17-year-old ex-miner who, after beginning as a slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler, later became Larwood's principal fast bowling partner for county and country. At the season's end, Larwood was married, in a quiet and private ceremony, to Lois Bird, a miner's daughter whom he had first met in 1925.|$|E

5|$|The Fourth Test at Headingley in Leeds saw Morris at his finest; England {{elected to}} bat and started {{strongly}} with 496 {{in the first}} innings, their highest score of the series. On a placid pitch, Morris was one of seven bowlers used as Bradman sought a breakthrough; {{each of the first}} three wickets put on century partnerships. Bill Edrich hit a long hop from Morris's left arm unorthodox spin to the boundary to reach his century, before Bedser <b>lifted</b> <b>him</b> high over square leg for six. This prompted Bradman to replace Morris after he conceded 20 runs in five overs as England reached 2/423. Edrich was out when he attempted to pull Johnson to the on side in the large gap between mid-on and square leg, but only hit it in the air to Morris, who completed the catch diving forwards at wide mid-on to leave the score at 4/426, before England collapsed to 496.|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was contested for in an Iron Man {{match in}} the seventh match, as then-champion, A.J. Styles, defended the title against Christopher Daniels. The first fall of the match came when Daniels pinned Styles {{following}} bending Styles forward, placing Styles' head between his legs, tucked Styles' arms behind Styles' back, <b>lifted</b> <b>him</b> up, turned 90°, and dropped to the mat to force Styles' face into the mat in what Daniels dubbed the Angel's Wings. Styles scored the second fall by pinning Daniels with a roll-up, tying the match one fall apiece. Before the deciding fall to break the tie could take place, the thirty-minute time limit ran out. Daniels then demanded the match go into overtime/sudden death, which he was granted by Dusty Rhodes. The deciding pinfall saw Styles grab Daniels, lift him up, hold him upside down, trap Daniels' arms behind his legs, and jump forward to implant Daniels entire body into the mat in a move Styles dubbed the Styles Clash to retain the X Division Championship.|$|E

His first bestseller was Demon Seed, the sales of which picked up {{after the release of}} the film of the same name in 1977, and sold over two million copies in one year.

In his later years, he modified the story to say the injury occurred when the conductor, in helping him onto a moving train, <b>lifted</b> <b>him</b> by the ears.|$|E

It also secured his entry into the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship and the Masters. Two weeks after winning the Abu Dhabi Golf Championship, he finished second in the Dubai Desert Classic. He finished the tournament with birdie-birdie-eagle but world number one Tiger Woods topped him by one stroke. Kaymer moved up to a high of 21st in the world rankings due to his runner-up finish.|$|E
25|$|Liang {{began the}} new season by {{qualifying}} for the last 48 of the Northern Ireland Trophy. At the venue he then beat Steve Davis and Peter Ebdon to reach the last 16, where he lost to John Higgins 1–5. This result <b>lifted</b> <b>him</b> to a provisional career high of 26 in the world. At the Grand Prix he reached the main draw by winning 2 qualifying matches, but then succumbed to Ronnie O'Sullivan {{in the first round}} of the main draw. He then made a 147 (and three other centuries, including two total clearances of 139) in a 5–1 victory over Martin Gould in the third qualifying round of the Bahrain Championship. However, he failed to qualify for the main draw, losing 2–5 to Michael Judge.|$|E
25|$|In April 1991, a quirk {{in the way}} {{the rankings}} treated results from {{previous}} years meant that Ian Woosnam, who had never won a major, took the No. 1 spot from Faldo {{on the eve of the}} latter's attempt to win the Masters for a third year in succession; as if justifying the ranking system, Woosnam—and not Faldo—won the tournament. Twelve months later, Fred Couples similarly took over the No. 1 ranking shortly before the 1992 Masters, then also went on to make that tournament his first major victory. Faldo's Open victory in 1992 <b>lifted</b> <b>him</b> back to the No. 1 position, and he held that spot until replaced by Nick Price, who in 1994 became the first African ranked No. 1 after his back-to-back major victories that summer.|$|E

According to Ali ibn al-Athir, Raymond agreed {{to come to terms with}} the king only after his vassals threatened him with disobedience, and the prelates also announced that they were ready to excommunicate him and to declare his marriage void. Raymond and the king met near Jerusalem, at Fort St Job, which was held by the Hospitallers. After they both dismounted, Raymond did homage to the king on his knees. Guy soon <b>lifted</b> <b>him</b> up and expressed regret for his irregular coronation, according to Ernoul.|$|E
25|$|Norman endured another setback at the 1987 Masters. In {{his final}} round on the 18th green, Norman had a 20-foot putt for a birdie that {{would win the}} tournament. The ball trickled over the left lip of the cup, missing by millimetres. After Norman's par on the 72nd hole at Augusta, {{he found himself in}} a sudden-death playoff with Larry Mize and Seve Ballesteros. On the second playoff hole, with Ballesteros eliminated, Mize holed a 47-yard (140-foot) chip to win the tournament. Norman did, however, win the Australian Masters in February 1987 and the Australian Open later in the year by a record ten shots at Royal Melbourne Golf Club, beating the {{previous}} Australian Open record winning margin of eight strokes by Jack Nicklaus in 1971. Norman's 1987 victory at the Australian Open <b>lifted</b> <b>him</b> back above Seve Ballesteros {{to the top of the}} Official World Golf Ranking.|$|E
25|$|After a seventh-place {{finish in}} the opening round in Bahrain, Button won the second race in Australia from fourth on the grid.

He {{inherited}} the lead when Vettel retired with brake problems and maintained his lead to the end without changing his tyres again. His victory made him the thirteenth driver in Formula One history to have won Grands Prix for at least three different constructors. Following an eighth-place finish in Malaysia, after starting seventeenth, Button went on to win his second race of the season from fifth on the grid in China, by staying on slick tyres while most of the other drivers pitted for intermediates, he was promoted to second place. However, the rain did not come, and the other drivers had to pit again for dry tyres. Subsequently, he went on to lead the Drivers' Championship, with McLaren leading the Constructors' Championship.|$|E
