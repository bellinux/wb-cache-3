30|$|Our results {{indicate}} that the rupture occurred in both shallow and deep parts of the Nicobar region (areas B and C); this result was further obtained by Lorito et al. ([2010]). Two large <b>left</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>fault</b> mechanism aftershocks (Mw 7.2, Mw 7.5) occurred in the Nicobar region. The depths of the aftershocks obtained by Global CMT were 12 and 33 km, respectively, and these aftershocks were considered to be a reactivation of the fracture zone of the subducted oceanic plate triggered by the main shock. Unless the rupture occurred in the shallow near-trench region, a positive Coulomb stress change for the two aftershocks was not produced (Delescluse et al. [2012] On the other hand, the subsidences of approximately 3 m in the Nicobar Islands and Great Nicobar were not explained only by the shallow slip; to cause these subsidences, the deep part slip is necessary. These facts support both the shallow and deep part slips in the Nicobar region obtained by our result; however, these subsidences may be caused by not only coseismic slip but also postseismic slip in the deep part.|$|E
30|$|We {{carried out}} both {{absolute}} and relative gravity measurements in the Izu Peninsula just {{before and after}} the March 1997 earthquake swarm occurred. The measurements revealed significant absolute gravity changes, which we find to be made of three spatial components. The first one is located near Cape Kawana, and would be associated with the volcanic activity that caused the earthquake swarm. The second one would be associated with shallow and localized magma intrusion just beneath Ito. The third one may be due to a change in the deep region beneath the Kita-Izu fault system, which {{is considered to be a}} major tectonic line of this region. The gravity changes can be used to detect underground mass movement. For this purpose, we first use crustal movement observations to construct an elastic dislocation model with two tensile faults and a <b>left</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>fault.</b> Then we use the gravity changes to constrain the density of the material which filled the tensile faults. We find that the density is likely to be small, and that the gravity changes of the first component are reproduced well by the fault model. The smallness of the density implies that highly vesiculated magma or water would have injected into the faults.|$|E
40|$|We use seismic {{reflection}} {{profiles of}} diverse resolutions integrated with high resolution bathymetry and calibrated by deep wells, piston cores and field data to derive a structural and stratigraphic {{interpretation of the}} Southeastern peri-Tyrrhenian Basins. The study area {{is located in the}} Southeastern Tyrrhenian Sea offshore Calabria. We document a tectono-stratigraphic evolution of the sedimentary basins from the Serravallian to the Present. The basins formation started during the Serravallian and the area was successively affected by E–W normal faulting and approximately N–S transfer faults in the Messinian–Lower Pleistocene time range. During the Lower Pleistocene the tectonic depressions, completely filled with sediments, were affected by folding associated with. transcurrent tectonics along a NW-trending <b>left</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>fault.</b> Finally, during the Middle Pleistocene, a change in the slip direction produced minor pull-apart basins that overprinted the folds. The basin analysis revealed the stratigraphic signature of the tectonic events and, the uplifting and subsiding areas and the direction from which sediments arrive into the tectonic depression. The four-dimensional geologic reconstruction of the Margin of Calabria furnished new constrains for the kinematic evolution of the Southeastern peri-Tyrrhenian Basins. We suggest that the superposition of different structural styles reflects a variation of the relative velocity between the Southern Apennine Arc and the Calabria Arc during the formation of the Apennine.

Plate 3; Columnar sections, in back pocket. Base map constructed from two-hundred 1 : 30, 000 aerial-photographs. Coordinates are only approximately correct. The 680 square mile area lies between lat. 28 ?? 30 ' and 29 ?? 00 ' N., and long. 114 ?? 00 and 114 ?? 40 ' W. on the Pacific slope of the Baja California Peninsula. Cretaceous eugeosynclinal rocks of the Aptian-Albian Alisitos Formation and quartz diorite and granodiorite of the Peninsular Range Batholith occur as an eastward-rising crystalline basement complex. North-south faults and folds were apparently formed contemporaneously with emplacement of the batholithic rocks. The Rosarito Fault, a northwest-trending <b>left</b> <b>lateral</b> (?) <b>fault,</b> disrupted the north-south structures before the deposition of Paleocene sedimentary rocks. The position of this fault suggests it {{may be part of}} a major transverse fracture system extending across the peninsula. The basement complex is overlain by a thin veneer of generally undeformed west-dipping Cenozoic sedimentary and volcanic rocks. Paleocene marine deposits contain a brackish water "Martinez" fauna, including Turritella pachecoensis. Interfingering with these beds are continental sediments from which W. J. Morris (1966) described ungulates of the orders Tillodontia, Perissodactyla, and Pantodonta, forms characteristic of the Clarkforkian lower Tertiary of the Rocky Mountains. Unconformably overlying the Paleocene sedimentary rocks are Miocene eolian(?) sandstone, rhyolite tuffs, and basalt flows which thicken eastward toward the Gulf of California. Most of the region was emergent during the late Tertiary and in the Quaternary. Intermittent Quaternary volcanism appears to have been associated with reactivation of a segment of the northwest-trending Upper Cretaceous Rosarito Fault...|$|E
40|$|The Lava Mountains are a {{range of}} low {{mountains}} along {{the northern edge of}} the Mojave Desert, California. The pre-Tertiary rocks consist of a few small pendants of metamorphic rocks in Atolia quartz monzonite. Overlying these are small patches of volcanic and sedimentary rocks, probably Tertiary, which project into the later formations. The major sedimentary unit is the middle Pliocene Bedrock Spring formation; it consists chiefly of arkosic sandstone and conglomerate with lesser amounts of siltstone and brecciated volcanic rocks. Overlying this formation are two late Pliocene formations, the Almond Mountain volcanics and Klinker Mountain volcanics in the eastern and western parts of the area, respectively. Small areas of other late Pliocene(?) volcanic rocks are locally present. Overlying these are flows of the Lava Mountains andesite of very late Pliocene age. The Pleistocene(?) Christmas Canyon formation is restricted to the eastern half of the area. A few small dikes of basalt cut this formation. Quaternary gravels, alluvium, and travertine are the youngest deposits. Within the area, three fault systems converge. The Garlock fault trends N. 75 ° E. along {{the north side of the}} area; it is a <b>left</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>fault.</b> The Blackwater fault trends N. 45 ° W. in the southeastern part of the region; it has right-lateral and normal displacements. The Brown's Ranch fault zone and its associated faults trend about N. 55 ° E. in the western part of the area; both left-lateral and dip-slip displacements are found. The Dome Mountain anticline trends parallel to and south of the Garlock fault. Remnants of late Cenozoic pediments indicate that the drainage at that time was toward the north; later, the eastern part of the region warped, thus blocking the previous drainage direction. No commercial mines are in the area although extensive prospects are present in the southwestern portion. All of the volcanic rocks are plagioclase andesite porphyries. Plagioclase (3 - 23 percent), biotite (0 - 2 percent), orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene (0 - 2 percent), quartz (0 - 3 percent), and opaques (1 - 11 percent) are found as crystals in a partly-crystalline to glassy groundmass. As the Pliocene volcanic sequence progressed, the lavas became more homogeneous, more effusive, and more frequently erupted. The mineral and chemical compositions did not change systematically. The melt originated by the fusion of quartz monzonite. There is no evidence of fractionation, crystal settling, or continued assimilation during the volcanic sequence...|$|E

40|$|The Bakken {{formation}} in the Elm Coulee Field of the Williston Basin consists of three members: 1) upper shale member, 2) middle silty dolostone member, and 3) lower shale member. The upper and lower members act as excellent source rocks and the main reservoir is the middle member with an average porosity of 3 to 9 % and average permeability of 0. 04 md. The Bakken oil play {{in this area is}} a stratigraphic trap with a pinch-out to the southwest and a diagenetic facies change in the northeast. The main production is interpreted to come from matrix permeability in the field area. However, the first year production trends from the Elm Coulee Field show areas of anomalously high production. This study used 3 D seismic data from Crane Field, which is located in the southeastern part of the Elm Coulee Field, to investigate structures which might be responsible for the anomalous production trends at the Elm Coulee Field. We used post stack seismic conditioning and seismic attributes to amplify the structure of the basement. Further investigation revealed the presence of a pop-up structure in the central portion overlying a zone of basement deformation. This zone of deformation was interpreted to be composed of a <b>left</b> <b>lateral</b> wrench <b>faulting</b> system based on a model-driven approach. This study goes on further to map the structure and faults in 3 dimensions using a model driven approach, which reveals that the pop-up structure evolved from an obtuse angle <b>left</b> <b>lateral</b> step over system in the basement. In addition, the presence of this <b>left</b> <b>lateral</b> wrench <b>fault</b> network is interpreted to be related to a regional <b>left</b> <b>lateral</b> strike slip system – the Brockton Froid Fault Zone The fracture network characteristics in the middle member of the Bakken Formation are directly related to the local stresses generated by the interpreted <b>left</b> <b>lateral</b> wrench <b>fault</b> system in the study.

The regions of anomalously high EURs in the Elm Coulee Field may be regions where the middle member of the Bakken Formation has increased natural fracturing related to the local stresses induced by left-lateral oblique slip strike slip faults.

Here mineralisation is associated with quartz veins up to 13. 6 m thick. Vein textures and breccia components indicate repeated sealing and subsequent brecciation of wall rock and pre-existing vein infill. Field and petrographic analyses characterize E-W trending veins as <b>left</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>faults,</b> whilst NE- SW trending veins are extensional (Mode I) fractures. Cataclasite and tectonic breccia of wall rocks and early quartz, hydrothermal crackle breccias, and matrix supported chaotic breccias of pre- existing vein infill, {{all of which are}} cemented by late iron-oxide-bearing quartz, indicate that co- seismic rupturing and hydraulic fracturing are two major permeability enhancement mechanisms. In addition, transient variations in local stress direction, caused by syn-mineralisation dyke intrusion, may have enhanced permeability on mis-oriented surfaces and at locations where the dip changes. This study emphasizes the importance of understanding structural geology and kinematics as controls on the location of boiling and mineralisation mechanisms in epithermal gold deposits...|$|R

At the west end of these grabens and half-grabens are the Pochotitan and the more northerly San Pedro fault systems, which form the western boundary of the faults in the southern mountains. In the north there is an unknown boundary between the Cortes Terrane and the Guerrero Composite Terrane.

In the central Aleutians, there is good agreement between areas of high coupling and areas of large moment release in major seismogenic events. We have combined modeling results from the Aleutians with direct measurements of station velocities of sites in western Alaska and the Bering Sea islands {{to test the hypothesis}} of a clockwise rotating Bering plate. The Bering Sea area including the Aleutian arc and western Alaska is fit by an Euler pole located at 42. 5 °N, 121. 3 °E with an angular velocity of 6. 0 °/my, relative to stable North America.

In Lebanon, the LFS splits {{into three}} main branches, on land and offshore: the <b>left</b> <b>lateral</b> strike-slip Yammouneh <b>Fault</b> (last known rupture: 1202, M 7.5), the Beirut–Tripoli Thrust (551, M 7 +) and the Rachaya–Serghaya Fault (1759, M 6.5). The 551 event was {{accompanied}} by a tsunami hitting the whole eastern Mediterranean coast, destroying several cities including Beirut, Tripoli, Saida and Tyre. The most recent large earthquake is the double shock of March 16, 1956 (Ms =  4.8 – 5.1) which killed 136 people, destroyed 6000 houses and damaged 17, 000 houses (Brazee and Cloud 1984; Khair et al. 2000). Seismological trenches have shown that the return period of devastating earthquakes is about 1100  years along the Yammouneh Fault (Daëron et al. 2007), 1500 – 1750  years along the Mount Lebanon Thrust (Elias et al. 2007) and ~ 1300  years along Serghaya Faults (Gomez et al. 2003).|$|R
