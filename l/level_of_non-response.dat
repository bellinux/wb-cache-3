40|$|Fishermen on piers and privately-owned {{boats in}} {{southern}} California were surveyed {{to determine their}} ability to identify (by common name) 18 of the more commonly caught sportfish. Anglers were shown color photographs of the fish and asked to identify them. Most people {{were not able to}} identify more than 5 or 6 species correctly. The number of incorrect responses (calling one species by another's name, or using a non-recommended common name) was not high. Instead, it was the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-response</b> (the fisherman {{had no idea what the}} species was) that was surprisingly high. The results of the survey indicate that anglers are not familiar with the names of the fish they are most likely to catch. This has serious implications concerning our fishery management programs which depend on anglers' compliance with fishing regulations. The effectiveness of the programs depends in part on anglers being able to recognize regulated species when encountered. (30 pp. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to examine whether {{providing}} pollsters with multiple opportunities to carry out interviews with a sample of randomly selected respondents reduces non-response bias. First, I present the procedures for assessing non-response bias in sociological surveys, opting for a method based on post-stratifi cation weights. Next, using a unique dataset, I address four basic questions related to the research problem: (1) Do more contact attempts reduce the dissimilarity between the sample and population distributions? (2) Do more contact attempts reduce the need for post-stratifi cation weighting? (3) Which categories of respondents are underrepresented and/or overrepresented in the sample in the early and late contact attempts? (4) Do more contact attempts reduce non-response bias? While more contact attempts increased the response rate and closed the gap between sample and population, they do not always reduce the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-response</b> bias. Indeed, for some types of variables, the more contact attempts, the larger the non-response bias.

40|$|Nearly all {{establishment}} {{surveys are}} prone to some <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-response.</b> Non-response may lead to biases in survey estimates {{and an increase in}} survey sampling variance. Survey practitioners use various techniques to reduce bias due to non-response. The most common technique is to adjust the sampling weights of responding units to account for non-responding units within a specified set of weighting classes or cells. In the National Compensation Survey (NCS), which is an establishment survey conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the weighting cells are formed using available auxiliary information: ownership, industry, and establishment employment size. At JSM 2006, we presented a paper in which we explored how effective the formed cells are in reducing potential bias in the NCS estimates and presented results for one NCS area. Since 2006, NCS has expanded the study of potential bias due to non-response to several additional survey areas and time periods. In this paper, we present results from this additional research. We include localities of different size and with different levels of non-response. Also we compare the direction and magnitude of bias across time and across areas...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{some work}} currently in progress at the Institute for Social Research at Swinburne University of Technology. The study forms {{part of an}} Australian Research Council Linkage Project being undertaken by Swinburne {{in partnership with the}} Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The objective of the Linkage project is to improve the design and management of census operations in Australia, using methods drawn from the disciplines of Statistics and Information Technology. It will do this by developing a statistical model that can explain patterns <b>of</b> response and <b>non-response</b> in the 2006 census, and predict patterns of response that appear in 2011. Of particular interest to the project are localities where the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> ‘dwelling non-response’ – a concept defined in Section 2 of this paper – is high compared to others in their state. The research undertaken in the Linkage project is {{the first of its kind}} in Australia. While some information about ‘undercount’ – another concept defined in Section 2 – is provided in ABS publications, there has been no detailed analysis of the ways in which <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-response</b> to the census are related to other factors such as demographic characteristics, socio-economic measures or location. Investigation of these questions is happening progressively as the project proceeds. No findings from this work have as yet been published. After early analysis identified unexpectedly high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> dwelling <b>non-response</b> in inner-city areas in Melbourne and in other states, the Institute for Social Research was contracted to do a qualitative study to find out why this might be so.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} non-response {{in a large}} government survey. The {{response rate}} for the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) has been below 60 percent {{for the first two}} years of its existence, raising questions about whether the results can be generalized to the target population. The paper begins with an analysis of the types of non-response encountered in the ATUS. We find that non-contact accounts for roughly 60 percent of ATUS non-response, with refusals accounting for roughly 40 percent. Next, we examine two hypotheses about the causes of this non-response. We find little support for the hypothesis that busy people are less likely to respond to the ATUS, but considerable support for the hypothesis that people who are weakly integrated into their communities are less likely to respond, mostly because they are less likely to be contacted. Finally, we compare aggregate estimates of time use calculated using the ATUS base weights without any adjustment for non-response to estimates calculated using the ATUS final weights with a non-response adjustment and to estimates calculated using weights that incorporate our own non-response adjustments based on a propensity model. While there are some modest differences, the three sets of estimates are broadly similar. The paper ends with a discussion of survey design features, their effect on the types and <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-response,</b> and the tradeoffs associated with different design choices. ...|$|E
40|$|Aim The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the way teachers and students of the fifth through eighth grade of the Dutch education system in regular primary schools integrate online media and whether their assessment of this new technology in the classroom differ from each other. The study specifies this integration in to four different school subjects, namely Mathematics, Grammar, Geography and Vocabulary. Method A number of 83 participants spread over several primary schools in the Netherlands, selected by a convenience sample, filled in an online survey. An independent samples t-test was used to analyze the results and compare teachers and students with each other. Results The results showed that using computers was favored both by students and by teachers. The teachers reported a significant higher score about the use of online media within Vocabulary and Geography than the students. We have found significant differences between the students and teachers within the subjects Mathematics and Spelling. Conclusion Our findings indicate that the new technologies are integrated for all the four schools subjects as a teaching/learning tool. However, the liability of this study is questionable due to several issues such as a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-response</b> to the survey; a small sample and the fact that the instrument was put together for the purposes of this study, but it is not a validated survey. An experimental study is recommended for further investigation...|$|E
40|$|The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI- 20) {{scale is}} widely used for {{measuring}} fatigue in cancer care. This questionnaire has been translated into Swedish and used in Swedish cancer populations, and {{the aim of this}} study was to test the validity and reliability of the Swedish version in four populations, with a total of 584 patients. The participants were classified into four groups: palliative cancer patients, cancer patients receiving radiation therapy, non- cancer outpatients, and a group of hospital staff. The MFI- 20 consists of five subscales of fatigue: General Fatigue (GF), Physical Fatigue (PF), Reduced Motivation (RM), Reduced Activity (RA) and Mental Fatigue (MF). We have tested the convergent validity of the MFI- 20 using the Category Ratio instrument (CR- 10). The validity and the reliability of MFI- 20 were acceptable. All subscales of the MFI- 20 were correlated, and all were also correlated with the CR- 10 score (p 5 / 0. 001). General Fatigue was highly correlated with Physical Fatigue for the three patient groups, but this was not the fact for healthy staff. Deleting some items increased Cronbach’s a of the subscale to which these items belonged (where a measures the reliability of the results). The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-response</b> was low (less than 1. 2 %) and there was no pattern to the items omitted.

This finding challenged the view, supported over decades by studies in Australia and elsewhere, that people of higher socio-economic status {{are more likely than}} others to participate in civic activities such as the census. Measures of socio-economic status rely heavily on indices of education and occupation, which may be taken as proxy measures for being ‘well-informed’. The pattern identified in the 2006 census raises what would be for the Australian Bureau of Statistics the unwelcome possibility that the more we know about the census, the less likely we are to complete it.

It begins by defining some key concepts and outlining a model for thinking about non-participation in the census, then discusses some ideas about non-participation as it relates to questions of trust.

40|$|Abstract Background Severely {{disabling}} {{chronic pain}} in the adult population is strongly associated {{with a range of}} negative health consequences for individuals and high health care costs, yet its prevalence in young adults is less clear. Methods All adults aged 18 – 25 years old registered with three general practices in North Staffordshire were invited to complete a postal questionnaire containing questions on pain within the last 6 months, pain location and duration. Severity of chronic pain was assessed by the Chronic Pain Grade. Severely disabling chronic pain was defined as pain within the last six months that had lasted for three months or more and was highly disabling-severely limiting (Grade IV). Results 858 responses from 2, 389 were received (adjusted response = 37. 0 %). The prevalence of any pain within the previous six months was 66. 9 % (95 %CI: 63. 7 %, 70. 1 %). Chronic pain was reported by 14. 3 % (95 %CI: 12. 0 %, 16. 8 %) of respondents with severely disabling chronic pain affecting 3. 0 % (95 %CI: 2. 0 %, 4. 4 %) of this population. Late responders were very similar to early responders in their prevalence of pain. Cross-checking the practice register against the electoral roll suggested register inaccuracies contributed to non-response. Conclusion Pain is a common phenomenon encountered by young adults, affecting 66. 9 % of this study population. Previously observed age-related trends in severely disabling chronic pain in older adults extend to younger adults. Although a small minority of younger adults are affected, they are likely to represent a group with particularly high health care needs. High <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-response</b> in the present study means that these estimates should be interpreted cautiously although there was no evidence <b>of</b> <b>non-response</b> bias. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Self-administered {{questionnaires}} {{are becoming}} increasingly common in general practice. Much research has explored methods to increase response rates but comparatively few studies have explored the effect of questionnaire administration on reported answers. Methods The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effect on responses of returning patient questionnaires to the respondents' medical practice or an independent researcher to questions relating to adherence and satisfaction with a GP consultation. One medical practice in Waveney primary care trust, Suffolk, England participated in this randomised trial. Patients over 18 years initiated on a new long-term medication during a consultation with a GP were randomly allocated to return a survey from their medical practice to either their medical practice or an independent researcher. The main outcome measures were self reported adherence, satisfaction with information about the newly prescribed medicine, the consultation and involvement in discussions. Results 274 (47 %) patients responded to the questionnaire (45 % medical practice, 48 % independent researcher (95 % CI - 5 to 11 %, p = 0. 46)) and the groups appeared demographically comparable, although the high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-response</b> limits the ability to assess this. There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to total adherence or any of the satisfaction scales. Five (4 %) patients reported altering doses of medication in the medical practice group compared with 18 (13 %) in the researcher group (P = 0. 009, Fisher's exact test). More patients in the medical practice group reported difficulties using their medication compared to the researcher group (46 (35 %) v 30 (21 %); p = 0. 015, Fisher's exact test). Conclusion Postal satisfaction questionnaires do not appear to be affected by whether they are returned to the patient's own medical practice or an independent researcher. However, returning postal questionnaires relating to detailed patient behaviours may be subject to response biases and further work is needed to explore this phenomena. </p...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MCur (Nursing Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2008. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the knowledge of Universal Precautions Policy by Registered Nurses at Kenyatta National Hospital (Kenya) and their perception of occupational risk of exposure to blood-borne pathogens. The study also assessed management of blood and body fluids of patients and identified the types and frequency of occupational exposure common among these Registered Nurses. A structured 24 -item, self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 185 randomly sampled Registered Nurses in selected departments at this hospital. Compliance with Universal Precautions practices was also observed using a checklist. Data analysis was done by use of a computer software package, Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 11. 0. The study findings suggest: 1) lack of continuous education demonstrated by a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-response</b> about knowledge of Universal Precautions Policy with only 19 % of the respondents having attended an in-service course in Universal Precautions Policy, and 2) inaccurate understanding of transmission modes of blood-borne pathogens. The majority of nurses surveyed were using Universal Precautions; with indications that nurses were not as familiar with Universal Precautions as they think they were. Respondents admitted modifying personal protection habits based on subjective judgment regarding patient’s perceived blood-borne infectious state. Non-compliant behaviours with barrier precautions were identified, which included failure to use gloves, gowns and protective eyewear, failure to wash hands, and recapping used needles. Compliance with barrier precautions was associated with patients’ perceived blood-borne status. The study revealed a high level of occupational exposures, of which the majority went unreported. Although respondents were aware of the risk of occupationally acquired blood-borne infections, their irregular practice of Universal Precautions Policy is likely to perpetuate the risks. The findings suggest a need for more educational interventions, which may result into integration of concepts into practice. Educational programmes should focus on the epidemiology of occupationally acquired blood-borne pathogens and their modes of transmission, risk of occupationally acquired blood-borne infections at work place, and with emphasis on the principle and practice of Universal Precautions Policy and current protocol of reporting mechanisms in Kenya...|$|E

Methods 131 447 patients who underwent a hip or knee replacement, hernia repair or varicose vein surgery in 2009 - 10 in England. Multivariable logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios <b>of</b> <b>non-response</b> for characteristics <b>of</b> the patients and organisational characteristics of providers. Multiple imputation was used for missing patient characteristics. Providers were included as random effects. Results Response rates to the post-operative questionnaire were 85. 1 % for hip replacement (n = 37 961), 85. 3 % for knee replacements (n = 44 422), 72. 9 % for hernia repair (n = 34 964), and 64. 8 % for varicose vein surgery (n = 14 100). Across the four procedures, there were higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-response</b> in men (odds ratios 1. 03 [95 % CI 0. 95 - 1. 11] - 1. 35 [1. 25 - 1. 46]), younger patients (those under 55 years 3. 01 [2. 72 - 3. 32] - 6. 05 [5. 49 - 6. 67]), non-white patients (1. 24 [1. 11 - 1. 38] - 2. 08 [1. 89 - 2. 31]), patients in the most deprived quintile of socio-economic status (1. 47 [1. 34 - 1, 62] - 1. 86 [1. 71 - 2. 03]), those who lived alone (1. 11 [0. 99 - 1. 23] - 1. 27 [1. 18 - 1. 36]) {{and those who had}} been assisted when completing their pre-operative questionnaire (1. 26 [1. 10 - 1. 46] - 1. 67 [1. 56 - 1. 79]). Non-response rates were also higher in patients who had poorer pre-operative health (three or more comorbidities: 1. 14 [0. 96 - 1. 35] - 1. 45 [1. 30 - 1. 63]). Providers' patient recruitment rates before surgery and the timing of pre-operative questionnaire administration did not affect the rates of response to post-operative questionnaires. Conclusion If non-response can be shown to be associated with outcome, then rates <b>of</b> <b>non-response</b> to post-operative questionnaires would need {{to be taken into account}} when these measures are being used to compare the performance of providers or to evaluate surgical procedures. </p...|$|R

We argue that the large literature on measuring incomes has not devoted enough attention to ‘single-question’ surveys.

(1, 2) With past treatment regimens including interferon monotherapy or the combination of standard interferon with ribavirin, patients who remained HCV RNA positive by qualitative testing by RT-PCR after 12 or 24 weeks, respectively, had little or no chance of achieving a sustained virologic response (SVR). (3, 4) Preliminary data from one of the PEG-R studies suggested that the most appropriate time point for assessing response with the current regimen was also 24 weeks. (1).

30|$|Our {{estimates}} {{are consistent with}} previous studies that proposed survey non-response {{as a measure of}} non-cognitive skills. As in Hedengren and Stratmann (2012) and Hitt et al. (2016) the ratio of “don’t know” answers in the questionnaire is negatively associated with individual earnings. When not controlling for PIAAC scores and <b>level</b> <b>of</b> education, we find that one standard deviation in questionnaire non-response, is associated with 8.54 % lower earnings. We complement the findings of Hedengren and Stratmann (2012) and Hitt et al. (2016) by showing that this result is robust to controlling for PIAAC test scores. When controlling for PIAAC scores and <b>level</b> <b>of</b> education, one standard deviation in questionnaire non-response, is associated with a 3.58 % reduction in earnings. We also see that the different types <b>of</b> <b>non-response,</b> i.e., “don’t know” and “refused to answer”, have opposite effects (also when included in separate regressions), even though the proportion of “refused to answer” is not significantly correlated with earnings. The existence of differences in the “refused” and “don’t know” categories <b>of</b> <b>non-response</b> has been emphasized by Riphahn and Serfling (2005) and Shoemaker et al. (2002). If we collapse the two measures in a single variable <b>of</b> <b>non-response,</b> the results are similar to the ones obtained for “don’t know” answers. 16 Thus, consistently with Hedengren and Stratmann (2012) and Hitt et al.

Moreover, our results suggests that this relationship is exclusively driven by a specific type of non-response: “don’t know” answers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background International {{health policy}} surveys {{are used to}} compare and {{evaluate}} health system performance, but {{little is known about}} the effects <b>of</b> <b>non-response.</b> The objective <b>of</b> this study was to assess the effects <b>of</b> <b>non-response</b> in the Norwegian part of the Commonwealth Fund international health policy survey in 2009. Methods As part of an international health policy survey in 2009 a cross-sectional survey was conducted in Norway among a representative sample of Norwegian general practitioners. 1 400 randomly selected GPs were sent a postal questionnaire including questions about the Norwegian health care system, the quality of the GPs' own practice and the cooperation with specialist health care. The survey included three postal reminders and a telephone follow-up of postal non-respondents. The main outcome measures were increase in response rate for each reminder, the effects of demographic and practice variables on response, the effects <b>of</b> <b>non-response</b> on survey estimates, and the cost-effectiveness of each reminder. Results After three postal reminders and one telephone follow-up, the response rate was 59. 1 %. Statistically significant differences between respondents and non-respondents were found for three variables; group vs. solo practice (p = 0. 01), being a specialist or not (p Conclusions The response rate in the Norwegian survey was satisfactory, and the effect <b>of</b> <b>non-response</b> was small indicating adequate representativeness. The cost-effectiveness of the final reminders was poor. The Norwegian findings strengthen the international project, but restrictions in generalizability warrant further study in other countries. </p...|$|R
40|$|The effects <b>of</b> unit <b>non-response</b> on survey {{errors are}} {{of great concern}} to researchers. However, direct {{assessment}} <b>of</b> <b>non-response</b> bias in survey estimates is rarely possible. Attempts are often made to adjust for the effects <b>of</b> <b>non-response</b> by weighting, but this usually relies {{on the use of}} frame data or external population data, which are at best modestly correlated with the survey variables. This paper reports the development of a method to collect limited survey data from non-respondents to personal interview surveys and a large-scale field test of the method on the British Crime Survey (BCS). The method is shown to be acceptable and low cost, to provide valid data, and to have no detrimental effect on the main survey. The use of the resultant data to estimate non-response bias is illustrated and some substantive conclusions are drawn for the BCS...|$|R
40|$|Mortality rates {{computed}} from data {{reported in the}} British Household Panel Survey are lower than those {{computed from}} registration of deaths; {{the main source of}} this error {{is likely to be a}} failure to distinguish non-response due to unreported death from other forms <b>of</b> <b>non-response.</b> Here we model the interaction between state of health, mortality and <b>non-response</b> <b>of</b> men aged 65 and over in a trivariate probit model so as to correct for non-response. We then explore whether the restrictions on the model coefficients required to produce the observed aggregate mortality rates can be accepted statistically. We find that the required restrictions are rejected suggesting that the standard treatment <b>of</b> <b>non-response</b> does not fully address the problem. A possible explanation is that the original sample is not fully representative of the population...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Treatment Resistant-Depression (TRD), {{known as}} the failure to respond to at least two {{different}} adequate trials of antidepressant treatments (ADT) in the current episode, is a relatively frequent clinical condition, associated to {{a high number of}} relapses, hospitalizations, and an elevated use of multiple pharmacological treatments. To date, however, the association between clinical variables and non-response in {TRD} remains unclear. Objectives To identify predictors <b>of</b> <b>non-response</b> in inpatients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and TRD. Aims To investigate clinical variables as potential predictors <b>of</b> <b>non-response</b> in TRD. Methods Two hundred fifty-three inpatients with {MDD} and {TRD} were divided into two groups: responders and non-responders to drug therapies, according to a decrease of 50...|$|R
