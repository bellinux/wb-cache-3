40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{laminated}} concept for {{indium tin oxide}} (ITO) -free organic solar cells (OSC). This concept omits the need of electrode deposition on top of organic layers and thus gives freedom of choice for the electrodes and the corresponding deposition techniques to achieve the best ratio between material consumption and electrical/optical properties. Various <b>lamination</b> <b>processes</b> have already been conducted on organic solar cells, mainly hot press lamination in which the lamination is done under high pressure in preheated conditions for several minutes. Here a new concept is presented where the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) flexible foils with organic layers are laminated {{without the use of}} high pressure and/or temperature and are just passed through simple lamination rolls. This use of simple lamination rolls and elimination of high pressure and temperature during lamination makes this concept a significant step closer to roll to roll (R 2 R) compatible. Furthermore the transparent contact was formed by a silver (Ag) grid and highly conductive Poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) to replace ITO. To our best knowledge, this is the first ITO-free laminated concept on flexible foils which additionally eliminates the use of high pressure lamination. For a laminated organic solar cell with poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) : (6, 6) -phenyl C 61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as photoactive layer, experimental results have shown a device efficiency of 2. 5 % on an active area of 1. 1 cm 2 which is more than 80 % of the reference device efficiency with similar device architecture on a single substrate...|$|R

40|$|The coating {{technology}} is a strategic solution to improve the properties of flexible packaging films. Indeed, additional functional layers are often designed and added as coating on the substrate, {{in order to improve}} the characteristic of the flexible packaging and to meet the requirements for the desired gas or vapour barrier, for adhesion and sealing, or for improving the film printability, its aesthetics and durability. Moreover, this technology allows to functionalize a polymeric substrate applying materials with different chemistry, rheology, thermal and structural characteristics. BOPET films are widely used for food packaging applications thanks to their good gas barrier and mechanical properties, high transparency and for the excellent printability. In regard to sealing performance, BOPET films show poor sealing properties so they are mostly submitted to <b>lamination</b> <b>processes</b> with polyethylene. Nevertheless, this solution compromises the PET recyclability and influences the gas permeability of the multilayer PET based structures. The aim of this work is to investigate on the effect of nanocomposite biodegradable coatings for BOPET substrates in enhancing the heat sealing strength of eco-compatible PET/PLA films. At this regards, different percentages of Cloisite C 30 B (0 %, 2 % and 4 %wt/wt) have been added to PLA by solution intercalation technique and the nanocomposite biodegradable materials produced have been applied on BOPET commercial films by casting. The BOPET coated films have been characterized in order to evaluate the heat sealing strength and the mechanical, gas permeability and surface properties. The results have shown that the addition of nanoclay in PLA coating significantly enhance the hot tack properties of the PET/PLA system produced, while the oxygen and water vapour permeability are slightly increased if compared to pure BOPET films...|$|R

Multivariate data analysis has been employed for both {{qualitative and quantitative}} applications. ^ Three applications of fiber optics in near- and mid-infrared spectroscopy have been investigated. The fiber optics were used both as a waveguide to transmit light from and to a spectrometer and as an intrinsic element of a sensor. Evanescent wave absorption (attenuated total reflection ATR) spectra in near- and mid-infrared regions were used for detection. (1) A pH sensor was constructed with silica fiber by immobilizing a conductive polymer onto {{the core of the}} fiber. The evanescent wave spectrum of the conductive polymer in the 1100 - 1450 nm region was used to monitor the effect of pH. Non-linear P-matrix regression of the absorbance at 1428 nm was used for pH prediction. (2) ATR and bio-glucose sensors in the mid-IR region were made from chalcogenide fibers. The ATR sensor used the fiber core to measure the evanescent wave spectra of glucose samples; the biosensor was constructed by immobilizing a glucose oxidase on the core of the fiber. Results from two sensors were very similar. (3) A chalcogenide fiber was also used to monitor <b>lamination</b> <b>processes</b> in an autoclave.

5000|$|... "Laminated" [...] or [...] "engineered" [...] logs are a {{different}} approach to log-house building. Full trees or (alternatively) sawn cants (unfinished logs to be further processed) are brought to a mill with a dry kiln, the bark is removed and the trees are sawn into boards usually no more than two inches thick. These boards are then taken to the dry kiln, where (because of their size) they can be dried without causing severe damage to the wood. Timber destined for glue lamination must be brought down below 15% moisture before the <b>lamination</b> <b>process</b> will work, so typically these timbers are dried to around 8-10% moisture. The drying process varies on the species of lumber, but can be done in as little as a week. Once the drying process is complete the planks are sent through a surfacer (or planer), which makes the face of the lumber perfectly smooth. These planks travel to a machine, which then spreads a special glue on the interior boards. Depending on the type of glue and type of mill, {{there are two ways to}} finish the <b>lamination</b> <b>process.</b> One type of glue reacts with radio-frequency (RF) energy to cure the glue in minutes; the other uses a high-pressure clamp, which holds the newly reassembled timbers under pressure for 24 hours. Once the glue has dried, the result is a [...] "log cant" [...] that is slightly larger than the buyer's desired profile. These log cants are run through a profiler, and the end result is a log that is perfectly straight and uniform. Some mills are capable of joining together small timbers by using a combination of face and edge gluing and a process known as finger- jointing.

Variables studied included fiber type, matrix toughness, <b>lamination</b> manufacturing <b>process,</b> and intraply hybridization. The laminates found to have the lowest notch sensitivity were manufactured using automated tow placement.

Laminates with the highest notch sensitivity consisted of toughened matrix materials that were resistant to a splitting phenomena that reduces stress concentrations in load bearing plies. Parameters for conventional fracture criteria were found to increase with the crack length of the smallest notch sizes studied. Most materials and laminate combinations followed less than a square root singularity for the largest crack sizes studied.

40|$|The {{constant}} {{drive to}} further miniaturization and heterogeneous system integration {{leads to a}} need for new packaging technologies which also allow large area processing and 3 D integration with potential for low cost applications. Large area mold embedding technologies and embedding of active components into printed circuit boards (Chip-inPolymer) are two major packaging trends in this area. Mold embedding is currently done on wafer level, typically with diameters of 8 " to 12 ", for future process optimization, PCB technologies offer the potential of real large areas up to 610 × 457 mm 2. For mold embedding as e. g. for fan-out wafer level packaging compression molding equipment is used in combination with liquid, granular or sheet epoxy molding compounds, with the boundary condition, that mold processes do need a product specific tool (with defined diameter & thickness). Within this paper the potential of tool-less <b>lamination</b> <b>processes,</b> a standard in PCB manufacturing, is evaluated. Lamination is done in panel format using well-known molding compounds from wafer level compression molding. To evaluate the potential of today's encapsulants for large area embedding processes, different liquid, granular and sheet molding compounds have been intensively evaluated on their processability, on process & material induced die shift and on resulting warpage - all on panel level. Acting as an interconnection layer, PCB based redistribution technologies using lamination of resin coated copper (RCC) films are used. Within the paper, different RCC materials are introduced and discussed concerning their reliability potential based on the available layer thicknesses and thermo-mechanical material properties. The feasibility of the proposed technologies is demonstrated using a two chip package. Dies are embedded in panel size by lamination technologies. Subsequently the wiring is done by lamination of an RCC film over the embedded cmponents and on the panel backside for double sided redistribution. In a process flow also similar to conventional PCB manufacturing µvias to the die pads and through mold vias are drilled using a UV laser and are metalized by Cu-electroplating in one step. This way dies {{are connected to the}} front copper layer as well as front to backside of the panel. Conductor lines and pads are formed by Cu etching. Finally, a solder mask and a solderable surface finish are applied. If solder depots are necessary, e. g. for BGA packages, those can be applied by solder balling equipment - either by printing or by preform attach. In summary this paper describes the potential to move from wafer level to panel level mold embedding technology in combination with PCB based redistribution processes. The technology described offers a cost effective packaging solution for e. g. single chip packages as well as for future sensor/ASIC systems or processor/memory stacks in volume production...|$|R
