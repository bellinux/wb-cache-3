[...] Christopher John Farley of Time called it a [...] "richly imagined CD". Mark Anthony Neal of PopMatters called it [...] "the working blueprint for 'post-Soul' black pop".

5000|$|Critical {{reaction}} to Forever was mixed to positive. In an extremely positive {{review of the}} album, Matt Collar of Allmusic said: The debut full-length album from Los Angeles' Mystery Skulls, 2014's Forever, showcases the group's infectious, '80s-influenced disco, R&B, and dance-oriented soul. Primarily centered around the talents of lead singer, songwriter, and musical mastermind Luis Dubuc, Mystery Skulls make pulsing, laser-toned R&B that touches upon vintage '70s and '80s club music {{as much as it}} does contemporary R&B, techno, and EDM. In that sense, cuts like [...] "The Future," [...] "Fantasy," [...] and [...] "Forever" [...] fit just as nicely alongside cuts by Daft Punk and Grum as they do tracks from such similarly inclined artists as Sam Sparro and Justin Timberlake. What helps set Mystery Skulls apart {{from the rest of the}} electro-R&B pack is Dubuc's lithe vocal abilities. Blessed with soulful phrasing, a burnished middle vocal range, and a knack for ascending into a lusty falsetto croon, Dubuc comes across as less the pulsating center of a robotic hive mind, à la Daft Punk, and more <b>like</b> <b>an</b> improbable <b>cross</b> <b>between</b> Fall Out Boy's Patrick Stump and '90s R&B prodigal son D'Angelo. It also doesn't hurt the album, or Dubuc's cred for that matter, that he's joined here on [...] "Magic" [...] and [...] "Number 1" [...] by both Chic guitar legend Nile Rodgers and '90s soul diva Brandy. Musically, while most of the songs on Forever are set to deep programmed grooves and heavy synth basslines, Dubuc nonetheless strikes an even balance between his use of synthesizer (his main instrument), real piano, drums, and orchestral strings. Ultimately, it's this sophisticated balance that helps Forever sound both organic and computerized, warmly familiar, and utterly fresh.|$|R
