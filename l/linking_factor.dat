40|$|Object Oriented Databases (OODB) is {{becoming}} popular {{day by day}} and being used in {{a large number of}} application domains. In order to support homogeneous distributed OODBs a clear understanding of partitioning of class and how to do it by using different partitioning algorithms is needed. In this paper an algorithm for vertical fragmentation in a model consisting of class and comprising of complex attributes and complex methods is presented. The approach for fragmentation is top-down and entity of fragmentation is class. The algorithm presented here is an enhancement to the previous work of vertical partitioning algorithms in OODB management systems. The algorithm takes input as the class to be partitioned into fragments or groups, generates Method Usage Matrix as its first step from the methods and queries provided. It then generates Method Affinity matrix which is constructed using above matrix and based on method affinity values of two methods. Two new factors are introduced Method <b>Linking</b> <b>Factor</b> and Group <b>Linking</b> <b>Factor</b> which provides more control on deciding groups and increasing the flexibility of the algorithm...|$|E

Based on these three factors a model of free ports was designed with a typology of thirteen types of free ports, an explanation of their evolution, and their future prospects.|$|E

The ‘trigger’ of cross-border movement has been weakened to some extent in the identity cases, and others such as Carpenter.

40|$|This article {{provides}} an empirical {{investigation of the}} causal relationship between the current account (CA) and the capital account (KA) {{in the case of}} Indian economy.

Furthermore, we examine the causal relations between the components of the KA and the CA along with exchange rate as the <b>linking</b> <b>factor</b> between them. The causal findings, in the above mentioned case, show different results. Our finding suggests that there exist a causal relationship from Nondebt flows to the CA via the real effective exchange rate. This implies that decomposition of the KA helps in identifying the source of flows that drives the CA the most. The results also indicate that volatile capital flows may deteriorate the CA balance and therefore, emphasis should be laid on improving the soundness of the financial sector before moving towards the full KA convertibility...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} conceptually correct {{tests of}} the Heckscher-Ohlin proposition that trade in commodities can be {{explained in terms of}} an interaction between factor input requirements and factor endowments. Most prior work that claims top resent tests of this hypothesis have used intuitive but inappropriate generalizations of the traditional two by two model to deal with a multidimensional reality. Moreover, prior work has in general used measurements on only two of the three variables(trade, factor input requirements and factor endowments) that are required for a proper test of the H-O theory. We derive an exact specification of the H-O interaction in a multicountry, multicommodity, multifactor world {{in the form of the}} Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek (H-O-V) theorem which equates the factors embodied in net trade to excess factor supplies. This theorem implies sign and rank propositions analogous to those implicitly studied by Leontief, but it also implies hypotheses about the parameters <b>linking</b> <b>factor</b> contents and factor supplies. Accordingly, we conduct {{tests of the}} sign and rank propositions as well as several parametric hypotheses which permit various assumptions about measurement errors, nonproportional consumption and technological differences. Our analysis uses separately measured data on trade, factor input requirements and endowments for twenty-seven countries and twelve factors in 1967. Tests of the Leontief type sign and rank propositions sharply reject this facet of the H-O-V model. In particular, the sign of net factor exports infrequently predicts the sign of excess factor supplies and therefore does not systematically reveal factor abundance. The results from an extended set of tests conducted in a regression context reject the H-O-V hypothesis of an exact relationship between factor contents and national factor supplies. Support is found for the H-O [...] V assumption of homothetic preferences, but estimates of the parameters <b>linking</b> <b>factor</b> contents and factor supplies are found to differ significantly from their theoretical values. We find there is clear evidence that the departure of the estimated coefficients from their theoretical values is importantly related to differences across countries in the matrix of factor input requirements and, by implication, to violation of the assumption of factor price equalization. We also find that errors of measurement in both trade and national factor supplies are an important reason for rejection of the H-O-V hypothesis. ...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} resistance and endurance training on muscle proteome expression, samples of vastus lateralis from 10 physically active young men were analysed by 2 -dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Differential patterns of protein expression were determined after 4 weeks of endurance or resistance exercise training. Following endurance exercise training, carbonic anhydrase III immunoglobulin heavy chain, myosin heavy chain 1, titin, chromosome 12, and fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphatase 2 were up-regulated while pyruvate kinase 3 isoform, ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase, and phosphoglucomutase were down-regulated. After the 4 weeks of resistance exercise training, five proteins, apolipoprotein A-IV precursor, microtubule-actin cross <b>linking</b> <b>factor</b> 1, myosin light chain, growth hormone inducible transmembrane protein, and an unknown protein were up-regulated and pyruvate kinase 3 isoform, human albumin, and enolase 3 were down-regulated.

Proteomic studies represent one of the developing techniques of metabolism which may substantially contribute to new insights into muscle and exercise physiology...|$|E
40|$|Firm {{dynamics}} {{are commonly}} explained through learning processes by evolutionary economics and resource-based {{theories of the}} firm. The literature, however, also highlights the methodological difficulty to unpack learning. With the support of cognitive-behavioural theories of learning {{and the use of}} a multi-method approach, this study investigates the evolution of business start- ups and interactions between markets, institutions and learning strategies. In retrospective interviews, entrepreneurs-founders of 43 Brazilian start-ups reconstructed the storyline of the first three to five years of their firms, focussing on critical learning episodes. Analyses of the narratives resulted in 207 critical learning episodes, based on the analytical framework, empirical content, expert evaluation and the literature. These episodes were clustered in five categories. Quantitative descriptive analysis showed the cross-cutting dynamics of these episodes. Then, relationships between episodes were investigated through grounded theory principles. Results showed that the key <b>linking</b> <b>factor</b> between episodes is the resource-base of each episode, which generated five typical pathways. The final step identified the properties of these pathways. It is argued that the iteration between qualitative and quantitative methods was crucial to unpack the relationships described. This study provides a viable methodology and a comprehensive framework to investigate the evolution of business start-ups, contributing to the literature on organizational learning, entrepreneurship, and theory of the firm...|$|E
