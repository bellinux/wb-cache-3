500|$|Ham Mills was {{a site of}} milling {{activity}} from mediaeval times until about 1914. The mill was situated on {{an island in the}} middle of the river, with a weir and bypass channel to the north and the <b>lock</b> <b>channel</b> to the south. The Conservators were required to light the area after a boatman fell into the river and drowned while attempting to use the lock after dark in March 1826. The coroner who instructed that the lighting should be installed noted that [...] "boats were passing at all hours of the night." [...] Water levels in the river fell as more water was extracted further upstream, and by the 1890s the waterwheels were assisted by a steam-driven turbine which the miller installed. Milling ceased in 1914, when the boiler which supplied the steam was removed by the War Department, so that it could be fitted into a minesweeper. A surviving mill house which dates from the early 19th century has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building.|$|E

50|$|In June 1919, {{the colonial}} {{authorities}} awarded the {{contract for the}} Causeway’s construction to Topham, Jones & Railton, a London-based engineering firm.

Construction started at the Johor end of the straits, where the <b>lock</b> <b>channel</b> was to be located, in order to minimise disruption to existing ferry services. The quarry on Pulau Ubin was reopened to supply rubble and crushed stone, and the granite supply was later boosted by stone from the Bukit Timah quarry.|$|E

It would also include a <b>lock</b> <b>channel</b> that allowed the passage of small vessels, an electric lift-bridge, water pipelines and floodgates to manage the water flow of the straits.

50|$|The {{original}} {{entrance to}} the docks is 80 ft wide, with two wrought-iron gates operated by direct acting hydraulic cylinders.This sea entrance leads into the Basin, (rarely called No.3 dock), that is 600 by 500 ft and covers 7 acre. At its north-west end, the Basin is connected to No.1 dock by an 80 ft wide passage with another pair of wrought iron lock gates, so that when required, the Basin {{can act as a}} lock, with the water level adjusted according to the rising tide, so wide-beamed vessels can leave the basin before high water and can enter the basin after high water.

They are 50 ft high, 17 ft thick at the base just above the curve, and 7 ft thick at the top. They rest on solid rock.The Basin gates contain many sluices, so water can be quickly drained out or let in according to whether the sea level is above or below the prevailing docks water level but more water is lost from No.1 dock supply if the Basin water is lowered to the seaward side of the lock gates instead of using the Lady Windsor lock sluices. In the early days, the dock operators would often run the water down to bring in a single ship having a wider beam than the Lady Windsor lock could handle.|$|E

40|$|Migrating {{fish that}} swim {{upstream}} in rivers for reproduction need to overcome obstructions, such as hydropower plants. If a fishway {{is used to}} help the fish pass such an obstacle, water {{needs to be taken}} from the dam without first passing through the turbines. Also, the fish may have difficulties finding the fishway, due to the dominating flow from the turbine tailrace. A fish lock that uses turbine tailwater to entice the fish into the lock and further on to a fishway is studied. The fish lock is a shallow open channel that uses {{a small fraction of the}} tailwater. A local acceleration of the flow is created by changing the cross sectional area of the <b>lock</b> <b>channel.</b> Measurements are concentrated on how to design the lock so enough water passes through and a sufficient velocity increment is reached.

The summit level, above Bosley Locks, was constructed at an elevation of , on a level with the Peak Forest Canal. At Bosley, twelve locks dropped the level to almost that of the Trent and Mersey, {{but there is a}} stop lock at the junction with their Hall Green Branch, with a fall of just , which ensured that the Trent and Mersey did not lose any water to the new canal. When originally built, the chamber was very long, and both companies installed a set of lock gates, enabling them both to collect tolls. Each company built a cottage overlooking the locks, the Macclesfield Canal constructing theirs of stone, while the Trent and Mersey used brick. A long overflow above the <b>locks</b> <b>channels</b> surplus water to the Trent and Mersey Canal, as stipulated by the amendment to the 1827 Act.
