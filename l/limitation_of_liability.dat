25|$|According to Vivendi Universal Games, the {{distribution}} contract they signed with Valve included cyber cafés. This {{would mean that}} only Vivendi Universal Games could distribute Half-Life 2 to cyber cafés— not Valve through the Steam system. On November 29, 2004, Judge Thomas S. Zilly, of U.S. Federal District Court in Seattle, Washington, ruled that Vivendi Universal Games and its affiliates are not authorized to distribute (directly or indirectly) Valve games through cyber cafés to end users for pay-to-play activities pursuant to the parties' current publishing agreement. In addition, Judge Zilly {{ruled in favor of}} the Valve motion regarding the contractual <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability,</b> allowing Valve to recover copyright damages for any infringement as allowed by law without regard to the publishing agreement's <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clause.|$|E

25|$|The loss of {{the ship}} was subject of a lawsuit filed within weeks of the sinking by {{relatives}} of the crew members seeking 2.5 million dollars in damages under two specific federal acts (the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. § 688; and the Death on the High Seas Act, 46 U.S.C. § 761), based upon maritime laws regarding the unseaworthiness of a vessel. Marine Sulphur Transport Corporation (the owners of the ship), and Marine Transport Lines, Inc. (demise charterer) petitioned for exoneration {{or at least a}} <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability.</b> The amount of damages sought would grow to $20 million by 1969.|$|E
40|$|The {{existing}} monetary <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> {{in international}} private air law are reviewed and compared with limits in other branches of transport law. The reasons submitted to justify monetary <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> in air law are summarized and criticised. A {{comparison of the}} level of limits with statistics and the social requirement to provide full recovery of damages lead {{to the conclusion that the}} limits are inadequate and unrealistically low. The problem of the unit of account in which limits are expressed (gold, SDR) and the idea of freezing the amount of damages recoverable in conventions without self-regulatory clauses are discussed from the perspective of inflation and the current economic situation. Deficiencies in the existing legal solutions in air law are exposed and criticised. In conclusion, a new system of compensation to victims of air crashes breaking away from the existing monetary <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> in air law and based on prevailing aviation insurance market practices is proposed...|$|R

25|$|There was {{a degree}} of public and {{legislative}} distaste for a <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability,</b> with fears that it would cause a drop in standards of probity. The 1855 Act allowed limited liability to companies of more than 25 members (shareholders). Insurance companies {{were excluded from the}} act, though it was standard practice for insurance contracts to exclude action against individual members. Limited liability for insurance companies was allowed by the Companies Act 1862. The minimum number of members necessary for registration as a limited company was reduced to seven by the Companies Act 1856. Limited companies in England and Wales now require only one member.|$|E
25|$|On November 29, 2004, Judge Thomas Samuel Zilly of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington {{ruled in}} favor of Valve. Specifically, the ruling stated that Vivendi Universal and its {{affiliates}} (including Sierra) were not authorized to distribute Valve games, either directly or indirectly, through cyber cafés to end users for pay-to-play activities pursuant to the parties' publishing agreement. In addition, Judge Zilly ruled that Valve could recover copyright damages for infringements without regard to the publishing agreement's <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clause. Valve posted on the Steam website that the two companies had come to a settlement in court on April 29, 2005. Electronic Arts announced on July 18, 2005, that they would be teaming up with Valve in a multi-year deal to distribute their games, replacing Vivendi Universal from then onwards. As a result of the trial, the arbitrator also awarded Valve $2,391,932.|$|E

On 7 November 1961, she {{collided}} with the [...] Norwegian tanker MV Berea in the Houston Ship Channel. As {{a result of the}} collision, Union Reliance caught fire and then ran aground. Twelve people aboard the Union Reliance were killed in the collision and subsequent fire. Union Reliance was abandoned by her owners. The wreck was removed on 9 November by the United States authorities and towed to Galveston, Texas China Union Lines refused to make payment for this, and filed a Petition for Exoneration from, or <b>Limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Liability.</b> The Court ordered that Union Reliance and her cargo be sold to pay off costs incurred by the United States authorities. On 12 January 1962, Union Reliance was sold for US$109,100 for scrap. She was scrapped at New Orleans in March 1962.|$|E

50|$|From a legal standpoint, {{multimodal}} transport creates several problems. Unimodal transports are currently governed by different, often-mandatory international conventions. These conventions stipulate different bases for <b>liability,</b> and different <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> for the carrier. As of 2011, {{the solution to}} this problem has been the so-called network principle. According to the network principle, the different conventions coexist unchanged; the carrier’s liability is defined according to where the breach of contract has occurred (where the goods have been damaged during transport, for example). However, problems arise if the breach of contract is systemic (not localized).|$|R

40|$|Consequential damages {{can easily}} amount to {{millions}} of dollars. Commercial parties often disclaim consequential damages in their contracts. This Article posits that such disclaimers between commercial parties under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) should not be found unenforceable based on gross negligence. Article 2 of the UCC promotes the policy of freedom of contract. Consistent with that policy, section 2 - 719 of the UCC provides that contractual consequential damages disclaimers should be enforceable absent a finding of unconscionability. This Article analyzes the interplay among UCC section 2 - 719, “public policy” exceptions to enforcing <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability,</b> and the law of gross negligence. This Article concludes that but for those rare circumstances in which a commercial buyer may invoke unconscionability, courts should uphold consequential damages disclaimers absent a clear showing of willful misconduct. This standard provides a more discernible “bright-line” that comports with the general treatment of economic losses under the UCC...|$|R

40|$|Home and {{business}} owners increasingly rely on alarm systems {{to protect against}} theft and property damage. When a burglary or fire occurs and an alarm service customer discovers that the alarm company negligently failed {{to call the police}} or fire department, the customer understandably would expect redress for the company’s failure to provide its service. Many customers would be surprised, though, to discover that an alarm company’s liability is often contractually limited to a relatively token amount unrelated to the cost of the service, even when the alarm company is negligent. Some states view these <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> as exculpatory clauses and determine their enforceability based on whether they are unconscionable or violate public policy. Other states view them as liquidated damages and apply a penalty test to determine their enforceability. This Note addresses the differences between these two approaches {{in the context of the}} unique remedy difficulties inherent in alarm service contracts. This Note then argues that the prevailing policy rationales for enforcing alarm service provisions that limit a party’s liability for its own negligence are misguided and advocates that these provisions should not be enforced as a matter of public policy...|$|R
