In 1976, the Progressive Conservatives led by Premier Bill Davis decided to pass amendments to the Environmental Protection Act which would require the gradual phasing out of non-refillable pop <b>containers.</b> The <b>Metal</b> <b>Container</b> Manufacturer’ Advisory Council (MCMAC) stated that if the regulations were implemented there would be a loss of more than 1, 200 jobs in steel can making and capital facilities worth more than $ 50 million owned by companies involved with soft drink can manufacturing would be abandoned. 38 cm, (1 box) containing correspondence, press releases, clippings and publications pertaining to the <b>Metal</b> <b>Containers</b> Manufacturers' Advisory Council...|$|R

40|$|Corrosion of <b>metal</b> canning <b>containers</b> {{is one of}} the {{obstacles}} in spreading its application for packing of food. Particularly aggressive to the <b>metal</b> <b>container</b> is fruit canned medium, containing organic acids. The basic material for the production of <b>metal</b> canning <b>container</b> is white tinplate. The main advantage of white tinplate is the tin compounds are harmless to human organism. For this reason, a white badge is used widely, usually used for production of canning containers, packaging beverages. Despite the fact that recently often used containers made of aluminum badge (foil), the basic material for manufacturing <b>metal</b> canning <b>containers</b> is steel white tinplate. Now applied for coating paints and varnishes do not provide anti-corrosion protection of inner surface of <b>metal</b> <b>containers</b> during storage. Preserving of canned fruit quality in <b>metal</b> <b>containers</b> is largely defined corrosion resistance of the containers. This {{is due to the fact}} that the metal transition to canned fruit in due courses of corrosion processes is lowering the nutritional value and deterioration taste of the product, and while allocation of hydrogen is accompanied by swelling and destruction of <b>metal</b> <b>containers.</b> We have investigated a number of anti-corrosion coatings based on Fe-Cr and Fe-Sn-Ti of their behavior in aggressive mediums canned fruit. For the purpose of modeling such mediums the solutions of most widespread organic acids were used. The research allowed conclude, that in surface solid solutions Fe-Sn-Ti increase the corrosion resistance of carbon steel in aqueous solutions of malic, citric and tartaric acids. This implies that the surface solid solutions’ formation can significantly improve corrosion resistance in aggressive canning mediums. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} a study to develop a standard fire test for 5 -gal containers used for storing combustible fluids in underground coal mines. A standard test method was developed which evaluates {{the performance of the}} container in a 4 -min tray fire. Bureau investigators used the standard test method to evaluate several types of closed 5 -gal plastic and metal cans in outdoor tests. Each can tested contained 1 gal of nonfire-resistant (NFR) hydraulic oil. A container failed the test if it lost its contents in any of seven trials. Contents spilled either as a result of thermal rupture or melting. Fewer than 10 pct of the <b>metal</b> <b>containers</b> failed this criterion, but all the plastic <b>containers</b> failed. The <b>metal</b> <b>container</b> failures were usual-ly due to tipping over during pressure relief, which spilled the NFR oil. Replacing the NFR oil in the container with kerosene resulted in failure of more than 30 pct of the <b>metal</b> <b>containers.</b> The standard tests and preliminary tests showed that plastic containers are not equivalent to <b>metal</b> <b>containers</b> in their ability to contain combustibles such as lubricants and greases in a fire. For solvents and lubricants more volatile than NFR hydraulic oil, approved <b>metal</b> safety <b>containers</b> are recommended...|$|R
