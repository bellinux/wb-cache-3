5|$|Timex {{produced}} a second {{version of the}} ZX81 {{in the form of}} the TS1500, essentially an Americanised ZX81 launched in August 1983. It dispensed with the membrane keyboard and used a case similar to that of the ZX Spectrum, incorporating 16 KB of on-board memory. It was effectively a stopgap between the ZX81 and Spectrum. However, it was unsuccessful due to increased competition from rival US machines and the after-effects of Timex's botched marketing of the TS1000. Although the TS1000 had initially been a great success, Timex failed to provide the essential RAM pack upgrades to the market for two or three months after it launched the TS1000. Consumers would take the machine home, plug it in and find that it would not do anything useful due to the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Lawrence {{purchased}} the Commodore PET 2001 {{and no longer}} needed the university's computer. He rewrote DND as Telengard within eight kilobytes of memory. Due {{to a lack of}} space, he designed the dungeon to be procedurally generated based on the player-character's position so the maps would not have to be stored in memory. <b>Lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> was Lawrence's primary design obstacle. Nevertheless, the final version almost completely used 32 kilobytes of memory. It was easily ported to the Apple II+ and TRS-80 platforms due to their similar usage of the 8K BASIC programming language. The later Atari 800 port required a more complicated handling of string variables. The three ports were finished before Avalon Hill saw the game at a gaming convention and licensed it in 1982 as one of its first computer games. The IBM PC port required a rewrite into the C programming language; the source code for this version was later lost. The Heath/Zenith CP/M version requires MBASIC. The game's most popular port was for the Commodore 64.|$|E
500|$|When the {{interview}} ended at 13:35, the doctor {{noted that he}} found Lamb's hour-long maintenance of this seemingly hypomanic behaviour [...] "remarkable". Simulation on Lamb's part was unlikely, Yaworsky believed, and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> credible. The doctor wrote in his report that Lamb had been [...] "suffering from a disease of the mind" [...] {{at the time of}} the shootings, which had caused him to be in a kind of dream world, outside of reality. Standing before the magistrate that same afternoon, Yaworsky testified that Lamb was mentally unsound and not fit to stand trial. The magistrate once again remanded Lamb, this time to custody at Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre for a minimum of 30 days. Lamb was again examined on 29 June 1966, this time by James Dolan, the Clinical Director of Psychiatry at St Thomas Elgin General Hospital.|$|E

500|$|Games for the Master System are in two formats: ROM {{cartridges}} {{are capable}} of holding up to 4 Mbit of game code, while Sega Cards can hold up to 256 kbit. Cards were cheaper to manufacture than the cartridges and included titles such as Spy vs. Spy and Super Tennis, but Sega Cards were eventually dropped due to their <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory.</b> Master System cartridges were initially branded Mega Cartridges to emphasize their large ROM size compared with cards, but this label fell into disuse after Sega ceased production of new card software. Games manufactured for the system include Psycho Fox, Golvellius, and Phantasy Star, which became a successful franchise for Sega and {{is considered one of}} the benchmark role-playing games. The Master System also hosted games featuring Sega's flagship character at the time, Alex Kidd, including Alex Kidd in Miracle World. [...] has garnered recognition as [...] "a genuine milestone in video game design" [...] due to its innovative blend of platforming gameplay with RPG elements. Built-in titles are common in Master System hardware, including Snail Maze and Hang-On, as well as Alex Kidd in Miracle World and Sonic the Hedgehog. [...] Additional titles were also released in Brazil by Tectoy, including ports of Street Fighter II and Dynamite Headdy after the Master System was discontinued elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|William Luis {{argues that}} How the García Girls Lost Their Accents [...] "is {{an attempt to}} {{understand}} memory, the past and a time before the sisters lost their innocence and accents". Memory {{plays a significant role}} in the text, as a means by which the girls can return to the past of their childhood in the attempt to make sense of their present-day realities. The youngest child, Sofía carries with her only a single memory of her brief childhood on the island, in which the García's Haitian maid, Chucha, says a voodoo goodbye to the girls before they leave for the United States. Sofía feels segregated and deprived [...] "because she has only this one memory to help her reconstruct her bicultural, bilingual self. Though this <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> makes her the least divided of her sisters in many ways... the most disturbed, the most rebellious against her circumstances." [...] Ironically enough, Chucha’s voodoo prediction itself is largely concerned with the concept of memory, as she insists that after leaving the island the girls [...] "will be haunted by what they do and don't remember. But they have spirit in them. They will invent what they need to survive". Julie Barak confirms this notion of memory as both a positive and negative force in the García girls’ constant struggle to unearth their true identities.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Edge staff {{complained that}} {{characters}} other than Nilin were weaker overall. The {{design of the}} Pressens combos {{was thought to be}} flawed, as the rate at which one unlocks them was too slow to use them until the final hours of the game. Though Bramwell found engagement in the first few hours, he said that the later parts of the story suffered from too many science fiction elements. The absence of external motivation for the main character was also disparaged. Reeves was dissatisfied with the characters, whose world he said was more interesting than they were, and the story was berated for being [...] "uninspired". VanOrd observed that the game was held back by an unfulfilling story and sub-par level design. The dialogue and metaphors were criticised for dimming the story's potential. Taljonick also disliked the dialogue, with overwhelming jargon noted as one of its chief offences. The exploration was deemed restrictive, the level design claustrophobic, and the combat system [...] "stiff". Krupa was unimpressed with the action, which he felt lacked variation and was not well executed. His delight in the setting led to disappointment with the limited exploration of it. The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>Memory</b> Remixes received reproval as well. Kietzmann declared Remember Me as [...] "a listless and mediocre action game" [...] whose appearance held more value than its performance, and objected to the combat for being [...] "stilted" [...] and void of excitement. PlayStation Official Magazine – UK staff became quickly disenchanted with the game as it delved into [...] "generic fighting".|$|E

2500|$|The {{amygdala}} is {{a complex}} set of nuclei situated in the anterior temporal lobe and lies beneath the primary olfactory cortex. The amygdala is involved in the formation of memories of emotional experiences, particularly those associated with fear, flight, and defense. It is connected by various pathways {{to other parts of the}} brain, but most notably to the basal forebrain which contains magnocellular cells which provide extensive input into the neocortex and hippocampus. [...] There are also direct projections to the hippocampus from the amygdala, which are involved in the integration of various sensations into memory. [...] Neuropsychological research has suggested that this pathway is vital for the development of olfactory memories. The primary olfactory cortex and the hippocampus have extensive connections with the amygdala through both indirect and direct pathways. [...] It is important for an animal to create memories of olfactory stimuli which threaten its survival. [...] Without a properly functioning amygdala, olfactory memories would not be able to form which could put an animal at risk of dangerous stimuli in its environment due its <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> of such stimuli.|$|E
60|$|There was one {{exception}} to the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> {{of the life of}} his early self, and that was language. By some quirk of atavism, a certain portion of that early self's language had come down to him as a racial memory. In moments of happiness, exaltation, or battle, he was prone to burst out in wild barbaric songs or chants. It was by this means that he located in time and space that strayed half of him who should have been dead and dust for thousands of years. He sang, once, and deliberately, several of the ancient chants in the presence of Professor Wertz, who gave courses in old Saxon and who was a philogist of repute and passion. At the first one, the professor pricked up his ears and demanded to know what mongrel tongue or hog-German it was. When the second chant was rendered, the professor was highly excited. James Ward then concluded the performance by giving a song that always irresistibly rushed to his lips when he was engaged in fierce struggling or fighting. Then it was that Professor Wertz proclaimed it no hog-German, but early German, or early Teuton, of a date that must far precede anything that had ever been discovered and handed down by the scholars. So early was it that it was beyond him; yet it was filled with haunting reminiscences of word-forms he knew and which his trained intuition told him were true and real. He demanded the source of the songs, and asked to borrow the precious book that contained them. Also, he demanded to know why young Ward had always posed as being profoundly ignorant of the German language. And Ward could neither explain his ignorance nor lend the book. Whereupon, after pleadings and entreaties that extended through weeks, Professor Wert took a dislike to the young man, believed him a liar, and classified him as a man of monstrous selfishness for not giving him a glimpse of this wonderful screed that was older than the oldest any philologist had ever known or dreamed.|$|E

50|$|AmigaOS {{is one of}} the few microkernel-based {{operating}} systems not to implement memory protection, though this lack is common amongst many of its contemporary {{operating systems}}. The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> protection is because the 68000 CPU does not include a memory management unit and therefore there is no way to enforce protection of memory. Although this speeds and eases inter-process communication because programs can communicate by simply passing a pointer back and forth, the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> protection made the AmigaOS more vulnerable to crashes from badly behaving programs than other multitasking systems that did implement memory protection, and Amiga OS is fundamentally incapable of enforcing any form of security model since any program had full access to the system. A co-operational memory protection feature was implemented in AmigaOS 4 and could be retrofitted to old AmigaOS systems using Enforcer or CyberGuard tools.|$|E
