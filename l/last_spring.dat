In 2006, the Rays, seeking to expand their fan base across the Tampa Bay area, decided to move their spring training operations to Charlotte Sports Park in Port Charlotte, Florida, about 80 miles south of St. Petersburg.

Al Lang Stadium was reconstructed in 1976, and was renovated again before the Tampa Bay Devil Rays began using it as their first spring training venue in 1998. The Devil Rays / Rays were {{the last of a}} long series of Major League Baseball clubs to conduct spring training and host an affiliated minor league team at Al Lang Stadium. Before the Rays, tenants included the New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, New York Mets, and the Baltimore Orioles, amongst others.

Lilly Icos voluntarily amended the Cialis label to warn of the condition. The FDA was criticized for its handling of the matter, as an FDA safety officer had commented on unusual reports of blindness over 13months before a journal article was published on the issue. United States Senator Chuck Grassley {{wrote a letter to}} the FDA detailing his criticism, saying that the FDA's Office of New Drugs (OND) had taken no action [...] "despite OND's knowledge of the blindness risks since January2004 and general agreement among FDA staff <b>last</b> <b>spring</b> that the label should be updated". Grassley's letter also suggested that Pfizer resisted adding the blindness warning to Viagra's label. In July2005, the FDA said that Viagra, Levitra, and Cialis labels would all carry warnings on the risk of sudden blindness, though it was unclear whether the drugs were actually causing the blindness.|$|E
