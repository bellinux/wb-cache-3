500|$|The 2007–2008 Nazko {{earthquake}} swarm is interpreted to have originated [...] below the surface. The {{character of the}} seismic waves indicated that the swarm originated from a magmatic source. It could have formed {{as a result of}} rock fracturing at the tip of a dike and/or by movement along fault planes due to changes in the <b>local</b> <b>stress</b> field by the expansion and movement of magma. This magmatic activity is potentially linked to the hypothesized Anahim hotspot, a mantle plume that is probably responsible for older volcanism throughout the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This volcanic belt includes the Rainbow, Ilgachuz and Itcha range shield volcanoes west of the Nazko swarm. Individual Anahim volcanoes generally become older {{to the west of the}} Nazko swarm, indicating that the North American Plate is moving in a westerly direction with respect to the hotspot, carrying the volcanoes along with it at a rate of [...] to [...] per year. Because the area where the 2007–2008 Nazko {{earthquake swarm}} originated is at the eastern end of the volcanic belt, it probably represents the youngest portion of the hotspot track. This suggests any future volcanic earthquakes will occur in the Nazko region or further to the east.|$|E

So {{it could be}} seen from the {{equation}} above, m is 3 for solute drag creep. Solute drag creep shows a special phenomenon, which is called the Portevin-Le Chatelier effect. When the applied stress becomes sufficiently large, the dislocations will break away from the solute atoms since dislocation velocity increases with the stress. After breakaway, the stress decreases and the dislocation velocity also decreases, which allows the solute atoms to approach and reach the previously departed dislocations again, leading to a stress increase. The process repeats itself when the next <b>local</b> <b>stress</b> maximum is obtained. So repetitive <b>local</b> <b>stress</b> maxima and minima could be detected during solute drag creep.|$|E
40|$|This thesis reports an {{analytical}} {{investigation into the}} importance of <b>local</b> <b>stresses</b> in influencing the behavior of concrete beams under combined moment and shear. A method of analysis which has recently become available was used to make calculations predicting the behavior of certain beams which were tested earlier by others and reported in the literature. Results of these calculations were compared with test results and also with computations made earlier which neglected the effect of <b>local</b> <b>stresses.</b> In all of the beams considered, the <b>local</b> <b>stresses</b> were created by the application of loads and reactions through bearing {{on the top and}} bottom surfaces of the beams. All of these beams were rectangular beams with longitudinal reinforcement but without web reinforcement. This investigation indicates that <b>local</b> <b>stresses</b> created by bearing tend to stabilize the propagation of tensile cracks as they approach the load points, and to increase predictions of beam ultimate load capacity, but usually the magnitude of the influence is small. One particular beam and crack path were studied for which consideration of <b>local</b> <b>stresses</b> gave rise to a significantly different prediction of failure from that predicted when <b>local</b> <b>stresses</b> were neglected, but in all other cases the predictions of behavior at failure were very similar, both with and without <b>local</b> <b>stresses.</b> As expected from a consideration of Saint-Venant's principle, the quantitative effect of <b>local</b> <b>stresses</b> is negligible at considerable distances from the loads and reactions. In overall effect, the influence of <b>local</b> <b>stresses</b> on beam behavior seems less important than certain other factors, for example, the amount of shearing force transferred across a tensile crack by dowel action of the longitudinal reinforcement...|$|R

40|$|The {{properties}} of aluminium foam sandwich materials (AFS) {{have been studied}} under static and cyclic loads. Two sandwich variants have been compared, namely AlMnl face sheets/AlSi 7 core and AA 6060 face sheets/AlSi 6 Cu 6 core. Under static three- and four-point bending, mainly two failure modes occurred: buckling of the face sheet {{in the region of}} compressive stresses and shear failure of the core between the outer load introduction points. Within the natural scatter of the material properties, these failures could be correlated with the <b>local</b> <b>stresses</b> and the <b>local</b> strength of the materials. The local mechanical properties had been evaluated by compression experiments on the core materials and tensile tests on the sheet materials. Failure charts have been derived which indicate configurations and <b>local</b> <b>stresses</b> associated with failure mechanisms. The local mechanical properties have been introduced in a weakestlink approach that describes the probability of different failure modes {{as a function of the}} <b>local</b> <b>stresses.</b> This approach includes the scatter of the material properties and is able to transfer it to the scatter of the failure modes.
