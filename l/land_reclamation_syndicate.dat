30|$|The <b>Land</b> <b>Reclamation</b> Regulation (LRR), {{effective}} in 1989, was then promulgated by the State Council, which stipulated definitions, {{planning and management}} of <b>land</b> <b>reclamation.</b> In 2006, the Ministry of Land and Resources issued the Notice of Strengthening <b>Land</b> <b>Reclamation</b> Management Work of Production and Construction Projects (NSLR), which incorporated a reclamation plan in the mining license and approval process. In 2011, the State Council issued the <b>Land</b> <b>Reclamation</b> Ordinance (LRO), which revised the 1989 <b>Land</b> <b>Reclamation</b> Regulation. Compared with the 1989 <b>Land</b> <b>Reclamation</b> Regulation, the 2011 <b>Land</b> <b>Reclamation</b> Ordinance further defined the responsibility of mining companies, establishing that reclamation plans {{are part of the}} permitting process and that reclamation monitoring and supervision should occur. Over the past 30  years, China’s reclamation rate of disturbed land has been increased from 1 % in 1987 to 25 % at present (Liu 2011).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{specific}} <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> {{system is}} a technical and economical subsystem of evidence and systematic inventory of all real estate in the <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> in Romania. The evidence and inventory of <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> {{have an important role}} in the implementation of sectoral and local strategies. This paper aims at achieving such an evidence system, appropriate <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> works (control of soil erosion and control of excessive moisture) of perimeter Cojocna of USAMV Cluj-Napoca by building an informational system specific for this field. This system has to be compatible with regulations of the General Cadastre from Romania and with the current methodological rules. Spatial and tabular database will be built using any information obtained from earlier <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> projects for this area, with help of old and new maps and with topographic measurements. This specific informational system of <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> will be using ArcGIS software to represent the obtained spatial and tabular data.

40|$|A large {{quantity}} of land resources {{have been damaged}} due to intense human activities and natural disasters, such as mining operation, infrastructure construction, and landslide. The expectation to restore {{the function of the}} degraded land is increasingly drawing much attention from both publics and governments. After decades 2 ̆ 7 efforts, there is still a heavy task of <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> that needs to be finished in China. Due to the strong regional differentiation, the situation of <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> in each province is different from others. In order to reduce the regional differences with a purpose of promoting the <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> in China, it is essential to explore the spatial-temporal pattern differentiation and influence mechanism of <b>land</b> <b>reclamation.</b> This paper took 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous districts in China as research area to reveal the spatial pattern of the {{quantity of}} <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> and its influence factors. The considered factors included the economic, social, technical, institutional and natural conditions. Data were collected from related statistical yearbook, published paper and China national knowledge internet (CNKI). We employed exploratory spatial data analysis to detect the spatial pattern of <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> in China. Besides, factor analysis was used to discover the public driving force of <b>land</b> <b>reclamation.</b> Panel data model was used to quantify the influence of different factors on the quantity of <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> in different regions. It could be found that: 1) The quantity of <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> in China was featured by a weak spatial autocorrelation and three-grade distribution pattern, and it showed a spatial nonstationary process with inter-annual instability from 1999 to 2013. This pattern was partly in accordance with the economic development and affected by some factors such as the distribution of mineral resource and differentiated <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> policies; 2) Due to the weak spatial aggregation, only one area with H-H (high-high) clustered reclamation was detected in eastern China (the center was Jiangsu Province), and not any other significant hot area was been found; 3) The 3 public factors mainly affecting <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> were mission, drive and support respectively. It can be inferred that the most significant motive force of <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> in China is economic driving force, and the second force is mission of <b>land</b> <b>reclamation.</b> This indicates that, to some degree, the insufficient quantity of <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> cannot only attribute to the technical problem. Obviously, it is a synthesis problem related to other factors, especially the economy. For eastern China, <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> is mainly driven by the pressure of land resource shortage and economic attraction. Central China is also suffering from the pressure of land resource shortage, but its <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> is negatively affected by the ongoing mining activity. In western China, there is more mission of <b>land</b> <b>reclamation,</b> but the natural condition acts as a significant limiting factor. Based on the results above, some policy suggestions, such as improving the mission-driving mechanism, reforming the guidance of policy, enhancing the transfer of technology and coordinating <b>land</b> <b>reclamation</b> project, have been proposed. The results and conclusions above are expected to provide reference for the planning and management of <b>land</b> <b>reclamation...</b>|$|R
