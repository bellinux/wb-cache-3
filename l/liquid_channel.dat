50|$|<b>Liquid</b> <b>Channel</b> (2003) Unveiled at the 115th Audio Engineering Society Convention in November 2003 was the <b>Liquid</b> <b>Channel.</b> This unit {{combines}} analogue {{and digital}} technologies to emulate virtually {{any combination of}} classic mic preamp and compressor. At the front end is an extensive analogue microphone preamplifier, which allows the relationship between mic and preamp to be precisely defined: {{the first step in}} emulation. Then a DSP-based sampling/emulation system, licensed from Sintefex Audio, comes into play, which uses ‘Dynamic Convolution’ techniques based on actual measurements of classic compressors, to re-synthesise their behaviour. In addition there is a control to vary the amount of second harmonic distortion. The front panel is entirely digital, and as a result all the unit’s settings can be saved in the unit’s 99 memories. Additional emulations can be added to the 40 on-board sets, and existing sets archived, via USB. The output side includes a 192 kHz A/D.|$|E

40|$|During alloy solidification, {{interdendritic}} microsegregation causes density {{differences between}} entrapped liquid and bulk liquid {{which provides a}} driving force for convection.

In ingot castings where the heat flow is vertically downwards and the solute less dense than the solute the convective flow is antiparallel with the flow caused by contraction on freezing.

The biporous evaporation device utilizes thermally-connected, mechanically-supported, high capillarity membranes that maximize thin film evaporation and high permeability <b>liquid</b> supply <b>channels</b> that allow for lower viscous pressure losses. The 600 nm thick membrane was fabricated on a silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer, fusion-bonded to a separate wafer with larger <b>liquid</b> <b>channels.</b> Spreading effects and overall device performance arising from non-uniform heating and evaporation of methanol was captured experimentally. Heat fluxes up to 412 W/cm 2, over an area of O. 4 x 5 mm, and with a temperature rise of 24. 1 K from the heated substrate to ambient vapor, were obtained. These results are in good agreement with a high-fidelity, coupled fluid convection and solid conduction compact model, which was necessitated by computational feasibility, which incorporates non-equilibrium and sub-continuum effects at the liquid-vapor interface. This work provides a proof-of-concept demonstration of our biporous evaporation device.
