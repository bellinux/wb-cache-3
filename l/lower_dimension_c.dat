Our methods {{are based on}} certain replicative properties of the O(n) -module structure on a "curvature space" and a realization of a "curvature space" {{by the action of}} the symmetric tensor of the Lie algebra so(n) on symmetric matrices. By our methods, we are able to find a complete generator set of functional invariants over the curvature tensor fields of a manifold with <b>lower</b> <b>dimensions.</b> (<b>C)</b> 1998 Academic Press...|$|R

40|$|By {{carefully}} {{analyzing the}} geodesic motion {{of a test}} particle in the bulk of brane worlds, we identify an extra force which is recognized in a spacetime of one <b>lower</b> <b>dimension</b> as a nongravitational force acting on the particle. Such extra force acts on the particle {{in such a way}} that the conventional particle mechanics in one <b>lower</b> <b>dimension</b> is violated, thereby hinting at the higher-dimensional origin of embedded spacetime in the brane world scenario. We obtain the explicit equations describing the motion of the bulk test particle as observed in one <b>lower</b> <b>dimension</b> for general gravitating configurations in brane worlds and identify the extra nongravitational force acting on the particle measured in one <b>lower</b> <b>dimension.</b> (24 refs) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} if $X$ is a uniformly perfect {{complete}} metric space satisfying the finite doubling property, then there exists a fully supported measure with <b>lower</b> regularity <b>dimension</b> {{as close to the}} <b>lower</b> <b>dimension</b> of $X$ as we wish. Furthermore, we show that, under the condensation open set condition, the <b>lower</b> <b>dimension</b> of an inhomogeneous self-similar set $E_C$ coincides with the <b>lower</b> <b>dimension</b> of the condensation set $C$, while the Assouad dimension of $E_C$ is the maximum of the Assouad dimensions of the corresponding self-similar set $E$ and the condensation set $C$. If the Assouad dimension of $C$ is strictly smaller than the Assouad dimension of $E$, then the upper regularity dimension of any measure supported on $E_C$ is strictly larger than the Assouad dimension of $E_C$. Surprisingly, the corresponding statement for the <b>lower</b> regularity <b>dimension</b> fails...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} several (related) {{notions of}} geometric regularity {{in the context}} of limit sets of geometrically finite Kleinian groups and associated Patterson-Sullivan measures. We begin by computing the upper and <b>lower</b> regularity <b>dimensions</b> of the Patterson-Sullivan measure, which involves controlling the relative measure of concentric balls. We then compute the Assouad and <b>lower</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the limit set, which involves controlling local doubling properties. Unlike the Hausdorff, packing, and box-counting dimensions, we show that the Assouad and <b>lower</b> <b>dimensions</b> are not necessarily given by the Poincaré exponent.
