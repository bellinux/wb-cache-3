5000|$|Candi Kubeck {{began as}} an {{instructor}} pilot at small airfields and working at various commuter and freight airlines based in California and Arizona [...] From there, she became an Air Traffic Controller at El Paso International Airport. But these were just the first steps to what {{she really wanted to}} be. She wanted to fly for commercial airlines. Kubeck applied for the major airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines, but as a <b>low-time</b> <b>pilot</b> (pilot experience is measured in logged flight hours) she was not accepted at the time. In 1989, she was hired by Eastern Airlines as a strikebreaker, crossing the picket line during a strike by the company's unionized pilots. It was a move that she believed was necessary to break in, but it also made her a target of harassment by strikers. Upon completion of training, Kubeck was assigned as a first officer on Eastern's biggest plane, the Airbus A300, subsequently leaving Eastern after its abrupt shutdown in January 1991. When low-cost startup Valujet Airlines began operations in 1993 she was hired almost immediately. Kubeck became a captain for ValuJet and flew DC-9s.|$|E

The RV-9 has a slow stall speed, {{comparable to the}} Cessna 150, and docile handling suitable for <b>low-time</b> <b>pilots.</b> The cruise speed is a very respectable 167 mi/h km/h TAS even with the [...] engine.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} decision-making in high and <b>low-time</b> <b>pilots</b> (n= 26) on a simulated IFR cross-country flight using MIDIS 3. 0, a microcomputer-based flight-decision simulator. When confronted with situations which could endanger the safety and/or {{efficiency of the}} flight, {{it was hypothesized that}} high-time pilots would recognize the cues relevant to the problem, "pattern match " these cues with a situational schemata, or script, from long `-arm memory (LTM), and choose to execute their first workable solution. it was hyrpothesized that <b>low-time</b> <b>pilots</b> would also attempt the same decision-making strategy, but because of their smaller experiential repertoires would fail to make a "pattern match " in LTM. It was posited that novices then are forced to use a "utility " stratey in which they must integrate cues with declarative knowledge, generate alternatives, evaluate outcomes, and finally choose the alternative calculated to brinq the most utility. The difference in strategies was hypothesized to lead high-time pilots to choose more optimal solutions. The results clearly show that high-time pilots decision optimality is significantly better than <b>low-time</b> <b>pilots.</b> â€¢High-time pilots detected significantly more cues relevant to the problem, and chose the first alternativo they considered significantly more often than their colleagues. The two groups were no different in basic information processing abilities, but were very different (with high-time pilots scoring significantly better) on tests measuring LTM based knowledge representations. Stepwise multiple regression analyses selected the pilot's certification level, not total flight time, as the best predictor of performance accounting for over half the variance. The LTM test measures were generally the next best predictors of performance. ii...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} Flight Technical Error (FTE) from recent SATS experiments, called the Higher Volume Operations (HVO) Simulation and Flight experiments, which NASA conducted to determine pilot acceptability of the HVO concept for normal operating conditions. Reported are FTE results from simulation and flight experiment data indicating the SATS HVO concept is viable and acceptable to <b>low-time</b> instrument rated <b>pilots</b> when compared with today s system (baseline). Described is the comparative FTE analysis of lateral, vertical, and airspeed deviations from the baseline and SATS HVO experimental flight procedures. Based on FTE analysis, all evaluation subjects, <b>low-time</b> instrument-rated <b>pilots,</b> flew the HVO procedures safely and proficiently in comparison to today s system. In all cases, {{the results of the}} flight experiment validated the results of the simulation experiment and confirm the utility of the simulation platform for comparative Human in the Loop (HITL) studies of SATS HVO and Baseline operations...|$|R
40|$|Expanding {{services}} {{to some of}} the 4900 airports not currently served by scheduled air carriers can potentially ease traffic congestion and reduce flight delays at major airports. By developing new avionics and procedures for approach and landing during instrument meteorological conditions, the NASA small aircraft transportation system program demonstrated higher traffic volume general aviation operations at noncontrolled airports, without assistance from air traffic control. This paper proposes revised minimum separations and automated sequencing to help general aviation pilots maintain self-separation andmake proper approach timing decisions in a self-controlled airport environment. Total holding time is the measure of merit, and evaluation was conducted with multiple pilots flying simultaneously in a real-time distributed simulation environment. A rudimentary human factors analysis was also conducted to determine the benefits of shifting some spacing functions from the pilot to the onboard systems, for the purpose of reduction in pilot workload. The effect of increased automation on pilot tracking performance was also measured. Results presented in the paper show that the proposed modifications can provide significant reductions in total holding time, thereby avoiding potential bottlenecks and improving efficiency. Reduction in pilot workload was observed, and <b>low-time</b> <b>pilots</b> exhibited improved tracking performance.

40|$|Study of <b>low-time</b> general {{aviation}} <b>pilots,</b> who, {{in a series}} of spot landings, were suddenly deprived of binocular vision by patching either eye on the downwind leg of a standard, closed traffic pattern. Data collected during these landings were compared with control data from landings flown with normal vision during the same flight. The sequence of patching and the mix of control and monocular landings were randomized to minimize the effect of learning. No decrease in performance was observed during landings with vision restricted to one eye, in fact, performance improved. This observation is reported at a high level of confidence (p less than 0. 001). These findings confirm the previous work of Lewis and Krier and have important implications with regard to aeromedical certification standards...|$|R
40|$|A {{flight test}} was {{performed}} to compare the use of three advanced primary flight and navigation display concepts to a baseline, round-dial concept to assess the potential for advanced operations. The displays were evaluated during visual and instrument approach procedures including an advanced instrument approach resembling a visual airport traffic pattern. Nineteen pilots from three pilot groups, reflecting the diverse piloting skills of the General Aviation pilot population, served as evaluation subjects. The experiment had two thrusts: 1) {{an examination of the}} capabilities of low-time (i. e., < 400 hours), non-instrument-rated pilots to perform nominal instrument approaches, and 2) an exploration of potential advanced Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) -like approaches in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). Within this context, advanced display concepts are considered to include integrated navigation and primary flight displays with either aircraft attitude flight directors or Highway In The Sky (HITS) guidance with and without a synthetic depiction of the external visuals (i. e., synthetic vision). Relative to the first thrust, the results indicate that using an advanced display concept, as tested herein, <b>low-time,</b> non-instrument-rated <b>pilots</b> can exhibit flight-technical performance, subjective workload and situation awareness ratings as good as or better than high-time Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) -rated pilots using Baseline Round Dials for a nominal IMC approach. For the second thrust, the results indicate advanced VMC-like approaches are feasible in IMC, for all pilot groups tested for only the Synthetic Vision System (SVS) advanced display concept...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a summary of}} conclusions from the Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) Higher Volume Operations (HVO) Flight Experiment which NASA conducted to determine pilot acceptability of the HVO concept for normal conditions. The SATS HVO concept improves efficiency at non-towered, non-radar airports in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) while achieving a level of safety equal to today s system. Reported are results from flight experiment data that indicate that the SATS HVO concept is viable. The success of the SATS HVO concept is based on acceptable pilot workload, performance, and subjective criteria {{when compared to the}} procedural control operations in use today at non-towered, non-radar controlled airfields in IMC. The HVO Flight Experiment, flown on NASA's Cirrus SR 22, used a subset of the HVO Simulation Experiment scenarios and evaluation pilots in order to validate the simulation experiment results. HVO and Baseline (today s system) scenarios flown included: single aircraft arriving for a GPS non-precision approach; aircraft arriving for the approach with multiple traffic aircraft; and aircraft arriving for the approach with multiple traffic aircraft and then conducting a missed approach. Results reveal that all twelve <b>low-time</b> instrument-rated <b>pilots</b> preferred SATS HVO when compared to current procedural separation operations. These pilots also flew the HVO procedures safely and proficiently without additional workload in comparison to today s system (Baseline). Detailed results of pilot flight technical error, and their subjective assessments of workload and situation awareness are presented in this paper...|$|R
