30|$|The LOMGRAV survey, {{like most}} {{airborne}} surveys, includes {{a large number}} of parallel, densely spaced traverse lines and a number of tie-lines with larger line spacing flown orthogonal to the traverse lines. During <b>line</b> <b>levelling,</b> differences in data values at intersections of traverse lines with tie-lines (cross-over differences) are taken into account to reduce errors arising from data offsets between adjacent survey lines (e.g. heading errors) or imperfect temporal reduction which could otherwise lead to severe artefacts during gridding (Pilkington and Thurston, 2001).|$|E
30|$|The {{positions}} {{corresponding to}} each of the 10 Hz magnetic scalar data points were linearly interpolated from the 1 Hz aircraft positions. For the preliminary processing described here we have not explicitly accounted for the aircraft magnetic field. Since its influence on the scalar measurements mainly depends on the orientation of the aircraft with respect to the magnetic field vector (heading error) and the large aircraft followed individual lines very smoothly, we rely on its removal by the applied <b>line</b> <b>levelling</b> technique.|$|E
30|$|Marine {{magnetic}} data {{acquired by}} a variety of oceanographic institutions and ships worldwide are gathered by the World Data Service (WDS) for Geophysics operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Boulder, CO, USA (see [URL] These data have been carefully reprocessed by Quesnel et al. (2009), who performed extensive data cleaning, removal of the core and external fields using the comprehensive model CM 4 (Sabaka et al. 2004), and <b>line</b> <b>levelling.</b> The data set produced by these authors (Quesnel et al. 2009) has been the base of the WDMAM version 1 (Korhonen et al. 2007) over the oceans. We use the same data set, complemented by additional marine data made available by NOAA between 2006 and 2010 and processed in the same way (Takemi Ishihara and Manuel Catalan, personal communication, 2011), as the base of the WDMAM version 2 over the oceans. To produce the grid, these data sets have been interpolated using the GMT function nearneighbor with either a 40 -km search radius requiring data in each on the four quadrants, or a 5 -km search radius requiring data only in one quadrant. This approach leads to a homogeneous grid for area with a high density of data and the preservation of the tracks when these are isolated.|$|E

30|$|In the LOMGRAV survey, however, also intersections of {{traverse}} lines exist, both in {{the main}} survey area and in the radial flight lines from and to the three airfields (Fig. 1 (a, b)). Additionally, some flights included sections {{from more than one}} traverse line or parts of traverse lines were flown more than once. Occasionally, intersecting or overlapping lines were flown at different altitudes. Furthermore, each of the three prominent tie-lines (North, Centre, South) are broken up into partly overlapping sections. To account for these features, some of the lines with deviating altitude were removed and an adaptive <b>line</b> <b>levelling</b> procedure was performed on the reduced survey data ΔFsurvey. In this procedure, we distinguish between tie-line cross-over differences and traverse-line cross-over differences. Firstly, the flight lines were split into separate traverse lines and tie-lines. Spacing is about 12 to 15 km for the traverse lines in the main survey area, 316 km between the North tie-line and the Centre tie-line and 240 km between the Centre and the South tie-line (Fig. 1 (b)). The North, Centre and South tie-line consists of two, three and four partly overlapping sections, respectively. Secondly, the sections of each tie-line were merged by shifting ΔFsurvey by a constant offset for each section such that the shifted data mean values are identical in the overlapping parts. The offsets are between − 3.9 nT and − 21.1 nT and the mean values are based on about 150 to 1200 measurements, which show a similar variation in the overlapping region. Thirdly, for each merged tie-line, the tie-line cross-over differences were calculated and the tie-line was adjusted by the straight line fit to the cross-over differences. The tie-line cross-over differences after adjustment and the traverse-line cross-over differences are shown in Fig. 1 (b). The fourth step is based on the adjusted tie-line cross-over differences. Traverse lines that intersect only two tie-lines were DC-shifted by the mean value of the two tie-line cross-over differences. Traverse lines that intersect three tie-lines were adjusted by a cubic spline function through the three tie-line cross-over differences plus two artificial end points equal to the most adjacent cross-over data, that were added to stabilise the fit. A fifth step is taking into account traverse line crossover differences from traverse line intersections or repeatedly flown traverse lines, that otherwise pose a problem for gridding, but also give an opportunity to make additional adjustments in the <b>line</b> <b>levelling.</b> This is especially an advantage for the traverse lines that only cross two tie-lines (adjusted by a DC shift in step four). One traverse line after the other was adjusted by a cubic spline similar as in step four, but this time the cubic spline was fitted to both tie-line cross-over differences as well traverse line cross-over differences.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{incorrect}} {{restoration of}} the joint line during TKA can result in joint instability, anterior knee pain, limited range of motion, and joint stiffness. The joint <b>line</b> <b>level</b> is usually measured only on pre- and post-operative radiographs. Current knee navigation systems can now potentially support intra-operatively joint line restoration by controlling the exact amount of the bone-cartilage removed and the corresponding overall thickness of the components implanted. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess how well the joint <b>line</b> <b>level</b> is restored and the tibiofemoral overstuffing prevented when standard knee surgical navigation is used carefully also with these purposes. Intra-operative measurements during navigated TKA were taken. METHODS: Sixty-seven primary TKAs were followed prospectively. The variation before and after prosthesis component implantation of the joint <b>line</b> <b>level,</b> both in the femoral and tibial reference, was measured intra-operatively by an instrumented probe. Overstuffing was measured as the difference between the overall craniocaudal thickness of the femoral and tibial prosthesis components inserted and the thickness of the bone-cartilage removed. RESULTS: A significant elevation in the joint <b>line</b> <b>level</b> after prosthesis implantation was found with respect to the tibial reference (1. 9  ±  2. 4  mm, mean ± SD), very little to the femoral reference (0. 3  ±  2. 1  mm), perhaps accounted for the femur-first operative technique utilized. Overstuffing was on the average of 2. 2  ±  3. 0  mm. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a knee navigation system can also support well a proper {{restoration of the}} joint <b>line</b> <b>level</b> and limit the risk of overstuffing when relevant measurements are taken carefully during operation.
