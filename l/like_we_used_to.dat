Speaking {{of the change in}} their appearance, Kaoru said [...] "Eventually, we felt that dressing <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> onstage put up a wall between us and the audience, so we stopped wearing the kind of makeup we did before." [...] However, he said they still occasionally wear makeup, just not as much. Toshiya explained [...] "To be honest, when we first started and we were wearing a lot of makeup on stage and stuff, {{there were a lot of}} bands doing that at the time in Japan, and people thought it was cool. But not anymore, ha ha." [...] Die said [...] "They saw us as idols but we aren't idols. We are a band, we play music and want to be known for it. So we decided to change our style slowly." [...] Kyo stated that for Dir en Grey it was always about the music and when wearing lots of makeup became popular, [...] "we didn't want to be associated with a lot of the poor quality bands in that scene." ...|$|E

Without it no cattleman, nor half a hundred cowboys, if he had so many, could ever recognize all the cattle in a big herd. There are no fences on our ranges. They are all open to everybody. Some day I hope we'll be rich enough to fence a range. The different herds graze together. Every calf has to be caught, if possible, and branded with the mark of its mother. That's no easy job. A maverick is an unbranded calf that has been weaned and shifts for itself. The maverick then belongs to the man who finds it and brands it. These little calves that lose their mothers sure have a cruel time of it. Many of them die. Then the coyotes and wolves and lions prey on them. Every year we have two big round-ups, but the boys do some branding all the year. A calf should be branded as soon as it's found. This is a safeguard against cattle-thieves. We don't have the rustling of herds and bunches of cattle <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to.</b> But there's always the calf-thief, and always will be as long as there's cattle-raising. The thieves have a good many cunning tricks. They kill the calf's mother or slit the calf's tongue so it can't suck and so loses its mother. They steal and hide a calf and watch it till it's big enough to fare for itself, and then brand it. They make imperfect brands and finish them at a later time.|$|E

Even when I am feeling worst--when my chest aches, you know--I grow quite happy when I think of what the papers wrote about you: the Times and the Saturday Review, and the Spectator, {{and the rest of}} them.
