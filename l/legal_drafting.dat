25|$|Legal {{writing is}} of two, broad categories: (i) legal {{analysis}} and (ii) <b>legal</b> <b>drafting.</b> Legal analysis is two-fold: (1) predictive analysis, and (2) persuasive analysis. In the United States, in most law schools students must learn legal writing; the courses focus on: (1) predictive analysis, i.e., an outcome-predicting memorandum (positive or negative) {{of a given}} action for the attorney's client; and (2) persuasive analysis, e.g., motions and briefs. Although not as widely taught in law schools, <b>legal</b> <b>drafting</b> courses exist; other types of legal writing concentrate upon writing appeals or on interdisciplinary aspects of persuasion.|$|E

25|$|As {{a student}} at the University of Texas School of Law in 1981, Garner began noticing odd usages in lawbooks—many of them dating back to Shakespeare. These became the source {{material}} for his first book, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage. That book was published by Oxford University Press in 1987 and is now in its third edition (published in 2011 and retitled Garner's Dictionary of Legal Usage). Since 1990, his main work has been teaching seminars such as Advanced Legal Writing and Editing, Advanced <b>Legal</b> <b>Drafting,</b> and The Winning Brief. Garner has also created many online seminars on writing and advocacy. Since 2006, Garner has interspersed in his lectures numerous video clips from the dozens of judges he has interviewed on the art of writing and on advocacy. In 2006–2007, he interviewed eight of the nine Justices of the United States Supreme Court. Since then, he has interviewed a ninth: Justice Elena Kagan. All his Supreme Court interviews are available online. When these interviews first appeared in print, they were featured {{on the front page of}} the New York Times. In addition, Garner has interviewed circuit judges on all the federal circuits. He has compiled an extensive archive of what American judges in the early 21st century say about effective writing and advocacy.|$|E
