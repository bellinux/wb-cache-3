5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Bucharest, Cerna completed his studies in the German Empire. There, he attended the University of Berlin and the University of <b>Leipzig,</b> befriending the self-exiled Romanian dramatist Ion Luca Caragiale and the literary critic Paul Zarifopol. Cerna died in <b>Leipzig</b> {{at the age of}} thirty-one, after a long battle with tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>Leipzig</b> {{performances}} of the cantata, the first verse of the chorale was probably sung by a soprano, instead of using an instrumental rendition of the chorale tune in the first aria. The cantata was transposed from C major to E-flat major at <b>Leipzig,</b> where the recorders may {{have been replaced by}} transverse flutes.|$|E

Fürst was 8 years Delitsch's senior.|$|R

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, <b>Leipzig</b> {{was assigned to the}} blocking force that was intended to prevent the escape of the Polish Navy from the Baltic; they were unsuccessful. <b>Leipzig</b> thereafter went to the North Sea, where she and the other light cruisers laid a series of defensive minefields. This task lasted {{through the end of the}} month, after which she returned to the Baltic for training maneuvers. On 1719 November, <b>Leipzig</b> covered a minelaying operation in the North Sea. She joined Deutschland, Köln, and three torpedo boats for a sweep in the Skagerrak for Allied shipping on 2122 November. <b>Leipzig</b> was tasked with escorting the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau through the Skagerrak, and with covering their return on the 27th.|$|E
5|$|Bach led a {{performance}} in the court chapel of Schloss Weimar on 17 June 1714, known as the Weimar version. He revised the work for performances, possibly in Hamburg and several revivals in <b>Leipzig,</b> adding for the first <b>Leipzig</b> version four trombones playing colla parte.|$|E

5|$|Glasgow pursued <b>Leipzig,</b> {{and quickly}} caught up, opening fire by 14:40. After {{about twenty minutes}} of firing, <b>Leipzig</b> was hit; she turned to port to open the range, before turning to {{starboard}} {{in order to bring}} her full broadside into action. In the ensuing action, both ships were hit several times, forcing Glasgow to break off and fall behind the more powerful armored cruisers. <b>Leipzig</b> was battered severely by Cornwall and Kent and set on fire; she nevertheless remained in action and continued to fight. In the course of the engagement, <b>Leipzig</b> hit Cornwall eighteen times, causing a significant list to port. She fired three torpedoes at the British ships, but failed to score any hits with them. At 19:20, Haun issued the order to scuttle his wrecked ship; the British approached and opened fire on the stricken cruiser at close range, killing large numbers of the crew. The British also destroyed a cutter filled with survivors, killing all of them. <b>Leipzig</b> finally capsized and sank at 21:05, with Haun going down with his ship. Only eighteen men were pulled from the freezing water.|$|E

5|$|In a heavy fog in October 1944, <b>Leipzig</b> {{collided}} with the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen; the damage was so severe that the navy decided complete repairs were unfeasible. Instead, they repaired <b>Leipzig</b> enough to keep her afloat, and in that state, provided gunfire support to the defenders of Gotenhafen against the advancing Red Army in March 1945. As the Germans continued to retreat in the east, <b>Leipzig</b> was then used to transport a group of fleeing German civilians. She reached Denmark by late April. After {{the end of the}} war, <b>Leipzig</b> was used as a barracks ship for minesweeping forces and was scuttled in July 1946.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Leipzig</b> {{class was}} {{a class of}} two light cruisers of the German Reichsmarine and later Kriegsmarine; the class {{comprised}} <b>Leipzig,</b> the lead ship, and Nürnberg, which was built to a slightly modified design. The ships were improvements over the preceding Königsberg-class cruisers, being slightly larger, with a more efficient arrangement of the main battery and improved armor protection. <b>Leipzig</b> was built between 1928 and 1931, and Nürnberg followed between 1934 and 1935.|$|E
5|$|A repeat {{performance}} of BWV243a may have accompanied the first performance of BWV10 on 2July 1724. The libretto of the cantata performed in <b>Leipzig</b> at {{the feast of}} the Visitation of 1725 survives. Maria Aurora von Königsmarck is the possible author of this Magnificat paraphrase. Around a decade before the libretto was reprinted in <b>Leipzig</b> it had already been set by Reinhard Keiser and Johann Mattheson. It is not known whether Bach set the libretto, neither which setting of the libretto was used for the 1725 Visitation feast in <b>Leipzig.</b> A year later Bach performed Der Herr wird ein Neues im Lande, JLB13, a Visitation cantata by his second cousin Johann Ludwig Bach. Picander's libretto for the Visitation cantata of 1728 may have been set as part of Bach's fourth cantata cycle: the libretto, surviving without music, starts with a dictum quoted from Luther's German translation of Luke1:46–47.|$|E
5|$|After safely {{returning}} to port in Kiel, <b>Leipzig</b> {{was taken into}} the Deutsche Werke shipyard for repairs. She was decommissioned while under repair and reclassified as a training ship. To accommodate additional training crews, four of the ship's boilers were removed. She returned to service in late 1940. In early June 1941, she escorted the heavy cruiser Lützow (formerly Deutschland) to Norway. After {{she returned to the}} Baltic, she and the cruiser Emden provided artillery support to advancing German ground forces during Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. In September, she supported the invasion of the Baltic islands in the West Estonian archipelago. While bombarding Soviet positions on Moon Island, <b>Leipzig</b> was attacked unsuccessfully by the Soviet submarine Shch-317. In late September, the ship joined the German Baltic Fleet, centered on the battleship Tirpitz; the fleet was tasked with blocking a possible Soviet attempt {{to break out of the}} Baltic. <b>Leipzig</b> returned to Kiel in October, and conducted maneuvers with the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer. <b>Leipzig</b> became the flagship of the training fleet in 1942; she spent the year performing training duties.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of war, both ships were fitted with a degaussing coil to protect them against magnetic mines. <b>Leipzig</b> had her aircraft equipment removed in 1941, along with her after torpedo tubes. In 1942, Nürnbergs aircraft handling equipment and aft torpedo tubes were also removed. Throughout the war, the ships' radar suites were upgraded; in March 1941, Nürnberg was equipped with FuMO 21 radar and in early 1942, a FuMO 25 radar set was installed. The latter was a search radar for surface targets and low-flying aircraft at low range. The FuMO 21 set {{was replaced by the}} short-range FuMO 63 Hohentwiel 50-centimeter radar. Nürnberg was also fitted with four Metox radar warning receivers. <b>Leipzig</b> did not receive her FuMO 24/25 radar set until 1943; this was to be the last modification for <b>Leipzig.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Mendelssohn {{attributed}} {{great importance}} to musical education, and made a substantial commitment to the Conservatoire he founded in <b>Leipzig,</b> he did not greatly enjoy teaching and took only a very few private pupils who he believed had notable qualities. Amongst such students were the composer William Sterndale Bennett, the pianist Camille-Marie Stamaty, the violinist and composer Julius Eichberg, and Walther von Goethe (grandson of the poet). At the <b>Leipzig</b> Conservatoire Mendelssohn taught classes in composition and ensemble playing.|$|E
