500|$|I {{always loved}} going to Ogmore and Southerndown. I thought the cliffs there {{looked like a}} {{building}} anyway. A building capable of withstanding the roughest weather for hundreds of years. The older they get, the better they look. I wondered {{if it would be}} possible to make a building which had the same qualities as these magnificent cliffs. To do that I needed a lot of stone. Normal stone for buildings has to be specially cut into blocks; it takes a long time to make and costs a fortune. But in north Wales the historic slate industry has left behind whole mountains of waste stone that no-one wants. This was stone cut from the mountainside for nearly two hundred years but which wasn't good enough to make roof slates. Over 90% was thrown away. But it was ideal for making walls <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> had in mind... —architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|E
500|$|The animators and {{character}} designers {{had a lot}} of discussion about what Frank Grimes should look like. He was originally designed as a [...] "burly ex-marine guy with a crew cut", but would later be modeled after Michael Douglas in the movie Falling Down and director Jim Reardon's college roommate. Hank Azaria provided the voice of Frank Grimes, even though such a role would normally have been performed by a guest star. The producers decided Azaria was more suitable because the role involved a great deal of frustration and required extensive knowledge of the show. Azaria felt that the role should instead go to William H. Macy. According to Azaria, [...] "I based the character on William Macy. I can't really copy him vocally, but I tried to get as close as I could and copy his rhythms and the way he has that sort of seething passion underneath that total calm exterior." [...] The producers worked a lot with Azaria to help him perfect the role, and gave him more guidance than they normally would. Azaria felt that it was the role he worked hardest on, adding [...] "I think it's the one we did the most takes on, the most emotional, it felt <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> worked on the hardest from a performance point of view, in preparation and in execution." ...|$|E

5000|$|The song {{initially}} performed poorly and was {{overshadowed by}} Holiday Inn&apos;s first hit song: [...] "Be Careful, It's My Heart". By {{the end of}} October 1942, [...] "White Christmas" [...] topped the Your Hit Parade chart. It remained in that position {{until well into the}} new year. It has often been noted that the mix of melancholy—"just <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>I</b> used to know"—with comforting images of home—"where the treetops glisten"—resonated especially strongly with listeners during World War II. A few weeks after the attacks on Pearl Harbor, Crosby introduced “White Christmas” on a Christmas Day broadcast. [...] The Armed Forces Network was flooded with requests for the song. The recording is noted for Crosby's whistling during the second chorus.|$|R

[...] Reflecting on the reaction to the protest, he said [...] "Although the blogs it generated were mixed, the emails and letters I received about the prayer and protest were all inspiring, most of these apologetic the interruption and thankful. Although we have much more conscious awareness of religious pluralism today than in the past, the religious as well as non-religious people need to have deeper, broader and more inclusive understanding of religion, which still wields huge power." [...] Thinking of those who opposed the prayer he said [...] "Despite our philosophical differences, we have similar objectives. We all believe in a superior being and we simply differ on how each of us perceives/embodies/responds to Ultimate/Divine Reality. Differences begin when we start claiming to be the sole guardians of 'truth.' We should share our quest for truth. Dialogue will make us spiritually richer. We need to overcome the prejudices handed down to us by the previous generations." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have now}} been long enough in France to {{understand}} that seeing an article in an exhibition <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> am describing, is no proof that it enters at all into the comforts and civilization of the nation, {{although it may be}} an object as homely as a harrow or a spade. The scientific part of the country has little influence, in this way, on the operative. The chasm between knowledge and ignorance is so vast in France, that it requires a long time for the simplest idea to find its way across it.|$|E

40|$|Error-free {{computation}} is an unattainable ideal, yet {{our world}} now contains many computers that appear error-free to their users. That such things are possible {{is explained by}} sophisticated theorems that demonstrate the possibility of efficiently reducing computational errors introduced by reasonably well-behaved noise.   My thesis is {{about the problem of}} determining whether noise in prototype quantum information processors is sufficiently well-behaved for fault-tolerant quantum computing to be possible. My work is divided into two themes. The first theme is the interpretation of average gate fidelity, a quantity that has become the standard performance metric for assessing progress towards fault tolerance. I have elucidated the connection between average gate fidelity and the requirements of fault-tolerant quantum computing by demonstrating the limits of fidelity as a proxy for error rate, the usual metric in fault-tolerance literature. I thereby conclude that information additional to fidelity is required to assess progress towards fault-tolerance. The second theme is the characterization of two-level defect systems, a particularly deleterious kind of noise that can affect superconducting-integrated-circuit-based quantum computing prototypes. I have designed statistical experimental design algorithms that can rigorously assess the influence of these defect systems, and I helped develop a proposal to mitigate their influence. I thereby demonstrate that existing experimental techniques can become much more powerful by employing advanced data collection procedures.   My work has immediate implications for current research efforts towards the first working quantum computer. Theoretical work should be directed at assessing noise sources using metrics other than average gate fidelity, and future experimental characterization techniques should become more modular in order to incorporate advanced statistical inference techniques <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>I</b> develop herein...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. IEEE is {{currently}} conducting {{an effort to}} standardize a full duplex, spatial reuse, ring network architecture, called the Resilient Packet Ring (IEEE P 802. 17). We discuss the relationship between spatial reuse and head of line blocking in such a ring. An algorithm that schedules packets individually based on destination address is outlined. We have written {{a model of the}} RPR architecture in the programming language Java, and simulated several scenarios in order to evaluate and compare our algorithm with a conventional ring fairness algorithm. Our performance evaluations show {{that it is possible to}} achieve significant higher throughput for traffic scenarios where head of line blocking traditionally has degraded performance.

40|$|You are on {{the staff}} of a Christian Counseling Center {{and in the course of}} a week you {{encounter}} the following clients: 1. A minister who became sexually involved with a teen-age girl at a previous church several years ago. His current church is not aware of this. He says he has “dealt with his problem. ” 2. A Christian woman whose husband is physically abusive and who has threatened worse to her and their young child if she tells anyone or leaves him. She comes to your office with cuts and bruises, afraid to go home and afraid not to go home. She doesn’t know what she should do or can do. 3. A single mother who is severely depressed and who is not taking adequate care of her two young children, both under the age of four. She denies that her personal problems are affecting her abil-ity to take care of her children. The list could easily go on. Helping professionals, Christian or other-wise, are daily confronted with issues that are immensely complex and which call forth judgments and actions that confound any attempts to neatly sepa-rate “clinical knowledge and skill, ” our preferred professional roles and boundaries, and, fundamentally, our world-view, faith, moral judgment, and character. Much as we would like to keep it simple, real life is messy and all of a piece. All kinds of things interconnect and interact. How would you respond to clients <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>I</b> just mentioned? Christian social workers need to know who they are and what resources they have to do the right thing as children of God—personally, socially, and professionally.
