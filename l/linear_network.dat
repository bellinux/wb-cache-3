25|$|Capacitors {{deviate from}} the ideal {{capacitor}} equation {{in a number}} of ways. Some of these, such as leakage current and parasitic effects are linear, or can be analyzed as nearly linear, and can be dealt with by adding virtual components to the equivalent circuit of an ideal capacitor. The usual methods of network analysis can then be applied. In other cases, such as with breakdown voltage, the effect is non-linear and ordinary (normal, e.g., <b>linear)</b> <b>network</b> analysis cannot be used, the effect must be dealt with separately. There is yet another group, which may be linear but invalidate the assumption in the analysis that capacitance is a constant. Such an example is temperature dependence. Finally, combined parasitic effects such as inherent inductance, resistance, or dielectric losses can exhibit non-uniform behavior at variable frequencies of operation.|$|E

If one is balancing costs against information diffusion, scale-free should always be preferred to <b>linear</b> <b>networks,</b> as the associated costs do not diverge much (in general, scale-free networks are more resilient than linear ones).|$|R

500|$|Y and Δ are {{important}} topologies in <b>linear</b> <b>network</b> analysis due to these being the simplest possible three-terminal networks. A Y-Δ transform {{is available for}} linear circuits. [...] This transform is important {{because there are some}} networks that cannot be analysed in terms of series and parallel combinations. An example of this is the network of figure 1.6, consisting of a Y network connected in parallel with a Δ network. [...] Say it is desired to calculate the impedance between two nodes of the network. [...] In many networks this can be done by successive applications of the rules for combination of series or parallel impedances. [...] This is not, however, possible in this case where the Y-Δ transform is needed in addition to the series and parallel rules.Redifon, p.22 ...|$|E
500|$|A common {{analysis}} {{approach is}} to solve for loop currents rather than branch currents. [...] The branch currents are then found {{in terms of the}} loop currents. [...] Again, the set of loop currents cannot be chosen arbitrarily. [...] To guarantee a set of independent variables the loop currents must be those associated with a certain set of loops. [...] This set of loops consists of those loops formed by replacing a single link of a given tree of the graph of the circuit to be analysed. [...] Since replacing a single link in a tree forms exactly one unique loop, the number of loop currents so defined is equal to l. [...] The term loop in this context {{is not the same as}} the usual meaning of loop in graph theory. [...] The set of branches forming a given loop is called a tie set.Guillemin was a leading figure in the development and teaching of <b>linear</b> <b>network</b> analysis (Wildes and Lindgren, pp.154–159). [...] The set of network equations are formed by equating the loop currents to the algebraic sum of the tie set branch currents.|$|E

40|$|We derive a bound on {{the ability}} of a <b>linear</b> optical <b>network</b> to {{estimate}} a linear combination of independent phase shifts by using an arbitrary non-classical but unentangled input state, thereby elucidating the quantum resources required to obtain the Heisenberg limit with a multi-port interferometer. Our bound reveals that while <b>linear</b> <b>networks</b> can generate highly entangled states, they cannot effectively combine quantum resources that are well distributed across multiple modes for the purposes of metrology: in this sense <b>linear</b> <b>networks</b> endowed with well-distributed quantum resources behave classically. Conversely, our bound shows that <b>linear</b> <b>networks</b> can achieve the Heisenberg limit for distributed metrology when the input photons are hoarded in a small number of input modes, and we present an explicit scheme for doing so.

40|$|Piecewise <b>linear</b> <b>networks</b> (PLNs) are {{attractive}} {{because they can}} be trained quickly and provide good performance in many nonlinear approximation problems. Most existing design algorithms for piecewise <b>linear</b> <b>networks</b> are not convergent, non-optimal, or are not designed to handle noisy data. In this paper, four algorithms are presented which attack this problem. They are: (1) a convergent design algorithm which builds the PLN one module at a time using a branch and bound technique; (2) two pruning algorithms which eliminate less useful modules from the network; and (3) a sifting algorithm which picks the best networks out of the many designed. The performance of the PLN is compared with that of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) using several benchmark data sets. Numerical results demonstrate that piecewise <b>linear</b> <b>networks</b> are adequate for many approximation problems. r 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Users generate data transfers {{according to some}} Poisson processes and transmit corresponding packet at a fixed rate equal to their access rate until the entire document is received at the destination; some erasure codes are {{used to make the}} transmission robust to packet losses. We study the stability of the stochastic process representing the number of active flows in two particular cases: <b>linear</b> <b>networks</b> and upstream trees. For the case of <b>linear</b> <b>networks,</b> we notably use fluid limits and an interesting phenomenon of "time scale separation" occurs. Bounds on the stability region of <b>linear</b> <b>networks</b> are given. For the case of upstream trees, underlying monotonic properties are used.

30|$|The {{comparison}} between tables {{shows that the}} average number of trusted and distrusted links grows in parallel, while the related costs decrease in a similar vein across the different topologies. Nonetheless, this proportion is not linear. Trust propagates at a much higher rate than distrust in these balanced networks, and there is a small difference between scale-free and <b>linear</b> <b>networks,</b> where the former presents more distrust than trust cost when compared to the latter. These observations suggest that trust is a more frequent and more relevant property in information transmission than the latter in general, and that <b>linear</b> <b>networks</b> are less affected than scale-free ones by distrust propagation.|$|R

This is especially the case in the small basins located in the north-western part of France, where the landscape mosaic, which includes <b>linear</b> <b>networks</b> (hedges, roads, ditches [...] .), tends to complicate the processes. Analyzing the transfer conditions is important for a further integrated watershed management. Hence, in this paper, we propose to use a multi-agent system as a support decision tool to understand the role of anthropogenic <b>linear</b> <b>networks</b> on runoff pathways. We carried out a so-called bottom-up approach, to measure the effects of the local interactions between each linear element on the global hydrological behavior of the watershed.
