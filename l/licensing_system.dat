5|$|Over {{the next}} 10 years the Stationers {{repeatedly}} advocated bills to re-authorize the old <b>licensing</b> <b>system,</b> but Parliament declined to enact them. Faced with this failure, the Stationers decided to emphasise {{the benefits of}} licensing to authors rather than publishers, and the Stationers succeeded in getting Parliament to consider a new bill. This bill, which after substantial amendments was granted Royal Assent on 5 April 1710, {{became known as the}} Statute of Anne due to its passage during the reign of Queen Anne. The new law prescribed a copyright term of 14 years, with a provision for renewal for a similar term, during which only the author and the printers they chose to license their works to could publish the author's creations. Following this, the work's copyright would expire, with the material falling into the public domain. Despite a period of instability known as the Battle of the Booksellers when the initial copyright terms under the Statute began to expire, the Statute of Anne remained in force until the Copyright Act 1842 replaced it.|$|E

50|$|In contrast, the {{approach}} of European graduated driver <b>licensing</b> <b>systems</b> places much greater emphasis on the training experiences of learner drivers prior to solo driving, with a lesser focus on license restrictions at the intermediate, provisional or probationary licensing phase.

As well, most learner driver experience is obtained through professional driving instructors rather than through ad hoc supervision.|$|R

25|$|At the Restoration in 1660, Shakespeare's plays {{were divided}} between the two newly {{licensed}} companies: the King's Company of Thomas Killigrew and the Duke's Men of William Davenant. The <b>licensing</b> <b>system</b> prevailed for two centuries; from 1660 to 1843, only two main companies regularly presented Shakespeare in London. Davenant, who had known early-Stuart actors such as John Lowin and Joseph Taylor, was the main figure establishing some continuity with earlier traditions; his advice to his actors is thus of interest as possible reflections of original practices.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Palestine Exploration Fund {{founded in}} 1865 {{completing}} its survey of excavatable sites in Palestine in 1880 began excavating in 1890 {{at the site}} of ancient Lachish near Jerusalem, {{the first of a series}} planned under the <b>licensing</b> <b>system</b> of the Ottoman Empire. Under their auspices in 1908 Ernst Sellin and Carl Watzinger began excavation at Jericho previously excavated for the first time by Sir Charles Warren in 1868. They discovered a Neolithic and Bronze Age city there. Subsequent excavations in the region by them and others turned up other walled cities that appear to have preceded the Bronze Age urbanization.|$|E
25|$|Different {{nations have}} {{different}} methods of handling internal and international trade. Australia has banned {{the export of}} its native birds since 1960. Following years of campaigning by hundreds of NGOs and outbreaks of avian flu, in July 2007, the European Union halted the importation of all wild birds with a permanent ban on their import. Prior to an earlier temporary ban started in late October 2005, the European Union (EU) was importing about two million live birds a year, about 90% of the international market: {{hundreds of thousands of}} these were parrots. No national laws protect feral parrot populations in the U.S. Mexico has a <b>licensing</b> <b>system</b> for capturing and selling native birds.|$|E

25|$|Trade, export, {{and import}} of all wild-caught parrots is {{regulated}} and only permitted under special licensed circumstances in countries {{party to the}} Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species, that came into force in 1975 to regulate the international trade of all endangered wild-caught animal and plant species. In 1975, 24 parrot species were included on Appendix I of CITES, thus prohibiting commercial international trade in these birds. Since that initial listing, continuing threats from international trade led CITES to add an additional 32 parrot varieties to Appendix I. All the other parrot species are protected on Appendix II of CITES. In addition, individual countries may have laws to regulate trade in certain species; for example, the EU has banned parrot trade, whereas Mexico has a <b>licensing</b> <b>system</b> for capturing parrots.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 Super League was {{expanded}} to 14 teams, with two additional teams being promoted from National League One. In turn, two additional teams were promoted from National League Two to National League One {{at the end}} of the 2008 season, reducing the number of teams in National League Two to 10. National Leagues One and Two were then rebranded as the Championship and Championship 1 respectively, with the change being implemented in time for the 2009 season. Championship 1 was later rebranded to League 1. During this period, a system of licensing was put in place which meant there was no automatic system of promotion and relegation between the Championship and Super League, although promotion and relegation continued between the Championship and League 1.
