40|$|This {{paper will}} present the design and {{application}} of material handling and automation systems currently being developed for the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Nuclear Material Storage Facility (NMSF) renovation project. The NMSF is a long-term storage facility for nuclear material in various forms. The material is stored within tubes in a rack called a basket. The material handling equipment range from simple <b>lift</b> <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> to more sophisticated fully automated robots, and are split into three basic systems: a Vault Automation System, an NDA automation System, and a Drum handling System. The Vault Automation system provides a mechanism to handle a basket of material cans and to load/unload storage tubes within the material vault.

40|$|Manual {{full-body}} vertical lifts {{of patients}} have {{high risk for}} developing musculoskeletal disorders. Two primary types of battery-powered <b>lift</b> <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> are available for these tasks: floor-based and overhead-mounted devices. Studies suggest that the operation of floor-based devices may require excessive pushing and pulling forces and that overhead-mounted devices are safer and require lower operating forces. This study evaluated required operating hand forces and resulting biomechanical spinal loading for overhead-mounted lifts versus floor-based lifts across various floor surfaces and patient weight conditions. We did not examine differences in how operators performed the tasks, but rather focused on differences in required operating forces and estimated biomechanical loads across various exposure conditions for a typical operator. Findings show that the floor-based lifts exceeded recommended exposure limits for pushing and pulling {{for many of the}} floor/weight conditions and that the overhead-mounted lifts did not. As expected, forces and spinal loads were greater for nonlinoleum floor surfaces compared with linoleum floors. Based on these findings, it is suggested that overhead-mounted devices be used whenever possible, particularly in instances where carpeted floors would be encountered.

40|$|We {{developed}} an evidence-based practice guideline to support {{occupational safety and}} health (OSH) professionals in assessing the risk due to lifting and in selecting effective preventive measures for low back pain (LBP) in the Netherlands. The guideline was developed {{at the request of the}} Dutch government by a project team of experts and OSH professionals in lifting and work-related LBP. The recommendations for risk assessment were based on the quality of instruments to assess the risk on LBP due to lifting. Recommendations for interventions were based on a systematic review of the effects of worker- and work directed interventions to reduce back load due to lifting. The quality of the evidence was rated as strong (A), moderate (B), limited (C) or based on consensus (D). Finally, eight experts and twenty-four OSH professionals commented on and evaluated the content and the feasibility of the preliminary guideline. For risk assessment we recommend loads heavier than 25 kg always to be considered a risk for LBP while loads less than 3 kg do not pose a risk. For loads between 3 - 25 kg, risk assessment shall be performed using the Manual handling Assessment Charts (MAC) -Tool or National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) lifting equation. Effective work oriented interventions are patient lifting devices (Level A) and lifting devices for goods (Level C), optimizing working height (Level A) and reducing load mass (Level C). Ineffective work oriented preventive measures are regulations to ban lifting without proper alternatives (Level D). We do not recommend worker-oriented interventions but consider personal <b>lift</b> <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> as promising (Level C). Ineffective worker-oriented preventive measures are training in lifting technique (Level A), use of back-belts (Level A) and pre-employment medical examinations (Level A).

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 03 This thesis study {{expanded}} upon a 2010 South King Fire & Rescue (SKF&R) department study {{measuring the}} impact of <b>lift</b> <b>assist</b> calls on the department’s total call load. <b>Lift</b> <b>assist</b> calls are 911 calls made when an individual, who is usually older and/or physically or medically disabled, requires emergency medical service (EMS) assistance getting up from the sitting or laying position due to a fall or general weakness. The 2010 study measured an increasing prevalence of <b>lift</b> <b>assist</b> calls between 2006 and 2010. This thesis study supported the trends observed in the 2010 study and also measured a continued increase {{in the proportion of}} <b>lift</b> <b>assist</b> calls after 2010 followed by a slight stabilization through 2014. Additionally, this study observed that the number of patients requesting <b>lift</b> <b>assists</b> on an annual basis more than doubled across the study period, increasing from 152 callers in 2006 to 322 callers in 2014. As with the 2010 study, this study also concluded that the majority of <b>lift</b> <b>assist</b> calls were requested by individuals who requested more than one <b>lift</b> <b>assist</b> a year. Between 2006 and 2014, the percentage of <b>lift</b> <b>assists</b> requested by repeat callers increased from 54. 12 % to 66. 61 %.

40|$|ObjectiveIt is {{generally}} accepted that patients who require biventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> support have poorer outcomes than those requiring isolated left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> support. However, {{it is unknown}} how the timing of biventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> insertion affects outcomes. We hypothesized that planned biventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> insertion improves survival compared with delayed conversion of left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> support to biventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> support. MethodsWe reviewed and compared outcomes of 266 patients undergoing left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> or biventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> placement at the University of Pennsylvania from April 1995 to June 2007. We subdivided patients receiving biventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> into planned biventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> (P-BiVAD) and delayed biventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> (D-BiVAD) groups based on the timing of right ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> insertion. We defined the D-BiVAD group as any failure of isolated left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> support. ResultsOf 266 patients who receivd left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices,</b> 99 (37 %) required biventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> support. We compared preoperative characteristics, successful bridging to transplantation, survival to hospital discharge, and Kaplan–Meier 1 -year survival between the P-BiVAD (n = 71) and D-BiVAD (n = 28) groups. Preoperative comparison showed that patients who ultimately require biventricular support have similar preoperative status. Left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> (n = 167) outcomes in all categories exceeded both P-BiVAD and D-BiVAD group outcomes. Furthermore, patients in the P-BiVAD group had superior survival to discharge than patients in the D-BiVAD group (51 % vs 29 %, P <. 05). One-year and long-term Kaplan–Meier survival distribution confirmed this finding. There was also a trend toward improved bridging to transplantation in the P-BiVAD (n = 55) versus D-BiVAD (n = 22) groups (65 % vs 45 %, P =. 10).

40|$|Background. Musculoskeletal {{disorders}} {{have continued}} to plague nurses in hospitals and long-term care facilities. Low back and shoulder injuries are the most prevalent, frequently linked to patient handling activities. Exposure to patient handling has been predominantly quantified by subjective responses of nurses. Objective. To directly observe handling of patients and other medical equipment for nurses during a 12 -hour work shift. Methods. Twenty nurses working in three different intensive care units at a Midwest teaching hospital were directly observed during 12 -hour day shifts. Direct observation included documenting frequency and type of handling performed and whether lift assist devices were utilized. Two additional surveys were completed by nurses to assess current pain levels and perceptions of lifting being performed. The observed lifting was compared to the perceived lifting with simple inference statistics. Results. Nurses have a high prevalence of manually lifting patients and medical devices but limited use of lifting assist devices. Nurses handled patients 69 times per shift and medical equipment 6 times per shift, but less than 3 % utilized a <b>lift</b> <b>assist</b> <b>device.</b> Nurses suffered from high levels of pain {{at the end of}} the shift, with the highest prevalence in the lower back, lower legs, and feet/ankles (all above 60 %) ...|$|E
40|$|The PLAD is an {{effective}} method of preventing muscular fatigue in women over a prolonged period of lifting Summary A personal <b>lift</b> <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> (PLAD) was designed with elastic elements acting in parallel to the lumbar extensor muscles to reduce the extension moment experienced during lifting activities. It {{was found to be}} a suitable on-body lifting aid for manual materials handling and was capable of reducing the L 5 /S 1 moment in addition to substantial decreases in EMG activity. This paper investigates the effect of using the PLAD during a repetitive lifting task of 45 minutes when women lifters were exerting at a rate of 12 lift/lower sequences per minute. Results revealed that RMS amplitude of the EMG signal in the No PLAD lifting trial increased (91 % for TES and 104 % for LES), while minimal increase was observed in the PLAD trial (3 % for TES and 16 % for LES). The MF decreased substantially in the No PLAD condition (22 % for TES and 32 % for LES) while much smaller drops occurred when wearing the PLAD (4 % for TES and 16 % for LES). The PLAD also prolonged the onset of fatigue in women by lowering heart rate and perceived exertion levels. The PLAD appears to be beneficial for women who perform repetitive manual materials handling tasks in industries as it delays the onset of fatigue...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveLeft {{ventricular}} <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> {{are increasingly}} {{used as a}} bridge to transplantation. It remains unclear whether the use of pretransplant left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> adversely affects short-term survival after cardiac transplantation. MethodsA retrospective review of 317 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac transplantation at an academic center between 1986 and 2006 was undertaken. Left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> were used pretransplant in 23 of these 317 patients, and 294 patients did not require left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> support. Patients with a left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> were supported with a Heartmate VE or Heartmate XVE (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, Calif). Kaplan–Meier survival estimates were compared between the left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> group and the non-left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> group using the log-rank test. In addition, occurrence of death was analyzed between the 2 groups with a chi-square analysis. The results are expressed as 1 -year survival with 95 % confidence intervals in parentheses. ResultsThe 1 -year survival for all 317 patients was 0. 86 (0. 82 – 0. 90). The patient survival for the group without a left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> before cardiac transplant was 0. 87 (0. 83 – 0. 90), and the survival for the group with a left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> as bridge to transplantation was 0. 83 (0. 67 – 0. 98; P =. 77). For the deaths that occurred in all 317 patients, 19 % of the patients without left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> died within 30 days of transplant, whereas 80 % of the patients with left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> died within 30 days of transplant (P <. 01). ConclusionWhen used as a bridge to transplantation, left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> do not compromise 1 -year survival after cardiac transplantation. Of the patients who die after transplantation, patients bridged with left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> are at higher risk for death within 30 days of transplant.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveWe {{sought to}} {{determine}} the influence of the interval from ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation to cardiac transplantation on end-organ function and posttransplantation survival. MethodsUnited Network for Organ Sharing data on 2692 heart transplantations performed in adult patients in the United States between October 1999 and March 2001 were reviewed. ResultsSeventeen percent (466) of adult heart transplant recipients were bridged to transplantation with a ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device.</b> Almost half of patients with ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> undergoing transplantation were upgraded to status 1 A as a result of ventricular assist device–related complications occurring more than 30 days after ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation. Creatinine and total bilirubin levels were less in patients undergoing transplantation after 2 to 4 weeks of mechanical support. One-year survival was higher in the nonventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> than in the ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> group (85. 7 % vs 79. 7 %, P =. 0004). Within the ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> group, survival was lower for patients undergoing transplantation within 2 weeks of ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation compared with those undergoing transplantation later (74. 2 % vs 84. 2 %, P =. 03). One-year survival among patients supported with a ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> for more than 30 days without complications was 91. 4 %. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a significant independent effect of the time interval from ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation to transplantation on posttransplantation mortality and suggested that a period of lowest risk might exist between 1 and 3 months after implantation. ConclusionsSurvival after cardiac transplantation is influenced by the time interval from ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> insertion to transplantation.

40|$|ObjectivesAortic valve {{regurgitation}} reduces {{left ventricular}} <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> mechanical efficiency. Evidence has {{also suggested that}} left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation can induce or exacerbate aortic valve regurgitation. However, {{this has not been}} compared with aortic valve regurgitation progression in a nonsurgical end-stage heart failure population. Furthermore, its clinical effect is unclear. We sought to characterize the development and progression of aortic valve regurgitation in left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> recipients and to identify its clinical effect. MethodsA review of all consecutive patients who received an intracorporeal left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> at Duke University Medical Center from January 2004 to January 2011 was conducted. Cases of previous or concomitant aortic valve surgery were excluded. Data from the remaining implants (n =  184) and a control group of contemporaneous nonsurgical patients with end-stage heart failure (n =  132) were analyzed. Serial transthoracic echocardiography was used to characterize aortic valve regurgitation as a function of time. ResultsLeft ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation was associated with worsening aortic valve regurgitation, defined as an increase in aortic valve regurgitation grade, relative to the nonsurgical patients with end-stage heart failure (P < . 0001). The recipients of continuous flow left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> were more likely than recipients of pulsatile left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> to develop worsening aortic valve regurgitation (P = . 0348). Moderate or severe aortic valve regurgitation developed in 21 left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> recipients; this was unrelated to the type of device implanted (continuous vs pulsatile; P = . 754) or aortic valve regurgitation grade before left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation (P = . 42). Five patients developed severe aortic valve regurgitation; all of whom underwent aortic valve procedures. ConclusionsNative aortic valve regurgitation developed and/or progressed after left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation, with this effect being more pronounced in continuous flow left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> recipients. However, the preoperative aortic valve regurgitation grade failed to correlate with the development of substantial aortic valve regurgitation after left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation. After left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation, aortic valve regurgitation had a small, but discernible, clinical effect, with some patients developing severe aortic valve regurgitation and requiring aortic valve procedures.

However, data on long-term post-transplant survival for these patients are limited. We evaluated the effect of continuous-flow {{left ventricular}} <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> on postcardiac transplant survival in the current era. MethodsAll patients who received a continuous-flow left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> as a bridge to transplant at a single center from June 2005 to September 2011 were evaluated. ResultsOf the 167 patients who received a continuous-flow left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> as a bridge to transplant, 77 (46 %) underwent cardiac transplantation, 27 died before transplantation (16 %), and 63 (38 %) remain listed for transplantation and continued with left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> support. The {{mean age of the}} transplanted patients was 54. 5  ±  11. 9 years, 57 % had an ischemic etiology, and 20 % were women. The overall mean duration of left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> support before transplantation was 310  ±  227 days (range, 67 - 1230 days). The mean duration of left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> support did not change in patients who had received a left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> in the early period of the study (2005 - 2008, n =  62) compared with those who had received a left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> later (2009 - 2011, n =  78, 373 vs 392 days, P = NS). In addition, no difference was seen in survival between those patients supported with a left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> for fewer than 180 days or longer than 180 days before transplantation (P = NS). The actuarial survival after transplantation at 30 days and 1, 3, and 5 years by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 98. 7 %, 93. 0 %, 91. 1 %, and 88. 0 %, respectively. ConclusionsThe short- and long-term post-transplant survival for patients bridged with a continuous-flow left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> in the current era has been excellent. Furthermore, the duration of left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> support did not affect post-transplant survival.

Results of the multicenter clinical trial are reviewed. MethodsBetween October 2001 and June 2004, a total of 39 patients at 12 institutions were supported with the Thoratec Implantable Ventricular <b>Assist</b> <b>Device.</b> Twenty-four patients (62 %) received left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> and 15 (38 %) received biventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices.</b> Indications included bridge to transplantation (n = 30) and postcardiotomy failure (n = 9). The control group included 100 patients from the Food and Drug Administration approval submissions for the paracorporeal version of the ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device.</b> ResultsTwenty-eight male and 11 female patients, with mean age of 48 years (16 – 71 years) and body surface area of 1. 9 m 2 (1. 3 – 2. 4 m 2) were supported for 3938 patient-days (10. 8 patient-years). Mean left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> flow index on the first postoperative day was 2. 5 ± 0. 5 L/(min·m 2). Mean duration of support was 101 days (9 – 597 days). Eighteen patients were discharged after a mean duration of 96 days. There were no ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> failures. Complications included 13 cases of bleeding requiring reexploration (33. 3 %), 1 embolic and 2 hemorrhagic strokes (7. 7 %), 5 driveline infections (12. 8 %), and 2 pocket infections (5 %).

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{sought to}} {{determine}} the value of preoperative left ventricular function and cardiopulmonary bypass parameters in the prediction of left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation after repair of anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery. MethodsMultivariate logistic regression was performed to identify a predictive model for postrepair left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation using the records of 27 patients who underwent direct aortic implantation of anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery from 1994 to 2011. ResultsSeven patients required left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation. Patients in group 1 (n =  20) were successfully weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients in group 2 (n =  7) required left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> as a bridge to recovery. The 2 groups were similar in age, weight, and body surface area. Six of the 7 patients (85. 7 %) who required left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> survived to hospital discharge. Hospital mortality was 3. 7 %. In the univariate model, fractional shortening, ejection fraction, and aortic crossclamp time {{were significantly associated with}} left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation (P = . 026,. 035,. 031, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, the aortic crossclamp time was the only significant independent predictor of left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation. Aortic crossclamp time and fractional shortening together accounted for 80. 9 % (P < . 001) of the variability in left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation and constituted the best predictive model: All patients requiring postrepair left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation had a fractional shortening less than 20 % and an aortic crossclamp time greater than 56 minutes. ConclusionsThe fractional shortening and aortic crossclamp time together predict 80. 9 % of the variability in postrepair left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation after repair of anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery.

40|$|ObjectiveFixed {{pulmonary}} hypertension is a contraindication for cardiac transplantation {{because of the}} increased risk of donor heart failure. We sought to determine whether left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> improve fixed {{pulmonary hypertension}} in cardiac transplant candidates to enable safe cardiac transplantation. MethodsThirty-five consecutive cardiac transplant candidates (age 56 ± 6 years, 88. 5 % were men) with fixed pulmonary hypertension (5. 1 ± 2. 6 Wood units) resistant to medical treatment received a left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> as a bridge to transplantation. Three left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> systems were used (pulsatile blood flow: Novacor [World Heart Inc, Oakland, Calif] n = 8; continuous blood flow: MicroMed DeBakey [MicroMed Technology Inc, Houston, Tex] n = 24, DuraHeart [Terumo Heart Inc, Ann Arbor, Mich] n = 3). Right-sided heart catheter data were obtained before left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation at 3 -day and 6 -week follow-ups. Clinical data and complications were recorded. ResultsBefore left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation, the pulmonary vascular resistance was 5. 1 ± 2. 8 Wood units. Values were comparable in patients receiving pulsatile (5. 1 ± 3. 4 Wood units) or continuous blood flow left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> (5. 1 ± 2. 7 Wood units, P =. 976). Left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation decreased pulmonary vascular resistance at 3 -day (2. 9 ± 1. 3 Wood units, P <. 0001) and 6 -week (2. 0 ± 0. 8 Wood units, P <. 0001) follow-ups compared with before implantation. This effect was independent {{of the type of}} left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> system used (3 -day follow-up: pulsatile flow: 3. 2 ± 1. 3 Wood units vs continuous flow: 2. 7 ± 1. 2 Wood units; P =. 310 and 6 -week follow-up: pulsatile flow: 1. 9 ± 0. 9 Wood units vs continuous flow: 2. 1 ± 0. 8 Wood units; P =. 905). Twenty-four patients had successful bridges to transplantation (69 %, mean time on left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> 210 ± 83 days), and 11 patients died before transplantation (31 %, mean time on left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> 67 ± 30 days).

40|$|Abstract The left {{ventricular}} <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> was {{originally designed to}} be surgically implanted as a bridge to transplantation for patients with chronic end-stage heart failure. On {{the basis of the}} REMATCH trial, the US Food and Drug Administration and the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services approved permanent implantation of the {{left ventricular}} <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> as a destination therapy in Medicare beneficiaries who are not candidates for heart transplantation. The use of the left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> as a destination therapy raises certain ethical challenges. Left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> can prolong the survival of average recipients compared with optimal medical management of chronic end-stage heart failure. However, the overall quality of life can be adversely affected in some recipients because of serious infections, neurologic complications, and device malfunction. Left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> alter end-of-life trajectories. The caregivers of recipients may experience significant burden (e. g., poor physical health, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder) from destination therapy with left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices.</b> There are also social and financial ramifications for recipients and their families. We advocate early utilization of a palliative care approach and outline prerequisite conditions so that consenting for the use of a left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> as a destination therapy is a well informed process. These conditions include: (1) direct participation of a multidisciplinary care team, including palliative care specialists, (2) a concise plan of care for anticipated device-related complications, (3) careful surveillance and counseling for caregiver burden, (4) advance-care planning for anticipated end-of-life trajectories and timing of device deactivation, and (5) a plan to address the long-term financial burden on patients, families, and caregivers. Short-term mechanical circulatory devices (e. g. percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass, percutaneous ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices,</b> etc.) can be initiated in emergency situations as a bridge to permanent implantation of ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> in chronic end-stage heart failure. In the absence of first-person (patient) consent, presumed consent or surrogate consent should be used cautiously for the initiation of short-term mechanical circulatory devices in emergency situations as a bridge to permanent implantation of left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices.</b> Future clinical studies of destination therapy with left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> should include measures of recipients' quality of end-of-life care and caregivers' burden. </p...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesOrthotopic heart {{transplantation}} is {{the standard}} of care for end-stage heart disease. Left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation offers an alternative treatment approach. Left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> practice has changed dramatically since the 2008 Food and Drug Administration approval of the HeartMate II (Thoratec, Pleasanton, Calif), but at what societal cost? The present study examined the cost and efficacy of both treatments over time. MethodsAll patients who underwent either orthotopic heart transplantation (n =  9369) or placement of an implantable left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> (n =  6414) from 2005 to 2009 in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample were selected. The trends in treatment use, mortality, and cost were analyzed. ResultsThe incidence of orthotopic heart transplantation increased marginally within a 5 -year period. In contrast, the annual left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation rates nearly tripled. In-hospital mortality from left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation decreased precipitously, from 42 % to 17 %. In-hospital mortality for orthotopic heart transplantation remained relatively stable (range, 3. 8 %- 6. 5 %). The mean cost per patient increased for both orthotopic heart transplantation and left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> placement (40 % and 17 %, respectively). With the observed increase in both device usage and cost per patient, the cumulative Left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> cost increased 232 % within 5 years (from $ 143 million to $ 479 million). By 2009, Medicare and Medicaid were the primary payers for nearly one half of all patients (orthotopic heart transplantation, 45 %; left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device,</b> 51 %). ConclusionsSince Food and Drug Administration approval of the HeartMate II, mortality after left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation has decreased rapidly, yet has remained greater than that after orthotopic heart transplantation. The left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> costs have continued to increase and have been significantly greater than those for orthotopic heart transplantation. Because of the evolving healthcare economics climate, with increasing emphasis on the costs and comparative effectiveness, a concerted effort at LVAD cost containment and judicious usage is essential to preserve the viability of this invaluable treatment...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesPatients {{with severe}} ischemic {{cardiomyopathy}} (left ventricular ejection fraction < 25 %) and severe ischemic mitral regurgitation have a poor survival with medical therapy alone. Left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> as destination therapy {{is reserved for}} patients who are too high risk for conventional surgery. We evaluated our outcomes with conventional surgery within this population and the comparative effectiveness of these 2 therapies. MethodsWe identified patients who underwent conventional surgery or left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> as destination therapy for severe ischemic cardiomyopathy (left ventricular ejection fraction < 25 %) and severe mitral regurgitation. The era for conventional surgery spanned from 1993 to 2009 and from 2007 to 2011 for left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> as destination therapy. We compared baseline patient characteristics and outcomes in terms of end-organ function and survival. ResultsA total of 88 patients were identified; 55 patients underwent conventional surgery (63 %), and 33 patients (37 %) received a left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> as destination therapy. Patients who received left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> as destination therapy had the increased prevalence of renal failure, inotrope dependency, and intra-aortic balloon support. Patients undergoing conventional surgery required longer ventilatory support, and patients receiving a left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> required more reoperation for bleeding. Mortality rates were similar between the 2 groups at 30 days (7 % in the conventional surgery group vs 3 % in the left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> as destination therapy group, P = . 65) and at 1 year (22 % in the conventional surgery group vs 15 % in the left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> as destination therapy group, P = . 58). There was a trend toward improved survival in patients receiving a left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> compared with the propensity-matched groups at 1  year (94 % vs 71 %, P = . 171). ConclusionsThe operative mortality and early survival after conventional surgery seem to be acceptable. For inoperable or prohibitive-risk patients, left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> as destination therapy can be offered with similar outcomes...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recent {{advances}} in technology {{as well as new}} indications for implantation have appeared in the field of ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices.</b> Progress has also been made in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of myocardial recovery after ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> support. RECENT FINDINGS: Technological progress includes the development of fully implantable pulsatile and continuous flow pumps, either axial flow or centrifugal, for left ventricular and total heart assistance. Among the new indications for ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> support, the most important is the use of the device as permanent treatment for end-stage cardiac failure patients. Increased knowledge has been acquired regarding the effects of mechanical assistance and of unloading of the heart on haemodynamics, {{as well as on the}} cellular, molecular and electrophysiological characteristics of the failing heart. All these findings suggest that depressed myocardial function can sometimes recover with ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> therapy. Ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> support, however, still carries a high rate of complications: the device itself can fail, bleeding and thromboembolism are common, immunity is disturbed and the incidence of infection remains high. SUMMARY: In patients with end-stage heart failure, ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> can be used as a bridge to transplantation or to recovery, but they are now also considered as a long-term myocardial replacement therapy. Which device is the most appropriate for each indication, however, remains to be defined. Even if the underlying mechanisms of myocardial recovery are progressively clarified, the use of ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> as a bridge to recovery still has limited clinical success. Clinical trials with the fully implantable devices are in their early stages, but these pumps appear promising in terms of efficacy, reliability and complication rate, as well as being easy to implant. Because more patients will benefit from ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> placement in the future, anaesthesiologists must be prepared to manage patients undergoing ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> placement or presenting for noncardiac surgery while under ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> support...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: Left {{ventricular}} <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> implantation {{is associated}} with an increased risk of development of circulating anti-HLA class I and II antibodies (sensitization). We investigated the impact of sensitization on posttransplantation outcomes in 105 consecutive left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> recipients. Methods: Five hundred twenty-one consecutive adult cardiac allograft recipients between 1992 and 1999 were retrospectively studied. Of these, 105 were supported with a left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device.</b> Pretransplantation and posttransplantation antibody production, time to transplantation after listing, rejection, freedom from transplant coronary artery disease, and survival were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Among sensitized left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> recipients, 26 were treated with a pretransplantation immunomodulatory regimen consisting of intravenous immunoglobulin and cyclophosphamide. Results: There {{were no significant differences between}} left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> recipients and nonbridged recipients with respect to pretransplantation demographic characteristics and ABO and HLA matching. Among left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> recipients, 66 % (69 / 105) were sensitized before transplantation; in contrast, only 6 % (24 / 399) of nonbridged recipients were sensitized (P <. 001). Sensitized untreated left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> recipients had both a prolongation of waiting time to transplantation and an increased risk of acute rejection. Pretransplantation immunomodulatory therapy reduced both the increased waiting time and the increased risk of acute rejection. However, sensitization or the use of immunomodulatory therapy in left ventricular assist device-bridged recipients did not influence posttransplantation survival relative to nonbridged recipients. Conclusions: Left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> recipients have survival outcomes similar to those of nonbridged recipients after cardiac transplantation, despite their significantly higher immunologic risk. The reduced rate of transplantation and the increased incidence of rejection observed in sensitized left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> recipients are prevented by immunomodulatory therapy. Sensitization will remain an important issue with increased use of left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices,</b> and improved understanding of this is essential to achieve better outcomes in the management of patients with end-stage heart failure.

40|$|ObjectivePulsatile left {{ventricular}} <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> {{have been shown}} to effectively reduce pulmonary hypertension in patients with end-stage heart failure. However, {{it remains to be seen}} whether newer continuous-flow {{left ventricular}} <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> have a similar effect on pulmonary hypertension. The objective of this study was to determine whether the HeartMate II (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, Calif), a continuous-flow left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device,</b> is effective in improving pulmonary hemodynamics in the period after left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> support and posttransplant. MethodsFifty patients with end-stage heart failure underwent HeartMate II left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> placement as a bridge to transplant. We evaluated their pulmonary hemodynamics with right-sided heart catheterization at baseline, after left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> placement, and after heart transplant. ResultsThe mean age of patients was 53. 7  ± 13. 5 years. Ischemic etiology was present in 60 % of the patients. After left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> placement (mean duration, 135  ± 60 days), mean systolic and diastolic pulmonary artery pressures decreased significantly from a baseline of 55. 2  ± 13. 4 mm Hg and 27. 3  ± 6. 8 mm Hg, respectively, to 35. 9  ± 10. 8 mm Hg and 15. 8  ± 6. 5 mm Hg, respectively (P < . 001). Similarly, mean pulmonary vascular resistance decreased significantly from a baseline of 3. 6  ± 1. 9 Woods units to 2. 1  ± 0. 8 Woods units (P < . 001). Posttransplant pulmonary hemodynamics also remained within normal limits, even in patients with previously severe pulmonary hypertension. ConclusionContinuous-flow left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> effectively improve pulmonary hemodynamics associated with end-stage heart failure. Moreover, pulmonary hemodynamics remain within normal limits in the posttransplant period, even in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, adequate left ventricular decompression achieved with newer left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> can reverse significant pulmonary hypertension in patients with end-stage heart failure, making them eligible for cardiac transplantation...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesCyclooxygenase- 2 is {{associated}} with cardiac hypertrophy during chronic heart failure and is regulated through the PI 3 K/Akt pathway. Cyclooxygenase- 2 -induced cell growth through Akt phosphorylation was demonstrated in vitro. In chronic heart failure, left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices</b> lead to hypertrophy regression and molecular changes. Therefore, the expression of cyclooxygenase- 2, phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), and p-Erk 1 / 2, as well as cardiac hypertrophy before and after left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> insertion, was investigated. MethodsIn myocardial tissue before and after left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> insertion, the expression of cyclooxygenase- 2, p-Akt (Thr 308), p-Akt (Ser 473), and p-Erk 1 / 2 was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and quantified by morphometry. Colocalization of cyclooxygenase- 2 and p-Akt (Thr 308) was investigated by immuno-doublestaining. ResultsA significant decrease of cyclooxygenase- 2, p-Akt (Thr 308), p-Akt (Ser 473), and p-Erk 1 / 2 protein expression and hypertrophy regression was observed after left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> insertion. A significant correlation between cyclooxygenase- 2 and p-Akt (Thr 308) expression, {{as well as between}} cyclooxygenase- 2 expression and cardiomyocyte diameter, was observed before, but not after, left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> insertion. Only cyclooxygenase- 2 -positive cardiomyocytes showed significant hypertrophy regression on unloading. Sarcoplasmic colocalization of cyclooxygenase- 2 and p-Akt (Thr 308) is present before left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> insertion and is decreased after unloading, whereas the normal myocardium is completely devoid of it. ConclusionsLeft ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> treatment {{is associated}} with a significant decrease of cyclooxygenase- 2, p-Akt (Thr 308), p-Akt (Ser 473), and p-Erk 1 / 2, and cardiac hypertrophy regression of cyclooxygenase- 2 -positive cardiomyocytes. The significant correlation and colocalization in cardiomyocytes of cyclooxygenase- 2 and p-Akt (Thr 308) before left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> insertion suggests a cross-talk between the 2 molecules in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy, which is reversibly regulated by the left ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device...</b>|$|R

MethodsBetween December 1991 and August 2000, 239 patients received implantable ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>devices,</b> of whom 231 had T-cell panel reactive antibody measured. Panel reactive antibody was measured before implantation of the <b>assist</b> <b>device,</b> approximately 2 weeks after device implantation, irregularly thereafter depending on clinical events {{and length of}} support, and at transplantation. Longitudinal mixed modeling was used to characterize the temporal pattern of sensitization and its predictors during ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> support. To account for nonrandom factors in device selection when comparing HeartMate (Thermo Cardiosystems, Inc, Woburn, Mass) and Novacor (Baxter Healthcare Corp, Novacor Div, Oakland, Calif) devices, we propensity-matched patients according to baseline characteristics. ResultsT-cell panel reactive antibody increased rapidly after implantation of the ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> and then immediately began to decrease. Predictors of higher T-cell panel reactive antibody during support with the <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> were a shorter interval from device implantation to T-cell panel reactive antibody measurement (P <. 0001), female sex (P =. 0004), younger age (P =. 01), higher T-cell panel reactive antibody before device implantation (P =. 03), more perioperative red blood cell transfusions (P =. 006), and an earlier date of device implantation (P =. 001). In matched patients, device type was not a predictor of higher T-cell panel reactive antibody during ventricular <b>assist</b> <b>device</b> support (P =. 8).
