5|$|According to a myth in many cultures, cats have {{multiple}} <b>lives.</b> In many countries, they {{are believed to}} have nine <b>lives,</b> but in Italy, Germany, Greece, Brazil and some Spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven <b>lives,</b> while in Turkish and Arabic traditions, the number of <b>lives</b> is six. The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations. Also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive righting reflex to twist their bodies around. Nonetheless, cats can still be injured or killed by a high fall.|$|E
