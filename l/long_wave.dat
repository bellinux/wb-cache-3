40|$|New {{laboratory}} {{data are}} presented on {{the influence of}} free <b>long</b> <b>waves,</b> bound <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> and wave groups on sediment transport in the surf and swash zones. As a result of the very significant difficulties in isolating and identifying the morphodynamic influences of <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> and wave groups in field conditions, a laboratory study was designed specifically to enable measurements of sediment transport that resolve these influences. The evolution of model sand beaches, each with the same initial plane slope, was measured for a range of wave conditions, firstly using monochromatic short waves. Subsequently, the monochromatic conditions were perturbed with free <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> and then substituted with bichromatic wave groups with the same mean energy flux. The beach profile changes and net cross-shore transport rates were extracted and compared for the different wave conditions, with and without <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> and wave groups. The experiments include a range of wave conditions, e. g. high-energy, moderate-energy, low-energy waves, which induce both spilling and plunging breakers and different turbulent intensities, and the beaches evolve to form classical accretive, erosive, and intermediate beach states. The data clearly demonstrate that free <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> influence surf zone morphodynamics and promote increased onshore sediment transport during accretive conditions and decreased offshore transport under erosive conditions. In contrast, wave groups, which can generate both forced and free <b>long</b> <b>waves,</b> generally reduce onshore transport during accretive conditions and increase offshore transport under erosive conditions. The influence of the free <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> and wave groups is consistent with the concept of the relative fall velocity, H/w(s) T, as a dominant parameter controlling net beach erosion or accretion. Free <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> tend to reduce H/w(s) T, promoting accretion, while wave groups tend to increase the effective H/w(s) T, promoting erosion. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

To this day, BBC Radio Four is not audible on <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> in most of Cornwall, and reception relies {{on a couple of}} low power repeater transmitters on medium wave (e.g. Lanner/Redruth MF on 756 kHz). Initially, the BBC National Programme replaced several local and regional services. However, although it launched BBC Regional Programme for the West in 1933, it transmitted it from the Washford transmitter. In the 1960s, it started an opt out from the then new BBC Radio Four (formerly the BBC Home Service during the morning daily news programme (Today), called Morning Sou'West. This opt out continued, long after other regional services had ceased on the BBC (only National services for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland remained). However, the opt-out stopped with the long-overdue launch of BBC Radio Cornwall and BBC Radio Devon on 17 January 1983.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we test two {{different}} numerical {{models for the}} assessment of the <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> climate inside a harbour, induced by nonlinear interaction of short waves. One model is based on the nonlinear Boussinesq Type Equations; given the properties of the incoming short waves it is able to model the growth of the <b>long</b> <b>waves,</b> and their propagation and amplification inside the harbour basin. The other model uses a simplified formula for the calculation of the incoming <b>long</b> <b>waves,</b> and solves the linearized Mild Slope Equation to reproduce the <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> penetration into the harbour. The models are applied to the harbour of Marina di Carrara (Italy), where a field measurement network of both short and <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> is operational since 2005.

The audio quality diminished as Norwegian transmitters {{were forced to}} share frequencies with foreign channels. This could be overcome by installing a network of FM broadcasting transmitters. The Telegraphy Administration rejected FM, stating that this would require the entire country to buy new radios. A 1949 plan proposed a new <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> transmitter at Kløfta and a national network of medium wave transmitters. NRK accepted the transmitter at Kløfta, but rejected the medium wave transmitters. As {{twenty percent of the}} population lacked acceptable radio coverage, NRK decided in 1953 to build FM transmitters in Western Norway and Agder to reach these areas. An advantage of building FM transmitters was that they could be co-located with television transmitters, reducing the roll-out costs.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} new laboratory data on long-wave (surf-beat) forcing by {{the random}} breaking of shorter gravity water waves {{on a plane}} beach. The data include incident and outgoing wave amplitudes, together with shoreline oscillation amplitudes at long-wave frequencies, from which the correlation between forced <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> and short-wave groups is examined. A {{detailed analysis of the}} cross-shore structure of the long-wave motion is presented, and the observations are critically compared with existing theories for two-dimensional surf-beat generation. The surf beat shows a strong dependency on normalized surf-zone width, consistent with long-wave forcing by a time-varying breakpoint, with little evidence of the release and reflection of incident bound <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> for the random-wave simulations considered. The seaward-propagating <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> show a positive correlation with incident short-wave groups and are linearly dependent on short-wave amplitude.

40|$|The {{statistical}} behaviour of bound <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> is deduced from numerical simulations {{carried out}} starting from local spectra derived from deep-water directional specta.

The values of the heights, periods and front lengths of the bound <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> are obtained and {{compared with those of}} the nonlinear waves associated with the complete second order local spetra. The influence of the directional energy spreading is examined, wich seems to affect the periods and lenghts of the wave fronts more than the heights of the bound <b>long</b> <b>waves.</b> The numerical results of the analysis carried out in a coastal region and illustrated here with reference to field cases from Bowers (1992) show the following: the energy density of the bound <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> increases as the depth decreases, being, in any case, about 10 % of the local energy density associated with the complete second order spectra; the spectral mean periods referred to the bound <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> exhibit an increasing trend in decreasing depth; the characteristic lengths of the wave fronts assume quite the same values whatever the depth. The last result suggests that beach configurations induced by bound <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> are affected by the features exhibited by the bound <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> approaching the coastal region, which depend on the deep-water wave climate rather than on the modification experienced during the shoreward propagation...|$|R

Operational standards usually define that cargo handling for large vessels is possible when significant wave height is below some level, i. e., 0. 5 [m]. However, several ports have reported mooring problems when the wave condition is below the operational level. Many authors have related this problem with the action of <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> inside the port areas. <b>Long</b> <b>waves</b> are known to be the cause of mooring problems in the Saldanha Bay. These waves have periods between 50 and 500 s. This is a range of natural oscillation for the horizontal motions of the moored ships. Therefore, moored vessels at the jetty experience conditions of resonance for these motions during the occurrence of these <b>long</b> <b>waves.</b> Such ship motions can be up to several meters and cause adverse conditions, both for vessels and the fender system. <b>Long</b> <b>waves</b> have been noticed to occur usually together with the storm conditions and the passing of weather fronts.

Analysis simulation experiments have indicated that the amplitudes of the very <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> become usually too small in the free atmosphere, due to the sparse and very irregular distribution of upper air observations. This also applies to the four-dimensional data assimilation experiments, since the amplitudes of the very <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> are usually underpredicted.
