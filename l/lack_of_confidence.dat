5|$|Owing to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in {{the local}} currency, the US dollar is widely {{accepted}} as a medium of exchange alongside the Somali shilling. Dollarization notwithstanding, the large issuance of the Somali shilling has increasingly fueled price hikes, especially for low value transactions.

5|$|The DAP {{sought to}} {{pressure}} Robert Lau Hui Yew over the government's proposed Goods and Services Tax, {{arguing that the}} tax would increase prices for consumers in one of Malaysia's poorest states. The DAP, through its leader Lim Kit Siang also pressured Hui Yew to speak up against the government's education policy, claiming that Hui Yew's choice to have his children educated overseas demonstrated his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in Malaysian education. On education, the DAP also criticised SUPP's involvement {{in the sale of}} the Laila Taib College, previously known as United College Sarawak, to the Yayasan Sarawak (Sarawak Foundation) for the price of one ringgit, when the local Chinese population had donated money to fund the college's building.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of soccer (football) {{in the neighborhood}} flourished after the Southwest Houston Soccer Association {{was established in the}} 1990s. Prior to its establishment, a few adult teams existed, but no youth league. In 1995, Silvia Ramirez, a soccer coach, said in a newspaper article that a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in English language abilities and long work hours prevented many area residents from creating soccer leagues. The same article quotes citizens who believe that playing soccer prevented them from joining gangs. In 2007, Diana De La Rose, principal of Jane Long Middle School, said that soccer was popular among Gulfton-area students. In 2010 the Houston Dynamo soccer team proposed the construction of a stadium near Gulfton. Instead the BBVA Compass Stadium began construction in East Downtown.|$|E

5|$|Undaunted by this <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> {{from his}} peers, Johnson {{continued}} to campaign to retain his office. Although his campaign was more vigorous {{than that of}} Van Buren, his behavior {{on the campaign trail}} raised concern among voters. He made rambling, incoherent speeches. During one speech in Ohio, he raised his shirt in order to display to the crowd the wounds he received during the Battle of the Thames. Charges he leveled against Harrison in Cleveland were so poorly received that they touched off a riot in the city.|$|E
5|$|Vaughan Williams's {{recollections}} {{throw some}} light on Ravel's private life, about which the latter's reserved and secretive personality has led to much speculation. Vaughan Williams, Rosenthal and Marguerite Long have all recorded that Ravel frequented brothels. Long attributed this to his self-consciousness about his diminutive stature, and consequent <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> with women. By other accounts, none of them first-hand, Ravel {{was in love with}} Misia Edwards, or wanted to marry the violinist Hélène Jourdan-Morhange. Rosenthal records and discounts contemporary speculation that Ravel, a lifelong bachelor, may have been homosexual. Such speculation recurred in a 2000 life of Ravel by Benjamin Ivry; subsequent studies have concluded that Ravel's sexuality and personal life remain a mystery.|$|E
5|$|Blamey {{felt he had}} no choice, but his {{assumption}} of command of New Guinea Force sat uneasily with Rowell, the commander of I Corps there, who saw it as displaying a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in him. A petulant Rowell would not be mollified, and, {{after a series of}} disagreements, Blamey relieved Rowell of his command, replacing him with Herring. More reliefs followed. Herring relieved Brigadier Arnold Potts of the 21st Infantry Brigade, replacing him with Brigadier Ivan Dougherty on 22 October. Five days later, Blamey replaced Allen as the 7th Division's commander with Vasey. Nor were generals the only ones to be removed. Blamey cancelled Chester Wilmot's accreditation as a war correspondent in October 1942 for spreading a false rumour that Blamey was taking payments from the laundry contractor at Puckapunyal. Wilmot was reinstated, but on 1 November 1942, Blamey again terminated Wilmot's accreditation, this time for good.|$|E
50|$|Corruption {{and severe}} {{inefficiency}} plague the Mexican police. Further, low pay and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> resources have hindered efforts at improving police performance, battling corruption and professionalizing the forces. A related <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> public <b>confidence</b> has further eroded {{the ability of}} the police to respond to crime: A survey in 1999 found that 90% of respondents in Mexico City had “little” or “no” trust in the police. Such a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> public <b>confidence</b> translates into a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> support—that is, an unwillingness to report crimes or assist in investigations, which is crucial to solving crimes. Nationwide, only 12% of the population has expressed confidence in the police.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} link between the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> {{consumer}} <b>confidence</b> and stock returns during market fluctuations. Using a Markov-switching framework, we first focus on whether the shock to consumer confidence has asymmetric effects on stock returns. We also examine whether the decreased confidence pushes the stock market into bear territory. Empirical evidence using monthly returns on Standard & Poor's S&P 500 price index suggests that market pessimism has larger impacts on stock returns during bear markets. Moreover, the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> consumer <b>confidence</b> leads to a higher probability of switching to a bear market regime. Market pessimism Shocks to consumer confidence Stock returns...|$|R
5|$|Following several poor performances, Nani criticised Sir Alex Ferguson for his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in him. Despite this outburst, Nani {{was given}} a chance to shine and {{provided}} an assist for Rooney in the 4–0 league win over Hull City. Soon after this positive display, he put in another good performance in their League Cup semi-final victory over derby rivals Manchester City, revealing a heart-to-heart with Ferguson had resulted in a better display of form. On 31 January 2010, Nani scored the first goal and set up Rooney's 100th career Premier League strike in a 1–3 league victory over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. Nani's goal was first thought of as a Manuel Almunia own goal by many sources, but was confirmed as belonging to Nani on 26 March by the Dubious Goals Panel. Following this performance, Nani then set up the second of a 5–0 home win over Portsmouth.|$|E
5|$|As the Sole Survivor {{gradually}} expands their influence, tape {{recordings and}} journal entries reveal that despite its popularity, Nuka-World was under threat from serious mismanagement {{in the weeks}} and months prior to the Great War. Gradually, John-Caleb Bradberton, the creator of Nuka-Cola and the architect of Nuka-World, is revealed to have redirected resources to fund Project Cobalt, a weapons development project for the United States military. This culminated in the creation of Nuka-Cola Quantum, a variation of Nuka-Cola made with radioactive isotopes. In exchange for his support, the military agreed to include Bradberton in LEAP-X, an attempt to artificially prolong life; however, Braxton, the general in charge of Project Cobalt, saw Bradberton's prediction of an imminent war as a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in the military, and thus betrayed him. When the Sole Survivor accesses Bradberton's office, they discover a hidden elevator leading to a private Vault. Inside is Bradberton's still-living head attached to a life support machine, a punishment by Braxton for doubting the military. The player is given the choice of shutting off the power and euthanizing Bradberton at his request, or keeping him alive for the sake of Sierra Petrovita, a recurring character from Fallout 3 who idolises Bradberton.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 70 - 74). Many {{learners and}} {{teachers of mathematics}} experience a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> mathematics <b>confidence.</b> Research has posited that beliefs teachers have regarding mathematics, including their level <b>of</b> mathematical <b>confidence,</b> impact greatly on their practice of teaching, and hence on the <b>confidence</b> <b>of</b> their students. This dissertation reports on a study undertaken at the University of Cape Town {{with a group of}} nine pre-service primary school teachers who all experienced a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> mathematics <b>confidence.</b> The study explored how the participants understand the notion <b>of</b> mathematics <b>confidence</b> and the reasons why they <b>lack</b> <b>confidence.</b> Results <b>of</b> the study indicate that the participants' understanding <b>of</b> mathematics <b>confidence</b> is having the ability to do the mathematics, as well as understanding the processes involved. In order to understand why they lack confidence, their previous experiences in the mathematics classroom were also explored. The participants' prior experiences as students in the mathematics classroom have led to a lack in the understanding of mathematics, resulting in the individuals having little or no mathematics confidence. Additionally, mathematics anxiety was an important aspect of their prior experiences. The theory of Enactivism has been used to explain their understanding <b>of</b> mathematics <b>confidence</b> as well as their prior experiences. Furthermore, various coping strategies used during their teaching practicum will also be discussed...|$|R
