5000|$|Bruns {{was born}} July 2, 1846. In 1882, Bruns became {{director}} of the surgical clinic at Tübingen, {{as well as a}} full professor at the University. He was the author of works on numerous medical subjects [...] - [...] <b>laryngotomy</b> for removal of growths in the larynx, acute osteomyelitis, gunshot wounds, limb operations and the treatment of goiters, to name a few.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "thyroidectomy" [...] {{should not}} be {{confused}} with a [...] "thyroidotomy" [...] ("thyrotomy"), which is a cutting into (-otomy) the thyroid, not a removal (-ectomy) of it. A thyroidotomy can be performed to get access for a median <b>laryngotomy,</b> or to perform a biopsy. (Although technically a biopsy involves removing some tissue, it is more frequently categorized as an -otomy than an -ectomy because the volume of tissue removed is minuscule.) ...|$|E
50|$|A cricothyrotomy (also called crike, thyrocricotomy, cricothyroidotomy, {{inferior}} <b>laryngotomy,</b> intercricothyrotomy, coniotomy or emergency airway puncture) is an incision {{made through}} the skin and cricothyroid membrane to establish a patent airway during certain life-threatening situations, such as airway obstruction by a foreign body, angioedema, or massive facial trauma. Cricothyrotomy is nearly always performed {{as a last resort}} in cases where orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation are impossible or contraindicated. Cricothyrotomy is easier and quicker to perform than tracheotomy, does not require manipulation of the cervical spine, and is associated with fewer complications. However, while cricothyrotomy may be life-saving in extreme circumstances, this technique is only intended to be a temporizing measure until a definitive airway can be established.|$|E
50|$|Surgical airway {{management}} (bronchotomy or <b>laryngotomy)</b> is {{the medical}} procedure of ensuring {{there is an}} open airway between a patient’s lungs and the outside world. Surgical methods for airway management rely on making a surgical incision is made below the glottis {{in order to achieve}} direct access to the lower respiratory tract, bypassing the upper respiratory tract. Surgical airway management is often performed as a last resort in cases where orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation are impossible or contraindicated. Surgical airway management is also used when a person will need a mechanical ventilator for a longer period. The surgical creation of a permanent opening in the larynx is referred to as laryngostomy.Surgical airway management is a primary consideration in anaesthesia, emergency medicine and intensive care medicine.|$|E
40|$|Current {{surgical}} {{techniques for}} laryngeal exposure pose distinct limitations. To address these issues, {{this article describes}} a novel surgical technique. Our technique, termed Transventricular Chondroplastic <b>Laryngotomy,</b> allows for extensive and direct external access to the endolarynx. This procedure is described in both a cadaver and animal models. Three pigs were submitted to thyroid cartilage window opening without touching the laryngeal ventricle, and seven animals were submitted to the full procedure, opening a thyroid cartilage window with wide ventricular opening. the animals were sacrificed 20 days following the procedure. Prior to sacrifice, all animals underwent laryngoscopic examination and following euthanasia, the larynx and cervical regions were examined grossly, in addition to histologically. This surgery allowed for extensive exposure of the ipsilateral vocal fold and the contralateral hemilarynx, through the laryngeal ventricle, and thus enabled bi-instrumental handling of the vestibular fold, laryngeal ventricle, and from the anterior commissure to the arytenoids, bilaterally. No postoperative complications were observed. Access to the ventricle was easily and directly achieved through the thyroarytenoid muscle. We hypothesize that transventricular chondroplastic <b>laryngotomy</b> will emerge as the surgical technique of choice in patients presenting with difficult exposure and/or traditional surgical instruments are not feasible. Future transventricular chondroplastic <b>laryngotomy</b> clinical applications of the procedure are discussed including the resection of lesions and more complex reconstruction of vocal folds.

40|$|Teflon {{injection}} {{has been}} used for vocal fold medialization following paralysis. Recently, numerous articles have discussed the complications of Teflon injection, including overinjection, airway obstruction, Teflon granuloma, and an abnormal mass effect creating a decreased vibratory character of the true vocal fold. Multiple techniques for Teflon removal have been described. This report details our experience with complete Teflon granuloma removal via a lateral <b>laryngotomy</b> under local anesthesia. Micro-scopic dissection of the entire granuloma and the paraglottic space was accomplished in all patients. Due to extensive destruction caused by the granuloma, the vocal ligament was resected in 3 patients; it was partially resected and reanastomosed in 1 case, and spared in 6 patients. Laryngeal reconstruction was accomplished with an inferiorly based sternohyoid muscle rotation flap and ary-tenoid adduction. Effortful speech secondary to pressed vocal quality resolved in all patients. Near-normal to normal vocal quality was obtained in 4 patients, with the average "voice desirability " improving 60 % and the effective glottic width increasing 29 %. Factors that contributed to a successful outcome included noninvolvement of the vocal ligament and sparing of the mucosal cover. KEY WORDS- granuloma, <b>laryngotomy.</b> Teflon...|$|E
40|$|Transendoscopic neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser {{was used}} to treat 12 {{standing}} horses with epiglottic entrapment (EE) or dorsal displacement of the soft palate (DDSP), or both. In four horses, transendoscopic laser staphylectomy was performed. The most common presenting complaints were respiratory stridor, cough, and exercise intolerance. Ten horses with EE healed without epiglottic complications; in one horse, partial adhesion of the aryepiglottic fold {{to one side of}} the epiglottis was corrected surgically through a <b>laryngotomy</b> incision. One horse with DDSP had no further signs, one continued to have continual DDSP, and two had induced DDSP. Transendoscopic Nd:YAG laser proved to be a feasible means of correcting EE and selected cases of DDSP. LR: 20061107; PUBM: Print; JID: 8113214; ppublishSource type: Electronic(1...|$|E
40|$|Chester, a 10 month old Oldenberg colt, {{presented}} to the Cornell University Equine Hospital for evaluation and repair of a cleft soft palate. Endoscopic evaluation revealed a very wide cleft that spanned over 2 / 3 of the caudal soft palate as well as feed material throughout his airways. Thoracic ultrasound revealed mild aspiration pneumonia. The palate was visualized via a combined mandibular symphysiotomy and <b>laryngotomy</b> approach and repaired using two mucosal flaps to cover the defect since {{the width of the}} cleft precluded a standard repair. Postoperatively, the caudal aspect of the repair broke down resulting in persistent mild bilateral nasal discharge. The lag screws used to secure the mandible also loosened leaving a gap between the first mandibular incisors. Due to the anticipated performance level of the horse, the owner elected a second procedure which has yet to be performed...|$|E
40|$|A three month old Fell Pony filly {{presented}} for definitive diagnosis and surgical correction of a congenitally cleft soft palate. Since birth she had copious amounts of mucoid nasal discharge bilaterally, hypersalivation, and after nursing, milk was visible from both nostrils. An endoscopic examination of her oral and nasal cavities revealed {{a large and}} wide, central, soft palate defect extending {{the entire length of}} the palate. Thoracic radiographs showed an increased diffuse airspace pattern in her cranioventral lungfields consistent with pneumonia. Bloodwork revealed a mature neutrophilic leukocytosis, with no left shift or toxic changes noted. 	The soft palate defect was surgically corrected using a combination of two techniques; a <b>laryngotomy</b> and a lip sparing mandibular symphysiotomy, in an effort to get maximum exposure and repair of the defect. Immediately after surgery she began to nurse showing little evidence of milk regurgitation, but she retained a mild serous nasal discharge. Her surgical pain was managed via transdermal fentanyl patch, and her aspiration pneumonia was treated with a course of chloramphenicol. Post-operatively she continued to have a mild serous nasal discharge and occasional regurgitant nasal reflux. Her aspiration pneumonia resolved and she continued to do well despite these persistent problems. She recently required a second surgery to repair a one inch dehiscence of the previous repair in the caudal most aspect of her soft palate. Congenitally cleft soft palates in horses are rare and pose a serious challenge to correct surgically due to lack of adequate exposure, and high complication rate...|$|E
