5|$|The royal {{administration}} could also order one temple to divert its resources to another temple whose influence it wished to expand. Thus, a king might increase {{the income of}} the temples of a god he favored, and mortuary temples of recent rulers tended to siphon off resources from temples to pharaohs <b>long</b> <b>dead.</b> The most drastic means of controlling the temple estates was to completely revise the distribution of their property nationwide, which might extend to closing down certain temples. Such changes could significantly alter Egypt's economic landscape. The temples were thus important instruments with which the king managed the nation's resources and its people. As the direct overseers of their own economic sphere, the administrations of large temples wielded considerable influence and may have posed {{a challenge to the}} authority of a weak pharaoh, although it is unclear how independent they were.|$|E
