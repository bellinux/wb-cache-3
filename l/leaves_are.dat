5|$|The codex {{is located}} in eight places, in seven libraries, in six cities in Europe. The bulk of the {{surviving}} leaves (22 <b>leaves)</b> <b>are</b> held in two collections in Paris, both in the National Library of France (Suppl. Gr. 1074, and Coislin 202). Eight leaves have not left the Great Lavra. Nine <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> held in Ukraine or Russia, three each in Kiev (Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine), Saint Petersburg and Moscow (Hist. Mus. 563, and Russian State Library, Gr. 166,1). Finally, two <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> held in Turin.|$|E
5|$|A single plant {{discovered}} by Nelson near Israelite Bay, where both putative parents are found, {{is regarded as}} a hybrid between A.cuneatus and A.dobsonii. <b>Leaves</b> <b>are</b> mostly triangular like those of A.cuneatus, but whereas A.cuneatus <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> mostly five-lobed, the putative hybrid usually has three lobes, with the occasional leaf being entire like those of A.dobsonii (though A.cuneatis itself occasionally bears entire leaves). Leaves of the putative hybrid lack the thick indumentum of A.cuneatus, being bright green with a sparse indumentum like that of A.dobsonii. Flower colour is like that of A.cuneatus but the style lacks an indumentum, like A.dobsonii.|$|E
5|$|Polyphenol phytochemicals {{present in}} the fruit, seeds and <b>leaves,</b> <b>are</b> being {{investigated}} for their potential biological activities.|$|E
30|$|Acalypha wilkesiana <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> {{purchased}} from gardens within Benin City and authenticated at the Department of Plant Biology and Biotechnology, University of Benin, Benin City. The <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> properly selected to remove unwanted materials and then air dried. The dried <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> then pulverized into fine powder and weighed.|$|R
50|$|Under the Standard, sick <b>leave</b> <b>was</b> {{referred}} to as personal <b>leave.</b> Carer’s <b>leave</b> <b>was</b> {{part of the same}} entitlement and could be used to provide care and support to a member of an employee’s immediate family or household. Ten days of paid personal/carer’s <b>leave</b> <b>were</b> available for employees every year. For part-time employees and those who were within the first 12 months of employment, this type of <b>leave</b> <b>was</b> available on a pro-rata basis. Casual employees were not eligible for paid personal/carer's leave.|$|R
5|$|The Knight's Cross with Oak <b>Leaves</b> <b>was</b> {{based on}} the {{enactment}} Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 849 of 3 June 1940. The last officially announced number for the Oak <b>Leaves</b> <b>was</b> 843.|$|R
5|$|The wreath on {{the reverse}} is also derivative, having been {{previously}} used on Longacre's Type II gold dollar of 1854, and the three-dollar piece of the same year. It is composed of leaves of wheat, corn, cotton and tobacco, thus including produce associated with both the North and the South. The cotton <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> sometimes said to be maple leaves; the two types are not dissimilar, and maple <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> more widely known than cotton leaves. An ear of corn is also visible.|$|E
5|$|Although the inflorescences of Banksia aquilonia {{are similar}} to B.integrifolia, the <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> marked in their differences—the midrib on the leaves' undersides is distinctively covered in short reddish-brown hairs and the <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> spirally {{arranged}} on the branches rather than in whorls as in all B.integrifolia subspecies. It was these differences that George felt were distinctive enough {{for it to be}} separate it as a full species from B. integrifolia. The overall habit of a Banksia aquilonia tree resembles that of B.integrifolia, though is generally smaller. The southernmost populations of B.aquilonia are separated from the northernmost B.integrifolia occurrence by , hence location is helpful in identification.|$|E
5|$|Aspleniummontanum is a small, {{evergreen}} fern which {{grows in}} tufts. The <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> bluish-green and highly divided, proceeding {{from a long}} and often drooping stalk. A.montanum is monomorphic, with no difference in form between sterile and fertile fronds.|$|E
50|$|The {{seeds and}} young <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> {{used by the}} Hopi Indians as a food source. The seeds were cooked {{as a form of}} porridge, while the <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> used as greens.|$|R
50|$|Vote <b>Leave</b> <b>was</b> {{the lead}} {{organisation}} campaigning for a leave {{vote in the}} referendum. On 13 April 2016, Vote <b>Leave</b> <b>was</b> designated by the Electoral Commission as the official campaign in favour of leaving the European Union for the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. Vote <b>Leave</b> <b>was</b> created in October 2015 and was a cross-party campaign, including members of Parliament from Conservatives, Labour, and UKIP.|$|R
30|$|While the {{necessity}} for short-term sick <b>leave</b> <b>is</b> often based on the employee’s own assessment, long-term sick <b>leave</b> <b>is</b> usually certified by a general practitioner. But whether an employee actually seeks medical help is usually dependent on the employee’s own initiative. This means that the employee’s sick <b>leave</b> might <b>be</b> influenced by own health assessment and the employee’s opinion of when sick <b>leave</b> <b>is</b> needed. Additionally, this implies that the sickness benefit schemes depend on trust in the employees and their assessments.|$|R
5|$|B.sessilis var. sessilis is an autonym that {{encompasses}} the type material of the species. This {{is the most}} widespread variety, occurring from Regans Ford and Moora in the north, south-east to Albany, and inland as far as Wongan Hills, Pingelly and Kulin. Its blue-green <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> cuneate (wedge-shaped) or oblong, and are usually two to three centimetres long but may reach five.|$|E
5|$|Foreign {{servicemen}} who did {{not serve}} in the German Wehrmacht or the Waffen-SS during World War II and were awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross or its higher grade the Knight's Cross with Oak <b>Leaves</b> <b>are</b> listed in the List of foreign recipients of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.|$|E
5|$|Grevillea juniperina is pollinated by birds, with bees also {{recorded}} visiting flowers. The <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> food for caterpillars of the cyprotus blue (Candalides cyprotus). A springtail species of Australian origin—Calvatomina superba—was found on Grevillea juniperina cultivated at the Lost Gardens of Heligan in Cornwall.|$|E
30|$|Spent tea <b>leaves</b> (STL) <b>were</b> {{collected}} from a tea-making shop {{located in the}} cafeteria. The collected <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> washed with distilled water to remove any adhering dirt. Then it was boiled with distilled water several times until the leaves gave no color. The <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> then dried in an oven at 373  ±  1  K for 24  h. The dried <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> immersed in 0.05  M Ca(OH) 2 solution for 8  h. The <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> then washed thoroughly with distilled water until they were neutralized and dried in the oven at 373  ±  1  K for 24  h. Finally, the resulting biosorbent—alkali-modified spent tea leaves (MSTL)—was stored in air-tight glass bottles for further use in biosorption experiments.|$|R
30|$|Matured mango <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> {{collected}} from local {{area near the}} campus of Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet, Bangladesh. The <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> then repeatedly washed with tap water and subsequently with distilled water to remove all the dirt and earthy materials. The washed <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> allowed to dry first {{at room temperature for}} several days and then in an oven at 105  °C overnight. The dried <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> then grounded with grinder and powder <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> then dispersed in distilled water followed by boiling the water to remove coloring components of the leaves. After boiling, the powder was dried at 105  °C for 24  h and sieved to obtain the particle size in the range of 75 - 300  µm and stored in a plastic bottle for use as an adsorbent.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> {{used by the}} Diegueno and Luiseno {{indigenous}} people of California for food:. The young <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> picked before the flowers appeared in the spring, then boiled, and used as greens.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to a commercially prepared seed mix, a balanced diet for a Campbell's dwarf hamster in captivity includes a regulated variety of fresh vegetables and fruits. Dark greens such as kale are rich in vitamins and minerals. Wild vegetables such as yarrow, chickweed, and dandelion and raspberry <b>leaves,</b> <b>are</b> also good sources of protein that helps prevent obesity.|$|E
5|$|In many plants, {{defensive}} or {{storage structures}} {{are made by}} modifications {{of the development of}} primary leaves, stems, and roots. <b>Leaves</b> <b>are</b> variously modified from photosynthetic structures to form the insect-trapping pitchers of pitcher plants, the insect-trapping jaws of Venus flytrap, and the spines of cactuses, all homologous.|$|E
5|$|Leaf {{morphology}} is {{also very}} diverse in this large genus. Some <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> very thin, almost needle-like (S. affine), while others are short, stubby, and arranged in rosettes (S. pulviniforme). Another group of species, such as S. scandens (climbing triggerplant) form scrambling, tangled mats typically propped up on aerial roots.|$|E
50|$|Personal/carer's <b>leave</b> <b>was</b> cumulative. There was {{no limit}} {{on the amount of}} {{accumulated}} sick <b>leave</b> that could <b>be</b> taken each year. However, the taking of paid carer's <b>leave</b> <b>was</b> limited to 10 days {{in the first year of}} employment and 12 days in subsequent years.|$|R
40|$|Two-dimensional CdS micro/nano <b>leaves</b> have <b>been</b> {{synthesized}} via {{a controlled}} hydrothermal process. The {{dimensions of the}} <b>leaves</b> <b>is</b> {{in the range of}} 4 - 6 mu m and the thickness of the <b>leaves</b> <b>is</b> 30 - 50 nm. The surface of the <b>leaves</b> <b>is</b> smooth and composed of several parallel laminar layers with multi-steps. The SAED and HRTEM images indicated that the surface of the <b>leaves</b> <b>was</b> mainly composed of (0001) plane and all the leaves had single-crystallinity. The morphology of the as-prepared products could be controlled by adjusting the concentration of hydrofluoric acid (HF). The effects of HF concentration, reaction temperature and time were investigated. A possible formation mechanism is proposed based on the intrinsic crystal structure and selected adsorption processes. In addition, the as-prepared CdS pinnate leaves showed enhanced photocatalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation. The efficiency of micro/nano <b>leaves</b> <b>was</b> more than 6 times greater than normal CdS microparticles...|$|R
50|$|One leaf of {{the codex}} was {{purchased}} by A. S. Lewis in Cairo in 1895, 89 <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> received from a Berlin scholar in 1905, and 48 further <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> purchased in Port Tewfik in 1906.|$|R
5|$|Most Hippeastrum bulbs are {{tunicate}} (a protective dry {{outer layer}} and fleshy concentric inner scales or leaf bases). The bulbs are generally between 512cm (2"5") {{in diameter and}} produce two to seven long-lasting evergreen or deciduous leaves that are 3090cm (12"36") long and 2.55cm (1"2") wide. The <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> hysteranthous (develop after flowering), sessile, rarely persistent and subpetiolate.|$|E
5|$|Narcissus {{plants have}} one to several basal leaves which are linear, ligulate or strap shaped (long and narrow), {{sometimes}} channelled adaxially to semiterete, and may (pedicellate) {{or may not}} (sessile) have a petiole stalk. The <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> flat and broad to cylindrical at the base and arise from the bulb. The emerging plant generally has two leaves, but the mature plant usually three, rarely four, and they are covered with a cutin containing cuticle, giving them a waxy appearance. Leaf colour is light green to blue-green. In the mature plant the leaves extend higher than the flower stem, but in some species the <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> low hanging. The leaf base is encased in a colourless sheath. After flowering the leaves turn yellow and die back once the seed pod (fruit) is ripe.|$|E
5|$|Parsnip <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> {{sometimes}} tunnelled by {{the larvae}} of the celery fly (Euleia heraclei). Irregular, pale brown passages {{can be seen}} between {{the upper and lower}} surfaces of the leaves. The effects are most serious on young plants, as whole leaves may shrivel and die. Treatment is by removing affected leaflets or whole leaves, or by chemical means.|$|E
5000|$|Grinding the <b>leaves</b> <b>is</b> a slow process, {{because the}} mill stones must not get too warm, lest {{the aroma of}} the <b>leaves</b> <b>is</b> altered. It may take up to one hour to grind 30 grams of matcha ...|$|R
60|$|Antimony, Tartrate of.--Three <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> {{immersed}} in ninety minims {{of a solution}} of one part to 437 of water. After 8 hrs. 30 m. there was slight inflection; after 24 hrs. two of the <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> closely, and the third moderately, inflected; glands not much darkened. The <b>leaves</b> <b>were</b> washed and placed in water, but they remained in the same state for 48 additional hours. This salt is probably poisonous, but acts slowly.|$|R

5|$|Radishes {{are mostly}} used in salads, but also appear in many European dishes. Radish <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> {{sometimes}} used in recipes, like potato soup or as a sauteed side dish. They {{are also found}} blended with fruit juices in some recipes.|$|E
5|$|The buds are {{produced}} in opposite pairs, ovoid (approximately oval in shape) and pointed, with the bud scales (the modified leaves that enclose {{and protect the}} bud) green, edged in dark brown and with dark brown tips, 0.5–1cm (0.2-0.4in). When the <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> shed they leave horseshoe shaped marks called leaf scars on the stem.|$|E
5|$|The <b>leaves</b> <b>are</b> unbound and {{are kept}} in loose quires. The text is written in late uncial script, in two columns per page, with mostly 19 lines per column, in large uncial letters. Palaeographically the writing {{is close to the}} Codex Seidelianus I.|$|E
