500|$|Scholastic philosopher John Duns Scotus {{argued that}} the only moral {{obligations}} that God could not take away from humans are to love God, as God is, definitionally, the most loveable thing[...] Scotus {{argued that the}} natural law, in the strictest sense, contains only what is self-evidently analytically true and that God could not make these statements false. This means that the commands of natural law do not depend on God's will, and thus form the first three commandments of the Ten Commandments. The last seven of the Ten Commandments {{do not belong to}} the natural law in the strictest sense. Whilst our duties to God are self-evident, true by definition, and unchangeable even by God, our duties to others (found on the second tablet) were arbitrarily willed by God and are within his power to revoke and replace (although, the third commandment, to honour the Sabbath and keep it holy, has a <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>both,</b> as we are absolutely obliged to render worship to God, but there is no obligation in natural law to do it on this day or that). Scotus does note, however that the last seven commandments [...] "are highly consonant with , though they do not follow necessarily from first practical priciples that are known in virtue of their terms and are necessarily known by any intellect ...|$|E

[...] Stylus Magazine called it [...] "a great album, and an outstanding place for prospective new Wilco fans to start." [...] Neumu.net gave it nine stars out of ten and called it [...] "a fierce record". Almost Cool gave it a score of 8.75 out of ten and said, [...] "I'm not sure if it's the work by O'Rourke or the progression of the group (or a <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>both),</b> but this disc is so multi-layered that it's easy to hear new things many many times after the first listen." [...] Billboard gave it a favorable review and called it [...] "a more adventurous and rewarding release". The Austin Chronicle gave it four stars out of five and said that [...] "After a while -- a familiarity period if you will -- {{it becomes clear that}} these songs are not only fully realized, they're damn near brilliant." [...] Playlouder gave it four stars out of five and called it [...] "The most worth-the-wait long-awaited album in the world... ever? Could be..." [...] Uncut also gave the album four stars out of five and said, [...] "The most common description of this much-discussed album {{over the past few months}} is that YHF is Americana's Kid A. In truth, it's more successful than that." [...] Blender likewise gave it four stars out of five and stated: [...] "Tweedy whittles down the arrangements and drops in enough experimental nuances to make the whole thing sound refreshingly lo-fi." [...] Q likewise gave it four stars and called it [...] "battered, bonkers and bewitching in equal parts" [...] and that it [...] "at last finds Wilco's 'interesting' phase become downright fascinating." [...] Yahoo! Music UK gave it eight stars out of ten and said, [...] "Tweedy takes conventional songforms birthed on his acoustic guitar and scrambles them completely, reassembled into fractured, dissonant epics with the help of the reliably brilliant Jim O'Rourke." ...|$|E
