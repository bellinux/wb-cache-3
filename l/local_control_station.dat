50|$|The {{operators}} {{working in}} the unit {{at the time of}} the incident were unable to reach manual shut-off valves that would have isolated the damaged section from a fuel source. A remotely operated shut-off valve was located between the damaged section and the storage tanks but not between the damaged section and the distillation column. In addition, the pumps were controlled from a <b>local</b> <b>control</b> <b>station</b> that was also inaccessible. The pumps were eventually shut down from the central control building but there was not a remote shutdown control for the pumps in the central control room. Isolating the damaged section via a remotely operated valve upstream of the pumps could have ended the incident prior to ignition of the vapor cloud and would have definitely reduced the severity of the situation.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new concept}} of observability {{based on the information}} set possessed by a <b>local</b> <b>control</b> <b>station</b> in decentralized dynamic system. Necessary and sufficient conditions are presented for the initial state observability, present state reconstructibility, and strong observability by the <b>local</b> <b>control</b> <b>station.</b> When these conditions are satisfied, the <b>local</b> <b>control</b> <b>station,</b> who possesses no information on the control inputs generated by the other control station, can uniquely determine the required state vector. Furthermore, these conditions are stated in terms of the system coefficient matrices alone, and provide the structural information of the observable decentralized dynamic system. The derivation of the results is based on the properties of Penrose generalized inverse of partitioned matrix. An explicit expression for the required state vector is obtained as a by-product. The well-known observability condition (Kalman, 1961) is also rederived from the results obtained in this paper. Examples are demonstrated to illustrate the theory...|$|E

40|$|The {{demands of}} the market for short {{delivery}} periods make planning and control of multistage, customer order-oriented production difficult and complex. This is true especially for the semi-finished products industry, the semiconductor industry, the food processing industry, the paper industry, as well as parts of the chemical industry. So far, neither rough scheduling PPS (Production Planning and Control) -systems nor disjoint <b>local</b> <b>control</b> <b>stations</b> have been able to manage the enormous coordination efforts for planning mulit-stage linked production. Thus, the objective is to develop an integrated system from globally coordinated planning and short-term production control with distributed cooperative <b>local</b> <b>control</b> <b>stations.</b> The expected benefits of such a system are reduced inventories and lead times (by about 30 %) and an increase of the delivery reliability (by about 60 %). In the past few years, the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation (IPA) has developed a system architecture which meets these demands. A prototype is currently being used successfully in industrial processes...|$|R

40|$|Telepresence {{is defined}} as the {{sensation}} of being present at a remote robot task site while physically present at a <b>local</b> <b>control</b> <b>station.</b> This concept has received substantial attention in the recent past as a result of hypothesized benefits of "presence" experiences on human task performance with teleoperation systems. Human factors research, however, has made little progress in establishing a relationship between the concept of telepresence and teleoperator performance. This has been attributed to the multidimensional nature of telepresence, the lack of appropriate studies to elucidate this relationship, and the lack of a valid and reliable, objective measure of telepresence. Subjective measures (e. g., questionnaires, rating scales) are most commonly used to measure telepresence. Objective measures have been proposed, including behavioral responses to stimuli presented in virtual worlds (e. g. ducking virtual objects). Other research has suggested use of physiological measures, such as cardiovascular response...|$|E
40|$|Estimating {{the state}} of the power system in Real time is a {{challenging}} task, mainly because, solving the non-linear large power system equations by iterative solution comsumes huge computational time and memory. Online Energy Management System (EMS) these state estimators need to Estimate {{the state of}} the system at very short intervals. Conventional methods like Newton-Raphson is not suitable for such real time application. To improve the performance of SE, certain techniques like AI, Real time, Hirarchial and Dynamic methods are listed in reference [1][4][5][11][12][13]. The most common “Two-Level ” SE technique is applied by spliting the large power system in to sub-networks and each sub-networks are managed by the <b>local</b> <b>control</b> <b>station</b> in coordination with the Centre station – [2][3][7][8][9][14]. Even though it reduces the computational time, still it is not suitable for real time applications. In the “Two-Level SE ” mainly same NR method is used, however, before applying the NR technique, the electric network is physically divided, which results to mathematical approximation. This paper presents an approach to solve the problem in hand without physically dividing the network and/or any approximation on the existing NR method. Single large mathematical problem can be divided into smaller independent parallel task by changing the multiplication method of large sparce jacobian matrix. This leads to a whole new approach resulting in reducing in computing time as well as dynamic memory requirement...|$|E
40|$|Real time State Estimation is very {{important}} part of any SCADA based Energy Management System (EMS). In the SE, the measurement equations for bus voltage magnitude, real and reactive power, are all nonlinear and the solution must be based on iterative methods like Newton-Raphson method. For real time application, SE should able to execute repetitively at short intervals. However, the Power System is highly distributed in nature and includes large number of connected buses. The various measurements taken at each bus are then transferred to the centre station where the SE computations are done using the system parameter, measured data and network equations. one can make out two {{very important}} points at this stage. In-order to improve the performance of SE, in practice, the large power system is split in to sub-networks and each sub-network is managed by the <b>local</b> <b>control</b> <b>station</b> in coordination with the Centre station – “Two level SE” [1][2][3][8][9][12]. Even though it reduces the computational time, still it is not suitable for real time applications. To overcome the above difficulty and obtain a computationally inexpensive real time update of the state vector, tracking state estimation algorithms have been proposed and discussed in various research papers available in the literature [4][6][13]. Many techniques such as AI [16][17], Multi-level SE [11][20] and a few other [5][10][14][15][18][19] are used in SE.

40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} the landscape ecological determinants related to Oncomelania hupensis distribution, map the potential high risk of O. hupensis habitats at the microscale, and assess the effects of two environmental control strategies. Sampling was performed on 242 snail sites and 726 non-snail sites throughout Qianjiang City, Hubei Province, China. An integrated approach of landscape pattern analysis coupled with multiple logistic regression modeling was applied to investigate the effects of environmental factors on snail habitats. The risk probability of snail habitats positively correlated with patch fractal dimension (FD), paddy farm land proportion, and wetness index but inversely correlated with categorized normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and elevation. These findings indicate that FD can identify irregular features (e. g., irrigation ditches) in plain regions and that a moderate NDVI increases the microscale risk probability. Basing on the observed determinants, we predicted a map showing high-risk areas of snail habitats and simulated the effects of conduit hardening and paddy farming land rotation to dry farming land. The two approaches were confirmed effective for snail control. These findings provide an empirical basis for health professionals in <b>local</b> schistosomiasis <b>control</b> <b>stations</b> {{to identify}} priority areas and promising environmental control strategies for snail control and prevention...|$|R
