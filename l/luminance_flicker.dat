Chicks were binocularly exposed (8 h/day) for 4 days {{to one of three}} illumination conditions: 2 Hz sinusoidal <b>luminance</b> <b>flicker,</b> 2 Hz sinusoidal blue/yellow color flicker, or steady light (mean 680 lux). Atropine experiments involved monocular daily injections of either 20 μl of atropine (18 nmol) or 20 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Timolol experiments involved monocular daily applications of 2 drops of 0. 5 % timolol or 2 drops of distilled H 2 O. Changes in the experimental eye were compared with those in the fellow eye after correction for the effects of saline/water treatments. Atropine caused a reduction in axial length with both <b>luminance</b> <b>flicker</b> (− 0. 078 ± 0. 021 mm) and color flicker (− 0. 054 ± 0. 017 mm), and a reduction in vitreous chamber depth with <b>luminance</b> <b>flicker</b> (− 0. 095 ± 0. 023 mm), evoking a hyperopic shift in refraction (3. 40 ± 1. 77 D). Timolol produced an increase in axial length with <b>luminance</b> <b>flicker</b> (0. 045 ± 0. 030 mm) and a myopic shift in refraction (− 4. 07 ± 0. 92 D), while color flicker caused a significant decrease in axial length (− 0. 046 ± 0. 017 mm) that was associated with choroidal thinning (− 0. 046 ± 0. 015 mm). The opposing effects on growth and refraction seen with atropine and timolol suggest a balancing mechanism between the parasympathetic and β-receptor mediated sympathetic system through stimulation of the retina with luminance and color contrast...|$|E

Thresholds for oscillatory motion were determined in the fovea and at 2, 6 and 25 deg in the right field for a small luminous target with and without sinusoidal <b>luminance</b> <b>flicker.</b> At the fovea, flicker modulation up to 80 % at frequencies from 1. 5 to 9 Hz {{had no effect on}} motion detection, except for oscillatory motion at a frequency of 8 Hz, for which thresholds were elevated by about 0. 2 log units. In the periphery, flicker elevated motion thresholds up to 0. 3 – 0. 4 log units at low and moderate frequencies of oscillation at all locations tested. However, both foveal and peripheral motion thresholds were unaffected by flicker when the luminance of the target was reduced. The absence of a robust effect of target flicker on motion thresholds may be accounted for in part by the comparison of activity across a large population of motion-detecting neurons with different direction preferences. Another contributing factor may be the existence of foveal velocity- and position-detecting mechanisms with similar sensitivities...|$|E

40|$|AbstractKelly ((1975) Science, 188, 371 – 372) {{showed that}} a centrally-fixated, contrast-reversing edge has a very {{different}} effect on the detection of luminance and red–green flicker. Red–green flicker sensitivity was ∼ 3 -fold greater for a uniform field than for a ‘split’ field with the two sides flickering out-of-phase. Just the opposite effects were observed for <b>luminance</b> <b>flicker</b> — the split field yielded a 7 -fold advantage over the uniform field at 2 or 4 Hz and a 3 -fold advantage at 12 Hz. Contrary to Kelly, {{we find that the}} split field offers only a very small advantage of 40 % for <b>luminance</b> <b>flicker</b> at 2 Hz and virtually no advantage at 4 Hz and above. Kelly’s chromatic results are surprising since one might expect that the larger color difference (or step) across the central edge would aid chromatic discrimination rather than strongly suppressing sensitivity. We show that the central chromatic edge only weakly impairs detection. Further results show that {{the two sides of the}} chromatic split field are detected essentially independently by red or green ‘blob’ detectors, which do not take advantage of the color difference across the edge. This has a remarkable implication: when wavelength discrimination is measured with a bipartite field whose two side are slowly modulated in opposite directions, then one side may be deleted with little adverse effect...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{measured}} foveal flicker sensitivity {{with and}} without external added temporal noise at various levels of retinal illuminance and described the data with our model of flicker sensitivity comprising: (i) low-pass filtering of the flickering signal plus external temporal and/or quantal noise by the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the retina (R); (ii) high-pass filtering in proportion to temporal frequency by the MTF of the postreceptoral neural pathways (P); (iii) addition of internal white neural noise; and (iv) detection by a temporal matched filter. Without temporal noise flicker sensitivity had a band-pass frequency-dependence at high and medium illuminances but changed towards a low-pass shape above 0. 5 Hz at low luminances, in agreement with earlier studies. In strong external temporal noise, however, the flicker sensitivity function had a low-pass shape even at high and medium illuminances and flicker sensitivity was consistently lower with noise than without. At low <b>luminances</b> <b>flicker</b> sensitivity was similar {{with and without}} noise. An excellent fit of the model was obtained {{under the assumption that}} the only luminance-dependent changes were increases in the cut-off frequency (fc) and maximum contrast transfer of R with increasing luminance. The results imply the following: (i) performance is consistent with detection by a temporal matched filter, but not with a thresholding process based on signal amplitude; (ii) quantal fluctuations do not at any luminance level become a source of dominant noise present at the detector; (iii) the changes in the maximum contrast transfer reflect changes in retinal gain, which at low to moderate luminances implement less-than-Weber adaptation, with a ‘square-root’ law at the lowest levels; (iv) the changes of fc as function of mean luminance closely parallels time scale changes in cones, but the absolute values of fc are lower than expected from the kinetics of monkey cones at all luminances; (v) the constancy of the high-pass filtering function P indicates that surround antagonism does not weaken significantly with decreasing light level...|$|R

40|$|The {{perception}} of a visual stimulus can be markedly altered by spatial interactions between the stimulus and its surround. For example, a grating stimulus appears lower in contrast when surrounded by a similar pattern of higher contrast: a phenomenon known as surround suppression of perceived contrast. Such center-surround interactions in visual perception are numerous and arise from both cortical and pre-cortical neural circuitry For example, perceptual surround suppression of luminance and flicker are predominantly mediated pre-cortically, whereas contrast and orientation suppression have strong cortical contributions. Here we compare the {{perception of}} older and younger observers on a battery of tasks designed to assess such visual contextual effects. For all visual dimensions tested (<b>luminance,</b> <b>flicker,</b> contrast, orientation), on average the older adults showed greater suppression of central targets than the younger adult group.

40|$|Purpose: Neurovascular {{coupling}} (NC) in the retinal {{tissue is}} the mechanism {{that controls the}} blood flow to support neural activity associated {{with the process of}} vision. Diffuse <b>luminance</b> <b>flicker</b> increases retinal and optic nerve blood flow in humans, indicating the ability of the retina to adapt to different metabolic demands. The control system analysis allows the description of the main dynamic features of this regulation system. Methods: Six healthy adult volunteers aged 25 - 62 years were included in the study. Informed consent was obtained from the subjects. Blood flow was measured from the optic nerve temporal rim by means of laser Doppler flowmetry. During these measurements a 15 Hz square wave diffuse flicker stimulation was applied during 1 to 8 minutes through the illumination pathway of the laser Doppler fundus camera. The time-course of the flow underwent a 10 -point lagging running-averaging process and then was fitted with the equation of a modified second-order control system G(s) consisting of the cascade of a Proportional-Derivative (PD) term, a second-order Filter (F 2) and an Integrator term (INT). The characteristic parameters of G(s) to be determined were: the undamped natural frequency ({omega}) of F 2, the damping factor ({xi}) of F 2, the gain (K) of PD, the rate time (Tv) of PD and the integrator time constant ({tau}) of INT. The values for the parameters of G(s) related to the input flow time-courses were thus obtained. Results: Flicker-induced optic nerve blood flow changes could be well fitted by the response of G(s) to the Heaviside step function (correlation R 2 > 0. 66). Characteristic parameters of G(s) were calculated as mean values {+/-} standard errors and the following results were obtained:{omega} = 2. 31 {+/-} 1. 57 rad/sec,{xi} = 0. 28 {+/-} 0. 1, K = 180. 75 {+/-} 11. 76, Tv = 2. 67 {+/-} 1. 62 sec,{tau} = 5. 95 {+/-} 1. 93 sec.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the nonlinear mechanism underlying brightness enhancement, in which a flickering stimulus appears brighter than a steady stimulus of equal mean <b>luminance.</b> The <b>flickering</b> and matching stimuli were temporally alternated. Both were cosine windowed to minimize the potential effects of temporal transients. Subjects adjusted the amplitude of the matching stimulus to match it in brightness to the flickering stimulus. The temporal frequency, modulation, and waveform of the flickering stimulus were varied. With sinusoidal flicker, brightness enhancement increased with increasing modulation at all frequencies, peaking at about 16 Hz at full modulation. The results were modeled by a broad temporal filter followed by a single accelerating nonlinearity. The derived temporal sensitivity of the early filter inferred from brightness enhancement decreased more slowly at high frequencies than the filter(s) inferred from flicker modulation thresholds. With low frequency sawtooth flicker, brightness enhancement was phase-dependent at low, but not at high modulations, suggesting that multiple neural mechanisms may also be involved in addition to an early nonlinearity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSymmetric flicker modulates about a {{background}} light level and effects {{no change in}} the time-average <b>luminance.</b> Rectified <b>flicker</b> is achieved by modulating a luminance-increment and results in both a flickering component and an increase in the time-averaged luminance (luminance-pedestal) above the adapting background light level. We studied the effect that changes in adapting light level and local luminance (within the area of the flickering target) have on thresholds. We measured thresholds for single and multiple cycles of flicker over a range of adapting light levels (Threshold versus Intensity paradigm) and defined their gain as a function of luminance-pedestal amplitude (Threshold versus Amplitude paradigm). The dynamics of symmetric and rectified flicker responses were determined using a Stimulus Onset Asynchrony paradigm. The data show rectified flicker thresholds differ from symmetric flicker thresholds due to two factors that can be contrast-dependent or contrast-independent: (1) local adaptation, which varies with stimulus duration and (2) surround interactions that depend on adapting light level. The dynamics of the thresholds for symmetric and rectified flicker stimuli suggest the detection mechanisms occur early in the visual pathways, involving the magnocellular pathway...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a computer vision-based approach for automatically detecting {{the presence of}} fire in video sequences. The algorithm not only uses the color and movement attributes of fire, but also analyzes the temporal variation of fire intensity, the spatial color variation of fire, and the tendency of fire to be grouped around a central point. A cumulative time derivative matrix is used to detect areas with a high frequency <b>luminance</b> <b>flicker.</b> The fire color of each frame is aggregated in a cumulative fire color matrix using a new color model which considers both pigmentation values of the RGB color and the saturation and the intensity properties in the HSV color space. A region merging algorithm is then applied to merge the nearby fire colored moving regions to eliminate the false positives. The spatial and temporal color variations are finally applied to detect fires. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system is effective in detecting all types of uncontrolled fire in various situations, lighting conditions, and environment. It also performs better than the peer system with higher true positives and true negatives and lower false positives and false negatives...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWhen two isoluminant colors {{alternate}} at frequencies > 10 Hz, {{we perceive}} only one fused color with a minimal sensation of brightness flicker. In {{spite of the}} perception of color fusion, color opponent (CO) cells at {{early stages of the}} visual pathway are known to respond to chromatic flicker at frequencies far exceeding the perceptual fusion frequency. To explain color fusion, several groups have predicted that CO cells in V 1 —unlike the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus—should not follow high-frequency flicker. To test this prediction we recorded from 12 CO cells in various V 1 layers. We found, contrary to expectations, that these neurons follow high frequency flicker well above heterochromatic fusion frequencies. All followed 15 Hz flicker and 1012 followed 30 Hz flicker. For three cells, we tested 60 Hz <b>luminance</b> <b>flicker</b> and found clear responses. We thus present evidence of cortical activity in alert, trained monkeys that is clearly representing visual stimulation, yet is not perceived.

40|$|The {{nature of}} the inputs to {{achromatic}} <b>luminance</b> <b>flicker</b> perception was explored psychophysically by measuring middle- (M-) and long-wavelength-sensitive (L-) cone modulation sensitivities, M- and L-cone phase delays, and spectral sensitivities {{as a function of}} temporal frequency. Under intense long-wavelength adaptation, the existence of multiple luminance inputs was revealed by substantial frequency-dependent changes in all three types of measure. Fast (f) and slow (s) M-cone input signals of the same polarity (+sM and +fM) sum at low frequencies, but then destructively interfere near 16 Hz because of the delay between them. In contrast, fast and slow L-cone input signals of opposite polarity (−sL and +fL) cancel at low frequencies, but then constructively interfere near 16 Hz. Although these slow, spectrally opponent luminance inputs (+sM and −sL) would usually be characterized as chromatic, and the fast, non-opponent inputs (+fM and +fL) as achromatic, both contribute to flicker photometric nulls without producing visible colour variation. Although its output produces an achromatic percept, the luminance channel has slow, spectrally opponent inputs in addition to the expected non-opponent ones. Consequently, it is not possible in general to silence this channel with pairs of ‘equiluminant’ alternating stimuli, since stimuli equated for the non-opponent luminance mechanism (+fM and +fL) may still generate spectrally opponent signals (+sM and +sL) ...|$|E

Altering {{the size of the}} eccentric stimulus failed to equate central and eccentric thresholds at all pedestal amplitudes.

The actuator can adjust the phase angle of 0 ° el. (maximum power) up to 180 ° el. (no power). In a 50 Hz mains the controller switches every 20 ms and shows very fast behavior. As a result of the voltage flanks during switch-on, disadvantages such as EMC interference potential or control voltage output also result in ohmic loads. This situation must be counteracted by means of line filters or the corresponding plant size with compensating systems.|$|R
40|$|SummaryMany retinal dystrophies {{result in}} {{photoreceptor}} loss, but the inner retinal neurons can survive, making them potentially amenable to emerging optogenetic therapies. Here, {{we show that}} ectopically expressed human rod opsin, driven by either a non-selective or ON-bipolar cell-specific promoter, can function outside native photoreceptors and restore visual function in a mouse model of advanced retinal degeneration. Electrophysiological recordings from retinal explants and the visual thalamus revealed changes in firing (increases and decreases) induced by simple light pulses, luminance increases, and naturalistic movies in treated mice. These responses could be elicited at light intensities within the physiological range and substantially below those required by other optogenetic strategies. Mice with rod opsin expression driven by the ON-bipolar specific promoter displayed behavioral responses to increases in <b>luminance,</b> <b>flicker,</b> coarse spatial patterns, and elements of a natural movie at levels of contrast and illuminance (≈ 50 – 100 lux) typical of natural indoor environments.

After 20 s of flicker, the group averages of Vel, Vol, and F were significantly higher than at baseline (pre-flicker) by 12, 24 and 38 %.

However, in one subject, 15 recordings from the same site of the optic disk showed a significant increase in R of 8 %, with a time course similar to that of Vol. Our findings show that, in the human optic nerve, a white matter tissue, the temporal dynamics and magnitude of the response of blood flow to an increase in retinal neural activity are similar to those reported for brain gray matter.

40|$|AbstractIndependent {{channels}} {{respond to}} both the spatial and temporal characteristics of visual stimuli. Gratings 3 cpd are sensed by sustained channels that prefer steady stimulation. From this we predict that adaptation to a spatially uniform flickering field will selectively adapt the transient channels and raise the apparent spatial frequency of coarse sinusoidal gratings. Observers adapted to a spatially uniform field whose upper or lower half was steady and whose other half was flickering. They then adjusted the spatial frequency of a stationary test (matching) grating on the previously unmodulated half field until it matched the apparent spatial frequency of a grating falling on the previously flickering half field. The adapting field flickered at 8 Hz and the spatial frequency of the gratings was varied in octave steps from 0. 25 to 16 cpd. As predicted, adapting to flicker raised the apparent spatial frequency of the test gratings. The aftereffect reached a peak of 11 % between 0. 5 and 1 cpd and disappeared above 4 cpd. We also observed that superimposed 10 Hz <b>luminance</b> <b>flicker</b> raised the apparent spatial frequency of 0. 5 cpd test gratings. The effect was not seen with slower flicker or finer test gratings. Altogether, our study suggests that apparent spatial frequency {{is determined by the}} balance between transient and sustained channels and that an imbalance between the channels caused by flicker can alter spatial frequency perception...|$|E

The reduced stimulation of blue light to the ipRGC 2 ̆ 7 s has also been shown in species of fish, Aequidens pulcher, Labeotropheus fuelleborni (Pauers et al., 2012), humans and macaque monkeys 2 ̆ 7 retina (anatomically not behaviorally) (Dacey et al., 2005) to disrupt circadian rhythms. Tritanopia is caused by malfunctioning blue cones and evidence shows that in addition to melanopsin, the cone system also regulates circadian rhythms (Pauers et al., 2012; Dacey et al., 2005). Participants will be tested for tritanopia using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 -hue test. If the participant is believed to be tritanopic a saliva sample will be taken for DNA verification of tritanopia. Lens yellowing will be estimated by determining blue-yellow heterochromatic <b>flicker</b> <b>luminance</b> ratios in the fovea and 15 ° in the periphery. Data collection is underway...|$|R
40|$|Superior local at {{the expense}} of global {{perception}} characterises vision in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, progress towards discovering a neural mechanism has been slow. Here we used known differences in magnocellular and parvocellular receptive field properties to assess the temporal encoding of information, via flicker fusion paradigms, in those high and low in self-reported autistic tendency (Autism Spectrum Quotient - AQ). A Low AQ group (AQ&# 8804; 13, n= 22), and a High AQ group (AQ&# 8805; 18, n= 17) undertook a 4 AFC <b>luminance</b> <b>flicker</b> fusion (FF) with 5 temporal contrasts from 5 % to 100 %, and a 2 AFC isoluminant red-green colour fusion task. Both groups showed an increase in fusion thresholds with temporal achromatic contrast. The High AQ group displayed diminished flicker fusion thresholds compared to the Low AQ at the lowest contrasts. For the red-green colour fusion task, the High AQ group displayed mean fusion frequency slightly greater than the Low AQ group. A significant interaction between 5 % luminance contrast and the red-green fusion frequencies demonstrated that the differences in thresholds were not simply due to variations in overall attentional capacity between groups. These differences in flicker fusion thresholds are in accordance with reported differences in cortical visual evoked potential nonlinearities, particularly relating to the neural efficiency of the magnocellular pathway...|$|E
40|$|The {{luminance}} pathway has slow (s), spectrally opponent cone inputs {{in addition}} to the expected fast (f), non-opponent inputs. The nature of these inputs to <b>luminance</b> <b>flicker</b> perception was further explored psychophysically by measuring middle- (M-) and long-wavelength-sensitive (L-) cone modulation sensitivities, M- and L-cone phase delays, and flicker spectral sensitivities under three conditions of low to moderate long-wavelength adaptation. Under these conditions we find that the luminance channel has fast M- and L-cone input signals (+fM and +fL), and slow, spectrally opponent cone input signals (+sL and −sM). The slow signals found under these conditions are therefore of the opposite polarity to those (+sM and −sL) found under more intense long-wavelength adaptation. At these less intense levels, fast and slow M-cone signals of opposite polarity (−sM and +fM) cancel at low frequencies, but then constructively interfere at intermediate frequencies (ca 12. 5 – 22. 5 Hz, depending on adapting level) because of the delay between them. In contrast, fast and slow L-cone signals of the same polarity (+sL and +fL) sum at low frequencies, but then destructively interfere at intermediate frequencies. Importantly, the spectrally opponent signals (+sL and −sM) contribute to flicker nulls without producing visible colour variation. Although its output generates an achromatic percept, the luminance channel has slow spectrally opponent as well as fast non-opponent inputs...|$|E
40|$|The visual P 300 brain {{computer}} interface (BCI), {{a popular}} system for EEG-based BCI, uses the P 300 event-related potential to select an icon {{arranged in a}} flicker matrix. In earlier studies, we used green/blue luminance and chromatic changes in the P 300 BCI system and reported that this luminance and chromatic flicker matrix was associated with better performance and greater subject comfort compared with the conventional white/gray <b>luminance</b> <b>flicker</b> matrix. To highlight areas involved in improved P 300 -BCI performance, we used simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings and showed enhanced activities in bilateral and right lateralized parieto-occipital areas. Here, to capture coherent activities of the areas during P 300 -BCI, we collected whole-head 306 -channel MEG data. When comparing functional connectivity between {{the right and left}} parieto-occipital channels, significantly greater functional connectivity in the alpha band was observed under the green/blue flicker matrix condition than under the white/gray flicker matrix condition. Current sources were estimated with a narrow-band adaptive spatial filter, and mean imaginary coherence (MIC) was computed in the alpha band. Significantly greater coherence was observed in the right posterior parietal cortex under the green/blue than under the white/gray condition. Reanalysis of previous EEG-based P 300 -BCI data showed significant correlations between the power of the coherence of the bilateral parieto-occipital cortices and their performance accuracy. These results suggest that coherent activity in the bilateral parieto-occipital cortices plays a significant role in effectively driving the P 300 -BCI...|$|E
40|$|All visual {{information}} available to us {{is the result of}} combining signals from photoreceptors in the retina differentially sensitive to three wavelengths. Such information processing occurs at different stages, and current models have varied levels of success explaining sometimes contradicting psychophysical data for each stage (e. g. {{in the case of the}} existence of ``half-axis'' mechanisms); notably, in the case of color perception, as we move from the retina to higher order processing, the uncertainty of what mechanisms account for a large variety of results increases. In this dissertation, I use sophisticated psychophysical methods, combined with mathematical models of perception, to investigate long-held assumptions about performance-based luminance. Specifically, I test the plausibility of the assumption of co-planarity for colored lights, which its luminance is made equal to some given achromatic light using a task based on first order motion. I use the motion-equiluminant lights so obtained to investigate the mechanisms used by the human visual system to make judgments about motion-equiluminant colored textures. In chapter one I describe a new method, based on minimum motion, to obtain motion-equiluminant lights, and I test the planarity of the motion equiluminant surface. This technique reveals properties of the motion-equiluminant plane that were previously undetected using other methods. In particular, I find that the motion-equiluminant lights deviate from planarity, and do so following a pattern. In chapter two I compare this new method to one used to derive photopic <b>luminance,</b> Heterochromatic <b>Flicker</b> Photometry (HFP). Using HFP I find that deviations of equiluminant lights from planarity are small, suggesting that the assumption of planarity is plausible. Yet, I argue that the experimental data from both techniques shows that the reason for this discrepancy is that minimum motion yields finer-grained measurements compared to the measurements obtained using HFP. Finally, in chapter three I model higher order visual mechanisms sensitive to color, rooted on the differential activation of each of the three cone classes. Using the minimum motion method presented in chapter one to acquire individualized motion-equiluminant color palettes, I apply the seed expansion method to create colored white noise textures. I find that performance in a detection task can be explained by two pairs of complementary full axis mechanisms: one with sensitivity that increases linearly across the gamut from red to green and one that increases linearly across the gamut from green to red, forming one complementary pair, and one with sensitivity that increases evenly with increased red-green saturation, and one that increases evenly with decreased red-green saturation, to form the other complementary pair. However, such explanation does not strongly preclude the existence of half-axis mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{final stage}} of the Adelson–Bergen model [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 2 (1985) 284] computes net motion as the {{difference}} between directionally opposite energies EL and ER. However, Georgeson and Scott-Samuel [Vis. Res. 39 (1999) 4393] found that human direction discrimination is better described by motion contrast (Cm) ––a metric where opponent energy (EL−ER) is divided by flicker energy (EL+ER). In the present paper, we used a lateral masking paradigm to investigate the spatial properties of flicker energy involved in the normalization of opponent energy. Observers discriminated between left and right motion while viewing a checkerboard in which half of the checks contained a drifting sinusoid {{and the other half}} contained flicker (i. e. a counterphasing sinusoid). The relative <b>luminance</b> contrasts of <b>flicker</b> and motion checks determined the checkerboard's overall motion contrast Cm. We obtained selectivity functions for opponent-motion normalization by measuring Cm thresholds whilst varying the orientation, spatial frequency, or size of flicker checks. In all conditions, performance (percent correct) decayed lawfully as we decreased motion contrast, validating the Cm metric for our stimuli. Thresholds decreased with check size and also improved as we increased either the orientation or spatial-frequency difference between motion and flicker checks. Our data are inconsistent with Heeger-type normalization models [Vis. Neurosci. 9 (1992) 181] in which excitatory inputs are normalized by a non-selective pooling of inhibitory inputs, but data are consistent with the implicit assumption in Georgeson and Scott-Samuel's model that flicker normalization is localized in orientation, scale, and space. However, our lateral masking paradigm leaves open the possibility that the spatial properties of flicker normalization would be different if opponent and flicker energies spatially overlapped. Further characterization of motion contrast will require models of the spatial, temporal, and joint space–time properties of mechanisms mediating opponent-motion and flicker normalization...|$|R
40|$|Chromatic and {{luminance}} {{information are}} processed separately by the visual systems of most higher vertebrates via anatomically separate pathways. Research on primates {{suggests that the}} luminance mechanism transmits information about stimulus <b>luminance,</b> movement, and <b>flicker</b> while chromatic mechanisms signal color and detailed information. In order to signal rapid movement, the luminance channel transmits information more rapidly than the chromatic mechanism. While some lower vertebrates such as the zebrafish (Danio rerio) do not demonstrate anatomical separation of processing, {{it is believed that}} separate processing is a basic requirement of vertebrate vision. The spectral sensitivity functions (relative sensitivity to different wavelengths of light) of the separate mechanisms were determined in zebrafish using heterochromatic flicker photometry (HFP). The spectral sensitivity function of the luminance channel was determined using a flicker rate of 16 Hz which assessed its rapid response rate while the chromatic channel was stimulated with 4. 6 Hz flicker. The electrical responses of the visual system to the HFP stimuli were measured by the electroretinogram. The spectral sensitivity functions of the two channels were modeled by a nonlinear regression equation to assess the relative contributions of each cone type to the spectral sensitivity functions of the two channels. In addition, the temporal resolution of the four cone types was assessed to determine if the temporal response rates of the cone types are responsible for the determination of the channels to which the cones contribute. The spectral sensitivity functions determined by HFP showed {{no significant difference between the}} two temporal rates suggesting that zebrafish do not have separate channels for the processing of color and luminance information. In addition, the cone contribution modeling showed no opponency characteristic of chromatic processing. It therefore appears that the zebrafish does not process color information through chromatic opponent channels characteristic of vertebrate color vision. However, problems with the use of HFP to determine the spectral sensitivity function of the luminance channel are addressed. Finally, at the highest temporal rates, it appears that the ultraviolet sensitive cone type processes visual information faster than the middle and long wavelength sensitive cone types. It appears that temporal response rates of the cone types do not determine their relative contribution to separation of processing. This conclusion is supported only if the shortcomings of HFP cited in text are unfounded...|$|R
