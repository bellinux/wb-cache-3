The reason for Brown's exit from the group was that he turned up on the seventh Saturday night of The Quarrymen residency at The Casbah with the flu, so Mona ordered him upstairs to the Best's <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> rest.

Other groups like The Searchers and Gerry & The Pacemakers later played in the club. The Black Jacks became the resident group at The Casbah, although The Quarrymen occasionally played there again and often visited.

In the interior of the house, the forms of the rooms were simple but combined to make a more complex structure like Breuer and Gropius advocated. The house has four bedrooms and four bathrooms.|$|E
25|$|Medieval period peasants' cottages {{have rarely}} survived, while the prestigious {{dwellings}} of merchants and traders {{are still in}} evidence. The urban poor manufactured items in the living area of their cottages. The rural poor, bound to the land owner, worked {{in one of their}} master's buildings. With the rise of a non-agrarian society, subsistence level domestic manufacture became common, and the introduction of machinery required either the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> be enlarged and modified or the addition of a separate room. Requirements were similar for any domestic manufacturing craft industry.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Loretta was {{created as a}} temporary love interest for Dominic Reilly (John Pickard) and was intended to feature only in Hollyoaks Later, the spin-off from the Hollyoaks series. In 2009 {{it was announced that}} the Hollyoaks producer Lucy Allan had decided to introduce both Loretta and Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) into the main show. Allan said, [...] "Cheryl and Loretta will bring an energy and a sense of fun to the show. Both Melissa and Bronagh impressed me with their performances in Hollyoaks Later and I'm sure viewers will warm to them quickly." [...] Loretta was initially paired with Dom and, after ending their relationship, was given links to other characters in the series. To prepare for the role Walton took pole-dancing classes and visited a lap dancing club. After watching girls perform at the club she carried out routines in her underwear. She also had a pole set up in her <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> carry on practicing. Speaking of her research Walton stated: [...] "I loved it. It's really good exercise. It's really good for toning. They didn't ask me to, but I did... I went and I had pole dancing classes. I had a pole put up in my living room." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 6 October 1965, Hindley drove Brady to Manchester Central railway station, where she waited outside in the car while he {{selected}} their victim. After a few minutes Brady reappeared {{in the company of}} Edward Evans, to whom he introduced Hindley as his sister. After they had driven back home and relaxed over a bottle of wine, Brady sent Hindley to fetch her brother-in-law. When they got back to the house Hindley told Smith to wait outside for her signal, a flashing light. When the signal came, Smith knocked on the door and was met by Brady, who asked if he had come for [...] "the miniature wine bottles". Brady led Smith into the kitchen and left him there, saying {{that he was going to}} collect the wine. A few minutes later, Smith heard a scream, followed by Hindley shouting loudly for him to come and help. Smith entered the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> find Brady repeatedly striking Evans with the flat of an axe, and watched as he then throttled Evans with a length of electrical cord. Evans's body was too heavy for Smith to carry to the car on his own—Brady had sprained his ankle in the struggle—so they wrapped it in plastic sheeting and put it in the spare bedroom.|$|E

Povenmire recalled, [...] "My mom let me drape black material {{all the way across}} one end of our <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> use as a space field. I would hang little models of spaceships for these little movies I made with a Super 8 camera." [...] He was an artistic prodigy and displayed his very detailed drawings at art shows.

2500|$|On April 3, 1882, {{after eating}} breakfast, the Fords and James {{went into the}} living room before {{traveling}} to Platte City. By reading the daily newspaper, James had just learned of gang member Liddil's confession for participating in Hite's murder and grew increasingly suspicious of the Fords for never reporting this matter to him. According to Robert Ford, it became clear to him that James had realized they were there to betray him. However, instead of scolding the Fords, James walked across the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> lay his revolvers on a sofa.

2500|$|The {{prospective}} partners either date {{each other}} or in stricter communities {{they go to a}} [...] "bashow" [...] or sit in. A typical bashow scene is that the young man with his parents goes to see the young woman in her house to see if the prospective couple are compatible. Both sets of parents talk to each other, and then when the setting is more relaxed, they go into another room, leaving the man and woman in the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> speak among themselves. Some use this opportunity to actually ask each other pertinent questions, while some just want to see if they like each other, relying more on the information they got from the shadchen or from other people. The number of bashows prior to announcing an engagement varies, as some have many bashows while others have as few as one, which is typical among the children of Hasidic Rebbes.|$|E

Bok was looking for a simplified, functional house, and required designs he published to replace the fussy parlor with a <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> <b>to</b> include at least one bathroom, improved ventilation, and no [...] "senseless ornament". Architectural historian Gwendolyn Wright observes that the publication of these two articles [...] "provided the first opportunity for Frank Lloyd Wright to show his alchemy, converting a simple programme into architectural gold....

2500|$|In the bedroom, Mueller noted {{there was}} indeed a large knife beneath the bed; he also saw an open drawer which, upon closer inspection, {{contained}} scores of Polaroid pictures—many of which were of human bodies {{in various stages of}} dismemberment.

He walked into the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> show them to his partner, uttering the words, [...] "These are for real." [...] When Dahmer saw that Mueller was holding several of his Polaroids, he fought with the officers in an effort to resist arrest.
