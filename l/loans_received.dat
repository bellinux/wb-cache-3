In September 2010, a {{preliminary}} report of the WTO found unfair Boeing payments broke WTO rules and should be withdrawn. In two separate findings issued in May 2011, the WTO found, firstly, that the US defence budget and NASA research grants {{could not be used}} as vehicles to subsidise the civilian aerospace industry and that Boeing must repay $5.3 billion of illegal subsidies. Secondly, the WTO Appellate Body partly overturned an earlier ruling that European Government launch aid constituted unfair subsidy, agreeing with the point of principle that the support was not aimed at boosting exports and some forms of public-private partnership could continue. Part of the $18bn in low interest <b>loans</b> <b>received</b> would have to be repaid eventually; however, there was no immediate need for it to be repaid and the exact value to be repaid would be set at a future date. Both parties claimed victory in what was the world's largest trade dispute.|$|E

One {{of them was}} [...] "interlocking" [...] or [...] "cross-holding" [...] of shares. This method was established by Article 280 of Commerce Law. By doing so, each company held {{a stake in the}} other's company. This helped reduce the pressure on management to achieve short-term goals at the expense of long-term growth. Besides that, interlocking of shares serves as a tool for monitoring and disciplining the group's firms. The level of group orientation or strength between the member companies is determined by the [...] "interlocking shares ratio" [...] (the ratio of shares owned by other group firms to total shares issued) and the [...] "intragroup loans ratio" [...] (the ratio of <b>loans</b> <b>received</b> from financial institutions in the group to total <b>loans</b> <b>received).</b>|$|E

However, this does not occur in the local government banks. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} find out what factors are influencing the decrease of NIM in local government banks. The aim of this study to determine the influence of demand deposits, saving deposits, time deposits, <b>loan</b> <b>received,</b> interbank placement, securities and loans both simultaneously and individually have significant effect on the NIM growth in local government banks. It uses multiple regressions for the analysis. It shows that demand deposits, saving deposits, time deposits, <b>loan</b> <b>received,</b> interbank placement, securities and loans growth simultaneously did not significantly affect the NIM growth in local government banks. Demand deposits, saving deposits, time deposits, interbank placement, <b>loan</b> <b>received</b> and <b>loans</b> growth partially did not affect insignificantly and negatively either. The security growth partially has significant and positive effect on the NIM and among seven independent variables; security growth has dominant effect on the NIM...|$|R

[...] Any money taken as a loan is free from income tax as long as the policy remains in force. For participating whole life policies, the interest charged by the insurance company for the loan is often less than the dividend each year, especially after 10-15 years, so the policy owner can pay off the loan using dividends.

5000|$|The first Five Year Plan had {{provision}} {{of only a}} marginal central assistance which did not play an important part. Due to this, in the second five-year plan, substantial importance was given to it. And in the third five-year plan, the states had laid more stress on planning and had become critical. In fact, {{they were given a}} choice set of various schemes with various proportions of grants and loans attached. This led to an obvious result. The states with larger resources and power could choose schemes with a greater share of grants in them. On the other hand, poor states had to finance almost all their plans by the loans given by the central government. Consequently, there were huge variations in the averages of grants and <b>loans</b> <b>received</b> by the states. A developed state which had resources got 40% as grants; an under-developed state which had no resources got 12% as grants while the average was 22% [...] The commissions did not have a distinct criteria which was used while allocation of resources. As a result, the states were dissatisfied when they realised that the larger states were getting a bigger share in the pie.|$|E

Through the use of SEM, the findings revealed that while the loan amount (i. e. amount received and amount invested affected growth positively, loan conditions (interest rate and repayment time) affect growth negatively. It is thus recommended that microfinance institutions (MFIs) should find proper conditions that will not hinder the growth of enterprises owned by their clients...|$|R

40|$|This article takes a new {{perspective}} on business and politics in Ireland from the comparative literature on business financing of politics. It introduces a theoretical language based on the concepts of ideological and pragmatic donations and discrete and reciprocal exchange. It goes on to discuss {{the extent to which the}} Irish political system generates incentives for these types of behaviour. Its empirical core is a quantitative analysis of disclosed donations to TDs between 2002 and 2009, but it also exploits anecdotal and official sources. This study concludes that there has been considerable scope for the exchange of brokerage services in reciprocation for small disclosed donations. Current reform proposals will reduce but not eliminate this potential, especially if there is no enumeration of commercial payments and <b>loans</b> <b>received</b> by politicians and parties...|$|E

The informal marketplace is composed of two types of investors: family or friends, and business angels (individuals who invest their personal funds at arm’s length in businesses owned and operated by individuals unrelated to them). This article examines the differences between these two types of investors and the impact of their investments on SMEs. This work is based on research drawn from the comprehensive database of the SME Financing Data Initiative. The project is among the first efforts to study the demand side of the informal investment market in Canada. Findings for this profile were taken from financial statement information from more than 800 respondents of the Survey on Financing of Small and Medium Enterprises, 2004 in the following categories: equity financing from friends and family; equity financing from business angels; current loans from friends and family; current loans from angels; loans from friends and family received during start-up; and <b>loans</b> <b>received</b> from angels during start-up...|$|E
