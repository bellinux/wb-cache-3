60|$|The generals <b>leapt</b> <b>away</b> {{into the}} {{darkness}} like arrows from a bow, and presently we heard the noise of gathering men.|$|E
60|$|The {{messenger}} <b>leapt</b> <b>away,</b> but, as I heard afterwards, {{he never}} found Umbelazi, since {{the poor man}} was killed within five hundred yards of where we stood.|$|E
6000|$|... "Leave him to me," [...] shouted Umslopogaas. [...] "Steel cuts where bullets cannot pierce," [...] {{and with}} a bound like {{to that of a}} buck, the great Zulu <b>leapt</b> <b>away</b> after him.|$|E
60|$|The two Malays <b>leaped</b> <b>away</b> {{from each}} other in their surprise.|$|R
60|$|She {{wrenched}} herself free, and <b>leaped</b> <b>away</b> from him. Her {{face was}} bright now, {{and the promise}} of smiles was made good.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's your chance," [...] whispered Wallop to the cadets. [...] "Quick, now; {{or he may}} <b>leap</b> <b>away</b> {{before you}} can say Jack Robinson." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus, one night, just as Marie {{was about}} to enter the wagon where the women slept, a great lion, desperate with hunger, sprang over the fence. She <b>leapt</b> <b>away</b> from the beast, and in so doing caught her foot and fell down, whereon the lion came for her. In another few seconds she would have been dead, or carried off living.|$|E
6000|$|The slave {{put down}} his hand, and setting her foot in it, the little woman sprang on {{to the back of}} the great stallion, which knew and loved her as a dog might do, for she had tended it day and night when it was ill from the {{sickness}} we call [...] "thick head," [...] and without doubt had saved its life by her skill. Then, gripping its shoulders with her knees, Sihamba shook the reins and called aloud to the schimmel, waving the black rod she always carried in her hand, so that the fiery beast, having plunged once, <b>leapt</b> <b>away</b> like an antelope, and in another minute was nothing but a speck racing towards the mountains.|$|E
60|$|Evan stood rooted {{upon the}} road, {{literally}} like some heavy statue hewn {{there in the}} age of the Druids. It seemed impossible that he should ever move. Turnbull grew restless with this rigidity, and at last, after calling his companion twice or thrice, went up and clapped him impatiently on one of his big shoulders. Evan winced and <b>leapt</b> <b>away</b> from him with a repulsion which was not the hate of an unclean thing nor the dread of a dangerous one, but was a spasm of awe and separation from something from which he was now sundered as by the sword of God. He did not hate the atheist; it is possible that he loved him. But Turnbull was now something more dreadful than an enemy: he was a thing sealed and devoted--a thing now hopelessly doomed to be either a corpse or an executioner.|$|E
50|$|Another defense {{mechanism}} to avoid predation or unfavorable conditions is using its legs to <b>leap</b> <b>away</b> and then roll with its legs tucked up.|$|R
60|$|The lad <b>leaped</b> <b>away</b> {{to escape}} the great mass of falling silk and ropes. Soon the balloon lay a flat mass where it had struck.|$|R
50|$|Race 2 {{was held}} on Saturday 8 November 2008. Whincup <b>leap</b> <b>away</b> with Ingall in pursuit ahead of battling pair Courtney and Lowndes with Johnson. Holdsworth overtook Van Gisbergen for sixth.|$|R
6000|$|I felt an odd stab of emotion. A {{sense of}} how we had galled each other, and {{particularly}} how I must have galled him, came to me. [...] "Confound it," [...] thought I, [...] "we might have done better!" [...] I was {{on the point of}} asking him to shake hands--for that, somehow, was how I felt just then--when he put his feet together and <b>leapt</b> <b>away</b> from me towards the north. He seemed to drift through the air as a dead leaf would do, fell lightly, and leapt again. I stood for a moment watching him, then faced westward reluctantly, pulled myself together, and with something of the feeling of a man who leaps into icy water, selected a leaping point, and plunged forward to explore my solitary half of the moon world. I dropped rather clumsily among rocks, stood up and looked about me, clambered on to a rocky slab, and leapt again....|$|E
6000|$|What here {{concerns}} us is, Friedrich's {{feelings on}} hearing of it; which no reader can now imagine. Horror, amazement, pity, very poignant; grief for one's hapless friend Peter, for one's still more hapless self! [...] "The Sisyphus stone, {{which we had}} got dragged to the top, the chains all beautifully slack these three months past,--has it <b>leapt</b> <b>away</b> again? And {{on the eve of}} Burkersdorf, and our grand Daun problem!" [...] Truly, the Destinies have been quite dramatic with this King, and have contrived the moment of hitting him to the heart. He passionately entreats Czernichef to be helpful to him,--which Czernichef would fain be, only how can he? To be helpful; at least to keep the matter absolutely secret yet for some hours: this the obliging Czernichef will do. And Friedrich remains, Czernichef having promised this, in the throes of desperate consideration and uncertainty, hour after hour,--how many hours I do not know. It is confidently said, [Retzow, ii. 415.] Friedrich had the thought of forcibly disarming Czernichef and his 20,000:--in which case he must have given up the Daun Enterprise; for without Czernichef as a positive quantity, much more with Czernichef as a negative, it is impossible. But, at any rate, most luckily for himself, he came upon a milder thought: [...] "Stay with us yet three days, merely in the semblance of Allies, no service required of you, but keeping the matter a dead secret;--on the fourth day go, with my eternal thanks!" [...] This is his milder proposal; urged with his best efforts upon the obliging Czernichef: who is in huge difficulty, and sees it to be at peril of his head, but generously consents. It is the same Czernichef who got lodged in Custrin cellars, on one occasion: know, O King,--the King, before this, does begin to know,--that Russians too can have something of heroic, and can recognize a hero when they see him! In this fine way does Friedrich get the frightful chasm, or sudden gap of the ground under him, bridged over for the moment; and proceeds upon Burkersdorf all the same.|$|E
50|$|A CME {{exploded}} from {{the vicinity of}} sunspot 1164 during the late hours of March 7, 2011. It <b>leapt</b> <b>away</b> from the Sun traveling ~2200 km/s, making it the fastest CME since September 2005.|$|E
50|$|Indirana {{species are}} small and slender-bodied frogs. They are {{typically}} found in leaf litter or near streams. The tadpoles have hind limbs and finless tails, {{and are able to}} <b>leap</b> <b>away</b> to escape threats.|$|R
60|$|White Fang snarled at {{the sound}} of his voice, but this time did not <b>leap</b> <b>away</b> from under the hand that was caressing his head and {{the back of his neck}} with long, {{soothing}} strokes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look out, a post {{is coming}} down!" [...] cried Dick, warningly, and Sam had just {{time enough to}} <b>leap</b> <b>away</b> when the corner post of the piazza fell, {{allowing}} the roof above to sag several inches.|$|R
50|$|At the restart Whincup, Lowndes and Todd Kelly <b>leapt</b> <b>away</b> while {{further back}} in the field on the second lap contact between Tander and Winterbottom saw Tander spun {{in front of the}} pack. Tander dropped to the tail of the field while Winterbottom was {{assigned}} a drive-through penalty. Coulthard stopped out on the track trying to limp a car home with a punctured front right tyre and Patrizi spun Jack Perkins around.|$|E
50|$|Race 1 {{was held}} on Friday 7 November 2008. Whincup <b>leapt</b> <b>away</b> while a fierce dice erupted between Lowndes, Todd Kelly and Tander. A {{forceful}} move on the second lap saw Kelly muscle his way past Lowndes and Tander. Steven Johnson slipped into third behind Kelly as Tander and Lowndes were slow away from the hairpin. Further back in the pack a tangle saw Michael Patrizi and Mark Skaife spun backwards, also tangling with Michael Caruso, Jason Richards and Andrew Thompson, bringing out the safety car. Skaife, Richards and Patrizi had too much damage to continue.|$|E
50|$|Though warned, the Squad {{thought they}} would be able to protect themselves; They were wrong. NM-E {{attacked}} the Squad without warning, during a party at Forsa's house in Encino. Within minutes, NM-E had killed several of the partygoers, before Forsa threw it into a nearby aqueduct. The Squad attacked it, but were no match for NM-E. Forsa was impaled, Starburst unconscious, Hardcase suffered from multiple broken bones, and D.J. Blast was near death. In a desperate measure, D.J. Blast created his most powerful explosion, vaporizing himself and NM-E in the blast, while Hardcase <b>leapt</b> <b>away</b> carrying Starburst. Hardcase retired from ultra-heroics soon after, though his retirement was only for a short time.|$|E
50|$|Superman sends another ship {{into the}} sea, but is buried under steel girders. Lois {{is taken out}} for {{execution}} with her hands tied. As Superman digs himself out she walks {{against the wall and}} is blindfolded. Superman sees the notice and is fired on, but <b>leaps</b> <b>away.</b> He shields Lois just as the bullets are fired, and <b>leaps</b> <b>away</b> with her. On a ship landing in America Lois is interviewed. She is asked by a reporter if Clark got away, but says he is still over there but Superman promised to look after him. As the Eleventh Hour strikes in Japan there is another explosion.|$|R
60|$|Now at {{that moment}} the dog, Houdaine, was aware of the savor of Sir Tristram; {{wherefore}} he <b>leaped</b> <b>away</b> from the Lady Belle Isoult and ran to Sir Tristram and smelt very eagerly of him. And with that he knew his master.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look out! you'll {{have your}} leg broken!" [...] yelled Phil. But Dave {{was on his}} guard, and, as the pony dropped, he <b>leaped</b> <b>away</b> to safety. Then, as the animal arose once more, the youth grabbed the saddle and vaulted into the seat.|$|R
50|$|Rather than be deported, Frank {{broke free}} from {{detention}} and <b>leapt</b> <b>away.</b> Deciding that the intolerance {{of the world}} was oppressing him, Frank embraced a life of crime and declared himself the Kangaroo. Needing {{to make a name for}} himself, Frank then attacked several guards and stole their ward: a briefcase containing only a vial. While the Kangaroo pocketed the vial, thinking it to contain jewels, the vial actually contained an experimental bacteria which would unleash a devastating plague if set free. The Kangaroo was unhappy with his small amount of loot, and sought out another target, this time for cash. While attacking a group of people for their money, the Kangaroo encountered and began to battle Spider-Man. While the Kangaroo was not especially challenging for Spider-Man, he knew that the Kangaroo had stolen the vial of bacteria, and pulled his punches to prevent the vial from being shattered. After trading blows with his opponent and attempting to reason with him, Spider-Man then webbed up the Kangaroo and held him upside down until the vial dropped. While Spider-Man was busy with returning the vial, the Kangaroo absconded.|$|E
50|$|The Kangaroo's defeat {{threw him}} into a deep depression, {{resulting}} in Frank becoming a vagrant in New York City. While watching Spider-Man swing by, Frank reflected on his defeat and wished for a means to defeat Spider-Man. Shortly thereafter, Frank was approached by one Dr. Jonas Harrow who wished to enhance the Kangaroo to a superhuman level. Frank agreed. After a seven-hour procedure, Frank found himself gifted with air jet-enhanced leaping and punching ability. Harrow {{wanted to use the}} Kangaroo as muscle, but the newly-empowered Kangaroo resented being anyone's pawn. Smacking Dr. Harrow aside, the Kangaroo <b>leapt</b> <b>away</b> to pursue Spider-Man. Upon finding Spider-Man, the Kangaroo battled the web-slinger, who had underestimated his previously underpowered enemy. As the Kangaroo was gaining the upper-hand however, Dr. Harrow activated an implant in Oliver's brain which caused him great pain. Forced by Dr. Harrow to obey him or suffer agony, the Kangaroo returned and was then ordered to retrieve a radioactive isotope. While breaking into the Hudson River lab which held the isotope, Frank once again encountered Spider-Man. As the two battled, Spider-Man found himself outmatched, and attempted to convince the Kangaroo of the dangers of the isotope's radiation. Refusing to listen to his enemy, the Kangaroo burst into the room which held the isotope and was reduced to a pile of ashes upon exposure to the radiation.|$|E
60|$|He <b>leaped</b> <b>away,</b> {{sniffing}} in likely {{places where}} experience {{had taught him}} cockroaches and rats might be. Yet it quickly dawned on {{him that it was}} not such things Skipper was after. His heart was wild with desire to serve, and, without clear purpose, he began sniffing legs of black boys.|$|R
60|$|Our captive {{did not yet}} {{show any}} signs of {{becoming}} tame. No sooner was he free of the buckskin thongs than he <b>leaped</b> <b>away,</b> only to be pulled up by the halter. Then he rolled over and over, clawing at the chain, and squirming to get {{his head out of}} the collar.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is our Ruth. Thou knowest, Mark, {{that she}} may not be left alone, for we fear her return to the forest. She is like some ill-tamed fawn, that would be apt to <b>leap</b> <b>away</b> at the first {{well-known}} sound from the woods. Even now, I fear that we are too much asunder.|$|R
50|$|A film without color, {{a boy and}} a girl must {{abandon their}} {{friendship}} to pursue their dreams. In this short animation, a young boy takes a flying <b>leap</b> <b>away</b> from normal, waves goodbye to his classmates, and disappears into the cityscape and beyond. At the same time, a young girl is inspired to reinvent her space with art.|$|R
60|$|Pan was {{wrenched}} out of {{the ecstasy}} of that moment by the pound of hoofs and the crashing of brush. He could not disengage himself before a horse and rider were upon them. Nevertheless Pan recognized the intruder and <b>leaped</b> <b>away</b> from the bench with the instinctive swiftness for defense that had been ingrained in him.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} the bear had {{swallowed}} the larger portion of the bun given to him. It was the more peppery of the two, and it brought tears to the beast's eyes. With a roar of rage he, turned and shook the monkey from his head and <b>leaped</b> <b>away</b> from his keeper, dragging his chain after him.|$|R
50|$|Bugaboo {{may fall}} from any {{distance}} without dying. The {{only way for}} the player to lose a life is for Bugaboo {{to make contact with}} the large, yellow dragon which wanders around the cave. Bugaboo can escape the dragon by carefully <b>leaping</b> <b>away,</b> or by taking refuge inside one of the smaller caverns that are located around the play area.|$|R
60|$|The book lying open on Heyst's knee slipped {{suddenly}} {{and he made}} a sharp movement to catch it up. Wang was unable to see the reason of this because of the table, and <b>leaped</b> <b>away</b> from what seemed to him a threatening symptom. When Heyst looked up, the Chinaman was already at the door facing the room, not frightened, but alert.|$|R
60|$|She {{struggled}} {{free and}} <b>leaped</b> <b>away</b> from him, panting, while he tore open {{his coat and}} drew forth something which gleamed in the lantern's rays--a silver locket. Cynthia scarcely saw it. Her blood was throbbing in her temples, she could not reason, {{but she knew that}} the appeal for the sake of which she had stooped must be delivered now.|$|R
5000|$|..... a key film in {{the story}} of Australian movies. It {{represents}} a kind of liberation point - a <b>leap</b> <b>away</b> from naturalism and the historical realism of the 'new wave’ of the 1970s, towards the modernism of the 1990s. To say it was ahead of its time is an understatement - the boldness of its metaphors and the sharpness of its satire were too much for many people in 1985." ...|$|R
