Here we demonstrate individual atomic features inside the gap of a plasmonic nano-assembly <b>localise</b> <b>light</b> to volumes well below 1 nm 3 (‘picocavities’), enabling optical experiments on the atomic scale. These atomic features are dynamically formed and disassembled by laser irradiation. While unstable at room temperature, picocavities can be stabilised at cryogenic temperatures, allowing single atomic cavities to be probed for many minutes. Unlike traditional optomechanical resonators, such extreme optical confinement yields million-fold-enhanced optomechanical coupling between the picocavity field and vibrations of individual molecular bonds.

Using an effective diffusion approximation for the flow we derive an analytic expression for the phototactic gain (increase in light exposure over the aggregate) and by extension an accurate prediction for the fractal dimension based on the properties of the advection dynamics and the statistics of the attracting field.

40|$|Hot {{charge carrier}} {{extraction}} from metallic nanostructures {{is a very}} promising approach for applications in photo-catalysis, photovoltaics and photodetection. One limitation is that many metallic nanostructures support a single plasmon resonance thus restricting the light-to-charge-carrier activity to a spectral band. Here we demonstrate that a monolayer of plasmonic nanoparticles can be assembled on a multi-stack layered configuration to achieve broad-band, near-unit light absorption, which is spatially localised on the nanoparticle layer. We show that this enhanced light absorbance leads to ∼ 40 -fold increases in the photon-to-electron conversion efficiency by the plasmonic nanostructures. We developed a model that successfully captures the essential physics of the plasmonic hot-electron charge generation and separation in these structures. This model also allowed us to establish that efficient hot carrier extraction is limited to spectral regions where the photons possessing energies higher than the Schottky junctions and the <b>localised</b> <b>light</b> absorption of the metal nanoparticles overlap.

40|$|Plasmonic {{nanostructures}} are {{an important}} class of nanophotonic components capable of <b>localising</b> <b>light</b> near a metal interface on subwavelength scales. Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are confmed to the metal interface and can only be studied {{in the past in}} the far-field by indirect investigation of the light resulting from their scattering. They can be studied directly using optical near-field microscopy which is capable of detecting the optical field in proximity to the surface, with sub-wavelength spatial resolution. We have developed a new tool for the investigation of surface plasmonic polaritons in a broad spectral range, the hyperspectral scanning near- field optical microscope, capable of simultaneously recording multiple near-field images in the 500 - 800 nm spectral wavelength range. Using this microscope, the Bloch mode formation in plasmonic crystals, periodically structured metal films, have been studied along with the SPP excitation by the crystals. The role of the film thickness and crystal lattice has been studied in both the far-field and near-field. Novel plasmonic crystals with exotic lattices have been designed which provides additional advantages over the standard square lattice crystals in terms of band structure engineering and designing flat SPP bands, advantageous for applications in light extraction and unidirectional transmission. SNOM has then been used to demonstrate the new plasmonic platform based on VCSEL light source, showing direct SPP excitation on the laser surface and their efficient guiding. Multimode and single mode waveguides, Y -splitters and Mach-Zehnder interferometer configurations wen: realised. Plasmonic waveguide-ring resonators were studied incorporating non linear optical materials and optical switching has been demonstrated. The developed hyperspectral SNOM is a powerful technique for understanding the optical properties of plasmonic nanostructures and evaluating their nanophotonic capabilities.

40|$|We {{present the}} fabrication, {{characterisation}} {{and performance of}} four novel ionic liquid polymer gels (ionogels) as photo-actuated valves incorporated into micro-fluidic manifolds. The ionogels incorporate benzospiropyran units and phosphonium-based ionic liquids. Each ionogel is photo-polymerised in situ in the channels of a poly(methyl methacrylate) micro-fluidic device, generating a manifold incorporating four different micro-valves. The valves are actuated by simply applying <b>localised</b> white <b>light</b> irradiation, meaning that no physical contact between the actuation impulse (light) and the valve structure is required. Through variation of {{the composition of the}} ionogels, each of the micro-valves can be tuned to open at different times under similar illumination conditions. Therefore, flows through the manifold can be independently controlled by a single light source. At present, the contraction process to open the channel is relatively rapid (seconds) while the recovery (expansion) process to re-close the channel is relatively slow (minutes), meaning that the valve, in its current form, is better suited for single-actuation events...|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{advances}} in micro-fluidic techniques for environmental applications have brought wide opportunities for improving of {{the capacity to}} monitor water quality. However, the development of fully integrated micro-fluidic devices capable of performing complex functions requires the integration of mico-valve with appropriate performance, since they are essential tools for the control and manipulation of flows in micro-channels. [1] The incorporation of ionic liquids within responsive gel matrices (ionogels) produces hybrid materials with many advantages over conventional materials. Depending on the ionic liquid, ionogels give the possibility of tuning several micro-valve actuation times and so independently control liquid flows within the channels under a common illumination source. [2] The undeniable advantage of these materials arise {{from the use of}} non invasive, non-contact stimuli such as light, offering improvements in versatility during manifold fabrication, and control of the actuation mechanism.

As the energy costs rise, increasing effort has gone into minimizing the energy consumption of lighting installations.

By controlling the lighting {{in such a way that}} the lighting level is always accurately matched to the actual need allows to save on the energy costs and to improve the human comfort and efficiency.

40|$|Increased {{demand for}} {{improved}} water management with greatly improved price/performance characteristics is a driving need for water quality monitoring systems. Typical analysis methods are very costly and time consuming, therefore simple, rapid, accurate, cost-effective field-deployable sensors incorporating wireless communication capabilities {{need to be}} developed. The main requirements of these sensors such as reproducibility, low cost as well as selectivity and sensitivity must be met for scale-up and mass fabrication allowing for real-time monitoring as well as widespread field deployment. The first use of a wireless paired emitter detector diode (PEDD) as an optical sensor for water quality monitoring in a lab-on-a-disc device will be presented (Figure 1 a). The microfluidic platform {{is based on a}} pH dye/ionogel sensing area (Figure 1 b), combined with a low-cost, wireless optical sensor, PEDD, for monitoring the pH and the degree of turbidity of water samples in real time. So far, environmental water quality analysis has been provided by standard lab-on-a-chip systems, but not by centrifugal disc (CDs) platforms, which offer many advantages. Sensors development is highly related to the generation and control of liquid flow within the micro-channels. Adaptive multifunctional materials are materials whose characteristics can be altered using an external stimulus without physical contact and therefore, can be used for fluid control. Photoswitchable materials posses the obvious advantage that arises from the use of non-contact, non invasive stimuli, such as light.

40|$|Metal organic {{frameworks}} (MOFs) {{have emerged}} as ideal adsorbents for carbon capture owing to their exceptionally high surface areas and chemical versatility. However, the significant energy penalty for the regeneration of MOF adsorbents {{is one of the}} biggest barriers to their widespread deployment. To overcome this challenge, there has been a recent surge of high quality research to adapt MOFs to be responsive to external stimuli including light and magnetic fields such that they might expel adsorbed molecules at low energy cost and high efficiency. To further minimize the energy cost required for the regeneration of MOF adsorbents, we present a robust dual stimuli-responsive MOF, magnetic PCN- 250 (mPCN), which shows strong responses to both magnetic induction and UV light following two distinct working mechanisms, magnetic induced <b>localised</b> heat and <b>light</b> induced <b>localised</b> bending of the MOF organic linkers. Both responses are able to collaboratively trigger a record high gas desorption (up to 96. 8 % of CO 2 desorption at 1 bar) from mPCN through a MaLISA process, confirming a potentially low-energy yet highly efficient strategy to regenerate MOF adsorbents on a large scale.

At the same time, anti-MBP SLE IgGs efficiently hydrolyze oligopeptides corresponding to AGDs of MBP. All sites of IgG-mediated proteolysis of 21 -and 25 -mer encephalytogenic oligopeptides corresponding to two known AGDs of MBP were found by a combination of reverse-phase chromatography, TLC, and MALDI spectrometry. Several clustered major, moderate, and minor sites of cleavage were revealed in the case of 21 - and 25 -mer oligopeptides.

40|$|The {{field of}} {{lighting}} design {{is a highly}} specialised one. The control and manipulation of both natural and artificial light is a difficult aspect of building design. Proficient architects, interior designers and engineers must currently draw on their own experience and resources to evaluate their lighting designs. However, most often lighting design is overlooked and not fully understood by building designers. Those lighting designers that do have {{a good understanding of}} lighting are hampered by current conventional design methods when dealing with alternative and creative lighting designs. This is especially the case when dealing with natural daylight which tends to be under utilised, particularly in climatic areas that differ greatly from the European standard daylight design skies. There is clearly a need for a tool that enables building designers to quickly and accurately evaluate their use of <b>localised</b> natural <b>light</b> and specific artificial light in their building designs. The recent development of accurate, physically based computer models and the resulting photo realistic computer rendered images, can provide the basis of a platform for lighting designers to visualise their lighting designs. Such lighting platform enables designers to make more informed design decisions when looking at new approaches and unusual situations. The aim of this thesis is to explore and formulate a working example of such a lighting design platform, where by designers can easily evaluate lighting and daylighting designs based upon real world <b>lighting</b> and <b>localised</b> atmospheric conditions. The designer is presented with an easy to use graphical user interface, that is able to produce a photometrically accurate photo realistic computer image. This platform was achieved through the development of three key areas. The first was the creation of a process of integrating a specific physical based rendering program, RADIANCE (Ward 1996) into an existing three dimensional computer aided design modelling package. The second area consisted of creating a localised daylight model suitable to improve the accuracy of the physical based renderer when dealing with specific local atmospheric conditions. This daylight model was based on Kittlers' sky irradiance model (Kittler 1982 a). The final area was the development of a graphical user interface that provides an easy to use, front end to the lighting design platform. The results of this thesis exist in a working suite of programs and graphical user interfaces where local daylight and atmospheric condition can be specified and a photo realistic image of a design produced. The success of this platform can be demonstrated by the quality of the images that are produced. A designer can begin to use the interface with ease after very little instruction and thus start to quickly evaluate their design in terms of lighting manipulation and control. This ability to visualise and assess lighting and its effects, both natural daylight and artificial, will inevitably lead to a higher quality of successful building designs...|$|R

Sponsorship: France-New Zealand Cultural Agreement and by INRA (Direction des Relations Internationales) /British CouncilPlants sense {{the presence of}} neighbouring vegetation through phytochrome photoreceptors perceiving a lowered red to far-red ratio (R:FR) of light reflected from such vegetation. We hypothesised {{that it would be}} advantageous for the grassland clonal herb, Trifolium repens, to have an inhibitory branching response to perception by leaves of light reflected from neighbouring vegetation (i. e. light with lowered R:FR ratio) but have no response to interception of such light by the plagiotropic stem. We tested whether photoreception of reflected light by plagiotropic stems resulted in a different branching response to photoreception by leaves and whether leaf ontogeny influenced the response. To simulate light reflected from vegetation, FR light-emitting-diodes were used to supplement controlled environment room light so that the R:FR ratio, but not the photosynthetic photon fluence rate, of light incident at the stem or leaf of a phytomer of T. repens was lowered from 1. 20 to 0. 25. The plagiotropic stems were unresponsive to light simulating that reflected from vegetation. This response differs from that of stems of orthotropic species, indicating that plagiotropic stems have evolved an organ-specific photobiology. Treatment of the mature leaf with light of lowered FR ratio reduced phytomer production only of the branch in the axil of the treated leaf. Similar treatment of the immature leaf retarded, in addition, branching at basal phytomers {{on the same side of}} the primary stem axis. Thus the response to light simulating that reflected from neighbouring vegetation depended upon whether the light was incident at the stem or the leaf and on the stage of leaf development. We argue that such responses improve the performance and fitness of T. repens within grassland habitats by allowing axillary buds on plagiotropic stems to branch freely when stems are in receipt of light reflected from vegetation while leaves are in full light.

40|$|Environmental {{monitoring}} {{has grown}} substantially {{in recent years}} in response to increasing concerns over the contamination of natural, industrial, and urban areas with potentially harmful chemical agents. Traditional monitoring of water contamination is based upon manual in-situ ‘grab’ sampling followed by laboratory testing. Advantages of this strategy include high precision and accuracy of the measurements, however because of the expense involved in maintaining these facilities there are inherent restrictions in terms of spatial and temporal sampling. In contrast, in-situ measurements generated with portable instruments present a much more scalable model, enabling denser monitoring. The challenge is to develop inexpensive and reliable devices that can be used in-situ, with the capability to make the resulting data available remotely via web-databases, so that water quality can be monitored independently of location. Miniaturisation of analytical devices through the advent of microfluidics has brought wide opportunities for water analysis applications. The vision is to miniaturise processes typically performed in a central clinical lab into small, simple to use devices – so called lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems. Microfludic systems are especially promising for point-of-care applications due to the low cost, low reagent consumption and portability, and the focus of this thesis is to provide novel microfluidic platforms towards an integrated system for water quality analysis. A main outcome of my work was the development and validation of innovative integrated systems that were designed and developed for quantitative analysis of turbidity and qualitative analysis of pH and nitrites in water samples. The microfluidic manifolds were designed and fabricated using rapid prototyping techniques such as soft lithography and CO 2 laser cutting. For fluid propulsion, various methods were employed: back pressure, capillary forces (typical microfluidic manifolds) and centrifugal force (centrifugal discs). In the latter, fluid propulsion was performed by the forces induced due to the rotation of the disc, thus eliminating the need for external pumps since only a spindle motor is necessary to rotate the disc. Centrifugal discs systems are especially promising for point-of-care applications, and as a final output the fully integrated portable wireless system for in-situ colorimetric analysis was demonstrated. In all systems a low cost but highly sensitive paired emitter- detector diode (PEDD) method was employed to perform colorimetric measurements. Moreover, due to the wireless communication, acquisition parameters were controlled remotely and the results were downloaded from distant locations and displayed in real time. The autonomous capabilities of the system, combined with the portability and wireless communication, provide the basis for a flexible new approach for on-site water monitoring. In addition, their small size and low weight offered the advantage of portability. The suitability of the low-power analysers for the precise and continuous measurement of samples was established, since the analysers exhibited low limits of detection. Freshwater samples were analysed and the results were compared to those generated with a conventional bench-top instruments showing good agreement. Additionally, stimuli-responsive materials based on N- isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) phosphonium ionogels were characterised and incorporated within microfluidic platforms as sensors and actuators. The phase change NIPAAm ionogel functionalised with spirobenzopyran chromophores was characterised and applied for fluid control within microfluidic manifold. Microvalve actuation was performed by the <b>localised</b> white <b>light</b> irradiation, thus allowing for non-contact manipulation of the liquids inside of the microchannels.

40|$|When {{a defect}} is {{introduced}} into a lattice it modifies the lattice vibrations in two ways. First {{there is a}} modification of the amplitude of the vibrations {{as a function of}} frequency. This is greatest in the immediate vicinity of the defect and negligible at large distances from it. The second is that new frequencies of vibration may appear. These are the localised modes. If the impurity has a much lighter mass than any of the constituent atoms of the lattice the frequency of this vibration is considerably higher than any of the lattice frequencies and the amplitude of the mode falls off rapidly away from the defect. The resultant mode is well localised and is almost solely confined to the defect atom itself. Localised modes of this type are a subject of investigation in this thesis. The particular system studied was that of substitutional hydride and deuteride ions in the alkaline earth fluorides. The localised vibrations of these defects were detected as absorption lines in the infrared spectra of these crystals. The fundamental, second harmonic and a third harmonic doublet were measured for both the hydrogen and deuterium impurities. The lines display a marked temperature dependence and this was measured in the temperature range 4 Â°K to 300 Â°K. Mr. C. T. Sennett of this laboratory has developed a theory appropriate for <b>localised</b> vibrations of <b>light</b> impurity atoms in lattices and this was used to interpret the observations. The existence of harmonic lines indicated that the light atom is present as a negative ion at a tetrahedral fluorine site. The deviation of the harmonic lines from exact harmonicity and the temperature shift of the peak position and width are attributed to anharmonic effects. The experimental data was sufficient to determine the magnitude of these anharmonic forces to terms quartic in the light ions displacement. Satellite lines are present around the main vibration lines and these are ascribed to perturbations of the light impurity ion by nearby lattice defects and, {{in the case of the}} more distant lines, to light impurity ions present in lattice sites of different symmetry. The light impurity ion thus can be used as a probe to investigate other defects in the fluorite lattice. Broad sidebands occur equally spaced in frequency about the main line. These bands are interpreted as multiphonon combination bands arising from the simultaneous excitation or decay of lattice phonons with excitation of the local mode phonon. The frequencies of these bands were used to determine the frequencies of peaks in the density of states of various branches of the dispersion curves of the three alkaline earth fluorides. These impurity induced lattice bands are experimentally more accessible than the pure lattice combination bands and thus offer a simpler method of determining dispersion data for these crystals. Nickel and cobalt ions can be introduced into lithium fluoride crystals in sufficient concentration for their optical absorption to to be detectable. These ions substitute for the lithium and are thus octahedrally surrounded by six fluorine ligands. The measured spectra were interpreted on the basis of the crystal field theory of Tanabe and Sugano in the cubic field approximation. Spin-orbit coupling effects were included in the analysis. Room temperature X-irradiation of pure lithium fluoride crystals results in the formation of intrinsic lattice defects of which the F and M centres are the most well established. The F centre consists of an electron bound to a negative ion vacancy while the M centre is believed to be a pair of F centres. Interesting phenomena are observed after irradiation of lithium fluoride crystals containing nickel and cobalt. The nickel impurity strongly suppresses the formation of both the F and M centres while the cobalt impurity has little effect. The specific effect of the nickel impurity is related to the strong electron trapping properties of this ion. This interpretation is consistent with earlier electron spin resonance measurements on the irradiated crystals. While investigating the irradiation behaviour of pure and iron group impurity doped lithium and sodium fluoride crystals an absorption due to a V centre of the molecular F 2 − ion type was observed. This centre has been shown by Känzig (by electron spin resonance methods) to consist of an isolated hole located on two neighbouring fluorine ions. The optical absorption of this centre in the two lattices differ in some respects. The frequencies are similar (28700 cm − 1 for LiF and 27300 cm − 1 for NaF), but the disorientation temperatures (at which the centres are just mobile) differ, being 114 Â°K for LiF and 155 Â°K for NaF. Several transition metal compounds exhibit antiferromagnetic ordering phenomena at low temperatures. These affect the frequency of optical absorption lines slightly and the onset of the ordering may be studied t in suitable cases, by the temperature dependence of the frequency of sharp optical absorption lines. Experiments of this type performed on MnF 2, KMnF 3, and KNiF 3 revealed a marked frequency shift of sharp absorption lines in the spectra of these substances near the NÃ©el temperatures. The magnitude of such shifts is discussed. The optical absorption of trivalent rare earth ions are characterised by the presence of groups of sharp weak lines which arise from transitions within the 4 f n configuration. In a suitable host lattice the rare earth ions may be present in cubic symmetry sites and the structure of the line groups is then readily amenable to analysis. The optical absorption of holmium in calcium fluoride was investigated as a typical example of such systems. The line group positions were interpreted using the electrostatic and spin-orbit matrices for the f 10 configuration. The structure of the line groups indicated that the holmium ions were not in cubic symmetry sites, but were perturbed by the presence of adjacent charge compensating defects, and an analysis of this structure was not attempted. The occurrence of the holmium in noncubic sites is consistent with the electron spin resonance observations which show that only 2 % of trivalent holmium ions, namely those on cubic sites, undergo conversion into the divalent form. An experimental study of various ferrous iron compounds revealed a large (approximately 1500 cm − 1) splitting of the broad absorption band near 10000 cm − 1 in all the compounds. This band arises from the 5 T 2 (5 D) → 5 E(5 D) transition of the 3 d 6 configuration. This splitting cannot be due to spin-orbit coupling effects or, in the case of the cubic crystals, to low symmetry fields. It was attributed to a dynamic Jahn Teller distortion of the upper E g level. The magnitude of such splitting is discussed on this model. In analogy to the molecular F 2 − ion V centre of the alkali halides, a centre of similar type occurs in the alkaline earth fluorides. This was detected by J. W. Twidell of this laboratory using electron spin resonance methods. This centre possesses symmetry in contrast to the symmetry shown by the alkali halide centres and this is due to the different symmetries of the two lattices. An optical absorption band present at 28000 cm − 1 in irradiated crystals of calcium fluoride doped with thulium is tentatively assigned to these centres. </p...|$|R
