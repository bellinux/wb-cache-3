5|$|Baleen whales have a small, yet functional, vomeronasal organ. This allows baleen whales {{to detect}} {{chemicals}} and pheromones released by their prey. It {{is thought that}} 'tasting' the water is important for finding prey and tracking down other whales. They {{are believed to have}} an impaired sense of smell due to the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> olfactory bulb, but they do have an olfactory tract. Baleen whales have few if any taste buds, suggesting they have lost their sense of taste. They do retain salt-receptor taste-buds suggesting that they can taste saltiness.|$|E
5|$|Due to the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{intrinsic}} {{magnetic field}} on Venus, {{the solar wind}} penetrates relatively deep into the planetary exosphere and causes substantial atmosphere loss. The loss happens mainly via the magnetotail. Currently the main ion types being lost are O+, H+ and He+. The ratio of hydrogen to oxygen losses is around 2 (i.e. almost stoichiometric) indicating the ongoing loss of water.|$|E

30|$|Several studies {{indicate}} that <b>the</b> etiology <b>of</b> error in emergency ultrasonography is multi-factorial. Common sources of error in emergency ultrasonography are: <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> attention to <b>the</b> clinical history and examination, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> communication with <b>the</b> patient, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> technical equipment, use of inappropriate probes, inadequate optimization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> images, failure <b>of</b> perception, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possible differential diagnoses, over-estimation of one’s own skill, failure to suggest further ultrasound examinations or other imaging techniques.|$|R
30|$|Causes {{of error}} in {{emergency}} ultrasonography are multifactorial, frequently exist in combination {{as in other}} diagnostic imaging techniques [9, 10] and include: <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> attention to <b>the</b> clinical history and examination, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> communication with <b>the</b> patient (who may be uncooperative), <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> technical equipment, use of inappropriate probes, inadequate optimization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> images, failure <b>of</b> perception, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possible differential diagnoses, over-estimation of one’s own skill, failure to suggest further ultrasound examinations or other imaging techniques (such as CT or MRI) [11 – 16].|$|R

5|$|After Vali's death, Sugriva acquires Vali's kingdom {{as well as}} Tara. The Ramayana {{does not}} record any formal {{marriage}} or any ritual purification—like the trial by fire Sita had to undergo when she is reacquired by Rama from Ravana—that Tara must undertake to marry Sugriva or return to Vali following his return from the dead. The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> description of formal marriage suggests, according to some critics, that Tara's relationship to Sugriva is neither widow re-marriage nor polyandry, but simply appropriation by Sugriva. In the references of the coronation of Sugriva as king, Angada is also described as the heir-apparent crown prince, while Tara is mentioned as Sugriva's wife. The Adhyatma Ramayana declares that Sugriva acquires Tara.|$|E
5|$|After {{an episode}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy, 80% of people develop hypopituitarism and require some form of hormone replacement therapy. The most common problem is growth hormone deficiency, which is often left untreated but may cause decreased muscle mass and strength, obesity and fatigue. 60–80% require hydrocortisone replacement (either permanently or when unwell), 50–60% need thyroid hormone replacement, and 60–80% of men require testosterone supplements. Finally, 10–25% develop diabetes insipidus, the inability to retain fluid in the kidneys due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pituitary antidiuretic hormone. This may be treated with the drug desmopressin, which can be applied as a nose spray or taken by mouth.|$|E
5|$|Antoine's {{marriage}} to Marie of Lorraine was unhappy and yielded only two daughters. Monaco's constitution confined the throne {{to members of}} the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> (<b>the</b> politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Monégasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.|$|E

5|$|As a result, {{the text}} of Asser's Life is known from a {{multitude}} of different sources. Various transcripts {{had been made of}} the Cotton manuscript and a facsimile of the first page of the manuscript had been made and published, giving more direct evidence for the hand of the scribe. In addition to these transcripts, the extracts mentioned above made by other early writers have been used to help assemble and assess the text. Because of the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> manuscript itself and because Parker's annotations had been copied by some transcribers as if {{they were part of the}} text, scholarly editions have had a difficult burden. There have been multiple editions of The Life published, both in Latin and in translation. The 1904 critical edition by W. H. Stevenson, Asser's Life of King Alfred, together with the Annals of Saint Neots erroneously ascribed to Asser, still provides the standard text. An important recent translation, with thorough notes on the scholarly problems and issues, is Alfred the Great: Asser's Life of King Alfred and Other Contemporary Sources by Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge.|$|E
5|$|Characteristics {{typically}} {{used in the}} field to distinguish Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca from lookalike species include: the soft, dry consistency of its cap; the crowded, decurrent, and forked gills that are saffron to orange coloured; and the lack of any distinctive taste or odour. The false chanterelle can be distinguished from the true chanterelle (Cantharellus cibarius) by its deeper orange colour, brown base to the stipe, velvety cap surface, forked gills rather than gill-like ridges, softer (and thinner) flesh, and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characteristic apricot-smell. The cap surface of Hygrophoropsis fuscosquamula, found in Britain, has fine brown scales overlaying a dull orange background. H.rufa has velvety brown fur covering its cap, while H.macrospora has cream gills and stipe. Microscopically, these three species have larger spores than H.aurantiaca. H.tapinia, found in a range extending from southern Florida to Central America, is set apart from H.aurantiaca by its growth on or under deciduous trees (never conifers), and smaller spores, which measure 3.3–4.8 by 2.5–3.3µm.|$|E
5|$|Dredd was {{released}} on 7 September 2012 in the United Kingdom and on 21 September worldwide. Critics were generally positive about the film's visual effects, casting and action, while criticism focused on excessive violence {{as well as a}} perceived <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> satirical elements that are found in the source comic. Despite the positive critical response, the film earned just over $41 million at the box office on an estimated budget of $30–45 million. Dredd saw greater success following its home release, and has since been recognised as a cult film. The theatrical gross made a sequel unlikely, but home media sales and fan efforts endorsed by 2000 ADs publisher Rebellion Developments have maintained the possibility of a second film.|$|E

5|$|In {{areas where}} there is little iodine in the diet, {{typically}} remote inland areas and semi-arid equatorial climates where no marine foods are eaten, iodine deficiency gives rise to hypothyroidism, symptoms of which are extreme fatigue, goitre, mental slowing, depression, weight gain, and low basal body temperatures. Iodine deficiency {{is the leading cause}} of preventable intellectual disability, a result that occurs primarily when babies or small children are rendered hypothyroidic by a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> element. The addition of iodine to table salt has largely eliminated this problem in the wealthier nations, but iodine deficiency remains a serious public health problem today in the developing world. Iodine deficiency is also a problem in certain areas of Europe. Information processing, fine motor skills, and visual problem solving are improved by iodine repletion in moderately iodine-deficient children.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Har Gobind Khorana and {{co-workers}} developed a phosphodiester method where 3’-O-acetylnucleoside-5’-O-phosphate 2 (Scheme 3) was activated with N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or 4-toluenesulfonyl chloride (Ts-Cl). The activated species were reacted with a 5’-O-protected nucleoside 1 {{to give a}} protected dinucleoside monophosphate 3. Upon the removal of 3’-O-acetyl group using base-catalyzed hydrolysis, further chain elongation was carried out. Following this methodology, sets of tri- and tetradeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized and were enzymatically converted to longer oligonucleotides, which allowed elucidation of the genetic code. The major limitation of the phosphodiester method consisted {{in the formation of}} pyrophosphate oligomers and oligonucleotides branched at the internucleosidic phosphate. The method seems to be a step back from the more selective chemistry described earlier; however, at that time, most phosphate-protecting groups available now had not yet been introduced. The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> convenient protection strategy necessitated taking a retreat to a slower and less selective chemistry to achieve the ultimate goal of the study.|$|E
5|$|Since LAGs can be obliterated by bone remodeling, this {{represents}} an underestimate {{of the true}} number of LAGs that had actually developed; McDonald and colleagues estimated three or four missing LAGs by examining the spacing between the visible LAGs. This indicates that the animal was eight to nine years old when it died. The spacing between the LAGs decreases significantly towards the outer surface, indicating that growth was slowing, but the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> external fundamental system (a series of tightly-spaced LAGs) indicates that growth had not yet ceased. This {{is consistent with the}} unfused sutures between the centra and neural spines in the cervical and dorsal vertebrae, and the unfused sutures between the sacral centra and their corresponding ribs. Overall, the growth rate of Eolambia appears to have been comparable to that of Hypacrosaurus and Maiasaura, which reached maturity after seven or eight years.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Tamatave (sometimes {{called the}} Battle of Madagascar or the Action of 20 May 1811) was fought off Tamatave in Madagascar between British and French frigate squadrons during the Napoleonic Wars. The action {{was the final}} {{engagement}} of the Mauritius campaign of 1809–1811, and it saw {{the destruction of the}} last French attempt to reinforce their garrison on Mauritius. Although the news had not reached Europe by February 1811 when the reinforcement squadron left Brest, Mauritius had been captured in December 1810 by a British invasion fleet, the French defences hampered by the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supplies and troops carried aboard the frigate squadron under the command of Commodore François Roquebert in Renommée. Roquebert's heavily laden ships reached Mauritius on 6 May and discovered that the island was in British hands the following day, narrowly escaping a trap laid by a squadron of British frigates ordered to hunt and destroy them.|$|E
5|$|The PS4 {{version of}} Leifthrasir {{received}} an aggregate score of 87/100 based on 49 reviews, becoming the 15th best-reviewed title of 2016.

Critics generally agreed that Leifthrasir was an improvement on the original game, praising its technical performance, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original's framerate problems, graphical upgrade, and redesigned gameplay systems. Despite this, reviewers noted that the game could get repetitive, with a few noting incumbent issues with its story presentation.|$|E
5|$|The Westland Apache {{experienced}} {{delays in}} entering service due to complications with the modifications made for British service. Prior to the Apache entering service in 2004, several development problems were noted, including a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ability to securely communicate with other helicopters and {{a risk of}} damage to the tail rotor and airframe from firing its Hellfire missiles. The problem with using the Hellfire was debris generated by the firing of missiles, both the Hellfire and CRV7 rockets, could strike {{the body of the}} aircraft and cause damage; resolving this issue created a delay to training programmes. These problems were corrected prior to entering service, a secure communications suite was installed and Hellfire missiles are routinely fired by Apaches. In 2002, government sources stated that full operational capability was set to be achieved by 2010.|$|E

They only introduced one new gameplay mechanic in the game; Takumi wanted to keep the game focused on the core concept of finding lies, and to keep it simple enough for his mother to play. The game was positively received by critics, who generally liked the writing, but criticized the game's short length and the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nintendo DS-exclusive gameplay mechanics that appeared in the previous game.|$|E
5|$|Verdi was {{concerned}} about {{working on a new}} opera at his advanced age, but he yearned to write a comic work and was pleased with Boito's draft libretto. It took the collaborators three years from mid-1889 to complete. Although the prospect of a new opera from Verdi aroused immense interest in Italy and around the world, Falstaff did not prove to be as popular as earlier works in the composer's canon. After the initial performances in Italy, other European countries and the US, the work was neglected until the conductor Arturo Toscanini insisted on its revival at La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera in New York from the late 1890s into the next century. Some felt that the piece suffered from a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> full-blooded melodies of the best of Verdi's previous operas, a view strongly contradicted by Toscanini. Conductors of the generation after Toscanini to champion the work included Herbert von Karajan, Georg Solti and Leonard Bernstein. The work is now part of the regular operatic repertory.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of February 1426 a special ceremony was dedicated to Jelena and Sandalj in Dubrovnik when they attended the feast of Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), the city's patron saint. Jelena intended {{to be buried in}} the church she would build in Dubrovnik. Initially, Dubrovnik was interested in accepting her wish on the condition that she help them take control of Novi, its rival in salt-trading. That is why Dubrovnik proposed to Sandalj to build an Orthodox church and home for old and sick people in 1434. Sandalj died in 1435 before he replied to their proposal. He was succeeded by his nephew Stjepan Vukčić Kosača who was a son of Sandalj's brother Vukac. After Sandalj's death Jelena did not interfere in the governing of the realm previously controlled by her husband but went to live at the seaside, probably in Novi. In September 1435 Jelena asked the Ragusans to allow her to build a church in Dubrovnik in which would be her grave. Since circumstances had changed after Sandalj's death, the Ragusans rejected Jelena's request although it was supported by her nephew, Serbian Despot Đurađ Branković. They justified their refusal with the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> approval of the Pope.|$|E
