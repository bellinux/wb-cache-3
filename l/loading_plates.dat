The models include thick steel <b>loading</b> <b>plates,</b> and cylinders with height-to-diameter ratios (h/d) ranging from 1 – 3 are treated. A simple constitutive model of the concrete is employed, which accounts for the strain hardening and softening in the pre- and postfailure regions, respectively.

For shorter cylinders the strain softening is more pronounced along {{the surface of the}} cylinder middle, whereas longer cylinders exhibit a more uniform distribution of strain softening. The failure modes for force and displacement controlled tests are found to be similar.

Because the initial gap distance h 0 is the same as the non-bonded cutoff radius between the rigid plate atoms and the CG beads (Table  1), any displacement of the plate toward the particle results in an axial loading via the repulsive energy potential; thus, there is no loading slack in the system when ϵ[*]=[*] 0.

40|$|Concrete in {{structures}} {{cannot be}} reliably simulated by computer under nonlinear triaxial stress state {{due to the}} lack of an appropriate constitutive relationship of concrete. When a continuum mechanics based constitutive model is adopted, users need to "adjust" its parameters to suit benchmark experimental results.

Most existing triaxial tests of concrete are for active stress condition. This type of test is not suitable for passively confined concrete, such as fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) confined concrete.

40|$|Abstract. Active {{acoustic}} monitoring {{can capture}} {{two types of}} fracture behavior in rock samples, opening and closure of an existing fracture and tip movement of a propagating fracture. The first type is related to wave transmission across the fracture interface. The second one {{is related to the}} travel times of waves that diffract at the fracture tip. A series of experiment has been conducted with an acoustic system that has transducers mounted on the loading frames of a tri-axial cell situated in the Rock Mechanics Laboratory, TUDelft, the Netherlands. The existing fractures are formed by cleaving the rock samples into layers and putting them back together. The propagating fractures were created by hydraulic fracturing via bore-hole injection. The tests in this study featured both cleaved and hydraulic fractures, and aimed to characterize the interaction between them. This paper focus on the data processing that is adapted to these special tests and comparison between the monitored and recovered fractures.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Wedge Splitting Test (WST) is to {{generate}} stable mode I fracture crack along a pre-established path, {{and be able to}} measure the specific fracture energy parameter of the material GFI. The test is performed on standard cylindrical notched specimens. In order to make decision on the optimal notch geometry for a specific rock test, a number of WST experiments were simulated numerically via FEM. Continuum elements with isotropic elastic behavior were used to represent the rock, the steel <b>loading</b> <b>plates</b> and an “equivalent spring” to the testing machine compliance. The notch and the fracture path on the rock were represented via zero-thickness interface elements. The notch elements were assumed linear elastic with very low elastic stiffness parameters Kn and Kt, so that they do not oppose any significant resistance to opening. The constitutive model used for the interface elements along the fracture path was the elastoplastic constitutive formulation with fracture energy-based evolution laws. The model results match very realistically the curves obtained in the experimental WST, allowing us to estimate indirectly, not only the specific fracture energy but also other basic mechanical parameters of the rock, such as the elastic modulus and the tensile strength...|$|E
40|$|Background Finite element {{models of}} {{augmented}} vertebral bodies require a realistic modelling of the cement infiltrated region. Most methods published so far used idealized cement shapes or oversimplified material {{models for the}} augmented region. In this study, an improved, anatomy-specific, homogenized finite element method was developed and validated to predict the apparent {{as well as the}} local mechanical behavior of augmented vertebral bodies. Methods Forty-nine human vertebral body sections were prepared by removing the cortical endplates and scanned with high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT before and after injection of a standard and a low-modulus bone cement. Forty-one specimens were tested in compression to measure stiffness, strength and contact pressure distributions between specimens and loading-plates. From the remaining eight, fourteen cylindrical specimens were extracted from the augmented region and tested in compression to obtain material properties. Anatomy-specific finite element models were generated from the CT data. The models featured element-specific, density-fabric-based material properties, damage accumulation, real cement distributions and experimentally determined material properties for the augmented region. Apparent stiffness and strength as well as contact pressure distributions at the <b>loading</b> <b>plates</b> were compared between simulations and experiments. Findings The finite element models were able to predict apparent stiffness (R 2 > 0. 86) and apparent strength (R 2 > 0. 92) very well.

40|$|During last decades, most R&D {{and field}} {{application}} {{projects have been}} concentrated on concrete columns repair and reinforcement using composite materials. Composites as external reinforcement result in considerable enhancement in strength and ductility of concrete when loaded axially. The use of composite materials could upgrade civil engineering structures and {{be the most effective}} way to introduce composites into widespread civil engineering use. The purpose of this experimental study is to make an investigation on the compressive behavior of concrete strengthened by CFRP of various qualities for the comparison of confinement effectiveness. The investigation included concrete cylinders with diameter 150 mm and height 300 mm subjected to compressive load. Five different concrete series with cube strengths 34. 2; 60. 5; 76. 2; 81. 4 and 104. 1 MPa, that cover nearly the whole range in practice, were investigated. The parameters taken under consideration for the confinement were the number of layers (CFRP reinforcement ratio ranging from 0. 31 % to 0. 94 %) for wrapping with carbon sheet with tensile strength 4500 MPa and modulus 234 GPa. The friction between steel <b>loading</b> <b>plates</b> and concrete surface was reduced by three layers of teflon sheet. The specimens were fully instrumented and apart from load, axial and lateral strains were measured, with LVDTs and strain gauges. The enhancement in strength and ductility of confined concrete was remarkable. The confined concrete displayed a distinct bilinear stress-strain response with transition zone around the ultimate strength of unconfined concrete. Maximum strength increase by the confinement was measured to be over 300 % for specimen of 34. 2 MPa concrete. It is evident that as the CFRP layer number increases, the strength and ductility in the axial direction are both improved. The slope of the branches after transition zone and confining pressure are depended on the volumetric ratio of the confining device. For higher concrete strength, the ultimate strength increase due to confinement was lower, which indicates that the confining pressure exerted by the composite material on the concrete surface, as a restriction of the lateral expansion of concrete, was not so effective for the high strength concrete, showing more brittle behavior. Cyclic load caused no degradation in confining action. On the contrary sometimes caused improvement, which could be due to the fact that the confinement imposed lateral strain by its interaction with the concrete during unload stage too. So in the next loading cycle the internal concrete cracks were uniformly developed in concrete mass and the load distribution was better. Stress-strain relationships of the monotonic load act like an envelope of that of cyclic load since they have similar loading paths. The confined concrete cylinders failed by fracture of the FRP confinement having lower lateral strain than the uniaxial ultimate tensile strain given by producer. CFRP ring test (ASTM standard D 2290) reveal the real ultimate tensile strain of confinement, which only slightly exceeds the ultimate lateral strain. For the satisfactory prediction of strength, the stress analysis of crack growth inside concrete after transition zone should be accompanied by the analysis of confinement and its interaction with the damaged concrete...|$|E
