40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceGlobal warming {{has forced}} the power {{industry}} to adapt its infrastructure and develop technology in order to mitigate the effects and reduce {{the extent to which}} it will affect the operation of the electrical grid. With this goal in mind, the project attempts to quantify the effect of global warming on transmission <b>line</b> <b>sag.</b> First, a climate model that could predict temperature data for the time period (2001 - 2100) was needed. Next, a relationship between temperature and electricity demand needed to be quantified. Using this relationship and the temperature values generated by the climate model, the predicted electricity demand values were calculated for the examined time period. Since the voltage at which power is transported remains constant, the rate at which power is delivered will be given by the current flowing through the conductor. Using the estimated current values, the temperature of the conductor was calculated. This value is then used to calculate incremental sag due to the additional electrical demand. The calculated incremental sag is then plotted across time to show the increase in sag as temperatures increase. The plots also show various spikes in transmission <b>line</b> <b>sag</b> values ranging from less than an inch to just over two inches over the examined time period which does not significantly affect the operation of the grid. However, the project was performed using ideal values and is only a best case scenario. Overall, the project was successful in establishing that a relationship between global warming and transmission sag does exist, and that it needs to be addressed during future infrastructure planning...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State UniversityThe {{emergence}} of smart grid technology requires {{changes in the}} infrastructure of the electric power system. One of these changes is the addition of sensors to the transmission portion of the power system {{in order to determine}} useful information about the system such as <b>line</b> <b>sag</b> and direction of power flow. Unfortunately, {{there are a number of}} inhibitors to incorporating these additional sensors. These include issues of initial cost and/or maintenance. Therefore, what is needed (especially in sparsely inhabited areas) is new sensors that are inexpensive to manufacture, do not compromise safety, can be installed without taking transmission lines out of service and require low levels of maintenance. The focus of this dissertation is on electromagnetic (EM) field sensors, a novel type of sensor that can be used for monitoring the state of power lines. These sensors do not require contact with the power lines; rather they utilize electric and magnetic field coupling. Important states (such as voltage, current and phase sequence) and geometric parameters (e. g., <b>line</b> <b>sag)</b> of the power lines can be monitored based on inherent correlations between those variables and the electromagnetic fields produced by the power lines. While similar sensors have been available for many years, the unique feature of the sensors discussed here is that they utilize the relative phase of the EM fields in the vicinity of the line to provide significantly better sensitivity than has been previously available. In addition, they are inexpensive, easy to install with live working techniques and require only a low level of maintenance. Three types of sensors, point probes, and perpendicular and parallel distributed sensors will be studied using basic reciprocity theory and developed to the point of application. Several field experiments were conducted for validation. Finally, potential applications of the sensors for monitoring power lines are explored.

The top surface between the two cliffs (tars) is covered by alluvial fan sediments, laid down by Al-Khir Valley when merging in a large depression due to the drop in the gradient of the valley. Consequently, the depression was divided into two parts, to the left is called Al-Razzazah Depression, whereas to the right is called Bahir Al-Najaf. This affected {{the course of the}} River Euphrates. The deposition stopped due to an uplift movement which caused the elevation of the two cliffs which are covered by alluvial fansediments. The two cliffs had and are still suffering from retreating, due to lateral erosion by wave actions in Al-RazzazahDepression.

Typical damage scenarios cover cracking of foundation, breakage of insulators, loosening of rivets, as well as cracking and breakage of lines. Such scenarios may result from various factors: groundings, lightning strikes, floods, earthquakes, aeolian vibrations, conductors galloping, icing, and also include sabotage or terrorist attacks. It is impossible to monitor every kilometer of power lines, especially when they pass through inaccessible areas like mountains or swamps. This implies {{that many of the}} damage scenarios mentioned remain unnoticed or are detected too late. In most cases damage of the power system leads to instantaneous blackouts of small regions, but huge blackouts are also possible. Every power outage causes a great financial loss, threats to hospital patients, public transport or even national security.

40|$|As {{the demand}} for energy increases, as well as {{the demand for}} {{renewable}} energy, Vattenfall, as network owner, receives many requests to connect new wind power to the grid. The limiting factor for how much wind power that can be connected to the grid is in this case the maximum current capacity of the overhead lines that is based on a line temperature limit. The temperature limit is set to ensure a safety distance between the lines and the ground. This master thesis project is a part of a research project at Vattenfall Research and Development that is examining the possibilities of increasing the allowed current on overhead lines {{in order to be able}} to connect more wind power to the existing network. Measured data from two overhead lines in southern Sweden is analyzed and the internal relations between the measured parameters are examined. The measured parameters are overhead <b>line</b> <b>sag,</b> line temperature, ambient temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and line current. The results indicate that there is a big load margin that could be utilized to increase the maximum current as long as further work could show that low winds at line height correlates with low wind at nacelle height. The results show that the sag versus line temperature is approximately linear within the measured temperature range. This means that a real-time-monitoring system measuring the line temperature should give adequate knowledge of the line position to ensure the safety distance. A model for the line temperature as a function of insolation, current, ambient temperature and wind speed has been estimated for one of the lines. Simulations show that a sudden increase in current at a worst-case scenario would give the operators about ten minutes to react before the line reaches the temperature limit...|$|E
40|$|Transmission {{congestion}} is {{a growing}} concern that could limit integration on new renewable energy projects to the electricity grid. Because construction of new transmission lines is a long and expensive process, transmission service providers are investigating dynamic line rating (DLR) mehtods that could potentially increase capacity of existing transmission lines. DLR is a smart-grid technology that enables rating of power lines based on real-time conductor temperature that is dependent on local weather conditions. whereas conventional practice relies on a static rating, which is based on conservative local weather assumptions to limit transmission <b>line</b> <b>sag.</b> With todays improved wind and weather models, communication systems, and computing hardware, a computational approach to DLR is a possibility. Current thesis research investigates year-long wind patterns over a large test bed area in southern Idaho, in collaboration with Idaho National Laboratory and Idaho Power Company. To instil further confidence in the DLR approach, as proposed in IEEE Standard 738, the ordinary differential equation model that governs conductor temperature change in time, has been first validated by coupled computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and heat transfer analysis. Both steady-state and transient thermal rating assumptions have been evaluated using field measurements and high order numerical methods. Under low-wind conditions it is found that the steady-state thermal-rating assumption can cause unnecessary curtailments of power. To better model the variation of temperature along the path of a transmission line, a large-eddy simulation (LES) of winds over the moderately complex terrain of the test bed area has been performed using clusters of graphics processing units (GPU). LES results indicate that wind speed as well as direction relative to the transmission line is a critical factor in determining the conductor temperature, which implies that numerical wind models need to provide accurate estimates of wind speed and direction in regions of complex terrain...|$|E
50|$|The {{electrical}} resistance {{of a power}} line causes it to produce more heat as the current it carries increases. If this heat is not sufficiently dissipated, the metal conductor in the line may soften such that it sags under its own weight between supporting structures. If the <b>line</b> <b>sags</b> too low, a flash over to nearby objects (such as trees) may occur, causing a transient increase in current. Automatic protective relays detect the excessively high current and quickly disconnect the line, with the load previously carried by the line transferred to other lines. If the other lines {{do not have enough}} spare capacity to accommodate the extra current, their overload protection will react as well, causing a cascading failure.|$|R

Conductors are typically operated {{based on a}} conservative static rating that assumes worst case weather conditions to avoid <b>line</b> <b>sagging</b> to unsafe levels. Static ratings can cause unnecessary congestion on transmission lines. To address this potential issue, a simulation-based dynamic line rating approach is applied to an area with moderately complex terrain.

The wind solver adopts the large-eddy simulation technique and the immersed boundary method with fine spatial resolutions to improve the accuracy of wind field predictions. Statistical analysis of simulated winds compare favorably against wind data collected at multiple weather stations across the testbed area.

The millions of people affected by a blackout in the western US, Canada, and parts of Mexico in July 1996 had no idea the power outage was caused by overloaded transmission <b>lines</b> <b>sagging</b> low enough to touch trees. Millions of New Englanders affected by power outages during the 1997 [...] 98 winter probably weren't aware that accumulations of ice and snow on transmission lines had caused the lines to snap. Yet, these two examples illustrate the urgent need to begin upgrading this country's aging electrical-power distribution systems. A key step in this process lies in improving the weight and conductivity characteristics of utility transmission and distribution lines. Conventional conductors used for overhead transmission and distribution lines are comprised of aluminum strands of wire wrapped around a steel core. The aluminum serves as the electrical conductor, while the steel provides mechanical support. This hybrid design results in an excellent weight-to-conductivity ratio, but it also yields a heavier product, which requires stronger and more costly support structures and limits conductivity. W. Brandt Goldsworthy and Associates, Inc., of Torrance, California, is developing a new composite-reinforced aluminum conductor to replace aging steel-core lines. The new composite conductor is lighter, stronger, and carries a higher current capacity than traditional power lines. The technology has been designed primarily for domestic utility transmission and distribution systems. This application takes the highest priority as utility deregulation continues to increase the demand for direct-power access. Subsequent applications exist through opportunities in the industrial power, building wire, telecommunications and data transmission, and high-temperature superconductor markets.
