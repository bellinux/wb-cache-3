50|$|Incumbent IT {{management}} {{dealing with}} <b>legacy</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and data management challenges cannot easily provision data {{as a service}} either because they are unaware of its advantages, or cannot acquire the budget for its successful implementation.

These deficiencies lead the business to implement IT solutions that may be perceived to cost less to execute, albeit whilst introducing risks which a formal IT project could avoid.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} their market, the service providers are introducing new attractive services to the end-users, which require modifications to their current infrastructure (aka <b>legacy</b> <b>infrastructure)</b> into what is typically termed as a Next-Generation infrastructure. The process of converting or modifying the network elements, end-user services and business-processes of the service provider to achieve the competitive advantages offered by the newer technologies is known as Transformation. This transformation is enabled by Internet Protocol (IP)-based technology. The introduction of the new infrastructure, services and business-processes {{may or may not}} be accompanied by the dismantling of the legacy setup.|$|E
30|$|At the Device Layer, the Web gateway is {{the core}} that it will bridge {{different}} types of sensors, actuators, and other SDs into the Internet, and all the data and capabilities of the devices could be abstracted as Web resources and enabled as web service APIs. We assume that the devices are provided and shared by third-party vendors. It means that their products are <b>legacy</b> <b>infrastructures</b> with different proprietary specifications and they could not directly {{be connected to the}} Web; thus these devices should connect to the Web via Web gateway. The first layer integration focuses mainly on the boundary between physical and digital realm, and the OUTPUT of it is the fine-grained building block for Web application based on SD which could be called SDS. At this layer, the SDs will have a uniform Web interface that could diminish the underlying heterogeneity of devices.|$|R

Core network technologies have been re-defined under the label of Next Generation Networks (NGN) and the transition from existing <b>legacy</b> <b>infrastructures</b> towards an all-IP based NGN is ongoing. Following this paradigm shift within telecommunications, new approaches in services and service composition are currently explored for converging network domains to support legacy circuit-switched networks, NGNs, and integration with the World Wide Web (WWW). Furthermore, emerging initiatives as the Japanese Architecture Design Project for New Generation Network (AKARI), U. S. -based Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI), Germany Laboratories (G-Lab), and the European Future Internet Research & Experimentation (FIRE) envision a Future Internet allowing automatic cross-layer network adaptation on a service-specific basis.

50|$|In 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) {{contracted}} a CH2M Hill company, CH2M Hill Plateau Remediation Company, LLC (CHPRC), {{to manage}} deconstruction and remediation of the Central Plateau on the Hanford Nuclear Site in eastern Washington, {{one of the}} world’s largest environmental cleanup projects. The project focused on shrinking the environmental footprint of the Hanford Site from a 586 sq mi area (large enough to fit the city of Los Angeles) to 75 sq mi or less. More importantly, the project will reduce <b>legacy</b> <b>infrastructure</b> costs on site by more than $25 million per year starting in 2015. Using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding, CHPRC sped up cleanup of the site over two years, reducing the site footprint 25 percent, employing an additional 1,350 people in the process. When ARRA funded work concludes in September 2012, the site footprint was targeted to shrink {{to a total of}} 290 sq mi, roughly half its previous size. Without ARRA funding, however, the scope of DOE contracted work at Hanford will be reduced. The company also announced that its workforce would reduce by up to 1,350 workers later that year through a combination of voluntary and involuntary separations.|$|E
5000|$|MyRepublic was co-founded in 2011 by Malcolm Rodrigues, {{a former}} Vice President of StarHub International and Wholesale; KC Lai, a former StarHub Senior VP of Consumer Sales; and Greg Mittman, {{previously}} a lead of Alcatel-Lucent's National Broadband Network Team. The company launched with fibre internet plans offering speeds {{of up to}} 150 Mbps. [...] In 2012, the company had 32 full time staff in its employ, 450 resellers of their services, around 10,000 subscribers and more than SGD $5 million in revenue. Rodrigues attributed {{the growth of the}} company to its “thin operator model” which does not rely on costly <b>legacy</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> In February, the company launched GAMER packages, becoming the first Internet service provider in Singapore to offer fibre broadband plans specifically catered towards gamers. In 2013, MyRepublic launched Teleport, a VPN-like service, which allowed users to stream content from online services from around the world like Hulu, Pandora, Netflix and BBC iPlayer using non-traditional VPN methods. The company also opened its flagship store at Ang Mo Kio Hub. By then, MyRepublic held a 17 percent market share of the fibre broadband consumer market and established itself in a short time as a disruptive influence.|$|E
