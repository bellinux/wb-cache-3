5|$|Her primary outfit {{consists}} of a blue and white wrestling <b>leotard</b> with an eyemask and knee-length white boots. Her outfit slightly differed, depending on the game. In Alpha 3, her breasts were covered by two blue heart shaped patterns, but in SFV the blue hearts were replaced by a heart-shaped hole in the chest of her <b>leotard.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gaga did not preview {{the costumes}} {{for the tour}} until the opening night. There were seven outfits created for the show, all {{throughout}} the different segments. The first was a bejeweled <b>leotard</b> which had the Jeff Koons blue gazing ball attached in the middle; the ball was previously used in the album cover art for Artpop. Gaga accessorized the dress {{with a pair of}} feathered wings while wearing a blond bob wig reminiscent of her looks from The Fame era. A rave inspired outfit was worn for the last segment and consisted of colorful dreadlocks and legwarmers made of fur. She added a shirt consisting of straps and plastic sleeves with it. One of the complex outfits was made of latex and consisted of a polka dotted <b>leotard</b> and a number of tentacles attached to the dress as well as a headpiece with two tentacles from it.|$|E
5|$|Ivy's {{alternate}} character {{designs in}} the games are a contrast to her primary designs, with the secondary from Soulcalibur to Soulcalibur III consisting of countess attire of either blue or red pants, vest, and jacket, with white boots covering her feet and her hair combed back. In Soulcalibur II, a tertiary alternate design was added consisting of a red <b>leotard</b> and gloves with gold trimming, with red stockings on her legs; in addition, a fourth design resembling her appearance {{at the conclusion of}} Soulcalibur was considered, incorporating a cloak and the symbol of caduceus on the front of her <b>leotard</b> cupping her breasts, but was unused. In Soulcalibur III, a long, rose-themed dress with hat and veil was used as a tertiary alternate, one of several considered designs. For Soulcalibur IV, a similarly themed black dress was used as her sole alternate design for the game.|$|E
50|$|By {{the late}} 1970s <b>leotards</b> had become common both as {{exercise}} and street wear, popularized by the disco craze, and aerobics fashion craze of the time. These <b>leotards</b> were produced {{in a variety}} of nylon and spandex materials, as well as the more traditional cotton previously used for uni-colored <b>leotards</b> and tights. Exercise videos by celebrities such as Jane Fonda also did much to popularize the garment. The dancewear company Danskin flourished during this period, producing a wide variety of <b>leotards</b> for both dance and street wear. Other companies, such as Gilda Marx, produced <b>leotards</b> during this time period then ceased production when they were no longer in fashion. By the late 1980s <b>leotards</b> for exercise wear had become little more than bikini bottoms with straps over the shoulders, generally worn with cropped shirts. From the mid 80's through the mid 90's <b>leotards</b> were popularly worn as tops with jeans especially skinny jeans as part of everyday wear. By the mid 1990s <b>leotards</b> had been almost completely replaced for exercise wear by the sports bra and shorts.|$|R
50|$|The 1920s and 1930s saw <b>leotards</b> {{influencing}} {{the style of}} swimsuits, with women's one-piece swimsuits today still being similar in appearance to <b>leotards.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s, traditionally-styled <b>leotards</b> {{continued}} to be worn mainly by stage performers and circus actors, but <b>leotards</b> began {{to be used as}} simple and functional exercise garments, often in institutional settings like schools and in fitness training. These were almost always black and worn together with thick tights. Between 1950 and 1970, <b>leotards</b> remained as such in appearance until a style change in the 1970s, when more colorful <b>leotards</b> appeared on the scene, most often in ballet and exercise.|$|R
5|$|Another {{music video}} for the Maanstudio remix {{version of the}} song was shot by Ciprian Strugariu and {{uploaded}} onto MediaPro Music's YouTube channel on 9 December 2011. Andra Moga and Violeta Irimia were credited for styling and make-up, respectively. The visual starts with angle shots of the singer lying on sand, followed by her walking on a field wearing a black dress. Subsequently, the singer poses {{in front of a}} stonewall and performs to the song sporting a transparent jacket and a black <b>leotard.</b> The last scenes show her on a swing, swimming while a sea storm takes place, and her posing in front of a body of water with a black bodysuit on.|$|E
5|$|Liukin is {{fluent in}} English and Russian. She {{graduated}} from Spring Creek Academy, located in Plano, Texas, {{in the spring}} of 2007. She enrolled as a freshman international business major at Southern Methodist University in January 2008, and took a leave from classes to concentrate on preparations for the 2008 Olympic Games. She returned to campus in spring 2009, but her travel schedule and professional commitments caused her to withdraw {{before the end of the}} semester.

Subsequently, the singer appears in black hotpants and a blonde blouse {{in front of a}} neon-lightened X sign in the background, flirting with one male. For the first refrain, she and her background dancers perform hand choreography. Following this, Inna and others are seen on {{what appears to be a}} runaway, with rain coming out from above; similar neon signs are shown in the background. After Yandel's cameo appearance, the video ends with Inna and her dancers further performing to the track. Cut scenes show the singer dancing and performing a slut drop in front of a wet glass surface.|$|E
50|$|<b>Leotards</b> are {{commonly}} worn in figure skating, postwar modern dance, traditional ballet and gymnastics, especially by young children. Practice <b>leotards</b> are usually sleeveless. Female competition garments for gymnastics and skating {{are almost always}} long-sleeved, while male competition <b>leotards</b> may be sleeved or sleeveless, the latter more common in gymnastics, the former in figure skating.|$|R
50|$|Olympic {{gymnastics}} team <b>leotards</b> {{have dramatically}} changed {{from their first}} memorable designs. Over time, the emphasis on what <b>leotards</b> are intended to do has changed. Originally, the intent was to cover {{as much of a}} woman’s body as possible, while today, <b>leotards</b> must breathe, improve aerodynamics and seamlessly re-shape as female athletes bend, twist and contort their way through increasingly difficult routines.|$|R
50|$|In the video, {{the female}} {{soldiers}} are wearing white <b>leotards</b> {{in the style}} of soldiers, and the male soldiers wear the same, but without <b>leotards.</b> Goulding is wearing a checkered shirt and leggings.|$|R
5|$|As {{they move}} around {{the city in the}} van, they pick up {{different}} men from the streets to join them. These scenes are interspersed with the scenes of Madonna singing in front of the neon screen. The video progresses like this until the intermediate verse whence Madonna is shown standing in a cage opposite to a number of men. As the bridge builds up, Madonna starts fighting with the men. She starts bending backwards and tying herself in knot like positions, while doing backflips and somersaults which defeats the men. The chorus starts again and Madonna and her dancers are shown skating in circles around a roller rink. The video ends with the close-up of Madonna in the purple <b>leotard</b> and fades into her silhouette.|$|E
5|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} portrays Gaga as a doomed starlet, hounded by photographers, who is almost killed by her boyfriend. It shows her survival, comeback, revenge on her boyfriend, and experiences {{on the way}} to fame. The video won two MTV Video Music Awards in 2009 for Best Art Direction and Best Special Effects. Gaga also performed the song at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards in a performance art piece symbolizing the negative effect of fame leading to death. Additional live performances of the song include on The Fame Ball Tour, where it was the opening song, on an October 2009 episode of Saturday Night Live and on The Monster Ball Tour. On the first leg of the tour, she appeared as a Rapunzel-like character; from the second leg onward, she performed the song alongside a giant anglerfish ("The Fame Monster") who, attempting to devour her, was killed after her <b>leotard</b> shot sparks into the creature.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{is a tribute}} to John Travolta, his movies and to dancing in general. Directed by Johan Renck, the clip starts with Madonna clad in a pink <b>leotard</b> dancing alone in a ballet studio and concludes at a gaming parlor where she dances with her backup troupe. Interspersed are scenes of people {{displaying}} their dancing skills in a variety of settings, including a Los Angeles residential neighborhood, a small restaurant and the London Underground. It also features the physical discipline Parkour. Madonna has performed the song in a number of live appearances, including as the finale number in 2006's Confessions Tour, a heavy metal-inspired arrangement in the 2008 Sticky & Sweet Tour and during the 2012 MDNA Tour where the singer performed the song while slacklining.|$|E

5|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} by Gaga in a similar choreography at the thirty-fifth season of NBC's late night comedy show Saturday Night Live. It was also present on the set list of Gaga's The Monster Ball Tour. She wore multiple donned braided extensions and was perched atop a railing. From each of her braids, a dancer was attached on the stage. A backdrop of stars were shown during the performance. During the revised shows of The Monster Ball, Gaga changed the concept {{and the performance of}} the song. She wore an emerald green dress by Thierry Mugler, and was attacked by a giant, mechanical Angler fish. Gaga then removed the dress to reveal a <b>leotard</b> of the same color and during the bridge she is lowered beneath the stage to acquire her pyro-technic bra. In the final chorus of the song Gaga returns and kills the monster with the sparks from the bra.|$|E
5|$|The video commences with {{shots of}} a {{construction}} site, where Ciara arrives {{in a large}} construction vehicle. Elliott raps her opening verse {{from the top of}} a pile of large tires while Ciara makes her debut in a gray jumpsuit with square aviator sunglasses. She soon appears in a slender black <b>leotard</b> and walks seductively along a construction walkway. Ciara and her dancers move to a dune in front of the site, where they perform a group choreography. The dancers wear white tops, torn blue jeans, construction belts and goggles. The second verse features an intense dance and switches halfway through to Ciara in a turquoise PVC dress and black strap stilettos, dancing in front of a pile of tires. She and her dancers return to the dune and dance to Elliott's words. The video ends in the sand dune as Ciara and her dancers slowly drop to the ground and then get back up.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Knowles walking down an alley, {{accompanied}} by several men in suits, {{an homage to}} Quentin Tarantino's 1992 film Reservoir Dogs. As the main section of the song begins, cameras zoom in on Knowles as she dances in {{a black and white}} latex <b>leotard</b> while holding sunglasses with hand signals on them. When the first verse begins, Knowles seductively dances for two men who have cameras as heads. Another scene shows her teasing men with futuristic toy guns while wearing a skin-colored latex top. During Gaga's verse, she and Knowles appear wearing white leotards; they both sing to the camera while shooting more toy guns in open fire. Knowles next brandishes a bow and fires arrows at a cameraman who's strapped to a rotating dart board. She and Gaga, now in front of a white backdrop, perform a synchronized dance together, with Gaga wearing a pair of yellow Louboutins heels. Knowles then appears dressed as an homage to Bettie Page, while handling several different firearms. Throughout the video, the two singers fire their guns and arrows at men. The video ends with Knowles shooting a gun while perched upon a stationary motorcycle and surrounded by images {{from the start of the}} video.|$|E
50|$|<b>Leotards</b> are {{entered through}} the neck (in {{contrast}} to bodysuits which generally have snaps at the crotch, allowing the garment {{to be pulled}} on over the head). Scoop-necked <b>leotards</b> have wide neck openings and are {{held in place by}} the elasticity of the garment. Others are crew necked or polo necked and close {{at the back of the}} neck with a zipper or snaps.|$|R

5|$|The video {{starts with}} Madonna {{coming to a}} ballet studio {{carrying}} a boombox. She switches it on as the clock ticking sound of the music starts. Wearing a pink <b>leotard,</b> Madonna starts gyrating to the music while doing warm up exercises. The scene interchanges {{with a group of}} people on the street who start dancing to the music while listening to a similar boombox. They also display aspects of the physical discipline Parkour, while climbing over buildings and jumping from staircases. As the song starts, Madonna dances to the music in the ballet studio. The second verse shows her continuing dancing while the people from the street take their boombox and board a taxi. Scenes are interspersed with people dancing in a Chinese restaurant and Parisian streets. In the meantime, Madonna finishes her workout in the ballet studio, drops her towel, changes her clothes and comes out on the street. The people on the taxi, leave it and take the Underground instead. After another round of dancing in the train, the intermediate music starts.

25|$|In August 1945, {{following}} {{the liberation of}} France, La Rocque and his remaining followers, principally Pierre de <b>Léotard,</b> André Portier, and Jean de Mierry, established the Parti Républicain Social de la Réconciliation Française (Social Republican Party of French Reconciliation), known generally as Réconciliation Française and intended as the official successor of the PSF. On the initiative of <b>Léotard</b> the PRSRF participated in the right-wing Rally of the Republican Lefts (RGR, see sinistrisme) coalition in the elections of June 1946, November 1946, 1951, and 1956. The death of La Rocque in 1946 deprived the party of unifying leadership, however, and the pre-war popularity it had hoped to exploit never materialized. Though the PRSRF had effectively disappeared by 1956, with the schism that year of the RGR into center-left and center-right groups, some of its members would later continue their political careers within the conservative National Centre of Independents and Peasants (CNIP) party.|$|E

Most UDF members supported Edouard Balladur, whereas a minority endorsed Jacques Chirac, as Valéry Giscard d'Estaing had proposed. Supporters of Giscard formed the Popular Party for French Democracy (PPDF), that succeedeed to the Perspectives and Realities Clubs, while the CDS merged with the PSD into Democratic Force (FD). In 1996 a former balladurien, François <b>Léotard,</b> was elected President of the UDF by defeating Alain Madelin.|$|E
25|$|As {{a fitness}} instructor, Smith found {{a lack of}} {{appealing}} clothes in which to work and started to sew her own. She had no formal training in garment production, but had been interested in fashion since a teenager, crocheting bikinis from age 16, customising her clothes from age 18, and from age 21 starting to design and make her own clothes. She began by unpicking a favourite swimsuit {{and used it to}} make a pattern out of newspaper, providing the basis for her first <b>leotard</b> design. Her students liked her outfits, and started requesting that Smith make clothes for them too.|$|E
