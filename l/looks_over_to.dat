25|$|The West adopted {{many of the}} Byzantine {{iconographic}} elements, but {{preferred the}} stable rather than the cave, though Duccio's Byzantine-influenced Maestà version tries to have both. The midwives gradually dropped out from Western depictions, as Latin theologians disapproved of these legends; sometimes the bath remains, either being got ready or with Mary bathing Jesus. The midwives are still seen where Byzantine influence is strong, especially in Italy; as in Giotto, one may hand Jesus over to his mother. During the Gothic period, in the North earlier than in Italy, increasing closeness between mother and child develops, and Mary begins to hold her baby, or he <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> her.

25|$|Tina McIntyre {{embarked}} on an affair with Peter Barlow after they shared a passionate kiss during Peter and Carla Connor's wedding reception. Peter lies to Tina, telling {{her that he had}} leave Carla and move away with her to Portsmouth when he was actually committing to Carla after they discovered she was pregnant. The affair causes Peter to relapse and start drinking again. Carla's brother Rob Donovan discovers the affair and threatens them both that he will tell Carla if they do not. Tina books a taxi for her and Peter but cannot find Peter so she heads to the Rovers Return to find him and Carla celebrating Carla's pregnancy. Feeling crushed, Tina heads back to her flat and is pursued by Peter. They argue and Tina threatens Peter that she's going to reveal all about their affair to Carla, causing Peter to leave her flat and tell a heartbroken Carla about the affair before she does. Peter accidentally leaves Tina's flat door open whilst leaving and Rob notices and enters Tina's flat to confront her about her affair. Rob and Tina argue about her telling Carla about the affair, forcing them both onto her balcony outside. But when Tina threatens Rob about reporting his dodgy dealing at his pawn shop to the police, Rob pushes Tina from the balcony and she plummets to the ground. Rob frantically destroys Tina's flat in an attempt {{to make it look like}} a burglary and wipes his fingerprints off of everything he has touched. He heads outside to see a motionless Tina lying on the cobbles, he starts to call for an ambulance when Tina manages to get back to her feet. Rob tries backtracking his actions and tells Tina that she slipped but Tina goads Rob by saying she will report him for attempted murder as well as him selling illegal goods. Rob takes desperate measures to shut Tina up so he grabs a lead pipe from a van outside the builder's yard and bludgeons Tina to death. After Peter's confession, a furious Carla heads on the war path and goes in search of Tina. She notices Tina's door to her flat is open and heads inside to have it out with her. She enters the ransacked flat but does not find Tina anywhere, she heads out onto the balcony and <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> discover Tina's body on the floor below. Tina dies a week later from her injuries.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{discussed}} {{instance of}} a pillow shot in any Ozu film—indeed, {{the most famous}} crux in the director's work—is the scene that takes place at an inn in Kyoto, in which a vase figures prominently. During the father and daughter's last trip together, after a day sightseeing [...] with Professor Onodera {{and his wife and}} daughter, they decide to go to sleep, and lie down on their separate futons {{on the floor of the}} inn. Noriko talks about what a nice person Onodera's new wife is, and how embarrassed she feels for having called Onodera's remarriage [...] "filthy." [...] Shukichi assures her that she should not worry about it, because Onodera never took her words seriously. After Noriko confesses to her father that she found the thought of his own remarriage [...] "distasteful," [...] she <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> discover that he is already asleep, or seems to be. She looks up towards the ceiling and appears to smile.|$|E
60|$|This {{detail is}} what, with written help, I {{remember}} of the Generalife, but no loveliness of it shall fade from, my soul. From its embowered and many-fountained height it <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Alhambra, dull red, {{and the city}} wall climbing the opposite slope across the Darro to a church on the hilltop which was once a mosque. The precipice to which the garden clings plunges sheer to the river-bed with a downlook insurpassably thrilling; but the best {{view of the city}} is from the flowery walk that runs {{along the side of the}} Alcazaba, which was once a fortress and is now a garden, long forgetful of its office of defending the Alhambra palace. From this terrace Granada looks worthy of her place in history and romance. We visited the Alcazaba after the Generalife, and were very critical, but I must own the supremacy of this prospect. I should not mind owning its supremacy among all the prospects in the world.|$|E

50|$|As {{the medics}} begin {{wheeling}} George {{out of the}} asylum, he <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> see the corpse of Harry, with all his fingers intact, apparently having been killed {{at the very beginning}} of the riot. Apparently, George has hallucinated Harry's presence throughout the night. The film jumps ahead to focus on George in a bed while Lynn cries at his side. George has a vacant expression, having seemingly been driven mad by his experience. The camera zooms into George's mind where he is still working in the cafeteria with his bandmates, and the inmates are still on the loose.|$|E

As the gang leader <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> see an empty grave, Kinnear {{comes out of the}} shadows to attack the gang members. Kinnear is killed, as are the remaining gang members. Pepper saves Caviezel's life by shooting the gang leader, who has a gun leveled at Caviezel. The police arrive on the scene. Caviezel is praised for having survived so long undercover.|$|E

Frantically, Kaps puts some of the salt into his pants pocket {{to get rid of}} it. The march ends, but the salt keeps pouring. Kaps taps his foot for the bandleader to keep playing. It does and so does the salt. The music ends again and again the salt going. Kaps is {{laughing}} in embarrassment. He looks at the bandleader and utters “Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da,” and the band plays the Sousa march again.|$|E

On premiere night, the show is sold out and James is worried that no one will like it and stays out of the theatre while the movie plays. When James walks back into the room, he is met with a standing ovation. Happy that the film is a success, James <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the stage, he sees Brigsby waving goodbye and disappears.|$|E

The duo eventually find themselves back where they started, except the audience starts going back to people in white clothing and the curtains behind them are closed.|$|E

He tells her that he thinks they're ready to have their first child, but Jasmine tells him that it's impossible for her to have children. Sad over the realization, Shawn leaves to go think.|$|E
