50|$|The {{conductive}} AFM tip {{was easily}} aligned over the reflected illumination beam. The laser {{spot in the}} sample {{was reported to be}} 1mm in size and can be found using the AFM recording device. A convenience of this technique is that <b>laser</b> <b>alignment</b> is only necessary for imaging in the z-direction because the photocurrents are mapped in this direction. Therefore, normal AFM/c-AFM can be implemented for analysis in the x and y directions.The instrumental module proposed by Lee et al. produced spot sizes from the illumination laser of 1 mm in thicknesses. Recent applications have altered Lee’s design in order to decrease spot size while simultaneously increasing the intensity of this laser. Recent instrumentation has replaced the angled mirror with an inverted microscope and a neutral density filter. In this device the x and y piezos, illumination laser and inverted microscopy are confined underneath the sample substrate, while the z-piezo remains above the conductive cantilever. In the applications of Ginger et al. a neutral-density filter is added to increase laser attenuation and the precision of <b>laser</b> <b>alignment</b> is enhanced by the addition of the inverted microscope.|$|E

5000|$|The term fine {{adjustment}} screw typically refers to screws with threads from 40-100 TPI (Threads Per Inch) (0.5mm to 0.2mm pitch) and ultra {{fine adjustment}} screw {{has been used}} to refer to 100-508 TPI (0.2 mm to 0.05 mm pitch). Even though these are non-standard threads, both ISO metric screw thread designations and UNC designations have been used to call out thread dimensions and fit (class). A typical use for a fine adjustment screw is in an optical mirror mount as an adjuster. Typically 80 TPI screws are used in mirror mounts.

40|$|Visible {{spectroscopy}} is {{a powerful}} diagnostic, allowing plasma parameters ranging from temperature and density to electric and magnetic fields to be measured. Spectroscopic dopants are commonly introduced to make these measurements. On Z, dopants are introduced passively (i. e. a salt deposited on a current-carrying surface); however, in some cases, passive doping can limit the times and locations at which measurements can be made. Active doping utilizes an auxiliary energy source to disperse the dopant independently {{from the rest of}} the experiment. The objective of this LDRD project was to explore laser ablation as a method of actively introducing spectroscopic dopants. Ideally, the laser energy would be delivered to the dopant via fiber optic, which would eliminate the need for time-intensive <b>laser</b> <b>alignments</b> in the Z chamber. Experiments conducted in a light lab to assess the feasibility of fibercoupled and open-beam laser-ablated doping are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Wavefront sensors, {{based on}} the Shack-Hartman technology, {{have been widely used}} to perform highly {{accurate}} <b>laser</b> beam <b>alignment,</b> optical component characterization and optical system characterization. Wavefront sensors measure the amplitude and the phase of electromagnetic waves independently, giving intensity and wavefront profiles, respectively. The resulting absolute wavefront measurements are required in several applications, and absolute measurement accuracy {{is one of the key}} parameters for optical metrology.|$|R
50|$|The {{instrumentation}} of conductive AFM (c-AFM) {{has evolved}} {{with the desire}} to measure local electrical properties of materials with high resolutions. The essential components are: the piezo-tube, the guide laser, the conducting tip, and cantilever. Although these components are identical to traditional AFM their configuration is tailored to measuring surface currents on the local scale. As mentioned previously, the piezo-tube can be placed either above or below the sample, depending on the application of the instrumentation. In the case of c-AFM, repulsive contact mode is the predominantly used to obtain electric current images from the surface as the sample moves in the x and y direction. Placing the z-piezo above the cantilever allows for better control of the cantilever and tip during analysis.The material that comprises the conductive tip and cantilever can be customized for a particular application. Metal-coated cantilevers, gold wires, all-metal cantilevers and diamond cantilevers are used. In many cases diamond is the preferred material for cantilever and/or tip because it is an extremely hard material that does not oxidize in ambient conditions. The main difference between the instrumentation of c-AFM and STM is that in c-AFM the bias voltage can be directly applied to the nanostructure (tip and substrate). In STM, on the other hand, the applied voltage must be supported within the vacuum tunneling gap between the STM probe and surface. When the tip is in close contact with the sample surface the application of bias voltage to the tip creates a vacuum gap between the tip and the sample that enables the investigation of electron transport through nanostructures.The main components and instrumentation of c-AFM instrumentation are identical to that required for a pc-AFM module. The only modifications are the illumination source, filter and inverted microscope objective that are located beneath the sample substrate. In fact, most pc-AFM instruments are simply modified from existing cp-AFM instrumentation. The first report of this instrumental modification came in 2008. In that paper, Lee and coworkers implemented the aforementioned modifications to examine the resolution of photocurrent imaging. Their design consisted of three main units: a conductive mirror plate, steering mirror and laser source.The main difficulty with the previously existing c-AFM instrumentation is the inability of the technique for characterizing photonic devices. Specifically, it is difficult to measure changes in local and nano-scale electrical properties that result from the photonic effect. The optical illumination component (laser) was added to the c-AFM module in order to make such properties visible. Early in development, the main concerns regarding pc-AFM include: physical configuration, laser disturbance and <b>laser</b> <b>alignment.</b> Although many of these concerns have been resolved pc-AFM modules are still widely modified from c-AFM and traditional AFM instruments.|$|E

40|$|Fifteen out {{of forty}} phase-one beamline front ends have been {{installed}} in the storage-ring tunnel at the 7 -GeV Advanced Photon Source (APS). For the front-end installation, a four-step alignment process was designed and consists of (1) prealigning the front-end components with support tables in the preassembly area, (2) installing the components with tables in the storage-ring tunnel and aligning relative to the APS global telescope survey network, (3) confirming the alignment using a tooling <b>laser</b> <b>alignment</b> system, and (4) performing adjustments with the synchrotron-radiation beam during commissioning. The <b>laser</b> <b>alignment</b> system and the prealignment data- base have been of great importance for the expedient maintenance of front-end components.
