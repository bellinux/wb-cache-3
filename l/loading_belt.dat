50|$|For 2014, Leitner-Poma {{upgraded}} the Colorado SuperChair to a {{high speed}} six pack. It is the resort's fourth six pack, and increased the lift's uphill capacity from 2,800 people per hour to 3,600 people per hour, easing congestion on Peak 8, especially during the early season when it is the sole intermediate terrain lift open. The Colorado SuperChair is the first six pack on the mountain to use a conveyor <b>loading</b> <b>belt,</b> similar to {{a system that is}} widely utilized at many European ski resorts, which cuts down on stops and slows due to falls in the loading area. It is also the second lift on the mountain to have such a carpet belt, after Rip's Ride (also on Peak 8). In addition to the Colorado SuperChair, the Beaver Run SuperChair received new chairs taken from the original Colorado SuperChair. The Peak 9 Restaurant at the top of Lift C was renovated and turned into a new facility known as the Overlook Restaurant, after the original owners' lease expired {{at the end of the}} 2013-2014 season.|$|E
40|$|The {{indentation}} {{rolling resistance}} of conveyor belts {{is an important}} design consideration for long belt conveyors and can also be important for heavily <b>loaded</b> <b>belt</b> conveyors. Indentation rolling resistance {{is dependent on the}} properties of the conveyor belt, including the carcass and bottom cover as well as properties of the belt conveyor including induced <b>loads,</b> <b>belt</b> speed, ambient temperature and idler roll diameter. A purpose built laboratory test facility is described to measure the indentation rolling resistance of conveyor belts. The test facility is designed to accept both fabric and steel cord belts and test over a range of typical operating parameters and conditions. Results are presented for a range of test parameters, including; <b>load,</b> <b>belt</b> speed, idler roll diameter, ambient temperature and bottom cover compound. Application of the test data to conveyor design is also presented with the aim being to show how the test facility can be used to improve the accuracy of conveyor belt tension calculations by more accurately evaluating the performance of different rubber compounds and belt constructions...|$|R

50|$|Power {{transmission}} {{is a function}} of belt tension. However, also increasing with tension is stress (<b>load)</b> on the <b>belt</b> and bearings. The ideal belt is that of the lowest tension that does not slip in high <b>loads.</b> <b>Belt</b> tensions should also be adjusted to belt type, size, speed, and pulley diameters. Belt tension is determined by measuring the force to deflect the belt a given distance per inch of pulley. Timing belts need only adequate tension to keep the belt in contact with the pulley.|$|R

Since texture can only be defined over an area, Fourier domain methods are well suited for texture analysis, once it takes advantage of the fact that each frequency component contains information from all the pixels in that area. Although much work has been done withthisapproach,theuseofatexturegenerationmodelcanleadtoabetterinterpretationofthepower spectrum and the definition of the necessary measurements to distinguish image characteristics. This paper discusses texture analysis in the Fourier domain with the Spot Noise model as a guideline to interpret the power spectrum and shows the obtained results by the application of measurements that can characterize the spot underling the generation of a given random texture. The presented application is based on automatic analysis of cereal grains in a <b>loading</b> <b>belt.</b> 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to assess the applicability of the tactile pressure sensors for the measurement of the dynamic pressure on a <b>loaded</b> conveyor <b>belt.</b> Theoretical models have been developed to predict the dynamic pressure caused by the bulk material on the belt. However, there has been no satisfactory sensors or procedures for the direct measurement of the pressure. Recent advance in tactile sensing technology provides a potential. Using a tactile pressure sensor Tekscan 5315, we measured the normal pressure on a running belt in an in-situ belt conveyor facility with varied loading capacities. We conducted comparisons of measurements from the tactile pressure sensor and well-established independent instruments. The errors of measurements from the tactile pressure sensor were calculated. The pressure mapping on a <b>loaded</b> <b>belt</b> was presented.

Tactile pressure sensors have been proven to produce acceptable measurements of the pressure on <b>loaded</b> <b>belts</b> for scientific purpose. However, the accuracy of the measurements needs to be improved. A re-arrangement and post-process scheme is developed. Comparisons of the processed data and measurements from a conveyor scale shows that the scheme largely improves the accuracy We distinguish and compare the pressure on the wing belt sections and the centre belt section. The transversal distribution of the normal pressure in active and passive stress states are also presented and analyzed.

40|$|Restrained {{driver and}} right-front {{passenger}} kinematics and injury outcome in frontal collisions are compared using FARS data and human cadaver sled tests. The FARS {{data indicate that}} a frontal airbag may provide greater benefit for a passenger than for a driver. The thoracic injuries sustained by passenger subjects restrained by a force-limited, pretensioned belt and airbag are evaluated, and kinematics are compared to driver-side subjects. The injury-predictive ability of existing thoracic injury criteria is evaluated for passenger-side occupants. Driver and passenger kinematic differences are identified and the implications are discussed. The chest acceleration of the passenger-side subjects exhibited a bimodal profile with an initial (and global) maximum before the subject loaded the airbag. A second acceleration peak occurred as the subject <b>loaded</b> both the <b>belt</b> and the airbag.

5000|$|With {{assistance}} from firearms engineers at Fabrique Nationale de Herstal, Belgium, the Model 1919 was completely re-engineered into the [...]30 caliber M2 AN (Army-Navy) aircraft machine gun. The [...]30 in M2 AN Browning was widely adopted {{as both a}} fixed (offensive) and flexible (defensive) weapon on aircraft. Aircraft machine guns required light weight, firepower, and reliability, and achieving all three goals proved a difficult challenge, with the mandate for a closed bolt firing cycle to enable the gun to be safely and properly synchronized for fixed-mount, forward-aimed guns firing through a spinning propeller, a necessity on many single-engined fighter aircraft designs through to nearly the end of World War II. The receiver walls and operating components of the M2 were made thinner and lighter, and with air cooling provided by {{the speed of the}} aircraft, designers were able to reduce the barrel's weight and profile. As a result, the M2 weighed two-thirds that of the 1919A4, and the lightened mechanism gave it a rate of fire approaching 1,200 rpm (some variants could achieve 1,500 rpm), a necessity for engaging fast-moving aircraft. The M2's feed mechanism had to lift its own <b>loaded</b> <b>belt</b> out of the ammunition box and feed it into the gun, equivalent to a weight of 11 lb (5 kg). In Ordnance circles, the [...]30 M2 AN Browning had the reputation of being the most difficult-to-repair weapon in the entire US small arms inventory.|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} ability of the Hybrid III dummy and its {{associated}} injury criteria to discriminate sled tests with injurious conditions from those without. Ninety-three matched human cadaver and Hybrid III frontal sled tests over a range of impact speeds and restraint conditions are considered. Chest acceleration, deflection, and CTI are used as predictors of rib fracture outcome in the matched cadaver tests. Univariate and multivariate models are developed to evaluate the importance of the dummy measures relative to three experimental parameters (test speed, restraint condition, seating position) and three cadaver characteristics (age, gender, mass). The primary findings are, first, that chest acceleration has no utility for injury discrimination (Kruskal’s Gamma = 0. 0319, area under the receiver-operator characteristic = 0. 500). Second, the functional relationship between any Hybrid III injury measure and injury risk is sensitive to all three experimental factors. Injury risk models with consideration of this dependence are presented. It is shown that the Hybrid-III chest deflection corresponding to a given level of injury risk is greatest for air bag <b>loading,</b> lowest for <b>belt</b> <b>loading,</b> and intermediate for combined loading. This is shown to be non-biofidelic, since chest deflection as measured directly on the cadaver does not exhibit this sensitivity...|$|R
