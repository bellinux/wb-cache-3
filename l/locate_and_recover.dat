5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the search for}} the remains of the ship herself, there was considerable Australian interest in locating relics of the ship's south Pacific voyage. In 1886, the Working Men's Progress Association of Cooktown sought to recover the sixcannons thrown overboard when Endeavour grounded on the Great Barrier Reef. A £300 reward was offered for anyone who could <b>locate</b> <b>and</b> <b>recover</b> the guns, but searches that year and the next were fruitless and the money went unclaimed. Remains of equipment left at Endeavour River were discovered in around 1900, and in 1913 the crew of a merchant steamer erroneously claimed to have recovered an Endeavour cannon from shallow water near the Reef.|$|E

He then proposes {{to recover the}} Koh-i-Noor, a diamond {{in the possession of}} Queen Victoria, currently kept in the Tower of London. The twins accomplish the goal by infiltrating a gala held at that location; however Henry shows that the diamond they recover is a replica, and the true Koh-i-Noor is in fact in the safe hands of the British Assassins, thanks to Jayadeep's father Arbaaz Mir handing over the diamond to Jacob and Evie's father Ethan Frye.|$|E

After initial analysis of communications between the aircraft and a satellite, the surface search was moved the following week to the southern Indian Ocean. Between 18 March and 28 April, 19 vessels and 345 sorties by military aircraft searched over [...] The final phase of the search was a bathymetric survey and sonar search of the sea floor, about [...] south-west of Perth, Western Australia. With effect from 30 March 2014, the search was coordinated by the Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC), an Australian government agency established specifically to co-ordinate the search effort to <b>locate</b> <b>and</b> <b>recover</b> Flight 370, which primarily involved the Malaysian, Chinese, and Australian governments.|$|E

500|$|In 1994, in {{response}} to illegal metal detecting near the hoard find, a follow-up excavation of the field {{was carried out by}} the Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service. The hoard burial hole was re-excavated, and a single post hole at the southwest corner was identified; this may have been the location of a marker post to enable the depositors of the cache to <b>locate</b> <b>and</b> <b>recover</b> it in the future. Soil was removed in [...] spits for analysis in the area [...] around the find spot, and metal detectors were used to locate metal artefacts. This excavation recovered 335 items datable to the Roman period, mostly coins but also some box fittings. A series of late Bronze Age or early Iron Age post holes, which may have formed a structure, were found. However, no structural features of the Roman period were detected.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, a large, unknown {{shipwreck}} was {{encountered by}} the Fugro Seafloor Surveys vessel MV Moana Wave 1 while surveying {{the path of}} the Pacific Rim West Submarine Telecommunications Cable. One of the survey ship's crew theorised that the wreck, located at [...] in [...] of water, was Australia, but Fugro kept the information to themselves until 2002, when the company's Australian branch mentioned the discovery during a conference. This piqued the interest of a member of the New South Wales Heritage Office, who requested copies of the company's data. The size and location of the ship pointed towards it being Australia, but the depth meant verification through inspection could only be achieved with a remote operated vehicle (ROV). The RAN was approached in 2007 for assistance, but although they supported the project, the RAN did not have the equipment to assist. In March 2007, the United States Navy loaned the deep-sea ROV CURV-21 to the Australian Government, to <b>locate</b> <b>and</b> <b>recover</b> a Black Hawk helicopter which crashed during the Australian response to the 2006 Fijian coup d'état. While en route back to Australia, the ROV, carried aboard Defence Maritime Services vessel , was directed to Fugro's coordinates {{at the request of the}} NSW Heritage Office to verify and inspect the wreck. Video footage captured by the ROV allowed the NSW Heritage Office to confirm that the wreck was Australia by matching features like the superstructure and masts to historical photographs. Although initially sinking stern-first, the battlecruiser levelled out as she sank, with the aft mast the first to strike the bottom. After hitting the seabed, Australia slid about [...] to her final resting place. The wreck site is protected under the federal Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976.|$|E

This is underscored when an elder family member, the wizard Drone, is discovered dead and a twisted mage named Flattery makes his presence known.|$|E
50|$|The upper-stage rocket {{failed and}} the craft re-entered the {{atmosphere}} after reaching a sub-orbital apogee of 214 km.

The animals were thus still in the intact capsule when it returned to the surface.
