40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} retaining devices {{which are used}} to latch two elements or parts together and, more particularly, to gate latches for use in locking a gate to a wall bracket in a water pit utilized to store or handle hazardous materials. A retaining latch is provided comprising a <b>latch</b> <b>plate</b> which is rotatably mounted to {{each end of the}} top of the gate and a recessed opening, formed in the gate frame, for engaging an edge of the <b>latch</b> <b>plate.</b> The <b>latch</b> <b>plate</b> is circular in profile with one side cut away or flat, such that the <b>latch</b> <b>plate</b> is D-shaped. The remaining circular edge of the <b>latch</b> <b>plate</b> comprises steps of successively reduced thickness. The stepped edge of the <b>latch</b> <b>plate</b> fits inside a recessed opening formed in the gate frame. As the <b>latch</b> <b>plate</b> is rotated, alternate steps of the <b>latch</b> <b>plate</b> are engaged by the recessed opening. When the <b>latch</b> <b>plate</b> is rotated such that the flat portion of the <b>latch</b> <b>plate</b> faces the recessed opening in the gate frame, there is no connection between the opening and the <b>latch</b> <b>plate</b> and the gate is unlatched from the gate frame...|$|R

40|$|Occupants {{exposed to}} {{far-side}} crashes are those {{seated on the}} side of the vehicle opposite the struck side. This study uses the NASS/CDS 1988 - 98 to determine distributions of serious injuries among restrained occupants exposed to far-side crashes and the sources of the injuries. Vehicle-to-vehicle crash tests were conducted to study dummy kinematics. The NASS/CDS indicated that the head accounted for 45 % of the MAIS 4 + injuries in far-side collisions and the chest/abdomen accounted for 39 %. The opposite-side interior was the most frequent contact associated with driver AIS 3 + injuries (26. 9 %). The safety belt was second, accounting for 20. 8 %. Vehicle-to-vehicle side impact tests with a 60 degree crash vector indicated that different safety belt designs resulted in different amounts of head excursion for the far side Hybrid III dummy. For all three point belt systems tested, the shoulder belt was ineffective in preventing large amounts of head excursion. Restraint was achieved by the lap belt loading the abdomen. A single retractor design with low friction sliding <b>latch</b> <b>plate</b> permitted the greatest head excursion in the far side crash tests.

50|$|A CPU socket {{is made of}} plastic, {{and comes}} with a lever or latch, and with metal {{contacts}} {{for each of the}} pins or lands on the CPU. Many packages are keyed to ensure the proper insertion of the CPU. CPUs with a PGA (pin grid array) package are inserted into the socket and the latch is closed. CPUs with an LGA package are inserted into the socket, the <b>latch</b> <b>plate</b> is flipped into position atop the CPU, and the lever is lowered and locked into place, pressing the CPU's contacts firmly against the socket's lands and ensuring a good connection, as well as increased mechanical stability.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Unsteady {{aerodynamic}} {{forces were}} calculated for cross sections such as flat <b>plate,</b> <b>box</b> girder and slotted box girder. Seven methods of CFD were applied.
