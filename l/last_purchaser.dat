But I found time {{meanwhile}} to learn by a few questions from our veiled friend something of her captivity. She had seen her father massacred before her eyes at Khartoum, and had then been sold away to a merchant, who conveyed her by degrees and by various exchanges across the desert through lonely spots to the Senoosi oasis. There she had lived all those years with the chief to whom her <b>last</b> <b>purchaser</b> had trafficked her. She {{did not even know}} that her husband's village {{was an integral part of}} the Khedive's territory; far less that the English were now in practical occupation of Egypt. She had heard nothing and learnt nothing since that fateful day; she had waited in vain for the off-chance of a deliverer.|$|E
40|$|A observação do tríptico “Jardim das Delícias”, de Hieronymus Bosch constitui o ponto de partida para um curto ensaio sobre a possível interpretação desta obra por parte do seu último comprador, Filipe II de Espanha. Por sua vez, este ensaio conduz à proposta de um modelo, baseado em três categorias de análise, para a interpretação crítica do percurso global que a humanidade tem vindo a trilhar desde o início das grandes navegações intercontinentais, inicialmente levadas a cabo por portugueses e espanhóis. O modelo proposto pretende constituir um contributo para a desfragmentação da memória de um longo processo marcado pela tensão entre forças hegemónicas e dinâmicas de interculturalidade.

He described the land containing for a lime quarry, and lime kiln as heavily timbered without improvements and suitable for wheat and corn.

We are divided into classes by birth and constitution, and each can do much in its own sphere. I am a shawl pin, {{and it would be}} foolish in me to aspire to the duties of those dainty lace pins made to fasten a collar. I am {{contented}} with my lot, however, and, being of a strong make and enterprising spirit, have had many adventures, some perils, and great satisfactions since I left the factory long ago. I well remember how eagerly I looked about me when the paper in which I lived, with some hundreds of relations, was hung up in a shop window, to display our glittering ranks and tempt people to buy. At <b>last</b> a <b>purchaser</b> came, a dashing young lady who bought us with several other fancy articles, and carried us away in a smart little bag, humming and talking to herself, in what I thought a very curious way.|$|R
40|$|This {{assessment}} {{was made in}} response to a request from the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs that OTA examine the issues surrounding a proposal to require that commercial explosives and gunpowders be manufactured with “taggants” as an aid to law enforcement. Two types of taggants are contemplated: ● “identification taggants ” would be designed to survive an explosion, and would carry a code which would enable those who recovered such taggants from the debris of a criminal bombing to assemble a list of the <b>last</b> legal <b>purchasers</b> of the batch of explosives used to make the bomb; ● “detection taggants ” would be designed to emit a vapor which would escape from a suitcase, package, etc., so that a taggant-sensing machine at an airport or public building could detect the presence of concealed explosives. The proposal to require taggants is generally viewed as helpful by the law enforcement community, and opposed by the manufacturers of explosives (and some others) on the grounds that taggants would be ineffective, unsafe, and too costly. The report addresses four major questions. First, it reviews the program to develo...|$|R
