40|$|Chiral heteropolymers such as larger {{globular}} proteins can simultaneously support multiple length scales. The {{interplay between}} different scales brings about conformational diversity, and governs {{the structure of}} the energy landscape. Multiple scales produces also complex dynamics, which in the case of proteins sustains <b>live</b> <b>matter.</b> However, thus far no clear understanding exist, how to distinguish the various scales that determine the structure and dynamics of a complex protein. Here we propose a systematic method to identify the scales in chiral heteropolymers such as a protein. For this we introduce a novel order parameter, that not only reveals the scales but also probes the phase structure. In particular, we argue that a chiral heteropolymer can simultaneously display traits of several different phases, contingent on the length scale at which it is scrutinized. Our approach builds on a variant of Kadanoff's block-spin transformation that we employ to coarse grain piecewise linear chains such as the Cα backbone of a protein. We derive analytically and then verify numerically a number of properties that the order parameter can display. We demonstrate how, in the case of crystallographic protein structures in Protein Data Bank, the order parameter reveals the presence of different length scales, and we propose that a relation must exist between the scales, phases, and the complexity of folding pathways.

40|$|African Star Grass {{is one of}} the forage {{resources}} {{most commonly}} used by farmers in regions with warm-humid climates. This study was carried out to determine the nutritional and agronomic characteristics of African Star Grass (Cynodon plectostachyus) through the following variables: crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), organic matter digestibility (OMD), net forage accumulation (NFA), stem:leaf ratio, and live:dead matter ratio in the three pastures evaluated. The work took place from April 2007 to March 2008, with evaluations carried out on a monthly basis. The data were analyzed in a randomized block design in which the blocks were the pastures, and the treatments were the months of evaluation. There were no differences between the pastures evaluated for the NDF, ADF or OMD (P> 0. 05). Differences were found, however, in CP, while in the monthly evaluation, {{differences were found between the}} periods evaluated (P< 0. 05) for these variables. Differences were also found in the agronomic evaluation of pastures (P< 0. 05) among height of pasture, net forage accumulation (NFA), <b>live</b> <b>matter,</b> dead matter, leaf and stem, both among pastures and in the monthly evaluations.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis is a discursive investigation of contested political discourse. Using Discursive Psychology, I analyse broadcast political debates on the European Union to explore how politicians advocate and defend their political positions in an argumentative context of justification and criticism. Past research in social psychology and cognate disciplines has investigated ideology from a multitude of views. Following a move away from mainstream approaches I demonstrate how some qualitative approaches treat it as a <b>live</b> <b>matter</b> in broadcast political debates. For my data I have chosen the controversial political battleground that is the European Union {{and what it means}} for Britain. The contribution of Discursive Psychology comes in highlighting the contested, rhetorical, nature of ideology. In this thesis I draw upon Discursive Psychology to explore how this contestation unfolds as situated practice in multi-party conversations about the EU. Politicians will argue in favour or against the EU, often on the grounds of what the implication is for Britain. In this thesis I argue that Discursive Psychology is best equipped to allow us to study this as an activity; an observable, and contextual, social action. The analytical chapters focus on three interrelated aspects of political argumentation: the construction and use of factual claims (including demonstrations of knowledge statuses) and counterclaims, the role of overlapping talk, and the function of laughter and derision. The first analytical chapter seeks to elucidate some {{of the ways in which}} facts and situated knowledge displays of them are oriented to as an argumentative matter and how they can be challenged. The second analytic chapter illustrates the role played by overlapping talk and challenges in managing the argument at hand. The last analytic chapter focuses on the accomplishment of derision in broadcast political debates, particularly on how derision can be used as form of counterclaim. Ultimately, this thesis demonstrates the usefulness of Discursive Psychology in understanding the discursive dynamics of mobilisation, contestation, and defence of contrasting viewpoints in the service of political argumentation. Discursive Psychology can help social psychologists get a much deeper appreciation of the situated, and discursively dynamic, nature of political argumentation and conflict in talk...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{extensive}} {{debate on the}} potential environmental impact of dairy farms {{and in particular the}} effect of dairy farms on the nitrogen cycle and the effect that this has on ecosystems. Within New Zealand and in particular in the South Island, the expansion of dairying and the adoption of new dairy systems has led to this becoming an increasingly important issue, locally through its effect on water quality and the environment and nationally and internationally through the production of green house gases. Increases in nitrogen usage at the expense of clover nitrogen fixation, irrigation, stocking rate and the introduction of dairy cows onto light free draining soils previously the preserve of arable or sheep farming has led to concern as to the effect intensive pastoral dairying may have on the nitrogen dynamics of the farm and the environment. This study is designed to assess how changes in grazing management in particular changes in pre-grazing and post-grazing residuals alter the clover/ryegrass balance on the farm and the effect that this has on the farm’s nitrogen dynamics. The effects of qualitative changes in grazing management on pasture composition are well established but little is known of the effect of quantitative changes in pasture management on composition, in particular the effect of grazing residuals. There are a number of detailed models of the physiological processes in the energy and nutrient cycling in plants, animals and the soil. There are a smaller number of whole farm models that through integration and simplification of component models attempt to represent the flux of nutrients though a dairy farm. None of these whole farm models is currently able to model the nitrogen flux through a dairy farm at a sufficient level of resolution to capture differences in pasture composition as these occur spatially, temporally and in response to grazing management. This project sought to better understand the nitrogen dynamics on a dairy farm by constructing and then linking component models – a pasture composition and growth model, a cow model, an excretal return model, a soil model and a water balance model – within a whole farm management schedule. The formal null hypothesis is that the mechanistic, mathematical model constructed for this PhD cannot capture and explain the full range of the changes in soil water content, soil nitrogen status, pasture production and composition and animal production, following the alteration in management of the dairy farm between 2002 and 2004. Individual component models were constructed by the author using the computer software package (Matlab) and validated against data extracted from the literature. The models were then converted into one simulation package using C-sharp as the source code language by Elizabeth Post, Senior Computer Scientist at Lincoln Ventures Ltd, Lincoln, New Zealand and the author. This model was then used to investigate the nitrogen dynamics of a dairy farm: the relationship with pasture composition and whether small changes in pasture residuals make a difference to pasture composition and nitrogen dynamics. Two different simulations were run based on the management practice of Lincoln University Dairy farm (LUDF) over two dairy seasons (2002 - 03 and 2003 - 04) and validated against the data recorded on this farm. In 2002 - 03, 50 cows were over wintered and 580 cows were subsequently milked on 200 ha. Post grazing residuals where maintained at 1600 - 1750 KgDM/ha. In 2003 - 04, 125 cows were overwintered and 635 cows were milked on 200 ha with post grazing residuals maintained at 1400 KgDm/ha. All models operate on a daily time step. Within the pasture model composition is described by 9 state variables describing different components of the pasture and pasture growth is modelled mechanistically from a calculation of component photosynthesis. A further 9 state variables describe the nitrogen composition of the pasture components. The soil model is a variable two layer, mechanistic representation, parametised for the shallow, stony soils of LUDF. Soil water status is an input for the pasture model while water uptake by the growing plants affects the soil water balance within the soil model. Animal intake and production are modelled mechanistically with model cows described in terms of their age, genetic merit, body weight, breed, pregnancy status, conception date and body condition score. Each cow type produces a different quantity of urinary and faecal excretion which varies with dry matter intake, milk yield and the sodium and potassium status of the pasture. Excretal nitrogen composition is predicted within a separate model which calculates daily nitrogen excretion in faeces, urine and milk. Excretions are deposited randomly over the grazed area and account is taken of overlapping excretions that are created on the same day and overlaps that occur with older excretal patches deposited in previous grazing rounds. Each excretal patch has its own associated pasture, water and soil model reflecting the differences in nitrogen status between patches. Grazing preference is expressed within the model between different classes of excretal patch and between excretal patches and the base pasture and between clover and grass. Supplementary silage is conserved and fed according to the management schedule of LUDF. Cows calve, become pregnant and are dried off within the model according to the relevant records from LUDF. Cows are deemed to arrive on the farm on the day of calving and to leave on the day that drying off is finished (a 5 day procedure within the model), except for those cows that are overwintering which remain on the farm. The soil model has multiple nitrogen/carbon pools and is dynamically linked to all the other models. External nitrogen losses from the system are modelled as volatilisation, leaching and denitrification, with pasture nitrogen uptake from the soil model and fixation by clover from the atmosphere. Both the individual component models and the final assembled composite model were successful in matching the available data in terms of pasture and animal production, pasture composition, soil water balance and nitrogen status and external losses. The model indicates that the low residual, high stocking rate farm returns more excreta to the soil. However, this is countered by a reduction in the amount of dead material returned to the paddock and this reduces the relative size of the pool of nitrogen in the dead organic matter. This produces a relative lack of substrate for the soil microbes which are thus unable to exploit all of the nitrogen in the available pool. Soil ammonium and nitrate pools are also increased from the increase in faecal and urinary return so precipitating an immobilising flux from these larger pools to the smaller pool of nitrogen available to the soil microbes. However, the relative inability of the soil bacteria to fully exploit this means that the production of soil organic <b>live</b> <b>matter</b> and the resulting mineralising flux from the dead organic matter pool through the available pool to the ammonium and nitrate pools is reduced. The larger ammonium and nitrate pools will also be associated with increased external losses from the system as denitrification, leaching and volatilisation are increased. The increase in the clover percentage within the sward in 2003 - 04 led to greater nitrogen fixation and the model suggests that some of the extra nitrogen is effectively captured by the animals in increased production. However, the reduction in the return of dead matter coupled with an increase in excretal return and the consequent increase in the mineral nitrogen pools within the soil lead to greater losses of nitrogen from the soil...|$|E
