5|$|In 2008, the red <b>lemur,</b> Eulemur rufus, {{was split}} into two species, Eulemur rufus (red <b>lemur)</b> and Eulemur rufifrons (red-fronted <b>lemur).</b> Also, Eulemur rufus was {{previously}} known as the red-fronted <b>lemur,</b> but was renamed the red <b>lemur,</b> while Eulemur rufifrons assumed its former name.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in 1904, Herbert F. Standing {{had named}} a {{different}} species {{using the same}} name, <b>Lemur</b> jullyi, and named another species <b>Lemur</b> maziensis. He noted similarities between this group and the ruffed lemurs, then considered a single species, <b>Lemur</b> varius. In 1908, Standing named another species in the group, <b>Lemur</b> majori, and included his <b>Lemur</b> maziensis in L.jullyi. The name Pachylemur was introduced for these animals in 1948 by Charles Lamberton, who grouped <b>Lemur</b> insignis, <b>Lemur</b> majori, and <b>Lemur</b> jullyi in a subgenus of the genus <b>Lemur.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bark {{and plant}} exudates such as tree sap are {{consumed}} {{by a few}} <b>lemur</b> species. The exploitation of exudates {{has been reported in}} 18 plant species and only in the dry regions in the south and west of Madagascar. Only the Masoala fork-marked <b>lemur</b> (Phaner furcifer) and Coquerel's giant mouse <b>lemur</b> regularly consume tree sap. Bark has never been reported as an important food item in <b>lemur</b> diets, but at least four species eat it: the aye-aye, the red-tailed sportive <b>lemur</b> (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), the common brown <b>lemur</b> (Eulemur fulvus), and Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi). Most bark feeding is directly linked to exudate feeding, except for the aye-aye's bark feeding on Afzelia bijuga (genus Afzelia) at Nosy Mangabe in the northeast.|$|E
50|$|The mouse <b>lemurs</b> are nocturnal <b>lemurs</b> of {{the genus}} Microcebus. Like all <b>lemurs,</b> mouse <b>lemurs</b> are native to Madagascar.|$|R
50|$|Primates kept {{at the zoo}} include siamang, Colombian black spider monkeys, {{black-and-white}} ruffed <b>lemurs,</b> Goeldi's monkeys, Geoffroy's marmosets, ring-tailed <b>lemurs,</b> golden lion tamarins, golden-headed lion tamarins, Sclater's <b>lemurs,</b> Sambirano bamboo <b>lemurs,</b> red ruffed <b>lemurs,</b> pygmy marmosets, black-and-white colobus monkeys, red-bellied <b>lemurs,</b> white-faced saki monkeys, cotton-top tamarins, and emperor tamarins.|$|R
500|$|Ruffed <b>lemurs</b> either {{demonstrate}} feeding dominance or divide {{resources by}} using different forest strata. They are dominant over red-bellied <b>lemurs,</b> while eastern lesser bamboo <b>lemurs</b> avoid encountering them altogether. White-headed <b>lemurs,</b> {{on the other}} hand, prefer the understory and lower canopy, below , while the ruffed <b>lemurs</b> mainly keep to the upper canopy, above [...] Play has even been observed between infant ruffed <b>lemurs</b> and white-headed <b>lemurs.</b>|$|R
5|$|Captive <b>lemur</b> {{populations are}} {{maintained}} locally {{and outside of}} Madagascar in many zoos, although the diversity of species is limited. Sikafas, for instance, do not survive well in captivity, so few facilities have them. The largest captive <b>lemur</b> population {{can be found at}} the Duke <b>Lemur</b> Center (DLC), whose mission includes non-invasive research, conservation (e.g. captive breeding), and public education. Another large <b>lemur</b> colony the Myakka City <b>Lemur</b> Reserve run by the <b>Lemur</b> Conservation Foundation (LCF), which also hosts <b>lemur</b> research. In Madagascar, Lemurs' Park is a free-range, private facility southwest of Antananarivo that exhibits lemurs for the public while also rehabilitating captive-born lemurs for reintroduction into the wild.|$|E
5|$|Carl Linnaeus, {{the founder}} of modern {{binomial}} nomenclature, gave lemurs their name as early as 1758, when he used it in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae. He included three species under the genus Lemur: <b>Lemur</b> tardigradus (the red slender loris, now known as Loris tardigradus), <b>Lemur</b> catta (the ring-tailed <b>lemur),</b> and <b>Lemur</b> volans (the Philippine colugo, now known as Cynocephalus volans).|$|E
5|$|Since 1979, Pachylemur has {{generally}} been regarded as a distinct genus, but some classifications include the genus in <b>Lemur</b> or the ruffed <b>lemur</b> genus Varecia. In a 1982 review, Ian Tattersall recognized two species, <b>Lemur</b> insignis and <b>Lemur</b> jullyi. He did not regard Pachylemur as a distinct genus or even subgenus. As Tattersall noted, <b>Lemur</b> jullyi Standing, 1904, is preoccupied by Palaeochirogalus jullyi Grandidier, 1899, and thus invalid. However, both names are based on material from the central plateau of Madagascar and Tattersall therefore presumed that they {{belong to the same}} species, which he could continue to call <b>Lemur</b> jullyi. Recent classifications recognize Pachylemur as a valid genus with two species—P.insignis (Filhol, 1895) and P.jullyi (Grandidier, 1899)—but express doubt about the distinction between the two species.|$|E
50|$|Like all {{sportive}} <b>lemurs,</b> {{they can}} easily be confused with woolly <b>lemurs</b> (genus Avahi), and sometimes with the much smaller dwarf <b>lemurs</b> (genus Cheirogaleus). Unlike the woolly <b>lemurs,</b> sportive <b>lemurs</b> have prominent ears, and they lack the white patches usually found on the thighs of woolly <b>lemurs.</b> All sportive <b>lemurs</b> have long legs compared to their arms and trunk and the face is covered with short hairs.|$|R
50|$|Ruffed <b>lemurs</b> either {{demonstrate}} feeding dominance or divide {{resources by}} using different forest strata. They are dominant over red-bellied <b>lemurs,</b> while eastern lesser bamboo <b>lemurs</b> avoid encountering them altogether. White-headed <b>lemurs,</b> {{on the other}} hand, prefer the understory and lower canopy, below 15 m, while the ruffed <b>lemurs</b> mainly keep to the upper canopy, above 15 m. Play has even been observed between infant ruffed <b>lemurs</b> and white-headed <b>lemurs.</b>|$|R
5|$|From the 1970s to the 1990s, {{there have}} been {{suggestions}} that the ruffed <b>lemurs</b> {{might be related to}} indriids or a sister group to Lemuridae and Indriidae and that the bamboo <b>lemurs</b> are related to the sportive <b>lemurs,</b> but neither view is supported by molecular phylogeny. The sportive <b>lemurs</b> and the extinct koala <b>lemurs</b> (Megaladapidae) both lack upper incisors in the permanent dentition, and in 1981, Groves placed both together in the family Megaladapidae, which he renamed Lepilemuridae in 2005 because that older name takes precedence. Genetic research does not support a close relationship between the sportive and koala <b>lemurs</b> and instead places the koala <b>lemurs</b> as a sister group to Lemuridae; therefore, the two are now placed in separate families (Lepilemuridae for the sportive <b>lemurs</b> and Megaladapidae for the koala <b>lemurs).</b> The sloth <b>lemurs</b> (Palaeopropithecidae) and monkey <b>lemurs</b> (Archaeolemuridae) were classified as subfamilies within Indriidae as late as 1982, but are now recognized as separate families.|$|R
5|$|Since cone cells make {{color vision}} possible, the high {{prevalence}} of rod cells in <b>lemur</b> eyes suggest {{they have not}} evolved color vision. The most studied <b>lemur,</b> the ring-tailed <b>lemur,</b> {{has been shown to}} have blue-yellow vision, but lacks the ability to distinguish red and green hues. Due to polymorphism in opsin genes, which code for color receptivity, trichromatic vision may rarely occur in females of a few <b>lemur</b> species, such as Coquerel's sifaka (Propithecus coquereli) and the red ruffed <b>lemur</b> (Varecia rubra). Most lemurs, therefore, are either monochromats or dichromats.|$|E
5|$|The Masoala fork-marked <b>lemur</b> {{is found}} on the Masoala Peninsula in the {{northeast}} of the island, while the Amber Mountain fork-marked <b>lemur</b> {{is located in the}} far north of the island, particularly at Amber Mountain National Park. Pariente's fork-marked <b>lemur</b> is found in the Sambirano region in the northwest, and the pale fork-marked <b>lemur</b> is in the west of the island.|$|E
5|$|After the {{offspring}} are born, lemurs either carry them around or stash them while foraging. When transported, the infants either {{cling to the}} mother's fur or are carried in the mouth by the scruff. In some species, such as bamboo lemurs, infants are carried by mouth until {{they are able to}} cling to their mother's fur. Species that park their offspring include nocturnal species (e.g. mouse lemurs, sportive lemurs, and dwarf lemurs), bamboo lemurs, and ruffed lemurs. In the case of the ruffed lemurs, the young are altricial and the mothers build nests for them, much like the smaller, nocturnal <b>lemur</b> species. Woolly lemurs are unusual for nocturnal lemurs because they live in cohesive family groups and carry their single offspring with them rather than parking them. Alloparenting (multiple or group parenting) has been reported in all <b>lemur</b> families except the sportive lemurs and aye-aye. Allonursing is also known to occur in several <b>lemur</b> groups. Even males have been observed caring for infants in species such as the red-bellied <b>lemur,</b> mongoose <b>lemur,</b> eastern lesser bamboo <b>lemur,</b> silky sifaka, fat-tailed dwarf <b>lemur,</b> and ruffed lemurs.|$|E
50|$|True <b>lemurs,</b> {{also known}} as brown <b>lemurs,</b> are the <b>lemurs</b> in genus Eulemur. They are {{medium-sized}} primates that live exclusively on Madagascar.|$|R
50|$|As of 2016, {{the park}} is home to 32 species of primate, {{including}} Peruvian squirrel monkeys, black howler monkeys, Geoffroy's marmosets, red titi monkeys, white-faced saki monkeys, geladas, bonobos, ring-tailed <b>lemurs,</b> crowned <b>lemurs,</b> red ruffed <b>lemurs,</b> black-and-white ruffed <b>lemurs,</b> red-faced spider monkeys, pileated gibbons, western lowland gorillas, lesser spot-nosed monkeys, eastern black-and-white colobus monkeys, pygmy marmosets, mandrills, roloway monkeys, southern white-cheeked gibbons, golden-headed lion tamarins, emperor tamarins, white-belted black-and-white ruffed <b>lemurs,</b> black <b>lemurs,</b> red-bellied <b>lemurs,</b> yellow-breasted capuchins, barbary macaques, western chimpanzees, white-throated capuchins, golden-handed tamarins, silvery marmosets, golden lion tamarins, brown spider monkeys and woolly monkeys.|$|R
5|$|Family Cheirogaleidae {{consists}} of the mouse <b>lemurs</b> (smallest of all primates), the dwarf <b>lemurs,</b> and the fork-marked <b>lemurs</b> and their allies. There are 37extant species.|$|R
5|$|Although <b>lemur</b> {{taxonomy}} had developed, it was {{not until}} the 1950s and 1960s that the in-situ (or on-site) study of <b>lemur</b> behavior and ecology began to blossom. Jean-Jacques Petter and Arlette Petter-Rousseaux toured Madagascar in 1956 and 1957, surveying many of its <b>lemur</b> species and making important observations about their social groupings and reproduction. In 1960, the year of Madagascar's independence, David Attenborough introduced lemurs to the West with a commercial film. Under the guidance of John Buettner-Janusch, who founded the Duke <b>Lemur</b> Center in 1966, Alison Jolly traveled to Madagascar in 1962 to study the diet and social behavior of the ring-tailed <b>lemur</b> and Verreaux's sifaka at Berenty Private Reserve. The Petters and Jolly spawned a new era of interest in <b>lemur</b> ecology and behavior and were shortly followed by anthropologists such as Alison Richard, Robert Sussman, Ian Tattersall, and many others. Following the political turmoil of the mid-1970s and Madagascar's revolution, field studies resumed in the 1980s, thanks in part to the renewed involvement of the Duke <b>Lemur</b> Center under the direction of Elwyn L. Simons and the conservation efforts of Patricia Wright. In the decades that followed, huge strides have been made in <b>lemur</b> studies and many new species have been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Ex situ {{research}} (or off-site research) is also {{popular among}} researchers looking {{to answer questions}} {{that are difficult to}} test in the field. For example, efforts to sequence the genome of the gray mouse <b>lemur</b> will help researchers understand which genetic traits set primates apart from other mammals and will ultimately help understand what genomic traits set humans apart from other primates. One of the foremost <b>lemur</b> research facilities is the Duke <b>Lemur</b> Center (DLC) in Durham, North Carolina. It maintains the largest captive <b>lemur</b> population outside of Madagascar, which it maintains for non-invasive research and captive breeding. Many important research projects have been carried out there, including studies of <b>lemur</b> vocalizations, basic locomotor research, the kinematics of bipedalism, the effects of social complexity transitive reasoning, and cognition studies involving a lemur's ability to organize and retrieve sequences from memory. Other facilities, such as the <b>Lemur</b> Conservation Foundation, located near Myakka City, Florida, have also hosted research projects, such as one that looked at lemurs' ability to preferentially select tools based on functional qualities.|$|E
5|$|Found in {{tropical}} moist lowland and montane forests in southeastern Madagascar, the collared brown <b>lemur</b> occurs {{west to the}} forests of Kalambatritra and in the south from Tôlanaro north to the Mananara River. The Mananara River is {{the boundary between the}} ranges of the collared brown <b>lemur</b> and the Gray-headed <b>Lemur</b> to the north. The collared brown <b>lemur</b> {{can be found in the}} littoral forests of Mandena Conservation Zone, Sainte Luce Reserve, and Andohahela National Park.|$|E
50|$|The dwarf <b>lemurs</b> are the <b>lemurs</b> of {{the genus}} Cheirogaleus. All of the species in this genus, like all other <b>lemurs,</b> are native to Madagascar.|$|R
50|$|Apenheul is home {{to about}} 70 species of animals, 35 of which are primates.

5|$|French {{zoologist}} Henri Filhol was {{the first}} to scientifically describe a species of Pachylemur; he named <b>Lemur</b> insignis and <b>Lemur</b> intermedius in 1895 {{on the basis of a}} few subfossil bones. Descriptions of other species now placed in Pachylemur quickly followed. In 1899, Guillaume Grandidier named a new genus and species, Palaeochirogalus jullyi, on the basis of two teeth from Antsirabe, central Madagascar, which he thought similar to dwarf lemurs (Cheirogaleus). In 1903, Grafton Elliot Smith placed this species in the genus <b>Lemur</b> (as <b>Lemur</b> jullyi), and in 1905, Grandidier himself considered the species a synonym of <b>Lemur</b> insignis.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the {{discovery}} of Bugtilemur, a fossil primate from Pakistan dating to the Oligocene and initially {{thought to be a}} cheirogaleid <b>lemur,</b> further challenged the theory of <b>lemur</b> origins; however, it was later shown to be a type of adapiform primate and not a <b>lemur.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Lemur</b> {{behavior}} is as variable as <b>lemur</b> morphology. Differences in diet, social systems, activity patterns, locomotion, communication, predator avoidance tactics, breeding systems, and intelligence levels help define <b>lemur</b> taxa and set individual species {{apart from the}} rest. Although trends frequently distinguish the smaller, nocturnal lemurs from the larger, diurnal lemurs, there are often exceptions that help exemplify the unique and diverse nature of these Malagasy primates.|$|E
5000|$|Makira Outpost : Makira Outpost is {{an exhibit}} {{which opened in}} the summer of 2007 and is home to the zoo's <b>lemurs.</b> The new exhibit uses many new exhibit methods.

5000|$|The monkey <b>lemurs</b> [...] or baboon <b>lemurs</b> (Archaeolemuridae) are a {{recently}} extinct family of <b>lemurs</b> known from skeletal remains from sites on Madagascar dated to 1000 to 3000 years ago.|$|R
5|$|Lemurs are {{mentioned}} in sailors' voyage logs {{as far back}} as 1608 and in 1658 that at least seven <b>lemur</b> species were described in detail by the French merchant, Étienne de Flacourt, who may also have been the only westerner to see and chronicle the existence of a giant (now extinct) <b>lemur,</b> which he called the tretretretre. Around 1703 merchants and sailors began bringing lemurs back to Europe, at which time James Petiver, an apothecary in London, described and illustrated the mongoose <b>lemur.</b> Starting in 1751, the London illustrator George Edwards began describing and illustrating some <b>lemur</b> species, of which a few were included in various editions of Systema Naturae by Carl Linnaeus. In the 1760s and 1770s, French naturalists Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon and Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton began describing the anatomy of several <b>lemur</b> species. The first traveling naturalist to comment on lemurs was Philibert Commerçon in 1771, although it was Pierre Sonnerat who recorded a greater variety of <b>lemur</b> species during his travels.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs are unusual {{since they}} have great {{variability}} in their social structure, yet generally lack sexual dimorphism in size and canine tooth morphology. However, some species tend towards having larger females, and two species of true <b>lemur</b> (genus Eulemur), the gray-headed <b>lemur</b> (E. albocollaris) and the red <b>lemur</b> (E. rufus), exhibit size differences in canine teeth. True lemurs show sexual dichromatism (sexual differences in fur coloration), but {{the difference between the}} genders varies from strikingly obvious, as in the blue-eyed black <b>lemur</b> (E. macaco), to nearly imperceptible {{in the case of the}} common brown <b>lemur</b> (E. fulvus).|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have either}} {{presently}} or formerly filled the ecological niches normally occupied by monkeys, squirrels, woodpeckers, and grazing ungulates. With {{the diversity of}} adaptations for specific ecological niches, habitat selections among <b>lemur</b> families and some genera are often very distinct, thus minimizing competition. In nocturnal lemurs from the more seasonal forests in the west, up to five species can coexist during the wet season due to high food abundance. However, to endure the extreme dry season, {{three of the five}} species utilize different dietary patterns and their underlying physiological traits to allow them to coexist: fork-marked lemurs feed on tree gum, sportive lemurs feed on leaves, and giant mouse lemurs sometimes feed on insect secretions. The other two species, the gray mouse <b>lemur</b> and the fat-tailed dwarf <b>lemur</b> (Cheirogaleus medius), avoid competition through reduced activity. The gray mouse <b>lemur</b> uses bouts of torpor, while the fat-tailed dwarf <b>lemur</b> hibernates completely. Similarly, on the east coast entire genera focus on specific food to avoid too much niche overlap. True lemurs and ruffed lemurs are frugivorous, indriids are folivorous, and bamboo lemurs specialize in bamboo and other grasses. Once again, seasonal dietary differences as well as subtle differences in substrate preferences, forest strata used, activity cycle, and social organization enable <b>lemur</b> species to coexist, although this time the species are more closely related and have similar niches. A classic example involves resource partitioning between three species of bamboo <b>lemur</b> that live in close proximity in small forested areas: the golden bamboo <b>lemur,</b> the greater bamboo <b>lemur,</b> and the eastern lesser bamboo <b>lemur</b> (Hapalemur griseus). Each utilizes either different species of bamboo, different parts of the plant, or different layers in the forest. Nutrient and toxin content (such as cyanide) help regulate food selection, though seasonal food preferences are also known to play a role.|$|E
25|$|Note: Ring-tailed <b>lemurs,</b> red ruffed <b>lemurs,</b> and {{black-and-white}} ruffed <b>lemurs</b> were {{on display}} in the Lied Jungle, but were moved to the zoo's newest exhibit, Expedition Madagascar, in 2010 because they are from Madagascar.|$|R
50|$|Both brown <b>lemurs</b> {{and mouse}} <b>lemurs</b> were {{initially}} divided {{into a small}} number of species, either with no distinguishable subspecies (in the case of mouse <b>lemurs)</b> or with several distinguishable subspecies (in the case of brown <b>lemurs).</b> With molecular research suggesting a more distant split in both genera, these subspecies or undistinguished populations have been promoted to species status.|$|R
500|$|Like other cheirogaleids, {{the dental}} formula for giant mouse <b>lemurs</b> is {{on each side}} of the mouth, top and bottom, there are two incisors, one canine, three premolars, and three molars—a total of 36teeth. Their upper teeth {{converge}} towards the front of the mouth, but are straighter than those in mouse <b>lemurs.</b> The first upper premolar (P2) is relatively small, but nearly as tall as the next premolar (P3). Unlike mouse <b>lemurs</b> and more like dwarf <b>lemurs,</b> giant mouse <b>lemurs</b> have a prominent anterior lower premolar (P2). Also more aligned with dwarf <b>lemurs,</b> the first two upper molars (M1–2) have a more anterior hypocone that sits opposite the metacone, compared to the mouse lemurs' more posterior hypocone, which is presumably a symplesiomorphic (ancestral) trait. Also on M1 and M2, the cingulum (a crest or ridge on the tongue side) comprises two small cuspules. In all other dental characteristics, giant mouse <b>lemurs</b> are noticeably similar to both dwarf and mouse <b>lemurs.</b>|$|R
