40|$|Confronted with traditional-looking Moroccan {{furniture}} {{in a house}} where Moroccan migrants or their descendants live, one may interpret this furniture as an ethnic symbol,underlining the Moroccan, North African or Arabic background of the owners. Analysing interviews and discussions on the Internet, this article shows that the furniture has many other significances as well. It not only functions as an ethnic symbol, but also signals affluence and fashionability, and it appeals in different, often emotional ways to the senses of those who experience the furniture by sitting on it while eating, drinking and talking. Apparently the traditional-looking Moroccan furniture {{has the capacity to}} transport people to other worlds. For those who spent their childhood in Morocco, these are often worlds that are part of their embodied memory, while for those who grew up <b>outside</b> <b>Morocco,</b> these are more often worlds that are primarily imagined and appropriated through aesthetic images in glossy magazines and coffee-table books. In both cases however, traditionallooking Moroccan furniture appear to respond to an emotional longing for the (re-) creation of experiences of conviviality.

Here, we investigated whether such landings cause less noise annoyance than a regular stepwise approach. Both landing types were compared {{in a controlled}} laboratory setting with a Virtual Community Noise Simulator (VCNS), using four audio samples: an overflight during a regular approach (2000  ft altitude) and three aircraft performing CDAs at respectively 3000, 4000 and 5000  ft.

The other two CDA samples were derived from the recording at 4000  ft. Participants were asked to rate all flyover samples twice while being immersed in the virtual environment.

40|$|Mating {{signals that}} {{increase}} attractiveness of males to females can also increase conspicuousness of the signaler to predators and parasites. We investigated the acoustic preference of species of blood-sucking flies {{of the genus}} Corethrella (Diptera: Corethrellidae), which eavesdrop on the sexual advertisement signals of t�ngara frogs (Physalaemus pustulosus). Male frogs of this species facultatively produce 2 types of mating calls: simple (whines alone) and complex (whines and chucks). We tested the acoustic preference of the flies {{and their ability to}} locate their host when the frogs produce simple or complex calls. The flies exhibited phonotaxis to both types of calls but were preferentially attracted to complex calls. We show that acoustic information alone is sufficient for the flies' accurate localization of calling frogs. Complex calls, however, were not approached at closer distance or with decreased landing error (i. e., proportion of <b>landings</b> <b>outside</b> the target) than simple calls, suggesting that call structure does not influence localization performance. Female t�ngara frogs and frog-eating bats (Trachops cirrhosus) also prefer complex to simple t�ngara frog calls. Thus, intended and unintended receivers with different ear morphologies exhibit the same preference for a specific t�ngara frog call type.

40|$|TYLCV-IS 76 is {{an unusual}} {{recombinant}} between the highly recombinogenic tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV), two Mediterranean begomoviruses (Geminiviridae). In contrast with the previously reported TYLCV/TYLCSV recombinants, it has a TYLCSV derived fragment of only 76 nucleotides, and has replaced its parental viruses in natural conditions (Morocco, Souss region). The viral population shift coincided with the deployment of the popular Ty- 1 resistant tomato cultivars, and according to experimental studies, {{has been driven by}} a strong positive selection in such resistant plants. However, although Ty- 1 cultivars were extensively used in Mediterranean countries, TYLCV-IS 76 was not reported <b>outside</b> <b>Morocco.</b> This, in combination with its unusual recombination pattern suggests that it was generated through a rare and possibly multistep process. The potential generation of a recombination breakpoint (RB) at locus 76 (RB 76) was investigated over time in 10 Ty- 1 resistant and 10 nearly isogenic susceptible tomato plants co-inoculated with TYLCV and TYLCSV clones. RB 76 could not be detected in the recombinant progeny using the standard PCR/sequencing approach that was previously designed to monitor the emergence of TYLCV-IS 76 in Morocco. Using a more sensitive PCR test, RB 76 was detected in one resistant and five susceptible plants. The results are consistent with a very low intra-plant frequency of RB 76 bearing recombinants throughout the test and support the hypothesis of a rare emergence of TYLCV-IS 76. More generally, RBs were more scattered in resistant than in susceptible plants and an unusual RB at position 141 (RB 141) was positively selected in the resistant cultivar; interestingly, RB 141 bearing recombinants were detected in resistant tomato plants from the field. Scenarios of TYLCV-IS 76 pre-emergence are proposed. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} instruments of economic policy of the opened countries is the exchange rate. It is considered both a mean of monetary regulation and a tool of <b>outside</b> competitiveness. <b>Morocco</b> plans to adopt the floating exchange rate regime, in the end of 2009. Indeed, the question which arises today is to know what type of floating exchange rate regime will be applied. Under the economic, technical and institutional factors, we ask if Morocco is ready and able to adopt this regime. In the light of this report, this paper will deal with the impact of the exchange rate policy on the real economy in Morocco through an empirical model called « The Behavioural Equilibrium Exchange Rate » supported by Clark and MacDonald (1997). Firstly, our investigation deals with the efficiency of exchange rate policy adopted by Morocco, secondly, it deals with the capacity of Dirham to resist to the shocks caused by the misalignments and finely, with the Moroccan monetary authorities’ capacity to manage the existing exchange regime. Under using the cointegration method, the error correction model and the analysis of the shocks by using the method of the decomposition of variance, our results confirm that the dynamics of the exchange rate in Morocco is determined by the variables such as the terms of trade, the foreign assets and the foreign debt. Similarly, in terms of short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate and in the analysis of the shocks, the supply and demand dynamics the dirham seems determining. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore and compare the {{similarities}} and disparities between sexual harassment of students that is perpetrated by teachers and by peers. The study involved 2, 808 randomly selected adolescents at 22 secondary schools from two regions in the Netherlands. The sample comprised 14 - and 15 -year-old students (55 % girls and 45 % boys). The majority of the students' parents were born in the Netherlands (86 %); 14 % were born <b>outside</b> the Netherlands (<b>Morocco,</b> Turkey, and Surinam). The data revealed important differences between peer sexual harassment and sexual harassment perpetrated by teachers. Unwanted sexual behavior by peers is a cultural phenomenon that occurs in public areas. The relatively low incidence of unwanted sexual behavior (18 %), however, does not fully reflect the Culture Model. Sexual harassment by teachers is a particularly detrimental experience for adolescents, and health-related problems are therefore reported in higher numbers. Contrary to the assumptions of the Power Model, sexual harassment perpetrated by teachers is not incidental (27 %) and does not only occur in secluded places...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} problem of how an {{historical}} identity persists within a community in Rabat, Morocco, that traces its ancestry to Spain. Called Andalusians, these Moroccans are descended from Spanish Muslims who were first forced to convert to Christianity after 1492, and were expelled from the Iberian peninsula in the early seventeenth century. I conducted both ethnographic and historical archival research among Rabati Andalusian families. There are four main reasons for the persistence of the Andalusian identity in spite of the strong acculturative forces of religion, language, and culture in Moroccan society. First, the presence of a strong historical continuity of the Andalusian heritage in North Africa has provided a dominant history into which the exiled communities could integrate themselves. Second, the predominant practice of endogamy, as well as other social practices, reinforces an intergenerational continuity among Rabati Andalusians. Third, the Andalusian identity is a single identity that has a complex range of sociocultural contexts in which it is both meaningful and flexible. And fourth, non-Andalusian Moroccans reinforce the cultural meanings behind the importance of being Andalusian, based on the affinity most Moroccans have for the Andalusian Spanish heritage. The dissertation concludes by drawing upon comparative ethnographic material by way of testing the validity of the four reasons in contexts <b>outside</b> of <b>Morocco.</b> This thesis contributes both theoretically and ethnographically to the anthropological literature. Theoretically, it offers a general pattern to the persistence of identity while also utilizing and building onto synchronic identity studies and studies of acculturation and assimilation in anthropology by looking at the processual context of the Andalusian identity. Ethnographically, this dissertation contributes a description of a cultural group so far not represented in anthropology and also looks at a culturally elite group, a class that is under-represented in the literature. ...|$|R
40|$|Palaemon serratus {{is at the}} {{northern}} limit of its range in the British Isles. In Ireland it is most abundant in the southwest {{where it has been}} commercially fished since the mid- 1970 s. Landings in recent years have averaged between 200 and 300 tonnes annually with an estimated export value of £ 2 — 3 m. These landings represent a three-fold expansion over those of the previous decade. The biology of the species was investigated over a 12 month period in Bantry Bay using commercial gear. At most times of the year there is a bimodal length frequency distribution and the life expectancy is interpreted as 2 years. Condition factor does not vary much during the year in males and immature females but the larger females put on up to 30 % weight in the autumn. The reproductive cycle in Bantry resembles that in the south of England rather than that in north Wales, these two locations providing earlier studies of the species. The largest females come into berry in October and egg carriage within the population continues into the following summer; in May, a second group of smaller females, belonging to the 0 age group, carries eggs. Corroborative evidence for this interpretation is provided {{by the size of the}} ova and their developmental state. There would appear to be an influx of shrimp to Bantry Bay which builds up from May and declines after January but cohort and gender migrations are unclear. Catch per unit of fishing effort (cpue) is estimated from the weight of a consignment of shrimp delivered to a processor. Such data are variable but they are also consistent and stable over the short-term and throughout the range of shrimp fisheries. A time series from 1977 to 1994 suggests a 36 % decline; the significance of this is not known. Shrimp fishing takes place during the autumn and winter months. In the southeast landings are taken throughout the year but those outside the period August to January, inclusive, do not exceed 8 % of the total. In the southwest only 3 % of <b>landings</b> are made <b>outside</b> these months, while in Connemara none was reported Mechanical grading in the factory is explored as a means of reconstructing age profiles. Two patterns of exploitation are described: that of the southwest and southern coast has a larger proportion of 0 group shrimp which may reach 40 % by numbers of the total landings; in Connemara the proportion of 0 group shrimp is much smaller. Attempts are made to find some method of predicting aspects of the catch from biological and sea temperature data. There is a suggestion that a large brood year is influential in producing a successor whose size is estimated 2 years later. The sustainability of the shrimp fishery is unknown and two precautionary measures are suggested as the basis of a management regime: enlarging the mesh size to improve the exploitation pattern and limiting the fishing season.
