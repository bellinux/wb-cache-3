5|$|The European Nucleotide Archive handles <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> of data which pose a {{significant}} storage challenge. As of 2012, the ENA's storage requirements {{continue to grow}} exponentially, with a doubling time of approximately 10 months. To manage this increase, the ENA selectively discards less-valuable sequencing platform data and implements advanced compression strategies. The CRAM reference-based compression toolkit was developed to help reduce ENA storage requirements.|$|E
5|$|Although railroads {{have lost}} much of the general-freight-carrying {{business}} to semi-trailer trucks, they remain the best means of transporting <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> of such bulk commodities as coal, grain, chemicals, and ore over long distances. The development of containerization has made the railroads more effective in handling finished merchandise at relatively high speeds. In addition, the introduction of piggyback flatcars, in which truck trailers are transported long distances on specially-designed cars, has allowed railroads to regain some of the business lost to trucking.|$|E
5|$|In the laboratory, {{bacteria}} are usually grown using solid or liquid media. Solid growth media, such as agar plates, {{are used to}} isolate pure cultures of a bacterial strain. However, liquid growth media are used when measurement of growth or <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> of cells are required. Growth in stirred liquid media occurs as an even cell suspension, making the cultures easy to divide and transfer, although isolating single bacteria from liquid media is difficult. The use of selective media (media with specific nutrients added or deficient, or with antibiotics added) can help identify specific organisms.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1920s, New York's {{metropolitan}} area surpassed London's as the world's most populous {{metropolitan area}}. New York City's metropolitan area exceeded ten {{million by the}} early 1930s. The economic boom of the 1920s and the great speculation {{of the real estate}} market fostered a new wave of skyscraper projects in the city. The 1916 Zoning Resolution restricted the height that the street-side exterior walls of New York City buildings could rise before they needed to incorporate setbacks that recessed the buildings' exterior walls away from the streets. This led to the construction of Art Deco structures in New York City with significant setbacks, <b>large</b> <b>volumes,</b> and striking silhouettes that were often decorated elaborately.|$|E

5|$|Dana's {{work was}} {{followed}} up by geologist C. E. Dutton's 1884 expedition, who refined and expanded Dana's ideas. Most notably, Dutton {{established that the}} island of Hawaii actually harbored five volcanoes, whereas Dana counted three. This is because Dana had originally regarded Kīlauea as a flank vent of Mauna Loa, and Kohala as part of Mauna Kea. Dutton also refined others of Dana's observations, and is credited with the naming of 'a'ā and pāhoehoe-type lavas, although Dana had noted a distinction. Stimulated by Dutton's expedition, Dana returned in 1887, and published many accounts of his expedition in the American Journal of Science. In 1890 he published the most detailed manuscript of its day, and remained the definitive guide to Hawaiian volcanism for decades. 1909 saw the publication of two <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> which extensively quoted from earlier works now out of circulation.|$|E

His works, composed {{over a period of}} nearly sixty years, eschew traditional forms. In addition to electronic music—both with and without live performers—they range from miniatures for musical boxes through works for solo instruments, songs, chamber music, choral and orchestral music, to a cycle of seven full-length operas. His theoretical and other writings comprise ten <b>large</b> <b>volumes.</b> He received numerous prizes and distinctions for his compositions, recordings, and for the scores produced by his publishing company.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the Norwegian National Rail Administration {{warned that}} lack of funding {{might lead to a}} closure of all long-distance {{passenger}} trains in Norway, including the Bergen Line. Torild Skogsholm, Minister of Transport and Communications assured that it was not the government's policy to close railway lines. In 2004 the Progress Party suggested closing down the railway line and replacing it with a motorway between Bergen and Oslo, arguing that the railway was unprofitable, and that bus transport was cheaper while easier truck transport would aid business. Other political parties rejected the proposal pointing out the better environmental performance of the railway and that the railway transports <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> of freight.|$|E

5|$|Mathilde is very dark, with an albedo {{comparable}} to fresh asphalt, and {{is thought to}} share the same composition as CI1 or CM2 carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, with a surface dominated by phyllosilicate minerals. The asteroid {{has a number of}} extremely large craters, with the individual craters being named for coal fields and basins around the world. The two largest craters, Ishikari (29.3km) and Karoo (33.4km), are as wide as the asteroid's average radius. The impacts appear to have spalled <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> off the asteroid, as suggested by the angular edges of the craters. No differences in brightness or colour were visible in the craters and there was no appearance of layering, so the asteroid's interior must be very homogeneous. There are indications of material movement along the downslope direction.|$|E
5|$|Shield volcanoes undergo {{at least}} two stages of {{volcanic}} activity. The initial shield stage is the most productive volcanically and features repeated eruptions of <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> of predominately fluid peralkaline felsic magmas that become progressively more evolved. During this stage, a small summit caldera may form, {{as is the case}} for the Ilgachuz Range. After the shield stage has been completed, the post-shield stage succeeds. This stage of activity is characterized by small volumes of more mafic lavas expressed as small cinder cones and capping flows. Dissection of the shield by stream erosion is also apparent, resulting in the creation of deeply incised radial valleys.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the volcanoes' magma has changed significantly with time as they grow over the hotspot and migrate away. Volcanic activity 14.5to 3.0million years ago was predominately felsic, producing <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> of rhyolite and trachyte lava. This {{can be explained by}} the presence of thick granitic structures under these volcanoes, which have been tectonically compressed from being near the North American Plate margin. A unique characteristic of the felsic lava flows is that although they were high in silica content, the flows were overly fluid in nature. This is because the peralkaline content of these felsic lavas decreased the viscosity of the flows a minimum of 10–30times over that of calc-alkaline felsic flows. Evidence for explosive volcanism exists in the form of pumice flows, bedded tuffs, intensely shattered basement rocks and the high content of coarse basement clasts in rhyolite breccias.|$|E

The quality of the water is generally good, and the river is measured at four gauging stations, three on the main channel, and one of the River Lod, just before its junction with the Rother. Water from the underlying Lower Greensand aquifer and the adjacent chalk aquifer helps to maintain the flows during the summer months, despite the fact that <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> are abstracted from both the aquifers and the river for the public water supply.|$|E
5|$|The simple, low-crowned teeth {{indicate}} that Paraceratherium was a browser with a diet consisting of relatively soft leaves and shrubs. Later rhinoceroses were grazers, with high-crowned teeth because their diets contained grit that quickly wore down their teeth. Studies of mesowear on Paraceratherium teeth confirm the creatures {{had a soft}} diet of leaves; microwear studies {{have yet to be}} conducted. Isotope analysis shows that Paraceratherium fed chiefly on C3 plants, which are mainly leaves. Like its perissodactyl relatives, the horses, tapirs, and other rhinoceroses, Paraceratherium would have been a hindgut fermenter; it would extract relatively little nutrition from its food and would have to eat <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> to survive.

5|$|Triceratops {{teeth were}} {{arranged}} in groups called batteries, of 36 to 40 tooth columns, in {{each side of}} each jaw with 3 to 5 stacked teeth per column, {{depending on the size}} of the animal. This gives a range of 432 to 800 teeth, of which only a fraction were in use at any given time (tooth replacement was continuous and occurred throughout the life of the animal). They functioned by shearing in a vertical to near-vertical orientation. The great size and numerous teeth of Triceratops suggests that they ate <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> of fibrous plant material, with some suggesting palms and cycads, and others suggesting ferns, which then grew in prairies.|$|E
5|$|Early {{freight traffic}} {{consisted}} of agricultural products, including carrots, celery, clover, peas, potatoes, sugar beet and swedes, together with <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> of peat from Swinefleet Works near Reedness Junction and from Hatfield Works on the Hatfield Moor Branch. Traffic {{into the area}} included manure. In the 1920s, stations notified the control centre at Goole {{of the number of}} wagons they would need for consignments of peas and potatoes, and could also request additional trains. 4,000 tons of green peas were despatched during the 1926 growing season, and in the following year, 7,000 bundles of celery left Epworth station in a three-day period. Traffic started to decline in the 1930s, as motor lorries began {{to take some of the}} trade. By 1937, there were only three workings each day, and those were run if required. The peat works at Hatfield was still supplying an average of six wagon-loads per day.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius alnicola is an ectomycorrhizal species, and {{engages in}} a mutualistic {{association}} with certain plant species. In this association, the hyphae of the fungus permeate <b>large</b> <b>volumes</b> {{of soil and}} obtain scarce elements, especially phosphorus—which is often limiting for plant growth—which they pass on to the plant in exchange for metabolic products of the plant's photosynthesis. The ectomycorrhizae that the fungus forms in association with Picea engelmannii {{have been shown to}} contain lactifers (latex-producing cells) and pigments similar to the fruit body. Fruit bodies of the fungus grow in groups on the ground under alders and conifers, usually appearing between July and October. It is a fairly common species in the western United States and Baja California. Additional collection locations in Mexico include Veracruz, Villarreal, and Tapia. A population in central and southern California is known to associate with oak trees. In the Rocky Mountains it is associated with the subalpine tree species Englemann Spruce (Picea engelmannii), while at lower elevations it is commonly found with white spruce (Picea glauca). It is also known to associate with Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (genus Pseudotsuga). The mushroom has also been collected from Bageshwar, in the state of Uttarakhand, India.|$|E
