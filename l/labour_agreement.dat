5|$|Stelmach's premiership {{was heavily}} focused on {{management}} of the province's oil reserves, especially those of the Athabasca Oil Sands. He rejected calls from environmentalists to slow the pace of development in the Fort McMurray area, and similarly opposed calls for carbon taxes. Other policy initiatives included commencing {{an overhaul of the}} province's health governance system, amendments to the Alberta human rights code, a re-introduction of all-party committees to the Legislature, and the conclusion of a major <b>labour</b> <b>agreement</b> with Alberta's teachers. His government also attracted controversy for awarding itself a 30% pay increase shortly after its re-election, and featured strained relations with Calgary, one of Klein's former strongholds. Despite this, Stelmach increased the Progressive Conservatives' already substantial majority in the 2008 election. With the advent of the late-2000s recession, Stelmach had to cope with a deteriorating economic situation and the Alberta government's first budget deficit in 16 years.|$|E

40|$|The {{level of}} {{protection}} against social risks that is organised in a welfare state is not only dependent upon the arrangements {{of the welfare state}} itself, but also, as {{we have seen in the}} previous chapter, on arrangements organised in firms or in collective bargaining. The previous chapter investigated the introduction of the idea of employability as a strategy to enhance job security and concluded that the collective bargaining process facilitated the introduction and relative success of this strategy in collective <b>labour</b> <b>agreements</b> and in the labour policies of firms. This was explained by the institutional complementarity that exists in the Dutch corporatist welfare state between the norm of job security and the normative ideals of the strategy of enhancing employability. In this chapter, we focus on the corporatist institution of collective bargaining that is so important to Dutch labour policy and investigate the role this institution plays in risk management and the contribution it makes to the protection against old and new social risks. In this chapter, we investigate the interaction between risk protection by the welfare state and provisions in collective <b>labour</b> <b>agreements.</b> If one diminishes, how does the other react? We investigate this interaction in relation to welfare state retrenchment (is this compensated for in collective <b>labour</b> <b>agreements?),</b> in relation to old and new social risks (to what extent do collective <b>labour</b> <b>agreements</b> and the traditional institution of social security protect against new social risks?) and in relation to the decentralisation of collective <b>labour</b> <b>agreements</b> (does decentralisation lead to a decrease in risk-protection?). We learn that, as was the case in the previous chapter, the ‘old’ institutions of the (corporatist) welfare state play a decisive role in the birth of a ‘new welfare settlement’...|$|R

50|$|In Finland, {{there is}} {{universal}} validity of collective <b>labour</b> <b>agreements.</b> This {{means that a}} collective agreement in an economic sector becomes a universally applicable legal minimum for any individual’s employment contract, union member or not.

50|$|The labor {{agreements}} also pose {{significant political}} questions. Bargaining is highly centralized {{and often the}} government participates to coordinate fiscal policy.

40|$|The Dutch {{system of}} {{employment}} protection is often perceived as too strict for workers on permanent contracts, {{because of the}} large procedural inconveniences, difficulty of dismissal and high severance pay. It is suggested that the system of employment protection lowers labour market flexibility by lowering hiring and firing rates, and increasing the employers’ labour costs. Many parties (e. g. government, employers and trade unions) have opted for reforms of the system in recent years. One of the proposed scenarios is to allow for more differentiation by decentralising employment protection, e. g. regulations in individual or collective <b>labour</b> <b>agreements.</b> At present, however, it is already possible to regulate employment protection on a decentralised level, i. e. in collective <b>labour</b> <b>agreements</b> on a sector or company level. Dutch national labour law is only ¾ binding, implying that deviations are allowed for in collective <b>labour</b> <b>agreements.</b> Yet, most research on employment protection is on the national provisions and disregards this sector level differentiation. With this study we contribute to the literature by investigating employment protection provisions on a sector level. The level of employment protection on the sector level not only depends on the national level of employment protection, the system of unemployment insurance, but also of union power and collective bargaining strategies pursued by the trade unions. Employment protection provisions might be used as a trading good in collective bargaining, i. e. there might be a trade off with other provisions such as bargained wage development or extra-statutory unemployment insurance. This might lead to sector differences in the level of employment protection found in collective <b>labour</b> <b>agreements.</b> In addition, employment protection affects labour market performance. Hiring and firing rates are expected to be lower at higher levels of employment protection, and the use of temporary contracts as an alternative to regular workers is expected to be higher. To analyse the collective <b>labour</b> <b>agreements,</b> we use the FNV CLA databank and for the analysis of labour market dynamics, we use the online databank of Statistics Netherlands. Our study shows that sector level provisions on employment protection are at or above the national level, which is related to union density. The higher levels of employment protection seem to come at a cost for employers who have higher labour costs, both non-wage and wage costs. Consequently, hiring and firing are indeed lower at higher levels of employment protection. The use of temporary contracts, however, is not higher at higher levels of employment protection, but the opposite is observed. These findings can have important policy implications, especially with respect to the debate in shifting responsibilities, in general but particularly with respect to employment protection regulation, to the sector level. ...|$|R
