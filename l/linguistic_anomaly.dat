40|$|In one {{normative}} and one {{eye tracking}} experiment, we investigated {{the relationship between}} eye movements and <b>linguistic</b> <b>anomaly</b> detection. We manipulated semantic congruency and two types of syntactic congruency in unambiguous sentences. The three types of manipulations produced different patterns of effects in the first pass measures in the anomalous region. Syntactic congruency affected first pass reading time when the manipulation involved a phrasal category error (substituting a noun phrase for a prepositional phrase), but not when it involved a morphological feature error (subject-verb agreement). Both types of syntactic congruency influenced {{the likelihood of a}} first pass regressive eye movement. Semantic congruency did not influence first pass reading time, but it did affect the regression path duration. These findings support a model of language comprehension that marks some distinctions among the construction of syntactic structure, morphological feature-checking, and semantic processing. Furthermore, our findings suggest that we may need to reassess some garden path effects in the literature...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} extent to which rules or {{conventions}} of a language are "broken" in print advertising. A lot of the text that is used in advertising does not adhere to some norms that are conventionally adhered to in natural language. Research from how we learn language suggests that there are rules inherent to language that we obey. In using language, we are expected to obey these rules in order to maintain order and clarity, and to avoid wordiness and ambiguity, for example. However, despite their infringements on these rules of natural language, advertisements are still readable, coherent and cohesive and can still be comprehended. My thesis determines which linguistic rules are violated and which are not and thus ascertains the role of such rule-breaking in advertising language. It also arrives at a conclusion as to how this rule-breaking is a tool that the advertisers use to make the product more attractive and to make the advertisement more effective. In order to do this, this paper examines a range of advertisements in French and English, from different genres of magazines. The advertisements selected for discussion here are from a broader pool and were the ones that best illustrate a specific <b>linguistic</b> <b>anomaly</b> I wish to explore in detail. I have also made reference to some of the articles that I studied and that dealt with specific aspects of rule-violation in advertising language. I have classified and divided my information according to the type of anomaly that I have found, namely those that pertain to reference, semantic roles, syntax, pragmatics and morphology. These are explored in the sections numbered 2. 0 through 6. 0. Within each section; I present examples of my data that display irregularities, and discuss, with reference to natural language, what it is that constitutes an irregularity in each case. Then I explain why it is that these specific linguistic irregularities are carried out in advertising and how they are actually used to lead the readers directly back to the product. After my reference page, I have included an appendix which has pictures {{of a lot of the}} advertisements that I discussed here...|$|E
40|$|Two ERP {{components}} {{are discussed in}} relation to studies of semantic and mnemonic processing, namely the N 400 and LPC. The N 400 is a monophasic negativity typically observed between 250 - 500 ms post-stimulus. Semantic and repetition priming studies utilising linguistic stimuli in the visual modality (i. e. words, nonwords), and stimulus paradigms (i. e. sentence priming and lexical decision tasks) have indicated that the N 400 is readily evoked by semantic anomaly and is sensitive to word frequency (low frequency words eliciting greater amplitude N 400 s than high frequency words), word class (larger N 400 s to content words), semantic relatedness (larger N 400 s to unrelated words), subject expectancy (larger N 400 s to unexpected words within a context), phonology (larger N 400 s to non-rhyming words and nonwords), and repetition (attenuated N 400 s following word repetition). Theoretical formulations suggest the N 400 indexes the degree of spreading activation throughout the semantic network (Morton, 1969), contextual integration (Rugg, 1990), semantic expectancy (Kutas & Hillyard, 1984), or a memory search process (Bentin & McCarthy, 1994). Which of these formulations most accurately explains the N 400 is currently unresolved. Whether the negativity observed following semantic anomaly in paradigms employing nonlinguistic stimuli (e. g. pictures, faces, and music) is reflecting the same process as the N 400 elicited by <b>linguistic</b> <b>anomaly,</b> is also the subject of considerable debate. Enhanced LPC amplitudes in language tasks are typically recorded to sentence final words. The broad, post N 400 positivity, occurs approximately 550 - 800 ms post-stimulus and is presumed to reflect processes associated with closure (Friedman, Simson, Ritter, & Rapin, 1975; Kutas & Hillyard, 1982), certainty (Stuss, Picton, Cerri, Leech, & Stethem, 1992), and integrative elaborative processing (Andrews, Mitchell, & Ward, 1993). All task relevant stimuli appear to elicit the LPC, its amplitude being inversely related to subjective probability. The LPC is also associated with certain aspects of mnemonic processing. Enhanced LPC amplitudes have been recorded to stimuli which are subsequently recognised, to 'seen' stimuli as compared to 'unseen', and to the second presentations of stimuli. Subsequent to these findings, {{it has been hypothesised}} that the LPC observed in memory and repetition paradigms reflects some process associated with both encoding and retrieval. Resulting from the perceived similarity between the LPC component elicited in these various paradigms, some investigators posit that similar episodic processes subserve them (Besson & Kutas, 1993) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Far {{from being}} <b>linguistic</b> <b>anomalies,</b> multi-word {{expressions}} abound in natural language, yet their identification is surprisingly problematic. The same combination of words can {{occur as a}} compositional, fully lexical string or as a delexicalised multi-word unit (MWU). How can these different manifestations {{of a series of}} words be distinguished one from the other? To exacerbate the problem, the creativity of language users results in the appearance of non-canonical forms of MWUs. How can these innovative uses be retrieved {{so that they can be}} incorporated into a comprehensive analysis of the MWU under study? This paper sets forth procedures for retrieving non-canonical variants from large general reference corpora, and addresses the disambiguation of compositional and non-compositional multi-word strings from a collocational standpoint...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{linguistic}} ontext in positively thought-disordered (TD) schizophrenics was investigated through examination f their performance onan on-line word-monitoring task. Controls and non-TD schizophrenics took longer to recognize words preceded by <b>linguistic</b> <b>anomalies</b> compared with words in normal sentences. Compared with both other groups, TD schizophrenics showed signifi-cantly smaller differences in reaction time, suggesting that hey were relatively insensitive to linguistic violations. TD schizophrenics were also less sensitive to linguistic violations in an off-line {{version of the}} task, in which they judged whether the sentences "made sense. " Finally, these participants produced more errors on a verbal fluency task than did non-TD schizophrenics or normal controls. These {{findings are consistent with}} the theory that schizophrenic thought disorder arises from a deficit in the use {{of linguistic}} ontext to process and produce speech. Disorder of the form of thought characterized by "loosening of associations " (Bleuler, 1911 / 1950) has long been considered a core feature of schizophrenia, nd there have been numerous attempts to pinpoint its underlying basis. Some authors have tried to link symptoms and cognitive functions conceptuall...|$|R
40|$|This {{study used}} {{magnetoencephalography}} (MEG) to investigate which brain areas four-year old children activate to process grammatical anomalies. Using MEG, {{we were able}} to localise brain areas involved in semantic and syntactic integration processes in the brain of normally developing children. Subjects: we report data from 19 English-speaking, righthanded, 4 year olds (mean age= 53 months, S. D. = 3 months). Children listened to spoken sentences. To ensure children were paying attention to the stimuli, their task was to repeat a catch phrase contained in filler. Neuromagnetic fields were recorded with a child-sized whole-head, 64 -channel axial gradiometer MEG system (KIT/Yokogawa, Japan) at the KIT-Macquarie Brain Research Lab (Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia). To identify neural generators, we used the distributed inverse method LORETA (BESA 5. 3). Our region-of-interest analysis revealed a significant larger response of the posterior superior temporal lobe between 380 to 530 ms bilaterally to ungrammatical contexts. In comparison to analogous studies with adults, we found that children's brains activate a similar network while processing <b>linguistic</b> <b>anomalies.</b> Our results provide evidence in favor automatic semantic and syntactic processes to be in place earlier that predicted by constructivist views of language development. 1 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The present {{experiment}} investigated cortical {{responses of}} native Italian subjects during reading of short sentences including semantic or morphosyntactic violations. Given {{the specificity of}} the Italian language in which the sequencing of words is relatively more free than in English or other languages, we investigated whether syntactic and semantic violations were able to elicit event-related potential (ERP) components {{similar to those found}} in other languages. Cortical potentials evoked by the anomalous target word were recorded at frontal, central and parietal electrodes. Results showed that, in Italian, semantic anomaly elicited a negative wave (N 400) in the 400 - 500 ms time-window and syntactic error evoked a slower positive wave (P 600) in the 500 - 700 ms time-window. Syntactic error also evoked a significant left anterior negativity in the 350 - 450 ms time-window, supporting the view that syntactic processes precedes semantic analysis. Thus, Italian language, notwithstanding its specificity, shows ERPs responses to semantic and syntactic violations, with effects, scalp distribution and latency similar to those found in German, Dutch and English. Results point to a cross-linguistic consistency of the semantic and syntactic ERP components associated with the detection of <b>linguistic</b> <b>anomalies...</b>|$|R

Coulson et al. concluded that these responses are highly similar, whereas Osterhout et al. concluded that they are distinct. In this comment, we evaluate the relative merits of these claims. We conclude that the available evidence indicates that the ERP response to syntactic anomalies is at least partially distinct from the ERP response to unexpected anomalies that do not involve a grammatical violation...|$|R
