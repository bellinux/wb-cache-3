5000|$|Teaching University: {{including}} the “Regional Universities” has a {{primary focus of}} teaching and a “responsibility for institutional and applied research...” Institutional research is the minimum a university professor needs to do assure they are constantly imparting the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> to students. Applied research is using {{some part of the}} profession’s accumulated theories, knowledge, methods, and techniques, for a specific, often for governmental, commercial, or client driven purpose. A professor at a teaching university usually has a terminal degree (but may have a master's degree) and has a primary focus on teaching. In Oklahoma, at least ½ of a professor’s time must be spent performing teaching related activities in order to be considered full-time faculty. Applied and Institutional Research is typically funded through budgets and allocated through “release time” - obtaining an adjunct (or part-time instructor) to cover the professor's teaching requirements that are re-allocated to research. A teaching university focuses on Bachelor’s and master's degrees, although a few institutions may offer highly specialized terminal professional degrees. An undergraduate student at a Teaching University will typically be taught by a professor (as opposed to a graduate assistant) and have smaller class sizes than a typical undergraduate student at a Research University.|$|E
5000|$|In a 1973 Modern Age journal article, Thompson {{summarized}} {{his theories}} about collegiate professorship with the challenging notions of, “It {{is the business}} of the college professor to interpret his discipline to the learner in terms of the learner’s awareness.”and his philosophical direction of,“In the realm <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> there is only one test. That test is more knowledge. This is the case because all <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> fact and existence is conditional. The <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> our <b>knowledge</b> is always problematic. The criterion <b>of</b> more <b>knowledge</b> is the only alternative I know to authoritarian dogma.”He went on to emphasize the role of the professorship in protecting the discipline as,“We need always to remember, however, and to remind those who forget, that our role is a mediating one. The civilizers of men are the disciplines which are in our care, and in our care alone. Our task is to build roads of access to these disciplines for each new generation. The constant concern of each of us must be to protect the integrity of his discipline from any who would pollute it to satisfy the enemies <b>of</b> <b>knowledge,</b> or dilute it for the sake of popularity, or cheapen it to titillate the vulgar.” ...|$|R

Lincoln University {{has been involved with}} this leaders programme since 1979 when it was launched with a grant from the Kellogg Foundation, USA. This Report aims to analyse the "on farm" costs and returns of a Proposed Irrigation Development in Mid Canterbury. The Land and Area is recognised as being suitable for irrigation development. Two detailed On Farm Development Programmes are cash flowed over a three-year programme using a case study property of 200 hectares (total). These Financial Projections are compared with the status quo as well as some other alternatives (being the purchase of additional dryland plus the effect of converting the irrigated land to dairy). Mid Canterbury {{has a long history of}} irrigation dating back to the 1930 's when the Rangitata Diversion Race (RDR) was first formed. The Irrigation Development, which has stemmed from the RDR plus the use of underground wells puts Mid Canterbury at the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> irrigation <b>knowledge</b> for New Zealand. There is a proven infrastructure for irrigation development plus an excellent <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> how farmers can use irrigation as a profitable economic tool. There is a trust between farmers and irrigation scheme administrators. As well there is a trust of irrigation from the financial institutions...|$|R
40|$|Innovative {{designs of}} {{transport}} vehicles {{need to be}} validated in order to demonstrate reliability and provide confidence. The most common approaches to such designs involve simulations based on Finite Element (FE) analysis, used to study the mechanical response of the structural elements during critical events. These simulations need reliable validation techniques, especially if anisotropic materials, such as fibre reinforced polymers, or complex designs, such as automotive components are considered. It is normal practice to assess the accuracy of numerical results by comparing the predicted values to corresponding experimental data. In this frame, the use of whole field optical techniques has been proven successful in the validation of deformation, strain, or vibration modes [1]. The strength of full-field optical techniques is that the whole displacement field can be visualized and analyzed. By using High Speed cameras, the Digital Image Correlation (DIC) method {{can be applied to}} highly non-linear dynamic events and deliver quantitative information about the three-dimensional displacement field [2]. The objective of the present paper is to integrate full-field optical measurement methodologies with state-of-the-art computational simulation techniques for non-linear transient dynamic events, in order to improve both methods. Whilst the impact of homogeneous panels is a relatively straightforward task, the simulation of impact and subsequent development of damage in a composite panel is probably at the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> current <b>knowledge.</b> In this frame, flat rectangular composite plates of dimensions 0. 2 x 0. 1 m, as well as, a car bonnet frame structure of dimensions about 1. 8 x 0. 8 m, shown in Fig. 1 a and Fig. 2 a, respectively, are considered. Both structures have been manufactured of PolyPropylene (PP) and PolyAmide (PA) glass fiber reinforced thermoplastic materials. Aiming to assess the panels and bonnet energy absorbing capability, they have been tested in hard-body low velocity, low energy, mass-drop impact loading, in a drop-tower, with impact energies ranging from 20. J to 200 J. In parallel, simulation models of the plates and the car bonnet frame have been developed, as shown in Fig. 1 b and 2 b. Both structures are modelled using layered shell elements. A node-to-surface contact definition is introduced for modelling the physical contact of the impactor to the bonnet. A High Speed Image Correlation system [3] was used to record full field optical measurement data, which were used to correlate experimentally recorded and numerically calculated displacement / strain histories at various points of the structures and different time intervals o the event. In such a way, experimental validation of simulations of the dynamic event of the flat plates and the car bonnet frame, by using full-field optical methods of deformation measurement were performed. Comparisons are based on both ‘point-to-point’ comparisons of displacement and strain data, as well as comparison of displacement or strain snapshot plots at certain time intervals of the dynamic event, based on an image ‘shape descriptor’ approach...|$|R
