While modern Quantum cascade lasers have evolved as ideal coherent mid-IR excitation sources, simple, <b>low</b> <b>noise,</b> <b>room</b> temperature detectors and imaging systems still lag behind.

40|$|Nonlinear silicon {{photonics}} {{has been}} an immense research subject {{in the past several}} years with promising prospects of delivering chip scale signal modulation, shaping and characterization tools. In particular, broadband parametric process has been considered for applications ranging from wideband light amplifiers to signal characterization and signal shaping tools. Although underlying nonlinear effect, Kerr phenomena, in silicon has generated promising result of wavelength conversion, the success of these devices have been challenged by the presence of nonlinear losses such as two photon absorption and the two photon generated free carrier absorption. Experimental demonstrations were limited to conversion efficiencies below - 10 dB. Here, we present the prospect of ultra wide discrete band conversion schemes and the prospect of parametric process at mid-infrared wavelengths where nonlinear losses are not present. In particular, we explore the parametric wavelength conversion scheme at mid-wave infrared wavelength (2 μm~ 6 μm) by four-wavefixing process in silicon waveguides with new cladding materials, such as sapphire, that can provide transparency up to 6 μm and facilitate phase matching condition for discrete wavelength bands as far as 60 THz away from each other. Design criteria include the optimization of mode overlap integrals and dispersion engineering for an ultra-wide band signals. The particular results of wavelength conversion between 2 μm bands and 5 μm bands, and between 1. 8 μm bands and > 4 μm bands will be presented. Prospects of frequency band conversion in generation of new infrared signals and <b>low</b> <b>noise,</b> <b>room</b> temperature detection of mid-infrared signals will also be discussed...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a frequency stabilized diode laser at 698 nm used for high resolution spectroscopy of the 1 S 0 - 3 P 0 strontium clock transition.

Our dedicated fiber link ensures a transfer of the optical carrier with frequency stability of 7 · 10 ^- 18 after 100 s integration time, which could enable the observation of the strontium clock transition with an atomic Q of 10 ^ 14.

40|$|Dielectric {{resonators}} are {{key components}} for many microwave and millimetre wave applications, including high-Q filters and frequency-determining elements for precision frequency synthesis. These often {{depend on the}} quality of the dielectric material. The commonly used material for building the best cryogenic microwave oscillators is sapphire. However sapphire is becoming a limiting factor for higher frequencies design. It is then important to find new candidates that can fulfil the requirements for millimetre wave <b>low</b> <b>noise</b> oscillators at <b>room</b> and cryogenic temperatures. These clocks are used as a reference in many fields, like modern telecommunication systems, radio astronomy (VLBI), and precision measurements at the quantum limit. High-resolution measurements were made of the temperature-dependence of the electromagnetic properties of a polycrystalline diamond disk at temperatures between 35 K and 330 K at microwave to sub-millimetre wave frequencies. The cryogenic measurements were made using a TE 01 δ dielectric mode resonator placed inside a vacuum chamber connected to a single-stage pulse-tube cryocooler. The high frequency characterization was performed at room temperature using a combination of a quasi-optical two-lens transmission setup, a Fabry-Perot cavity and a whispering gallery mode resonator excited with waveguides. Our CVD diamond sample exhibits a decreasing loss tangent with increasing frequencies. We compare the results with well known crystals. This comparison makes clear that polycrystalline diamond could be an important material to generate stable frequencies at millimetre waves. Comment: 6 pages, 7 figures, 1 table, journal articl...|$|R

40|$|<b>Low</b> <b>noise</b> {{amplifiers}} {{are classified}} into two categories: Wideband <b>low</b> <b>noise</b> amplifiers and Narrowband <b>low</b> <b>noise</b> amplifiers.

40|$|Thermodynamical {{fluctuations}} in temperature and position exist in every physical system, and {{show up as}} a fundamental noise limit whenever we choose to measure some quantity in a laboratory environment. Thermodynamical {{fluctuations in}} the position of the atoms in the dielectric coatings on the mirrors for optical cavities at the forefront of precision metrology (e. g., LIGO, the cavities which probe atomic transitions to define the second) are a current limiting noise source for these experiments, and anything which involves locking a laser to an optical cavity. These thermodynamic noise sources scale physical geometry of experiment, material properties (such as mechanical loss in our dielectric coatings), and temperature. The temperature scaling provides a natural motivation to move to lower temperatures, with a potential huge benefit for redesigning a room temperature experiment which is limited by thermal noise for cryogenic operation. We design, build, and characterize a pair of linear Fabry-Perot cavities to explore limitations to ultra <b>low</b> <b>noise</b> laser stabilization experiments at cryogenic temperatures. We use silicon as the primary material for the cavity and mirrors, due to a zero crossing in its linear coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) at 123 K, and other desirable material properties. We use silica tantala coatings, which are currently the best for making high finesse <b>low</b> <b>noise</b> cavities at <b>room</b> temperature. The material properties of these coating materials (which set the thermal noise levels) are relatively unknown at cryogenic temperatures, which motivates us to study them at these temperatures. We were not able to measure any thermal noise source with our experiment due to excess noise. In this work we analyze the design and performance of the cavities, and recommend a design shift from mid length cavities to short cavities in order to facilitate a direct measurement of cryogenic coating noise. In addition, we measure the cavities (frequency dependent) photo-thermal response. This can help characterize thermooptic noise in the coatings, which is poorly understood at cryogenic temperatures. We also explore the feasibility of using the cavity to do macroscopic quantum optomechanics such as ground state cooling. </p...|$|R
