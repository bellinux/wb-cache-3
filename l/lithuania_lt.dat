We conducted the first clinical and molecular study on this virus in Latvia (LV) and <b>Lithuania</b> (<b>LT).</b> The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the occurrence of HBoV 1 in respiratory tract samples taken from hospitalised children with acute respiratory tract infections in LV and LT. In total 186 children with age one to 50 months, and who fulfilled criteria of acute respiratory tract infection, including lower respiratory tract infections, with or without fever, were included in this study. A nasopharyngeal aspirate was obtained from each patient on admission. DNA was isolated and polimerase chain reaction (PCR) performed targeting the HBoV 1 NS 1 sequence. HBoV 1 positive samples were sequenced and phylogenetic analysis was performed. HBoV 1 sequence was detected in 42 (32 %) of 130 LV and in 8 (14 %) of 56 LT samples. In LV the majority of patients with HBoV 1 infection were observed in February while in LT in October. The phylogenetic tree for HBoV 1 indicated that isolates of HBoV 1 cluster closely and include almost all of the isolates in this study. HBoV 1 is common in Latvia and Lithuania and might be a significant pathogen that contributes to acute respiratory tract infections in children...|$|E

40|$|The use of live {{bacterial}} {{cultures in the}} animal industry, whether to improve resistance to specific pathogens or to non-specifically enhance animal health, improves production parameters (Kenny et al., 2011). Different lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains belonging to similar species have different properties and so effects/benefits can be different from one strain to another within the same species (Fukushima et al., 2011). The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the influence of Lactobacillus sakei multiplied in extruded rye substrate on dairy cows rumen fluid parameters, milk yield and milk composition. Extruded rye wholemeal (moisture content 8. 6 %) produced by a single-screw extruder (Ustukiu malunas <b>Ltd,</b> <b>Lithuania)</b> was used as the fermentation medium for LAB multiplication. The fermented extruded rye (65 % moisture content) has been prepared by using 30 kg of extruded rye whole meal fluor and 45 L of water. LAB cell suspension (600 mL) containing about 1011 cfu/mL was added, followed by fermentation for 24 h at 30 ŗC temperature. The final cfu/g in the fermented product was on average 109 cfu/g. The experiment was performed in the winter at the farm of Black & White Holstein dairy cattle. Trial and control groups received identical diets, however the trial group received also 100 g of fermented rye flour (containing 109 cfu/g of LAB) per head of the supplement (daily, during 65 days). Results showed, that ruminant pH, total and individual FFA, total N and NH₃-N, D(-) lactate, reduction activity of bacteria, glucose fermentation reaction, protozoa number, TLC and TCE in trial group had no significant difference (P> 0. 05) from those characteristics in control group and in trial group at the beginning of the experiment, but L(+) lactate and TCM were different.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to assess discrepancies between estimated peer and personal drinking behavior and to determine associations between perceptions of peer and personal drinking behavior among university students from Hungary (HU), <b>Lithuania</b> (<b>LT),</b> and the Slovak Republic (SK). Methods: 2, 554 freshman university students completed an online questionnaire on the frequency of their personal alcohol use, the number of heavy drinking occasions and on their perception concerning the corresponding drinking behavior of a typical student. Associations between perceived peer and personal use were analyzed by means of logistic regression, adjusting for sex. Results: The majority of students across all countries thought their peers drink more frequently and are more often involved in heavy drinking occasions than themselves. Students who perceived the frequency of peer alcohol use to be higher were more likely to drink alcohol twice a week or more often (SR: OR = 3. 81, 95 % CI = 2. 51 – 5. 79; LT: OR = 3. 16, 95 % CI = 2. 11 – 4. 75; HU: OR = 2. 10, 95 % CI = 1. 53 – 2. 87) compared with students who drink alcohol monthly or less. Those who perceived the number of peer heavy drinking occasions as high {{were more likely to report}} heavy drinking weekly or more often (SR: OR = 3. 16, 95 % CI = 1. 92 – 5. 20; LT:OR = 3. 56, 95 % CI = 2. 14 – 5. 94; HU:OR = 1. 41, 95 % CI = 0. 79 – 2. 51) compared with students who report heavy drinking less than monthly. Conclusions/Importance: University students perceived peer alcohol use to be higher than their personal use. Given the association between perceptions and personal alcohol use, future research should investigate if targeting perceptions in the surveyed countries may have an impact on alcohol use...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the {{prevalence}} and severity of precancerous condition – gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia (IM) between Eastern European (Lithuania and Latvia) and Asian (Taiwan) countries in population older than 55 years. Methods. Patients aged 55 years and older, referred for upper endoscopy due to dyspeptic symptoms, were included in the study. Gastric biopsies were histological investigated according modified Sydney classification. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) was detected if any two of three methods (urease test, histology, and serology) were positive. Results. Overall 322 patients included: 52 from Taiwan (TW), 171 from Latvia (LV) and 99 from <b>Lithuania</b> (<b>LT).</b> There were 227 (70 %) females and 95 (30 %) males. The mean age of TW patients was significantly lower (61. 0 ± 5. 8 years), than of LV (68. 1 ± 7. 3 years) and LT (66. 5 ± 7. 5 years) patients. H. pylori was established in 224 (69. 6 %) patients. H. pylori positivity was established in 43 (82. 7 %) TW patients, in 112 (65. 5 %) LV patients, and in 69 (69. 7 %) LT patients (P> 0. 05). In H. pylori-infected patients, any atrophy either in the corpus or in the antrum of the stomach was detected in 26 (60. 5 %) TW patients, in 40 (35. 7 %) LV patients, and in 36 (52. 2 %) LT patients (between TW and LV patients P 0. 05). Intestinal metaplasia was detected in 22 (51. 2 %) TW patients, in 37 (33. 0 %) LV patients and in 31 (44. 9 %) LT patients among countries (P> 0. 05). There were no significant differences in proportions of different degrees of both atrophy and intestinal metaplasia among countries. Intestinal metaplasia was found in 79 (77. 5 %) of 102 patients with any degree of atrophy and in 11 (9. 0 %) of 122 patients without atrophy (P 0, 05.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to add to the genealogical {{structure}} of breeding Black and White cattle, to analyse their productivity and other profitable features of farms by methods of genetic statistics. The Results of Survey. The first line of Black and White bulls in <b>Lithuania</b> were Plessas <b>LT</b> 149, Gulbių Riteris LT 277, Olaf LT 276, Hanmaksas LT 1200, Kraft-Stipruolis LT 1201, Garsas LT 200 and etc. In Lithuania a new period of creation and breeding of Black and White genealogical structure started when Black and White cattle from Holland were used en masse in order to improve the cattle breed. The best Black and White bulls from Holland were chosen as initials. Those breeds were: Annas Adema 30587, Wytsturt Annas Adema 36079, Frizo Wouter 33116, Haubois Annas Adema 44162, Diamant 33251, Haskera Governeur 44506, Hiltjes Adema 37910, Rotterda Paul 36498, Jelsumer Rudolf Jan 42884 and Adema 25473. The evaluation of bull’s inheritable features was done with help of features of descendant’s productivity and cattle’s were chosen and bought very purposefully. From 1967 till 1976 the following breeds were created: B. Pieter LJ 305, Sietse LJ 340, Hildoj 363, Katso LJ 483, Vautero LJ 738 and some lines of Klaso LJ 335, Adema LJ 770. Paulio LJ 771, Imperatoriaus LJ 1160, Burto LJ 2085, LangerioLJ 2523 descent. In thirty latter years Black and White cattle’s in Lithuania were being intensively improved by Black and White breed from Holland, Denmark, England and Germany and by Holsteins breed from America and Canada. The results of survey showed that the influence of bulls to the productivity of Black and White cows fluctuated from 1 per cent to 9 per cent. It showed that the major bull lines have already become genealogical but not zoo technical, so it is worth to calcification the line of Black and White bulls. The variety of block stock calfs is rather wide. There are bulls of really high quality and lower in the same lines of cattle. The descendants of W. A. Burke Lad 697789 line are special because of their breed value. High value of breed belonged to the lines of P. F. A. Chief 1427381, O. Ivanhoe 1189870, P. Bootmaker 1450228 and Elevation 1491007 descents. Such breeds as Langerio LJ 2523 cows of related groups, Black and White cows from Holland and W. A. Burke Lad 697789 and their descendants had good reproductive features...|$|R
