Cracking can allow moisture to penetrate and corrode the reinforcement. This is a serviceability failure in <b>limit</b> <b>state</b> design. Cracking is normally the result of an inadequate quantity of rebar, or rebar spaced at too great a distance. The concrete then cracks either under excess loading, or due to internal effects such as early thermal shrinkage while it cures.|$|E

In {{the first part}} of the thesis, the measurement process and overview of existing documentation is described. Due to inaccessibility and prohibition of structure modifying, at many parts of the structure the basis for drawing an architectural plan of existing situation were old plans and old instructions for building timber roofs. Afterwards, 3 D architectural model of roof structure was made. It was the basis for computational model, which was determined by taking Eurocode standards and manual for the design of building structures to Eurocode standards into account. Such as an architectural model, the computational models for every structure element, which carried out controls in <b>limit</b> <b>states</b> are also shown.

2500|$|Priestley's friends {{urged him}} to publish a work on the injustices borne by Dissenters, a topic {{to which he had}} already alluded in his Essay on a Course of Liberal Education for Civil and Active Life (1765). The result was Priestley's Essay on the First Principles of Government, which Priestley's major modern biographer calls his [...] "most {{systematic}} political work," [...] in 1768. The book went through three English editions and was translated into Dutch. Jeremy Bentham credited it with inspiring his [...] "greatest happiness principle." [...] The Essay on Government is not strictly utilitarian, however; like all of Priestley's works, it is infused with the belief that society is progressing towards perfection. Although much of the text rearticulates John Locke's arguments from his Two Treatises on Government (1689), it also makes a useful distinction between political and civil rights and argues for protection of extensive civil rights. He distinguishes between a private and a public sphere of governmental control; education and religion, in particular, he maintains, are matters of private conscience and should not be administered by the state. As Kramnick states, [...] "Priestley's fundamental maxim of politics was the need to <b>limit</b> <b>state</b> interference on individual liberty." [...] For early liberals like Priestley and Jefferson, the [...] "defining feature of liberal politics" [...] was its emphasis on {{the separation of church and}} state.

40|$|The {{passage of}} {{vehicular}} traffic over short-span steel highway bridges generates cumulative fatigue damage within the supporting plate girders. Over time, fatigue crack growth {{may lead to}} the untimely occurrence of elastic <b>limit</b> <b>states</b> which may cause a bridge to become structurally deficient or even collapse. It may be useful for structural engineers to be able to design or otherwise modify plate girders for presumed through-thickness fatigue crack configurations so that the premature occurrence of elastic <b>limit</b> <b>states</b> may be averted. The objective of this research was to develop theoretical expressions for the residual bending moment and shear force strengths of I-shaped, transversely stiffened, steel plate girders corresponding to various elastic <b>limit</b> <b>states.</b> Several through-thickness fatigue crack configurations were considered. The formulation of the expressions employed various theories from solid mechanics including elasticity theory, linear elastic fracture mechanics, classical plate theory, and the principle of stationary potential energy. Finite element analyses were then conducted to validate the formulated expressions. The correspondence between the analytical and numerical results was generally in good agreement. Plots of the formulated and validated expressions as functions of crack length and load cycle demonstrated that various elastic <b>limit</b> <b>states</b> influence the overall residual strength of a fatigue-cracked plate girder at varying scales; certain <b>limit</b> <b>states</b> may be neglected in favor of more detrimental <b>limit</b> <b>states.</b> A design procedure for modifying the initial design of a plate girder for prescribed fatigue crack configurations was finally developed and demonstrated by employing the newly formulated and validated expressions. ...|$|R
