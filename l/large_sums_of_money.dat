5|$|Heywood {{served as}} an {{intermediary}} linking western companies to powerful Chinese politicians. He was a long-time associate of the Bo family: he reportedly shared a close personal relationship with Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, and had helped the couple's son Bo Guagua earn admission to Harrow School in England. Heywood also allegedly served as a middleman for the family, helping them clandestinely move <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> overseas.|$|E
5|$|The Abwehr {{was right}} {{to worry about the}} {{presence}} of British double agents within their secret service. They were at that time already running 'Garbo' (Juan Pujol), 'Zig-Zag' (Eddie Chapman) and 'Tricycle' (Dušan Popov), supposedly German agents to whom they were paying <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> but who were in reality working for the British and were supplying the Germans with false information.|$|E
5|$|Although Athenian {{women were}} not legally {{permitted}} to dispose of <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> they frequently had large dowries which supported them throughout their lives. Income from a dowry could be significant. The larger a woman's dowry relative to her husband's wealth, the more influence she was likely {{to have in the}} household since she retained the dowry if the couple divorced. Athenian women could also acquire property by inheritance if they were the closest surviving relative, but could not contractually acquire or dispose of property.|$|E

5|$|His horses raced at the Del Mar Racetrack, and he {{invested}} <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> in the hobby. Murphy had {{a gambling}} habit that left his finances {{in a poor}} state. In 1968 he stated that he lost $260,000 in an Algerian oil deal and was dealing with the Internal Revenue Service over unpaid taxes. In spite of his financial difficulties, Murphy refused to appear in commercials for alcohol and cigarettes, mindful of the influence he {{would have on the}} youth market.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the band}} had been offered <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> to reunite for concerts and tours, and had turned the offers down. Rumors of tension between de la Rocha and the other former band members {{subsequently}} circulated, but Commerford {{said that he and}} de la Rocha saw each other often and went surfing together, while Morello said he and de la Rocha communicated by phone, and had met up at a September 15, 2005 protest in support of the South Central Farm.|$|E
5|$|Rockefeller {{would support}} Baptist missionary activity, fund universities, and heavily engage in {{religious}} activities at his Cleveland, Ohio church. While traveling the South, he would donate <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> to churches {{belonging to the}} Southern Baptist Convention, various Black churches, {{as well as other}} Christian denominations. One time, he paid for a slave's freedom and donated to a Roman Catholic orphanage. As he grew rich, his donations became more generous, especially to his church in Cleveland; nevertheless, it was demolished in 1925, and replaced with another building.|$|E
60|$|He was guarded in his letter. He {{mentioned}} no definite figures. He {{wrote that}} Ira Nutcombe of {{whom they had}} spoken so often had most surprisingly left him in his will a <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> and eased his conscience by telling himself that half of a million pounds undeniably was a <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{most common}} tactic used by Palestinians during the Intifada was {{throwing}} stones, molotov cocktails, and burning tires. The local leadership in some West Bank towns commenced non-violent protests against Israeli occupation {{by engaging in}} tax resistance and other boycotts. Israel responded by confiscating <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> in house-to-house raids. As the Intifada came to a close, new armed Palestinian groups—in particular Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)—began targeting Israeli civilians with the new tactic of suicide bombings, and internal fighting amongst the Palestinians increased dramatically.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} brands ran {{commercials}} {{tied to the}} 2012 apocalypse in the months and days leading to the date. In February 2012, American automotive company General Motors aired an advertisement during the annual Super Bowl football game in which {{a group of friends}} drove Chevrolet Silverados through the ruins of human civilization following the 2012 apocalypse, while on 17 December 2012, Jell-O ran an ad saying that offering Jell-O to the Mayan gods would appease them into sparing the world. John Verret, Professor of Advertising at Boston University, questioned the utility of tying <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> to such a unique and short-term event.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving his}} first wife, Elizabeth, he married {{for the second}} time, on 20 September 1858, to Adeline de Horsey, {{achieving}} still greater notoriety {{as he had been}} conducting an affair with her as his wife was dying. This, however, was a happy union, notwithstanding the disparity in their ages and Cardigan's disappointment that there were, again, no children. Adeline, excluded from fashionable society {{for the rest of her}} days, accustomed herself to life in the country, happily forsaking her previous interests of books, painting and music, while Brudenell spent <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> making their home together comfortable. Adeline even remained on good terms with Brudenell's principal mistress, Maria Marchioness of Ailesbury, and tolerated his other affairs.|$|E

5|$|As her {{relationship}} with Mike progresses, Susan becomes suspicious of his past, especially when she finds a gun and <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> in his kitchen cabinets. Additionally, evidence connecting Mike {{to the murder of}} Wisteria Lane resident, Martha Huber (Christine Estabrook), surfaces. Susan ends the relationship when police inform her that Mike was convicted of manslaughter and drug trafficking. However, Susan learns the murder was accidental and the two renew their relationship and agree that Mike will move into Susan's house. While Mike is away on business, Susan finds Zach, armed with a handgun, in Mike's house. He vows to kill Mike when he comes home as he believes Mike killed Paul.|$|E
5|$|As his sixtieth {{birthday}} {{approached in}} 1939, Beecham was advised by his doctors {{to take a}} year's break from conducting, and he planned to go abroad to rest in a warm climate, leaving the orchestra in other hands. The outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 obliged him to postpone his plans for several months, while he strove to secure {{the future of the}} orchestra, whose financial guarantees had been withdrawn by its backers when war was declared. The original LPO company was liquidated and Beecham raised <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> for the orchestra, helping its members to form themselves into a self-governing body.|$|E
5|$|As his sixtieth {{birthday}} approached, Beecham {{was advised}} by his doctors {{to take a}} year's complete break from music, and he planned to go abroad to rest in a warm climate. The Australian Broadcasting Commission had been seeking for several years {{to get him to}} conduct in Australia. The outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 obliged him to postpone his plans for several months, striving instead to secure the future of the London Philharmonic, whose financial guarantees had been withdrawn by its backers when war was declared. Before leaving, Beecham raised <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> for the orchestra and helped its members to form themselves into a self-governing company.|$|E

5|$|Wilfrid left <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> to his monastic foundations, {{enabling}} them to purchase royal favour. Soon after his death a Vita Sancti Wilfrithi, was written by Stephen of Ripon, a monk of Ripon. The first version appeared in about 715 followed by a later revision in the 730s, the first biography written by a contemporary to appear in England. It was commissioned by two of Wilfrid's followers, Acca of Hexham, and the Abbot of Ripon, Tatbert. Stephen's Vita is concerned with vindicating Wilfrid and making a case for his sainthood, and so is used with caution by historians, although it is nevertheless an invaluable source for Wilfrid's life {{and the history of}} the time.|$|E
5|$|Delacroix, who was of French origin, met {{the king}} in Paris {{as a young}} girl, {{when she was only}} 16 and he was 65. At that time, she earned her living as a prostitute. They soon {{embarked}} upon a relationship that was to last until his death in 1909. Leopold lavished upon her <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> estates, gifts, and a noble title, Baroness Vaughan. Because of these presents, Caroline was deeply unpopular both among the Belgian people and internationally, as Leopold became increasingly criticized for his greed-induced actions in the Congo Free State, his own personal colony. As Caroline largely profited off the income from the colony, she became known as La reine du Congo (“the Queen of Congo”).|$|E
5|$|Ramírez Treviño was {{an active}} {{participant}} and coordinator of cocaine and marijuana shipments heading to the United States from Mexico. He is also involved in moving <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> from drug sales heading back to Mexico from the U.S. through the Reynosa corridor. He was also the leader of Los Metros, a Gulf Cartel subgroup. In 2008, {{he was charged with}} a federal indictment in the District of Columbia for violations of Title 21 USC Sections 959, 960, 963, and Title 18 USC Section 2. The United States Department of State was offering up to US$5 million for information leading to his arrest and/or conviction. Mexico, however, did not have him on its most-wanted list and was not offering any financial reward for information leading to his arrest.|$|E

50|$|Alexander had {{entrusted}} him {{to build}} the new city of Alexandria. Cleomenes informed the people of Canopus, then the chief emporium of Egypt, that he must move them to the new city. To avert such an evil they provided him with a <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> But, as the building of Alexandria advanced, he again demanded {{that the people of}} Canopus pay him a <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> which they could not pay. So this provided him with the excuse for removing them.|$|R
5|$|Since {{the genre}} began, many shows have offered prizes of <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> to contestants; Teddy Nadler set the {{original}} monetary winnings record of $264,000 during his appearance on The $64,000 Challenge in 1957. Nadler was not surpassed until 1980, when Thom McKee won $312,700 on Tic-Tac-Dough. In 1999, John Carpenter won $1,000,000 on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, {{becoming the first}} person to win a seven-figure prize on an American game show. Since then, many players have gone on to win that amount and even surpassed it. As of 2015, Brad Rutter is the highest-earning American game show contestant of all time, having accumulated a total of $4,555,102. He succeeded Ken Jennings as the highest-earning contestant by virtue of his victory on May 16, 2014, in the Jeopardy! Battle of the Decades tournament.|$|E
5|$|Sir George {{created a}} deer park that ranged far north of Radyr. Tenant farmers there were evicted, {{and the loss}} of rental income contributed to the decline in the family's fortunes. He had 24 children, eight of whom were illegitimate. Many were daughters, and Sir George needed <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> for their dowries. On his death Sir George's lands passed to his eldest son William, who also became a MP and {{invested}} in the Pentyrch ironworks. This was an astute move as feudalism was giving way to early industrialisation. William's descendants inherited a diminishing fortune. Captain George Mathew, the last of the family to live in Radyr, married Elizabeth Poyntz, and the couple left Radyr to live on her estates at Thurles in County Tipperary, Ireland in 1625.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine government's alarm {{continued}} under de Oca's successor, Estanislao Zeballos. In June 1908, Zeballos {{presented a}} plan to the Argentine Congress where they would offer the Brazilian government a chance to give one of their two unfinished dreadnoughts to Argentina. This would allow the two countries a chance to enjoy relative naval parity. Should the Brazilians refuse, Zeballos planned to issue an ultimatum: {{if they did not}} comply in eight days, the mobilized Argentine Army would invade what the army and navy ministers claimed was a defenseless Rio de Janeiro. Unfortunately for Zeballos, his plan was leaked to the media, and the resulting public outcry—Argentine citizens happened to not be in favor of their government borrowing <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> to mobilize the army and go to war—ensured his resignation.|$|E
