40|$|Soccer {{is a rich}} domain for {{the study}} of multiagent {{learning}} issues. Not only must the players learn <b>low-level</b> <b>skills,</b> but they must also learn to work together and to adapt to the behaviors of different opponents. We are using a robotic soccer system to study these different types of multiagent learning: <b>low-level</b> <b>skills,</b> collaborative, and adversarial. Here we describe in detail our experimental framework. We present a learned, robust, low-level behavior that is necessitated by the multiagent nature of the domain, namely shooting a moving ball. We then discuss the issues that arise as we extend the learning scenario to require collaborative and adversarial learning. ...|$|E
40|$|Theorists {{of reading}} {{comprehension}} failure are split between two groups: those that posit low-level word reading skills and phonological awareness as underlying factors of poor comprehension ability {{and those that}} consider poor comprehension as partially independent of these <b>low-level</b> <b>skills.</b> Several studies with children have now demonstrated that poor comprehenders with adequate decoding skills make up a small but significant proportion of poor readers. One promising hypothesis posits that semantic processing deficits underlie these children's comprehension difficulties. This hypothesis was supported by findings that demonstrated less-skilled comprehenders to show poorer than average performance {{on a variety of}} semantic tasks. In order to test whether these findings would generalize to adult poor comprehenders, we evaluated the dissociability of high-level and <b>low-level</b> <b>skills</b> in adults. In addition, we evaluated whether adult less-skilled comprehenders (with adequate decoding abilities) have semantic processing difficulties. A PCA compared the reading skills of large group of college aged readers and found that high level skills such as reading comprehension and vocabulary were partly dissociable from low-level reading skills such as decoding ability. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the semantic processing deficit hypothesis, adult skilled and less-skilled comprehenders were compared on several behavioral and electrophysiological tests of semantic and phonological processing. The findings from these studies revealed that less-skilled comprehenders generated fewer semantic associates in a verbal fluency task and showed reduced categorical priming in an automatic semantic priming task. Additionally, electrophysiological records of less-skilled comprehenders differed from skilled readers during a semantic processing task but no during a phonological processing task. Taken together these findings provide evidence that supports semantic knowledge/semantic processing differences between skilled and less-skilled comprehenders. Implications of these findings are discussed within the construct of an experience based model of semantic knowledge acquisition...|$|E
40|$|It is {{cooperation}} {{that essentially}} differentiates multi-agent systems (MASs) from single-agent intelligence. In realistic MAS {{applications such as}} RoboCup, repeated work has shown that traditional machine learning (ML) approaches have difficulty mapping directly from cooperative behaviours to actuator outputs. To overcome this problem, vertical layered architectures are commonly used to break cooperation down into behavioural layers; ML has then been used to generate different <b>low-level</b> <b>skills,</b> and a planning mechanism added to create high-level cooperation. We propose a novel method called Policy Search Planning (PSP), in which Policy Search is used to find an optimal policy for selecting plans from a plan pool. PSP extends an existing gradient-search method (GPOMDP) to a MAS domain. We demonstrate how PSP {{can be used in}} RoboCup Simulation, and our experimental results reveal robustness, adaptivity, and outperformance over other methods. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E

40|$|Playing a game is {{a complex}} skill that {{comprises}} a set of more basic skills which map onto the component mechanics of the game. Basic skills and mechanics typically build and depend on {{each other in a}} nested learning hierarchy, which game designers have modelled as skill chains of skill atoms. For players to optimally learn and enjoy a game, it should introduce skill atoms in the ideal sequence of this hierarchy or chain. However, game designers typically construct and use hypothetical skill chains based solely on design intent, theory, or personal observation, rather than empirical observation of players. To address this need, this paper presents an adapted cognitive task analysis method for eliciting the empirical skill chain of a game. A case study illustrates and critically reflects the method. While effective in foregrounding overlooked <b>low-level</b> <b>skills</b> required by a game, its efficiency and generalizability remain to be proven...|$|E

Taking advantage of these characteristics of picturebooks, it is possible that develop high-level reading skills at children starting from early ages as well.

Robots are {{a unique opportunity}} to create new systems to cooperate in reaching better living conditions. Robots offer the possibility of richer interaction with humans, and can perform actions to actively change the environment. The current state-of-art includes skills in various areas, including advanced interaction (natural language, visual attention, object recognition, intention learning), navigation (map learning, obstacle avoidance), manipulation (grasping, use of tools), and cognitive architectures to handle highly unpredictable environments. From our experience in several robotics projects and principally in the RoboCup@Home competition, a new set of evaluation methods is proposed to assess the maturity of the required skills.

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the impact of computers on the quality and quantity of student writing, the number of revisions made by the students, and the attitudes of the students toward writing. The participants in this study were forty-three first-grade students. As the students learned the steps of the writing process, they worked with a partner to write a story. The students in the control group wrote with paper and pencil, while the students in the experimental group wrote on the computer. The results of the study indicated that the students who wrote on the computer wrote better quality stories, wrote longer stories, made more revisions, and had a better overall attitude toward writing. Writing is one of the most complex and difficult skills that students learn in school. The reason for its complexity is that writing consists of <b>low-level</b> <b>skills,</b> such as handwriting, spelling, grammar, and punctuation; as well as more substantive areas of content generation, organization of text, and quality of revision (Schwartz & MacArthur, 1990).

Twenty-five children with VCFS and 25 individually matched controls (age range: 6 – 12 years) participated. They all completed two basic number processing tasks (number reading, number comparison) and three single-digit arithmetic tasks comprising addition, subtraction and multiplication. In the latter tasks, strategy use was recorded next to accuracy and speed. Our data revealed that children with VCFS were significantly slower than controls on number comparison but not on number reading. Analysis of the single-digit arithmetic data revealed that children with VCFS performed more poorly than controls on large addition and subtraction problems. Both groups did not differ on multiplication and small additions and subtractions. At the strategy level, children with VCFS were significantly slower in executing backup strategies in addition and subtraction, but showed preserved retrieval of arithmetic facts. Taken together, children with VCFS show a consistent pattern of deficits at the level of number representations, arithmetic operations and strategy use, which suggests an impaired quantity subsystem in terms of Dehaene et al. ’s model [Dehaene S, Piazza M, Pinel P, and Cohen L.

The agents operate in the RoboCup SOCCER SERVER (Noda et al. 1998), a robotic soccer sim-ulator.
