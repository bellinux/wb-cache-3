40|$|Thirty-nine {{patients}} {{were treated with}} GAX collagen for vocal fold augmentation. The objective results were evaluated by measurement of the maximum phonation time, the phonatory quotient, vocal frequency analysis, and <b>laryngostroboscopy.</b> These results {{are as good as}} those with Zyderm Collagen II (ZCI). Avoidance of useless overcorrection, better resistance to collagenase, and less induced hypersensitivity differentiate GAX from ZCI...|$|E
40|$|The {{records of}} 14 {{patients}} who have benefited from intralaryngeal injections of ZCI collagen for at least 3 - 4 years were reviewed. All patients still living were evaluated. Qualitative phonatory measurements included <b>laryngostroboscopy</b> and frequency voice analysis, while quantitative studies included maximum phonation times and phonatory quotients. The absence of both local and general inflammatory reactions was observed in these patients, confirming the excellent host tolerance of ZCI collagen and {{the stability of the}} functional results achieved...|$|E
40|$|To {{analyze the}} results of two {{objective}} methods (the <b>laryngostroboscopy</b> and the acoustic analysis of the voice) and of two subjective methods (the vocal handicap index (V. H. I.) and the quality life index (Q. L.

40|$|In {{order to}} test the {{hypotheses}} that nonsurgical treatment and elimination of inappropriate use of the voice is sufficient for disappearance of vocal fold nodules (VN), 28 classical singers with these lesions were examined {{for a period of}} up to 24 years after establishing this diagnosis. Twenty vocally healthy female singers constituted the control group. Laryngoscopy, microlaryngoscopy, <b>laryngostroboscopy</b> and acoustic voice analyses were used to carry out this research. It was found that VN, having once occurred, tended to reoccur despite nonsurgical treatment and the elimination of incorrect singing. It was concluded that physiologically correct singing leads only to a temporary disappearance of soft nodules and does not promote the resolution of hard nodules...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Diffusion-weighted {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (DWI) has been introduced in head and neck cancers. Due to limitations {{in the performance of}} laryngeal DWI, including the complex anatomical structure of the larynx leading to susceptibility effects, the value of DWI in differentiating benign from malignant laryngeal lesions has largely been ignored. We assessed whether a threshold for the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was useful in differentiating preoperative laryngeal carcinomas from precursor lesions by turbo spin-echo (TSE) DWI and 3. 0 -T {{magnetic resonance}}. METHODS: We evaluated DWI and the ADC value in 33 pathologically proven laryngeal carcinomas and 17 precancerous lesions. RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 81. 8 %, 64. 7 %, 76. 0 % by <b>laryngostroboscopy,</b> respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of conventional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} were 90. 9 %, 76. 5 %, 86. 0 %, respectively. Qualitative DWI analysis produced sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values of 100. 0, 88. 2, and 96. 0 %, respectively. The ADC values were lower for patients with laryngeal carcinoma (mean 1. 195 ± 0. 32 × 10 (- 3) mm(2) /s) versus those with laryngeal precancerous lesions (mean 1. 780 ± 0. 32 × 10 (- 3) mm(2) /s; P< 0. 001). ROC analysis showed that the area under the curve was 0. 956 and the optimum threshold for the ADC was 1. 455 × 10 (- 3) mm(2) /s, resulting in a sensitivity of 94. 1 %, a specificity of 90. 9 %, and an accuracy of 92. 9 %. CONCLUSIONS: Despite some limitations, including the small number of laryngeal carcinomas included, DWI may detect changes in tumor size and shape before they are visible by <b>laryngostroboscopy.</b> The ADC values were lower for patients with laryngeal carcinoma than for those with laryngeal precancerous lesions. The proposed cutoff for the ADC may help distinguish laryngeal carcinomas from laryngeal precancerous lesions...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Dysphonia is {{the most}} {{frequent}} symptom of vocal cord carcinoma In the diagnostics of the disease subjective and objective methods of examination (acoustic analysis of a voice signal) and a <b>laryngostroboscopy</b> and aerodynamic exam­ination are used. METHODS: Our clinical prospective study consisted of 40 male patients, who had malignant tumors of one vocal cord - right or left. All the patients underwent otorhino-laryngological and phoniatric examination. The quality of voice was evaluated and estimated according to the 4 -level GIRBAS scale (grade-instability-roughness-breathi-ness-asthenic-strain). Aerodynamic analysis dealt with vital capacity (VC), maximum phonation time (MPT) and phonation quotient (PQ). RESULTS: Vibration of vocal cord {{did not exist in}} 60 % of cases. Instability and strained voice was present in 100 % of cases. Mean average value of phonation quotient was 303. 33 ml/s. The influence of roughness (R), instability (I), asthenic (A), and strain (S) on the total degree of dysphonia (G), was in all cases in a significantly positive correlation with the level of statistic significance p< 0. 01 for I, R and S and level p< 0. 05 for A. Nonvibration of a vocal cord had significant influence on the grade of dysphonia and strain (negative correlation, level p< 0. 01), and on the instability (negative correlation, level p< 0. 01). Maximum phonation time had statistically significant influence (negative correlation) on the phonation quotient. CONCLUSION: The voices of all patients who had glottal carcinoma T 1 and T 2 were psychoacoustically characterized by strain and instability of phonation. It is certain that a patient has glottal carcinoma if he/she has values of phonation quotient higher than 300 ml/s, nonvibration of a vocal cord in <b>laryngostroboscopy</b> and strained voice in psychoacoustic analysis...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. A {{persistent}} insufficiency of glottal closure {{is mostly}} a consequence of impaired unilateral vocal fold movement. Functional surgical treatment is required because of the consequential voice, breathing and swallowing impairments. The goal {{of the study was}} to determine the functional voice outcomes after medialization thyroplasty with using autologous septal cartilage from the nose. Methods. External vocal fold medialization using autologous nasal septal cartilage was performed on 15 patients (6 females and 9 males; age range, 30 to 57 years). Detailed functional examinations were performed for all the patients before and after the surgery and this included perceptual voice assessment, laryngostroboscopic examination and acoustic voice analysis. Results. All the patients reported improvement of voice quality post-operatively. <b>Laryngostroboscopy</b> revealed almost complete glottal closure after surgery in the majority of patients. Acoustic and perceptual voice assessment showed significant improvement post-operatively. Conclusion. Medialization thyroplasty using an autologous nasal septal cartilage implant offers good tissue tolerability and significant improvement of the subjective and objective functional voice outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Investigate whether vocal {{problems}} in future professional {{activities can be}} predicted by early laryngeal and phoniatric evaluation and whether a vocal endurance test can contribute to this evaluation. Study Design: Five-year follow-up study of 30 female education majors, initially documented with a standard voice assessment and a vocal endurance test. Measurements before and after vocal endurance testing were compared and related to the vocal outcome 5 years after the initial testing. Methods: Voice assessment included perceptual evaluation, airflow measurements, Fo and SPL measurements, voice range profile and laryngeal (stroboscopic) examination. The Standard Tolerance Test, as recommended by the Union of European Phoniatricians, was followed. This data set was completed with a questionnaire concerning the subjects' vocal behavior. This questionnaire was repeated 5 years later. Results: No {{significant differences were found}} for ENT scores (<b>laryngostroboscopy)</b> (P =. 018). Logistic regression was used to determine a relationship between initial observations and the final outcome. Conclusions: The role of an endurance test as used in this study is negligible for the prediction of vocal outcome. A combination of laryngeal examination, maximum phonation time, and perceptual evaluation, assessed prior to the endurance test, reveals a prediction of the vocal outcome with a specificity of 90 % and a sensitivity of 70 %...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Vocal fold lesions {{related to}} {{autoimmune}} dis-eases are rheumatoid nodules and, {{to a lesser}} extent, bamboo nodes. Mostly transverse, they {{are located in the}} middle third of the vocal cord and exhibit a yellowish appearance. The characteristic shape of these lesions led to their name. These vocal fold deposits may interfere with the normal vibratory cycle during phonation and thus may be an unusual cause of hoarseness. We present a 43 -year-old woman with known mixed connective tissue disease and a dysphonia. <b>Laryngostroboscopy</b> showed bamboo nodes as described above. We applied several laryngeal injections of cortisone as described previously in the lit-erature. Since this treatment did not lead to a sufficient voice improvement, we attempted to surgically remove the deposits. After the surgery, the voice improved consider-ably. In all patients with rheumatic diseases who suffer from a rough, breathy, or unstable voice, a laryngostrobo-scopic examination should be done. If, however, a bamboo node lesion of the vocal folds is found by the laryngolo-gists, an associated autoimmune disorder must be assumed, and adequate diagnostic procedures have to be initiated. Local laryngeal injections (1 – 3 times) with steroids should be the first line of therapy. In unsuccessful cases, subsequent surgery can be a useful treatment of bamboo nodes to stabilize and improve voice quality...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} quantitatively the basic parameters of the video <b>laryngostroboscopy</b> (VLS) and determine the sensitivity and specificity of these parameters discriminating healthy and pathological voice classes. METHODS: Digital VLS recordings were performed for 159 individuals: 26 healthy and 133 patients. VLS variables (glottal closure, regularity, mucosal wave on the affected/healthy side, symmetry of vibration, and symmetry of image) were rated two times with the time interval of 1 year by three laryngologists. To evaluate interrater and test-retest reliability, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated. To evaluate sensitivity and specificity of the VLS parameters, discriminant analysis was used. RESULTS: Moderate to almost perfect levels (ICC 0. 46 - 0. 90) of interrater reliability were revealed for most of the basic VLS parameters. The ICC of the interrater reliability was highest for symmetry of glottal image; the most problematic VLS parameter for rating was mucosal wave on the healthy side. ICC of the test-retest reliability were 0. 71 - 0. 95, P< 0. 001. An optimum system of VLS parameters discriminating normal and pathological voice subgroups with sensitivity 96. 3 % and specificity 100 % included glottal closure and mucosal wave on the affected side. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative evaluation of the VLS using basic parameters showed to be reliable in clinical settings and demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity distinguishing healthy and pathological voice patient groups...|$|E
40|$|At present, it is {{difficult}} to identify a gold standard for endoscopic staging of laryngeal cancer, especially considering the large number of endoscopic instruments available. We have coined the term multistep endoscopy to describe a method for staging laryngeal precancerous and neoplastic lesions that sequentially uses several endoscopic tools including high definition white light endoscopy (HDTV), stroboscopy and autofluorescence endoscopy. During the period from November 2007 to November 2009, 140 patients with a suspect laryngeal lesion underwent multistep endoscopy at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology at Martini Hospital in Turin. All patients were subjected to a series of endoscopic examinations in indirect laryngoscopy (white light endoscopy coupled to a HDTV camera, <b>laryngostroboscopy,</b> indirect autofluorescence) followed by white light endoscopy coupled to a HDTV camera and autofluorescence in direct microlaryngoscopy. The aim of the present prospective study was to evaluate the utility of multistep endoscopy in the diagnostic work-up of laryngeal lesions. Multistep endoscopy showed a higher sensitivity and "biological" predictive value in early cancer and precancerous lesions of the larynx (sensitivity, 97. 9 %; specificity, 90. 5 %) compared to individual endoscopic tools. It allows for better therapeutic planning of superficial lesions and more accurate orientation when performing mapping biopsies on diffuse lesions. In our opinion, more widespread use of indirect autofluorescence endoscopy during follow-up may be warranted to search for synchronous/metachronous second tumours of the upper aerodigestive tract...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} different electrical parameter settings on the intelligibility of speech in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) bilaterally treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Ten patients treated with DBS for 15 +/- 5 months (mean, SD) with significant (P < 0. 01) symptom reduction (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III) were included. In the medication off condition, video <b>laryngostroboscopy</b> was performed and then, in random order, 1 1 DBS parameter settings were tested. Amplitude was increased and decreased by 25 %, frequency was varied in the range 70 to 185 pps, {{and each of the}} contacts was tested separately as a cathode. The patients read a standard running text and five nonsense sentences per setting. A listener panel transcribed the nonsense sentences as perceived and valued the quality of speech on a visual analogue scale. With the patients' normally used settings, there was no significant (P = 0. 058) group difference between DBS OFF and ON, but in four patients the intelligibility deteriorated with DBS ON. The higher frequencies or increased amplitude caused significant (P < 0. 02) impairments of intelligibility, whereas changing the polarity between the separate contacts did not. The settings of amplitude and frequency have a major influence on the intelligibility of speech, emphasizing the importance of meticulous parameter adjustments when programming DBS to minimize side effects related to speech...|$|E
40|$|Background: Arytenoid {{cartilage}} dislocation/subluxation {{is one of}} {{the rare}} complications following tracheal intubation, and there have been no reports about risk factors leading this complication. From our clinical experience, we have an impression that patients undergoing cardiovascular operations tend to be associated with this complication. Aims: We designed a large retrospective study to reveal the incidence and risk factors predicting the occurrence and to examine whether our impression is true. Settings and Designs: This was a retrospective study. Methods: We retrospectively studied 19, 437 adult patients who were intubated by an anesthesiologist in our operation theater from 2002 to 2008. The tracheal intubation was performed by a resident anesthesiologist managing the patients. Only patients whose postoperative voice was disturbed more than 7 days were referred to the Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery and examined using <b>laryngostroboscopy</b> by a laryngologist to diagnose arytenoid cartilage dislocation/subluxation. We evaluated age, sex, weight, height, duration of intubation, difficult intubation, and major cardiovascular operation as risk factors to lead this complication. Statistical Analysis: The data were analyzed by logistic regression analysis to assess factors for arytenoid cartilage dislocation/subluxation after univariate analyses using logistic regression analysis. Results: Our analysis indicated that difficult intubation (odds ratio: 12. 1, P = 0. 018) and cardiovascular operation (odds ratio: 9. 9, P < 0. 001) were significant risk factors of arytenoid cartilage dislocation/subluxation. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that major cardiovascular operation {{is one of the}} significant risk factors leading this complication...|$|E
40|$|The {{voice of}} {{patients}} indicated for surgical procedures in treating of dysphonia is already damaged before the operation. The problem, which exists {{at the level}} of glottis patients usually try to solve by compensative mechanisms. The quality of voice after the interventions in larynx depends on the type and width of resection, disturbance of physiological phonation mechanisms, and ability to establish optimal phonation automatism. The damage of laryngeal structure, especially its glottic part and vocal cords as its central part, no matter if they are just fibrous or they are partially or totally absent, leads into the development of substitutive phonation mechanisms. The most frequent substitutive mechanisms are: vestibular, ventricular, and chordoventricular phonation. There are some variations of these phonation mechanisms, which are conditioned not only by applied surgical technique, but as they are also individual characteristics, they can be the consequence of applied rehabilitation methods. The diagnosis of voice condition before and after the oncosurgical procedure is done by: <b>laryngostroboscopy,</b> subjective acoustic analysis of voice, and objective acoustic analysis of voice (sonography or computer analysis of acoustic signal). The most of laryngeal carcinomas appear in glottic region, so the function of phonation imposes itself as the objective parameter to measure the quality of life after the oncosurgery of larynx. That is the reason why according to the priority, it is just behind the principle of "oncologic radicalism". Phonation as the most complex laryngeal function seems to have secondary importance. All known operative techniques, especially partial resections, have the preservation of phonation as their goal...|$|E

40|$|Introduction A phoniatrist {{analyzes}} the professional's {{voice at the}} beginning of his vocal studies or career but also later, in cases of voice disorder. Phoniatric examination of professional singers must be done according to "all inclusive" protocols of examination. Such protocols must establish the status of basic elements of phonatory system: activator generator and resonator of voice and articulatory space. Anamnesis All patients requiring phoniatric examination no matter if they are candidates for professional singers, need to provide anamnestic data about their previous problems regarding voice or singing. Clinical examination This examination is necessary and it must include: examination of nose, cavum oris, pharynx, ears and larynx. Subjective acoustic analysis This analysis is based on evaluation of physiological and pathophysiological manifestations of voice. Musical voice range Determination of musical voice range during phoniatric examination does not intend to make any classification of voice, nor to suggest to vocal teacher what he should count upon from future singers. Musical range can be determined only by a phoniatrist skilled in music or with musical training, but first of all vocal teacher. Objective acoustic analysis These methods are used for examination of phonatory function, or laryngeal pathology. They are not invasive and give objective and quantitative information. They include <b>laryngostroboscopy,</b> spectral analysis of voice (sonography) and fundamental parameters of voice signal (computer program). Speech examination Articulation is very important for solo singers, because good articulation contributes to qualitative emission of sound and expression of emotions. Hearing tests Tonal-threshold audiometry is performed as a hearing test. Additional tests They include rhinomanometry, vital capacity measurements maximal phonation time and phonation quotient. Conclusion Phoniatric examination is a necessary proceeding which must be performed before admission to the academy of solo singing, and then during singers' education and career. The phoniatric protocol must include a minimal number of parameters, which can be increased if required. All parameters of phoniatric examination must be adequatly evaluated by experts...|$|E
40|$|The {{voice is}} arguable {{still the most}} {{important}} tool of communication despite the growing importance of e-mails and text messaging (SMS) in daily contact. Indeed in modern society people are probably even more dependent on their voice than in the rural societies of old. Approximately {{one third of the}} working population nowadays need their voice to earn money 1. And {{it goes without saying that}} most people need their voice for daily social activities. Any impairment of the voice therefore will have large impact both on daily work and social activities for many people. Diagnosis and treatment of voice disorders is by that of great importance. The voice has a variety of characteristics and so have any of its disorders. The complaints of the patient are the starting point in any diagnosis. These complaints usually consist of ‘my voice is hoarse’. They may also concern the consequences of professional activities, like a teacher whose voice does not reach the back of the classroom, especially in a noisy one. The sound of the voice may have changed and, finally, we have to pay attention to the cause of the problems, the aetiology of the voice disorder. All these aspects need to be assessed in a description of any voice disorder. The complaints of the patient may be collected with a self-evaluation form by the patient him/herself. The character of the sound of the voice (voice quality) can be assessed subjectively with the listening ear of the diagnostician and objectively by instruments. The aetiology is determined by the thorough history taking and physical examination. The form and function of the larynx is examined with, for example, (video) <b>laryngostroboscopy.</b> The outcome of these examinations together leads to a diagnosis, which is the basis for decisions about any modality of treatment including intervention like surgical procedures, voice therapy, medication or any combination of these. The results of these interventions need to be evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Phoniatric {{rehabilitation}} {{is mainly}} aimed at restoring satisfactory phonation. Voice quality {{depends on the}} capacity of intact vocal cords to compensate the deficiency involved, {{as well as on}} automatism of phonation. Material and methods The study included 50 patients. All subjects underwent history taking, reported symptoms that urged them to visit a phoniatrician; they were submitted to a clinical otorhinolaryngologic and phoniatric examinations, voice assessment by subjective acoustic analysis spectral analysis by digital sonography and <b>laryngostroboscopy.</b> All patients underwent Seeman's method of laryngeal compression. Results The examined group of 50 subjects included 17 males (34 %) and 33 females (66 %). Vocal cord palsy was most often due to neck surgery (strumectomy) in 19 patients (38 %) followed by an idiopathic palsy involved in 12 patients (24 %). Disocclusion of 1 - 2 mm and 3 - 3 mm was registered in 54 % and 24 % patients, respectively After treatment total occlusion was established in 20 % of patients, while disocclusion of up to 1 mm, 1 - 2 mm or 2 - 3 mm persisted in 36 %, 20 % and 2 % of patients, respectively. T-test revealed a statistically significant difference in glottic incompetence prior to and after treatment (p< 0. 01). After treatment, using Seeman's method of digital compression of the larynx 48 % of patients regained satisfactory speech and voice clarity and 50 % of them still presented mild dysphonia. Moderate dysphonia was registered in 2 % but none of the patients had severe dysphonia. Discussion Central laryngeal palsies made 4 % of our examined group, while according to the literature they make 1. 2 - 8. 7 % of all laryngeal palsies. In majority of cases, paralysis of the recurrent laryngeal nerve was due to neck surgery (38 %), but literature reports indicate that iatrogenic palsies are mostly due to operation of the thyroid. The well known fact that the left recurrent nerve is more frequently paralyzed, has been confirmed in our study as well. Conclusion Accurate and efficient treatment of unilateral laryngeal palsies requires team work Phoniatric rehabilitation of the disorder using Seeman's method has proved efficient in diminishing the glottic incompetence and dysphonia. Patients who fail to respond to phoniatric rehabilitation should be treated using other therapeutic modalities...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} {{symptoms of}} unilateral vocal fold paralysis are hoarseness and difficulty in swallowing. Dyspnea is comparatively rare (Laccourreye et al., 2003). The {{extent to which}} unilateral vocal fold paralysis may lead to respiratory problems at all - in contrast to bilateral vocal fold paralysis- has not yet well been determined. On the one hand, inspiration is impaired with unilateral vocal fold paralysis; on the other hand, neither {{the position of the}} vocal fold paralysis nor the degree of breathiness correlates with respiratory parameters (Cantarella et al., 2003; 2005). The question of what respiratory stress a patient with a vocal fold paresis can endure has not yet been dealt with. A 43 year-old female patient was suffering from recurrent unspecific respiratory complaints for four months after physical activity. During training for a marathon, she experienced no difficulty in breathing. These unspecific respiratory complaints occurred only after athletic activity and persisted for hours. The patient observed neither an increased coughing nor a stridor. Her voice remained unaltered during the attacks, nor were there any signs of a symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux or infectious disease. A cardio-pulmonary and a radiological examination by means of an X-ray of the thorax also revealed no pathological phenomena. As antiallergic and antiobstructive therapy remained unsuccessful, a laryngological examination was performed in order to exclude a vocal cord dysfunction. Surprisingly enough, the <b>laryngostroboscopy</b> showed, as an initial description, a vocal fold paralysis of the left vocal fold in median position (Figure 1). The anamnestic background for the cause was unclear. The only clue was a thoracotomy on the left side due to a pleuritis in childhood. A subsequent laryngoscopic examination had never been performed. Good mucosa waves and amplitudes were shown bilateral with complete glottal closure. Neither in the acoustic analysis, nor in the physical analysis conspicuous results were shown concerning hoarseness, shimmer or jitter. The maximum-phonation-time was slightly restricted at 11 seconds. Both vocal dynamics and frequency spectrum showed normal ratings. Neck CT and thorax region MRT were performed, showing no pathology {{in the area of the}} recurrent nerve or the vagus. The patient was re-examined at the Clinic for Sports Medicine on the basis of the laryngological results. Neither in the internal sports medical examination nor in the physical analysis were conspicuous results shown. The flow characteristics registered breath-by-breath during the ergometry (bicycle- ergometry up to 125 W) were completely unaffected up to maximal ventilation (Figure 2). The blood gases after exertion and the performance attained showed norm ratings. Two months after the examination the patient ran her first marathon. No respiratory complaints were experienced any more. Although there is one description of dyspnea due to a unilateral vocal fold paralysis published (Laccourreye et al., 2003), there are still no data regarding either the form of stress that goes together with laryngeally caused dyspnea or what machanism induces it. Both restriction of the breath cross-section and excessively high consumption of air during phonation may produce a subjective sensation of unspecific respiratory complaints. It was shown that, in vocal fold paralysis, inspirational flow is in fact reduced - in contrast to exspiratory flow (Beaty and Hoffman, 1999; Cantarella et al., 2003). However, neither the position of the fixed vocal fold nor the degree of breathiness had an influence on the breathing parameters (Cantarella et al., 2005). Beaty and Hoffman, 1999 found lower inspiratory flow rates after medialization thyreoplasty. No modification of the breathing parameters was shown after fat injection in the vocal fold (Cantarella et al., 2006). We are here describing an extraordinary achievement in an endurance form of athletics with a unilateral vocal fold paralysis for the first time. Although a marathon race is an endurance exertion without maximum acute strain on the respiratory system (McArdle et al., 2001), the sport medical examinations also showed no restriction at maximum exertion, neither expiratory nor inspiratory. An unilateral vocal fold paralysis is apparently not such a serious obstacle to the respiratory tract that one would have to reckon with a clear-cut respiratory deficit. Exercise testing of larger samples of patients with vocal fold paralysis should be performed concerning their capacity to endure exertion. The question in the present case thus remains the causal connection between the paralysis and unspecific respiratory complaints. The laryngological examination speaks against an acute event. A possible cause of the vocal fold paralysis is the thoracotomy or the pleuritis in childhood; Due to the time lapse of over 40 years, this cannot be proven. The entire diagnostic spectrum excluded another organic cause for her respiratory complaints, so that we tend to assume a functional or psychosomatic nature. As the symptoms vanished spontaneously, no further proof of this can be offere...|$|E
