Once the accretion stops the star gradually slows until the spin is no longer enough to prevent the explosion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} inning, the Yankees cut the Cardinals' lead. With two outs, Joe Dugan hit a single. Hank Severeid {{followed}} with a double, scoring Dugan, before pinch-hitter Ben Paschal grounded to Haines to end the inning. Game1 and 5 winner Herb Pennock came in relief for Hoyt in the seventh inning. He yielded only one hit in the inning and limited the Cardinals to their 3–2 lead. In {{the bottom half of}} the inning, the Yankees <b>loaded</b> <b>up</b> the bases with Earle Combs, Ruth and Lou Gehrig. At this point, there were two outs, and Haines had developed a blister on his pitching hand, and could no longer pitch in the game.|$|E

So we were experimenting and trying out different things. They all sounded good, but at the end of the day, we wanted it to sound timeless, also. Not just something of the moment.|$|E

The hurricane watch extended northward and westward {{later in the}} day to Apalachicola. Hurricane warnings were initiated on September17 for areas along the Florida coast from Anna Maria Island to Ochlockonee River. Tropical storm warnings were issued south of Anna Maria Island to Bonita Beach and west of Ochlockonee River to Indian Pass. Tropical storm warnings were also issued along the east coast of the United States from Titusville in Florida to Little River Inlet in South Carolina. The Florida Division of Emergency Management in Tallahassee issued a mandatory evacuation in Hernando County, while voluntary evacuations were called for some of the coastal areas along Florida's west coast. Anticipating that Gordon will make landfall and move inland, two tornado watches were in effect from Sarasota to Naples, and tornado warnings were issued from Orlando to Vero Beach. Flash flood warnings were also in effect in parts of Florida.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{scored the}} first {{run of the}} game in the third inning on a Babe Ruth solo home run into the right field bleachers. In the {{following}} half inning, the Cardinals came back to take a 3–1 lead over the Yankees. Jim Bottomley lined a one-out single into left field to start the Cardinals' fourth inning rally. Les Bell just barely made it to first base after shortstop Mark Koenig accidentally kicked the ball while trying to field it. With runners at first and second base, Chick Hafey hit a bloop single into left field, which <b>loaded</b> <b>up</b> the bases for catcher Bob O'Farrell. This time, left fielder Bob Meusel made an error by dropping O'Farrell's fly ball, so Bottomley scored to tie the game, and the bases remained loaded. Tommy Thevenow followed with a two-run single to right fielder Ruth. Hoyt struck out the next batter, and Wattie Holm hit into a force play at second base. All three runs in the inning were charged as unearned on Hoyt, due to the two Yankee errors.|$|E

A couple of sections of 60mm mortars covered the withdrawal, holding up the Phoumist advance {{until late in the}} day. The devastated city they left had suffered at least 600 houses destroyed, about an equal number of citizens killed, and 7,000 left homeless; however, the Neutralists' fighting ability remained intact.

25|$|On March 15, 2014, at {{approximately}} 1 p.m., the final upper deck bleachers and concrete bleacher-support girders (on the northwest {{side of the}} Metrodome) were brought down, taking away any standing remnants of the exterior stadium walls. On April 11, 2014, just after 1:30p.m., the final portion of the inner-stadium concrete walls (that were only visible due to the stadium's subsequent removal of the upper deck bleachers and baseball press box that {{stood in front of}} it) were reduced to rubble, marking the official end of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. Demolition of the Metrodome was formally declared complete on April 17, 2014, just after 1 p.m.--one full month ahead of schedule—as the final truckload of rubble was <b>loaded</b> <b>up</b> and removed from the new stadium construction site.

25|$|In 2014, the LRR {{conducted}} a trojan horse operation at a drag race to either kill or capture Abu Sayyaf target Sihata Latip, who was wanted for kidnapping 21 people in Malaysia in 2000. He {{went on to}} conduct a string of kidnappings in the Philippines over subsequent years, but as the Philippines got better at counter terrorism operation, the Islamists were cut off from overseas international terrorist finance networks, particularly the ones originating in Saudi Arabia {{and in order to}} make up for this loss in income, they engage in kidnapping for ransom. The 24 LRR soldeirs trained for a week to execute the mission. They dressed up as if going to a Muslim wedding, rented local jeeps and decorated it. Some soldiers dressed up as women to avoid raising suspicion. One soldier with a M249 light machine gun dressed as a pregnant woman, but forgot to shave {{on the day of the}} operation and had to loan a hand fan from one of the female soldiers on the base to cover his goatee. On the way to the drag race one of the jeeps broke down. The commander of the operation decided to go on with the mission with only one jeep and 13 men. When they arrived at the drag race, the LRR operators identified their High Value Target from about 50 civilians and terrorists, approached and drew weapons. A firefight ensued in which the target was killed, but at the loss of a LRR operator who got shot in the neck. The operators <b>loaded</b> <b>up</b> the two bodies and made their getaway, while being shot at by Abu Sayyaf and Moro Islamic Liberation Front.|$|E

500|$|Within ten years, over 200 {{bald eagles}} were visiting during winter and early spring each day, {{and the job}} of feeding them became more involved. To have enough fish to last through the winter, she would begin in August to {{stockpile}} fish scraps and freezer burned fish donated by her employer and by other local companies. The fish was sometimes supplemented by moose meat that Keene salvaged when she heard of a road-killed moose on the highway. She began feeding the eagles at about December 1 of each year, a job that took up to three hours' work each morning. Keene obtained permission from her employer to use a company forklift to move the large containers of stockpiled fish scraps and freezer-burned salmon, halibut, rockfish, cod, and herring out of the company's large freezers. She then transferred the fish by hand into barrels or garbage cans, which she <b>loaded</b> <b>up</b> in her pickup truck. Then she would drive the load to her motorhome, [...] about [...] from the Seward Fisheries plant, and cut the fish into fist-sized pieces to be thrown out to the eagles. If the fish was fully frozen, she would use an axe, chainsaw, or blowtorch to break the fish down into smaller chunks, or might even have to lug the large garbage cans into her motorhome to thaw. [...] "I don't know if anyone else would do this," [...] she told a reporter in 1986. [...] "My motorhome smells like fish. My yard is fish. My truck is fish. I am fish. It gets kind of gross sometimes, especially when you're handling a lot of slimy carcasses." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{this was}} going on, the United States was {{negotiating}} with Great Britain over compensation for losses inflicted by British ships knowingly sold to the Confederacy during the Civil War (the Alabama Claims). Peru {{had been involved in}} an undeclared war with Spain (the Chincha Islands War) in 1864–66 and the US was not willing to prejudice its claims against the United Kingdom by performing a similar action for a belligerent power. Negotiations over the issue delayed the departure of the two monitors until January 1869, after Peru bought two steamers, Reyes and Marañon to tow the monitors. They only reached Pensacola, Florida, before machinery breakdowns forced them to wait 30 days for repairs to be completed. En route from Key West to the Bahamas, the ships were separated in heavy weather. When Reyes attempted to reattach her towrope after the storm moderated, she collided with the sharp bow of Manco Cápac and sank in 15 minutes. The monitor, short of coal and food, was forced to make port at Naranjo, Cuba, then held by rebels against the Spanish government. They allowed the ship to restock her supplies, but no coal was available so the crew <b>loaded</b> <b>up</b> enough wood to reach the Bahamas where they were able to send a local schooner to Nassau to inform the authorities of their plight. The ships finally reunited at St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands and had to wait for the Pachitea to arrive from Peru to tow Manco Cápac. While entering Rio de Janeiro on the night of 15 September, Manco Cápac ran aground; she was refloated the following day, but the damage required three months to repair. The ships were joined by the steam corvette [...] during this time. They reached the Strait of Magellan on 29 January 1870 and Callao on 11 May.|$|E
