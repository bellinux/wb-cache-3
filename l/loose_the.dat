5|$|On {{the night}} of 12 May, U-6 headed out to try to {{intercept}} shipping between Santa Maria di Leuca and Valona. Linienschiffsleutnant Hugo von Falkhausen, U-6s commander since November 1915, attempted to pass underneath two drifters that formed {{a part of the}} Otranto Barrage. While submerged, von Falkhausen heard an unexplained noise on the hull of the boat, which was likely the sound of U-6 fouling one of the anti-submarine nets deployed from the drifter Calistoga. The drifter's skipper was alerted to the submarine's presence when one of the indicator buoys had fired. Calistoga launched signal flares that attracted the attention of two nearby drifters Dulcie Doris and Evening Star II. In the meantime, von Falkhausen surfaced U-6 to try to cut <b>loose</b> <b>the</b> buoy being dragged behind his boat. When the hatch was opened, the crew discovered the boat entangled in the net.|$|E

Each year the festival was held over {{three days in}} September and {{consisted}} of live music and water sport events including a surf competition in Spanish Point. It was notable as Ireland's first surfing and music festival. Although Cois Fharraige was a new event it managed to attract some well-known bands over the three years it was organised, such as Republic of <b>Loose,</b> <b>The</b> Coronas, The Blizzards, Noah and the Whale, Ocean Colour Scene, Laura Izibor and Delorentos.|$|E
25|$|MGR {{never fully}} {{recovered}} from his illness and died on 24 December 1987 at 3:30am in his Ramavaram Gardens residence in Manapakkam after his prolonged illness. He was almost 71. His death sparked off {{a frenzy of}} looting and rioting all over the state. Shops, cinemas, buses and other public and private property became the target of violence let <b>loose.</b> <b>The</b> police had to resort issuing shoot-at-sight orders. Schools and colleges immediately announced the holidays till the situation came in control. The violence during the funeral alone left 29 people dead and 47 police personnel badly wounded.|$|E
25|$|Tunnels were blasted {{through hard}} rock by {{drilling}} {{holes in the}} rock face by hand and filling them with black powder. Sometimes cracks were found which could be filled with powder and blasted <b>loose.</b> <b>The</b> loosened rock would be collected and hauled {{out of the tunnel}} for use in a fill area or as roadbed, or else dumped over the side as waste. A foot or so advance on a tunnel face was a typical day's work. Some tunnels took almost a year to finish and the Summit Tunnel, the longest, took almost two years. In the final days of working in the Sierras, the recently invented nitroglycerin explosive was introduced and used on the last tunnels including Summit Tunnel.|$|E

25|$|In {{the morning}} the three guides came back, {{traversing}} the face from a hole near the Eigerwand station and risking their lives under incessant avalanches. Toni Kurz was still alive but almost helpless, {{with one hand and}} one arm completely frozen. Kurz hauled himself off the cliff after cutting <b>loose</b> <b>the</b> rope that bound him to his dead teammate below and climbed back onto the face. The guides were not able to pass an unclimbable overhang that separated them from Kurz. They managed to give him a rope long enough to reach them by tying two ropes together. While descending, Kurz could not get the knot to pass through his carabiner. He tried for hours to reach his rescuers who were only a few metres below him. Then he began to lose consciousness. One of the guides, climbing on another's shoulders, was able to touch the tip of Kurz's crampons with his ice-axe but could not reach higher. Kurz was unable to descend further and, completely exhausted, died slowly.|$|E
25|$|At 1030 {{hours on}} the morning of 24 November Seneca hailed Tomoka in {{latitude}} 40° 21.6' North, longitude 73° 49.7' West and ordered her to heave to and be prepared to be boarded and examined. A surfboat with an armed boarding party in charge of Lieutenant L. W. Perkins was sent to go on board and take charge of the vessel. At first Tomoka broke out the British flag and cruised about so that the boarding party would not overtake her. Seneca called her gun crews to quarters, cast <b>loose</b> <b>the</b> number one gun, and then ordered Tomoka to permit the boat to board. The master then complied. At 12:00 the boarding officer reported that he was all right and requested the Seneca to go ahead and he would follow with Tomoka. Seneca shaped a course for the Ambrose Channel lightship, but by 12:30 Tomoka had still not started to follow. Heading back for the rum-runner Seneca was met by her boarding party, which had been chased off Tomoka with a machinegun.|$|E
25|$|Biggs {{followed}} his brother Norman {{when he joined}} Cardiff Rugby Club, the team he would represent throughout his international career. He joined Cardiff during the 1889/90 season {{and the next year}} he was made captain of the club's reserve team. In 1894 he was selected to play for the invitational touring side Barbarian F.C., facing Rockcliff on 2 April. He was first selected to represent Wales in the opening game of the 1895 Home Nations Championship, the very next international after his brother represented Wales for the final time. Biggs was partnered in the half-back role with Llanelli's Ben Davies, himself a new cap; and the first of six partners he would be paired with over his nine match career. His first international was against England in a game played at St. Helens in Swansea. Under the captaincy of Wales rugby superstar Arthur 'Monkey' Gould, Wales lost 3–7, with the English forwards outplaying their Welsh counterparts in the <b>loose.</b> <b>The</b> selectors kept faith with Biggs for the next game of the Championship, away to Scotland, but switched Davies for the more experienced Fred Parfitt. Wales lost this game too, again the forwards could not contend with the opposing side and Biggs and Parfitt were replaced by Morgan of Llanelli and Sweet-Escott of Cardiff in the final game of the tournament.|$|E

500|$|Although Hitler {{presented}} {{no evidence}} of a plot by Röhm to overthrow the regime, he nevertheless denounced the leadership of the SA. Arriving back at party headquarters in Munich, Hitler addressed the assembled crowd. Consumed with rage, Hitler denounced [...] "the worst treachery in world history". Hitler told the crowd that [...] "undisciplined and disobedient characters and asocial or diseased elements" [...] would be annihilated. The crowd, which included party members and many SA members fortunate enough to escape arrest, shouted its approval. Hess, present among the assembled, even volunteered to shoot the [...] "traitors". Joseph Goebbels, who had been with Hitler at Bad Wiessee, set the final phase of the plan in motion.

500|$|During {{the autumn}} of 1660, while the Duke's Company was still getting financed (mostly {{by means of the}} actors buying company shares) and having {{temporary}} quarters set up, the King's Company offered a string of well-received productions. Their new albeit traditional theatre in Vere Street was already fully operational. The devoted playgoer Samuel Pepys called it [...] "the finest playhouse... that ever was in England" [...] in his diary, a sentiment he would need to revise many times over the coming decade, and recorded his awe at seeing Michael Mohun, [...] "who {{is said to be the}} best actor in the world", act on its stage. Davenant was far behind, but daringly put all his capital into the outfitting of a new superior playhouse in Lincoln's Inn Fields (simultaneously, with great foresight, prying <b>loose</b> <b>the</b> rising young star Thomas Betterton from the King's Company), and perfectly hit public taste.|$|E

500|$|Conversely, LA Weekly Manohla Dargis wrote, [...] "It isn't that Spider-Man is {{inherently}} unsuited for live-action translation; it's just that he's not particularly interesting or, well, animated." [...] Giving it 2.5/4 stars, Roger Ebert felt the film lacked a decent action element; [...] "Consider {{the scene where}} Spider-Man is given a cruel choice between saving Mary Jane or a cable car full of school kids. He tries to save both, so that everyone dangles from webbing that seems about to pull <b>loose.</b> <b>The</b> visuals here could have given an impression of the enormous weights and tensions involved, but instead the scene seems more like a bloodless storyboard of the idea." [...] Stylistically, there was heavy criticism of the Green Goblin's costume, which led IGN's Richard George to comment years later, [...] "We're not saying the comic book costume is exactly thrilling, but the Goblin armor (the helmet in particular) from Spider-Man is almost comically bad... Not only is it not frightening, it prohibits expression." ...|$|E
