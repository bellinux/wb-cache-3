40|$|Objective: We {{aimed at}} {{determining}} the prevalence and characterizing the CaPV, determining the CaPV-PPRV coinfection prevalence and providing data about phylogenetic {{relationship between the}} fusion protein of PPRV and P 32 gene of CaPV. Materials and methods: A total of 150 samples including animals swabs, tissues and blood were collected from unvaccinated goats in a PPR and/or Capripox outbreaks in South Kivu, Eastern of Democratic Republic of the Congo. Conventional PCR and reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) were used respectively to amplify P 32, RPO 30, GPCR genes of Capripox virus and Fusion (F) protein of PPRV. Positive samples were sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. Results: Out of 150 tested animals, 64. 7 % (n= 97 / 150) were PPRV positive, 52. 7 % (n= 79 / 150) were Capripox positive and 38. 7 % (n= 58 / 150) were positive for both PPRV and CaPV. The pairwise comparison of P 32 gene of CaPV and F gene of PPRV showed 99. 75 % of identity percentage among goatpox virus sequences, 96. 95 % among PPRV sequences and 47. 91 % between CaPV and PPRV sequences. Conclusion: The study has demonstrated high prevalence of CaP V-PPRV mixed infection in South Kivu. <b>Lumpy</b> <b>skin</b> virus <b>disease</b> (LSVD) is a lineage circulating which has a genetic relationship between its P 32 gene and the F gene of PPRV giving the challenge to differentiate the two diseases at the clinical farm level.

50|$|Capripoxvirus is a genus {{of viruses}} in the {{subfamily}} Chordopoxvirinae {{and the family}} Poxviridae. Capripoxviruses {{are among the most}} serious of all animal poxviruses.

The genus consists of three species: the type species: sheeppox virus (SPPV), goatpox virus (GTPV), and <b>lumpy</b> <b>skin</b> <b>disease</b> virus (LSDV). They share no serological relationship with camel pox, horse pox, or avian poxes. Capripoxviruses for sheeppox and goatpox infect only sheep and goat respectively.

Most instruments measuring the impact of <b>skin</b> <b>disease</b> on quality of life are developed in the west and not applicable to the socio-cultural situation in Nepal. The aim of the study was to develop and validate a questionnaire to measure quality of life impairment due to <b>skin</b> <b>disease</b> in Nepal. Methods: Different aspects of quality of life impairment were identiÞ ed from 35 in-depth interviews and two focus group discussions, with villagers with various <b>skin</b> <b>diseases.</b> Based on this information, 10 questions scoring the influence of <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> on quality of life – <b>Skin</b> <b>Disease</b> Disability Index (SDDI) – was developed. This instrument was tested and validated in 212 villagers with <b>skin</b> <b>disease</b> and in 100 healthy villagers. Results: The maximum total <b>Skin</b> <b>Disease</b> Disability Index score was 36. There was a wide variation in total <b>Skin</b> <b>Disease</b> Disability Index score between individuals with <b>skin</b> <b>disease</b> (range 1 - 33) with a mean score of 13. 2, while in controls the mean total score was 1 (p< 0. 001). Thus, the <b>Skin</b> <b>Disease</b> Disability Index clearly discriminates between these two groups.

Only limited information is available about the frequency of specific <b>skin</b> <b>diseases.</b> We aimed to compare incidence rates of <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> in children in general practice between 1987 and 2001. Methods We used data on all children aged 0 – 17 years derived from two consecutive surveys performed in Dutch general practice in 1987 and 2001. Both surveys concerned a longitudinal registration of GP consultations over 12 months. Each disease episode was coded according to the International Classification of Primary Care. Incidence rates of separate <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> were calculated by dividing all new episodes for each distinct ICPC code by the average study population at risk. Data were stratified for socio-demographic characteristics. Results The incidence rate of all <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> combined in general practice decreased between 1987 and 2001. Among infants the incidence rate increased. Girls presented more <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> to the GP.

We examined the recent prevalence of <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> in a defined population of family medicine patients, self-reported disease-related quality of life, extent and duration of <b>skin</b> <b>disease,</b> and the use of health care by patients with <b>skin</b> <b>diseases.</b> METHODS: We undertook a morbidity registry-based epidemiological study to determine the prevalence of various <b>skin</b> <b>diseases,</b> using a patient questionnaire to inquire about health care use, within a network of family practices in the Netherlands with a practice population of approximately 12, 000 citizens. RESULTS: <b>Skin</b> <b>diseases</b> accounted for 12. 4 % of all diseases seen by the participating family physicians. Of the 857 questionnaires sent to patients registered with a <b>skin</b> <b>disease,</b> 583 (68. 0 %) were returned, and 501 were suitable for analysis. In the previous year, 83. 4 % of the patients had contacted their family physician for their <b>skin</b> <b>disease,</b> 17. 0 % had contacted a medical specialist, and 5. 2 % had consulted an alternative health care practitioner. Overall, 65. 1 % contacted only their family physician. Patients who reported more severe disease and lower quality of life made more use of all forms of health care. CONCLUSION: This practice population-based study found that <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> account for 12. 4 % of diseases seen by family physicians, and that some skin problems may be seen more frequently.

Although insight into physical symptoms accompanying <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> is relevant for the management and treatment of <b>skin</b> <b>diseases,</b> the prevalence of physical symptoms among patients with <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> is a rather unexplored territory. OBJECTIVES: The goal {{of the present study was}} to examine the prevalence of physical {{symptoms of}} itch, pain and fatigue in patients with <b>skin</b> <b>diseases.</b> METHODS: On the basis of a systematic morbidity registration system in primary care, questionnaires were sent to 826 patients with <b>skin</b> <b>diseases.</b> Eventually, questionnaires from 492 patients were suitable for our analyses. RESULTS: Results indicated that patients with <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> particularly experience symptoms of itch and fatigue. Approximately 50 % of all patients report experiencing these symptoms and about 25 % experience these symptoms as relatively severe. Pain was relatively less frequently reported by 23 % of all patients, and was on average somewhat less intense. The physical symptoms showed relatively strong correlations with disease-related quality of life and self-reported disease severity. In contrast, only moderate correlations were found with comorbidity and demographic variables, which suggests that the physical symptoms of itch, pain and fatigue are consequences of the <b>skin</b> <b>diseases.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Itch and fatigue and, to a somewhat lesser extent, pain have a high prevalence among patients with <b>skin</b> <b>diseases.</b> Clinicians should be encouraged to carefully assess itch, pain and fatigue in patients with <b>skin</b> <b>diseases,</b> and where appropriate focus treatment to these symptoms...|$|R

Rinderpest and capripox (<b>lumpy</b> <b>skin</b> <b>disease</b> of cattle, sheep pox and goat pox) cause serious loss of productivity {{and can lead to}} mortality rates that can exceed 90 %. Vaccines have been available to control rinderpest and they are effective, but because of their poor thermal stability in the tropics, they have not led to the eradication of the disease. A capripox vaccine is widely used to vaccinate against sheep and goat pox. It is also effective in protecting cattle against <b>lumpy</b> <b>skin</b> <b>disease.</b> Researchers at the Pirbright Laboratory of the Institute of Animal Health, in the UK, have taken the capripox vaccine and added into it two genes from the rinderpest virus, to create what is known as a recombinant vaccine. These two genes produce proteins which play an important part in developing immunity against rinderpest. The genes are known as the Fusion or F gene, and the Haemagglutinin or H gene. Either the F or H gene are spliced into the genetic make-up of the virus that causes <b>lumpy</b> <b>skin</b> <b>disease,</b> making two recombinant vaccines. These recombinant vaccines continue to protect cattle, sheep and goats against <b>lumpy</b> <b>skin</b> <b>disease</b> as well as producing either the F or H proteins which give protection against rinderpest. Thus one injection will provide protection against both diseases. The researchers have also achieved better shelf-life with the new vaccines than the old rinderpest vaccine.

Nevertheless, little {{research}} {{attention has been paid to}} patients with <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> in the general population, and consequently, little is known about the impact of <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> on daily life within this population. General definitions of health encompass different dimensions of disease outcome divided in disease severity, accompanying physical symptoms, and psychosocial well-being. These dimensions of disease outcome influence the impact of a disease on daily life. Additionally, it is generally assumed that disease outcome interacts with psychological factors. So far, research on disease outcome in patients with <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> has primarily focused on <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> most frequently encountered on dermatological wards, such as atopic dermatitis or psoriasis, leaving unaddressed many types of skin conditions and patients not seen on dermatological wards.
