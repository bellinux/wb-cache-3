5|$|Literature {{also served}} {{religious}} purposes. Beginning with the Pyramid Texts of the Old Kingdom, works of funerary literature written on tomb walls, {{and later on}} coffins, and papyri placed within tombs, were designed to protect and nurture souls in their afterlife. This included the use of magical spells, incantations, and lyrical hymns. Copies of non-funerary <b>literary</b> <b>texts</b> found in non-royal tombs suggest that the dead could entertain themselves in the afterlife by reading these teaching texts and narrative tales.

5|$|While {{the palace}} {{itself has been}} {{completely}} destroyed, {{a significant amount of}} information regarding it has been obtained from contemporary and almost contemporary sources. The Heian Palace figures as a background for action in many Heian period <b>literary</b> <b>texts,</b> both fiction and non-fiction. These provide important information on the palace itself, court ceremonies and functions held there as well as everyday routines of the courtiers living or working there. Notable examples include the Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu, the so-called Pillow Book by Sei Shōnagon and the chronicle Eiga Monogatari. In addition, paintings in certain emakimono picture scrolls depict (sometimes fictional) scenes that took place at the palace; the Genji Monogatari Emaki, dating from about 1130 is perhaps the best-known example. Finally, there are also partially damaged contemporary maps of the palace from the 10th and 12th centuries showing the layout and function of the buildings within Dairi.|$|E

40|$|Within {{the project}} „Literary {{aesthetic}} judgement competence” four single studies and one integrative analysis were conducted, {{in which the}} structure of <b>literary</b> <b>text</b> comprehension was examined and evidence for {{the construct validity of}} a two-dimensional text type specific comprehension model (literary vs. factual) was provided. The evaluation of construct validity was based on differential correlations with convergent and divergent components of several affective (empathy) and motivational (reading motivation, reading self-concept) criteria. In the first study the examination of structural validity of <b>literary</b> <b>text</b> comprehension was of primary importance. According to the theory of aesthetic semiotics, <b>literary</b> <b>text</b> comprehension can be described as an at least two-dimensional construct consisting of semantic and idiolectal demands. Empirical evidence for criterion validity of <b>literary</b> <b>text</b> comprehension was provided by means of differential relationships with external criteria (school grades, factual text comprehension). The second study revealed that the component of emotional fantasy empathy is stronger associated with literary than with factual text comprehension. The results of the third study indicate that experience-related reading motivation and – contrary to the expectation – object-related reading motivation correlate substantially with <b>literary</b> <b>text</b> comprehension. Object-related reading motivation is also associated with factual text comprehension. However, {{this is not the case}} for experience-related reading motivation. Finally in the fourth study, an instrument for measuring the literary and factual reading self-concept was developed and validated. The analyses showed that the literary reading self-concept is only associated with literary and not with factual text comprehension. In contrast, the factual reading self-concept only correlates with factual text comprehension and is not related to <b>literary</b> <b>text</b> comprehension. In an integrative study based on longitudinal data it became evident that the contributions of fantasy empathy and literary reading self-concept to the prediction of <b>literary</b> <b>text</b> comprehension are mediated entirely through the dimensions of intrinsic reading motivation. The studies provide evidence for differential relationships between the understanding of <b>literary</b> and factual <b>texts</b> and individual learner characteristics. Thus, it is justified to consider the understanding of <b>literary</b> and factual <b>texts</b> as distinguishable aspects of reading literacy. Implications for the educational practice and future research efforts are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This article {{proposes to}} rethink the idea that <b>literary</b> <b>text</b> is a closed and selfsufficient system {{by virtue of the}} highly formalized systems that appear in its configuration.

The 118 Martínez Carrizales y Martínez Luna / Leer lo ilegible processes of critical reading authorized by the university institution of literary studies fully assume the systematic character of recognized codes {{in the construction of the}} <b>literary</b> <b>text.</b> On the other hand, in these pages one wishes to propose that <b>literary</b> <b>text</b> is one more constituent of meaning that is radically integrated with other constituent classes – linguistic and non-linguistic, verbal and non-verbal, spoken and unspoken. The idea of radical integration of <b>literary</b> <b>text</b> in a complex process of human communication has developed from a base of the theoretical guidelines of the English linguist Roy Harris, and, in the opinion of this article, would oblige every critical reader to recognize the circumstantial and historical nature of the acts of communication that are integrated in the writing and in the reading of the text...|$|R

25|$|O.M. Starza {{states that}} the Jagannath Ratha Yatra may have evolved from the syncretism of {{procession}} rituals for Siva lingas, Vaishnava pillars, and tribal folk festivities. The Saiva element in the cult of Jagannath overlap with the rites and doctrines of Tantrism and Shaktism Dharma. According to the Saivas, Jagannath is Bhairav. The tantric <b>literary</b> <b>texts</b> identify Jagannath with Mahabhairav. Another evidence that supports syncretism thesis {{is the fact that}} Jagannath sits on the abstract tantric symbols of Sri Yantra. Further, his Sri Chakra ("holy wheel") is worshipped in the Vijamantra 'Klim', which is also the Vijamantra of Kali or Shakti. The representation of Balaram as Sesanaga or Sankarsana bears testimony to the influence of Shaivism on the cult of Jagannath. The third deity, Devi Subhadra, who represents the Sakti element is still worshipped with the Bhuvaneshwari Mantra.|$|E
