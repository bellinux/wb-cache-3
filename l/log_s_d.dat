40|$|In {{a celebrated}} result Linial et al. [3] gave an {{algorithm}} which learns size-s depth-d AND/OR/NOT circuits in (<b>log</b> <b>s)</b> <b>d</b> time n from uniformly distributed random examples on the Boolean cube { 0, 1 } n. Kharitonov [2] subsequently gave compelling {{evidence that the}} Linial et al. algorithm (log s) o(d) is essentially optimal, by showing that an n-time algorithm for learning size-s depth-d circuits under uniform would contradict a plausible cryptographic assumption about the hardness of integer factorization. We give the first algorithm for learning a more expressive circuit class than the class AC 0 considered by Linial et al. and Kharitonov. The new algorithm learns constant-depth AND/OR/NOT circuits augmented with (a limited number of) majority gates. Our main positive result for these circuits can be stated informally as follows (a precise statement is given in [1]) : Theorem 1 Quasipolynomial (n polylog n) size constantdepth circuits which contain a polylogarithmic number of majority gates can be learned under the uniform distribution in quasipolynomial time from random examples only. As we allow constant depth circuits to contain more and more majority gates we move toward the circuit complexity class TC 0 which {{can be viewed as}} AC 0 augmented with a polynomial number of majority gates. TC 0 is a highly expressive class which {{is not likely to be}} efficiently learnable. We establish the following lower bound for learning augmented AC 0 circuits which holds under Kharitonov’s plausible cryptographic assumption (a precise statement is given in [1]) : Theorem 2 Any algorithm that even weakly learns depth- 5 circuits containing more than a polylogarithmic number of majority gates under the uniform distribution must run in more than quasipolynomial time, even if membership queries are allowed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} a number of {{variables}} on heat transfer from town gas flames to horizontal water jacketed tubes was investigated. Aerated and non-aerated flames inside 2. 00 " and 4. 16 " internal diameter tubes were studied. The variables were as follows:- The total heat transfer rate was obtained from the flow rate and temperature rise of the water in the jackets. An estimate of the radiant heat transfer was made by means of radiation pyrometer measurements. Pressure loss was also studied. The results were correlated by analysis of variance and it was found that overall heat transfer was dependent on heat input, tube length, % Excess air and tube diameter only. Little difference was found between aerated and non-aerated flames, and the results for these two could be combined with little sacrifice of accuracy.

All logs were sawn to 25 -mm boards using a standard conversion procedure in a single-band sawmill at Rotorua. The produce was graded according to commercial grades and provisional Clear and Clear-cutting grade classifications. Conversion factors increased with increasing log size and decreased with increasing sweep. A change in the sweep: diameter ratio (deviation: small-end diameter (<b>s.</b> e. <b>d.))</b> of 0. 1 was associated with an average drop in timber recovery of about 5 %.

One patient was secondarily excluded at this stage because of a placebo response and one patient dropped out for personal reasons. The remaining 20 patients were randomized to receive either nifedipine 20 mg twice a day or mefruside 25 mg once a day in a classical two-period crossover design with 8 -week treatment periods separated by a 4 -week single-blind placebo washout. During 8 weeks nifedipine therapy the mean supine blood pressure was reduced from 173 (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> = 15. 4) / 107 (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> = 6. 4) mmHg to 150 (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> = 16. 7) / 93 (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> = 10. 8) mmHg whereas the corresponding reduction for mefruside was from 174 (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> = 15. 9) / 107 (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> = 9. 4) mmHg to 153 (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> = 19. 1) / 94 (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> = 9. 7) mmHg.

40|$|Some feed {{ingredients}} bind more acid in {{the stomach}} than others {{and for this reason}} may be best omitted from pig starter foods if gastric acidity is to be promoted. The objective {{of this study was to}} measure the acid-binding capacity (ABC) of ingredients commonly used in pig starter foods. Ingredients were categorised as follows: (i) milk products (n = 6), (ii) cereals (n = 10), (iii) root and pulp products (n = 5), (iv) vegetable proteins (n = 11), (v) meat and fish meal (n = 2), (vi) medication (n = 3), (vii) amino acids (n = 4), (viii) minerals (n = 16), (ix) acid salts (n = 4), (x) acids (n = 10). A 0. 5 g sample of food was suspended in 50 ml distilled de-ionised water with continuous stirring. This suspension was titrated with 0. 1 mol/L HCl or 0. 1 mol/L NaOH so that approximately 10 additions of titrant was required to reach pH 3. 0. The pH readings after each addition were recorded following equilibration for three minutes. ABC was calculated as the amount of acid in milliequivalents (meq) required to lower the pH of 1 kg food to (a) pH 4. 0 (ABC- 4) and (b) pH 3. 0 (ABC- 3). Categories of food had significantly different (P < 0. 01) ABC values.

Within category, ABC- 3 and ABC- 4 values were highly correlated: R 2 values of 0. 80 and greater for food categories i, iv, v, vi, vii and viii. The correlation between predicted and observed ABC values of 34 mixed diets was 0. 83 for ABC- 4 and 0. 71 for ABC- 3. It was concluded that complete diets with low ABC values may be formulated through careful selection of ingredients.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{left ventricular}} (LV) function and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) {{in patients with}} axial SpA in relationship to underlying disease severity. METHODS: We recruited 104 patients with axial SpA and 50 controls. Detailed transthoracic echocardiography was performed and analysed with two-dimensional speckle tracking strain analysis for systolic function and tissue Doppler-derived E/E' for diastolic function assessment. Carotid IMT was measured by ultrasonography to evaluate subclinical atherosclerosis. Radiological severity of patients with axial SpA was assessed by the modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Score (mSASSS). RESULTS: Despite a similar LV ejection fraction [62. 7 % (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> 3. 9) vs 62. 8 % (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> 3. 8), P = 0. 83], patients with axial SpA had impaired LV myocardial longitudinal strain (LS), circumferential strain (CS) and radial strain (RS) compared with controls [- 18. 1 % (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> 2. 4) vs - 20. 1 % (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> 2. 5), - 17. 2 % (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> 2. 2) vs - 20. 3 % (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> 2. 9) and 37. 1 % (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> 8. 6) vs 43. 2 % (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> 10. 9), respectively; all P < 0. 01]. In addition, patients with axial SpA had a greater E/E' [7. 9 (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> 2. 5) vs 7. 0 (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> 1. 7), P < 0. 01] and carotid IMT [0. 78 mm (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> 0. 19) vs 0. 69 mm (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> 0. 10), P < 0. 01] than controls. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, axial SpA remained independently associated with LV myocardial strains, E/E' and carotid IMT. Importantly, multivariate linear regression analysis demonstrated that mSASSS was independently associated with LV longitudinal strain, E/E' and carotid IMT. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that patients with axial SpA had impaired LV systolic and diastolic function and increased carotid IMT. Importantly, mSASSS was independently associated with LV longitudinal strain, E/E' and carotid IMT after adjusting for confounding factors.

A worksite-based intervention program on SRH-related knowledge, attitude and practice (SRH KAP) modification may be an effective approach to improve the SRH status among migrant workers. This study aimed to identify better intervention approaches via the implementation and evaluation of two intervention packages. Methods: A worksite-based cluster-randomised intervention study was conducted from June to December 2008 in eight factories in Guangzhou, China. There were 1346 female migrant workers {{who participated in this}} study. Factories were randomly allocated to the standard package of interventions group (SPIG) or the intensive package of interventions group (IPIG). Questionnaires were administered to evaluate the effect of two interventions. Results: SRH knowledge scores were higher at follow up than at baseline for all participants of the SPIG; the knowledge scores increased from 6. 50 (standard deviation (<b>s.</b> <b>d.)</b> 3. 673) to 8. 69 (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> 4. 085), and from 5. 98 (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> 3. 581) to 11. 14 (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> 3. 855) for IPIG; SRH attitude scores increased among unmarried women: the attitude scores changed from 4. 25 (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> 1. 577) to 4. 46 (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> 1. 455) for SPIG, and from 3. 99 (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> 1. 620) to 4. 64 (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> 1. 690) for IPIG; most SRH-related practice was also modified (P < 0. 05). In addition, after intervention, the IPIG had a higher knowledge level than the SPIG; the scores were 11. 14 (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> 3. 855) versus 8. 69 (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> 4. 085), and unmarried women in the IPIG had higher condom use rate than the SPIG (86. 4 % versus 57. 1 %). Conclusions: The interventions had positive influences on improvements in SRH knowledge, attitudes and behaviours. Additionally, IPIs were more effective than SPIs, indicating that a comprehensive intervention may achieve better results...|$|R
40|$|Summary Systemically {{administered}} radiolabelled anti-tumour antibody is {{ineffective in}} treating {{the majority of}} patients with liver metastasis from colorectal carcinoma. We have assessed whether agents which increase capillary permeability can increase tumour uptake of antibody isotope conjugate. We developed a xenograft model of colorectal carcinoma using an antibody directed against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Tumours were grown subcutaneously in the hind limbs of athymic rats to derive their circulation from the femoral artery. Cannulae {{were placed in the}} common iliac artery and iliolumbar vein. Antibody was delivered systemically, regionally and regionally with histamine, leukotriene C 4 and interleukin- 2. Regionally administered anti-CEA antibody resulted in a significantly greater (P = 0. 004) tumour to normal tissue ratio (1. 66, <b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> = 0. 68) compared to systemically administered antibody (1. 25, <b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> = 0. 73). The addition of vasoactive drugs produced an approximately 3 -fold increase with an increase to a mean tumour:liver ratio of 3. 24 (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> = 1. 39) for histamine (P < 0. 001 compared to systemic delivery), 3. 21 (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> = 1. 13, P < 0. 001) for leukotriene C 4 and 3. 80 (<b>s.</b> <b>d.</b> = 1. 53, P < 0. 001) for interleukin- 2.

Instrumental mass bias effects and isotope fractionation during W separation are corrected for {{by means of}} a 180 W- 183 W double-spike added prior to sample dissolution. The separation of W from matrix is achieved via three-step anion-exchange chromatography. Tungsten stable isotopic compositions were determined by multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICPMS). Results are expressed relative to the NIST SRM 3136 W standard as the permil difference in 186 W/ 184 W ( 186 W).
