50|$|Jack Mosley (Bruce Willis) is an alcoholic, burned-out N.Y.P.D. detective. Despite a late {{shift the}} night before, his {{lieutenant}} orders him to escort a witness, Eddie Bunker (Mos Def), from <b>local</b> <b>custody</b> {{to the courthouse}} 16 blocks away to testify on a police corruption case {{before a grand jury}} at 10 a.m. Bunker tries to be friendly with Mosley, telling him of his aspirations to move to Seattle to become a cake baker with his sister who he has never met, but Mosley is uninterested, and stops at a liquor store. They are suddenly ambushed by a gunman, and Mosley drags Bunker to a local bar to take shelter and call for backup. Mosley's former partner, Frank Nugent (David Morse), and several other officers arrive. Nugent and his men are part of the corruption scheme, and he tells Mosley that Bunker is not worth defending as his testimony will likely out several officers with dirty hands, including Nugent. The corrupt cops try to frame Bunker for firing at an officer before they try to kill him. Mosley intervenes, rescuing Bunker and fleeing.|$|E

In September of 1962, after failing in several {{attempts}} to prevent {{the integration of the}} University of Mississippi, Gov. Ross Barnett hatched one final plan. He would have would-be student James Meredith arrested on a trumped-up charge of voter fraud, leaving the African American in <b>local</b> police <b>custody</b> and unavailable to be escorted by federal marshals to Ole Miss in Oxford. This plan was foiled when state attorney general Joe Patterson (1956 – 1969) informed U. S. attorney general Robert Kennedy and his deputy Burke Marshall of the plan to arrest Meredith, and thus cleared the way for his registration and the deadly riot that followed...|$|R

50|$|Overseeing 15 {{resident}} prostitutes, Noyce {{was able}} to draw on up to 25 other women in busy periods. Her employees apparently had regular health checks. Queues formed around the block when certain ships were in port. When the aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy was in dock at Leith, the women reportedly did £4,000 of business in one night and the ship's captain declared the house off-limits. Noyce was charged 47 times for living off immoral earnings, generally paid the fine instantly, and served a four-month prison sentence in 1972, her last period in <b>custody.</b> <b>Local</b> councillors commented that they received more complaints when Noyce was in prison because her business was less well managed.|$|R
50|$|There {{are reports}} that {{security}} forces may abuse detainees and, in some instances, use torture. The government acknowledged that violent abuse usually occurred during preliminary investigations conducted at police stations or military installations, in which suspects were interrogated without an attorney. Such abuse occurred despite laws that prevented judges from accepting any confession extracted under duress. Methods of torture reportedly included beatings and suspension by arms tied behind the back. Some detainees were beaten, handcuffed, blindfolded, and forced to lie {{face down on the}} ground. One person died in <b>custody.</b> <b>Local</b> journalists and human rights organizations were not given access to the Yarze prison, which is controlled by the Ministry of Defense. A French report describes the methods of torture used in this prison.|$|R

5000|$|In {{early spring}} of 1775 HMS Canceaux was {{actively}} patrolling the coastline of New England {{in an attempt}} to prevent smuggling and enforce British law. She anchored in Casco Bay in March to prevent colonists from enforcing the First Continental Congress boycott of all goods from Britain. The militia of Brunswick, Maine controlled by Samuel Thompson, endeavored to drive the ship and her crew from the region in order to regain their authority within the city. After a militia boarding party in small boats had been deterred by grapeshot from Canceaux cannon, the local militia changed tack. Rather than targeting the entire ship and her crew they narrowed their sights upon the ship’s commander Lieutenant Henry Mowat. While the Lieutenant endeavored to arrange church services for his crew he was kidnapped and held by Thompson’s militia. This obvious affront to the authority of the British Navy and this crew in particular engendered ire amongst the crew and loyalist population alike. The highest ranking officer remaining aboard Canceaux, the first lieutenant, threatened the local populace to release Mowat or else they would begin to shell the city. The crew initially discharged the cannon loaded only with gunpowder, but no shot, in a veiled threat to the surrounding people. This threat was met by Thompson with the claim that for each shell fired at Falmouth, Mowat would lose a finger. By now the cannon fire had attracted local minutemen to Falmouth where they proceeded to loot the homes and valuables of loyalists residing in the city. The confrontation was eventually resolved as the local populace convinced Thompson to release the British commander. Mowat returned to Canceaux but was unable to take any <b>locals</b> into <b>custody</b> for his abduction, a reality that infuriated the commander. She eventually departed from Casco Bay to return to Boston to resume her typical activities of patrolling to preventing smuggling and enforcing British maritime law.|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire for the degree of Professional Doctorate in Youth JusticeFor a brief moment in the 1980 s, a number of local authorities across England and Wales declared themselves ‘custody free zones’ (Rutherford, 2002), symbolising an intent that children should not be incarcerated for their offending behaviour within the local authority boundary. While this lofty aspiration was not always fulfilled, on occasion it was. More importantly, such declarations {{can be seen as}} manifestations of a widespread commitment, extending well beyond those ‘zones’, to the idea that the use of custody for children should be avoided wherever possible. During the course of the decade, that commitment found expression in an unprecedented fall in the number of young people deprived of their liberty by the criminal courts. The 1990 s proved to be very different. A sea-change in the treatment of children in conflict with the law led to an escalation in custody every bit as sharp as the decline that had preceded it. This thesis seeks to explain that shift {{in order to understand the}} implications for practice if the imprisonment of children is to be reduced. The explanatory account is set against a longer term background of social, economic and political change that yielded what Garland (2002) has characterised as the ‘crisis of penal modernism’. It invokes what Foucault (1991) calls a ‘history of the present’ in which patterns of incarceration since the late 1960 s are analysed to shed light on the systemic determinants of the current high level of youth <b>custody.</b> <b>Local</b> variations in the use of child imprisonment are also interrogated in the context of the historical experience to ascertain the nature of political, systemic and cultural factors that are consistent with lower rates of detention. The thesis concludes that the recent rise in custody cannot be understood in isolation: the same underlying dynamic that fuelled the carceral explosion impacted equally on other aspects of the youth justice system; and necessitated a significant cultural shift on the part of the those who might previously have been expected to resist the use of detention. Without an understanding of these corresponding changes, strategies for custody reduction that rely heavily on the provision of ‘robust’ community based alternatives, or those that seek to reduce the population of the secure estate simply by ‘nipping in the bud’ (Straw, 1997) children’s offending, are unlikely to lead to the desired outcome...|$|R
