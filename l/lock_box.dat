We're having bully times in 'Frisco, you bet! though there ain't {{anything}} wild worth shucks to go to see--'cept the sea lions at the Cliff House. They're just stunning--big as a grizzly, and bigger--climbing over a big rock or swimming in the sea like an otter or muskrat. I'm sending you some snells and hooks, such as you can't get at Casket. Use the fine ones for pot-holes and the bigger ones for running water or falls. Let me know when you've got 'em. Write to <b>Lock</b> <b>Box</b> No. 1290. That's where dad's letters come. So no more at present.|$|E

It is somewhat analogous to weapons systems that require two individuals to turn two different keys in order to enable the system. One person cannot do it alone. Another example is to consider access to a <b>lock</b> <b>box</b> in a bank. That access requires multiple parties, one the <b>lock</b> <b>box</b> owner and another a bank official. Both individuals act together to access the <b>lock</b> <b>box,</b> while neither could do so alone.

We relax the security properties usually required from <b>locked</b> <b>boxes</b> (such as in bit-commitment protocols) and require only that a broken lock or torn envelope be identifiable to the original sender. Unlike the completely impregnable <b>locked</b> <b>box,</b> this functionality may be achievable in real life, where containers having this property are called "tamper-evident seals". Another physical object with this property is the "scratch-off card", often used in lottery tickets. We show that scratch-off cards {{can be used to}} implement bitcommitment and coin flipping, but not oblivious transfer. Of particular interest, we give a strongly-fair coin flipping protocol with bias bounded by O(1 /r) (where r is the number of rounds), beating the best known bias in the standard model even with cryptographic assumptions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this article, {{we attempt}} to {{formally}} study two very intuitive physical models: sealed envelopes and <b>locked</b> <b>boxes,</b> often used as illustrations for common cryptographic operations. We relax the security properties usually required from <b>locked</b> <b>boxes</b> [such as in bit-commitment (BC) protocols] and require only that a broken lock or torn envelope be identifiable to the original sender. Unlike the completely impregnable <b>locked</b> <b>box,</b> this functionality may be achievable in real life, where containers having this property are called “tamper-evident seals”.  Another physical object with this property is the “scratch-off card”, often used in lottery tickets. We consider three variations of tamper-evident seals, and show that under some conditions {{they can be used}} to implement oblivious transfer, BC and coin flipping (CF). We also show a separation between the three models. One of our results is a strongly fair CF protocol with bias bounded by O(1 /r) (where r is the number of rounds); this was a stepping stone towards achieving such a protocol in the standard model (in subsequent work) ...|$|R
