5|$|To get to {{the high}} profile Esterbrook, Peter makes a deal with Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), who tells him where to find Claire before she {{can be turned into}} a {{radioactive}} bomb. The FBI storms the building, and Olivia is able to give Claire the cure before her head explodes. Estebrook arrogantly tells Olivia his <b>lawyers</b> <b>will</b> spring him out of any trouble, and she publicly arrests him to ensure the press finds out, causing his company's stock to dramatically decrease in value. After Broyles lectures her, Olivia tells him her emotions (which she had exhibited strongly all episode) make her a better agent.|$|E
2500|$|New York Times reporters Neil Lewis and David Stout {{estimated}} subsequently that Libby's {{prison sentence}} could begin within [...] "two months", explaining that Judge Walton’s decision {{means that the}} defense <b>lawyers</b> <b>will</b> probably ask {{a federal appeals court}} to block the sentence, a long-shot move. It also sharpens interest in a question being asked by Mr. Libby’s supporters and critics alike: Will President Bush pardon Mr. Libby? ... So far, the president has expressed sympathy for Mr. Libby and his family but has not tipped his hand on the pardon issue. ... If the president does not pardon him, and if an appeals court refuses to second-guess Judge Walton’s decision, Mr. Libby will probably be ordered to report to prison in six to eight weeks' time. Federal prison authorities will decide where. [...] "Unless the Court of Appeals overturns my ruling, he will have to report", Judge Walton said.|$|E
2500|$|Nor is {{advertising}} {{by lawyers}} inherently misleading. [...] The Court {{speculated that the}} [...] "only services that lend themselves to advertising are the routine ones," [...] precisely the services that Bates and O'Steen were advertising. [...] "Although the precise service demanded in each task may vary slightly, and although legal services are not fungible, these facts do not make advertising misleading {{so long as the}} attorney does the necessary work at the advertised price. [...] The argument that legal services are so unique that fixed rates cannot meaningfully be established is refuted by the record in this case: [...] The State Bar itself sponsors a Legal Services Program in which the participating attorneys agree to perform services like those advertised by the appellants at standardized rates." [...] And although advertising for legal services is necessarily incomplete — responsible <b>lawyers</b> <b>will,</b> of course, disclaim that all cases are [...] "simple" [...] ones — a rough estimate of the cost is more useful to the public than keeping them in the dark entirely.|$|E

60|$|BRODIE. (I am sorry, Procurator, but I must {{be short}} with you.) You are {{talking in the}} air, as <b>lawyers</b> <b>will.</b> I prefer to drop the subject (and it will displease me if you return to it in my hearing).|$|E
