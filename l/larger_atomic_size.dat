It was observed that in-spite of a <b>larger</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>size,</b> Fe tend to diffuse more rapidly than smaller N atoms. This only happens in the N-rich region of Fe-N phase diagram, in the N-poor regions, N diffusion coefficient is orders of magnitude larger than Fe. Detailed self-diffusion measurements performed in FeN thin films reveal that the diffusion mechanism of Fe and N is different - Fe atoms diffuse through a complex process, which {{in addition to a}} volume diffusion, pre-dominantly controlled by a fast grain boundary diffusion. On the other hand N atoms diffuse through a classical volume-type diffusion process.

As such, investigation of spin state changes in Fe-bearing MgGeO$_ 3 $ might help to clarify some aspects of this type of state change in Fe-bearing MgSiO$_ 3 $. Using DFT+U calculations, we have investigated pressure induced spin state changes in Fe$^{ 2 +}$ and Fe$^{ 3 +}$ in MgGeO$_ 3 $ perovskite and post-perovskite. Owing to the relatively <b>larger</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>size</b> of germanium compared to silicon, germanate phases have larger unit cell volume and inter-atomic distances than equivalent silicate phases at same pressures. As a result, all pressure induced state changes in iron occur at higher pressures in germanate phases than in the silicate ones, be it a spin state change or position change of (ferrous) iron in the perovskite cage. We showed that iron state transitions occur at particular average Fe-O bond-length irrespective of mineral composition (silicate or germanate) or functionals (LDA+U$_{sc}$ or GGA+U$_{sc}$). Ferrous iron substitution decreases the perovskite to post-perovskite (PPv) transition pressure while coupled ferric iron substitution increases it noticeably.

During melting, elemental segregation occurs due to Stokes’ law and then inevitably affects glass formation. In this paper, such effects on glass-forming ability in a TiCu-based alloy system have been demonstrated. In the bulk glass-forming composition Ti 43 Cu 42 Hf 14 Si 1, macroscopic segregation of Si was observed in the as-melted ingots and silicon was completely depleted in the as-cast rods.

In the present density functional theory based work, we design HMAs from the extremely dissimilar GaP (semiconductor) and GaBi (semi-metal). The alloying of the two compounds with unmatched electronic characteristics has triggered a rapid reduction in the energy gap of GaPBi. The energy gap is reduced by 39. 3 meV for every 1 % increase in Bi composition. The semiconductor behavior of GaPBi based HMAs {{is found to be}} transformed to semi-metallic for replacing 64. 6 % of P atoms by Bi. Unlike the conventional alloys, the variation in the electronic energy gap of GaP 1 -xBix shows deviation from the Vegard's formalism.

In spite of several experimental investigations, {{there is a lack}} of a thorough understanding of the underlying surface dynamic processes and their interplay. In this work, a rate equation model is developed including several physically sound surface processes such as segregation from the crystalline layer to a surface riding In segregated layer and incorporation from the segregated In layer to crystalline layer. The rate of the processes are assumed Arrhenius-type with concentration-dependent activation energies. The simulated In incorporation coefficient versus substrate temperature is in excellent agreement with experimental data [I] for various As overpressure. For a constant As overpressure, In incorporation decreases with increasing temperature. For a constant temperature, In incorporation increases with increasing As overpressure, The In desorption versus time results from experiments and our simulation match very well. The desorption process has two components, one arising from the physisorbed layer of In and the other from the surface of the crystal. The activation energy for these processes for an isolated In atom are 0. 18 and 2. 6 eV, respectively. These observations are explained based on the interplay of competing surface processes such as segregation and incorporation...|$|E

Several basis sets, namely, 3 - 21 G, 3 - 21 G*, and 6 - 31 G*, are used. Specific systems considered here are C 60 - 2 x(BN/AlN) x where x varies from 1 to 3. Both similarities and dissimilarities have been noticed in the substitution patterns between BN− and AlN−fullerenes. Some of the rules already established in BN substitution patterns are followed by its AlN counterpart. For example, like BN, AlN units prefer to stay together. However, the prominent “hexagon filling rule” of BN−fullerenes is disobeyed by AlN. Its <b>larger</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>size</b> and the weak nature of the Al−N and Al−C π-interaction may be the reason for such discrepancies. AlN substitution causes much more distortion of total electron density of C 60 than its BN counterpart, making the fullerene easier to oxidize and reduce. The HOMO−LUMO gap (band gap) strongly depends on the number of substituent units, and the changes are minimal for the BN system in comparison to its compeer.

We investigate the Zr-Cu alloy system {{as well as a}} simple model for binary alloys, in which we can change the <b>atomic</b> <b>size</b> ratio between alloying components. In both cases, we found the same nature of icosahedral order in liquid and glassy phases. The icosahedral clusters are observed in liquid phases as well as in glassy phases. As the temperature approaches to the glass transition point Tg, the density of the clusters rapidly grows and the icosahedral clusters begin to connect to each other and form a medium-range network structure. By investigating the geometry of connection between clusters in the icosahedral network, we found that the dominant connecting pattern is the one sharing seven atoms which forms a pentagonal bicap with five-fold symmetry. From a geometrical point of view, we can understand the mechanism of the formation and growth of the icosahedral order by using the Regge calculus, which is originally employed to formulate a theory of gravity.

The quantities are corrected for magnetostrains due to sample geometry (the magnetostrictive form effect). Recently published elastic constant data along with magnetization measurements at both room temperature and 77 [*]K make these corrections possible. The form effect correction lowers the magnetostriction by ∼ 10 [*]ppm for high-modulus alloys and {{by as much as}} 30 [*]ppm for low-modulus alloys. The elastic constants are also used to determine the values of the magnetoelastic coupling constant, b 1. With the new magnetostriction data on the Fe-Al-Ga alloy, it is possible to show how the double peak magnetostriction feature of the binary Fe-Ga alloy flows into the single peak binary Fe-Al alloy. The corrected magnetostriction and magnetoelastic coupling data for the various alloys are also compared using the electron-per-atom ratio, e/a, as the common variable. The Hume-Rothery rules link thee/a ratio to the regions of phase stability, which appear to be intimately related to the magnetostriction versus the solute concentration curve in these alloys.

This work was {{performed with the}} objective of establishing a mechanistic understanding of four RE elements from the lanthanide series on the high temperature oxidation and mechanical behavior of Ni-base superalloys. Oxidation behavior was studied by subjecting the alloys to isothermal and cyclic oxidation exposure in the temperature range of 1000 - 1200 C for a span of 1000 - 10, 000 hours. The RE additions were beneficial in retarding the oxidation kinetics and increasing the scale adherence under thermal cycling conditions. It was proposed that segregation of RE ions to the ?-Al 2 O 3 grain boundaries inhibited the outward diffusion of oxygen active elements like Al, Ti etc. Due to this segregation, the oxidation reaction progressed predominantly by the inward diffusion of oxygen and lead to reduction in the scale growth rate. The segregation tendency was attributed to their larger ionic radii and higher thermodynamic affinity towards oxygen. Studies conducted on CM 247 LC alloy with a TBC (YSZ + MCrAlY) system also revealed the beneficial effects of the RE additions in improving the spallation lifetimes of YSZ by 20 % in the temperature range of 1050 - 1150 C, by reducing the growth rate of thermally grown oxide layers. The segregation behavior was characterized using Auger Spectroscopy, SIMS, TEM and SEM. Mechanical behavior of the RE modified CM 247 LC alloys were also studied through tensile and creep testing in the temperature range of 650 - 950 C. RE elements lead to increase in the steady state creep rate with reduced creep rupture lifetimes. A change in the fracture behavior occurred from mixed mode to completely inter-granular at temperatures > 800 C, due to RE additions. The temperature dependence of the creep deformation mechanisms in RE modified was evaluated.

The formation of core–shell structures in a one-step fabrication process implies that the heterostructure is formed via a self organization process by a spontaneous phase separation in the Er–Si–O alloy system. As suggested in our previous study, the formation of the core–shell seems driven by the different solubility of Er between liquid catalyst and solid NWs. In the VLS mechanism, both Si and Er are supplied to the catalyst in supersaturation. Since Er and Si have solubility to Pt or Au [20, 21], respectively, Er can precipitate at the interface between the catalyst and the growing NWs.

40|$|Abstract: Metallurgy {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} sciences. Its history can be traced back to 6000 BCE with the {{discovery}} of Gold, and each new discovery — Copper, Silver, Lead, Tin, Iron and Mercury — marked the beginning of a new era of civilization. Currently there are 86 known metals, but until the end of the 17 th century, only 12 of these were known. Steel (Fe–C alloy) was discovered in the 11 th century BCE; however, it took until 1709 CE before we mastered the smelting of pig-iron by using coke instead of charcoal and started the industrial revolution. The metallurgy of nowadays is mainly about discovering better materials with superior properties to fulfil the increasing demand of the global market. Promising are the Glassy Metals or Bulk Metallic Glasses (BMGs) — discovered at first in the late 50 s at the California Institute of Technology — which are several times stronger than the best industrial steels and 10 -times springier. The unusual structure that lacks crystalline grains makes BMGs so promising. They have a liquid-like structure that means they melt at lower temperatures, can be moulded nearly as easily as plastics, and can be shaped into features just 10 nm across. The best BMG formers are based on Zr, Pd, Pt, Ca, Au and, recently discovered, also Fe. They have typically three to five components with <b>large</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>size</b> mismatch and a composition close to a deep eutectic.

Combined electron-microscopy techniques and atom probe tomography reveal how the improved creep properties result from Au precipitation within the creep cavities, preferentially formed on grain boundaries oriented perpendicular to the applied stress. The selective precipitation of Au atoms at the free creep cavity surface results in pore filling, and thereby, autonomous repair of the creep damage. The <b>large</b> difference in <b>atomic</b> <b>size</b> between the Au and Fe strongly hampers the nucleation of precipitates in the matrix. As a result, the matrix acts as a reservoir for the supersaturated solute until damage occurs.

Evidence for the incorporation of Dy into the lattice is provided by X-ray diffraction and increased orientation-dependent local fields detected by 125 Te NMR spectroscopy. Since Dy has a stable electronic configuration, the enhancement cannot be attributed to 4 f -electron states formed near the Fermi level.

We study the effect of <b>atomic</b> <b>size</b> ratio and <b>atomic</b> stiffness parameter (related to the curvature of the interatomic potential) on deformation stability of binary glasses using molecular static simulations. The deformation stability of a glass is found to increase with increasing <b>atomic</b> <b>size</b> ratio and magnitude of the atomic stiffness, which is proportional to the bulk modulus of the pure crystalline system, as well as the ratio of atomic stiffnesses of constituent atoms. To understand the role of the above parameters on deformation stability, misfit energies of randomly substituted solid solution fcc crystals and glasses are compared for various <b>atomic</b> <b>size</b> ratios and <b>atomic</b> stiffness values. Unlike in fcc solid solution, the misfit energy of binary glasses is found to be insensitive to the <b>atomic</b> <b>size</b> ratio. It is also found that the packing fraction of glasses is insensitive to the <b>atomic</b> <b>size</b> ratio, consistent with the above result. Beyond a critical <b>atomic</b> <b>size</b> ratio, the misfit energy of fcc solid solution exceeds the energy of the glass, thus making the amorphous state completely stable to deformation induced crystallization. Our analysis shows that critical <b>atomic</b> <b>size</b> ratio decreases with increasing atomic stiffness which leads to an increase in the deformation stability of glasses...|$|R

Solid solution phases form and only form when {{the requirements of}} the <b>atomic</b> <b>size</b> difference, mixing enthalpy and mixing entropy are all met. The most significant difference between the solid solution forming high entropy alloys and bulk metallic glasses lies in the <b>atomic</b> <b>size</b> difference. These rules provide valuable guidance for the future development of high entropy alloys and bulk metallic glasses...|$|R
40|$|The Ag-Ni {{system is}} {{characterized}} by <b>large</b> differences in <b>atomic</b> <b>sizes</b> (14 %) and a positive heat of mixing (+ 23 kJ mol(- 1)). The binary equilibrium diagram for this system therefore exhibits a large miscibility gap in both solid and liquid state. This paper explores the size-dependent changes in microstructure and {{the suppression of the}} miscibility gap which occurs when free alloy particles of nanometer size are synthesized by co-reduction of Ag and Ni metal precursors. The paper reports that complete mixing between Ag and Ni atoms could be achieved for smaller nanoparticles (< 7 nm). These particles exhibit a single-phase solid solution with face-centered cubic (fcc) structure. With increase in size, the nanoparticles revealed two distinct regions. One of the regions is composed of pure Ag. This region partially surrounds a region of fcc solid solution at an early stage of decomposition. Experimental observations were compared with the results obtained from the thermodynamic calculations, which compared the free energies corresponding to a physical mixture of pure Ag and Ni phases and a fcc Ag-Ni solid solution for different particle sizes. Results from the theoretical calculations revealed that, for the Ag-Ni system, solid solution was energetically preferred over the physical mixture configuration for particle sizes of 7 nm and below. The experimentally observed two-phase microstructure for larger particles was thus primarily due to the growth of Ag-rich regions epitaxially on initially formed small fcc Ag-Ni nanoparticles.

40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of {{stress on the}} distribution of slow-diffusing substitutional impurities in the vicinity of a dislocation loop in Si and Ge bulk was theoretically investigated, at the atomic scale, using the Si and Ge Stillinger-Weber potentials via Monte Carlo and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. The dislocation loop was modeled by an extra atomic plane introduced between two (111) planes. The calculations were performed at high temperature, for which impurity diffusion was enabled. The {{influence of}} <b>atomic</b> <b>size</b> effect on Cottrell atmosphere formation was investigated considering the difference of atomic volume between Si and Ge. The dislocation loop elastic field was found to prevent the accumulation of substitutional atoms {{in the vicinity of the}} dislocation. However, the calculations suggest that substitutional impurities can occupy interstitial sites close to the dislocation loop. In this case, the elastic field surrounding the dislocation loop can promote Cottrell atmosphere formation mainly if the impurity exhibits a <b>larger</b> <b>atomic</b> radius than the matrix atoms (Si or Ge).

40|$|We present {{scanning}} tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy measurements at 100 mK in the {{superconducting material}} 2 H-NbSe 2 that show well defined features in the superconducting density of states changing in a pattern closely following atomic periodicity. Our experiment demonstrates that the intrinsic superconducting density of states can show <b>atomic</b> <b>size</b> modulations, which reflect the reciprocal space structure of the superconducting gap. In particular we obtain that the superconducting gap of 2 H-NbSe 2 has six fold modulated components at 0. 75 mV and 1. 2 mV. Moreover, we also find related <b>atomic</b> <b>size</b> modulations inside vortices, demonstrating that the much discussed star shape vortex structure produced by localized states inside the vortex cores, has a, hitherto undetected, superposed <b>atomic</b> <b>size</b> modulation. The tip substrate interaction in an anisotropic superconductor has been calculated, giving position dependent changes related to the observed gap anisotropy. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures.
