2500|$|Few <b>lawmakers</b> <b>are</b> as honest, principled and {{consistent}} as Brinkman. But he exhibits those qualities to a fault, coming off as stubborn, ideologically rigid {{and unwilling to}} compromise. He's made many enemies in Columbus by refusing to see anyone else's side of things. This has limited his ability to work with others and get things done. [...] Brinkman won the March 2 primary: [...] 7,113 (63.00%) to 4,178 (37.00%).|$|E

2500|$|The prison {{abolition}} movement {{seeks to}} reduce or eliminate prisons and the prison system, {{and replace them with}} more humane and effective systems. It is distinct from prison reform, which is the attempt to improve conditions inside prisons; however, relying on prisons less can significantly improve their conditions by eliminating overcrowding. Abolitionists criticize the focus on [...] "crime" [...] as violations of laws that are arbitrarily defined by those in power—especially when these <b>lawmakers</b> <b>are</b> seen as oppressive and corrupt. Abolitionists see most anti-social acts (violence, theft, etc.) as the result of social problems (e.g. poverty, racism, sexism) that cannot be dealt with by simply punishing individuals, and instead require systemic changes to address the underlying structural causes.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the state}} level, California {{was the first}} state to offer paid family leave {{benefits}} for its workers. While the benefits only last for 6 weeks [...] this is the first major step for maternity leave in the United States. New Jersey <b>lawmakers</b> <b>are</b> pushing legislation that would make their state the second state to add this worker benefit. Under one New Jersey proposal, workers who take leave would be paid through the state’s temporary disability insurance fund, [...] "augmented by a 0.1 percent charge on workers’ weekly wages." [...] Traditionally, many conservatives have opposed paid family leave, but there is a sign that this mindset is beginning to change. Reverend Paul Schenck, a prominent member of the National Pro-Life Action Center recently stated that he would support paid maternity leave on the assumption that it might encourage women to follow through with their pregnancies instead of having abortions. According to Heyman, [...] "Across the political spectrum, people are realizing these policies have an enormous impact on working families. If you look at the most competitive economies in the world, all the others except the U.S. have these policies in place." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{have called}} for laws {{to be made to}} bar lawmakers from resigning without sound reasons in future: Barrister Alan Hoo urged the {{government}} to amend the law as soon as possible to prohibit legislators resigning unless they are [...] "incapacitated." [...] Priscilla Leung said she planned to introduce a private member's bill into the Legislative Council soon, to limit the ability of members to resign, which Ronny Tong said would contravene the Basic Law, and infringe upon the right to stand for elections protected under Article 26; he stated that it would be inconsistent with Article 74 for an individual legislator to table bills relating to the political structure. On 10 February, the constitutional affairs panel of LegCo passed a non-binding motion calling on the government to amend election bylaws, barring anyone who has resigned from standing for re-election. Basic Law Committee member Lau Nai-keung said that the government-friendly camp should not contest the by-elections to lend credibility to the campaign. He urged Legco president not to accept the resignations by the five lawmakers, not hold any by-elections to fill the vacancies, and [...] "declare those <b>lawmakers</b> <b>are</b> no longer qualified for office if they are absent from meetings for three consecutive months without valid reasons." ...|$|E
