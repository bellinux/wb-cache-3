40|$|Recently a <b>long</b> <b>ranged</b> superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) {{proximity}} effect {{has been reported}} in Co crystalline nanowires [1, Nature, 6 389 (2010) ]. Since the authors of [1] take care to avoid the existence of magnetic domains, the triplet character of the <b>long</b> <b>ranged</b> {{proximity effect}} is improbable. Here we demonstrate that in the one-dimensional ballistic regime the standard singlet S/F proximity effect becomes <b>long</b> <b>ranged.</b> We provide an exact solution for the decay of the superconducting correlations near critical temperature ($T_{c}$) and for arbitrary impurities concentration. In particular we find a specific regime, between the diffusive and ballistic ones, where the decay length is simply the electronic mean-free path. Finally possible experiments which could permit to elucidate the nature of the observed <b>long</b> <b>ranged</b> proximity effect in Co nanowires are discussed. Comment: 4 page...|$|R

5|$|No.1 <b>Long</b> <b>Range</b> Flight {{undertook}} {{intensive training}} in the lead-up to the race. This involved making regular <b>long</b> <b>range</b> return flights between Laverton and Ceylon, Singapore and Christchurch via various air bases in Australia. These exercises were used to establish fuel consumption rates and practice the refuelling and navigation practices {{that would be used}} in the race. As part of this training the flight broke many Australian and New Zealand air speed records, setting the fastest time for crossing the Tasman Sea during a flight between RAAF Base Amberley and Christchurch on 16August. An aeronautical engineer was attached to No.1 <b>Long</b> <b>Range</b> Flight from the Department of Air to calculate the optimum route for the Canberras to take. On 2September Cuming and Raw visited the Government Aircraft Factories facility at Fishermans Bend in Melbourne to thank the workers who were building Canberra bombers for the RAAF.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{called the}} <b>Long</b> <b>Range</b> Patrol (LRP), the unit {{was founded in}} Egypt in June 1940 by Major Ralph A. Bagnold, acting under the {{direction}} of General Archibald Wavell. Bagnold was assisted by Captain Patrick Clayton and Captain William Shaw. At first the majority of the men were from New Zealand, but they were soon joined by Southern Rhodesian and British volunteers, whereupon new sub-units were formed and the name was changed to the better-known <b>Long</b> <b>Range</b> Desert Group (LRDG). The LRDG never numbered more than 350 men, all of whom were volunteers.|$|E

USS Zumwalt is currently assigned to the US Pacific Fleet and is homeported in San Diego, California.|$|E
5|$|Both {{factions in}} Day of Defeat: Source {{have access to}} six classes. Each class is {{designed}} with specific combat circumstances in mind, so that teams must use teamwork to succeed. The weapons and equipment carried by the classes {{are based on the}} weapons used by both the US Army and Wehrmacht during World War II. Some of classes are armed with pistols—the American M1911 or the German Walther P38—while others are equipped with trench knives or entrenching tools for melee combat. Grenades are carried by a number of classes, depending on their role in the game—riflemen are equipped with rifle grenades, the assault classes are armed with a single fragmentation grenade and a smoke grenade for providing concealment, while support classes have access to two standard fragmentation grenades. Riflemen are armed with the M1 Garand or the Karabiner 98 kurz and are designed for medium to <b>long</b> <b>range</b> combat, while the assault classes carries the M1 Thompson or the MP40 which are only effective in close quarters. The support classes are designed for medium range combat, equipped with either the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle or the StG44. Snipers are used for attacking enemy targets from <b>long</b> <b>range,</b> and are consequently armed with the Springfield M1903 or the Karabiner 98k both equipped with <b>long</b> <b>range</b> scopes. Machine gunners carries the M1919 Browning or the MG42 to defend key locations on a level or to provide a base of fire for their team's advance. Machine gunners are required to deploy their weapons on bipods before firing in order to compensate for the machine gun's extreme recoil. The final class is armed with a Bazooka or a Panzerschreck, used in the game to displace enemy machine gun or sniper positions. This class is armed with either an M1 carbine or Mauser M712 to defend themselves with when moving.|$|E
