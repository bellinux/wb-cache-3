40|$|A {{basis is}} {{provided}} for the feasibility of air-borne <b>laser</b> <b>fluorosensing</b> not only of chlorophyll but also of pollutants such as oils and chemicals. There was a satisfactory correlation between the laser data and those obtained manually. The absolute determination of the chlorophyll concentration is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of <b>laser</b> <b>fluorosensing</b> to the tracing of metals in acid lakes is proposed. The {{effects of the}} metals on the dissolving organic carbon (DOC) fluorescence is studied using laboratory mixed water samples and natural water samples from Hamilton and Big Moose Lakes in New York. The operation of the <b>laser</b> <b>fluorosensing</b> system employed in the experiment is described. The DOC fluorescence was quenched by Al, Cu, and Fe, and the relation between pH and the quenching rate is examined. The humic substances fluorescence spectra are analyzed to estimate the concentrations of DOC in water and the relative concentration of Al. The interference problems caused by chemical competition between metal ions and ligands, {{and changes in the}} background DOC fluorescence are discussed. It is noted that an airborne laser fluorescence is useful for detecting elevated concentrations of metals...|$|E
40|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>fluorosensing</b> {{techniques}} {{used for the}} airborne measurement of chlorophyll a and other naturally occurring waterborne pigments are reviewed. Previous experiments demonstrating {{the utility of the}} airborne oceanographic lidar (AOL) for assessment of various marine parameters are briefly discussed. The configuration of the AOL during the NOAA/NASA Superflux experiments is described. The participation of the AOL in these experiments is presented and the preliminary results are discussed. The importance of multispectral receiving capability in a <b>laser</b> <b>fluorosensing</b> system for providing reproducible measurements over wide areas having spatial variations in water column transmittance properties is addressed. This capability minimizes the number of truthing points required and is usable even in shallow estuarine areas where resuspension of bottom sediment is common. Finally, problems encountered on the Superflux missions and the resulting limitations on the AOL data sets are addressed and feasible solutions to these problems are provided...|$|E
40|$|Instrument {{concepts}} which measure ocean temperature, chlorophyll, sediment and Gelbstoffe {{concentrations in}} three dimensions on a quantitative, quasi-synoptic basis were considered. Coastal zone color scanner chlorophyll imagery, laser stimulated Raman temperaure and fluorescence spectroscopy, existing airborne Lidar and <b>laser</b> <b>fluorosensing</b> instruments, and their accuracies in quantifying concentrations of chlorophyll, suspended sediments and Gelbstoffe are presented. Lidar applications to phytoplankton dynamics and photochemistry, Lidar radiative transfer and signal interpretation, and Lidar technology are discussed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>fluorosensing</b> {{can be used}} {{to monitor}} {{dissolved}} organic carbon (DOC), but analysis of the data can be hindered by several environmental phenomena. These phenomena include attenuation of the laser beam and differential attenuation of the fluorescence by the water column, variability in the molecular weight composition of the DOC, and temperature, pH, and metal ion effects on DOC fluorescence. These factors are discussed in terms of their effect on laboratory and remote field data analysis. Experimental results are provided. Analysis of fluorosensor data of DOC may be improved by compensating for the environmental factors. An improved methodology is discussed, and a suggestion is made for indirect monitoring of pH and metal ion concentration...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of time resolved observations {{can provide a}} very penetrating tool {{in the practice of}} <b>laser</b> <b>fluorosensing.</b> The investigations have demonstrated a relevance of multispectral, time resolved analysis for oil fingerprinting. By comparative studies on a variety of crude oils and their most significant fractions, {{it was found that the}} process of time decay in a composite oil is characterized by a few steps, which are associated with specific components in the medium light range. The average decay times of these pure fractions are markedly differentiated as to absolute values and spectral spread; as a consequence, the corresponding parameters in the resultant crude are quite sensitive to the particular mixture of these components. Measurements of the time response give then a finer discrimination between oil classes, depending on the relative content of certain fractions. Experiments were pursued with an improved fluorosensor facility, in order to test the application of time resolved fluorosensing to remote samples on water...|$|E
40|$|Airborne lidar {{measurements}} were performed over a deployed monomolecular oleyl alcohol surface film ('slick'), the physicochemical characteristics {{of which are}} known to be similar to biogenic organic compounds secreted by plankton and fish, and adjacent 'clean' sea surfaces in the North Sea. In the presence of the slick, the suppression of the Raman backscatter at 381 nm and of two spectral bands indicative of water column fluorescent organic material at 414 and 482 nm were observed. This effect is explained by two possible mechanisms giving rise to a modification of the transmission or coupling of the laser beam into the water column: (1) the damping of capillary and short gravity water waves by the oleyl alcohol slick, and (2) the modification of the uppermost water layer by the oleyl alcohol film. The results obtained {{in the presence of a}} slick are compared with data measured over a Murban crude-oil spill with the same lidar system off the coast of the U. S. A. The consequences of the lidar-monomolecular film experiments with regard to the remote detection of crude-oil spills and oil-thickness measurements with an airborne <b>laser</b> <b>fluorosensing</b> system will be discussed...|$|E
