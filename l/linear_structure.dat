5|$|Final Fantasy XIII-2, {{a direct}} sequel to XIII, was {{released}} in December 2011 in Japan, and in January and February, 2012 in North America and Europe respectively. In response to criticism the company received from critics and fans about XIIIs <b>linear</b> <b>structure,</b> XIII-2 {{was designed to be}} a more traditional role-playing game, with explorable towns, a nonlinear story structure, mini-games and other traditional features.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s the {{prevailing}} {{view was that}} the genes in a chromosome acted like discrete entities, indivisible by recombination and arranged like beads on a string. The experiments of Benzer using mutants defective in the rII region of bacteriophage T4 (1955-1959) showed that individual genes have a simple <b>linear</b> <b>structure</b> {{and are likely to}} be equivalent to a linear section of DNA.|$|E
5|$|The {{design for}} Fremantle Prison {{was based on}} the Pentonville Prison in Britain, but with {{diagonal}} cell blocks replaced with a four-storey <b>linear</b> <b>structure,</b> which would be the longest, tallest prison cell block in the southern hemisphere. Construction began in 1851, and work rapidly progressed following the arrival of the Royal Engineers later that year. They trained convicts to work with limestone, which was quarried on-site. The first priority was the construction of accommodation for Henderson and the prison warders, to relieve the expense of paying for private lodging.|$|E

Our approach {{is based on}} automatically establishing correspondence between <b>linear</b> <b>structures</b> which appear in images using robust features such as orientation, width and curvature extracted from those structures. The re-sulting correspondence is used to track <b>linear</b> <b>structures</b> and regions in mam-mographic images taken at different times. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of <b>linear</b> <b>structures</b> on major geological formations plays {{a crucial role}} in resource exploration in the Inner Niger Delta. Highlighting and mapping of the large lithological units were carried out using image fusion, spectral bands (RGB coding), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and band ratio methods. The automatic extraction method of <b>linear</b> <b>structures</b> has permitted the obtaining of a structural map with 82, 659 <b>linear</b> <b>structures,</b> distributed on different stratigraphic stages. The intensity study shows an accentuation in density over 12. 52 % of the total area, containing 22. 02 % of the <b>linear</b> <b>structures.</b> The density and nodes (intersections of fractures) formed by the <b>linear</b> <b>structures</b> on the different lithologies allowed to observe the behavior of the region’s aquifers in the exploration of subsoil resources. The central density, in relation to the hydrographic network of the lowlands, shows the conditioning of the flow and retention of groundwater in the region, and in-depth fluids. The node areas and high-density <b>linear</b> <b>structures,</b> have shown an ability to have rejections in deep (pores) that favor the formation of structural traps for oil resources...|$|R

5|$|Final Fantasy XIII was {{positively}} received in Japanese magazines, garnering exceptionally high scores from both Famitsu and Dengeki PlayStation. In the west, {{the game was}} praised for its graphics, battle system, and music, but opinions were mixed about its story and it was criticized for its highly <b>linear</b> <b>structure.</b> XIII also won an award for best graphics in GamesRadars 2012 Platinum Trophy Awards. XIII-2 received a positive reception overall, gaining perfect scores from Famitsu and Dengeki PlayStation, and high scores from most western sites. Common points of praise were its non-linear nature, improved battle system and graphics, while the main points of criticism were its story and characters, which were often called weak, confusing or both. Lightning Returns received mixed to positive reviews, with its combat being highly praised, its graphics and time limit mechanic drawing mixed responses, and the story and characters being cited as poorly developed.|$|E
25|$|Hitman: Absolution was {{met with}} a {{polarized}} reception. Most positive comments were concerning the game's graphics, environments and locations, and the varied gameplay options. However, many critics disliked the game for its <b>linear</b> <b>structure</b> {{as opposed to the}} open ended nature of previous installments. As of March 2013, the game has sold over 3.6 million copies.|$|E
25|$|One {{may also}} define collineation groups for axiomatically defined {{projective}} spaces, {{where there is}} no natural notion of a projective linear transform. However, {{with the exception of the}} non-Desarguesian planes, all projective spaces are the projectivization of a linear space over a division ring though, as noted above, there are multiple choices of <b>linear</b> <b>structure,</b> namely a torsor over Gal(K/k) (for n ≥ 3).|$|E
40|$|Skew angle in a {{document}} image is estimated using operators known from mathematical morphology. Skew angle in {{a document}} image is estimated by run-length smoothing {{the image and}} then producing a plurality of eroded run-length-smoothed images. The run-length-smoothed image is eroded using a <b>linear</b> <b>structuring</b> element oriented at each of a plurality of different angles. The angle of the <b>linear</b> <b>structuring</b> element which produces an eroded image having the greatest surface area is designated as the skew angle. A plurality of run-length-smoothed images may be produced, each generated by smoothing the document image using a <b>linear</b> <b>structuring</b> element oriented at a respective different angle. Then each run-length smoothed image is eroded using a <b>linear</b> <b>structuring</b> element oriented at the corresponding angle...|$|R
40|$|Computer-based {{analysis}} of digitised x-ray mammograms enables the automatic detection of subtle signs of cancer. These include stellate lesions and architectural distortions, {{both of which}} are characterised by patterns of <b>linear</b> <b>structures.</b> The automated detection of such lesions in digitised mammograms is a challenging task due mainly to the similarity between the lesions and other naturally occurring patterns of <b>linear</b> <b>structures</b> within the breast. breast. Consequently current algorithms produce a large proportion of false positive detections. This paper focuses on the detection and classification of anatomically different types of <b>linear</b> <b>structures</b> to enable accurate detection of abnormal line patterns. We demonstrate the automatic detection of lines via a non-linear multi-scale directional ridge operator and present a method of modelling the cross-sectional intensity profiles of the <b>linear</b> <b>structures.</b> The model, which is based on principle component analysis (PCA), was trained on [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Certain {{kinds of}} {{abnormalities}} in x-ray mammograms {{are associated with}} specific anatomical structures- in particular, <b>linear</b> <b>structures.</b> This association can be exploited to improve the specificity and sensitivity with which the abnormalities can be detected. Here we describe how the detection and classification of <b>linear</b> <b>structures</b> can improve the detectability (¡£ ¢ from 0. 74 to 0. 93) of micro-calcifications and {{be used as an}} indication of malignancy (with ¡£ ¢ equal to 0. 69). The detection stage uses a non-linear operator and the classification is based on cross-sectional profiles of the detected <b>linear</b> <b>structures.</b> ...|$|R
25|$|In 1946, Joshua Lederberg and Edward Tatum first {{described}} the {{phenomenon known as}} bacterial conjugation using E. coli as a model bacterium, and it remains a primary model to study conjugation. E. coli {{was an integral part}} of the first experiments to understand phage genetics, and early researchers, such as Seymour Benzer, used E. coli and phage T4 to understand the topography of gene structure. Prior to Benzer's research, it was not known whether the gene was a <b>linear</b> <b>structure,</b> or if it had a branching pattern.|$|E
25|$|Lehovec tested {{his idea}} using the {{technologies}} of making transistors {{that were available}} at Sprague. His device was a <b>linear</b> <b>structure</b> 2.2×0.5×0.1mm in size, which was divided into isolated n-type cells (bases of the future transistors) by p-n junctions. Layers and transitions were formed by growth from the melt. The conductivity type {{was determined by the}} pulling speed of the crystal: an indium-rich p-type layer was formed at a slow speed, whereas an arsenic-rich n-type layer was produced at a high speed. The collectors and emitters of the transistors were created by welding indium beads. All electrical connections were made by hand, using gold wires.|$|E
25|$|If the two {{terminal}} repeats in a solenoid do {{not physically}} interact, {{it leads to}} an open or <b>linear</b> <b>structure.</b> Members of this group are frequently rod- or crescent-shaped. The number of individual repeats can range from 2 to over 50. A clear advantage of this topology is that both the N- and C-terminal ends are free to add new repeats and folds, or even remove existing ones during evolution without any gross impact on the structural stability of the entire domain. This type of domain is extremely common among extracellular segments of receptors or cell adhesion molecules. A non-exhaustive list of examples include: EGF repeats, cadherin repeats, leucine-rich repeats, HEAT repeats, ankyrin repeats, armadillo repeats, tetratricopeptide repeats, etc. Whenever a linear solenoid domain structure participates in protein-protein interactions, frequently at least 3 or more repetitive subunits form the ligand-binding sites. Thus - while individual repeats might have a (limited) ability to fold on their own – they usually cannot perform {{the functions of the}} entire domain alone.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{paper is}} dealing with two {{important}} subclasses of plateaued functions: bent and semi-bent functions. In {{the first part of}} the paper, we construct mainly bent and semi-bent functions in the Maiorana-McFarland class using Boolean functions having <b>linear</b> <b>structures</b> (<b>linear</b> translators) systematically. Although most of these results are rather direct appli-cations of some recent results, using <b>linear</b> <b>structures</b> (<b>linear</b> translators) allows us to have certain flexibilities to control extra properties of these plateaued functions. In the second part of the paper, using the results of the first part and exploiting these flexibilities, we modify many secondary constructions. Therefore, we obtain new secondary constructions of bent and semi-bent functions not belonging to the Maiorana-McFarland class. Instead of using bent (semi-bent) functions as ingredients, our secondary constructions use only Boolean (vectorial Boolean) functions with <b>linear</b> <b>structures</b> (<b>linear</b> translators) which are very easy to choose. Moreover, all of them are very explicit and we also determine the duals of the bent functions in our constructions. We show how these <b>linear</b> <b>structures</b> should be chosen in order to satisfy the corresponding conditions coming from using derivatives and quadratic/cubic functions in our secondary constructions...|$|R

500|$|While the {{transmission}} of series two was being delayed by BBC2 controller Michael Jackson, the show won the Bronze Rose of Montreux and was entered for the Emmys. The show was remade in Portugal but used a <b>linear</b> <b>structure</b> rather than the flashbacks. Moffat reflects that although the remake is [...] "not as dark or ground-breaking" [...] as the original, it is [...] "probably more fun" [...] because it ends happily.|$|E
500|$|Redemption is {{presented}} in the first- and third-person perspectives. The player controls Christof and up to three allies through a <b>linear</b> <b>structure,</b> providing the player with missions to progress through a set narrative. Certain actions committed by Christof throughout the game can raise or lower his humanity, affecting which of the game's three endings the player receives. As a Vampire, Christof is imbued with a variety of abilities and powers {{that can be used to}} combat or avoid enemies and obstacles. Use of these abilities drains Christof's supply of blood which can be replenished by drinking from enemies or innocents. It includes multiplayer gameplay called [...] "Storyteller", which allows one player to create a narrative for a group of players with the ability to modify the game dynamically in reaction to the players' actions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Mammographic risk {{assessment}} {{is concerned with}} estimating {{the probability of a}} woman developing breast cancer. The aim is to improve the likelihood of early detection of breast cancers. The leading factor in determining risk is breast density, which {{has been shown to be}} the most accurate measure of mammographic risk, however more recently it has been suggested that the density (and possibly the distribution) of <b>linear</b> <b>structures</b> such as ducts and blood vessels within the breast are also related to mammographic risk. The purpose of this project is to investigate those relationships and the possibility of including this information in an automated {{risk assessment}} system. A methodology is developed for detecting the <b>linear</b> <b>structures</b> in 2 D mammograms. This information is used to calculate the density of <b>linear</b> <b>structures</b> which is used in a risk classifier.

500|$|Henderson's initial {{design for}} Fremantle Prison {{was based on}} the Pentonville Prison in Britain. Pentonville, {{designed}} by Joshua Jebb, used the [...] "separate system" [...] that kept prisoners in nearly complete isolation, to encourage reflection on their crimes. Jebb reviewed Henderson's plans in 1851, and to reduce the cost, he changed the two diagonal cell blocks that mimicked Pentonville into a four-storey <b>linear</b> <b>structure,</b> which would be the longest, tallest prison cell block in the southern hemisphere. Construction began soon afterwards, supervised by Henderson, Manning, and Royal Engineer lieutenant Henry Wray, who had arrived with another convict ship. Within eighteen months of the Scindians arrival, the convict population had grown to almost 1000. In 1855 convicts began to be moved into The Establishment, as the prison was then known as, but the project would not be completed until 1859.|$|E
500|$|In {{the fantasy}} {{sequences}} for the pilot, Bathurst was filmed against a completely black backdrop, which Moffat describes as [...] "hell to look at". For the series, the sequences were filmed {{in a real}} club. Moffat describes this as the [...] "wrong direction" [...] as it became unclear that the fantasy sequences were [...] "not real". Moffat observes that, like Seinfeld, an American sitcom that used a similar device, Joking Apart would use less of the stand-up as the series progressed. In retrospect, Moffat regrets including the stand-up sequences. Bathurst, however, has considered refilming them as a video diary. Now with older features, he can portray a Mark Taylor reflecting on his earlier life. Both are very critical of the sequences in the DVD audio commentaries. The sequences have also drawn the sharpest criticisms from reviewers. The second series followed a more <b>linear</b> <b>structure,</b> although it retained the stand-up sequences.|$|E
500|$|Nintendo Power was {{positive}} overall, {{saying that it}} [...] "was well worth the wait." [...] Jeff Cork of Game Informer was more critical than other reviewers, saying that most {{other aspects of the}} game were let down badly by the control scheme. Edge Magazine {{was positive}} overall, saying that fans of the original Kid Icarus would enjoy the game, praising the way it effectively combined elements from multiple genres. Steve Hogarty of Official Nintendo Magazine recommended Uprising for hardcore gamers rather than casual gamers, saying it felt deeper than equivalent home console games. Opinions were generally positive on the lighthearted story, in-game dialogue, graphics, several aspects of gameplay, and its multiplayer options. However, a unanimous criticism was the control scheme, which was variously described as difficult or potentially damaging to players' hands, while also creating issues with moving Pit. There were also negative comments about the game's <b>linear</b> <b>structure.</b>|$|E

500|$|Based on {{feedback}} from the game's first commercial demo, adjustable difficulty settings were added {{in the form of}} players changing [...] "battle modes" [...] to alter the speed and complexity of battles. A major element added to the game was Prompto's ability to take photographs. As the character had garnered negative {{feedback from}} players, Tabata wanted to make the character more useful and appealing to players, and so it was incorporated into the game so players could chronicle their journey. The inclusion of an airship function into the party's vehicle came from Tabata's wish to keep the party in the Regalia while simulating the experience of landing an aircraft. The team experimented with enabling compatibility with virtual reality headsets, but this proved impractical as players would likely be wearing them {{for hours at a time}} due to the game's size. The game's shift during the second half of the story from an open world to a <b>linear</b> <b>structure</b> was based on story requirements and budgetary restrictions, as making the entire experience open world would have doubled development time and costs. Many elements added to the game in later updates, such as controlling all the main characters, had to be discarded from the main game due to technological and budget-based restrictions.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was generally}} well received. Famitsu praised the battle system, {{saying that it}} was friendly towards casual gamers. MacDonald likewise praised the battle system as [...] "one of the best combat systems I've played with in any RPG, Japanese or otherwise". Walton found the battle system fun and enjoyed the amount of side quests, while Dagostino was highly positive about the game's successful efforts in moving away from genre tradition. Juba enjoyed the multiplayer and praised the game for moving away from the genre's traditional battle systems despite faults with their overall implementation, while Robinson found the gameplay suffered from the design goals that had fueled its creation. Castle was positive about the variety of gameplay and tactical elements despite some stiff combat mechanics, but noted the inability to alter difficulty being a point against the game. Wishnov praised the fast pace and variety of the combat, but found that more cumbersome RPG elements and a lack of overall control negatively impacted the experience. GameTrailers generally praised about the way gameplay and combat was handled despite some [...] "clunky" [...] moments, but was less positive the multiplayer option's balance and variety. Edge, while noting multiple core similarities with other games within the genre, found that other elements came together to make it a more fast-paced cinematic experience than other traditional RPGs; Fuller enjoyed the battle system, but thought that it lacked challenge and had difficulties with the camera. Parkin was generally positive about combat, particularly about the blending and gradual growth of character abilities, while Nintendo Power called the battle system [...] "satisfying" [...] and the multiplayer [...] "surprisingly worthwhile".
