In 1952, the school buildings were considered insufficient so a new block was built, opening in 1955. By 1960 the numbers of boys admitted had increased significantly, particularly among day pupils; 230 non-boarding students attended that year, alongside 64 boarders.|$|E
5|$|Membership {{peaked in}} the 1920s, {{but with the}} onset of the Great Depression {{declined}} steadily, and by the 1970s the congregation could no <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> to heat the sanctuary. Membership has recovered since that low point; the congregation renovated its school/community center in 2004, and in 2008 embarked on a million-dollar capital campaign to renovate the sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|The {{membership}} decline {{continued in}} the late 1960s and early 1970s, as older congregants died and moved away, and dwindled {{to the point where}} the congregation could no <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> to heat the sanctuary, and thought they would have to disband. Nevertheless, in 1972 the congregation established a nursery school and prozdor (high school).|$|E

Hardly a day passed but I was {{subjected}} to their annoying requests, until at last my existence became a burden to me; the pleasures I had previously enjoyed no <b>longer</b> <b>afforded</b> me delight, and all my former desire {{to escape from the}} valley now revived with additional force.|$|R
5|$|Marguerite Louise's extravagances perturbed Ferdinando {{because the}} Tuscan {{exchequer}} was nearly bankrupt; {{it was so}} empty that when the Wars of Castro mercenaries were paid for, the state could no <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> to pay interest on government bonds. Accordingly, the interest rate was lowered by 0.75%. The economy, too, was so decrepit that barter trade became prevalent in rural market places. In August 1663 Marguerite Louise delivered a boy: Ferdinando. Two more children followed: Anna Maria Luisa in 1667 and Gian Gastone in 1671.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Council met at 10:30. Suzuki, who {{had just}} come from {{a meeting with the}} Emperor, said it was {{impossible}} to continue the war. Tōgō Shigenori said that they could accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, but they needed a guarantee of the Emperor's position. Navy Minister Yonai said that they had to make some diplomatic proposal—they could no <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> to wait for better circumstances.|$|E
5|$|By 1931, {{more than}} 80percent of the {{services}} offered by industrial laundries were sold to individual families. However, as the Great Depression continued, many people could no <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> the services, and business declined. The decline continued after World War II when electric washers and dryers meant for home use became affordable to {{a large percentage of}} the populace. As individual customers disappeared, factory laundries turned to specialized services such as washing diapers or linens. In 1950, the American Linen Supply Company bought the Yale Laundry Company. In 1959, Perfect Fit Manufacturing began to use the building to make auto seat covers, tire covers, and other automotive fabrics. Perfect Fit remained in the building through 2006.|$|E

Sitting {{transversely}} across the Usk valley between {{the river and the}} village of Bwlch, it provides excellent panoramic views down the valley and across to the Black Mountains. The summit at 316m above sea level is marked by an OS trig point though this is now within a dense conifer plantation and so no <b>longer</b> <b>affords</b> any outward views.

5|$|Instead, Metternich stayed six months, entrusting {{his office}} in Vienna to his father. He set about using the marriage, and flattery, to renegotiate the terms set out at Schönbrunn. The {{concessions}} he won were trivial, however: a few trading rights, delay in the payment of the war indemnity, restitution of some estates belonging to Germans in the Austrian service, including the Metternich family's, and the lifting of a 150,000 man limit on the Austrian army. The last was particularly welcomed {{as a sign of}} increased Austrian independence, although Austria could no <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> an army greater than the limit prescribed.|$|E
5|$|Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury is an oil {{on canvas}} {{painting}} by Albert Chevallier Tayler completed in 1907. It was commissioned by the Kent County Cricket Club {{at the suggestion of}} chairman Lord Harris to celebrate their first County Championship title win. Tayler painted the picture after taking individual sittings with each of the Kent players. With the exception of short-term loans, the painting remained at the St Lawrence Ground until 1999, at which time it was moved to the Lord's Pavilion as the Kent Club could no <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> the insurance. In 2006, Kent sold the painting to a charity foundation at an auction. The piece is currently on display at Lord's Cricket Ground in London.|$|E
5|$|Merrick was now {{homeless}} on {{the streets}} of Leicester. His uncle, a barber named Charles Merrick, heard of his nephew's situation, sought him out and offered him accommodation in his home. Merrick continued to hawk around Leicester {{for the next two years}} but his efforts to earn a living met with little more success than before. Eventually, his disfigurement drew such negative attention from members of the public that the Commissioners for Hackney Carriages withdrew his licence when it came up for renewal. With young children to provide for, Charles could no <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> to support his nephew. In late December 1879, now 17 years old, Merrick entered the Leicester Union Workhouse.|$|E

60|$|Tannis {{came home}} from the academy at Prince Albert early in July, when Carey had been at the Flats a month and had {{exhausted}} all the few novelties of his position. Paul Dumont had already become so expert at the code that his mistakes no <b>longer</b> <b>afforded</b> Carey any fun, and the latter was getting desperate. He had serious intentions of throwing up the business altogether, and betaking himself to an Alberta ranch, where at least one would have the excitement of roping horses. When he saw Tannis Dumont he thought he would hang on awhile longer, anyway.|$|R
5|$|The {{collection}} {{was at first}} housed in Sigurður's office at the college until he retired from his teaching job. He decided, more as a hobby than a job, {{to put it on}} public display in Reykjavík and was awarded a grant from the city council of ISK 200,000 to support the opening of a museum in August 1997. By 2003, it was attracting 5,200 visitors a year, of which 4,200 were from abroad. He put the museum up for sale in 2003, but also offered it to the city of Reykjavík as a gift. However, he was unsuccessful in obtaining financial support from the state or city. When he retired in 2004, he could no <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> the rent on the museum's premises.|$|E
5|$|The {{family moved}} to the United States and settled in Key West, Florida, in 1820. Young Stephen was sent to school near Mobile, Alabama, but his {{education}} was interrupted by his father's death. His elder brother John also died about this time. To support herself and her surviving son, Ellen opened a boarding house for seamen. Then she sent her son away for further schooling at a Moravian academy in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. Although he was {{for all of his}} life a practicing Catholic, he had only praise for the education he received at the academy. After about three years, his mother could no <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> to pay his tuition, so in 1829 his schooling ended and he returned home.|$|E
5|$|The {{heaviest}} fighting {{occurred at}} the Thomas gate, where Thomas again commanded the sally in person. After intense fighting, Thomas, seeing {{that there was no}} weakening in the Muslim front, decided that continuing the attack would be fruitless and would lead to even heavier casualties among his men. He ordered a withdrawal and the Romans moved back at a steady pace, during which they were subjected to a concentrated shower of arrows by the Muslims. This was the last attempt by Thomas to break the siege. The attempt had failed. He had lost thousands of men in these sallies, and could no <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> to fight outside the walls of the city.|$|E
60|$|At last, {{there was}} nothing more that the besiegers could do. The town was reduced to ashes, but the river and the broken arch still {{separated}} them from the ruins. To remain much longer where they were was impossible, for the country on every side was exhausted, and no <b>longer</b> <b>afforded</b> food for man or horse. The country people had fled, from the cruelty and spoliation of Ginckle's foreign soldiery, carrying with them all their effects; and the Irish light troops and armed peasantry hovered round the camp, laid the country waste, and intercepted their supplies and communications with Dublin.|$|R

This album in many ways was a collaborative effort with Bobby Miller, who produced the album. Miller also {{had a hand in}} composing eight of its tracks. Although the album made it into the US R&B Top Five, it underperformed on the US pop charts, peaking at number 168. Those slipping figures were indicators of the increasing lack of interest from Motown in Ruffin's career.|$|R
5|$|While Murray {{prepared}} Emma for publication, Austen began The Elliots, later {{published as}} Persuasion. She completed her first draft in July 1816. In addition, {{shortly after the}} publication of Emma, Henry Austen repurchased the copyright for Susan from Crosby. Austen was forced to postpone publishing either of these completed novels by family financial troubles. Henry Austen's bank failed in March 1816, depriving him of all of his assets, leaving him deeply in debt and losing Edward, James, and Frank Austen large sums. Henry and Frank could no <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> the contributions they had made to support their mother and sisters.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} rising {{importance}} of a central administration arose {{a new class of}} educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services. Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the pharaoh after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic power of the pharaoh, and that the economy could no <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> to support a large centralized administration. As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the pharaoh. This, coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150BC, is assumed to have caused the country to enter the 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the year, {{the boys}} must pass seven final exams to graduate. Anmar, Hyder and Ali each fail two subjects, and are given the option to retake the exams.

Hyder also retakes his exams and passes, but his family can no <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> to pay for the university fees. Ali chooses not to retake the exams, and his family leave Iraq. Mohammad fails four subjects and must repeat his senior year. He chooses to do so at a different school while working at his uncle's scooter repair shop.

No <b>longer</b> <b>afforded</b> {{the power to make}} “back room ” deals at party conventions or relegated to the sidelines to watch as party activists nominate extremist candidates, party elites nev-ertheless maintain an important role in nominating presi-dential candidates. Instead of merely responding to the campaign, party elites appear to be the important factor that determines nomination outcomes (Cohen et al. 2008). Given the macro-level findings that party elites have the power to influence the process by making early endorse-ments (Cohen et al. 2008; Steger 2007), we should expect them all to do so. 1 Yet the data are not consistent with this point; some members of the extended party attempt to lead the process while others do not. 2 This presents...|$|R
60|$|All {{night long}} the King spent in advising how {{he should get}} rid of this obdurate young creature. Cutting off her head was much too easy a death for her; hanging was so common in His Majesty's dominions that it no <b>longer</b> <b>afforded</b> him any sport; finally, he bethought himself of a pair of fierce lions which had lately been sent to him as presents, and he determined, with these ferocious brutes, to hunt poor Rosalba down. Adjoining his castle was an amphitheatre where the Prince indulged in bull-baiting, rat-hunting, and other ferocious sports. The two lions were kept in a cage under this place; their roaring might be heard over the whole city, the {{inhabitants}} of which, I am sorry to say, thronged in numbers to see a poor young lady gobbled up by two wild beasts.|$|R
5|$|In early 1957, Tubb persuaded Hamilton {{to switch}} the {{magazine}} from pocket-book to digest size format, {{in the hope}} that this would improve the magazine's visibility on bookstalls. The circulation did indeed rise, to about 14,000 copies per month—a surprisingly low figure given Landsborough's assertion that Authentic had been selling 30,000 copies in the early days. However, later that year, Hamilton made the decision to invest a substantial sum in the UK paperback rights of an American best-seller: it is not known for certain which book this was, but it is thought to have been Evan Hunter's The Blackboard Jungle. Hamilton could no <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> to have cash tied up in Authentic, and in the summer of 1957 Tubb was given two months to close down the magazine, printing stories that had already been paid for. The last issue was dated October 1957.|$|E
5|$|The Dunstanburgh Castle {{golf course}} was built near the {{property}} in 1900, and expanded by the castle's then owner, Sir Arthur Sutherland, in 1922. By the 1920s Sutherland could no <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> to maintain the castle, and he placed it into the guardianship {{of the state in}} 1930. When the Second World War broke out in 1939, measures were taken to defend the Northumberland coastline from a potential German invasion. The castle was used as an observation post and the site was refortified with trenches, barbed wire, pill boxes and a mine field. In the 21st century the castle is owned by the National Trust and run by English Heritage. The ruins are protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building, and are part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest, forming an important natural environment for birds and amphibians.|$|E
5|$|The Earps {{moved back}} to San Francisco in 1891 in part so Sadie could be closer to her {{half-sister}} Henrietta's family. Earp developed {{a reputation as a}} sportsman and a gambler. He held onto his San Diego properties, but when their value fell, he could not pay the taxes. He was forced to sell the lots. He continued to race horses, but by 1896, he could no <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> to own them. He raced them on behalf of the owner of a horse stable in Santa Rosa that he managed for her. From 1891 to 1897, they lived in at least four different locations in the city: 145 Ellis St., 720 McAllister St., 514A Seventh Ave. and 1004 Golden Gate Ave. In Santa Rosa, Earp personally competed in and won a harness race.|$|E

30|$|With {{respect to}} education, we observe a general linear {{relationship}} in both periods, with {{the risk of}} unemployment declining {{with higher levels of}} educational attainment. Relative to 2006, third-level qualifications are of greater importance in deterring unemployment in 2011, which is again consistent with a change in the composition of labour demand in favor of educated workers. Furthermore, by 2011, the Post Leaving Cert (PLC) level qualification, which is typically vocational in nature, no <b>longer</b> <b>afforded</b> workers any advantage relative to those with a Junior Certificate or lower levels of education. In 2006, males had approximately 1.5 times the odds of transitioning to unemployment relative to females. However, by 2011, males had over three times the odds of transitioning into unemployment compared to females. In the earlier period, Irish workers and immigrants had a similar risk of becoming unemployed, but by 2011, Irish natives had approximately half the odds of moving into unemployment relative to immigrants.|$|R

He seemed to be {{making an effort to}} reply, but had no longer sufficient volition.
