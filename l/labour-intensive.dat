5|$|In {{some areas}} of the world, {{including}} Berlin, Germany, dropping salt is prohibited altogether except on the highest-risk roads; plain sand without any melting agents is spread instead. While this may protect the environment, it is more <b>labour-intensive,</b> as more gritting runs are needed; because the sand is insoluble, it tends to accumulate at the sides of the road, making it more difficult for buses to pull in at bus stops.|$|E
5|$|Mustering is a <b>labour-intensive</b> {{process that}} results {{in one of two}} major outcomes: {{slaughter}} for sale, or relocation. It may be assisted by feed-luring in which bales of hay are strategically placed to attract feral horses to a location where capture is feasible. Complicating this process is low demand for the captured horses, making it less desirable than fertility control or shooting, which reduce the population without having to find alternative locations for them.|$|E
5|$|A leat {{from this}} stretch was created at {{around the time}} of the {{construction}} of the canal to provide water for the Twyford Mead water meadows. Farming of the water meadows continued until around 1930, after the closure of the navigation itself. It was a <b>labour-intensive</b> method of land management, but the controlled flooding of the meadows, with the deposition of silt from the water, enabled the land to produce two crops of hay per year, as well as grazing for sheep and cattle. Demonstrations of the techniques used to flood the meadows are still carried out occasionally.|$|E
5|$|Increasing labour export {{from the}} Philippines {{coincided with the}} {{economic}} rise of Hong Kong during the late 1970s and early 1980s. When the People's Republic of China implemented wide-reaching economic reform in the late 1970s and initiated trade with other countries, Hong Kong became mainland China's biggest investor. <b>Labour-intensive</b> Hong Kong industries moved to the mainland, and high-profit service industries in the territory (such as design, marketing and finance) expanded dramatically. To deal with the resulting labour shortage and increase in labour costs, the female labour force was mobilised. Two-income families sought help to manage their households, creating a demand for domestic workers. Female participation in the workforce increased, from 47.5 percent in 1982 to 54.7 percent in 2013. Families began hiring foreign domestic workers from the Philippines, {{with the number of}} workers steadily increasing during the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Advances in bioinformatics, {{refinements}} of DNA amplification, and {{the proliferation}} of computational power have greatly aided the analysis of DNA sequences recovered from environmental samples, allowing the adaptation of shotgun sequencing to metagenomic samples (known also as whole metagenome shotgun or WMGS sequencing). The approach, used to sequence many cultured microorganisms and the human genome, randomly shears DNA, sequences many short sequences, and reconstructs them into a consensus sequence. Shotgun sequencing reveals genes present in environmental samples. Historically, clone libraries were used to facilitate this sequencing. However, with advances in high throughput sequencing technologies, the cloning step is no longer necessary and greater yields of sequencing data can be obtained without this <b>labour-intensive</b> bottleneck step. Shotgun metagenomics provides information both about which organisms are present and what metabolic processes are possible in the community. Because the collection of DNA from an environment is largely uncontrolled, the most abundant organisms in an environmental sample are most highly represented in the resulting sequence data. To achieve the high coverage needed to fully resolve the genomes of under-represented community members, large samples, often prohibitively so, are needed. On the other hand, the random nature of shotgun sequencing ensures that many of these organisms, which would otherwise go unnoticed using traditional culturing techniques, will be represented by at least some small sequence segments.|$|E
5|$|After Potter's {{death in}} December 1943, Frederick Warne & Co. granted {{licenses}} to various firms {{for the production}} of merchandise based on the Potter characters. Beswick Pottery of Longton, Staffordshire released six porcelain figurines beginning in 1965 depicting characters or scenes from the tale: Flopsy, Mrs. Tittlemouse, Benjamin Bunny, Peter Rabbit Digging, a Flopsy and Benjamin Bunny tableau, and a tableau depicting the sleeping bunnies under the lettuce. and, in 1984, Schmid & Co. of Toronto and Randolph, Massachusetts released a Flopsy Bunnies music box, a flat ceramic Flopsy Christmas ornament, and in 1985 a Flopsy music box. Stuffed toy manufacturers had sought licensing rights as early as 1906 for Potter's characters, {{but it was not until}} the 1970s that an English firm was granted worldwide rights. Their <b>labour-intensive</b> products were unprofitable however, and in 1972, The Eden Toy Company of New York became the exclusive manufacturer of Potter characters. Although Peter Rabbit and Mr. McGregor were released as plush toys, they were associated with the Peter Rabbit tale and not with that of The Flopsy Bunnies. None of The Flopsy Bunnies characters were released as Eden plush toys.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century Scottish {{agriculture}} became susceptible to {{the ups and downs}} of world markets. There were dramatic price rises in the First World War, but a slump in the 1920s and 1930s, in which perhaps 40 per cent of Scottish land changed hands, followed by more price rises in the Second World War. In 1947 annual price reviews were introduced in an attempt to stabilise the market. A series of Acts of Parliament followed, designed to give price support and grants to farmers. After the Second World War and the associated rationing, there was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production. This lasted until the late 1970s, resulting in more intensive farming. More areas of marginal land were brought into production with government subsidies. At the same time, the amount of forest was increased by a factor of three. There was increasing mechanisation of Scottish agriculture. The horse was replaced by the tractor and the combine harvester. This meant that farming became less <b>labour-intensive.</b> In 1951, 88,000 people worked in Scottish agriculture full-time, but by 1991 it had fallen to about 25,000, leading to more depopulation of rural areas. This helped make Scottish agriculture among the most efficient in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{first step}} towards colourisation was the {{restoration}} of the original negatives, which were in poor condition owing to extensive printing of the negative during the original theatrical release. Costly and <b>labour-intensive</b> restoration was essential before colourisation could be carried out. The negative was cleaned of fungal growth, damaged portions were restored, and missing parts of frames were re-instated. After cleaning, each of the 300,000 frames of the negative was scanned into a 10 megabytes-sized file and then was digitally restored. The entire restoration work was undertaken by Acris Lab, Chennai. The dialogues in the original soundtrack were also in a bad state of preservation, which necessitated having the sound cleaned at Chace Studio in the United States. The background score and the entire musical track was recreated by Naushad and Uttam Singh. For the songs, the original voices of the singers like Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Mohammed Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar were extracted from the original mixed track and the same were recreated with re-recorded score in 6.1 surround sound.|$|E
5|$|The infant {{mortality}} rate in 2009 was 6 deaths per 1000 births, and life expectancy at birth in 2009 was 75 years. With the aim of developing Malaysia into a medical tourism destination, 5 per cent of the government social sector development budget is spent on health care. The population in concentrated on Peninsular Malaysia where 20million of approximately 28million Malaysians live. 70 per cent {{of the population is}} urban. Kuala Lumpur is the capital and the largest city in Malaysia, as well as its main commercial and financial centre. Putrajaya, a purpose-built city constructed from 1999, is the seat of government, as many executive and judicial branches of the federal government were moved there to ease growing congestion within Kuala Lumpur. Due to the rise in <b>labour-intensive</b> industries, the country is estimated to have over 3million migrant workers; about 10 per cent of the population. Sabah-based NGOs estimate that out of the 3million that make up the population of Sabah, 2million are illegal immigrants. Malaysia hosts a population of refugees and asylum seekers numbering approximately 171,500. Of this population, approximately 79,000 are from Burma, 72,400 from the Philippines, and 17,700 from Indonesia. Malaysian officials are reported to have turned deportees directly over to human smugglers in 2007, and Malaysia employs RELA, a volunteer militia with a history of controversies, to enforce its immigration law.|$|E
5|$|The Free State {{began using}} its new-found {{control of the}} region to levy taxes from the local population, {{gathered}} using similar hostage tactics to the Manyema. The taxes were initially collected {{in the form of}} ivory but when ivory supplies began to run low the Free State switched to natural rubber. The rubber was collected from Landolphia owariensis gentilii rubber vines which were relatively scarce in the area with an average frequency of around one plant in each acre. The rubber was gathered by tapping a rubber vine and placing a pot beneath to collect the latex which could be used in the production of rubber for the European market. If the vines were a long distance from the ground the gatherer would have had to climb a tree, tap the plant and hold the collecting pot beneath the vine, possibly for an entire day. Hence rubber collection was a <b>labour-intensive</b> process which made it unpopular with the villagers. Indeed, they preferred the Manyema to the Free State authorities as the Manyema only took low bulk, high value items such as ivory or slaves because of the long distances from their homeland whereas the state, with its steamboat transports, could afford to make the people harvest the low value high bulk rubber. By September 1892 the Free State was using its military forces to attack and occupy villages in the Lulonga and Maringa river valleys to expand its tax base.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{relocation}} of light and <b>labour-intensive</b> industries, heavy industries are still rare in Hong Kong. The large population of Hong Kong remains favourable for <b>labour-intensive</b> industries, the raw materials and products of light industries are easier to transport than the heavy industries, and there is insufficient flat land in Hong Kong for heavy industries.|$|E
25|$|Pressmen: {{the person}} who worked the press. This was {{physically}} <b>labour-intensive.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the terrain}} the {{agriculture}} is very <b>labour-intensive.</b> Dates are the main product, but also cereals, vegetables and henna are cultivated.|$|E
25|$|SAGE and CAGE methods produce {{information}} on more genes than was possible when sequencing single ESTs, but sample preparation and data analysis are typically more <b>labour-intensive.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, the <b>labour-intensive</b> {{industries}} of Hong Kong, which {{depended on the}} city's low costs to remain competitive, faced the problem of increasing land rents and labour costs. Moreover, the increase of population did not suffice as the demand for products grew. Compared to the other three Asian Tigers, Hong Kong's capital-intensive and technology-intensive industries were undeveloped and some less developed countries, such as Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, exceeded Hong Kong in the <b>labour-intensive</b> field. Another problem was the increasing protectionism of Western countries, causing some privileges to be removed and extra restrictions placed on Hong Kong products.|$|E
25|$|For example, in the Dutch coastal provinces {{agricultural}} productivity was relatively high. Hence, industrial growth arrived relatively late – after 1860 – because incentives {{to move to}} <b>labour-intensive</b> industry were quite weak.|$|E
25|$|By April 1991 3.7, million {{vehicles}} {{had been}} produced. However, {{it soon became}} apparent {{that there was no}} place for the Trabant in a reunified German economy; its inefficient, <b>labour-intensive</b> production line survived on government subsidies.|$|E
25|$|Certain <b>labour-intensive</b> {{jobs are}} less {{responsive}} to productivity innovations than others. For instance, a highly skilled Zurich burger flipper {{is no more}} productive than his Moscow counterpart (in burger/hour) but these jobs are services which must be performed locally.|$|E
25|$|Exports of a capital-abundant country {{come from}} {{capital-intensive}} industries, and labour-abundant countries import such goods, exporting <b>labour-intensive</b> goods in return. Competitive pressures within the H–O model produce this prediction fairly straightforwardly. Conveniently, {{this is an}} easily testable hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|The AFL is {{the subject}} of footy tipping and betting {{competitions}} around Australia run by individuals, syndicates, workplaces and professional bookmakers. In recent years national website based tipping competitions have started to replace the traditional, but more <b>labour-intensive,</b> office or pub run competitions.|$|E
25|$|Manufacturing in Hong Kong {{consists}} of mainly light and <b>labour-intensive</b> industries. The manufacturing industry {{started in the}} 19th century after the Taiping Rebellion and continues today, although it has largely been replaced by service industries, particularly the finance and real estate industries.|$|E
25|$|The sand likely was {{collected}} from river beds, {{where it was}} relatively clean and of more uniform particle size. The felling, transporting, drying, and storage of wood both for ash production and as fuel for the furnaces was <b>labour-intensive</b> and required {{a high level of}} organization.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} restructuring of more developed countries was another factor. After the Second World War, richer capitalist countries started {{to upgrade their}} products and technology, leaving <b>labour-intensive</b> industries to the less developed countries. This encouraged overseas investments and allowed developed technology to be imported to Hong Kong, thereby boosting Hong Kong's manufacturing industry.|$|E
25|$|Asian seiners – In Asia, {{the seine}} netter usually has the {{wheelhouse}} forward {{and the working}} deck aft, {{in the manner of}} a stern trawler. However, in regions where the fishing effort is a <b>labour-intensive,</b> low-technology approach, they are often undecked and may be powered by outboards motors, or even by sail.|$|E
25|$|Because of the <b>labour-intensive</b> work {{involved}} with animation, it was cheaper for studios to make live-action films, so animation was eschewed. But in recent years, Thailand's technology community {{has sought to}} make the country a hub for computer animation, with many animated television shows, commercials and video games being created in Thailand.|$|E
25|$|To produce dye from cochineals, {{the insects}} are {{collected}} {{when they are}} around 90 days old. Harvesting the insects is <b>labour-intensive,</b> as they must be individually knocked, brushed, or picked from the cacti and placed into bags. The insects are gathered by small groups of collectors who sell them to local processors or exporters.|$|E
25|$|Rice paddy {{agriculture}} {{has existed}} in Southeast Asia {{for thousands of}} years, ranging across the subregion. Some dramatic examples of these rice paddies populate the Banaue Rice Terraces {{in the mountains of}} Luzon in the Philippines. Maintenance of these paddies is very <b>labour-intensive.</b> The rice paddies are well-suited to the monsoon climate of the region.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of printing also changed the occupational structure of European cities. Printers {{emerged as a}} new group of artisans for whom literacy was essential, although the much more <b>labour-intensive</b> occupation of the scribe naturally declined. Proof-correcting arose as a new occupation, while a rise in the amount of booksellers and librarians naturally followed the explosion in the numbers of books.|$|E
25|$|By the 1920s, {{statistical}} methods {{were developed to}} analyze gene action and distinguish heritable variation from variation caused by environment. In 1933, another important breeding technique, cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), developed in maize, was described by Marcus Morton Rhoades. CMS is a maternally inherited trait that makes the plant produce sterile pollen. This enables the production of hybrids {{without the need for}} <b>labour-intensive</b> detasseling.|$|E
25|$|Cultivation {{and fruit}} picking by hand is <b>labour-intensive</b> and needs around one person per hectare. In parts of rural India and Africa this {{provides}} much-needed jobs - about 200,000 people worldwide now find employment through jatropha. Moreover, villagers often {{find that they}} can grow other crops {{in the shade of}} the trees. Their communities will avoid importing expensive diesel and there will be some for export too.|$|E
25|$|The Trans-National Industrial Electricity and Gas Company is {{an energy}} {{conglomerate}} based in Mogadishu. It unites five major Somali companies from the trade, finance, security and telecommunications sectors, following a 2010 joint agreement signed in Istanbul to provide {{electricity and gas}} infrastructure in Somalia. With an initial investment budget of $1 billion, the company launched the Somalia Peace Dividend Project, a <b>labour-intensive</b> energy program aimed at facilitating local industrialization initiatives.|$|E
25|$|Detector dogs provide Border Services Officers (BSOs) {{with one}} of the most {{effective}} tools in the detection of contraband. Although other tools are available to BSOs, detector dogs are highly efficient in their ability to accurately locate the source of a scent, and thus can save time in <b>labour-intensive</b> examinations of vehicles, luggage and cargo. This speeds up the process for BSOs as well as for the travelling public.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>labour-intensive</b> to manufacture, it {{is thought}} that, with good maintenance, they could be {{continually}} used for several decades. Its utility was such that the later appearance of the famous lorica segmentata—which afforded greater protection for {{a third of the}} weight—never led to the disappearance of the ubiquitous mail, and, in fact, the army of the late empire reverted to the lorica hamata once the segmentata had fallen out of fashion.|$|E
25|$|Insulin coma {{therapy was}} a <b>labour-intensive</b> {{treatment}} that required trained staff {{and a special}} unit. Patients, who were almost invariably diagnosed with schizophrenia, were {{selected on the basis}} of having a good prognosis and the physical strength to withstand an arduous treatment. There were no standard guidelines for treatment. Different hospitals and psychiatrists developed their own protocols. Typically, injections were administered six days a week for about two months.|$|E
25|$|Industrial {{relocation}} has, to some extent, {{contributed to}} the upgrade of industries. The <b>labour-intensive</b> industries of Hong Kong were turned into capital-intensive and technology-intensive industries. The relocated Mainland factories became more effective than before their relocation thus increasing the productivity of the manufacturers. From 1985 to 2004, the total amount made by such manufacturers rose from HK$208,000 to HK$942,000. Products produced in the Mainland are also more competitive due to low costs.|$|E
25|$|Industry {{has been}} {{historically}} {{important in the}} textile sector around Alcoy. Footwear still remains as the flagship industrial sector of the province, which occurs in Elche, Elda, Petrer and Villena, both <b>labour-intensive</b> footwear and, specially, textile are at a low ebb due to harsh competition from fast pace growing economies in Asia. The traditionally important toys industry around the Ibi and Onil area is another one competing internationally with those same areas.|$|E
