5|$|In 1881, a {{currency}} reform introduced a bimetallic standard, which {{went into effect}} in July 1883. Unlike many precious metal standards the system was very decentralized: no national monetary authority existed and all control over convertibility rested with the five banks of issue. The period of convertibility lasted only 17 months: from December 1884 the banks of issue refused to exchange gold at par for notes. The suspension of convertibility was soon accommodated by the government, since, having no institutional power over the monetary system, there was <b>little</b> <b>they</b> could do to prevent it.|$|E

The children {{make the best of}} what <b>little</b> <b>they</b> have, while their father works long hours doing odd jobs.|$|E
5|$|That {{same day}} British {{forces in the}} Mediterranean carried out Churchill's orders by attacking Ottoman {{shipping}} off of the port of İzmir. That night at an Ottoman Cabinet meeting, the Grand Vizier's anti-war faction was forced to accept that the Empire was at war, {{and that there was}} <b>little</b> <b>they</b> could do to avoid conflict. The Russians declared war on the Ottoman Empire on 2 November 1914. Admiral Andrei Eberhardt immediately ordered Russia's fleet to retaliate against the Ottomans for the raid. On 4 November, a Russian task force bombarded Zonguldak.|$|E

5|$|While the British {{remained}} firmly against separate Rhodesian {{representation in}} Lisbon, there was <b>little</b> <b>they</b> {{could do to}} stop it. Ross was nominally put on extended leave, but not withdrawn. Deciding that {{he could no longer}} wait for Bottomley to fulfil his promise to visit Rhodesia during October, Smith resolved to instead meet with Wilson personally in London, and arranged to travel on 3 October, arriving the next day. While Smith prepared to travel, Britain continued its frantic efforts to carry international anti-Rhodesian sentiment, among other things urging each NATO member government not to deal with Reedman. In London, Britons who sympathised with Smith came out to support him in large numbers, surprising both the British and the Rhodesians. The two Prime Ministers' talks were largely unproductive, and little common ground was found before Smith flew home on 12 October.|$|E
5|$|Manuel's {{attention}} was again drawn to Antioch in 1156, when Raynald of Châtillon, the new Prince of Antioch, {{claimed that the}} Byzantine emperor had reneged on his promise to pay him a sum of money and vowed to attack the Byzantine province of Cyprus. Raynald arrested {{the governor of the}} island, John Komnenos, who was a nephew of Manuel, and the general Michael Branas. The Latin historian William of Tyre deplored this act of war against fellow Christians and described the atrocities committed by Raynald's men in considerable detail. Having ransacked the island and plundered all its wealth, Raynald's army mutilated the survivors before forcing them to buy back their flocks at exorbitant prices with what <b>little</b> <b>they</b> had left. Thus enriched with enough booty to make Antioch wealthy for years, the invaders boarded their ships and set sail for home.* T. F. Madden, The New Concise History of the Crusades, 65 Raynald also sent some of the mutilated hostages to Constantinople as a vivid demonstration of his disobedience and his contempt for the Byzantine emperor.|$|E
5|$|Riker {{gets up to}} {{date with}} the situation, and decides that while Ramsey and his group are at large and refusing to leave the planet, there is <b>little</b> <b>they</b> can do. Before leaving they find that one of Beata's assistants, Ariel (Patricia McPherson), has married Ramsey, and was {{followed}} by Beata's guards to their camp, where they arrested the survivors and their families. The Away Team attempt to explain to Beata the reason for Ramsey's refusal to leave. Beata and her council reject his reasoning, and threatens to execute them the following day. After failing to convince Ramsey and his group to leave with them, Riker contacts the Enterprise, in hopes to transport Ramsey and his group without their consent (despite it being {{a violation of the}} Prime Directive, and almost certainly an end to his career), but Dr. Crusher (while treating an incapacitated Geordi in the Captain's chair) refuses to allow anyone to beam aboard for fear of being infected, but allows Data, as an android, to return. Riker orders Data to take command and get the Enterprise to the Neutral Zone before it's too late.|$|E

25|$|Early European {{visitors}} were {{amazed by the}} quality of Japanese craftsmanship and metalsmithing.

Thus, the Japanese were famously frugal with their consumable resources; what <b>little</b> <b>they</b> had they used with expert skill.|$|E

25|$|The {{citizens}} of the cotton States, as a whole, are poor.

Their destitution is not material only; it is intellectual and it is moral... They were neither generous nor hospitable and their talk was not that of evenly courageous men.|$|E
25|$|Drake and Carleill led a {{force of}} 600 men in a trek into the dry and arid hills of Santiago island. The {{inhabitants}} of São Domingos fled when the English approached, so Drake and his men looted what <b>little</b> <b>they</b> could, then burned the village to the ground. The English returned to the coast, shadowed as they went by local militia; two stragglers were intercepted, killed and mutilated.|$|E

25|$|The {{workplace}} regulations {{also brought}} in {{a new form of}} enforcement of the legislation. Under the Fire Precautions Act, Section 10 gave the fire brigade the power to close a premises if there was serious danger from fire; however, there was very <b>little</b> <b>they</b> could do to bring a premises up to standard. Section 4 of the Fire Precautions Act did give some limited powers to issue a 'Notice of Steps' to be taken to correct any defects.|$|E
25|$|The {{leaders of}} the {{movement}} saw themselves as developing the full potential economic, social and cultural potential within {{the people of the}} region. “But perhaps the most important reason why the Antigonish movement was able to have a significant, lasting impact was its promotion of credit unions” which delivered microfinance.

25|$|Ava now fully {{expected}} another major invasion. Hsinbyushin had now brought {{most of the}} troops back from Siam to face the Chinese. With the Burmese fully preoccupied with the Chinese threat, the Siamese resistance retook Ayutthaya in 1768 {{and went on to}} reconquer all of their territories throughout 1768 and 1769. For the Burmese, their hard-fought gains of the prior three years (1765–1767) in Siam had gone to waste but there was <b>little</b> <b>they</b> could do.

Nazirites were allowed to clean their hair or part it with their fingers, {{but they were not}} allowed to comb it.

25|$|After {{fending off}} the Spanish attack, the English counted the costs but found very <b>little,</b> <b>they</b> {{had only two}} killed and fifteen wounded principally from the Susan {{and there was no}} serious damage to any of their ships. They put into Algiers for supplies, and then {{successfully}} ran the gauntlet of a second group of Spanish galleys which was waiting for them in the Gibraltar straits.

25|$|The defeat {{caused a}} great shift in policy {{for many other}} states, as well. States which had until now been neutral joined with Sparta, {{assuming}} that Athens's defeat was imminent. Many of Athens' allies in the Delian League also revolted, and although the city immediately began to rebuild its fleet, there was <b>little</b> <b>they</b> could do about the revolts for the time being. The expedition and consequent disaster left Athens reeling. Some 10,000 hoplites had perished and, though this was a blow, the real concern was {{the loss of the}} huge fleet dispatched to Sicily. Triremes could be replaced, but the 30,000 experienced oarsmen lost in Sicily were irreplaceable and Athens had to rely on ill-trained slaves to form the backbone of her new fleet.|$|E
