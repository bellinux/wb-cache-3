5|$|Andreas Günter Lubitz {{was born}} on 18 December 1987 {{and grew up in}} Neuburg an der Donau, Bavaria and Montabaur in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. He took flying <b>lessons</b> <b>at</b> Luftsportclub Westerwald, an {{aviation}} sports club in Montabaur.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{the demand}} for {{education}} rose, especially for high school education. There was also a rising need to cater to {{students enrolled in the}} elementary schools affiliated to the Hokkien Hway Kuan. Thus, Nan Chiau Teachers' Training College was converted into a girls' high school, featuring a primary school section. Mr Yang Zhen Li was the first Principal of the institution, which had an initial student enrollment of 900. A female hostel was also built in the 1950s. By the 1960s, Nan Chiau Girls' High had gained {{reputation as one of the}} state's top high schools. In 1965, 2 million dollars was spent by the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan to rebuild Nan Chiau Girl's High School to meet the needs of an increased student enrollment. During the re-construction, the high school section conducted <b>lessons</b> <b>at</b> a temporary campus at Guillemard Road, whilst the primary school section continued <b>lessons</b> <b>at</b> the unaffected classroom blocks of the Kim Yam Road campus. The new campus was officially opened by then Minister for Education Mr. Ong Pang Boon, on 8 March 1969.|$|E
5|$|Filatov {{was born}} in Moscow, Russia, to parents Slava and Yelena.

5|$|In March 1915, Ball began a {{short-lived}} engagement to Dot Allbourne (or Ellbourne), {{though he was}} still interested in other girls such as Thelma Starr. In June, {{he decided to take}} private flying <b>lessons</b> <b>at</b> Hendon Aerodrome, which would give him an outlet for his interest in engineering and possibly help him to see action in France sooner. He paid to undertake pilot training in his own time at the Ruffy-Baumann School, which charged £75 to £100 for instruction (£5,580 to £7,440 in 2010 prices).|$|E
5|$|Mann {{grew up in}} Cheltenham, England. Mann also idolised Marco Ruas and Royce Gracie as {{a youngster}} after being {{introduced}} to the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Mann began taking Muay Thai <b>lessons</b> <b>at</b> the age of 11 and participated in jiu-jitsu and kickboxing tournaments {{at the age of}} 13. Mann competed in his first amateur fight at the age of 16 and turned professional a year later.|$|E

She dismissed her old drama coach, Natasha Lytess, and replaced her with Paula; the Strasbergs remained an important influence {{for the rest of}} her career. Monroe also started undergoing psychoanalysis at the recommendation of Strasberg, who believed that an actor must confront their emotional traumas and use them in their performances.|$|E

5|$|Keen {{to follow}} up his {{interest}} in aviation, Johnson started taking flying <b>lessons</b> <b>at</b> his own expense. He applied to join the Auxiliary Air Force (AAF) but encountered some of the social problems that were rife in British society at the time. Johnson strongly felt he was rejected {{on the grounds of}} his class status. Johnson's fortunes were to improve. As the chances of war increased {{in the aftermath of the}} Munich Crisis, the standards of the RAF were relaxed, however, as the service expanded and brought in men from ordinary social backgrounds. Johnson re-applied to the AAF. He was informed that sufficient pilots were already available but there were some vacancies in the balloon squadrons. Johnson rejected the offer.|$|E
5|$|Lena Meyer-Landrut {{was born}} in Hanover, Germany. She is the granddaughter of Andreas Meyer-Landrut, the Estonian-born West German {{ambassador}} to the Soviet Union in Moscow from 1980 to 1983 and 1987 to 1989 and Hanna Karatsony von Hodos who {{was born in}} Bratislava, Slovakia of Hungarian nobility. She grew up as an only child, and started taking dancing <b>lessons</b> <b>at</b> the age of five; initially doing ballet and later practising various modern styles, including hip-hop and jazz dance. Meyer-Landrut grew fond of singing and appeared as an extra in a number of German television series; however she never received any formal acting or vocal training. In June 2010 she graduated from IGS Roderbruch Hannover, a comprehensive school, receiving her Abitur diploma.|$|E
5|$|With {{the opening}} of the École supérieure d'aéronautique et de constructions mécaniques on 15 November 1909, Coandă moved to Paris. As a {{continuation}} of his Belgian experiments, and especially {{looking for a way to}} test wing aerofoils at higher speeds, he contacted Ernest Archdeacon, the co-founder of L'Aero-Club de France, who in turn directed Coandă to Gustav Eiffel and Paul Painlevé. With their assistance, he gained approval to test different wing configurations and air resistance on a platform built by Eiffel at the front of a locomotive on the North of France railway. In March, he started flying <b>lessons</b> <b>at</b> Reims in a Hanriot monoplane.|$|E

5|$|Born on 16 November 1945 in Brussels, van Hamel was the {{youngest}} of three siblings of Dutch parents. Her father, Diederik (Dick) Alfred van Hamel, was a diplomat stationed in Copenhagen. Her mother, Manette van Hamel (née Cramer), born in 1913 in Deventer, was a music teacher and violinist who played in a string quartet. Martine van Hamel began ballet <b>lessons</b> <b>at</b> the age of four in Copenhagen where it was common for children to study ballet. As a diplomat, her father was routinely stationed in different countries such as Denmark, the Netherlands, and Indonesia. It was difficult for her to find teachers but she took lessons when possible. While her father was stationed in Caracas, Venezuela, van Hamel, then age ten, took classes with Henry Danton from The Royal Ballet. Danton frequently guest taught at the National Ballet of Venezuela. In 1958, she moved to Canada to study at Canada's National Ballet School with Betty Oliphant.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, {{business}} issues forced Tibbets's family {{to return to}} Alton, Illinois, where he graduated from Western Military Academy in 1933. He then attended the University of Florida in Gainesville, and became an initiated member of the Epsilon Zeta Chapter of Sigma Nu fraternity in 1934. During that time, Tibbets took private flying <b>lessons</b> <b>at</b> Miami's Opa-locka Airport with Rusty Heard, who later became a captain at Eastern Airlines. After his undergraduate work, Tibbets had planned on becoming an abdominal surgeon. He transferred to the University of Cincinnati after his second year to complete his pre-med studies there, because the University of Florida had no medical school at the time. However, he attended for only {{a year and a}} half as he changed his mind about wanting to become a doctor. Instead, he decided to enlist in the United States Army and become a pilot in the United States Army Air Corps.|$|E
5|$|Lutosławski started {{piano lessons}} in Warsaw {{for two years}} {{from the age of}} six. After the Polish-Soviet War the family left Warsaw to return to Drozdowo, but after a few years of running the estates with limited success, his mother {{returned}} to Warsaw. She worked as a physician, and translated books for children from English. In 1924 Lutosławski entered secondary school (Stefan Batory Gymnasium) while continuing piano lessons. A performance of Karol Szymanowski's Third Symphony deeply affected him. In 1925 he started violin <b>lessons</b> <b>at</b> the Warsaw Music School. In 1931 he enrolled at Warsaw University to study mathematics, and in 1932 he formally joined the composition classes at the Conservatory. His only composition teacher was Witold Maliszewski, a renowned Polish composer who had been a pupil of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. Lutosławski was given a strong grounding in musical structures, particularly movements in sonata form. In 1932 he gave up the violin, and in 1933 he discontinued his mathematics studies to concentrate on the piano and composition. As a student of Jerzy Lefeld, he gained a diploma for piano performance from the Conservatory in 1936, after presenting a virtuoso program including Schumann's Toccata and Beethoven's fourth piano concerto. His diploma for composition was awarded by the same institution in 1937.|$|E

5|$|Soule {{was born}} in Keokuk, Iowa to a public school music teacher father and a graphic {{designer}} mother. He became interested in music and symphony orchestras {{at the age of}} five. Soule began taking piano <b>lessons</b> <b>at</b> an early age and became entranced with music, even writing music notation in the margins of his math homework; after his teachers and his father realized his talent, he began taking private lessons with professors from Western Illinois University when he was in sixth grade. He claims to have earned the equivalent of a master's degree in composition before completing high school, though, as he never enrolled in the school, he did not earn a degree. He was split between trying to become a concert pianist and a composer when he grew up; he ended up deciding to become a composer once he realized how difficult it would be to do both.|$|E
5|$|In 1849, after a year's probation, Stainer {{became a}} chorister at St Paul's Cathedral. He was already an {{accomplished}} player on keyboard instruments and possessed perfect pitch {{and a fine}} treble voice and soon became the choir's principal soloist. In 1854 {{he was invited to}} sing in the first English performance of Bach's St Matthew Passion under William Sterndale Bennett at the Hanover Square Rooms. He travelled each day between his home in Streatham and the cathedral by steamboat. The choristers were required to sing for services at 9.30 a.m. and 3.15 p.m. In between these times the choristers were instructed in Latin, arithmetic, writing and other subjects, and Stainer probably received a much better education there than he would have done had he been educated at the local elementary school. A house in the cathedral's present choir school has since been named after him. He received organ <b>lessons</b> <b>at</b> St. Sepulchre's Church, Holborn from George Cooper, assistant organist at St Paul's Cathedral under John Goss. He may have met future composer Arthur Sullivan, his junior by two years, there. At any rate they became friends and undertook activities together on half-holidays. In 1855 he was offered a six-month contract as organist at St Benet's, Paul's Wharf. He proved successful, and his contract was renewed several times for further six-month terms. As he was still a minor, his salary of £30 per year was paid to his father. During this period, he sometimes deputised for the regular organists, Goss and Cooper, at services in St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E
