5|$|Chapter 27 is a 2007 biographical film {{depicting}} {{the murder of}} John Lennon by Mark David Chapman. It was {{written and directed by}} Jarrett Schaefer, based on the book <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Take</b> You Down by Jack Jones, produced by Robert Salerno, and stars Jared Leto as Chapman. The film takes place in December 1980, and is intended to be an exploration of Chapman's psyche.|$|E
25|$|Following the murder, and for {{the first}} six years in Attica, Chapman refused all {{requests}} for interviews. James R. Gaines interviewed him and wrote a three-part, 18,000-word People magazine series in February and March 1987. Chapman told the parole board he regretted the interview. Chapman later gave a series of audio-taped interviews to Jack Jones of the Democrat and Chronicle. In 1992 Jones published a book, <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Take</b> You Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman, the Man Who Killed John Lennon.|$|E
500|$|Finn's {{men were}} trying to fight back by using the machine guns mounted in the PBYs, either by firing from inside the flaming planes or by {{detaching}} the guns and mounting them on improvised stands. Finn later explained {{that one of the}} first things he did was to take control of a machine gun from his squadron's painter. [...] "I said, 'Alex, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>take</b> that gun'... knew that I had more experience firing a machine gun than a painter." ...|$|E

[...] "I can't {{see it now}} of course, but I like to feel it in my pocket, {{and it will be}} {{the first}} thing I shall look at when the doctor <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> <b>take</b> off these beastly glasses--if ever he does. Until then--well, I like to feel I've got it. That's all!" ...|$|R

Girls work much faster. They finish in half that time. The boss is kind. He <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> <b>take</b> the work home, now that I am old and {{the noise of the}} machine bothers my head. If it wasn't for his kindness, I'd starve.|$|R
500|$|Ahead of {{the second}} season, Fazekas {{explained}} that after Carter turned Sousa {{down at the end}} of the first season, saying [...] "Oh, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>take</b> a rain check. I have something to do", Carter felt like a potential relationship was something she could consider, while Sousa [...] "felt like he missed an opportunity there." [...] Because of that, Sousa moved to Los Angeles to avoid Carter, and [...] "They haven’t spoken since he left. There’s that interesting awkward [...] when they start working together again. But now Sousa has got a girlfriend and it’s very serious, so that’s a new thing for Peggy to deal with." [...] Though Sousa and Carter do eventually get together in the second season finale, the executive producers warned that this did not necessarily mean Sousa is Carter's future husband, who was first mentioned in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.|$|E
500|$|The real Mark David Chapman is {{currently}} incarcerated at Wende Correctional Facility, on a guilty plea. Aside from two interviews with Larry King and Barbara Walters, both in 1992, {{he has not}} spoken with the media. However, Chapman did reveal the mechanics of his unraveling during those three days in New York City to journalist Jack Jones. The interviews were published in 1992 as <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Take</b> You Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman, a book of Chapman's recollections of his act of violence. Chapter 27 is based on this text. The title [...] "Chapter 27" [...] suggests a continuation of J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has 26 chapters, and which Chapman was carrying when he shot John Lennon. Chapman was obsessed with the book, {{to the point of}} attempting to model his life after its protagonist, Holden Caulfield.|$|E
500|$|Halifax {{started off}} Game 5 {{at home on}} a low note, with Liam McMorrow {{committing}} four personal fouls {{in the first three}} minutes. Nevertheless, Halifax pulled away with the 125–91 victory, putting them one win away from the title. Rainmen forward Forrest Fisher complained about Windsor, [...] "They're playing very physical, and at times a little bit dirty with sucker punches, and we started playing into their game (Friday) and that's not us. A couple of us can play like that, myself included, and we came out tonight and I told them 'hey, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>take</b> the hits, I'm used to that. You guys play your normal game.' We play the way we play, and it doesn't matter how they play." [...] According to The Chronicle Herald, [...] "the game featured several incidents that threatened to escalate into a full-scale brawl." [...] The teams' coaches would frequently have to break up skirmishes and confront officials for what they felt were bad calls.|$|E

500|$|An African hip hop and hip hop song, {{the track}} {{was written by}} the two musicians while {{production}} was handled by disc jockey CedSolo. The recording lyrically finds Sarkodie discussing that he's the [...] "new guy" [...] in the music industry. [...] "New Guy" [...] displays Sarkodie and Ace Hood alternate verses atop several synth chords and military drum-like sounds, which drew comparisons to {{the works of the}} track's producer, CedSolo. Sarkodie sings during the track's refrain: [...] "Ace, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>take</b> you to Africa / My people, they'll love you". He also believes that his music is for the Ghanaian people and has the motivation to become a leader in the industry: [...] "So I grind Sunday to Monday / Because there's no role models, there's no true leaders left / So it's up to me to make sure the world know that I'm that new guy / I'm that inspiration".|$|E

2500|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>take</b> {{you back}} to the winter of 1938: then as a young man, full of hope and {{ambition}} to play cricket for my county, I travelled from my place of work in the City of London to a sports complex at Leytonstone where Jack O'Connor and Stan Nichols looked after the cricketing side of the organisation. Arranging to practice in the nets three evenings a week, under the direction ot these two fine Essex and England cricketers, seemed to be an excellent way in which to get noticed and known in Essex cricketing circles, especially as previously I had been playing my cricket outside the county. It was, in effect, a planned exercise, designed to make things happen, which continued right through to the spring of 1939 when I was finally invited to a trial at Woodford Wells. The planned exercise worked! ...|$|E
