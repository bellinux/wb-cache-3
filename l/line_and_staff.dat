25|$|Chandler (1965) {{demonstrates}} that the large-scale problems of management became obvious {{in the middle of}} the 19th century with the rise of the great railroad systems, such as the Pennsylvania and the Baltimore and Ohio. New methods had to be invented for mobilizing, controlling, and apportioning capital, for operating a widely dispersed system, and for supervising thousands of specialized workmen spread over hundreds of miles. The railroads solved all these problems and became the model for all large businesses. The main innovators were three engineers, Benjamin H. Latrobe of the Baltimore and Ohio, Daniel C. McCallum of the Erie, and Thomson of the Pennsylvania. They devised the functional departments and first defined the lines of authority, responsibility, and communication with the concomitant separation of <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>staff</b> duties which have remained the principles of the modern American corporation.|$|E

50|$|Because {{of diverse}} {{positions}} and sorts of power {{inside of a}} line-and-staff association, rivalry {{in the middle of}} <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>staff</b> faculty is practically unpreventable. Though insignificant clash because of contrasts in perspectives is characteristic, clash with respect to <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>staff</b> faculty can upset a whole association. There is a large number of possible reasons for a conflict between the <b>Line</b> <b>and</b> <b>Staff</b> Function. Poor human relations, covering power and obligation, and abuse of staff faculty by top administration are all essential explanations behind sentiments of hatred in the middle of <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>staff</b> work force. This hatred can bring about different divisions seeing the association from a tight position as opposed to taking a gander at the association overall.|$|E

Research estimates 50 % to 90 % of the current investment in training yields little or no value. Research has also shown barriers exist that interfere with the transfer of training from the classroom to the work environment; yet, minimal comparisons have been made between managers <b>and</b> <b>line</b> <b>staff</b> in the transfer of training literature. ^ This study investigated how organizations <b>and</b> <b>staff</b> development functions can improve the likelihood that knowledge gained in training will transfer from the classroom to the job site for both managers <b>and</b> <b>line</b> <b>staff.</b> ^ Surveys were mailed to 605 public sector employees that attended Public Service Excellence Program training. One hundred and fifty-six surveys were analyzed: 58 from managers <b>and</b> 98 from <b>line</b> <b>staff.</b> ^ Using factor analysis, three scales were developed to retrospectively measure trainee 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions of task/situational supports; three scales measured perceptions of social supports, and one scale measured perceptions of training outcomes. Survey items were re-configured to create three additional scales that measured retrospective perceptions of supports given before, during, and after training. ^ A 2 x 4 ANOVA was {{used to analyze the}} data comparing organizational position (managers versus <b>line</b> <b>staff)</b> <b>and</b> four points in time since training (6, 10, 12, and 14 months). Post hoc analysis using the Scheffe Method and Independent samples t-tests at the item level were conducted to examine differences. ^ The results confirmed significant differences, with small effect sizes, between managers 2 ̆ 7 <b>and</b> <b>line</b> <b>staff</b> 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions of time to apply training; perceived value of training; upper management support, immediate supervisor support, and training outcomes. There were also significant differences, with small effect sizes, between managers 2 ̆ 7 <b>and</b> <b>line</b> <b>staff</b> 2 ̆ 7 s retrospective perceptions of supports given before, during, and after training. There {{were no significant differences between}} managers 2 ̆ 7 <b>and</b> <b>line</b> <b>staff</b> 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions of control over the job and co-worker support. Significant differences between times since training appeared to be the result of work place characteristics rather than time. ...|$|R
