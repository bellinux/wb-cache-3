5|$|Both teams' {{responses}} to Liverpool's third goal {{were to make}} substitutions in the final quarter of the game. Liverpool defender Rob Jones was swapped for striker Ian Rush and Newcastle's Darren Peacock was changed for Steve Howey in order to tighten up the Newcastle defence. As the match looked <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> in a draw, in stoppage time Rush and John Barnes began to play a series of one-twos towards the Newcastle end. Barnes passed the ball to Collymore in a space on the left flank; Collymore kicked it past Srníček to score his second goal of the game, which prompted jubilant scenes in the Liverpool Kop. In contrast, Keegan slumped over the advertising hoardings in distress.|$|E
5|$|Models by Julio Ángel Fernández {{suggest that}} the {{scattered}} disc, which is the main source for periodic comets in the Solar System, might also be the primary source for Oort cloud objects. According to the models, {{about half of the}} objects scattered travel outward toward the Oort cloud, whereas a quarter are shifted inward to Jupiter's orbit, and a quarter are ejected on hyperbolic orbits. The scattered disc might still be supplying the Oort cloud with material. A third of the scattered disc's population is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> up in the Oort cloud after 2.5billion years.|$|E
5|$|Youkilis is an on-base machine. He never swings at a bad pitch, and is {{adept at}} working counts and out-thinking the pitcher. Unlike some guys who draw lots of walks, Youkilis seldom strikes out. He makes solid contact against both fastballs and {{breaking}} pitches. Youkilis' swing is tailored for the line drive, {{and he may}} never hit for much home run power. But he hits balls to the gaps effectively, and could develop 10–14 home run power down the road. Youkilis does not have very good speed, though he is a decent baserunner. His defense at third base draws mixed reviews. His arm, range, and hands all rate as adequate/average. He doesn't kill the defense at third base, but he doesn't help it much, either, and is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> up at first base down the road.|$|E

25|$|When P.clarus males {{compete for}} females, the winners {{are those that}} produce the most {{vibrations}} {{on the surface and}} those that are largest. Contests between females involve less displaying, and physical fights between females are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> in injury or death. The most successful males choose the largest females, as these produce the most eggs and most quickly. If a female that has mated already then finds a larger male, she will often mate again with the larger male. The average clutch is 135eggs. Unlike most of the genus Phidippus, P.clarus females die after one brood has left the nest.|$|E
25|$|The party {{designated}} {{transfer system}} of vote management is applicable only to systems that allow group voting.

25|$|Having lost {{eight seconds}} to Contador {{in the first}} day's {{individual}} time trial, Froome ceded even more time {{to him on the}} third stage, when the Spaniard broke away from the peloton during the uphill finish to win the stage. Now 27 seconds behind Contador, with only one mountain stage remaining, Froome seemed <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> up second. But on the penultimate fourth stage, which had a steep uphill finish, Team Sky worked hard and dropped all of Contador's Tinkoff-Saxo teammates as the leaders reached the final climb. After some punchy moves by his support riders, Froome began a solo attack. For a short time Contador was able to follow, but he soon fell away. Froome won the stage and was able to open a 29-second gap on second-place Contador by the finish line, enough to overcome his deficit and take the overall race lead by two seconds. The final fifth stage was relatively flat, with no likely chance for Contador to make up his deficit, allowing Froome to collect his first stage race victory since May 2014. This was the third year in a row that Froome won his season opener stage race.|$|E

25|$|A 2008 {{study by}} Jenifer L. Bratter and Rosalind B. King {{conducted}} {{on behalf of}} the Education Resources Information Center examined whether crossing racial boundaries increased the risk of divorce. Using the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth (Cycle VI), the likelihood of divorce for interracial couples to that of same-race couples was compared. Comparisons across marriage cohorts revealed that, overall, interracial couples have higher rates of divorce, particularly for those that married during the late 1980s. The authors found that gender plays a significant role in interracial divorce dynamics: According to the adjusted models predicting divorce as of the 10th year of marriage, interracial marriages that are the most vulnerable involve White females and non-White males relative to White/White couples. White wife/Black husband marriages {{are twice as likely to}} divorce by the 10th year of marriage compared to White/White couples, while White wife/Asian husband marriages are 59% more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> in divorce compared to White/White unions. Conversely, White men/non-White women couples show either very little or no differences in divorce rates. Asian wife/White husband marriages show only 4% greater likelihood of divorce by the 10th year of marriage than White/White couples. In the case of Black wife/White husband marriages, divorce by the 10th year of marriage is 44% less likely than among White/White unions. Intermarriages that did not cross a racial barrier, which was the case for White/Hispanic White couples, showed statistically similar likelihoods of divorcing as White/White marriages.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of World War I, Wilding joined the Royal Marines on advice of Winston Churchill who was then First Lord of the Admiralty. He was gazetted a second lieutenant in early October 1914. Wilding remained in the Marines {{for just a few}} days and was then attached to the Intelligence Corps due to his intimate knowledge of the continent and his skills as a motorist. At the end of October he joined the Royal Naval Armoured Car Division in the battlefields of northern France where he had thirty men, three guns and armoured cars under his command. After a week's leave in London in February 1915 he returned to France on 16 March 1915 and was posted to a new squadron made up of armoured Rolls Royce cars under the command of the Duke of Westminster. He was ranked a lieutenant. Before long the squadron was moved near the front and on 2 May Wilding received notice of his promotion to captain. In his last letter dated 8 May he wrote [...] "For really the first time in seven and a half months I have a job on hand which is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> in gun, I, and the whole outfit being blown to hell.

500|$|On {{its initial}} broadcast, the episode was watched by 2.998 million viewers. It {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics, with TV Guide ranking the episode No. 95 in its 2009 list of [...] "TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time". BuddyTV's Don Williams deemed the finale [...] "absolutely fantastic", and ranked it tenth {{on his list}} of the top Supernatural episodes {{of the first three}} seasons. Although he [...] "respected the show for having the guts to follow through with [...] deal"—the ending was a [...] "complete jaw-dropper"—he pointed out the previous times the Winchesters have died and were subsequently resurrected. Memorable moments for Williams include Sam and Dean singing [...] "Wanted Dead or Alive", and Dean admitting that his love for Sam is his main weakness. Likewise, TV Guides Tina Charles described the episode as [...] "creepy and suspenseful and funny and sad and just plain awesome", and felt it came close to outdoing the first-season finale [...] "Devil's Trap". Especially praised were the actors' performances. Padalecki [...] "totally {{stepped up to the plate}} and knocked one out of the park", and Ackles was [...] "nine kinds of awesome". On the latter, Charles noted, [...] "From acting out Dean's stubborn ways, his inappropriate humor, those crushing looks of despair and doom and Dean's death, the man can play it all." [...] McCormick was described as [...] "creepy", leading to Charles' [...] "huge compliment" [...] of comparing the episode to The Twilight Zone. For the critic, the [...] "totally unexpected" [...] Bon Jovi sing-along [...] "totally rocked" [...] and has [...] "instantly become a classic".
