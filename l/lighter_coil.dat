50|$|Enduro Rupp first {{released}} the Enduro model in 1970. The Enduro was {{identical to the}} Scrambler however it came with a 4 HP Tecumseh HS40 (with no <b>lighting</b> <b>coil)</b> for increased power.

40|$|The {{experimental}} research here presented {{is aimed at}} describing some aspects of a process of energy conversion, from thermal to mechanical. This conversion, induced by a hot plate over which a <b>light</b> <b>coil</b> is free to rotate {{as a consequence of}} the temperature gradient determined in the fluid medium, is then used as an indicator to acquire some knowledge about the flow field in the fluid itself. The results obtained are not only affected by the thermal fluid dynamic conditions of the whole system but also by the tracer utilised, that is the <b>light</b> <b>coil,</b> with its shape and its properties. Among them the weight, the effect of which on the angular velocity induced in the coil is here investigated by means of an experimental setup. The results, requesting a dualistic interpretation, show that the influence of the weight has to be considered together with a rotational stability analysis. Further research is in progress...|$|R

The engine remained a 3.5 HP Tecumseh H35 but lost its <b>lighting</b> <b>coil,</b> thus the Scrambler lost its {{front and rear}} lights. Instead of a headlight the Scrambler was outfitted with a racing number plate which often sported a Rupp decal, most commonly reading, [...] "Live it RUPP." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{vibration}} galvanometer {{is a type}} of mirror galvanometer, usually with a coil suspended in the gap of a magnet or with a permanent magnet suspended in the field of an electromagnet. The natural oscillation frequency of the moving parts is carefully tuned to a specific frequency; commonly 50 or 60 Hz. Higher frequencies up to 1 kHz are possible. Since the frequency depends on the mass of the moving elements, high frequency {{vibration galvanometer}}s are very small with <b>light</b> <b>coils</b> and mirrors. The tuning of the vibration galvanometer is done by adjusting the tension of the suspension spring.|$|R
5000|$|Roadster - Many {{changes were}} made to the Roadster in 1970. It now used the new Rupp frame with the slanted engine plate and {{diaphragm}} carburetor. The wheels were upgraded from the 6" [...] turbine style to a new 10" [...] chrome wire wheel. The engine size was decreased from the 5 HP Tecumseh H50 to a 4 HP Tecumseh HS40. The engine had a <b>lighting</b> <b>coil</b> and still ran lights front and rear. The Roadster had front and rear drum brakes. Rupp marketed the Roadster as street legal. (ref) The Roadster, Enduro and Scrambler were available in blue, orange or red. All had silver gas tanks and silver engines.|$|R

50|$|Black Widow - Perhaps {{the most}} famous of all Rupp mini bikes was {{introduced}} in 1971—the Black Widow. The Black Widow differed from the other Rupps offered in 1971 in a variety of ways. The Widow was outfitted with a Tecumseh HS40 without a <b>lighting</b> <b>coil,</b> similar to the Enduro, however it came with a Dell'Orto carburetor for increased performance. The Black Widow also came with a chrome straight pipe exhaust and motocross tires. It was also the only Rupp in '71 to have chrome front and rear fenders. As its name suggests it was offered in black only. It was marketed as an off-road racing machine and claimed to be the best in its class.|$|R

50|$|Many {{types of}} chart {{recorders}} use a galvanometer {{to drive the}} marking device. A <b>light</b> <b>coil</b> of wire suspended in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet deflects {{in proportion to the}} current through it; instead of the pointer and scale of a direct-reading meter, the recorder deflects a pen or other marking device. The writing mechanism may be a heated needle writing on heat-sensitive paper or a simple hollow ink-fed pen. If the pen is continuously pressed against the paper, the galvanometer must be strong enough to move the pen against the friction of the paper. To lessen the strain on the galvanometer the pen might instead only intermittently be pressed against the writing medium, to make an impression, and then move while pressure is released.|$|R

5000|$|The siphon {{recorder}} {{works on the}} principle of a d'Arsonval galvanometer. A <b>light</b> <b>coil</b> of wire is suspended between the poles of a permanent magnet so it can turn freely. [...] The coil is attached via two wire linkages to the metal plate siphon support, which pivots on a horizontal suspension thread. From this plate a narrow glass siphon tube hangs down vertically with its end almost touching a paper tape. The paper tape is pulled by motorized rollers at a constant speed under the siphon pen. Ink is drawn up from a reservoir into the tube by siphon action and comes out a tiny orifice in the end of the siphon tube, drawing a line down the moving paper tape. In order not to affect the motion of the coil, the siphon tube itself never touches the paper, only the ink.|$|R
5000|$|Since the {{requirements}} of a full-range driver include both good low and high frequency response (which are contradictory in terms of physical construction), a full-range driver is usually limited to covering the audio spectrum above perhaps 100 Hz—leaving lower frequencies to be handled / augmented by a separate sub woofer or by a special cabinet design for low frequency reinforcement. These requirements usually mean that the full-range must have good sensitivity (for lower frequencies) with a <b>light</b> voice <b>coil</b> (for high frequencies) [...] - [...] these speakers commonly use a larger or more powerful magnet than usual, which improves sensitivity and thus lowers the power requirement at low frequencies as well as allowing a <b>lighter</b> voice <b>coil.</b> In addition, many have limited maximum excursions, requiring special enclosures which do not require large excursions at low frequencies for reasonable low end output.|$|R
2500|$|The {{moving coil}} driver, more {{commonly}} referred to as a [...] "dynamic" [...] driver is the most common type used in headphones. [...] It consists of a stationary magnet element affixed to the frame of the headphone which sets up a static magnetic field. The magnet in headphones is typically composed of ferrite or neodymium. [...] A voice <b>coil,</b> a <b>light</b> <b>coil</b> of wire, is suspended in the magnetic field of the magnet, attached to a diaphragm, typically fabricated from lightweight, high-stiffness-to-mass-ratio cellulose, polymer, carbon material, paper or the like. [...] When the varying current of an audio signal is passed through the coil, it creates a varying magnetic field which reacts against the static magnetic field, exerting a varying force on the coil causing it and the attached diaphragm to vibrate back and forth. The vibrating diaphragm pushes on the air producing sound waves.|$|R

This light effect, which displays spectral responses characteristic of chlorophyll-mediated mechanisms, is increased by at least 8 hours of prior dark incubation of plants from which the tendrils were derived. Considerable evidence indicates a major role of ATP in coiling. For example, inhibitors of ATP production decrease contact coiling. Exogenous ATP increases curvature in the dark, whereas exogenous adenosine, AMP and ADP are practically without effect. The ATP effect can be reversed {{by the addition of}} sucrose to the bathing solution. Tendrils of plants placed in the dark overnight have lower ATP levels than those held in the light. One half hour after stimulation, the endogenous ATP level of tendrils on plants kept in the light decreased fourfold. In the same period, the endogenous inorganic phosphate level increased markedly, indicating high adenosine triphosphatase activity...|$|R

40|$|The {{thermodynamic}} {{effect of}} a density gradient in a colder fluid {{as a result of}} a hotter plate located below it is something that is well known. However, its use as a flow field indicator using a <b>light</b> <b>coil</b> shaped body is a recent application developed by the author of this paper. The paper contributes to bring ahead this concept by a parametrical experimental analysis aimed at assessing the relationship among three of the parameters that mainly influence the whole process: the angular velocity of the coil as a dependent variable; the number of turns in the coil as the first independent variable and the weight of the coil as the second independent variable. A suitable apparatus was realized. The tests performed showed that, apart from a very few cases, an increase in the number of turns produces an increase in the angular velocity of the coil. A particular behaviour is observed for the weight of the coil: an increase in weight augments the angular velocity for small values, while for larger values the trend is opposite. Some considerations about the rotational stability can explain the entire concept, although further research will help deepen our knowledge of the process for wider parametrical ranges...|$|R

In ribbon microphones, a light metal ribbon is suspended between the poles of a magnet. As the ribbon vibrates, a voltage is induced at right angles to both the ribbon velocity and magnetic field direction and is picked off by contacts at the ends of the ribbon. Ribbon microphones are also called [...] "velocity microphones" [...] because the induced voltage is proportional to the velocity of the ribbon and thus of the air particles in the sound wave, unlike in some other microphones where the voltage is proportional to the displacement of {{the diaphragm}} and the air.|$|R

The coiled-coil filament evaporates more slowly than a straight filament of the same surface area and light-emitting power. As a result, the filament can then run hotter, which results in a more efficient light source, while reducing the evaporation so that the filament will last longer than a straight filament at the same temperature.|$|R

50|$|Electric {{utilities}} {{have discovered}} that this basic principle can save utility companies, and their customers, {{a significant amount of}} money. Utilities are able to shave the peak of their power demand curves by reducing the voltage across their distribution system. When a utility reaches a point where power demand is expected to exceed supply, utilities only have two options. Either purchase power from another utility, usually at substantial prices, or reduce demand. Often utilities use load management systems to turn off customers' air conditioners, water heaters, and pool pumps to reduce demand. Voltage reduction has become another option for utilities to reduce demand - typically unbeknownst to the customer. However, only the resistive portion of the load responds to the reduction in voltage to reduce aggregate demand. Loads such as incandescent <b>lights</b> and heater <b>coils</b> will use less power as the voltage is lowered. On the other hand, induction motor loads are unaffected by the reduction in voltage, because the current simply rises to account for no change or even a slight increase in power consumption.|$|R

In this chapter, we discuss this system in <b>light</b> of existing <b>coiled</b> coil structures and in applying rules to coiled coils that are to be designed or optimized. Understanding and expanding on these rules is crucial in using these motifs, which play key roles in virtually every cellular process, to act as drug-delivery agents by sequestering other proteins that are not behaving natively or that have been upregulated (for example, by binding to coiled coil domains implicated in oncogenesis). The roles of the a and d “hydrophobic” core positions and the e and g “electrostatic” edge positions in directing oligomerization and pairing specificity are discussed.

TFIIH is composed of eight or nine subunits and we show that at least four of them, namely cdk 7, cyclin H, MAT 1, and p 62 are localized in the coiled body, a distinct subnuclear structure that is transcription dependent and highly enriched in small nuclear ribonucleoproteins. Although coiled bodies do not correspond to sites of transcription, in vivo incorporation of bromo-UTP shows that they are surrounded by transcription foci. Immunofluorescence analysis using antibodies directed against the essential repair factors proliferating cell nuclear antigen and XPG did not reveal labeling of the coiled body in either untreated cells or cells irradiated with UV <b>light,</b> arguing that <b>coiled</b> bodies are probably not involved in DNA repair mechanisms.

40|$|Nowadays, {{there is}} growing {{interest}} in using superconducting wires or tapes for the design and manufacture of devices such as cables, coils, rotating machinery, transformers and fault current limiters among others. Their high current capacity has made them the candidates of choice for manufacturing compact and <b>light</b> cables and <b>coils</b> {{that can be used}} in the large scale power applications described above. However, the performance of these cables and coils is limited by their critical current, which is determined by several factors, including the conductor's material properties and the geometric layout of the device itself. In this work we present a self-consistent model for estimating the critical current of superconducting devices. This is of large importance when the operating conditions are such that the self-field produced by the current is comparable to the overall background field. The model is based on the asymptotic limit when time approaches infinity of Faraday's equation written in terms of the magnetic vector potential. It uses a continuous E-J relationship and takes the angular dependence of the critical current density on the magnetic flux density into account. The proposed model is used to estimate the critical current of superconducting devices such as cables, coils, and coils made of transposed cables with very high accuracy. The high computing speed of this model makes it an ideal candidate for design optimization...|$|R
