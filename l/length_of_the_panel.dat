40|$|AbstractDiaphragm {{walls are}} {{generally}} constructed using stiff concrete of same stiffness throughout. Research {{has shown that}} as wall flexibility increases, the stress imposed by the soil redistribute and reduces structural forces on wall. Approximately five fold reduction in maximum bending moment occurred when wall stiffness was reduced {{from that of a}} 1 m concrete section to that of a Frodinghamn 1 N sheet pile. Unfortunately this beneficial effect is accompanied by greater wall and soil movements (Potts & Day, 1991). So the diaphragm wall cannot be too flexible also. In this paper static analysis of two different diaphragm wall sections of varying stiffness is carried out using PLAXIS software for the load condition existing at deep draft berth of New Mangalore Port, and the performances of these sections are compared with previous study performed by Yajnheswaran et al.

40|$|Computations were {{performed}} {{to determine the effect}} of an overall bow-type imperfection on the reliability of structural panels under combined compression and shear loadings. A panel's reliability is the probability that it will perform the intended function - in this case, carry a given load without buckling or exceeding in-plane strain allowables. For a panel loaded in compression, a small initial bow can cause large bending stresses that reduce both the buckling load and the load at which strain allowables are exceeded; hence, the bow reduces the reliability of the panel. In this report, analytical studies on two stiffened panels quantified that effect.

In this paper, the construction sequence of a typical diaphragm wall panel in stiff clay is fully simulated using a three-dimensional finite difference program. Computed results are compared with some reported results of centrifuge model tests and relevant case histories.

40|$|The {{radiation}} efficiency of an infinite flat panel that radiates a plane wave into a half space {{is equal to}} the inverse of the cosine of the angle between the direction of propagation of the plane wave and the normal to the panel.

40|$|In {{recent years}} it has become {{apparent}} that we must take unobservable heterogeneity into account when conducting empirical consumer demand analysis. This paper is concerned with integrability (that is, whether demand is consistent with utility maximization) of the conditional mean demand (that is, the estimated demand) when allowing for unobservable heterogeneity. Integrability is impor-tant because it is necessary {{in order for the}} demand system estimates to be used for welfare analysis. Conditions for conditional mean demand to be integrable in the presence of unobservable heterogene-ity are developed in the literature. There is, however, little empirical evidence suggesting whether these conditions for integrability are likely to be met in the data or not. In this paper we exploit the fact that the integrability conditions have testable implications for panel data and use a unique long panel data set to test them. Because of the sizeable longitudinal <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>panel,</b> we are able to identify a very flexible specification of unobservable heterogeneity: We model individual demands as an Almost Ideal Demand system and allow for unobservable heterogeneity by allowing all intercept and slope parameters of the demand system to be individual-specific.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to test forward-looking {{incentives}} against backward-looking incentives. Design/methodology/approach ? Wage growth model to estimate forward-looking effects of unpaid overtime and a probit model of participation in unpaid overtime controlling for excessive pay to estimate backward-looking effects. The authors use data form the OSA labour supply panel (years 1994, 1996 and 1998). Findings ? The importance of backward-looking incentives is demonstrated in an empirical analysis of participation in unpaid overtime. The authors show that employees who have relatively good wages now or who have had relatively good wages in the recent past participate more often in unpaid overtime. The authors also show that participation in unpaid overtime does not lead to extra wage growth. Research limitations/implications ? These results imply that involvement in unpaid overtime is to be explained from backward-looking incentives, not from forward-looking incentives. The paper concludes that backward-looking incentives deserve more attention in the economic literature, especially as they are well-accepted as work motivation devices by employees. Limitations are the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> study (four years) and the fact that the data are restricted to one country (the Netherlands). Social implications ? Personnel policies should focus more on the intrinsic motivation of personnel rather than on extrinsic motivation. Originality/value ?

30|$|Since this is {{a dynamic}} model, two {{additional}} complications need to be solved {{in order to receive}} consistent estimates: the initial conditions problem and the necessity of separating the effect of unobserved individual characteristics from the possible effect of structural state dependence. The first problem is related {{to the fact that we}} are unable to observe the data generating process from its beginning for all individuals. That is, some individuals have previous experience of welfare participation that is not accounted for in the initial year of the observed series, which generates a conditional relationship causing inconsistent estimates of the parameters of interest. If the process is in equilibrium or if the previous experience is independent and exogenous of the behavior observed during the first time period, then there is no problem. However, this is unlikely to be the case. The problem of the initial conditions declines with the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>panel,</b> but the panel length in this study is only ten time periods, something that requires special attention. Heckman (1981 b) proposes a statistical approximation method that solves the problem with reasonable precision. 6 This is done by approximating the initial state in the sample using a univariate probit model, estimating its parameter separately and allowing its error term to freely correlate with the error terms of the remaining time periods and thereby circumvent the endogeneity problem. Here the initial state equation is estimated simultaneously with the participation equation.|$|E

40|$|The maximum {{likelihood}} estimator (MLE) in nonlinear panel data models with fixed effects is widely understood (with a few exceptions) {{to be biased}} and inconsistent when T, the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>panel,</b> is small and fixed. However, there is surprisingly little theoretical or empirical evidence {{on the behavior of}} the estimator on which to base this conclusion. The received studies have focused almost exclusively on coefficient estimation in two binary choice models, the probit and logit models. In this note, we use Monte Carlo methods to examine the behavior of the MLE of the fixed effects tobit model. We find that the estimator's behavior is quite unlike that of the estimators of the binary choice models. Among our findings are that the location coefficients in the tobit model, unlike those in the probit and logit models, are unaffected by the “incidental parameters problem. ” But, a surprising result related to the disturbance variance emerges instead - the finite sample bias appears here rather than in the slopes. This has implications for estimation of marginal effects and asymptotic standard errors, which are also examined in this paper. The effects are also examined for the probit and truncated regression models, extending the range of received results in the first of these beyond the widely cited biases in the coefficient estimators.

From the observation, increasing <b>the</b> debonding strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> core-face interface, the failure mode changed from debonding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> core-face interface to <b>the</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> face. The experimental results show that mechanical properties were improved when span decreased and also depends on core materials. Thus, <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> core materials and span <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sandwich <b>panels</b> has been evaluated...|$|R
