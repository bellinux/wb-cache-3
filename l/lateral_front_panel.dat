50|$|A common concern when {{swapping}} motherboards with an aftermarket unit is the <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> I/O connector. This <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> connector for the Dell XPS 730 and 730X chassis uses an USB-like interface, {{though the}} pins are different for the <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> (power switch, power light, hdd light, etc.).|$|R
50|$|Q-Connector or ASUS Q-Connector, is an adapter, {{sometimes}} {{included with}} ASUS motherboards, which sits {{in between the}} motherboard <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> connectors and the <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> cables. The Q-Connector is marked with bigger text than the <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> connectors on the motherboard, as well as protruding from the motherboard, limiting obstruction from heatsinks and other connectors.|$|R
50|$|The {{microcontroller}} communicates {{with its}} environment usign two serial ports. The first serial port {{is connected to}} the MIDI interface. The second serial port {{is connected to the}} <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> circuit board. The <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> has its own microcontroller, used to control the LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) and the various push-buttons, knobs and potentiometers on the <b>front</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Intel {{warns that}} HDA dongles {{should be used}} with HDA motherboards: It is {{strongly}} recommended that motherboard designers only use Intel HD Audio analog <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> dongles with the Intel HD Audio analog <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> header {{to insure that the}} jack detection and dynamic re-tasking capability is preserved. Passive AC’97 analog <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> dongles (ones which leave the 5V Analog pin-7 line unconnected on the dongle) may be used with the Intel HD Audio analog <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> header. But note that the <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> jack detection and re-tasking functionality will be lost as the AC’97 jacks cannot support connection to the SENSE line. In addition, software must be aware that an AC’97 dongle is being used with an Intel HD Audio analog header since the software might need to dedicate codec ports that are connected to the header to meet the product’s intended functionality.|$|R
50|$|Early PDP-8 systems did {{not have}} an {{operating}} system, just a <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> and run and halt switches. Software development systems for the PDP-8 series began with the most basic <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> entry of raw binary machine code (booting entry).|$|R

In such an installation the oven <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> occupies a similar profile as a cabinet door. Accordingly, frameless installations for wall-oven make most efficient use of the available wall space in a kitchen.|$|R
50|$|The 21MX ran the HP RTE (Real Time) Operating System (OS). They {{started out}} as refrigerator-sized rack {{computers}} with lights and switches on the <b>front</b> <b>panels.</b> The last models would use a 1-chip processor and fit under a desk using a console terminal rather than a <b>front</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|R

50|$|For fun, bored programmers {{would create}} {{programs}} to display animated light shows. <b>Front</b> <b>panels</b> {{in the late}} 1960s and early 1970s were quite brightly colored. When bootstrap ROMs enabled computers to start themselves without operator intervention in the late 1970s and early 1980s, most computers were built without a <b>front</b> switch <b>panel.</b> High-powered calculators, such as the HP 9830 based on ROM, {{were among the first}} computers to do away with <b>front</b> <b>panels,</b> and operators.|$|R
