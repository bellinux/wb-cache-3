5|$|In 2004, a safe was {{discovered}} during excavations of a burial trench at the Hanford nuclear site. Inside the safe were various items, including a <b>large</b> <b>glass</b> bottle containing a whitish slurry which was subsequently {{identified as the}} oldest sample of weapons-grade plutonium known to exist. Isotope analysis by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory indicated that the plutonium in the bottle was manufactured in the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge during 1944.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Aronde, Simca marketed {{different}} trim {{levels of the}} Vedette under different model names, this time with references to the grand period of baroque in French history. The basic version was called the Simca Vedette Trianon, the mid-level was the Simca Vedette Versailles and, {{at the top of}} the range, the Simca Vedette Régence. An option on all versions was a <b>large</b> <b>glass</b> moonroof that slid into the roof, called Vistadome The Vedette range was still marketed under the Ford brand in some markets, including the Netherlands and Germany, until 1956. As the new model caught on, Simca was able to increase production from the 150daily achieved during Ford's ownership of the factory to 250cars a day.|$|E
5|$|In 1827, at its peak, {{the canal}} {{transport}}ed 332,000 tons. The {{main purpose of}} the canal was still to transport coal to Givors, from where it could be taken to other towns on the river Rhone. On the return trip, boats carried some of the merchandise of the Midi including iron, oak wood and other things needed by the factories of the Loire department. By 1831, the population of Givors had risen to 9,210. There were many factories making window panes, bottles and glasses, and the port had a busy trade in coal shipment. Ten <b>large</b> <b>glass</b> works had been established at Rive-de-Gier that also transported their products by the canal.|$|E

5|$|Narrated by Tseng, {{leader of}} the elite espionage and {{assassination}} division known as the Turks, Last Order switches between the Nibelheim incident and Zack Fair's escape to Midgar with his unconscious friend, Cloud Strife. During the Nibelheim event, Sephiroth, insane after discovering his origins, sets fire {{to the village of}} Nibelheim. After killing many villagers, he proceeds to the Nibelheim reactor where Jenova has been encased. Tifa, a resident of Nibelheim, attacks him soon after he arrives. Sephiroth knocks her aside and continues to Jenova's body, preserved in a <b>large</b> <b>glass</b> tank filled with liquid. Zack follows Sephiroth into the reactor and they engage in combat, but Sephiroth is able to disarm and incapacitate him. Sephiroth returns to Jenova's body, but does not notice Cloud approaching.|$|E
5|$|The {{roof was}} {{originally}} painted white to aesthetically {{distinguish it from}} both Safeco Field and the nearby industrial area. The {{east side of the}} stadium has a <b>large</b> <b>glass</b> curtain wall that faces the nearby International District. The exterior of the stadium also consists of salmon-colored concrete, and {{the west side of the}} structure is partially clad with red brick. The coloring and facade were designed so the stadium would blend with the older buildings in neighboring Pioneer Square. To reduce costs, the exterior was not completed with brick or ornate steel work.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's machine used a {{belt and}} pulley system that could be {{operated}} by one person turning a crank. A large pulley {{was attached to the}} crank-handle, and a much smaller pulley was attached to a <b>large</b> <b>glass</b> globe. An iron axle passed through the globe. This allowed the globe to be rotated at high speed. When the crank was turned, the glass globe rubbed against a leather pad, which generated a large static charge, similar to the electrical charge that could be created by rubbing a glass tube with wool cloth by hand. The machine was unique improvement over others made in Europe at the time, as the glass globe could be spun faster with much less labor. A few revolutions of the handle was all that was needed to charge a Leyden jar.|$|E

5|$|Much of the Cetacean Institute, Taylor's workplace, {{was created}} by using the real-life Monterey Bay Aquarium. A holding tank for the whales was added via special effects to the Aquarium's exterior. For close-ups of the {{characters}} as they watched the whales in the tank, the Aquarium's walls and railings were measured and replicated for a set on the Paramount parking lot. One scene takes place by a <b>large</b> <b>glass</b> through which observers view the whales—and Spock's initiation of a mind meld—underwater. Footage of the actors shot {{in front of them}} as they reacted to a brick wall in the Aquarium was combined with shots taken from their rear as they stood in front of a large blue screen at ILM to produce this scene. The footage of Spock's melding with the whales was shot weeks later in a large water tank used to train astronauts for weightlessness.|$|E
5|$|Acting on a {{tip from}} Strax, the Doctor visits the Great Intelligence Institute posing as Sherlock Holmes. He confronts Dr. Simeon and find a <b>large</b> <b>glass</b> globe in Simeon's office that {{contains}} psychic snow. The Doctor speaks to the Great Intelligence, the entity that has been speaking to Dr. Simeon {{since he was a}} boy. He learns that the Great Intelligence has been controlling the snowmen and has taken interest in Latimer's pond. The Doctor visits the pond and deduces that the Great Intelligence is using the old governess' body as a DNA blueprint to form an ice creature that will retain its form and not melt. While Clara is putting the children to bed, the frozen body of the governess breaks into the house. The Doctor fights her off and is joined by Vastra, Jenny and Strax. Dr. Simeon arrives with more snowmen and tells them he wants the governess' ice body. The Doctor flees with Clara to the roof of the mansion and then to the TARDIS hovering overhead. They are pursued by the ice governess, whom the Doctor traps under a layer of frozen ice crystals. Inside the TARDIS the Doctor gives Clara a TARDIS key, but the ice governess arrives and pulls Clara down off the cloud.|$|E

25|$|The same year, Duchamp also {{attended}} {{a performance of}} a stage adaptation of Raymond Roussel's 1910 novel, Impressions d'Afrique which featured plots that turned in on themselves, word play, surrealistic sets and humanoid machines. He credited the drama with having radically changed his approach to art, and having inspired him to begin the creation of his The Bride Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors, Even, also known as The <b>Large</b> <b>Glass.</b> Work on The <b>Large</b> <b>Glass</b> continued into 1913, with his invention of inventing a repertoire of forms. He made notes, sketches and painted studies, and even drew some of his ideas {{on the wall of}} his apartment.|$|E

25|$|Marcel Duchamp came to {{international}} {{prominence in the}} wake of the New York City Armory Show in 1913 where his Nude Descending a Staircase became the cause celebre. He subsequently created The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, <b>Large</b> <b>Glass.</b> The <b>Large</b> <b>Glass</b> pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp (who was soon to renounce artmaking for chess) became closely associated with the Dada movement that began in neutral Zürich, Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. Francis Picabia (see above), Man Ray, Kurt Schwitters, Tristan Tzara, Hans Richter, Jean Arp, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, along with Duchamp and many others are associated with the Dadaist movement. Duchamp and several Dadaists are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E
25|$|The Museum {{is housed}} in a renovated {{industrial}} building. A <b>large</b> <b>glass</b> elevator provides access to the upper floors of the museum. The elevator was once located outside the museum but is now inside due to the Museum's 2006-2007 expansion and renovation.

25|$|French {{doors are}} derived from an {{original}} French design called the casement door. It is a door with lites where all or some panels {{would be in a}} casement door. A French door traditionally has a moulded panel {{at the bottom of the}} door.

25|$|Chiefly a {{pastoral}} river in a largely undeveloped area of New Jersey, the Paulins Kill has remained generally unaffected by industrial pollution. Dams were erected to power various small-town gristmills, sawmills, oil expellers, and fulling mills, and the {{electrical power plant}} at Branchville established in 1903. Columbia, a hamlet {{near the mouth of}} the Paulins Kill in Knowlton Township, was known for a <b>large</b> <b>glass</b> manufacturing factory. In recent decades, the dams have been breached or no longer impede the flow of the river.|$|E
