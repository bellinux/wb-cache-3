5|$|Leading {{figures in}} the new Parliament {{included}} Lord Melville, a Rye House Plotter who joined William's court in 1683 and the Earl of Stair, {{a former member of}} James VII's administration. In 1689 Melville became Secretary of State over Scotland, with Stair appointed Lord Advocate. The first session ended in a stalemate between Crown and Parliament over the abolition of Episcopacy and the Committee of the Articles, an unelected body used by the Scottish Crown to control legislation. Parliament refused to approve taxes or accept nominations for <b>legal</b> <b>officers,</b> closing the law courts. William retaliated by withholding Royal Assent which prevented the implementation of Parliamentary legislation.|$|E
25|$|The {{subordinate}} judiciary in Singapore {{has come}} under more scrutiny than the superior judiciary. State Courts judges lack tenure, and the LSC determines the terms of their appointments. Thus, {{the substance of the}} criticisms is that the career advancement of the lower judiciary depends on the LSC, of which the Attorney-General is a member. Members of the subordinate judiciary can be transferred out of the courts to the Attorney-General's Chambers or to some other government department to serve as <b>legal</b> <b>officers.</b> Thus, there are worries of heavy legislative and executive influence over the appointment and removal of subordinate judges, and that they will be influenced by government ideology and policy in their role as judges.|$|E
25|$|The {{opening of}} each legal year is {{marked with a}} {{ceremony}} usually held on the first Saturday of January, though in 2011 it {{took place on the}} first Friday. In form it is a court hearing, though lawyers are not required to dress in court robes. During the ceremony, the Attorney-General and the President of the Law Society of Singapore deliver speeches. The Chief Justice then responds with his own speech, and also announces the names of advocates and solicitors appointed as Senior Counsel. The speeches generally summarize legal developments over the past year and look forward to the future, and the Attorney-General and Law Society President traditionally pledge that <b>legal</b> <b>officers</b> and legal practitioners will continue to support the judiciary and co-operate with each other.|$|E

25|$|Johnston {{appointed}} Charles Grimes, the Surveyor-General, as Judge-Advocate {{and ordered}} Macarthur {{and the six}} officers be tried; they were found not guilty. Macarthur was then appointed as Colonial Secretary and effectively ran the business affairs of the colony. Another prominent opponent of Bligh, Macarthur's ally Thomas Jamison, was made the colony's Naval Officer (the equivalent of Collector of Customs and Excise). Jamison was also reinstated as a magistrate, which enabled him and his fellow <b>legal</b> <b>officers</b> to scrutinise Bligh's personal papers for evidence of wrongdoing by the deposed governor. In June 1809 Jamison sailed to London to bolster his business interests and give evidence against Bligh in any legal prosecutions that might be brought against the mutineers. Jamison died in London {{at the beginning of}} 1811, however, so he did not have an opportunity to testify at Johnston's court martial, which was not conducted until June of that year (see below).|$|E
25|$|The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) was {{established}} in November 1994 by the United Nations Security Council with jurisdiction over the crimes committed during the Rwandan Genocide. For its first rape indictment, it took the ICTR three years to proceed. Two years after {{the establishment of the}} ICTR, a sexual assault unit of the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) was created with three <b>legal</b> <b>officers,</b> one psychologist, one nurse, two lawyers, two policewomen, and one policeman. Under the ICTR, the sexual assault unit of the (OTP) created a policy to specifically carry out the legal proceedings of rape, genital mutilation, and other gender-targeted crimes. The OTP also has a Rape and Sexual Violence Section. This section under the OTP is headed by a female lawyer-investigator, and the OTP use female investigators and trial lawyers {{to reach out to the}} victims of rape and sexual violence, who are mostly women. Before the OTP, it was difficult to prosecute crimes of sexual violence under international criminal law, and because of these aspects, the OTP is considered to have founded the legal developments in the prosecution of gender-targeted crimes in international law.|$|E
25|$|Tiwari {{was one of}} {{the first}} <b>legal</b> <b>officers</b> who {{specialized}} in public international law when the International Affairs Division of the Attorney-General's Chambers was established. He was part of the Singapore team to the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and helped to frame important provisions in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which Singapore acceded to on 17 November 1994. He also headed negotiations which culminated in the signing of a pact in 1994 delineating a new boundary between Malaysia and Singapore in the Straits of Johor. Tiwari was on Singapore's legal team in a case brought by Malaysia to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea for provisional measures against alleged damage to its territorial waters due to land reclamation by Singapore in Tuas. On 8 October 2003, the Tribunal declined to prescribe provisional measures, stating that Malaysia had not shown that there was a situation of urgency or any risk that its rights to its territorial sea would suffer irreversible damage pending consideration of the merits of the case. Having been involved in the territorial dispute between Singapore and Malaysia over Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge for almost 30 years, including leading bilateral negotiations to attempt a settlement and later to conclude the special agreement submitting the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), he was part of the team that presented Singapore's case before the ICJ in 2007. The following year, the Court ruled that Singapore had sovereignty over Pedra Branca. Tiwari was also legal adviser to the delegation which negotiated the agreement establishing diplomatic relations between Singapore and the People's Republic of China, and was a member of the Hindu Endowments Board (from 2 May 1983), the Hindu Advisory Board which advises the Government and the Hindu Endowments Board on matters relating to the Hindu religion and custom, and the board of the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore.|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time, Henry and his {{descendants}} normally followed {{the will of}} the courts, despite the fact they were theoretically not bound by judges. William Holdsworth infers that by regularly asking the <b>legal</b> <b>officers</b> of the crown and judiciary for legal advice and consent, Henry recognised the need for a stable government to follow the law. He also contends that the view that the law is supreme over all [...] "was the view of all the leading lawyers and statesmen and publicists of the Tudor period".

2500|$|The Chief Justice {{and other}} Supreme Court judges are {{appointed}} by the President acting {{on the advice of}} Cabinet. The President must consult the Chief Justice when appointing other judges, and may exercise personal discretion to refuse to make an appointment if he does not concur with the Cabinet's advice. Supreme Court justices enjoy security of tenure up to the age of 65 years, after which they cease to hold office. However, the Constitution permits such judges to be re-appointed on a term basis, as well as for judicial commissioners to be appointed for limited periods, including the hearing of single cases. Judicial officers of the State Courts are also appointed on a term basis by the Legal Service Commission (LSC), and can be transferred from the courts to other government departments to serve as <b>legal</b> <b>officers,</b> and [...] It has been claimed that this creates a risk of executive interference, although a 1986 inquiry into such allegations found no evidence of this.|$|E
2500|$|District {{judges and}} magistrates of the State Courts are {{appointed}} to their positions by the Legal Service Commission (LSC) on a term basis, {{and do not}} enjoy security of tenure. These judges can be transferred by the LSC from the courts to other government departments to serve as <b>legal</b> <b>officers,</b> and [...] This {{may be said to}} create a risk of executive interference. The transfer of Senior District Judge Michael Khoo is often cited as an illustration of this. Opposition Member of Parliament J.B. Jeyaretnam and a co-accused had each been charged with three charges of having fraudulently transferred cheques to prevent the distribution of money to the creditors of the Workers' Party of Singapore, and one charge of making a false declaration. In January 1981, Khoo acquitted the defendants of all charges except a single charge of fraud involving a cheque for S$400. He sentenced Jeyaretnam to a $1,000 fine, which was below the amount of $2,000 that would have caused him to lose his seat in Parliament. Upon the Public Prosecutor's appeal to the High Court, Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin ordered retrials on the two charges of cheque fraud that the defendants had been acquitted of. In August 1981, before the retrials, Khoo was transferred to the Attorney General's Chambers to take up appointment as a deputy public prosecutor. The defendants were convicted of the charges by a different senior district judge and sentenced to three months' imprisonment each. Jeyaretnam and his co-accused then appealed to the High Court, which confirmed their convictions but reduced the sentences to a fine of $5,000 each. However, a commission of inquiry convened in 1986 to examine Khoo's transfer determined that no evidence of executive interference in the State Courts had been presented, and that the transfer had been decided by the Chief Justice in consultation with the Attorney-General. It did not investigate why the transfer was made. In Parliamentary debates before and after the inquiry it was suggested on the one hand that the transfer had been routine and the timing coincidental, and on the other that it was related to Khoo's competence in handling the case. The reason for the transfer was never clearly established.|$|E

This was violently construed as treason, and a jury, threatened by the <b>legal</b> <b>officers</b> with secular, and by the preachers with future spiritual punishment, by a small majority condemned some of the ministers (January 1606).

He summoned (1606) the two Melvilles, Andrew and his nephew James, to London, where Andrew bullied in his own violent style, and was, quite illegally, first imprisoned and then banished to France.|$|E

60|$|And so Madame Goesler {{started for}} Prague with the {{determination}} of being back, if possible, before the trial began. It was to be commenced at the Old Bailey {{towards the end of}} June, and people already began to foretell that it would extend over a very long period. The circumstances seemed to be simple; but they who understood such matters declared that the duration of a trial depended a great deal more on the public interest felt in the matter than upon its own nature. Now it was already perceived that no trial of modern days had ever been so interesting as would be this trial. It was already known that the Attorney-General, Sir Gregory Grogram, was to lead the case for the prosecution, and that the Solicitor-General, Sir Simon Slope, was to act with him. It had been thought to be due to the memory and character of Mr. Bonteen, who when he was murdered had held the office of President of the Board of Trade, and who had very nearly been Chancellor of the Exchequer, that so unusual a task should be imposed on these two high <b>legal</b> <b>officers</b> of the Government. No doubt there would be a crowd of juniors with them, but it was understood that Sir Gregory Grogram would himself take the burden of the task upon his own shoulders. It was declared everywhere that Sir Gregory did believe Phineas Finn to be guilty, but it was also declared that Sir Simon Slope was convinced he was innocent. The defence was to be entrusted to the well-practised but now aged hands of that most experienced practitioner Mr. Chaffanbrass, than whom no barrister living or dead ever rescued more culprits from the fangs of the law. With Mr. Chaffanbrass, who quite late in life had consented to take a silk gown, was to be associated Mr. Serjeant Birdbolt,--who was said to be employed in order that the case might be in safe hands should the strength of Mr. Chaffanbrass fail him at the last moment; and Mr. Snow, who was supposed to handle a witness more judiciously than any of the rising men, and that subtle, courageous, eloquent, and painstaking youth, Mr. Golightly, who now, with no more than ten or fifteen years' practice, was already known to be earning his bread and supporting a wife and family.|$|E
