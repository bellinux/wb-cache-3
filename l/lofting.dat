5|$|The {{day after}} the Test, the Australians moved onto their next match against Derbyshire, where Miller scored 57 and took 3/31 in the first innings but bowled only two overs as Australia won by an innings. In a rain-affected draw against Glamorgan, Miller took 2/41 in the hosts' first innings of 197 before {{compiling}} a hard-hitting 84. Coming in to join Hassett with the score at 2/67, he struck five sixes and seven fours. He hit one of the sixes with one hand, sending it 20 rows into the crowd. Miller also attacked the Glamorgan captain Wilf Wooller, hitting him over the sightscreen with straight drives from consecutive balls and <b>lofting</b> a third six over long off. He was finally dismissed while attempting another six; Australia's first innings was washed out at 3/215.|$|E
5|$|During Englandâ€™s second innings, Joe Hardstaff, Jr. {{fell for}} 43, <b>lofting</b> Ernie Toshack to Hassett {{on the leg}} side to end a {{partnership}} of 93 with Denis Compton. The ball looped {{up in the air}} and travelled half-way to the square leg boundary, but Hassett managed to keep track of its trajectory through the fog. Australia eventually finished off the hosts for 441, leaving them a target of 98 on the final afternoon. Australia proceeded steadily to 38 from 32 minutes before Morris fell. Bradman came in and was out for a duck. This left Australia at 2/48, at which point dark clouds began to close in on the ground, and it appeared that rain might save England. However, it never came, and meanwhile Hassett joined Barnes. The pair attacked, Hassett twice driving Bedser over the infield for boundaries, and later pulling another ball in the air for another four. The tourists reached the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting. Barnes tied the scores with a swept boundary, but ran off the field with a souvenir stump, believing that the match was over. He returned to the field when he noticed the crowd reaction; Hassett hit the winning run to end with an unbeaten 21.|$|E

5|$|Soon after, Compton edged to the slips {{from the}} bowling of Miller, but Johnson spilled the catch. Hardstaff fell for 43, <b>lofting</b> Toshack to Hassett {{on the leg}} side, having put on 93 with Compton. The ball looped {{up in the air}} and {{travelled}} half-way to the square leg boundary, but Hassett managed to keep track of its trajectory through the fog. Barnett came in and together with Compton added 21 runs in 33 minutes before edging Johnston to Miller, who completed a difficult catch in slips. Yardley came out to bat at 264/5 and Compton drove Miller square for four, provoking the bowler's first bouncer of the day. Compton hooked it away for two and Miller's next delivery slipped out of his hand and cleared Compton's head on the full to some jeering in the crowd. Such a ball is known as a beamer and is illegal because of the physical danger it poses to the batsman. Compton and Yardley put on a 57-run partnership in 66 minutes before Johnston held a return catch to dismiss Yardley for 22. England reached stumps at 345/6, just one run ahead of Australia, with Compton on 154 and Evans on 10. During the day, Johnston bowled the most overs, 30.|$|E
5|$|After the interval, Bradman {{continued}} with his strategy of rotating his bowlers in short spells, {{and set a}} defensive, well-spread field for Johnson's bowling. Edrich hit three consecutive boundaries from Johnson before <b>lofting</b> a fourth ball into the crowd for six. He then passed his half-centuryhis fourth consecutive Test score in excess of 50before Lindwall trapped him lbw for 51 to leave England at 232/3, ending a third-wicket partnership of 103. Crapp came in and added 18 before he was bowled by Lindwall, inside edging an attempted forcing stroke through the off side from the back foot. This left England at 260/4, and precipitated a mini-collapse. Yardley deliberately lifted Lindwall over the vacant slips region and reached seven before he fell to Johnston, caught by a leaping Harvey while attempting a lofted shot. Johnston then had Cranston caught behind for a duck with only a further run added to leave England at 278/6, a lead of 316. Evans came in and edged his first ball through the slips at a catchable height for four. Compton drove Lindwall for a boundary but then fell to Johnston for 66, caught by Miller at cover. England were 293/7 with no recognised batsmen remaining, having lost 4/33. Wicket-keeper Evans was joined by Bedser, and the pair added 37 before Miller removed the latter. Laker came in and helped Evans to add a further 32 as England reached 362/8 {{at the close of}} the fourth day. Evansmainly through boundarieshad helped England to add 69 runs in the last 45 minutes of play.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} afternoon, Johnson {{came to the}} crease at 5/294 in Australia's first innings when Harvey {{departed}} for 112, but he made only 10 before falling at 6/329. Lindwall replaced him and made 77 as Australia's tail pushed the score to 458 on the fourth morning, reducing the deficit to 38. In the second innings, the English batsmen continued to attack Johnson. Given Johnson's lack of economy in the first innings, Bradman declined to use him for {{the entirety of the}} first session of the fourth day. When Johnson was introduced after lunch, he was targeted, and Washbrook and Hutton both lofted him for sixes in quick succession, prompting Bradman to remove him from the attack. When Johnson returned, Hutton again hit him in the air, but this time Bradman took a running catch to dismiss the batsman for 57, leaving England at 2/129. Edrich and Compton came in and were initially pinned down, but after 45 minutes, Compton charged Johnson and heaved a delivery to the leg side for a boundary. Bradman promptly took the new ball as England reached 2/209 at tea. After the break, England continued to target Johnson. Edrich hit Johnson for three consecutive fours before <b>lofting</b> a fourth into the crowd for six. Compton took risks against Johnson, successfully cutting against the spin several times, and Bradman was forced to use a well-spread field to cut down the fast scoring off Johnson. England reached 2/232 before collapsing to be 8/362 {{at the end of the}} day, but Johnson was not responsible for any of these wickets.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Loft</b> Law Amendment (also {{referred}} to as Expanded <b>Loft</b> Law) is a New York law that created a new window period for recognition of <b>loft</b> tenants that previously did not qualify under the original 1982 <b>Loft</b> Law.|$|R
40|$|In {{a series}} of {{experiments}} which involved only short distance experimental releases (800 m or less and within view of the home <b>loft),</b> it was demonstrated that dorsomedial forebrain ablated pigeons generally failed to reassociate with their home <b>loft</b> if the postablation experimental release took place soon postablation or if during the time between ablation and experimental release they were kept away from their home <b>loft.</b> In contrast, if dorsomedial forebrain ablated pigeons were allowed to recover at their home <b>loft</b> prior to experimental release, they succeeded in associating with their home <b>loft</b> {{in a manner similar}} to controls. However, only postablation exposure to a pigeon's own <b>loft</b> was sufficient to permit continued home <b>loft</b> association. Pigeons from one <b>loft</b> failed to associate with a foreign postablation recovery <b>loft</b> when released within sight of it. The results show that dorsomedial forebrain ablations result in pigeons which no longer succeed in associating with their home loft; recovery from failed home <b>loft</b> association behavior is possible with postablation exposure to the home <b>loft,</b> and a pigeon's previous association with a <b>loft</b> was a precondition if postablation association was to be affected. The results suggest that dorsomedial forebrain ablated pigeons retain something like a 'home <b>loft</b> trace' which they can use to mediate retrieval and reformation of the recognition properties needed for proper home <b>loft</b> association...|$|R
5000|$|The typical <b>loft</b> for woods {{ranges from}} 7.5 to 31 degrees.

25|$|A flick shot is a straight-batted shot {{played on}} the leg side by {{flicking}} a full-length delivery using the wrists. It is often also called the clip off the legs. The shot is playing with the bat coming through straight as for the on drive, but the bat face is angled towards the leg side. It can be played both off the front foot or the back foot, either off the toes or from the hips. The shot is played between the mid on and square leg region. Typically played along the ground, the flick can also be played by <b>lofting</b> the ball over the infield.|$|E
25|$|Glamorgan Dragons' bowler David Harrison bowled {{a fierce}} spell which only conceded 17 runs in nine overs - {{including}} five runs to extras - as Glamorgan limited the hosts Northamptonshire Steelbacks to 201 all out at Sophia Gardens.

However, his 54-run partnership with Johann Louw gave Northamptonshire some hope of posing a challenge. Wickets fell with reasonable regularity, but captain Robert Croft refused to be dismissed, and his 81 not out anchored the chase.

There was good understanding between the two, as {{they were involved in}} a number of vital partnerships down the order for Bangladesh. Aminul Islam went for 55, but Moni carried on ruthlessly demolishing the opposition bowling. Bangladesh eventually reached 302, thanks mainly to 131 by Moni. Aided by the tail enders, he went after the WB bowling. He was especially harsh on the slow bowlers, <b>lofting</b> them for a number of sixes. As the national stadium crowd were basking in afternoon sunshine (it was early spring), they also enjoyed batting of the highest class.|$|E

25|$|Barbary corsairs are protagonists in Le pantere di Algeri (the panthers of Algiers) by Emilio Salgari.

25|$|When {{the ball}} was bowled along the ground, the batsman used his curved bat to attack {{it and try to}} hit it away, usually with the {{intention}} of <b>lofting</b> it over the fielders. There was, as such, no defensive technique other than the most rudimentary and instinctive attempt to stop a ball that had deceived him. The pitched delivery made the curved bat obsolete and the straight bat lent itself to the deployment of a defensive stroke. As the aim of the batsman with a curved bat was to hit the ball over the fielders, low scores were normal. If he did not time his shot correctly, the chances were high that he would miss the ball and be bowled or stumped; or else if he hit it poorly, he would not clear the fielder and be caught out. In addition, the pitches of the time were little more than rough tracks which were to the bowler's advantage. One of the greatest players of the pioneering period was Richard Newland of Slindon and Sussex. In July 1745, he scored 88 for All-England against Kent at the Artillery Ground. It is not absolutely certain that he did this in one innings as it may have been his match total (there is a parallel here with Small in a 1768 match). If it was one innings, it is the highest individual score recorded during the pioneering period and, for its time, was a very high score which could equate in real terms to a modern triple-century.|$|E
25|$|The day {{started with}} Tendulkar and Ganguly in an {{aggressive}} mood with both batsmen lifting Brad Hogg for sixes and scoring many boundaries. Ganguly was particularly successful, reaching 67 from 78 balls before <b>lofting</b> Hogg to mid-off {{against the run}} of play. Tendulkar was fortunate to survive a close LBW call. When Yuvraj replaced Ganguly at the crease, India's momentum slowed as he had difficulties dealing with the second new ball, before being trapped LBW. The lunch break came soon after, and Dhoni was quickly removed by Lee as was Kumble shortly after the resumption, leaving India seven wickets down {{and more than a}} hundred runs behind. Harbhajan joined Tendulkar and scored quickly to begin with, from a series of risky shots. He then settled down and began batting in a more orthodox manner, providing steady support to Tendulkar. Harbhajan and Tendulkar passed their half-century and century respectively after the tea break, as the eighth wicket partnership passed 100. It was after Harbhajan passed 50 that his altercation with Symonds occurred, leading umpire Benson to speak to Harbhajan. Harbhajan was then dismissed and India surpassed Australia's total. Singh and Sharma then scored 13 and 23 respectively before India were bowled out. Tendulkar finished with 154 not out and raised some eyebrows for continually taking the single from the first ball of the over and handing the strike to Singh and Sharma, the latter of whom had previously only scored 17 runs at Test level. India had a 68-run lead. Hayden and Jaques were unbeaten at stumps, having survived five overs.|$|E

25|$|That was not all, however. The chase began very sedately, only Tushar Imran {{looking to}} take runs as he smashed Brad Hogg about, but Hogg got his revenge when Tushar was out for 24, <b>lofting</b> to Katich. Earlier, Nafees Iqbal had gone for 8, and with Javed Omar {{out as the}} third man to fall, for 19 off 51 balls, it looked to be {{business}} as usual for Bangladesh. But this match had more tricks up its sleeve. Hogg and Clarke leaked runs like a drain, six wides were bowled, and Mohammad Ashraful showed another glimpse of why he's been called Bangladesh's finest batsman. As he made the second ODI hundred in the Bangladesh team's history, he forged a massive 130-run partnership with Habibul Bashar, and had a great two hours at the crease (although dropped on 54) â€“ before picking out Jason Gillespie at long on to be out for exactly 100. Bangladesh still needed 23 runs off 17 balls, but Aftab Ahmed continued his fine form from the Oval match with England, as he first took a leg bye off Ashraful, then gave the strike to Rafique, who smashed a cover driven four before taking another leg bye. A four and a dot-ball finished a 10-run over, meaning that Bangladesh now needed only 13 off 12 balls. A good over from McGrath followed, as he conceded only six runs â€“ including an edged four from Rafique. With the last over, Bangladesh needed seven runs, and Ahmed swung the first ball of the over to midwicket for six. Thus, it became a formality â€“ Bangladesh won with four balls and five wickets to spare, almost convincing in today's cricket, and the result meant that the Aussies needed a victory over England at Bristol the following day to have any chance of winning the group stage.|$|E
500|$|According to Bradman, Morris' {{success was}} due to his {{powerful}} wrists and forearms. Bradman interpreted Morris' unorthodox methodsâ€”he often defended with his bat not straightâ€”as a sign of genius. Ian Johnson believed that Morris' idiosyncratic technique was a strength, as it disrupted any plans made by the opposition. Contrary to the accepted wisdom of the day, Morris had a penchant for <b>lofting</b> his drives, backing his ability to clear the infield. Benaud rated Morris alongside Neil Harvey as having the best footwork against spin bowling among batsmen after the Second World War. Morris was particularly known for his fast analysis {{of the length of}} the ball, and as a result, he quickly and decisively moved forward or back. Morris' productivity declined {{in the latter half of}} his career, something he put down to the break-up of his opening pairing with Barnes. Morris' partnerships with his later partners yielded less runs, leading him to remark that [...] "When Siddy [...] went, I lost a lot of support because he'd always get ones." [...] Morris was also known for his unselfishness, often sacrificing his wicket after being involved in mix-ups while running between wickets, and he had a reputation for not attempting to finish not out to inflate his average.|$|E
500|$|After being rested against Surrey, the {{following}} match was against Gloucestershire at Bristol, where in only five hours, Morris scored his career best of 290. Having lost the opening two {{games of the}} series, England were contemplating changes to their team: Tom Goddard was tipped to replace Jim Laker as the off spinner, having been in prolific form in county cricket. The English hoped {{that he would be}} the weapon to cut through Australia's strong batting line-up. Morris' assault ended Goddard's hopes of Test selection. His innings was highlighted by his quick assessment of the pitch of the ball, followed by decisive footwork. Morris confidently went out of his crease when the ball was of a full length and rocked onto the back foot to drive and cut if it was short. On many occasions, he hit Goddard on the full. Unable to contain Morris, Goddard packed the leg side field and bowled outside leg stump. Morris stepped down the wicket, repeatedly <b>lofting</b> the ball over the off side. Morris reached his century by lunch and was 231 by the tea interval. By the time he was dismissed, he had struck 40 fours and a six. Fingleton said that [...] "Morris flayed it [...] in all directions", while former English Test paceman Maurice Tate said [...] "Tom [...] is not used to batsmen using their feet to him ... the county batsmen diddle and diddle [...] to him and that gets him many wickets." [...] Australia promptly crushed the locals by an innings.|$|E
