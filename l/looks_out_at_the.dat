His 1814 Portrait of Madame de Senonnes {{was described as}} [...] "to the feminine what the Louvre's Bertin is to the masculine". The sitter for his 1848 Portrait of Baronne de Rothschild <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> viewer with the same directness as Bertin, but is softened by her attractive dress and relaxed pose; she is engaging and sympathetic rather than tough and imposing.|$|E
500|$|Blood Omen 2 pursues {{a younger}} Kain during his early conquests of Nosgoth, in the altered {{timeline}} {{triggered by the}} changes to Raziel's destiny {{at the end of}} Soul Reaver 2. Legacy of Kain: Defiance takes place in the same altered timeline, periodically switching between the characters of the elder Kain and Raziel from Soul Reaver 2, with both acting as playable protagonists. Over the course of the game, Moebius manipulates Kain into believing he is a champion prophesied to fight against and destroy Raziel, culminating in a final battle between the two characters which Raziel wins. It is discovered that The Elder God is malevolent, and he and Moebius—his servant—had conspired against Kain from the outset of the series, considering vampires an abomination. Kain, after being presumed dead, returns, and reconciles with Raziel, who willingly enters the Soul Reaver. As he does so, he uses his powers to cleanse Kain of the corruption he inherited at birth as a Pillar guardian. Armed with the ancient sword once again, Kain is able to see and battle The Elder God for the first time, but is unable to destroy him. The story ends as he <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Nosgoth landscape; though uncertain that he can ever restore the world, he contemplates Raziel's sacrifice and the [...] "first bitter taste" [...] of hope it has given him.|$|E
60|$|He {{is not a}} man much {{addicted}} to sentiment or speculation, but sometimes when his day's work is done, and he strays to his garden gate and <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dim and peaceful English landscape beyond, and thence to the wide star-strewn heavens above, he wonders if the hour will ever come when once more he will see those dark and passionate eyes, and hear that sweet remembered voice.|$|E

60|$|Hodson {{goes to the}} house. When {{he opens}} the door he finds Nora and Aunt Judy on the threshold.

Nora goes {{to the back of the}} rustic seat and <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> gate with the air of a woman accustomed to have nothing to do. Larry returns from the shrubbery.|$|E
60|$|I don't know as {{it would}} be proper for me to mention the grown-up people over the way. They go on very much as the {{children}} do; for there is the lazy, dandified man, who gets up late, and drinks; the cross man, who swears at the shed-door when it won't shut; the fatherly man, who sits among his children every evening, and the cheery old man up in the attic, who has a flower in his window, and <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> world with very much the same serene smile as my orange-coloured baby.|$|E

When I {{get there in}} the morning, there she is sitting up in bed, for my lady don't care to get up; and then she makes me bring this book and that book, till the bed is heaped up with immense volumes that half bury her, making her look, as she leans upon her elbow, like the stoning of Stephen. She yawns; then she looks towards the tall glass; then she <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> weather, mooning her great black eyes, and fixing them on the sky as if they stuck there, while my tongue goes flick-flack along, {{a hundred and fifty}} words a minute; then she looks at the clock; then she asks me what I've been reading.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Improve the rheumatism! Heaven forbid! {{that would}} be worse than adding colours to the violet. No, I mean to {{recommend}} {{a night on the}} couch of the nose of Scotland, merely to improve the imagination. Who knows what dreams might be produced by a night spent in a mansion of so many memories! For aught I know, the iron door of the postern stair might open at the dead hour of midnight, and, as {{at the time of the}} conspiracy, forth might sally the phantom assassins, with stealthy step and ghastly look, to renew the semblance of the deed. There comes the fierce fanatic Ruthven, party hatred enabling him to bear the armour which would otherwise weigh down a form extenuated by wasting disease. See how his writhen features show under the hollow helmet, like those of a corpse tenanted by a demon, whose vindictive purpose <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> flashing eyes, while the visage has the stillness of death. Yonder appears the tall form of the boy Darnley, as goodly in person as vacillating in resolution; yonder he advances with hesitating step, and yet more hesitating purpose, his childish fear having already overcome his childish passion. He is in the plight of a mischievous lad who has fired a mine, and who now, expecting the explosion in remorse and terror, would give his life to quench the train which his own hand lighted. Yonder--yonder--But I forget the rest of the worthy cutthroats. Help me if you can." ...|$|E
