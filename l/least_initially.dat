5|$|Miss Ophelia – Augustine St. Clare's pious, hard-working, {{abolitionist}} cousin from Vermont. She {{displays the}} ambiguities towards African-Americans felt by many Northerners at the time. She argues against {{the institution of}} slavery yet, at <b>least</b> <b>initially,</b> feels repulsed by the slaves as individuals.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} number of non-Jewish Poles also did not trust the Germans and decided not to leave the city. Many wounded Home Army soldiers became stranded during the uprising and were simply not able to evacuate in time. For others, the choice to remain resulted from feelings of despair and hopelessness brought {{by the fall of}} the uprising; at <b>least</b> <b>initially,</b> they simply did not have the motivation to leave.|$|E
5|$|Alexander's most {{immediate}} legacy was {{the introduction of}} Macedonian rule to huge new swathes of Asia. At {{the time of his}} death, Alexander's empire covered some , and was the largest state of its time. Many of these areas remained in Macedonian hands or under Greek influence for the next 200–300years. The successor states that emerged were, at <b>least</b> <b>initially,</b> dominant forces, and these 300years are {{often referred to as the}} Hellenistic period.|$|E
2500|$|The engines for Joseph Kellogg {{came from}} the older steamer Dayton. [...] Dayton had been built at Canemah, Oregon in 1868. [...] The boiler was wood-fired, at <b>least</b> as <b>initially</b> constructed.|$|R
2500|$|In Britain, {{the most}} {{important}} stars to popularize coon songs were Eugene Stratton, G. H. Elliott and G. H. Chirgwin. [...] "Coon imitators" [...] singing these songs were a staple part of British music-hall until at <b>least</b> 1920. <b>Initially</b> reserved to male artists; however, {{a small number of}} women and children increasingly began to sing coon songs {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century.|$|R

5|$|At <b>least</b> <b>initially,</b> {{some parts}} of the castle were occupied, {{possibly}} including the remains of the original manor house. The castle continued to be owned by the Hastings family until around 1630, when it was purchased by Sir Robert Banaster, and then by William Wollaston. Over the course {{of the rest of the}} century, Kirby Muxloe Castle was abandoned; it was robbed for its building materials, and became used for agricultural purposes.|$|E
5|$|After {{ten weeks}} being {{constantly}} watched to prevent suicide attempts in police custody, he {{was transferred to}} Akershus Fortress and awaited trial {{as part of the}} legal purge. Despite initially losing weight and suffering from polyneuritis, his strong constitution meant that he soon started working hard on his case with Henrik Bergh, a lawyer with a good track record but largely unsympathetic, at <b>least</b> <b>initially,</b> to Quisling's plight. Bergh did, however, believe Quisling's testimony that he tried to act {{in the best interests of}} Norway and decided to use this as a starting point for the defence.|$|E
5|$|As for King Leopold II's {{original}} {{designs for}} turning the expedition into a campaign into Sudan, the mutiny of Baron Dhanis' column had severely reduced the expedition's fighting power and {{made such a}} campaign impossible. Instead, Leopold's conquest of the Lado Enclave pleased the British government, at <b>least</b> <b>initially,</b> which welcomed any aid in their ongoing war with Mahdist Sudan. But frequent raids outside of Lado territory by Belgian forces based in Rejaf caused alarm and suspicion among British and French officials wary of Leopold's imperial ambitions. In 1910, {{following the death of}} the Belgian King in December 1909, British authorities reclaimed the Lado Enclave as per the Anglo-Congolese treaty signed in 1894, and added the territory to Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.|$|E
5000|$|Intel and {{industry}} partners are still developing optical Thunderbolt hardware and cables. The optical fiber cables are to run [...] "tens of meters" [...] {{but will not}} supply power, at <b>least</b> not <b>initially.</b> The version from Corning contains four 80/125 µm VSDN fibers to transport an infrared signal up to 100 m. The conversion of electrical signal to optical will be embedded into the cable itself, allowing the current MDP connector to be forward compatible, but eventually Intel hopes for a purely optical transceiver assembly embedded in the PC.|$|R
5000|$|A close {{relationship}} {{is thought to}} exist between these recesses and Chthonie.Hesiod described Tartaros as being [...] "in a recess (muchos) of broad-wayed earth". Hermann S.

50|$|It {{has become}} a {{widespread}} belief {{in recent years that}} these attacks are carried out deliberately by people, and generally sexually motivated. Animal welfare officers have also drawn links between attacks on horses and 'fertility cults'. At <b>least</b> one case <b>initially</b> believed to be horse-ripping was later shown to have been caused by another horse.|$|R
5|$|Britain's {{enemies in}} {{continental}} Europe had long recognised Ireland as a weak point in Britain's defences. Landing troops {{there was a}} popular strategic goal, not only because an invader could expect {{the support of a}} large proportion of the native population, but also because at <b>least</b> <b>initially</b> they would face fewer and less reliable troops than elsewhere in the British Isles. Additionally, embroiling the British Army in a protracted Irish campaign would reduce its availability for other theatres of war. Finally, French planners considered that a successful invasion of Ireland might act as the ideal platform for a subsequent invasion of Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{increases}} of the 1630s corresponded with {{a lull in}} the Thirty Years' War. In 1634/5 the German and Swedish armies lost ground in the South of Germany; then Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria moved north. After the Peace of Prague (1635) the French (and the Dutch) decided to support the Swedish and German protestants with money and arms against the Habsburg empire, and to occupy the Spanish Netherlands in 1636. Hence market prices (at <b>least</b> <b>initially)</b> were responding rationally to a rise in demand. However, the fall in prices was faster and more dramatic than the rise. Data on sales largely disappeared after the February 1637 collapse in prices, but a few other data points on bulb prices after tulip mania show that bulbs continued to lose value for decades thereafter.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00 the {{security}} situation at the Air America compound was deteriorating as General Carey {{did not wish to}} risk his Marines by extending his perimeter to cover the Air America compound (LZ 40), so all Air America helicopters from this time operated out of the tennis courts in the DAO Annex (LZ 35). This move created fuel problems for Air America as they no longer had access to the fuel supplies in their compound and at <b>least</b> <b>initially</b> they were refused fuel by the ships of TF76. According to US Naval Archives, at 12:30 an Air America Bell 205 landed Air Vice Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, Madame Kỳ, Dorothy Martin (wife of Ambassador Martin) and others on the USS Denver; contemporary reports state and photos show that Marshal Kỳ piloted his own UH-1H Huey to the USS Midway.|$|E
50|$|The priory {{buildings}} {{stood in}} a rectangular enclosure, with boundary ditches on at <b>least</b> three sides. <b>Initially</b> there were two wooden domestic buildings, adjoining a stone church, which later became the chancel as the nave was extended westwards from it. The wooden buildings were rebuilt in stone within a few decades and then partially rebuilt again a century later.|$|R
50|$|The chapel pre-dated {{the first}} Anglican church at Cleveland by at <b>least</b> six years. <b>Initially</b> {{services}} were conducted either by lay persons of by clergy from St Marys Church of England parish. As well, the building {{served as a}} school {{for the children of}} employees on Hope's estate, until establishment of the Cleveland No.2 School (Ormiston State School) in 1872.|$|R
5000|$|In Spain, {{the series}} was aired by the {{regional}} channels under the FORTA umbrella. The series did not arrive in Spain until at <b>least</b> 1992, and <b>initially</b> was only aired in various regions, normally in a weekday afternoon slot accompanying Dallas which also arrived late in Spain. Neither series completed their run in Spain and neither have been rescreened there in full or in part.|$|R
5|$|Monteverdi was, at <b>least</b> <b>initially,</b> much {{taken with}} the {{potential}} of the plot, and the opportunities the libretto provided for a variety of musical effects. Monteverdi stressed to Striggio the importance of finding a singer with real acting ability {{to play the role of}} Licori, someone capable of playing a man and a woman with appropriate emotions and gestures. Later he enthused about the chance to write a ballet for each of the five acts, all in different styles. Monteverdi's letters continued throughout the summer, but his attitude slowly changed, from one of evident commitment to frustration at the delays in getting the libretto copied. The musicologist Gary Tomlinson, in his analysis of the opera's genesis, suggests that Monteverdi may have been stalling. In September Striggio, having received, read and presumably not liked the expanded libretto, abruptly cancelled the commission and the work is heard of no more. Monteverdi was told instead to work on the Armida setting.|$|E
5|$|Orélie-Antoine {{felt that}} the {{indigenous}} peoples {{would be better served}} in negotiations with the surrounding powers by a European leader, and was accordingly elected by a group of Mapuche loncos (chieftains) to be their king. He made efforts to gain international recognition, and attempted to involve the French government in his project, but these efforts proved unsuccessful: the French consul concluded that Tounens was insane, and Araucania and Patagonia was never recognized by any country. The Chileans primarily ignored Orélie-Antoine and his kingdom, at <b>least</b> <b>initially,</b> and simply went on with the occupation of the Araucanía, a historical process which concluded in 1883 with Chile establishing control over the region. In the process, Orélie-Antoine was captured in 1862, and imprisoned in an insane asylum in Chile. After several fruitless attempts to return to his kingdom (thwarted by Chilean and Argentine authorities), Tounens died penniless in 1878 in Tourtoirac, France. The current pretender, Prince Antoine IV, lives in France. The previous pretender renounced his claims to the Patagonian throne, even though a few Mapuches continue to recognise the Araucanian monarchy.|$|E
5|$|These initial concerns, however, {{were short}} lived, {{at least in}} the {{beginning}} as the British government provided assurances that it would underwrite a large amount of the war risk insurance for shipping in order to allow trade amongst the Commonwealth to continue. Shortly thereafter the wartime direction of trade began when the British asked the Australian government to place certain restrictions upon overseas trade in order to secure resources vital to the war effort and to limit the ability of the Central Powers from obtaining these goods from Commonwealth nations via neutral third parties. To an extent these restrictions served to reduce the ability of Australian producers to find buyers for their products, at <b>least</b> <b>initially,</b> however, in many cases the British stepped in to buy these goods, thus alleviating Australian concerns about a significant reduction in the standard of living. This understanding proved particularly beneficial for the wool and wheat industries, where the British government undertook to buy Australian products even though the shortage of shipping meant that there was no chance that they would ever receive them.|$|E
50|$|Construction of the tail-less Mü9 {{was almost}} {{complete}} when further work was abandoned {{due to the}} negative experiences of contemporary tail-less aircraft builders and the far from satisfactory Akaflieg München Mü5 Wastl. The sharply tapered wing was to have had moderate sweep {{on the leading edge}} and zero sweep on the trailing edge with small vertical surfaces at the wing-tips. The fuselage pod was to support the engine in the nose, house the cabin amidships and the tailwheel at the extreme rear, with no fin or rudder, (at <b>least</b> as <b>initially</b> designed), as well as the mountings for the main undercarriage legs which were to have been angled outwards to provide adequate track.|$|R
40|$|Cold {{agglutinin}} disease (CAD) is an autoimmune {{hemolytic anemia}} (AIHA) generally caused by IgM autoantibodies which exhibit maximal reactivity at 4 °C.

50|$|Introducing heat {{into the}} working chamber {{can be done}} in a variety of ways. For most autoclaves, and {{particularly}} those used to process composite parts or perform adhesive bonding of metal structures, the easiest and <b>least</b> costly <b>initially</b> is electric heat. Resistance heaters are compact and reliable and can be placed conveniently in the circulating air duct. Since the thermal mass of these heaters is small, control of chamber temperature is precise and additional heaters can usually be installed at a later date without excessive bother. However, the cost of this additional installation may be quite significant in comparison with a larger autoclave. These heaters are essentially 100% efficient and can be fitted for any voltage, single or three phase.|$|R

50|$|It {{appears that}} Gruber did {{not object to}} Sousa's use of the song, at <b>least</b> not <b>initially,</b> and that Sousa passed on his {{royalties}} to Gruber. However, other sources state that Gruber became involved in a prolonged legal battle to recover {{the rights to the}} music he had written and that had been lifted (unknowingly or not) by Sousa and widely sold by sheet music publishers who reaped profits while Gruber received nothing. The music became so popular that it was also used in radio ads by firms such as the Hoover Vacuum Company. Gruber's position was rejected by the courts, which ruled that he had waited too long to complain and that his music was by that time in the public domain.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical {{analysis of the}} vibration response of a rotating rigid shaft supported by two radial deep-groove lubricated ball bearings. The bearings and their oilfilms are approximated {{to a set of}} non-linear elastic springs and dampers rotating relative to the shaft when it is subjected to a rotating unbalance or inner race surface waviness. Under gravity load, the shaft’s initial vibration is damped down to a limit cycle operating at a quasi-simple harmonic frequency of small amplitude.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{question}} of whether short periods of medication-free research in early episode schizophrenia result in demonstrable long-term harm to human subjects. A meta-analysis of published quasi-experimental and random assignment studies that had a majority of first- or second-episode schizophrenia spectrum subjects, at <b>least</b> 1 <b>initially</b> unmedicated group, and a minimum of 1 -year results was conducted. Only 6 studies, with 623 subjects, met inclusion criteria. The initially unmedicated groups showed a small, statistically nonsignificant long-term advantage (r = − 0. 09). Incorporating only random assignment studies into a composite effect size produced a similar near-zero result (r = 0. 01). Good-quality evidence is inadequate to support a conclusion of long-term harm resulting from short-term postponement of medication in early episode schizophrenia research. A categorical prohibition against such research should be reconsidered...|$|R
25|$|Results {{derived from}} {{analysis}} of the non-recombining portion of the Y- chromosomes (NRY) produced, at <b>least</b> <b>initially,</b> similar gradients to the classic demic diffusion hypothesis. Two significant studies were Semino 2000 and Rosser 2000, which identified haplogroups J2 and E1b1b (formerly E3b) as the putative genetic signatures of migrating Neolithic farmers from Anatolia, and therefore represent the Y-chromosomal components of a Neolithic demic diffusion.|$|E
25|$|Family {{tradition}} {{among some}} of Campbell's descendants indicates that she was, at <b>least</b> <b>initially,</b> unhappy at being separated from the Lenape. Although {{it is estimated that}} approximately half of the captives turned over to Bouquet attempted to return to their Native captors, a development which reportedly puzzled both the army and the communities to which the captives were being returned, it is not known whether Campbell was one of them.|$|E
25|$|Fecal bacteriotherapy, {{also known}} as a stool transplant, is {{approximately}} 85% to 90% effective in those for whom antibiotics have not worked. It involves infusion of bacterial flora acquired from the feces of a healthy donor to reverse the bacterial imbalance responsible for the recurring nature of the infection. The procedure replaces normal, healthy colonic flora that had been wiped out by antibiotics, and re-establishes resistance to colonization by Clostridium difficile. Side effects, at <b>least</b> <b>initially,</b> are few.|$|E

50|$|Because of {{the nominal}} 3.2 V output, four cells {{can be placed}} in series for a nominal voltage of 12.8 V. This comes close to the nominal voltage of six-cell {{lead-acid}} batteries. And, along with the good safety characteristics of LFP batteries, this makes LFP a good potential replacement for lead-acid batteries in many applications such as automotive and solar applications, provided the charging systems are adapted not to damage the LFP cells through excessive charging voltages (beyond 3.6 volts DC per cell while under charge), temperature-based voltage compensation, equalisation attempts or continuous trickle charging. The LFP cells must be at <b>least</b> balanced <b>initially</b> before the pack is assembled and a protection system {{also needs to be}} implemented to ensure no cell can be discharged below a voltage of 2.5 V or severe damage will occur in most instances.|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{kinetics}} is {{the measurement}} {{and interpretation of}} chemical reaction rates. There are two main reasons to study the rate of a chemical reaction. First, kinetics provides a powerful tool to determine {{the values of the}} rate equation as a function of state variables. Second, kinetics {{may not be the most}} efficient tool to investigate any reaction mechanism; however, together with complementary evidence from other techniques, kinetic analysis is useful for the understanding of the mechanism during a chemical reaction. For heterogeneous reactions, such as thermal decomposition of biomass, the reaction involves at <b>least</b> one <b>initially</b> solid reactant. The chapter presents a case study of isothermal kinetic analysis of biomass derived materials by a pyrolysis microreactor connected to online mass spectrometry. It is separated into three parts: (i) instrument and operating conditions; (ii) kinetic evaluation procedure; (iii) formal kinetic parameters and some technical applications...|$|R
