40|$|The study {{detailed}} in this dissertation {{focuses on the}} force/displacement and energy absorption performances of circular AA 6061 -T 6 aluminium alloy extrusions subjected to novel cutting deformation modes under both dynamic and quasi-static axial loading conditions. The experimental investigation of this novel cutting deformation mode on the circular AA 6061 -T 6 extrusions was completed utilizing a specially designed cutter {{with or without the}} presence of a deflector. Experimental results showed that the cutting deformation mode exhibited higher crush force efficiency of 94. 2 % and eliminated the high peak crush force associated with the progressive folding or global bending deformation mode. Factors that influence the cutting deformation mode were investigated. Testing results showed that slight difference of the cutter geometries and extrusion diameters had no significant influence on the load/displacement response of the extrusions. An increasing, almost linear, relationship was observed between the steady-state cutting force and the extrusion wall thickness/number of <b>cutter</b> <b>blades.</b> Moreover, controlling the load/displacement response through varying instantaneous extrusions wall thickness along the axis of the specimens was investigated. Experimental results showed a direct relationship between the cutting force and instantaneous wall thickness of the extrusion exists. Additionally, numerical simulations of the axial cutting deformation process employing an Eulerian finite element formulation method and the axial crushing deformation process employing a Lagrangian finite element formulation method were performed. Good predictive capabilities were observed for both configurations. Finally, a theoretical study of steady-state cutting circular extrusion by a <b>cutter</b> with multiple <b>blades</b> with/without a deflector was conducted. It is assumed that the extrusion will deform similar to the experimental observations and dissipate energies through the following plastic or fracture deformations: (1) far-field moving hinge line with the advance of cutter blade; (2) far-field membrane deformation near the intersection zone between the <b>cutter</b> <b>blade</b> and blade shoulder; (3) near blade tip circumferential membrane stretching; (4) continuous chip formation ahead of the cutter blade; and (5) cut petalled sidewalls bending outwards.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{fabricate}} very large objects of arbitrarily complexity from various high density polymers, a hybrid {{approach has been}} developed in which layers are individually machined and then stacked together. The layers are obtained by moving a heated <b>cutter</b> <b>blade</b> along {{the periphery of the}} layer. The adjustable tool is held by a controllable gripper and manipulated by a sculpturing robot. During motion the shape of the blade is continuously adapted to the target geometry for the layer.

The synchronous control of the shape of the <b>cutter</b> <b>blade</b> is a multilevel optimization problem, involving 1) finding the shape of the blade that suffices to the minimum energy principle, 2) minimizing the deviation between shape curves on the layer and the blades profile curve, 3) finding the best fitting region of the blades profile curve for various curvature characteristics, 4) finding the best tool positions and the optimum tool path.

40|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of Spinal Cord Injuries (SCI) {{is characterized}} by an initial primary injury followed by secondary tissue damage. This involves the production of highly reactive species, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS) or free radicals, which cause damage to cell components and lead to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress {{plays a key role}} in the pathophysiology of SCI and it can be considered an hallmark for it (1); consequently alleviating oxidative stress could be an effective strategy for the therapeutic intervention of SCI. Melatonin is the major secretory product of the pineal gland and it is recognized as a potent antioxidant and immunomodulator (2). So, the aim of this study was to test the effects of melatonin administration in an organotypic slice culture model of adult Sprague Dawley rat spinal cord. Spinal cord slices were cultured for 7 days in vitro; than they were subjected to mechanical injury by <b>cutter</b> <b>blade</b> for the evaluation of melatonin effects on oxidative stress caused by damage. Four experimental group were used in this study: A) Control Group (CTR) – Organotypic spinal cord slice culture; B) Injury Group (INJURY) – Organotypic spinal cord slice culture mechanically injured by cutter blade; C) Treatment Group (INJURY+MEL) – Organotypic spinal cord slice culture mechanically injured by <b>cutter</b> <b>blade</b> and treated after 24 hours with melatonin for other 24 hours; E) Control Group with melatonin (CTR+MEL) – Organotypic spinal cord slice culture treated with melatonin for 24 hours.

The results obtained show that melatonin administration has a favorable influence on antioxidative processes enhancing SOD immunopositivity in organotypic spinal cord slice cultures.
