5|$|Food-borne {{pathogens}} {{that can}} survive on lettuce include <b>Listeria</b> monocytogenes, the causative agent of listeriosis, which multiplies in storage. However, despite {{high levels of}} bacteria being found on ready-to-eat lettuce products, a 2008 study found no incidences of food-borne illness related to listeriosis, possibly due to the product's short shelf life, indigenous microflora competing with the <b>Listeria</b> bacteria or inhibition of bacteria to cause listeriosis.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{tests show}} that fruit bodies have {{antimicrobial}} activity against several strains of drug-resistant bacteria that are pathogenic in humans. Extracts inhibit {{the growth of}} the Gram-negative bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and <b>Listeria</b> monocytogenes, and kill the Gram-positive species Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus agalactiae and S.pyogenes. A separate study demonstrated growth inhibition against Proteus vulgaris.|$|E
5|$|Several <b>Listeria</b> and Shigella species move inside host cells by usurping the cytoskeleton, {{which is}} {{normally}} used to move organelles inside the cell. By promoting actin polymerisation at one pole of their cells, they can form {{a kind of}} tail that pushes them through the host cell's cytoplasm.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{thermometers}} {{sensitive to}} temperatures of 37°C {{can be used}} by pathogens to activate infection-specific genes. For example, the upregulation of prfA, encoding a key transcriptional regulator of virulence genes in <b>Listeria</b> monocytogenes, was demonstrated by fusing the 5' DNA of prfA to the green fluorescent protein gene; the gene fusion was then transcribed from the T7 promoter in E. coli, and fluorescence was observed at 37°C but not at 30°C.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} linked to {{outbreaks}} of some food-borne illnesses, including <b>Listeria</b> monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum. The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. Shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage. Two outbreaks of E.coli in the United States have been linked to cabbage consumption. Biological risk assessments have concluded that there is the potential for further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have the potential to be transferred to cabbage, and from there to the end consumer.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid is {{effective}} against all clinically important Gram-positive bacteria—those whose cell wall contains {{a thick layer}} of peptidoglycan and no outer membrane—notably Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant enterococci), Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, the viridans group streptococci, <b>Listeria</b> monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium species (the latter being among the most susceptible to linezolid, with minimum inhibitory concentrations routinely below 0.5mg/L). Linezolid is also highly active in vitro against several mycobacteria. It appears to be very effective against Nocardia, but because of high cost and potentially serious adverse effects, authors have recommended that it be combined with other antibiotics or reserved for cases that have failed traditional treatment.|$|E

25|$|<b>Listeria</b> infections {{can cause}} {{pregnant}} women to miscarry; the first miscarriage {{attributed to the}} 2011 outbreak was reported in early October, in a woman living in Iowa. Pregnant women often are advised to avoid foods, such as unpasteurized cheese and hot dogs, that {{are known to have}} the potential to carry <b>Listeria,</b> but fruits such as cantaloupe had not previously been identified as sources of concern.|$|E
25|$|Non{{hemolytic}} streptococci rarely cause illness. However, weakly hemolytic group D beta-hemolytic streptococci and <b>Listeria</b> monocytogenes (which {{is actually}} a Gram-positive bacillus) {{should not be confused}} with nonhemolytic streptococci.|$|E
25|$|Listeriosis is an {{infection}} {{caused by the}} bacterium <b>Listeria</b> monocytogenes. The outbreak was determined to originate from Jensen Farms in Holly, Colorado after <b>Listeria</b> monocytogenes was found in cantaloupe samples at a Jensen Farms store in Denver, Colorado and at the farm's packaging plant. The batch of cantaloupes had been shipped out over a period from July 29 through September 10 to twenty-five states, including Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wyoming.|$|E
25|$|The most {{recently}} proposed subclass is the Class IIe, which encompasses those bacteriocins composed by {{three or four}} non-pediocin like peptides. The best example is aureocin A70, a four-peptide bacteriocin, highly active against <b>Listeria</b> monocytogenes, with potential biotechnological applications.|$|E
25|$|The 2011 United States {{listeriosis}} outbreak was {{a widespread}} outbreak of <b>Listeria</b> monocytogenes food poisoning across 28 US states {{that resulted from}} contaminated cantaloupes linked to Jensen Farms of Holly, Colorado. As of the final report on December 8, 2011, there were 30 deaths and 147 total confirmed cases {{since the beginning of}} the first recorded case on July 31, 2011. It was the worst foodborne illness outbreak in the United States, measured by the number of deaths, since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began tracking outbreaks in the 1970s, or tied with the worst, an outbreak of <b>listeria</b> from cheese in 1985, depending on which CDC report is used.|$|E
25|$|Many {{different}} bacteria form biofilms, including gram-positive (e.g. Bacillus spp, <b>Listeria</b> monocytogenes, Staphylococcus spp, and {{lactic acid}} bacteria, including Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis) and gram-negative species (e.g. Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Cyanobacteria also form biofilms in aquatic environments.|$|E
25|$|Some weakly beta-hemolytic species cause intense beta {{hemolysis}} when grown {{together with}} a strain of Staphylococcus. This is called the CAMP test. Streptococcus agalactiae displays this property. Clostridium perfringens can be identified presumptively with this test. <b>Listeria</b> monocytogenes is also positive on sheep's blood agar.|$|E
25|$|Intracellular {{bacteria}} need {{to enter}} host cells (cells of the infected organism) {{in order to}} replicate and propagate infection. Many species of Shigella (causes bacillary dysentery), Salmonella (typhoid fever), Mycobacterium (leprosy and tuberculosis) and <b>Listeria</b> (listeriosis), to name but a few, are intracellular.|$|E
25|$|Most newborn {{infants with}} CAP are hospitalized, {{receiving}} IV ampicillin and gentamicin {{for at least}} ten days to treat the common causative agents streptococcus agalactiae, <b>listeria</b> monocytogenes and escherichia coli. To treat the herpes simplex virus, IV acyclovir is administered for 21 days.|$|E
25|$|If {{the mixture}} {{produces}} bubbles or froth, the organism {{is said to}} be 'catalase-positive'. Staphylococci and Micrococci are catalase-positive. Other catalase-positive organisms include <b>Listeria,</b> Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Burkholderia cepacia, Nocardia, the family Enterobacteriaceae (Citrobacter, E. coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Shigella, Yersinia, Proteus, Salmonella, Serratia), Pseudomonas, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Rhodococcus equi.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{and dairy}} {{products}} {{have the potential for}} causing serious infection in newborn infants. Unpasteurized milk and cheeses can promote the growth of <b>Listeria</b> bacteria. <b>Listeria</b> monocytogenes can also cause serious infection in an infant and pregnant woman and can be transmitted to her infant in utero or after birth. The infection has the potential of seriously harming or even causing the death of a preterm infant, an infant of low or very low birth weight, or an infant with an immune system defect or a congenital defect of the immune system. The presence of this pathogen can sometimes be determined by the symptoms that appear as a gastrointestinal illness in the mother. The mother can also acquire infection from ingesting food that contains other animal products such as, hot dogs, delicatessen meats, and cheese.|$|E
25|$|Tryptic (trypticase) soy agar (TSA) is a {{general-purpose}} medium {{produced by}} enzymatic digestion of soybean meal and casein. It is frequently the base medium of other agar types; for example, {{blood agar plates}} are made by enriching TSA plates with blood. TSA plates support growth of many semifastidious bacteria, including some species of Brucella, Corynebacterium, <b>Listeria,</b> Neisseria, and Vibrio.|$|E
25|$|The genes {{encoding}} alpha-toxin (Clostridium perfringens), Bacillus cereus PLC (BC-PLC), and PLCs from Clostridium bifermentans and <b>Listeria</b> monocytogenes {{have been}} isolated and nucleotides sequenced. There is significant homology of the sequences, approximately 250 residues, from the N-terminus. Alpha-toxin has an additional 120 residues in the C-terminus. The C-terminus of the alpha-toxin {{has been reported}} as a “C2-like” domain, referencing the C2 domain found in eukaryotes {{that are involved in}} signal transduction and present in mammalian phosphoinositide phospholipase C.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{collected}} or {{stored in}} unsanitary conditions may harbor {{a host of}} disease-causing organisms (pathogens), such as tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis), the bacteria Campylobacter (Campylobacteriosis), Escherichia E. coli O157:H7), <b>Listeria</b> (Listeriosis), Salmonella (Salmonellosis), Yersinia (Yersinia enterocolitica), and Brucella (Brucellosis). Pasteurization consistently removes all of these pathogens, though they can be reintroduced if the product is handled carelessly. Thus dairy farms that pasteurize their milk can have unsanitary facilities without the attendant outbreaks of disease that would occur if a raw milk dairy kept its herds in similar unsanitary conditions.|$|E
25|$|Officials from Maple Leaf {{believe that}} the {{outbreak}} originated sometime in July on line 8 or line 9 of the North York facility. Regardless, the entire plant has undergone intense sanitation, which began August 21. About 80 workers {{were involved in the}} cleanup, with additional outside experts and microbiologists supervising the operation. They used peroxyacetic acid, quaternary ammonium compound, isopropyl alcohol, refrigeration gel and a granular compound to disinfect the parts of the apparatuses. About 600 employees were to attend a four-hour training session on <b>Listeria</b> and on cleanliness, and about 250 employees were laid off while the plant was being cleaned.|$|E
25|$|People with {{weakened}} immune systems, such as elderly, children, {{and those}} with certain diseases or conditions, are most at risk for severe infections from pathogens that can contaminate raw milk. In pregnant women, <b>Listeria</b> monocytogenes-caused illness can result in miscarriage, fetal death, or illness or death of a newborn infant, and Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection {{has been linked to}} hemolytic uremic syndrome, a condition that can cause kidney failure and death. Other groups, such as the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition and American Academy of Pediatrics, also warn that raw milk is dangerous, especially for children.|$|E
25|$|Infants {{can acquire}} lung infections before birth by {{breathing}} infected amniotic fluid {{or through a}} blood-borne infection which crossed the placenta. Infants can also inhale contaminated fluid from the vagina at birth. The most prevalent pathogen causing CAP in newborns is Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as group-B streptococcus (GBS). GBS causes {{more than half of}} CAP in the first week after birth. Other bacterial causes of neonatal CAP include <b>Listeria</b> monocytogenes and a variety of mycobacteria. CAP-causing viruses may also be transferred from mother to child; herpes simplex virus (the most common) is life-threatening, and adenoviridae, mumps and enterovirus can also cause pneumonia. Another cause of CAP in this group is Chlamydia trachomatis, acquired at birth but not causing pneumonia until two to four weeks later; it usually presents with no fever and a characteristic, staccato cough.|$|E

500|$|Bacteria have {{developed}} ways to survive inside phagocytes, where {{they continue to}} evade the immune system. To get safely inside the phagocyte they [...] express proteins called invasins. When inside the cell they remain in the cytoplasm and avoid toxic chemicals contained in the phagolysosomes. Some bacteria prevent the fusion of a phagosome and lysosome, to form the phagolysosome. Other pathogens, such as Leishmania, create a highly modified vacuole inside the phagocyte, which helps them persist and replicate. Some bacteria are capable of living inside of the phagolysosome. Staphylococcus aureus, for example, produces the enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase, which break down chemicals—such as hydrogen peroxide—produced by phagocytes to kill bacteria. Bacteria may escape from the phagosome before {{the formation of the}} phagolysosome: <b>Listeria</b> monocytogenes can make a hole in the phagosome wall using enzymes called listeriolysin O and phospholipase C.|$|E
500|$|The {{complex is}} found in {{cellular}} regions characterized by dynamic actin filament activity: in macropinocytic cups, in {{the leading edge of}} motile cells (lamellipodia), and in motile actin patches in yeast. In mammals and the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum [...] it is required for phagocytosis. The complex has also been shown {{to be involved in the}} establishment of cell polarity and the migration of fibroblast monolayers in a wound-healing model. In mammalian oocytes, the Arp2/3 complex is involved in oocyte asymmetric division and polar body emission, which result from the failure of spindle migration (a unique feature of oocyte division) and cytokinesis. Moreover, enteropathogenic organisms like <b>Listeria</b> monocytogenes and Shigella use the Arp2/3 complex for actin-polymerization- dependent rocketing movements. The Arp2/3 complex also regulates the intracellular motility [...] of endosomes, lysosomes, pinocytic vesicles, and mitochondria. Moreover, recent studies show that the Arp2/3 complex is essential for proper polar cell expansion in plants. Arp2/3 mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana result in abnormal filament organization, which in turn affects the expansion of trichomes, pavement cells, hypocotyl cells, and root hair cells.|$|E

2500|$|Hot {{dogs are}} also singled out and {{attacked}} for containing ingredients {{commonly found in}} prepared meat products. [...] An unopened package of franks contains ingredients that {{have the potential for}} promoting the growth of <b>Listeria</b> bacteria. <b>Listeria</b> monocytogenes can also cause [...] serious infections in infants [...] and pregnant women, and can be transmitted to an infant in utero or after birth. [...] Adults with suppressed immune systems can also be negatively affected. Prevention involves heating the hot dogs to a temperature that will kill pathogens.|$|E
2500|$|An {{investigation}} by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that the contaminated cantaloupe harvest contained four separate <b>Listeria</b> monocytogenes strains, which the governmental agency found to be [...] "unusual", but {{was still trying to}} determine the reason. On October 20, it was reported that the FDA officials had found <b>listeria</b> on dirty, corroded equipment used by Jensen Farms, which had been bought used and was previously utilized for potato farming. It was stated by the government that the [...] "equipment's past use may {{have played a role in}} the contamination". Water contaminated with <b>listeria</b> was also found on the floor of the packing plant and it was determined that the workers moving around the plant had spread it, as the contaminated water was also found on the cantaloupe conveyor belt. It was noted by officials that Jensen Farms had [...] "passed a food safety audit by an outside contractor" [...] six days before the outbreak.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{pathogens}} {{of concern}} in T cell deficiencies are intracellular pathogens, including Herpes simplex virus, Mycobacterium and <b>Listeria.</b> [...] Also, fungal infections are also more common and severe in T cell deficiencies.|$|E
