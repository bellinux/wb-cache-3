Rebound insomnia, however, is more common upon discontinuation of intermediate-acting benzodiazepines than longer-acting benzodiazepines.

5|$|Oral {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for the short-term treatment of moderately severe insomnia {{in people who}} have not reacted adequately to other hypnotics, and who have persistent trouble in falling asleep. Because of midazolam's extremely short duration, it is not used for people who have trouble staying asleep through the night; moderate- to long-acting benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, and <b>lormetazepam,</b> are used for those purposes. Midazolam and other benzodiazepines may cause a deterioration in sleep quality.|$|E
2500|$|It {{can be too}} {{difficult}} to withdraw from short- or intermediate-acting benzodiazepines because of {{the intensity of the}} rebound symptoms felt between doses. Moreover, short-acting benzodiazepines appear to produce a more intense withdrawal syndrome. For this reason, discontinuation is sometimes carried out by first substituting an equivalent dose of a short-acting benzodiazepine with a longer-acting one like diazepam or chlordiazepoxide. Failure to use the correct equivalent amount can precipitate a severe withdrawal reaction. Benzodiazepines with a half-life of more than 24 hours include chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, clobazam, clonazepam, chlorazepinic acid, ketazolam, medazepam, nordazepam, and prazepam. [...] Benzodiazepines with a half-life of less than 24 hours include alprazolam, bromazepam, brotizolam, flunitrazepam, loprazolam, lorazepam, <b>lormetazepam,</b> midazolam, nitrazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam. The resultant equivalent dose is then gradually reduced. The reduction rate used in the Heather Ashton protocol calls for eliminating 10% of the remaining dose every two to four weeks, depending on the severity and response to reductions with the final dose at 0.5mg dose of diazepam or 5mg dose of chlordiazepoxide.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>lormetazepam</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with adversely affecting immediate and delayed recall memory functions, studies have shown that lormetazepam's amnesic properties may be lesser compared to other hypnotic benzodiazepines. For example, in a 1984 study comparing the amnesic effects of <b>lormetazepam</b> to temazepam and flurazepam showed that amnesia was smallest after <b>lormetazepam</b> and greatest after temazepam, which had produced greater amnesia than both <b>lormetazepam</b> and flurazepam by a significant margin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lormetazepam</b> {{and other}} {{benzodiazepine}} drugs act as positive modulators at the GABAA benzodiazepine receptor complex. <b>Lormetazepam</b> binds to the benzodiazepine receptor {{which in turn}} enhances {{the effect of the}} GABAA receptor producing its therapeutic effects as well as adverse effects. When <b>lormetazepam</b> binds to the benzodiazepine receptor sites in sufficient quantities it produces sedation which is used clinically as a therapeutic treatment for insomnia. <b>Lormetazepam</b> alters the brain electrical activity which has been studied via EEG readings. <b>Lormetazepam</b> appears to be more selective in the type of benzodiazepine receptor it binds to showing a higher affinity for the omega 1 receptor which is responsible for sedation. Changes in EEG can therefore be used to measure the sedative sleep promoting properties of <b>lormetazepam.</b>|$|E

50|$|Side {{effects of}} <b>lormetazepam</b> {{are similar to}} those of other {{hypnotic}} benzodiazepines and can for the most part be regarded as a class effect. In a sleep study, 1 mg <b>lormetazepam</b> increased total sleep time, reduced wakefulness, but did not alter REM sleep. However, at 2 mg doses, there were significant increases in stage 3 sleep and reductions in REM sleep. Rebound effects have been reported after chronic use including rebound REM. In one clinical trial with patients who had prior experience with older hypnotics temazepam and nitrazepam, most preferred <b>lormetazepam</b> due to less heavy sedation, amnesia, and residual effects. Some side effects, including drowsiness, amnesia, and respiratory depression, are increased when <b>lormetazepam</b> is combined with other drugs with similar effects, e.g. alcohol and nonbenzodiazepine drugs.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lormetazepam</b> (INN, or methyl-lorazepam, {{is a drug}} {{which is}} a short to {{intermediate}} acting 3-hydroxy benzodiazepine derivative. It possesses hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lormetazepam</b> as {{with other}} benzodiazepines is {{generally}} only recommended for short-term use (2-4 weeks) due to tolerance and loss of efficacy. Tolerance to and loss of the sedative effects of benzodiazepine hypnotics occurs within 14 days of regular use.|$|E
5000|$|Residual [...] "hangover" [...] effects after {{nighttime}} {{administration of}} <b>lormetazepam</b> such as sleepiness, impaired psychomotor and cognitive functions may persist {{into the next}} day which may impair the ability of users to drive safely and increase risks of falls and hip fractures.|$|E

50|$|Benzodiazepines {{require special}} {{precaution}} if used during pregnancy, in children, in alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. <b>Lormetazepam</b> may be unsuitable {{for the elderly}} due to residual effects on memory and body sway which may result in falls.Lormetazepam causes impaired driving skills, thus caution is required in individuals who drive or operate machinery.|$|E
50|$|Dependence is {{the medical}} term for addiction. Dependence {{can either be}} {{psychological}} and/or physical.Psychological dependence can manifest itself as a reliance on a drug to cope with everyday life or {{in the form of}} craving.Physical dependence occurs due to physiological adaptations occurring as the body attempts to overcome the drugs effects which is known as tolerance and the continuing need to take the drug to avoid or suppress withdrawal symptoms which can sometimes resemble the original condition being treated. When the dose or the drug is discontinued withdrawal symptoms typically occur. <b>Lormetazepam</b> as with all other benzodiazepines produces both physical and psychological dependence but the main problem of concern is physical dependence which appears {{in the form of the}} benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome after the dosage is reduced or the drug is stopped completely. The dependence induced by <b>lormetazepam</b> is related to changes in the sensitivity of the GABA-BZD receptor complex.|$|E

50|$|ZK-93426 (ethyl-5-isopropoxy-4-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) {{is a drug}} {{from the}} beta-carboline family.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{residual}} effects of <b>lormetazepam</b> on daytime vigilance, psychomotor performance and simulated driving in adult healthy volunteers. MATERIAL: Twelve subjects (7 women, 5 men), aged 27 - 38 years (mean 31). METHOD: Subjects received <b>lormetazepam</b> 1 mg tablet and placebo for 3 days at nighttime in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design, with a 1 -week interval between medications. On the morning following the last drug administration, the subjects completed a 15 -min battery of neuropsychological tests aimed at assessing memory and attention, performed simple and choice visual reaction times, and self-rated their own level of sleepiness using the Epworth sleepiness scale. Afterwards, an interactive, computer-based driving simulator (STISIM) {{was used to}} assess the effect of the study drugs on driving ability, followed by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). RESULTS: The findings showed that participants had similar performance when treated with <b>lormetazepam</b> and placebo. Indeed, as compared with baseline, neuropsychological tests, visual reaction times, sleep latency using the MSLT and driving ability showed no deterioration following either placebo or active medication. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that 3 -day use of <b>lormetazepam</b> 1 mg/day neither influences daytime vigilance nor impairs psychomotor task performance and simulated driving. Results confirm previous evidence that the intermediate-acting hypnotic benzodiazepine <b>lormetazepam</b> is devoid of residual effects in respect to psychomotor ability.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Lormetazepam</b> is a {{hypnotic}} benzodiazepine {{currently used}} {{in the treatment of}} insomnia. When this agent is used appropriately, its pharmacologic properties predict a high therapeutic index with a good tolerability profile. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim {{of this study was to}} compare the effects on psychomotor performance of <b>lormetazepam</b> and placebo in healthy young adult subjects. A secondary objective was to evaluate the clinical tolerability of <b>lormetazepam.</b> METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind,placebo-controlled, crossover study in healthy young adult volunteers. All volunteers received single doses of <b>lormetazepam</b> 1 mg and placebo, with a 1 -week interval between doses. The primary study variables were visual simple reaction time (VSRT) and visual choice reaction time (VCRT), measured before dosing with <b>lormetazepam</b> or placebo and at 20, 60, 120, 180, 240, and 360 minutes after dosing using a standard computerized apparatus. To increase the sensitivity of the results, visual reaction times were also recorded using a validated mobile computerized device. Secondary variables were the duration and quality of sleep on the night before each study session, rated by subjects using a 100 -mm visual analog scale; the Epworth Sleepiness Scale for daytime drowsiness; and the Critical Flicker Fusion Threshold test. Spontaneously reported adverse events were recorded and monitored throughout the study. RESULTS: The study included 18 healthy young adult volunteers (12 women, 6 men; mean [SD] age, 26. 7 [2. 8] years [range, 21 - 30 years]; mean body weight, 58 [9. 5] kg). There were no significant differences in either VSRT or VCRT after administration of <b>lormetazepam</b> or placebo. Independent of study drug but consistent with the accepted range of variability between the 2 devices, overall reaction times were significantly shorter with the use of the mobile device compared with the standard apparatus (P < 0. 01). Analysis of the results showed no sequence effects or other evidence of learning. There were no changes in the secondary study variables after administration of the test drugs. Administration of <b>lormetazepam</b> was associated with dizziness in 2 subjects, in 1 case occurring in association with somnolence. These adverse events were mild and subsided spontaneously 3 hours after drug intake. After administration of placebo, 1 subject reported slight somnolence 60 minutes after dosing that persisted through 180 minutes...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lormetazepam</b> is a {{benzodiazepine}} {{widely used}} as a hypnotic for management of insomnia.

40|$|One {{group of}} 10 young {{subjects}} were tested twice; in one test session 2 mg <b>lormetazepam,</b> {{in the other}} session placebo was administered, in random order. One subject dropped out. In one test session contractile force measurements were made six times; one measurement took place before treatment and the other measurements after treatment with the study medication. Each measurement of contractile force consisted of pushing weights of 0 to 10 kg and exerting maximal force. The corresponding electromyogram (EMG) of the gastrocnemius muscle was recorded. For the forces of 0 to 10 kg the regression was established of EMG on contractile force. Treatment effects on memory were investigated {{by means of a}} selection of tests, covering short‐term and long‐term memory, in terms of recall and recognition. Analyses of covariance were performed on the regression coefficients of EMG/ contractile force and on the data of maximally exerted force, the pre‐treatment scores serving as covariate. These analyses did not result in any difference for the two treatment conditions, leading {{to the conclusion that the}} administration of <b>lormetazepam</b> did not have any direct action on the contractile systems of human muscle. The t‐tests performed on the memory data resulted in a significant impairment of performance on the long‐term memory tasks, whereas short‐term memory was not impaired. It is concluded that, in accordance with previous research, the administration of <b>lormetazepam</b> results in an impairment in the acquisition of new information in long‐term memory, but also in impaired retention.
