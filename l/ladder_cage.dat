5|$|The {{main event}} was a King of the Mountain {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship with Kevin Nash as Special Guest Ringside Enforcer between then-champion Samoa Joe and the challengers Booker T, Christian Cage, Rhino, and Robert Roode. In a King of the Mountain match, the {{objective}} is to climb a ladder and hang the championship belt on a hook above the ring. In order to do so, a wrestler must first qualify by either pinning or making another wrestler submit in the match. A wrestler who is pinned or made to submit is this placed in a penalty box for two minutes. The match is fought under no disqualification rules. Booker T was the first to qualify by pinning Rhino after slamming him back-first into the mat with his signature Book End maneuver. Rhino was this placed in the penalty box. Roode was the next to qualify after bashing a <b>ladder</b> <b>Cage</b> held with a chair into him and following with a pin. Immediately afterwards, Rhino pinned Roode with a roll-up pin to qualify. Later, Joe held Booker T in his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold when Cage ascended a padded turnbuckle and jumped off onto Booker T and Joe. He followed by pinning Booker T to qualify and send Booker T to the penalty box. When Booker T was released from the box, he attacked Nash with the title belt and then attempted to hang it. Nash stopped him and then dropped Booker T back-first against the mat with his signature Jackknife Powerbomb maneuver. Joe was the last to qualify by pinning Roode after slamming him back and neck-first into the mat with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver. Joe then hung the title belt at 19 minutes and 49 seconds to win the competition.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} solve the {{problems}} of high feeding waste rate and low automated level which exist in the traditional feeding way, an automated feeding system for meat pigeon based on STM 32 was designed. The system is suitable for three <b>ladder</b> <b>cages.</b> The modular design was utilized for the control system with STM 32 being the control component, travel switch being the position detecting component and step motor being the dynamic component. The stroke control such as moving, stop and reversing was realized in automated feeding process, and meanwhile, the accuracy of the stroke control was ensured. The system is applicable to factory farming for meat pigeon with good stability...|$|R

SSQs have the general chemical formula (RSiO 1. 5) n, where R is usually a low-molecular-weight organic substituent or hydrogen, and are usually derived as oligomers with <b>ladder</b> or <b>cage</b> structures, 6 as shown in Fig. 1, and therefore {{can be regarded as}} organic-inorganic hybrids. Fabrication of an SOG film usually involves dissolving an SSQ oligomer in a solvent, spinning the solution onto a substrate to form a thin film, and then curing to form a glass via oligomeric conden-sation and bulk polymerization. Before curing the SOG has the prop-erties of a liquid gel. During curing the condensation and polymer-ization reactions generate a three-dimensional glassy structure bond...|$|R
40|$|Many tower silos {{are more}} than ten years old and {{beginning}} to show some signs of age. Before a silo is refilled, it should be inspected for conditions which could result in entry of air and water as well as structural integrity. Annually check the condition of the concrete walls and liners when the silo is empty. Cracks in the wall and doors should be sealed to exclude air. Holes in the roof should be repaired to exclude precipitation. Hoops should be checked for corrosion and tightness, and the integrity of the concrete should be evaluated by a qualified silo company representative. Annually check to assure the following. 路 Doors are in good repair and seal well to help exclude air. Hardware should be sound and properly attached to doors. 路 <b>Ladders</b> and <b>cages</b> should be sound and properly attached. 路 Floor drains are open and debris is removed from outside the silo to allow seepage to move away from silo walls. 路 Silo unloader cables and lifting equipment are checked for soundness. One way {{to reduce the number of}} trips up the silo during feed out is to perform preventive maintenance or replacement of the unloader before the silo is filled.

As a result, the penciler who worked on the comic book never drew the rear portions of their bodies. The rear edge of Narr's abdomen was always obscured by the foreground, while Vypex's serpentine body never ended.|$|R
