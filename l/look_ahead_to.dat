5|$|Duquesne {{suffered}} {{its final}} disappointment {{of the season}} on March 17 as it fell to the Princeton Tigers. Bill Clark remained suspended and Damian Saunders led the team with only 14 points. Duquesne dominated the game early on, taking a 20–11 lead before Princeton came back, eventually leading 28–23 at the half. The Dukes were unable to turn the momentum and continued to fall behind, eventually losing 51–65. The absence of Bill Clark showed on defense, as the Dukes were out-rebounded heavily. The Dukes also failed to improve on their issues from the regular season, going only 8 for 18 from the free throw line and 3 for 15 from 3-point range. This loss ended the 2009 season, and all Duquesne could do was <b>look</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>to</b> the next year.|$|E

25|$|Traditional cycle lanes {{increase}} vehicle/bicycle collisions. When exiting, a motorist must <b>look</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>to</b> avoid {{colliding with}} another vehicle or with pedestrians on a crosswalk. As the intersection curves {{away from the}} exit, the path of an exiting vehicle is relatively straight, and so the motorist may often not slow substantially. To {{give way to a}} cyclist on the outside, requires the exiting motorist to look toward the rear, to the perimeter. Other vehicles can obstruct the driver's view in this direction, complicating the motorist's task. The more frequent requirements for motorists to slow or stop reduce traffic flow. A 1992 study found that the risk to cyclists is high in all such intersections, but much higher when the junction has a marked bicycle lane or sidepath around its perimeter. Cycle lanes were installed at St. John's roundabout in Newbury, Berkshire, England and at Museum Road, Portsmouth, England. The cycle lanes at Museum Road were replaced by a narrowed carriageway to encourage lane sharing, while the St. John's roundabout retains perimeter cycle lanes.|$|E

He wanted his team to build on their FA Cup success {{and said that the}} Community Shield [...] "...will {{be the best way to}} prepare for the start of the League season next week." [...] Wenger was {{surprised}} his opponents Manchester City had taken midfielder Frank Lampard from their own franchise club New York City FC on loan; he questioned whether this was a way to bypass UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules. Of Bacary Sagna's move from Arsenal to Manchester City in the summer, Wenger told reporters: [...] "I made him a proposal to stay for three years, but he chose them. Had he chosen a long time ago? Maybe – it looks to me like he agreed it a long time before." [...] Wenger also revealed Arsenal had received offers for defender Thomas Vermaelen; on the day of the Community Shield match the player transferred to Barcelona.|$|E
2500|$|In 1960, the United States {{attempted}} {{to weaken the}} Cuban Economy by bombing {{thousands of acres of}} sugarcane fields. After the USSR and Cuba reestablished their diplomatic relations in May 1960, the USSR began to buy Cuban sugar in exchange for oil. When oil refineries like, Shell, Texaco, and Esso refused to refine Soviet oil, Castro nationalized that industry as well, taking over the refineries on the island. Days later in response, the United States cut the Cuban Sugar Quota completely, Eisenhower was quoted saying [...] "This action amounts to economic sanctions against, Cuba.

2500|$|The French {{endeavours}} at Keelung were {{of great}} interest to another predatory power in the region, the Empire of Japan. [...] In 1874 the Japanese had sent a punitive expedition to southern Taiwan, following the murder of shipwrecked Japanese sailors by Taiwanese aborigines, and Japanese expansionists already had their eye on Taiwan as a future Japanese colony. Following the failure of the Gapsin Coup in Korea in December 1884, Japan began to <b>look</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>to</b> an eventual showdown with China. [...] Although France and Japan never became formal allies during the Sino-French War (despite Chinese fears of such a possibility), Japan's naval and military leaders observed the performance of Admiral Courbet's squadron and Colonel Duchesne's Formosa expeditionary corps with keen professional interest. [...] The Japanese captain Tōgō Heihachirō, the future commander-in-chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy, [...] visited Keelung during the war aboard the corvette Amagi and was briefed by French officers on the tactics the French were using against the Chinese. Togo's guide was the young French engineering captain Joseph Joffre, who had been sent to Keelung to lay out the new French forts after Duchesne's March victory. [...] Commander-in-chief of the French Army {{at the start of the}} First World War and victor of the crucial Battle of the Marne in 1914, Joffre would end his military career as a Marshal of France.|$|E
