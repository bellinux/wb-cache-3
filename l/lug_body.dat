50|$|The Zorki 4 is {{basically}} a Zorki 3S with a self timer. It retained all of the features and strong points of the 3S. The early bodies have a vulcanite body covering, engraved shutter speeds, and strap <b>lugs.</b> Later <b>bodies</b> have fabric covering and the shutter speeds (1/60 and 1/30 instead of 1/50 and 1/25) are silk-screened. By the mid-1960s, the strap lugs had disappeared.|$|R
60|$|The {{monoplane}} curved about, and the keen {{fresh wind}} cut across Graham's {{face and his}} garment <b>lugged</b> at his <b>body</b> as the stem pointed round to the west. The two men looked into each other's eyes.|$|R
50|$|From nearby bars, {{soldiers}} and sailors raced to assist. On the street, firefighters <b>lugged</b> out <b>bodies</b> and were treated for burned hands. As night deepened, the temperature dropped. Water on cobblestone pavements froze. Hoses froze to the ground. Newspaper trucks were appropriated as ambulances. Smoldering bodies, living and dead, were hosed in icy water. Some victims had breathed fumes so hot that when they inhaled cold air, as one firefighter put it, they dropped like stones.|$|R

Then {{they pulled}} off the dead man's boots and put Jubiter Dunlap's old ragged shoes on the corpse and put the corpse's boots on Jubiter Dunlap. Then Jubiter Dunlap stayed where he was, and the other man <b>lugged</b> the dead <b>body</b> off in the twilight; and after midnight he went to Uncle Silas's house, and took his old green work-robe off of the peg where it always hangs in the passage betwixt {{the house and the}} kitchen and put it on, and stole the long-handled shovel and went off down into the tobacker field and buried the murdered man." ...|$|R
50|$|The McMillan TAC-50 is a {{manually}} operated, rotary bolt-action rifle. The large bolt has dual front locking <b>lugs,</b> and its <b>body</b> has spiral flutes {{to reduce}} weight. The heavy match-grade barrel, made by Lilja barrels, is also fluted to dissipate heat quickly and reduce overall weight and fitted with an effective muzzle brake to reduce recoil. The rifle {{is fed from}} detachable box magazines, holding 5 rounds each. The stock is made from fiberglass by McMillan Stocks, and {{is designed to be}} used from a bipod only. The buttstock is adjustable for length of pull with rubber spacers, and can be removed for compact storage. The rifle has no open sights; it can be used with a variety of telescopic or night sights.|$|R
50|$|The FNAB-43 uses a lever-delayed {{blowback}} system firing from the closed bolt position. The bolt is a two-piece unit with a pivoted lever interposed between bolt head and body. On firing the bolt head retracts {{and begins to}} rotate the lever, the base of which is against a <b>lug</b> in the <b>body.</b> This lever is pivoted to delay the opening movement to allow the bullet to leave the barrel. The breech pressure then drops before the lever has completed its rotation. The movement of the lever then presses the free end against the bolt body and accelerates the bolt's movement to the rear. The base of the lever then pulls clear of the lug and the whole bolt unit continues to recoil as one piece. On returning, the lever again engages the lug and pivots forward {{and in doing so}} removes a coupling which allows the firing pin to move only when the bolt is fully forward. This unusual and complicated system allows the rate of fire to be kept down to very practical 400 rpms without having to use a heavy bolt or strong spring.|$|R
2500|$|Margit lived a happy {{childhood}} {{until the}} age of eight, when she fell victim to rape. This was the first of three and perhaps the mildest one. She was an adventurous tomboy, who was pleased to do long rambles far away from home. She often took the family dog the long walks, but unfortunately it never accompanied her the times she fell victim to violences. The second rape occurred when she was ten years old and was exceptionally brutal. The rapists used the handle of an axe during the rape, thus causing lifelong injury to her. In other words, damaged her urethra, and after this she has to [...] "trot to a water closet" [...] every half an hour. The rape was performed by three (to her) unknown men in the ages 40 – 60 years old. Margit hid this terrible thing from everyone, including her own mother, until in the age of 60 when she took a close friend into confidence. Sandemo has dealt with these events in the 38th volume of the novel series Sagan om Isfolket, Små men kastar långa skuggor (in English: Small Men Throw Long Shadows). This time from a character's point of view. In October 2004, she stated in her interview given to Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet that she killed her third rapist. He was a wandering pedlar, to whom she fell victim to at the age of twelve. [...] In her own words, she killed this man by throwing a big rock at his head and then <b>lugged</b> the dead <b>body</b> down a hill and put and hid it in a ditch. The third rape revived both previous rapes and she flew into a fit of rage.|$|R
2500|$|After {{a series}} of adventures with Generation X, Howard gets {{a job as a}} {{department}} store Santa Claus, which gets him dragged to the North Pole, where the real Santa Claus has sold out to Hydra. [...] Howard goes through several dimensions, apparently through the power of Man-Thing, who can now talk but does not understand this ability, and lands on a version of Duckworld where his parents are essentially Ward and June Cleaver, he has a sister named Princess, and he is regarded as a hero because his activities on Earth-616 were recognized by Duckworld's version of Reed Richards. [...] This origin traces the source of these dimensions to be projections from Franklin's mind, though through the course of the adventure, Howard has a romance with Tana Nile, culminating in a kiss, after which he apologizes and tells her of his attachment to Beverly. When Franklin understands that he has shaped all these worlds, they find themselves back in Man-Thing's swamp. [...] While Man-Thing became a self-appointed guardian to Franklin Richards, Howard went off on his own and was captured by the Cult of Entropy, who wrapped him in swaddling clothes. [...] Although we last saw him in the swamp, he states that he was thrown into baggage and transported on a plane. [...] The cult wants him because he has part of the Nexus of All Realities, which shattered during Heroes Reborn, inside him, which he knows because it is making him nauseous. [...] Man-Thing enters his gullet, and Howard vomits him back out with the fragment, but the former is left desiccated and practically dead. He then encountered Namor, who thought he had slain the creature, but Howard explains {{that he would not be}} <b>lugging</b> his friend's <b>body</b> if that were the case. [...] Howard sets Man-Thing down in the water, and he revives during the conversation with Namor. [...] Once he sees that Man-Thing is alive and well, he bids Namor farewell and says he is returning to Cleveland.|$|R
