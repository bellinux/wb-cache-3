Today, scientists understand that there are limits to the how small or <b>large</b> <b>a</b> star can be.

These objects are known as brown dwarfs and represent {{the lower end of the}} stellar mass scale. Stars that are too large become unstable and explode in a supernova.|$|E

30|$|Most {{international}} relations theorists whose argument underscores {{the cause of}} bandwagoning find the bases of rationality mainly from material factors rather than non-material factors such as norms, ideas, identity or culture (Schweller 1994). However, the analytic framework of asymmetry proposes that the <b>larger</b> <b>A</b> can construct a new asymmetric relationship by proving the small B with sustainable leadership over and again in a long-term arrangement. The pivotal point of proving sustainable leadership is to ensure security and autonomy of the small B: if the <b>larger</b> <b>A</b> constantly provides the small B with sustainable leadership, the small B will show deference and respect to the <b>larger</b> <b>A.</b> In sum, the small B can assure its security and autonomy with the exchange of deference and respect to the <b>larger</b> <b>A.</b> However, the way the <b>larger</b> <b>A</b> and the small B cooperate in building an international structure to co-exist by confirming mutual interests is still questionable. In other words, when the <b>larger</b> <b>A</b> and the small B fail to construct a reliable arrangement to generate stability and peace based on mutual trust and understanding the asymmetric structure {{is more likely to}} keep producing misperception and suspicion.|$|R

30|$|All state {{relations}} in international politics are asymmetric and unequal. It is generally accepted among international relations scholars that asymmetric state relations cause unequal relations among those involved and small states have less choice in their relations to larger ones than {{the latter has}} with the relations of the former. While they have different emphases on the causes and consequences the relationship brings about, both realists and institutionalists have similar viewpoints {{on the structure of}} state {{relations in}} asymmetry. Nevertheless, the asymmetry among states does not always result in unequal relations. According to Brantly Womack (2003, 2006), the relationship between the larger states and small ones can be translated into mutual acceptance and recognition of communal interests. The obstacle of creating mutual and common interests usually results from the inattention of <b>larger</b> state, <b>A,</b> and overattention of small state, B, in the related conflicting areas. In asymmetric relations, the <b>larger</b> side, <b>A,</b> can do things to the smaller B that B cannot do in return in contrast to “symmetry,” where what A could do to B, B might likewise do to A. The asymmetric relations are more likely to cause tension and escalate conflicts because while the <b>larger</b> <b>A</b> has many other concerns aside from the small B, the small B’s main concern is the <b>larger</b> <b>A’s</b> action. Thus, the small B must be more attentive to actions by the <b>larger</b> <b>A,</b> while the <b>larger</b> <b>A’s</b> concern is principally related to the big picture of world affairs. For example, any minor threat from the <b>larger</b> <b>A</b> is critical to the small B, so the <b>larger</b> <b>A</b> and the small B react differently toward each other’s actions.|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Ka, {{which is a}} measure of how much energy is needed to stretch the bilayer, Kb {{is a measure of}} how much energy is needed to bend or flex the bilayer. Formally, bending modulus is defined as the energy required to deform a membrane from its intrinsic curvature to some other curvature. Intrinsic curvature is defined by the ratio of the diameter of the head group to that of the tail group. For two-tailed PC lipids, this ratio is nearly one so the intrinsic curvature is nearly zero. If a particular lipid has too <b>large</b> <b>a</b> deviation from zero intrinsic curvature it will not form a bilayer and will instead form other phases such as micelles or inverted micelles. Addition of small hydrophilic molecules like sucrose into mixed lipid lamellar liposomes made from galactolipid-rich thylakoid membranes destabilises bilayers into micellar phase. Typically, Kb is not measured experimentally but rather is calculated from measurements of Ka and bilayer thickness, since the three parameters are related.|$|E
5|$|The American kestrel {{is likely}} the most {{abundant}} falcon in North America, although its total population is difficult to quantify, as local populations can change quickly due to resource availability. Count data from the USGS Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) indicate that the North American breeding population is experiencing long-term and gradual but sustained declines, with some regions, such as New England and coastal California, exhibiting more rapid declines. Count data from raptor migration corridors also indicate regional population declines and largely corroborate BBS data. The North American population has been estimated at 1.2 million pairs, with the Central and South American populations being as <b>large.</b> <b>A</b> smaller estimate is 236,000 birds wintering in North America. A population increase occurred in the 18th and 19th centuries, probably due to deforestation for agriculture. The resulting pastures provided an ideal habitat for kestrels.|$|E

Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin is the current CDF, and assumed this position on 30 June 2014.

Another factor for not extending the tax system more broadly was the belief, present in both the North and the South, that the war would be of limited duration, and hence there was no compelling reason to increase the tax burden.|$|E

5|$|The {{problem of}} {{subjectivity}} and objectivity {{can be divided}} into a concern over the general possibilities of social actions, and, on the other hand the specific problem of social scientific knowledge.

The objective is often considered any public or external action or outcome, on up to society writ <b>large.</b> <b>A</b> primary question for social theorists is how knowledge reproduces along the chain of subjective-objective-subjective, that is to say: how is intersubjectivity achieved? While, historically, qualitative methods have attempted to tease out subjective interpretations, quantitative survey methods also attempt to capture individual subjectivities. Also, some qualitative methods take a radical approach to objective description in situ.|$|E
5|$|Though the broad-billed parrot {{may have}} fed {{on the ground}} and been a weak flier, its tarsometatarsus was short and stout, {{implying}} some arboreal characteristics. The Newton brothers and many authors after them inferred that it was flightless, due to the apparent short wings and large size shown in the 1601 Gelderland sketch. According to Hume, the underlying pencil sketch actually shows that the wings are not particularly short. They appear broad, as they commonly are in forest-adapted species, and the alula appears <b>large,</b> <b>a</b> feature of slow-flying birds. Its sternal keel was reduced, but not enough to prevent flight, as the adept flying Cyanoramphus parrots also have reduced keels, and even the flightless kakapo, with its vestigial keel, is capable of gliding. Furthermore, Hoffman's account states that it could fly, albeit with difficulty, and the first published illustration shows the bird on top of a tree, an improbable position for a flightless bird. The broad-billed parrot may have been behaviourally near-flightless, like the now-extinct Norfolk Island kaka.|$|E
