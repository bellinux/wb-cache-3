40|$|In the aftermaths of World War II, a {{mechanism}} for constitutional review was set up, to provide the system with means of reacting against infringements of the Supreme Law. Even though a Constitutional Court was established, the Italian system of constitutional adjudication is only partially inspired by Kelsen’s centralized model: actually, one its main features {{of the system is}} the cooperation between the Constitutional Court and ordinary courts. In the last decades, major changes have increased the system’s rate of decentralization, in connection with European integration and, most notably, with the new role for ordinary courts in the context of constitutional review. In this regard, the Constitutional Court required ordinary courts to refrain from submitting a question of constitutionality until they had examined – and excluded – the possibility of interpreting the provision at issue so as to render it constitutional.

40|$|Theories of {{statutory}} interpretation abound. Scholars, judges and commentators have long puzzled over {{the best method}} to locate {{the meaning of a}} statute and to this end have proposed a range of approaches that rely on various forms of evidence, including statutory text, <b>legislative</b> intent, agency <b>interpretations,</b> cultural norms, and judicial precedent.

The Constituent Assembly 1987 / 1988, which resulted in the current constitutional text, was marked by disputes in these areas, captained by representatives of landowners and small landowners and squatters, social movements fighting for land and militant black movement, so that the constitutional text is a reflection of these disputes and crystallization of the same, which is again brought up at the time of regulation by the <b>legislative</b> and constitutional <b>interpretation</b> by the judiciary. Through the study of land conflicts in Rio de Janeiro, with the lens of analysis of fighting lawsuits for conducting the policy of reform and regularization of the territories of former quilombolas communities, we want to understand how the disputes over the interpretation constitutionally established land rights have developed in the years following the Federal Constitution.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} interpretive {{provisions in}} human rights legislation in the United Kingdom (UK), New Zealand and two Australian jurisdictions: the Australian Capital Territory and the State of Victoria. It deals with the relationship between certain common law interpretive principles which protect {{human rights and the}} rules under the interpretive provisions. It also considers what effect the interpretive provisions have on the overall approach to statutory interpretation, particularly in terms of their impact on the roles of intention and purpose. One of the themes of the thesis is {{that it is possible to}} identify a common methodology for the application of the various interpretive provisions. This is facilitated by an emphasis on the concept of purpose, which is flexible and capable of being identified and applied at higher levels of abstraction than the concept of intention as commonly applied by the courts. Despite this common methodology, the results of attempts at <b>legislative</b> rights-consistent <b>interpretation</b> in the relevant jurisdictions differ. We shall see that the UK courts have taken a broader interpretive approach than have their New Zealand and Australian counterparts. This will be explained by reference to the respective contexts of the human rights legislation in each jurisdiction, particularly in terms of legislative history. It will be argued that the purpose of the UK legislation to provide remedies in domestic courts for breaches of the European Convention on Human Rights provides the basis for the UK courts’ approach. The absence of this factor is the primary point of distinction between the UK on the one hand, and New Zealand and Australia on the other, though other issues will be explored. Finally, while as a matter of the interpretation of the UK legislation, and especially of the relevant interpretive provision, the approach of the UK courts is defensible, the significant risk to the principle of legal certainty which it poses will be highlighted.

It fulfills the need for early mastery of specific skills in legal reasoning, research and writing which is crucial to the successful completion of legal studies and the pursuit of a career in law. The approach taken in Laying Down the Law develops legal reasoning, research and writing skills by its clear explanation of theory combined with practical advice, examples and exercises. Users can reinforce their understanding by practising, through the exercises, the many techniques used in legal decision-making, the analysis of legal problems and the essentials of legal research. Most of the changes made in this edition reflect recent developments in the law as practised. This edition contains a more detailed discussion of the role of policy in the adjudicative process, especially in the High Court. The chapters dealing with legislation, including <b>legislative</b> <b>interpretation,</b> have also been expanded. The research chapters reflect the improved resources available through the internet and the greater emphasis on electronic location and collection of both primary and secondary materials that has resulted.

40|$|Abstract : Democracy require {{protection}} of certain fundamental rights, {{but can we}} expect courts to follow rules? There seems little escape from the proposition that substantive constitutional review by an unelected judiciary is a presumptive abridgement of democratic decision-making. Once we have accepted the proposition that there exist human rights {{that ought to be}} protected, this should hardly surprise us. No one thinks courts are perfect translators of the rules invoked before them on every occasion. But it is equally clear that rules sometimes do decide cases. In modern legal systems the relative roles of courts and legislators with respect to the rules of the system is a commonplace. Legislatures make rules. Courts apply them in particular disputes. When we are talking about human rights, however, that assumption must be clarified in at least one way. The defense of the practice of constitutional review in this article assumes courts can and do enforce rules. This article also makes clear what is the meaning of “following rules”. Preference for judicial over <b>legislative</b> <b>interpretation</b> of rights, therefore, seems to hang {{on the question of whether}} or not judges are capable of subordinating their own judgment to that incorporated in the rules by their makers. This article maintains that, in general, entrenched constitutional rules (and not just constitutional courts) can and do constrain public conduct and protect human rights. The article concludes that the value judgments will depend on our estimate of the benefits we derive from the process of representative self-government. Against those benefits we will have to measure the importance we place on being able to live our lives with the security created by a regime of human rights protected by the rule of law.

Theoretical part is divided into four chapters. Firstly, I follow conception of social politics and social welfare during the time with future outlook. Then, the area of social services is being analysed - describing their evolution, <b>legislative</b> frame, <b>interpretation</b> of quality and ways of funding. Third chapter is dedicated to community planning, its foundations and principles. In last chapter I tend to target group - handicapped people. The aim of practical part is to find out not only under what conditions the timeframe of planning can be widen but also how exactly is social services planning being done and whether this process evolves towards better quality. All this by means of semistructured interviews with seven participants of social services planning in Písek. Respondents have been selected from the side of demand municipality of Písek and supply representants of non-governmental nonprofit organizations, church and region-donated organizations. Their posts varied from higher management to work force, both in current and previous years. Survey refers to demographic analysis of target group, respondents view of current planning timeframe´s sufficiency and whether quality level of that process is rising. Evaluated interviews showed that demographic analysis were professionally set up and last community planning in given area was significantly more successful compared with previous terms.
