At Destination X, Joe got himself disqualified in his return match against his old rival and Main Event Mafia member Scott Steiner. That same week on Impact!, Joe once again got disqualified this time in a match with Sheik Abdul Bashir. He took him backstage, hung him upside down, and tortured him.|$|E

Assurances were made that [...] "no personal data will be transferred in the eventual sale (since no personal data is kept)."

2500|$|A {{statement}} was issued on July 14, 2014 through the band's official Facebook page stating that Chicago area native Ronnie Platt (who had previously sung with Shooting Star) {{had been selected}} as the band's new lead vocalist and keyboard player: [...] "Kansas would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> lead vocalist and keyboardist Ronnie Platt as its newest member. Ronnie's first show with the band will be September 12 in Oklahoma City, OK, where he will take over singing duties for departing vocalist Steve Walsh." [...] On July 24, 2014, the band announced that their longtime lighting specialist David Manion would be handling the main keyboard parts for the band on stage along with Platt, giving the group a full-time keyboardist {{for the first time}} since Greg Robert`s departure in 1997. Manion had also handled keyboard responsibilities for Kansas' bassist and vocalist Billy Greer's band, Seventh Key.|$|E

Of issue, I should think there was none; though the colonel lived a year after the marriage.

6000|$|... "Like it? Well, I knew you'd {{understand}} what it meant. Mother thinks it's a little too rowdy-looking.

[...] "Couple of ladies here, somewhere, I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> you to. Came over with me from the depot last night. Very nice people, and I'd like to make it pleasant for them--get up something--go somewhere--and when you see their style you can judge what it had better be. Mrs. Vostrand and her daughter." ...|$|E

60|$|In {{telling about}} himself Burnamy touched only upon the points which he {{believed}} {{would take his}} listener's intelligent fancy, and he stopped so long before he had tired him that March said he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> him to his wife. He saw in the agreeable young fellow an image of his own youth, with some differences which, {{he was willing to}} own, were to the young fellow's advantage. But they were both from the middle West; in their native accent and their local tradition they were the same; they were the same in their aspirations; they were of one blood in their literary impulse to externate their thoughts and emotions.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes; I can {{understand}} that first-rate. I don't want to buy you; I want to borrow you. It's all right. See? Come round when you can; I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> you to old March. That's {{going to be our}} address." [...] He put a card on the table beside the envelope, and Beaton allowed him to go without making him take the check back. He had remembered his father's plea; that unnerved him, and he promised himself again to return his father's poor little check and to work on that picture and give it to Fulkerson for the check he had left and for his back debts. He resolved to go to work on the picture at once; he had set his palette for it; but first he looked at Fulkerson's check. It was for only fifty dollars, and the canny Scotch blood in Beaton rebelled; he could not let this picture go for any such money; he felt a little like a man whose generosity has been trifled with. The conflict of emotions broke him up, and he could not work.|$|E
60|$|One last remark occurs: It is {{the mark}} of genuine {{conversation}} that the sayings can scarce be quoted with their full effect beyond the circle of common friends. To have their proper weight they should appear in a biography, and with the portrait of the speaker. Good talk is dramatic, it is like an impromptu piece of acting where each should represent himself to the greatest advantage; {{and that is the}} best kind of talk where each speaker is most fully and candidly himself, and where, if you were to shift the speeches round from one to another, there would be the greatest loss in significance and perspicuity. It {{is for this reason that}} talk depends so wholly on our company. We should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> Falstaff and Mercutio, or Falstaff and Sir Toby; but Falstaff in talk with Cordelia seems even painful. Most of us, by the Protean quality of man, can talk to some degree with all; but the true talk, that strikes out all the slumbering best of us, comes only with the peculiar brethren of our spirits, is founded as deep as love in the constitution of our being, and is a thing to relish with all our energy, while yet we have it, and to be grateful for for ever.|$|E

[...] "There is the most prejudiced man living--he hates Mrs. Rook. Would you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> him? You're a philosopher; you may do him some good.

6000|$|He {{had no time}} to reply, for his servant {{had arrived}} with one of the {{dispensers}} of fortune; but as he turned away he wondered, {{in the light of the}} child's preference, about the towns of the interior. He was naturally exempt from the common doom. The officer who took him in hand, and who had a large straw hat and a diamond breastpin, was quite a man of the world, and in reply to the Count's formal declarations only said, [...] "Well, I guess it's all right; I guess I'll just pass you," [...] distributing chalk-marks as if they had been so many love-pats. The servant had done some superfluous unlocking and unbuckling, and while he closed the pieces the officer stood there wiping his forehead and conversing with Vogelstein. [...] "First visit to our country, sir?--quite alone--no ladies? Of course the ladies are what we're most after." [...] It was in this manner he expressed himself, while the young diplomatist wondered what he was waiting for and whether he ought to slip something into his palm. But this representative of order left our friend only a moment in suspense; he presently turned away with the remark quite paternally uttered, that he hoped the Count would make quite a stay; upon which the young man saw how wrong he should have been to offer a tip. It was simply the American manner, which had a finish of its own after all. Vogelstein's servant had secured a porter with a truck, and he was about to leave the place when he saw Pandora Day dart out of the crowd and address herself with much eagerness to the functionary who had just liberated him. She had an open letter in her hand which she gave him to read and over which he cast his eyes, thoughtfully stroking his beard. Then she led him away to where her parents sat on their luggage. Count Otto sent off his servant with the porter and followed Pandora, to whom he really wished to address a word of farewell. The last thing they had said to each other on the ship was that they should meet again on shore. It seemed improbable however that the meeting would occur anywhere but just here on the dock; inasmuch as Pandora was decidedly not in society, where Vogelstein would be of course, and as, if Utica--he had her sharp little sister's word for it--was worse than what was about him there, he'd be hanged if he'd go to Utica. He overtook Pandora quickly; she was in the act of introducing the representative of order to her parents, quite in the same manner in which she had introduced the Captain of the ship. Mr. and Mrs. Day got up and shook hands with him and they evidently all prepared to have a little talk. [...] "I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> you to my brother and sister," [...] he heard the girl say, and he saw her look about for these appendages. He caught her eye as she did so, and advanced with his hand outstretched, reflecting the while that evidently the Americans, whom he had always heard described as silent and practical, rejoiced to extravagance in the social graces. They dawdled and chattered like so many Neapolitans.|$|E
