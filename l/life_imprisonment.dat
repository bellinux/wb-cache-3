In recent years, Taiwanese betting syndicates have also been involved in illegal transborder Mark Six betting, often with the cooperation of their Hong Kong and mainland Chinese counterparts. In 2010, a Taiwanese woman named Lin Yuru was charged with the murder of her mother, mother-in-law and husband to obtain insurance money to pay off gambling debts incurred during betting on underground Mark Six tickets since 2003.

50|$|The Markham Gang was {{a notorious}} {{criminal}} organization located primarily in Ontario, Canada, {{in the middle}} of the 19th century.

40|$|Major {{increases}} in the punishment for Criminal Code offences of trafficking, commercial cultivation and manufacture of controlled drugs are under consideration by the Commonwealth government. The proposed increases would be effected by new model schedules of controlled drugs which would have two effects. First, the model schedules would extend the penalties of <b>imprisonment</b> for <b>life</b> and <b>imprisonment</b> for 25 years {{to a range of}} substances that are currently the subject of comparatively minor, regulatory penalties. Secondly, they would extend the penalties of <b>imprisonment</b> for <b>life</b> and <b>imprisonment</b> for 25 years to far smaller quantities of the existing class of controlled drugs. The model schedules are proposed as a model for uniform adoption in all Australian jurisdictions. They have already been adopted in South Australia. This article discusses the Commonwealth proposals with particular reference to the lack of evidence or argument to justify the dramatic {{increases in}} penalties proposed.
