Parameters which influence lightning performance of overhead distribution lines such as line height, line length, type of structure, availability of shield wire and flash density {{in the area are}} discussed in details. More over, failures due to transient overvoltages {{and its impact on the}} reliability of the network are analyzed in this study. Lightning may cause flashovers from direct strokes or induced voltage from nearby strokes. Direct lightning to power distribution lines causes insulation flashovers in great majority of the cases. Therefore the goal of this research is to estimate the lightning performance level of feeder lines and investigate improvements. Shielding effect from nearby trees, critical flashover voltages for different flashover paths and deterioration of insulation with aging are also discussed. Thus the analysis of lightning related incidents such as transformer failures, arrester failures and nuisance fuse blows are presented. The study of transformer installation reveals that arrester <b>lead</b> <b>length</b> becomes critical during a lightning discharge since it generates high voltage stress in the winding which may fail the distribution transformer. Earth rod impulse resistance is also an important parameter which increases the voltage stress. It is necessary to develop models, using, electrical parameters for simulation of transient overvoltages. The PSCAD software is especially developed to study transient simulations of power systems. Variation of transient overvoltages due to strikes to phase wires, strikes to earth wire, and variation due to striking distance are discussed in this study.

This paper describes a hybrid approach that substantially reduces the parasitic inductance between the driver and MOSFET gate as well as between the MOSFET source and its external connection. A flip chip assembly is used to directly attach the die-form power MOSFET and driver on a PCB.

Reducing congestion in our nation's urban areas has become a top priority of state departments of transportation nationwide. The development and construction of freeway management systems have recently begun to help reduce these problems. A major component of freeway management systems is the inductance loop detector. This research effort evaluated the use of inductance loop detectors in a freeway management situation to determine maximum permissible <b>lead</b> <b>lengths</b> and an optimal speed trap distance. <b>Lead</b> <b>lengths</b> were evaluated with five different design vehicles (large and small passenger cars, a pickup truck, a motorcycle, and a high profile truck) with several detector units. Both passenger cars and the pickup truck were always detected with 4000 feet (1220 metres) of lead wire on all combinations of sensitivity level and number of wire turns. The detection of the motorcycle and high profile truck depended upon the sensitivity level and number of wire turns used. The data also indicate that detection of the passenger vehicles may be possible at distances much greater than 4000 feet (1220 metres). An extrapolation of the inductance measurements indicate that detection of passenger vehicles at 8000 feet (2440 metres) is likely, and detections may even be possible at much large distances. <b>Lead</b> <b>lengths</b> of this magnitude give the designer greater flexibility in producing the most functional and cost-effective design. Five different speed trap distances (from 20 to 80 feet, 6 to 24 metres) were evaluated with a variety of detector units. An optimal speed trap distance was not able to be identified, but the research consistently identified that accurate speed measurements cannot be made using different models of detector units. In order for speed measurements to be accurate, the change in inductance required for detection must be very similar between detector units. Identical make and model detector units easily meet this criteria. The error measured for speed traps with identical detector units averaged about 1. 5 mph (2. 4 km/h) for all speeds, while errors for speed traps with different detector units varied widely from one to 120 mph (1. 6 to 194 km/h).

In Groups 2 and 3 retraction of the locking stylet within the lead was measured [lead tip-locking stylet distance (LTLSD) ]. Maximal forces for the three groups were: (i) 28. 3 ± 0. 3 N; (ii) 30. 6 ± 3. 0 N; (iii) 31. 6 ± 2. 9 N (1 vs. 2, P = 0. 13; 1 vs. 3, P = 0. 04; 2 vs. 3, P = 0. 65).

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 55 - 59. The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to develop a}} method to analyze currents on thin conductor structures inside the body during Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan based on Modified Transmission Line Method (MoTLiM). In this thesis, first, Active Implantable Medical Devices (AIMDs) are modeled and the tissue heating problem, which is a result of coupling between AIMD and incident Radio Frequency (RF) fields, is examined. Then, usage of MoTLiM to analyze the currents on the guidewires is shown by solving currents on guidewire when a toroidal transmit receive coil is used with guidewire. At first, a method to measure MoTLiM parameters of leads using a network analyzer is shown. Then, IPG case and electrode are modeled with a voltage source and impedance. Values of these parameters are found using the Modi- fied Transmission Line Method (MoTLiM) and the Methods of Moments (MoM) simulations. Once the parameter values of an electrode/IPG case model are determined, they can be connected to any lead, and tip heating can be analyzed. To validate these models, both MoM simulations and MR experiments are used. The induced currents on the leads with the IPG case or electrode connections are solved using the proposed models and MoTLiM. These results are compared with the MoM simulations. In addition, an electrode is connected to a lead via an inductor. The dissipated power on the electrode is calculated using MoTLiM by changing the inductance and the results are compared with the specific absorption rate results that are obtained using MoM. Then, MRI experiments are conducted to test the IPG case and the electrode models. To test the IPG case, a bare lead is connected to the case and placed inside a uniform phantom. During a MRI scan the temperature rise at the lead is measured by changing the <b>lead</b> <b>length.</b> The power at the lead tip for the same scenario is also calculated using the IPG case model and MoTLiM. Then an electrode is connected to a lead via an inductor and placed inside a uniform phantom. During a MRI scan the temperature rise at the electrode is measured by changing the inductance and compared with the dissipated power on the electrode resistance. Second, based on the similarity between currents on guidewires and transmission lines, currents on the catheter are solved with MoTLiM. Current distributions on an insulated guidewire are solved and B 1 distribution along the catheter is calculated. Effect of stripping the tip on the tip visibility is analyzed. It is shown that there is an increase in the B 1 at the insulation and bare guidewire boundary. Then, a characteristic impedance is defined for the guidewires and impedance seen at the point where guidewire is inserted into the body is calculated. It is shown with EM simulations that if the impedance converges to the characteristic impedance of the guidewire, tip visibility of the guidewire is lost. At last, a new method to measure electrical properties of a phantom material is proposed. This method is used for validation of the coaxial transmission line measurement (CTLM) fixture, which is designed for measurement of electrical properties of viscous phantom materials at MRI frequencies, and which is previously presented by our group. The new method depends on the phenomena of the lead tip heating inside a phantom during MRI scan. Electrical properties of a phantom are influential on the relationship between tip temperature increase and the <b>lead</b> <b>length.</b> MoTLiM is used and the relationship between the <b>lead</b> <b>length</b> and the tip temperature increase is formulated as a function of conductivity and permittivity of the phantom. By changing the <b>lead</b> <b>length,</b> the tip temperature increase is measured and the MoTLiM formulation is fitted to these data to find the electrical properties of the phantom. Afterwards the electrical properties of the phantom are measured with the CTLM fixture and the results that are obtained with both methods are compared for an error analysis. To sum, electrical models for the IPG case and electrode are suggested, and the method is proposed to determine the parameter values. The effect of the IPG case and electrode on tip heating can be predicted using the proposed theory. An analytical analysis of guidewire with toroidal transceiver is shown. This analysis is helpful for better usage and improvements of toroidal transceiver. Also, MoTLiM analysis can be extended to other MRI guidewire antennas. Açıkel, VolkanPh. D...|$|E

40|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) is {{an effective}} treatment for multiple movement disorders and shows substantial promise {{for the treatment of}} some neuropsychiatric and other disorders of brain neurocircuitry. Optimal neuroanatomical lead position is a critical determinant of clinical outcomes in DBS surgery. Lead migration, defined as an unintended post-operative displacement of the DBS lead, has been previously reported. Despite several reports, however, there have been no systematic investigations of this issue. This study aimed to: 1) quantify the incidence of lead migration in a large series of DBS patients, 2) identify potential risk factors contributing to DBS lead migration, and 3) investigate the practical importance of this complication by correlating its occurrence with clinical outcomes. A database of all DBS procedures performed at UF was queried for patients who had undergone multiple post-operative DBS lead localization imaging studies separated by at least two months. Bilateral DBS implantation has commonly been performed as a staged procedure at UF, with an interval of six or more months between sides. To localize the position of each DBS lead, a head CT is acquired ~ 4 weeks after lead implantation and fused to the pre-operative targeting MRI. The fused targeting images (MR + stereotactic CT) acquired in preparation for the delayed second side lead implantation provide an opportunity to repeat the localization of the first implanted lead. This paradigm offers an ideal patient population for the study of delayed DBS lead migration because it provides a large cohort of patients with localization of the same implanted DBS lead at two time points. The position of the tip of each implanted DBS lead was measured on both the initial post-operative lead localization CT and the delayed CT. Lead tip displacement, intracranial <b>lead</b> <b>length,</b> and ventricular indices were collected and analyzed. Clinical outcomes were characterized with validated rating scales for all cases, and a comparison was made between outcomes of cases with lead migration versus those where migration of the lead did not occur. Data from 138 leads in 132 patients with initial and delayed lead localization CT scans were analyzed. The mean distance between initial and delayed DBS lead tip position was 2. 2 mm and the mean change in intracranial <b>lead</b> <b>length</b> was 0. 45 mm. Significant delayed migration (> 3 mm) was observed in 17 leads in 16 patients (12. 3 % of leads, 12. 1 % of patients). Factors associated with lead migration were: technical error, repetitive dystonic head movement, and twiddler's syndrome. Outcomes were worse in dystonia patients with lead migration (p = 0. 035). In the PD group, worse clinical outcomes trended in cases with lead migration. Over 10 % of DBS leads in this large single center cohort were displaced by greater than 3 mm on delayed measurement, adversely affecting outcomes. Multiple risk factors emerged, including technical error during implantation of the DBS pulse generator and failure of lead fixation at the burr hole site. We hypothesize that a change in surgical technique and a more effective lead fixation device might mitigate this problem...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Current {{surgical}} {{techniques for}} retinal prosthetic implantation require long and complicated surgery, which {{can increase the}} risk of complications and adverse outcomes. METHOD: The suprachoroidal position is known to be an easier location to access surgically, and so this study aimed to develop a surgical procedure for implanting a prototype suprachoroidal retinal prosthesis. The array implantation procedure was developed in 14 enucleated eyes. A full-thickness scleral incision was made parallel to the intermuscular septum and superotemporal to the lateral rectus muscle. A pocket was created in the suprachoroidal space, and the moulded electrode array was inserted. The scleral incision was closed and scleral anchor point sutured. In 9 of the 14 eyes examined, the device insertion was obstructed by the posterior ciliary neurovascular bundle. Subsequently, the position of this neurovascular bundle in 10 eyes was characterized. Implantation and lead routing procedure was then developed in six human cadavers. The array was tunnelled forward from behind the pinna to the orbit. Next, a lateral canthotomy was made. Lead fixation was established by creating an orbitotomy drilled in the frontal process of the zygomatic bone. The lateral rectus muscle was detached, and implantation was carried out. Finally, pinna to lateral canthus measurements were taken on 61 patients in order to determine optimal <b>lead</b> <b>length.</b> RESULTS: These results identified potential anatomical obstructions and informed the anatomical fitting of the suprachoroidal retinal prosthesis.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of Phase II of a Federal Railroad Administration sponsored study looking at low-cost means to increase speeds through turnouts by retrofit or upgrade. To meet this objective, <b>lead</b> <b>length</b> and frog angle were considered fixed, eliminating the costs to relocate the frog or switch points. Based on extensive research, it was determined in Phase I that the best solution was to optimize the existing AREMA geometry by reducing the switch angle, incorporating a new diverging switch rail, and reshaping both the curved stock and closure rails. Dynamic simulations showed that higher speeds could be achieved over the optimized geometry without increasing peak wheel/rail forces experienced over the traditional geometry. In Phase II the new design was tested by retrofitting an AREMA # 20 crossover on New Jersey Transit. Full testing of the crossover included comparison with a standard AREMA # 20 based on lateral and vertical wheel/rail forces and lateral car body accelerations. From current observations and test results, the new turnout design meets the goal of providing a low-cost means to increase the speeds through existing turnouts. By establishing a superior geometry within the same dimensions as the AREMA standard, railroads {{will be able to make}} the necessary modifications at low cost and without the need of additional space. In addition, this approach, applicable to the large majority of existing turnouts, is expected to result in improved ride quality and decreased wear, leading to a longer service life and decreased maintenance costs...|$|E

The widely varying results {{described}} in literature suggest that there are many factors that influence the degree of heating and that not always are adequately addressed by existing testing methods. Methods We present a wide database of experimental measurements of the heating of metallic wires and PM leads in a 1. 5 T RF coil. The aim of these measurements is to systematically quantify the contribution of some potential factors involved in the MRI induced heating: the length and the geometric structure of the lead; the implant location within the body and the lead path; the shape of the phantom used to simulate the human trunk and its relative position inside the RF coil. Results We found that the several factors are the primary influence on heating at the tip. Closer locations of the leads {{to the edge of the}} phantom and to the edge of the coil produce maximum heating. The <b>lead</b> <b>length</b> is the other crucial factor, whereas the implant area does not seem to have a major role in the induced temperature increase. Also the lead structure and the geometry of the phantom revealed to be elements that can significantly modify the amount of heating. Conclusion Our findings highlight the factors that have significant effects on MRI induced heating of implanted wires and leads. These factors must be taken into account by those who plan to study or model MRI heating of implants. Also our data should help those who wish to develop guidelines for defining safe medical implants for MRI patients.

Each striation pattern of wire cut toolmark was characterized by the sequence of parallel fringes, grey level (0 – 255), for each point averaged over 10 pixels; three files were extracted to account for possible missalingment of the cut end of the wire. The fringe pattern for pliers was extracted in the same way from the image file created by merging 24 successive images. The prepared files are shown in Fig. 3. To map the location of increased matching probability between the fringe patterns of the wire cut and the pliers impression, we performed numerical and optical correlations. Optical measurements are realized by using the correlator (Fig. 1) with a film transparency (for displaying input images), a liquid crystal display (for displaying phase-only filters), and a CCD camera (for detecting output correlations). The obtained results are normalized to emphasize the true correlation maximum (Figs. 4 and 5). Evidently, both correlation procedures give similar results...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} investigating possible {{effects of}} exposure to the ambient radio frequency (RF) background on aspen seedlings was conducted in rural Colorado at an altitude of 1, 700 meters, on a north-facing slope in the Little Thompson River Valley. The location was 0. 5 km distant from any RF source, including electrical power lines. In the spring 2007, three treatment enclosures were established: RF shielded (Faraday-caged), mock-shielded, and unshielded. Nine aspen seedlings in gallon pots were placed in each treatment enclosure. All factors: light level, humidity, airflow and temperature were monitored and maintained at equal levels between the shielded and mock-shielded environments. The un-caged seedlings were exposed to higher light level (full sun), had higher airflow, and generally lower humidity, since they were not in a screened enclosure. After two months, the RF-shielded group had produced 74 % more active <b>lead</b> <b>length</b> and 60 % more leaf area than the mock-shielded group, though both groups produced nearly the same number of leaves. Differences in growth and morphology between the mock-shielded and unshielded groups were slight. In early October 2007, the shielded group’s leaves turned a range of bright fall colors, and those leaves were substantially free of leaf fungus. At the same time, in the two exposed groups, leaves were green-yellow and a high percentage of leaf area was affected by leaf fungus. These results suggest that the manmade RF environment may be adversely affecting growth, dormancy, and resistance to fungus in aspen seedlings. Inhibition of growth in aspen caused by exposure to the RF background would limit their ability to take up CO 2 and sequester carbon. This RF interaction with plants may, therefore, be indirectly contributing to the ongoing increase in atmospheric CO 2...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} drawing speed and heating length on {{deformation}} behavior was investigated by numerical approach for AZ 31 magnesium alloy tubes to realize high speed dieless drawing process. The length of deformation zone expands with increasing the feeding speed. The increase in heating <b>length</b> <b>leads</b> to expanding <b>length</b> of deformation zone. The mean strain rate increases with increasing the feeding speed firstly, and then {{rate of increase}} in the strain rate becomes gradual under condition of any length of heating band. Based on these results, a limiting reduction in area of 52. 5 % under higher speed and larger heating length conditions can be realized experimentally...|$|R
