Over {{the course of the}} past five decades, this technology has evolved into a highly specialized entity, also finding a niche market in the field of urology. Lasers obtained from various <b>lasing</b> <b>mediums</b> producing amplified light of different wavelengths have been tested for urological applications. Today, these lasers are most commonly used in the surgical management of benign prostatic hyperplasia and as intracorporeal lithotripters.

Technology has offered us newer <b>lasing</b> <b>mediums,</b> wavelengths and delivery systems. Pattern scan laser in proliferative diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema allows laser treatment that is less time consuming and less painful. Now, {{it is possible to}} deliver a subthreshold micropulse laser that is above the threshold of biochemical effect but below the threshold of a visible, destructive lesion thereby preventing collateral damage. The advent of solid-state diode yellow laser allows us to treat closer to the fovea, is more effective for vascular structures and offers a more uniform effect in patients with light or irregular fundus pigmentation.

40|$|The {{coherent}} {{control of}} atomic energy level population {{is important for}} several areas physics and engineering including fluorescent spectroscopy, resonantly enhanced multiphoton ionization, harmonic generation, remote sensing and lasing. At low intensities where the Stark shift can be neglected, coherent control mechanisms usually exploit resonances created from stationary energy states dressed by integer multiples of the photon energy. However, in the strong field limit where large laser pulse intensities lead to significant Stark shifts, the resonant conditions are dynamic both {{in time and space}} and will likely not be satisfied for the entire laser pulse or beam. In this research, we experimentally and theoretically demonstrate coherent control of atomic energy level population in sodium vapor as well as the selective excitation of sodium Rydberg levels using high intensity laser pulses. We also make a direct measurement of the ponderomotive shift of the continuum. While techniques based on resonance interferences and rapid adiabatic passage have been introduced for selective excitation, the conditions that must be satisfied for these phenomena can be hampered by short femtosecond pulse durations and large Stark shifts. In contrast, a technique referred to here as Resonance Sampling, uses the AC Stark shifts to selectively induce Freeman resonances and is resilient to changes in the spectral phase. Freeman resonances established in this way can result in population inversion of the excited state, and may lead to new <b>lasing</b> <b>mediums</b> and remote sensing applications.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the dynamic effect of {{nonlinearity}} on <b>lasing</b> in disordered <b>medium.</b> The third-order nonlinearity not only changes the frequency and size of lasing modes, but also modifies the laser emission intensity and laser pulse width. When the nonlinear response time is comparable to or longer than the lifetime of the lasing mode, the nonlinearity changes the laser output through modifying {{the size of the}} lasing mode. When the nonlinear response is much faster than the buildup of the lasing mode, positive nonlinearity always extracts more laser emission from the random medium due to the enhancement of single particle scattering.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study of}} the statistics of transmission ($t$) and reflection ($r$) of quasi-particles from a one-dimensional disordered <b>lasing</b> or amplifying <b>medium</b> is presented. The amplification is introduced via a uniform imaginary part in the site energies in the disordered segment of the single-band tight binding model.

The dopant concentration used is high: about 50% of the yttrium atoms are replaced. The Er:YAG laser wavelength couples well into water and body fluids, making this laser especially useful for medicine and dentistry uses; it is used for treatment of tooth enamel and in cosmetic surgery. Er:YAG is used for noninvasive monitoring of blood sugar. The mechanical properties of Er:YAG are {{essentially the same as}} Nd:YAG. Er:YAG operates at wavelengths where the threshold for eye damage is relatively high (since the light is absorbed before striking the retina), works well at room temperature, and has high slope efficiency. Er:YAG is pale green.|$|R
2500|$|Since the <b>lasing</b> <b>medium</b> {{was fairly}} small, a single bomb could host {{a number of}} them and attack {{multiple}} ICBMs in a single burst. The Soviet ICBM fleet had tens of thousands of warheads, but only about 1,400 missiles. If each satellite had two dozen lasers, two dozen satellites on-station would significantly blunt any attack. In Molniya orbits, where the satellites would spend much of their time over the USSR, only a few dozen satellites would be needed, in total. An article in Aviation Week and Space Technology described how the devices [...] "... are so small that a single payload bay on the space shuttle could carry to orbit a number sufficient to stop a Soviet nuclear weapons attack". Some time later Teller used similar language in a letter to Paul Nitze, who was preparing a new round of strategic limitations talks, stating that [...] "A single X-ray laser module the size of an executive desk... could potentially shoot down the entire Soviet land-based missile force..." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{applications}} {{where a small}} focused beam is needed, the waveguide must be made narrow, on {{the order}} of the optical wavelength. This way, only a single transverse mode is supported and one ends up with a diffraction-limited beam. Such single spatial mode devices are used for optical storage, laser pointers, and fiber optics. Note that these lasers may still support multiple longitudinal modes, and thus can lase at multiple wavelengths simultaneously. [...] The wavelength emitted {{is a function of the}} band-gap of the semiconductor material and the modes of the optical cavity. In general, the maximum gain will occur for photons with energy slightly above the band-gap energy, and the modes nearest the peak of the gain curve will lase most strongly. The width of the gain curve will determine the number of additional [...] "side modes" [...] that may also lase, depending on the operating conditions. [...] Single spatial mode lasers that can support multiple longitudinal modes are called Fabry Perot (FP) lasers. [...] An FP laser will lase at multiple cavity modes within the gain bandwidth of the <b>lasing</b> <b>medium.</b> [...] The number of lasing modes in an FP laser is usually unstable, and can fluctuate due to changes in current or temperature.|$|E
