500|$|The Cure's third single, [...] "Jumping Someone Else's Train", was {{released}} in early October 1979. Soon afterwards, Dempsey was dropped from the band because of his cold reception to material Smith had written for the upcoming album. Dempsey joined the Associates, while Simon Gallup (bass) and Matthieu Hartley (keyboards) from the Magspies joined the Cure. The Associates toured as support band for the Cure and the Passions on the Future Pastimes Tour of England between November and December—all three bands were on the Fiction Records roster—with the new Cure line-up already performing {{a number of new}} songs for the projected second album. Meanwhile, a spin-off band comprising Smith, Tolhurst, Dempsey, Gallup, Hartley, and Thompson, with backing vocals from assorted family and friends and lead vocals provided by their <b>local</b> <b>postman</b> Frankie Bell, released a 7-inch single in December under the name of Cult Hero. On 8 December 1979, the Cure were recorded from their first live TV special, at [...] in Paris, with three songs from the set, [...] "At Night", [...] "Three Imaginary Boys", and [...] "Killing An Arab", broadcast on 16 December.|$|E
6000|$|There {{seems to}} be no keeping {{anything}} from Old Moore. In April [...] "much dissatisfaction will be expressed among Post Office employees." [...] That sounds probable, on the face of it. In any event, I will answer for our <b>local</b> <b>postman.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Private Copper {{thought for}} a moment of a far-away housemaid who might still, if the <b>local</b> <b>postman</b> had not gone too far, be {{interested}} in his fate. On the other hand, he was, by temperament, economical of the truth. [...] "Pennycuik," [...] he said, [...] "John Pennycuik." ...|$|E
50|$|In 2006, Schiffer and {{her husband}} were twice spoken to by policemen from the local Suffolk force after a number of {{incidents}} involving their two dogs, an Irish wolfhound and a German shepherd, and local people using the public footpath across the grounds of their Coldham Hall home. These included severely mauling a Jack Russell being walked on the footpath, chasing deer on the estate, intimidating people using the footpath, and biting one of the <b>local</b> <b>postmen.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{songs were}} written for, and feature on vocals, <b>local</b> Horley <b>postman</b> Frank Bell, {{who is also}} {{depicted}} on the single's artwork. They also feature Malice/Easy Cure guitarist Porl Thompson and Magspies keyboardist Matthieu Hartley amongst an extended lineup of friends and family, including Robert's sisters Janet and Margaret and local band the Obtainers.|$|R
5000|$|... 2008 {{marked a}} centenary {{in the history}} of Geevagh. It is {{difficult}} from today's position to realise the distressed state of the parish in 1908. Widespread evictions from the local Keogh estate meant many poor families eked out an existence of sorts on the rough barren slopes of Carran mountain. A campaign of non-payment of rent exposed many families to such a fate, and in an effort to prevent further evictions, the Land League organised demonstrations to prevent delivery of eviction notices by <b>local</b> <b>postmen,</b> which led to several confrontations in January 1908 between a large number of citizens and the police. Court cases ensued against around two dozen locals, some of whom ended up serving hard labour in prison for up to six months. While the court cases and prison terms were ongoing, the local community rallied around the families of the prisoners, making sure their farms were worked and tilled. It was not until summer 1909 that a resolution came with the release of the last prisoners, to much local rejoicing by the parish as a whole. John C. Mc Ternan in his book Olde Sligo (1997) records the 1908 events in detail.|$|R
60|$|Upon the 3rd of June Dr. Lana {{received}} a letter from abroad. In a small village the postmaster is also in a position to be the gossip-master, and Mr. Bankley, of Bishop's Crossing, had many of the secrets of his neighbours in his possession. Of this particular letter he remarked only that it was in a curious envelope, that it was in a man's handwriting, that the postscript was Buenos Ayres, and the stamp of the Argentine Republic. It was the first letter which he had ever known Dr. Lana to have from abroad and this was the reason why his attention was particularly called to it before he handed it to the <b>local</b> <b>postman.</b> It was delivered by the evening delivery of that date.|$|E
6000|$|It was a {{place in}} that time like no other: the garden cut into provinces by a great hedge of beech, and {{overlooked}} by {{the church and the}} terrace of the churchyard, where the tombstones were thick, and after nightfall [...] "spunkies" [...] might be seen to dance, at least by children; flower-plots lying warm in sunshine; laurels and the great yew making elsewhere a pleasing horror of shade; the smell of water rising from all round, with an added tang of paper-mills; the sound of water everywhere, and the sound of mills--the wheel and the dam singing their alternate strain; the birds on every bush and from every corner of the overhanging woods pealing out their notes until the air throbbed with them; {{and in the midst of}} this, the manse. I see it, by the standard of my childish stature, as a great and roomy house. In truth, it was not so large as I supposed, nor yet so convenient, and, standing where it did, it is difficult to suppose that it was healthful. Yet a large family of stalwart sons and tall daughters was housed and reared, and came to man and woman-hood, in that nest of little chambers; so that the face of the earth was peppered with the children of the manse, and letters with outlandish stamps became familiar to the <b>local</b> <b>postman,</b> and the walls of the little chambers brightened with the wonders of the East. The dullest could see this was a house that had a pair of hands in divers foreign places: a well-beloved house--its image fondly dwelt on by many travellers.|$|E

50|$|The {{town was}} {{established}} by William McKenzie in 1889 as the first settlement in {{what was to become}} the Ceduna area. McKenzie nearly single handedly set up the town, clearing mallee scrub by axe, building a general store and becoming the <b>local</b> harbour master, <b>postman,</b> blacksmith, butcher, saddler and Justice of the Peace, employing up to 30 people at any one time.|$|R
50|$|After Leon {{struggles with}} the <b>locals</b> (Mishkin the <b>postman,</b> Slovitch the butcher, and Yenchna the vendor), the action shifts {{to the home of}} Doctor Zubritsky and his wife. We learn that the pair are equally dimwitted {{as the rest of the}} characters. Soon, Leon enters and the pair plays out their unintelligent antics on him. When the Doctor {{mentions}} a curse, Leon discovers that the town's idiocy is no accident, that it is a 200-year curse of stupidity cast on them by Vladimir Yousekevitch after his son killed himself because the first Sophia Zubritsky (not the doctor's daughter, but rather an ancestor with the same name) was forbidden to see Vladimir's son by her father, who found out the boy was illiterate, and made to marry another man. The curse will be broken if Leon is able to educate Sophia. Leon is introduced to the Zubritsky's daughter, Sophia, and is immediately lovestruck. He tries to ask her a few simple questions, but she responds idiotically. Later, Leon talks to the Zubritskys, who tell him that the curse can also be broken if Sophia marries Count Gregor, the last of the Yousekevitch line.|$|R
50|$|The cast {{includes}} {{a number of}} leading British film actors, including Wilfrid Brambell as a <b>local</b> <b>postman,</b> Sid James, Charles Hawtrey and Terry Scott. The TV reporter Fyfe Robertson appears briefly as himself, covering the alleged sightings of the monster.|$|E

In The Brentford Triangle, he is summoned to Earth by <b>local</b> <b>postman</b> Small Dave, but he becomes angered by Dave's attempt to control him and by his misinterpretation of C. Auguste Dupin.|$|E

50|$|Born in Ravenna in 1947, Paolo Roversi's {{interest}} in photography was kindled {{as a teenager}} during a family vacation in Spain in 1964. Back home, {{he set up a}} darkroom in a convenient cellar with another keen amateur, the <b>local</b> <b>postman</b> Battista Minguzzi, and began developing and printing his own black & white work.

50|$|It is {{revealed}} that he left the village because he was regarded as strange and because his father was an eccentric scientist who died in trying a flying suit.

50|$|Until {{the advent}} of modern postal systems around the 18th and 19th centuries, most houses and {{buildings}} were not numbered. Streets may have been named for landmarks, such as a city gate or market, or for the occupations of their inhabitants. In many cities in Asia, most minor streets were never named. This is still the case today in much of Japan. A <b>local</b> <b>postman</b> would {{be familiar with the}} area and thus able to deliver mail, but as postal systems developed, it became necessary to number buildings to aid in mail delivery.|$|E
5000|$|The first bronze, for Barclay School, {{was cast}} at the Fiorini Art Bronze Foundry in London, using a lost wax process to cast {{sections}} of the work which were then assembled. The large sculpture tested their facilities, and took nearly a year to complete. It was installed in Stevenage in 1949. Local opinion was not uniformly positive: a <b>local</b> <b>postman</b> {{was quoted as saying}} it resembled something from Belsen. (A similarly unflattering comparison was made to his Reclining Figure: Festival, exhibited at the Festival of Britain in 1951.) ...|$|E

When she learns he did this in an attempt not to burden her, she is annoyed but continues to pursue him. When he refuses to enlist on grounds of being a conscientious objector and is so outed by Joyce Cameron, Spencer is shunned and harassed {{by the people of}} Great Paxford, particularly Miriam Brindsley, until Joyce comes to his defense.

50|$|The Grauballe Man's {{body was}} first {{discovered}} {{buried in the}} bog on 26 April 1952 {{by a team of}} peat diggers. One of the workmen, Tage Busk Sørensen, stuck his spade into something that he knew was not peat; upon revealing more they discovered the head protruding from the ground, and the <b>local</b> <b>postman,</b> who was passing, alerted the local doctor as well as an amateur archaeologist named Ulrik Balslev. With the body still in the peat, various locals came to visit it over the next day, one of whom accidentally stepped on its head. The following morning, Professor Peter Glob from the Prehistory Museum at Aarhus came to visit the body, and arranged for it to be removed to the museum, still encased in a block of surrounding peat.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "castle," [...] {{actually}} a fortified house, {{was built in}} the late 16th century. It provided a refuge in 1690 for James II and his army fleeing the Battle of the Boyne. One explanation for its name is that a ghost or puca inhabited the castle. In June 1867 the daughter of a local Englishman disappeared near the castle. Jane Eleanor Sherrard, daughter of Henry and Margaret Sherrard left her nearby home to pick flowers for the dinner table. When she failed to return home that evening the police were notified and a widespread search was conducted. The last ever confirmed sighting of Jane was by the <b>local</b> <b>postman</b> who reported to have seen her picking flowers {{at the foot of the}} castle's northern wall. To this day the circumstances surrounding her disappearance remain unknown.|$|E
