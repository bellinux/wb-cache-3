The chemical and engineering behaviors of Cochin and Mangalore marine clays are also {{compared with those of}} the smectite-rich Ariake Bay marine clay from Japan. Although Cochin, Mangalore, and Ariake clays contain comparable amounts of smectite (32 - 45 %), Ariake clay exhibits lower consistency limits and much higher ranges of <b>liquidity</b> <b>indices</b> than the Indian marine clays. The lower consistency limits of the Ariake clay are attributed to the absence of well-developed, long-range, interparticle forces associated with the clay. Also, Ariake clay exhibits a significantly large (48 - 714 times) decrease in undrained strength on remolding in comparison to Cochin and Mangalore clays (sensitivity ranges between 1 and 4). A preponderance of long-range, interparticle forces reflected in the high consistency limits of Cochin and Mangalore clays (wL range from 75 to 180 %) combined with low natural water contents yield low <b>liquidity</b> <b>indices</b> (typically < 1) and high, remolded, undrained strengths and are considered to be responsible for the low sensitivity of the Indian marine clays...|$|R

40|$|The correct {{measure and}} {{definition}} of liquidity in finance literature remains an unresolved empirical issue. The main {{objective of the}} present study was to develop, validate and test the <b>liquidity</b> mismatch <b>index</b> (LMI) developed by Brunnermeier, Krishnamurthy and Gorton (2012) empirically. Building on the work of these prior studies, the study undertook to develop a measure of liquidity that integrates both market liquidity and funding liquidity within a context of asset liability management. <b>Liquidity</b> mismatch <b>indices</b> were developed and then tested empirically to validate them by regressing them against the known determinants of liquidity. Furthermore, the study investigated the nexus between liquidity and profitability. The unit of analysis was a panel of 12 South African banks over the period 2005 – 2015. The study developed two liquidity measures – the bank <b>liquidity</b> mismatch <b>index</b> (BLMI) and the aggregate <b>liquidity</b> mismatch <b>index</b> (ALMI) – whose performances were compared to and contrasted with the Basel III liquidity measures and traditional liquidity measures using a generalised method of moments (GMM) model. Overall, the two constructed <b>liquidity</b> <b>indices</b> performed better than other liquidity measures. Significantly, the ALMI provided a better macro-prudential liquidity measure that can be utilised in dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, thus presenting a major contribution to the body of knowledge. Unlike the LMI, the BLMI and ALMI can be used to evaluate the liquidity of a given bank under liquidity stress events, which are scaled by theoretically motivated and empirically supported liquidity weights. The constructed BLMI contains information regarding the liquidity risk within the context of asset liability mismatches, and the measure used comprehensive data from bank balance sheets and from financial market measures. The newly developed liquidity measures are based on portfolio management theory as they account for the significance of liquidity spirals. Empirical results show that banks increase their liquidity buffers during times of turmoil as both BLMI and ALMI improved during the period 2007 – 2009. Subsequently, the improvement in economic performance resulted in a rise in ALMI but a decrease in BLMI. We found no evidence to support the theory that banks, which heavily depend on external funding, end up in serious liquidity problems. The findings imply that any policy implemented with the intention of increasing bank capital is good for bank liquidity since the financial fragility–crowding-out hypothesis is outweighed by the risk absorption hypothesis because the relationship between capital and bank liquidity is positive.

Computational and numerical models are currently being developed to model sensitive clay slides in three dimensions, and aim to integrate geotechnical design calculations with in-situ and laboratory geotechnical data. These models rely on accurate input parameters for analysis, and therefore, the flow behaviour of sensitive clays is required. Previous studies have applied the Herschel-Bulkley rheological model to Canadian and Norwegian clays in order to investigate their flow behaviour. Expanding on past studies, the flow behaviour of fine-grained soils has been investigated in this thesis. This was achieved by conducting quickness tests and viscometric experiments on quick clay samples from Tiller, Norway and Perniö, Finland. An artificial clayey silt and silt were also produced and tested. The Herschel-Bulkley model was used to find rheological parameters, which have been verified by past results. A total of 35 quickness tests and 24 viscometer tests were performed on fine-grained soils. The viscometer tests were done using a coaxial cylinder viscometer in a temperature controlled environment of 7 oC to replicate ground temperature. The salinity and <b>liquidity</b> <b>index</b> were varied to study how these parameters influence a soils rheological properties. The fine-grained soils tested show a shear thinning behaviour when subjected to shear. The rheological parameters show a dependency on <b>liquidity</b> <b>index</b> and salinity. An increase in <b>liquidity</b> <b>index</b> gives a decrease in yield stress and consistency parameter, and an increase in Herschel-Bulkley exponent. An increase in salinity results in the opposite effect. Relationships between the Herschel-Bulkley parameters and <b>liquidity</b> <b>index</b> are found for the Tiller clay, Perniö clay as well as the clayey silt. These are valid for salinity in the range of 1. 56 - 2. 30 g/L and <b>liquidity</b> <b>index</b> 1. 74 - 5. 31. Quickness and viscometer tests can not be conducted accurately on silt soils due to high levels of segregation. The set of Herschel-Bulkley parameters found for a flow curve are not unique. Large variations in the consistency parameter and Herschel-Bulkley exponent are observed for minor variations in yield stress. The Herschel-Bulkley yield stress, however, is a good approximation of a soil's real yield stress. This study has verified the proposed limits between quickness and remoulded shear strength.

The unconfined compression test (UCT) is widely used in laboratory to measure this parameter due to its simplicity; however, it is severely affected by sample disturbance. The vane shear test (VST) technique that is less sensitive to sample disturbance involves a correction factor against the soil plasticity, commonly known as the Bjerrum's correction factor, μ. This study aims to reevaluate the Bjerrum's correction factor in consideration of a different approach and a relatively new method of testing.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Soils at {{critical}} state {{are like a}} visco-plastic fluids, which will flow for applied stresses greater than the {{critical state}} (CS) shear strength. Shear viscosity is a key parameter to understand the post-failure flow response of soils in geotechnical applications such as landslides, jacked piles and cone penetrometers. Viscosity of soil has been investigated for water contents greater than the liquid limit because at these water contents standard viscometers can be used. However, soils can reach CS for water contents in the plastic range and thereafter exhibit viscous behavior without further changes in water contents. There is no standard method to determine shear viscosity of clays at water contents lower that the liquid limit. A new analytical method is proposed to determine the viscous drag (force) on the penetrating cone in a fall cone test. Based on this analysis, {{it is possible to}} interpret the shear viscosity of clays with water contents less than the liquid limit from a penetration test. Time-penetration data from a fall cone test was used to determine the shear viscosity of clays with <b>liquidity</b> <b>index</b> less than 1. 5.

40|$|In the Tauranga region {{sensitive}} soil failures commonly occur after {{heavy rainfall}} events, causing considerable infrastructure damage. Several notable landslides include a large failure at Bramley Drive, Omokoroa in 1979, the Ruahihi Canal collapse in 1981, and numerous landslides in May 2005; recently the Bramley Drive scarp was reactivated in 2011. These failures {{are associated with}} materials loosely classified as the Pahoia Tephras - a mixture of rhyolitic pyroclastic deposits of approximately 1 Ma. The common link with extreme rainfall events suggests a pore water pressure control on the initiation of these failures. Recent research {{on the structure of}} the soils shows a dominance of halloysite clay minerals packed loosely in arrangements with high porosity (51 – 77 %), but with almost entirely micropores. This leads us to conclude that the permeability is very low, and the materials remain continuously wet. The formation of halloysite is encouraged by a wet environment with no episodes of drying, supporting this assumption. A high-resolution CPT trace at Bramley Drive indicates induced pore water pressures rising steadily to a peak at approximately 25 m depth; this depth coincides with the base of the landslide scarp. We infer that elevated pore water pressures develop within this single, thick aquifer, triggering failure through reduced effective stresses. The inactive halloysite clay mineral results in low plasticity indices (13 – 44 %) and hence high <b>liquidity</b> <b>indices</b> (1. 2 – 2. 4) due to the saturated pore space; remoulding following failure is sudden and dramatic and results in large debris runout distances...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{sensitivity}} {{has previously}} been recognised as a significant contributor to soil failures both internationally and within New Zealand, particularly in the Tauranga region. Sensitive soils are characterised by initial high peak shear strength, yet very low remoulded shear strength. While international sensitive soils have been well characterised, the nature of sensitivity in rhyolitic deposits in New Zealand is poorly understood. This study characterises both sensitive and non-sensitive rhyolitic tephra derived soil samples from the Tauranga region {{in order to identify}} the fundamental differences in the materials between states of peak and remoulded strength. Field and laboratory investigations were undertaken to analyse sensitivity. Field investigations included shear vane testing for the quantification of sensitivity, and stratigraphic profiling. Laboratory testing comprised geotechnical testing (particularly shear strength and Atterberg limits), petrographic observations through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), and measurement of the rheology of remoulded sensitive materials. Five localities were used in this study. Three sites were considered sensitive (Omokoroa, Te Puna and Pahoia Peninsula), while the remaining two (Rangataua Bay and Tauriko) were considered non-sensitive {{on the basis of the}} Milne et al. (Milne, J. D. G.; Clayden, B.; Singleton, P. L.; Wilson, A. D. 1995 : Soil description handbook. Manaaki Whenua Press, Lincoln, Canterbury) sensitivity test. Field observations showed sensitive material is of tephric origin, likely associated with the Te Puna Ignimbrite (~ 0. 93 Ma). The deposits considered generally classify as sensitive to extra sensitive (7 - 15) with no samples being identified as quick. The non-sensitive material has characteristically different field behaviour where the material does not release moisture, or flow, upon remoulding. The non-sensitive material is associated with the Te Ranga Ignimbrite (~ 0. 27 Ma). Moisture contents are typically high for the sensitive materials, always exceeding their respective liquid limits (<b>liquidity</b> <b>indices</b> > 1), while the opposite is true for the non-sensitive samples. Porosity is also high for the sensitive materials (> 61 %), whereas non-sensitive materials return lower porosity values of 1. The primary microstructure is matrix-skeletal for sensitive samples. The non-sensitive samples are comprised of large spheres and long, thin tubular halloysite morphologies. These particles pack much more efficiently, where the tubes fill the voids produced between large spherical formations. The result is a much tighter structural arrangement in the clay fraction, with reduced potential for high moisture contents to build up, leading to <b>liquidity</b> <b>indices</b> < 1. The non-sensitive material typically displays a matrix microstructure. Upon remoulding, the structure of the sensitive material was broken down and appeared continuous. Connectors were typically destroyed, while tubes, plates and books were broken into smaller remnants. The similar sized spherical and tubular particles appeared to be easily mobilised following disturbance where they would fail in a fluidised manner from the high moisture held within the sample. The non-sensitive material, however, indicated very little change upon remoulding. The clay particle interactions were still arranged in a tight structure, which did not breakdown sufficiently to become entrained within the available moisture. The sensitivity of rhyolitic tephra, therefore, is primarily attributed to the relative size and packing of the halloysite particle morphologies. The low density of packing produced an open structure, allowing for high moisture contents to develop, which following remoulding, leads to irreversible structural breakdown and release of stored water, promoting flow characteristics of the soil and thus high sensitivity...|$|R
