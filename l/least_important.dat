5|$|In Aland's Profile, Kurt and Barbara Aland {{placed the}} codex's Gospels in Category III, meaning it has {{historical}} importance, with {{the profile of}} 1191, 802, 601/2, 69s. This means {{the text of the}} codex agrees with the Byzantine standard text 119 times, with the original text against the Byzantine 80 times, and with both the Byzantine and original text 60 times. There are 69 independent or distinctive readings in the Gospels. While the Gospels are a representative of the Caesarean text-type, the remainder of the books of the New Testament in this codex is a representative of the Byzantine text-type and falls into Category V, the lowest and <b>least</b> <b>important</b> in Aland's Profile.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{studies for}} large destroyers capable of {{defending}} the French battleline against attacks by enemy destroyers and torpedo boats by the Naval General Staff (NGS) began before World War I, but were suspended {{when the war}} began. They resumed in 1917, but serious planning did not begin until after the war when the NGS decided to split {{the role of the}} destroyer in 1919. The smaller torpilleur d'escadre would have the role of attacking the enemy's battleline with torpedoes and defending that of the French from enemy torpedo craft. The primary role of the larger contre-torpilleur was scouting; defending the battleline was secondary and attacking the enemy battleline <b>least</b> <b>important.</b> This required high speed in all weather, good endurance and a powerful armament capable of engaging small cruisers.|$|E

5|$|The {{title is}} known for its intense difficulty, which {{contributes}} to its reputation as a black sheep in the franchise. Reviewers viewed The Lost Levels {{as an extension of the}} original release, especially its difficulty progression. Journalists appreciated the game's challenge when spectating speedruns, and recognized the game as a precursor to the franchise's subculture in which fans create and share nearly impossible levels. This sequel gave Luigi his first character traits and introduced the poison mushroom item, which would be used throughout the Mario franchise. The Lost Levels was the most popular game on the Disk System, for which it sold about 2.5 million copies. It is remembered among the most difficult games by Nintendo and in the video game medium, and among the <b>least</b> <b>important</b> games in the Mario series.|$|E

25|$|Already in {{the late}} Middle Ages, some {{distinction}} had been occasionally made between on one hand 'rälssi', tax exemption; {{and on the other}} hand a proper ennoblement. It was part of the custom that only kings were entitled to dub knights and ennoble, while in addition several other authorities, including at <b>least</b> <b>important</b> castellans of big castle fiefs, were able to grant tax exemption ('rälssi') to landholdings and useful local gentrymen. Only the increasing precision (and greed for tax revenues) of the Vasa kings brought implications of these differences afront in 16th century and particularly then in 17th century when the House of Knoghts and Nobility had been established.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese regime {{perceived}} Java as {{the most}} politically sophisticated but economically the <b>least</b> <b>important</b> area; its people were Japan's main resource. As such—and in contrast to Dutch suppression—the Japanese encouraged Indonesian nationalism in Java and thus increased its political sophistication (similar encouragement of nationalism in strategic resource-rich Sumatra came later, but only after it was clear the Japanese would lose the war). The outer islands under naval control, however, were regarded as politically backward but economically vital for the Japanese war effort, and these regions were governed the most oppressively of all. These experiences and subsequent differences in nationalistic politicisation would have profound impacts on {{the course of the}} Indonesian Revolution in the years immediately following independence (1945–1950).|$|E

Nantes and St Nazaire, the most important ports, were covered by 1 Squadron, 73 Squadron and 242 Squadron, with a small detachment covering Brest. St Malo and Cherbourg were protected by 17 Squadron and 501 Squadron from the aerodrome at Dinard across the bay from St Malo, then later from the Channel Islands. Fighter Command squadrons from RAF Tangmere were also available for Cherbourg and Coastal Command prepared to escort returning ships. Once the arrangements were made, Barrett left for England and the Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO), Air Vice-Marshal Douglas Evill took over.|$|E

The employers contributed one third, and the workers contributed two thirds. The minimum payments for medical treatment and sick pay for up to 13 weeks were legally fixed. The individual local health bureaus were administered by a committee elected {{by the members of}} each bureau, and this move had the unintended effect of establishing a majority representation for the workers on account of their large financial contribution. This worked to the advantage of the Social Democrats who, through heavy worker membership, achieved their first small foothold in public administration.|$|E
25|$|Acceleration {{increased}} during S-IC flight {{for three}} reasons. One, increased acceleration increased the propellant pressure at the engines, increasing the flow rate somewhat. This was the <b>least</b> <b>important</b> factor, though this feedback effect often {{led to an}} undesirable thrust oscillation called pogo. Two, as it climbed into thinner air F-1 engine efficiency increased significantly, a property of all rockets. The combined thrust of five engines on the pad was about 7.5 million pounds, reaching nearly 9 million pounds at altitude. But the biggest contribution by far was the rocket's rapidly decreasing mass. The propellant in just the S-IC made up about three-quarters of Saturn V's entire launch mass, and it was furiously consumed at over 13 metric tonnes per second. Newton's second law states that force is equal to mass times acceleration, or equivalently that acceleration is equal to force divided by mass, so as the mass decreased (and the force increased somewhat), acceleration rose. Including gravity, launch acceleration was only 1¼g, i.e., the astronauts felt 1¼g while the rocket accelerated vertically at ¼g. As the rocket rapidly lost mass, total acceleration including gravity increased to nearly 4g at T+135 seconds. At this point, the inboard (center) engine was shut down to prevent acceleration from increasing beyond 4g.|$|E

25|$|His victory odes {{are grouped}} into four books {{named after the}} Olympian, Pythian, Isthmian, and Nemean GamesPanhellenic festivals held {{respectively}} at Olympia, Delphi, Corinth and Nemea. This {{reflects the fact that}} most of the odes were composed in honour of boys, youths, and men who had recently enjoyed victories in athletic (and sometimes musical) contests at those festivals. In a few odes however much older victories, and even victories in lesser games, are celebrated, often as a pretext for addressing other issues or achievements. For example, Pythian 3, composed in honour of Hieron of Syracuse, briefly mentions a victory he had once enjoyed at the Pythian Games, but it is actually intended to console him for his chronic illness (similarly, Pythian 2 is like a private letter in its intimacy). Nemean 9 and Nemean 10 celebrate victories in games at Sicyon and Argos, and Nemean 11 celebrates a victory in a municipal election on Tenedos (though it also mentions some obscure athletic victories). These three odes are the final odes in the Nemean book of odes, and there is a reason for their inclusion. In the original manuscripts, the four books of odes were arranged in the order of importance assigned to the festivals, with the Nemean festival, considered <b>least</b> <b>important,</b> coming last. Victory odes that lacked a Panhellenic subject were then bundled together at the end of the book of Nemean odes.|$|E
