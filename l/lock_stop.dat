40|$|Graphics {{processors}} (GPUs) {{are emerging}} as a promising platform for highly parallel, compute-intensive, general-purpose computations, which usually need support for inter-process synchronization. Using the traditional lock-based synchronization (e. g. mutual exclusion) makes the computation vulnerable to faults caused by both scientists’ inexperience and hardware transient errors. It is notoriously difficult for scientists to deal with deadlocks when their computation needs to lock many objects concurrently. Hardware transient errors may make a process, which is holding a <b>lock,</b> <b>stop</b> progressing (or crash). While such hardware transient errors are a non-issue for graphics processors used by graphics computation (e. g. an error in a single pixel may not be noticeable), this no longer holds for graphics processors used for scientific computation. Such scientific computation requires a fault-tolerant synchronization mechanism. However, most of the powerful GPUs aimed at high-performance computing (e. g. NVIDIA Tesla series) do not support any strong synchronization primitives like test-andset and compare-and-swap, which are usually used to construct fault-tolerant synchronization mechanisms. This paper presents an experimental study of fault-tolerant synchronization mechanisms for NVIDIA’s Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) without the need of strong synchronization primitives in hardware. We implement a lockfree synchronization mechanism that eliminates lock-related problems like the deadlock and, moreover, can tolerate process crash-failure. We address the experimental issues that arise {{in the implementation of}} the mechanism and evaluate its performance on commodity NVIDIA GeForce 8800 graphics cards...|$|E

50|$|A control lock, guard <b>lock</b> or <b>stop</b> <b>lock</b> {{differs from}} a normal canal lock in that its primary purpose is {{controlling}} variances in water level rather than raising or lowering vessels. A control lock {{may also be}} known as a tide lock where it is used to control seawater entering into a body of fresh water.|$|R
50|$|When {{the canal}} was opened, {{there was also}} a <b>stop</b> <b>lock</b> at Marple Junction where it joined the Peak Forest Canal, but this <b>stop</b> <b>lock</b> has long since been degated, and only a narrow section with remains of the A-frames betrays its former existence.|$|R

50|$|Where a large height {{difference}} {{has to be}} overcome, locks are built close together in a flight such as at Caen Hill Locks. Where the gradient is very steep, a set of staircase locks are sometimes used, like Bingley Five Rise Locks. At the other extreme <b>stop</b> <b>locks</b> {{have little or no}} change in level but were built to conserve water where one canal joined another. An interesting example is King's Norton <b>Stop</b> <b>Lock</b> which was built with guillotine gates.|$|R
25|$|When {{variable}} conditions {{meant that}} a higher water {{level in the}} new canal could not be guaranteed, then the older company would also build a <b>stop</b> <b>lock</b> (under its own control, with gates pointing towards its own canal) which could be closed when the new canal was low. This resulted in a sequential pair of locks, with gates pointing in opposite directions: one example was at Hall Green near Kidsgrove, where the southern terminus of the Macclesfield Canal joined the Hall Green Branch of the earlier Trent and Mersey Canal. The four gate <b>stop</b> <b>lock</b> near Kings Norton Junction, between the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal and the Worcester and Birmingham Canal was replaced in 1914 {{by a pair of}} guillotine <b>lock</b> gates which <b>stopped</b> the water flow regardless of which canal was higher. These gates have been permanently open since nationalisation.|$|R

50|$|Guillotine locks are {{relatively}} uncommon, {{but many are}} found on the waterways of East Anglia. The advantages over the more traditional design are that the lock occupies less space, does not require room to swing open, and is quicker to fabricate and install. It also acts as a tidal lock, able to hold back water whichever side is higher, and can function as a <b>stop</b> <b>lock</b> (for example, Lifford Lane <b>stop</b> <b>lock</b> near Kings Norton Junction). It is mechanically more complex, however, requiring {{the use of a}} gantry and overhead lifting gear.|$|R
50|$|The longest {{canal pound}} in the United Kingdom {{is between the}} <b>stop</b> <b>lock</b> on the Trent and Mersey Canal at Preston Brook (Dutton <b>Stop</b> <b>Lock</b> No 76) {{and the start of}} the Leeds and Liverpool Canal near Leigh (Poolstock Bottom Lock No 2), a {{distance}} of 39.5 mi. Another long pound is on the Kennet and Avon Canal between Wootton Rivers Bottom Lock and Caen Hill top lock. The longest level on the Erie Canal in New York was the 60 mile level (actually 64.2 miles) between Henrietta and Lockport.|$|R

2500|$|Many <b>stop</b> <b>locks</b> {{were removed}} or {{converted}} to a single gate after nationalisation in 1948. Hall Green <b>stop</b> <b>lock</b> remains, but as a single lock: the extra lock was removed because the lowering of the T's summit pound (to improve Harecastle Tunnel's [...] "air draught" [...] – its free height above the water level) meant that the T would always be lower than the Macclesfield.

A very short section of the Shrewsbury Canal remains, up to the dry dock, which is used as private moorings by the boatyard.|$|R

Here the <b>stop</b> <b>lock</b> consists of two opposing lock gates at each end of a lock so that a boat could be transferred from one canal to the other with a minuscule amount of water loss, and no water flow, no matter which canal happened to be the higher at any particular time. Today the gates are chained open as both canals are under common control.|$|R
