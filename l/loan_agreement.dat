5|$|Defender Keith Lowe, of Cheltenham, and goalkeeper Nick Pope, of Charlton Athletic, {{were signed}} on loan until January 2014. They both played in York's first league defeat in four weeks, 2–1 away, to Southend United. Kevan Hurst gave Southend the lead early into the match and Bowman {{equalised}} for York {{with a low}} strike during the second half, before Luke Prosser scored the winning goal for the home team in stoppage time. With Pope preferred in goal, Kettings returned to Blackpool on his own accord, although his <b>loan</b> <b>agreement</b> would stay in place until January 2014. York then drew 0–0 away to Morecambe. After Pope was recalled from his loan by Charlton, York signed Wolverhampton Wanderers goalkeeper Aaron McCarey on loan until January 2014.

5|$|Following his loan spell at Fulham, Holtby {{returned}} to Tottenham {{and by the}} end of August 2014 had made three appearances, included in which were two in the Europa League. However, having struggled to make an impact at White Hart Lane with Spurs, and after the club signed Benjamin Stambouli from Montpellier, Holtby elected to return to Germany to join Hamburg on loan the following month. In terms of the <b>loan</b> <b>agreement,</b> Hamburg retained the option to purchase Holtby outright for a fee of ₤6.5 million. Despite breaking his collarbone during the Rückrunde, Holtby made 22 Bundesliga appearances in his debut season for Hamburg and started in both legs of the club's relegation playoff victory over Karlsruher SC.|$|E
5|$|Having not {{featured}} for Cardiff {{during the}} opening months of the 2010–11 season, Comminges joined League One side Carlisle United on a short-term loan deal until 31 December 2010. Carlisle manager Greg Abbott hinted {{at the possibility of}} a permanent deal, should the loan be a success. However, Comminges failed to make a league appearance during his three-month loan spell, playing just 45 minutes in a 3–2 win over Conference National side Tamworth in the FA Cup. The adverse weather conditions during his <b>loan</b> <b>agreement</b> had resulted in a spate of postponements, and Comminges returned to his parent club earlier than agreed. On returning to Cardiff, he was told he was free to find a new club with his contract expiring {{at the end of the}} season. He left the club by mutual consent, and subsequently joined League Two side Southend United on a free transfer in January 2011.|$|E

5|$|On 1 March, Jesé {{returned}} to the Santiago Bernabéu {{for the first time}} ahead of Las Palmas' La Liga encounter with Real Madrid. During the build-up to the match, he revealed that he owed a debt to Real Madrid for welcoming him at the club and blamed the cruciate ligament injury he suffered as the reason for him not becoming a star with them. He also defended his previous criticism of former manager José Mourinho, stating that he has no regrets over his actions. Jesé started in the match between the two sides which ultimately ended in a 3–3 draw. He scored his first goals for the club four days later, netting a brace in a 5−2 league win over Osasuna. The result was Jesé's first win with Las Palmas, after the club failed to record a victory in its previous five matches following his arrival. He ultimately made 16 appearances for the campaign, scoring three goals and registering an assist as the side dropped to end the season in fourteenth position. Upon the conclusion of Jesé's <b>loan</b> <b>agreement,</b> Las Palmas elected not to attempt to sign him permanently, with his poor overall performance, high salary demands and off-field behaviour ultimately contributing to the club's decision.|$|E

The amount initially borrowed from Dairy Holdings Limited is $NZ1.7 million out of a maximum of $4.8 million.
