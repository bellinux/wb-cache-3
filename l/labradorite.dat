Originally {{it was a}} temporary wooden structure, topped by a pyramid, with two wings (for entry and exit). In 1930 it was replaced with the present building, built of stone. The combination of dark red and black <b>labradorite</b> enhanced its slender, precise construction.|$|E
25|$|When {{the library}} opened in 1963, the mural {{had not been}} yet installed. American artist Millard Sheets was {{commissioned}} to create a work large {{enough to cover the}} entire side of the library facing Notre Dame's football stadium. Fr. Theodore Hesburgh suggested that the theme should be saints and scholars through the ages. The artwork cost $200,000 and was donated by Mr. and Mrs. Howard V. Phalin of Winnetka, Illinois. Installation took place in the spring of 1964; the dedication ceremony was held on May 7, 1964. The mural is composed of 324 panels. Its creation employed 81 different stones from 16 countries in 171 finishes that included 46 granites and syenites, 10 gabros and <b>labradorites,</b> 4 metamorphic gneisses, 12 serpentines, 4 crystalline marbles, and 5 limestones.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Cenozoic basalts {{from the}} Linqu County, Shandong Province, China entrain some clinopy-roxene crystals, of which many contain {{abundant}} glass melt inclusions. These melt inclusions are ex-tremely irregular in shape with most grain sizes {{in a range}} of 10 － 50 μm and coexist with low-Mg # olivines, <b>labradorites</b> and Ca-rich potassium feldspars. In-situ major and trace element analyses show that the glass melt inclusions are high in alkalis (Na 2 O+K 2 O> 10 wt%), SiO 2 (> 54 wt%), CaO and FeO (> 4 wt%), but low in MgO (Mg # 2), thus having phonoli-tic compositions. The compositional features of cli-nopyroxene crystals, glass melt inclusions and their coexistent minerals suggest that these melt inclu-sions were exotic melts in clinopyroxenes trapped prior to their entrainment in the host basalt. The dis-covery of these melt inclusions provides a new ap-proach to further investigating the evolution of Meso-zoic lithospheric mantle beneath the southeastern North China Craton...|$|R
40|$|A subsolidus temperature-composition diagram for the calcic {{portion of}} the system NaAlSilOrCaAl 2 Si 2 Os {{is derived from the}} {{following}} data: (a) compositions of plagioclase crystallized under a range of metamorphic conditions; (b) TEM observations of coexisting andesine (An 3 e) and bytownite (Anes); and (c) TEM and crystallographic studies of calcic plagioclase from the literature. The most significant feature of the diagram is a proposed existence of two tricritical points and their associated conditional spinodals. One tricritical point is a consequence of the Cl e n transition, which is inferred, from microstructures of plutonic plagioclase, to occur near An 73 -An 75 at- 900 "C. The other tricritical point is a consequence of the /l = Pl transition and is inferred to be located near An 75 -An 7 s at- 675 "C. The Cl P /l conditional spinodal is responsible for submicroscopic tw-o-phase intergrowths in <b>labradorites</b> and for Bdggild intergrowths (Anqs-Anes). The 1 l a Pl conditional spinodal is responsible for Huttenlocher intergrowths (Anoo-Ans 7). At tempera-tures between- 400 " and- 575 'C, plagioclase in the range of bulk composition Ana 6 Ane 6 should produce an equilibrium oligoclase/andesine f bytownite assemblage by nucleation and growth. Intermediate compositions are interpreted {{to be the result of}} metastable plagioclase growth and/or decomposition to submicroscopic intergrowths within either of the two conditional spinodals. Even the long equilibration times associated with regional metamorphism fail to produce equilibrium plagioclase feldspar compositions...|$|R
25|$|Ammolite {{is neither}} easily nor often imitated; however, a few {{materials}} have a passing resemblance that may deceive the unfamiliar. These include: <b>labradorite</b> (also known as spectrolite), an iridescent feldspar that {{may also be}} of Canadian origin; and broad-flash black opal. Neither are convincing substitutes, and the latter is actually of greater value than ammolite. Indeed, ammolite is often used as an imitation of black opal. An even less convincing possibility is Slocum stone, a common glass-based imitation of opal. Blues and purples are much more pervasive in <b>labradorite,</b> and in both it and opal the play of color is seen to roll across the stone unlike the comparatively restricted play of color in ammolite. In Slocum stone, the play of color {{takes the form of}} tinsel-like patches. The visible structure is also considerably different; in the imitations, the body of the stone is transparent to translucent from certain angles, whereas ammolite is entirely opaque.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} composition may vary between end member species {{of a solid}} solution series. For example, the plagioclase feldspars comprise a continuous series from sodium-rich end member albite (NaAlSi3O8) to calcium-rich anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8) with four recognized intermediate varieties between them (given in order from sodium- to calcium-rich): oligoclase, andesine, <b>labradorite,</b> and bytownite. Other examples of series include the olivine series of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite, and the wolframite series of manganese-rich hübnerite and iron-rich ferberite.|$|E
2500|$|Helmet Peak on the {{northern}} end of Lake Island just off the southwestern side of the Don Peninsula is a steep-sided monogenetic cinder cone. It is composed of welded volcanic blocks and basaltic feeder dikes. With an elevation of , Helmet Peak is the highest volcano in the Milbanke Sound Group. During its eruption, basaltic tuff breccia was sent throughout the surrounding landscape that deposited on glaciated granitic rock and unconsolidated beach gravel near the volcano. This basaltic tuff breccia covers parts of Lake Island and nearby Lady Douglas Island. Blocks of basement granodiorite, some up to [...] wide, are randomly suspended within the breccia. Basalt on Lake Island is characterized by abundant [...] to [...] <b>labradorite</b> and clinopyroxene phenocrysts.|$|E
40|$|Electron {{microprobe}} {{data are}} presented for clinopyroxenes, plagioclases, palagonites, smectites, celadonites, and zeolites in Hole 462 A sheet-flow basalts and Site 585 volcaniclastic sediments. Glomerocrystic clinopyroxenes in Hole 462 A are predominantly Ti-poor augites with minor fractionation to ferroaugites in rim portions. Quenched plumose clinopyroxenes show considerable variation from Ca-rich to Ca-poor augites, although all {{are characterized by}} being Tirich and Cr-poor relative to the glomerocrysts. Two differentiated series of Site 585 pyroxene compositions, calcic augite and diopside-salite, demonstrate the coexistence, in the vitric and lithic clasts, of tholeiitic and alkali basalt types, respectively. Plagioclase compositions in all samples are mainly <b>labradorites,</b> although some zoned Hole 462 A glomerocrysts range from An 73 to An 20 and are characterized by high Mg and Fe contents in the more calcic varieties. The K content of the plagioclases is highest in the more sodic crystals, although the overall higher orthoclase component of Site 585 plagioclases reflects the generally higher bulk-rock K content. The compositions of both secondary smectites and celadonites are similar irrespective of the alteration location (glass, matrix, vesicles, etc.), although brown smectites replacing interstitial glass have marginally higher total Fe contents than pale green and yellow smectites. Analyzed zeolites are mainly phillipsites with variable alkali content, and, together with associated celadonite, represent late-stage alteration repositories for K under mildly oxidizing conditions. The compositions of both early and late secondary minerals are typical of those formed by the submarine alteration of basaltic rocks at low temperatures...|$|R

[...] Spectrolite was initially a brand name for material mined in Finland, but is sometimes incorrectly used to describe <b>labradorite</b> whenever a richer display of colors is present, regardless of locality: for example, <b>labradorite</b> with the spectrolite play of colors has also reported from Madagascar. The difference between Finnish spectrolite and other labradorites is that crystals of the former have considerably stronger colourfulness than other labradorites, caused by the black base color of spectrolite feldspar; other labradorites have mostly a transparent base color.
