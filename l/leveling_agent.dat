40|$|Atmospheric-pressure plasma {{treatment}} of wool fabric produced {{a significantly higher}} level of adsorbed fiber-reactive dye when applied at 50 °C (pH 3. 0 – 6. 0) {{in the absence of}} any organic <b>leveling</b> <b>agent.</b> In addition, color yields indicated that dye was more uniformly adsorbed by the plasma-treated fabric compared with the untreated material. When untreated fabric was dyed in the presence of a <b>leveling</b> <b>agent</b> (Albegal B), the extent and levelness of dye sorption were enhanced. These enhancements were, however, relatively small on the plasma-treated wool compared with those on untreated wool. A ‘surface’ mechanism, similar to that proposed when plasma-treated wool is dyed in the absence of <b>leveling</b> <b>agent,</b> can explain the leveling ability of Albegal B under adsorption conditions. Increasing the dyebath temperature to 90 °C resulted in dye penetration of the fibers. Under these conditions, any enhancements of dye uptake produced by the {{plasma treatment}}, as well as the use of Albegal B, were relatively small, in contrast to the behavior at 50 °C. Improvements in the uniformity of dye sorption observed at 50 °C were, however, maintained at the higher temperature. It is concluded that the inability of reactive dyes to migrate (and so promote leveling and uniformity) once they have reacted with the fiber, means that differences in the uniformity of dye sorbed at 50 °C are still apparent at equilibrium. <br /...|$|E

When one considers that dyebath effluents contain a complex mixture of dyes, dispersing <b>agents,</b> <b>leveling</b> <b>agents,</b> wetting agents and trace metals (2 - 51, it becomes obvious that every effort must be made to minimize the amount of waste released into the environment.

The results showed that the treatment removed at least 98 % of the original color but not all the dye auxiliaries/ dyebath assistants. Of the dispersing agents, the naphthalene sulphonate was more difficult to remove than the ligninsulphonate.

40|$|Magnetostrictive CoFe {{films were}} {{investigated}} {{for use as}} magnetoelastic tags or sensors. The ability to electrodeposit these films enables batch fabrication processes to pattern a variety of geometries while controlling the film stoichiometry and crystallography. In current research looking at CoFe, improved magnetostriction was achieved using a co-sputtering, annealing, and quenching method 1. Other current research has reported electrodeposited CoFe films using a sulfate based chemistry resulting in film compositions that are Fe rich {{in the range of}} Co 0. 3 - 0. 4 Fe 0. 7 - 0. 6 and have problems of co-deposition of undesirables that can {{have a negative impact on}} magnetic properties 2, 3. The research presented here focused on maximizing magnetostriction at the optimal stoichiometry range of Co 0. 7 - 0. 75 Fe 0. 3 - 0. 25, targeting the (fcc+bcc) /bcc phase boundary, and using a novel chemistry and plating parameters to deposit films without being limited to “line of sight” deposition 1. 	To obtain the desired compositional range, a chemistry was selected to allow for a higher ratio of Co while maintaining stability and limiting the oxidation of the Fe 2 + to Fe 3 +. As suggested by Osaka et al., Fe(OH) 3 is formed and included into the film resulting in a decrease of the saturation magnetic flux density (Bs) value as the Fe cation is oxidized 2. This led to a deviation from the traditional sulfate based chemistry used to deposit CoFe alloy thin films and the inclusion of additives acting as oxygen scavengers to stabilize deposition. 	The characteristics of the deposited films were controlled through the additives, temperature, agitation, concentrations, current density, and duty cycle of the pulsing regime. After initial chemistry characterization to determine the kinetics and mass transfer limitations, samples were plated across a range of current densities and duty cycles onto copper tuning fork substrates that enabled magnetic testing to be performed. The samples were then analyzed with EDS to determine the composition. Magnetic testing was performed using super conducting quantum interference device measurements (SQUID), as well as visual inspection of the displacement on a deposit stress analyzer as a magnetic field was applied to the films. The magnetostriction was then correlated to stoichiometry and the plating parameters to characterize magnetostriction performance. 	Electrochemical studies were conducted to examine the kinetic rate for the reduction of the cobalt iron alloy as a function of additive concentrations. The oxygen scavenger additives were found to increase the kinetics while anodically shifting the reduction peak for the alloy. The <b>leveling</b> and brightening <b>agents</b> shifted the reduction peak cathodically and decreased the standard rate constant. Adjusting the concentration of ascorbic acid minimized the cathodic shift and decrease in the kinetic rate caused by the brightening additives.

40|$|Abstract. When common epoxy {{coatings}} {{were applied}} directly on high temperature (usually about 70 °C) steel surface, some defects would occur in coating film, such as bubbles, pinholes, loosen and poor quality flow leveling property, etc. These defects lead to reduction in coating’s adhesion, physical properties and anti-penetrability, shorten service life of coatings greatly, making coating losing their protection function. Main reasons for those defects were analyzed briefly in this paper.

40|$|AbstractFor the {{fabrication}} of high efficiency solar cells a full electroplated metallization process is beneficial. In this paper light induced plating (LIP) of thin Nickel seed layers and subsequent Silver metallization has been processed. The antireflective coating is opened by laser chemical doping (LCP). The subsequent front contact {{was formed by}} a Nickel/Silver stack deposited by light induced plating. To make electroplating industrial feasible high deposition rates are required. However, high plating rates can influence specific conductivity and uniformity in a negative way. Thus, the line conductivity which is strongly determined by the homogeneity and the morphology of the plated fingers was investigated. To improve these limiting factors the effect of current density and organic additives was investigated in terms of finger resistances and microscope pictures. In order to achieve a good uniformity and conductivity on thin fingers, an organic additive which acts as <b>leveling</b> <b>agent</b> was applied. This leveler inhibits electrodeposition in areas of high electrical field. Therefore, different textures, plating rates and concentrations of leveling agents are compared. Furthermore, different methods for interconnection of electroplated solar cells are discussed. In terms of adhesion, the first results show that bonding of the electroplated busbars is most suitable for interconnection. With bonding, a peel of strength of more than 1, 5 N on the whole area can be achieved. Also, the relative efficiency loss of bonded cells is in an adequate range with 1. 8 %...|$|E
30|$|The {{fundamental}} {{ingredients of}} a UV resist include a UV-curable matrix, a photo-initiator, and other additives such as plasticizer, curing accelerator, photo-sensitizer, flow and <b>leveling</b> <b>agent,</b> fluorinated surfactant, and so on. Acrylate-based resins {{have been widely}} used in various UV-curable material systems as the backbone because of their great reactivity with a wide choice of acrylated monomers and oligomers[12, 13]. However, a significant drawback of acrylated materials is that free radical polymerization is strongly inhibited by oxygen scavenging of the free radicals. This prevents UV-curing imprint process from being operated in ambient air environment, increasing the cost of equipment. To address this issue, materials such as vinyl ethers[14] and epoxides[15] based on cationic polymerization were used for UV-curable nanoimprint resists, which effectively cross-link upon UV exposure in the presence of air. However, vinyl ether resins are costly because of a narrow choice of commercially available monomers and oligomers. The cationic polymerization rate of epoxy groups is low,[16] and the conversion rate is less than 10 % when the temperature is lower than 50 °C[17, 18]. Recently, new epoxy-based materials were developed for imprint resists[19, 20]; the mechanism of the polymerization is not fully revealed. Furthermore, these resists can only be cross-linked by UV light, so a transparent mold or substrate is required. On the other hand, epoxy-based negative photoresist, such as SU- 8, was used for combined UV and thermal NIL, but it required very high imprint pressure (as high as 30 bar) to press the mold into the molten resist[21 – 23].|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{two techniques}} of structuration of type UV-LIGA (Lithographie, Galvanisierung und Abformung) {{based on the}} use of two thick photoresists which are a dry film resist called Riston® from DuPont and the new SU- 8 negative-working resist from IBM. The relating processes to the structuration of these photoresists and some applications are presented too. The minimal resolution of the Riston® films {{has been found to be}} 30 µm for lines and trenches, and 40 µm for isolated holes in a 50 µm-thick film. A technique for the structuration of multilevel superimposed cavities has been set up. The verticality of the sidewalls (85. 5 °deg. to 87. 5 °deg) has been measured on film thicknesses between 25 and 100 µm. The SU- 8 process has been studied and is presented. Some optical and mechanical properties have been analysed. We have determined a coefficient of light attenuation of 5. 18 [db/mm] at 365 nm, a coefficient of thermal expansion of 52 [ppm/°C] and a biaxial modulus of 5. 18 GPa. The verticality of the walls depends on the exposure energy and has been found to be higher than 89 °deg. Layers from 750 nm to 2 mm can be exposed in one time, which seems to be the state-of-the art for a UV-photoresist to our knowledge. A specific process for the electroforming in multi-level superimposed cavities has been developed. With an adequate dosage of a <b>leveling</b> <b>agent</b> (coumarin) in the electrolytic Watt bath of nickel, a change in the growth rate of the high and the low level of the mold has been demonstrated. This rate is harmonised to obtain a flat deposition on the top surface of the formed structure. The UV-LIGA techniques developed in this thesis have found applications in the field of the-micromechanics. A flexible gearwheel, whose teeth are bound to the center via three integrated spring, and a multilevel gear system are the main realizations obtained by electroforming. These two structures have been used in a mechanism with a special watch mechanism and in a microreducer based on an electrostatic rotary micromotor. We have experimented with success the plastic injection of a gear system having 1. 4 mm in height and 3 mm in diameter. Its mold has been electroformed on a master in SU- 8. Theses microparts have demonstrated their functionality and have been mounted in commercialy-available-low-cost watches. All the process step of the LIGA technique have been established. The main advantages of this fabrication method are a better control of the tolerances and an improvement of the rugosity (against the wire electrodischarge machining technology).

40|$|In {{the first}} part of the {{dissertation}} (Chapters 3 - 5), the effect of a cationic dispersant, polyethyleneimine (PEI) on the co-deposition of micro and nano SiC particles with nickel is characterized and modeled. A major challenge in Ni/SiC co-deposition for wear-resistant coatings is that the dispersants that are used to stabilize the particles in the electrolyte to ensure high and uniform particle incorporation into the deposit can significantly affect the electrodeposition kinetics. To overcome this challenge, studies of particle dispersion and electrodeposition are integrated. The effect of PEI on the electrodeposition of Ni/SiC composites is characterized as a function of SiC and PEI bath concentration, current density, rotation speed, molecular weight of PEI and particle size. A pre-coating procedure, in which SiC particles are pre-coated with PEI in a different electrolyte prior to plating, is described. With the pre-coating procedure, high particle stability in the plating bath is obtained. In addition, a significant increase on the SiC incorporation rate is seen without any substantial decrease on the current efficiency for both micro- and nano-composites. Furthermore, using pre-coated particles in the presence of a <b>leveling</b> <b>agent</b> is found to be advantageous relative to the direct addition of PEI into the electrolyte. The efficacy of employing the pre-coating procedure in manufacturing, where plating baths need a long life, is also found to be satisfactory. The use of pre-coated SiC particles changes the morphology, decreases the surface roughness and increases the hardness of the deposits for both particle sizes. Finally, a mathematical model of the co-deposition is proposed. The rate of incorporation is proportional to the residence time, inversely proportional to the burial time, and is proportional to the number density of particles on the surface. These times are influenced by the hydrodynamics, particle size, current density, and concentration of dispersants. SiC incorporation increases with the introduction of PEI due to an increase in the residence time of the particles on the surface. In the second part of the dissertation, a sodium-metal chloride battery, which is another important complex electrochemical system, is studied. A one-dimensional mathematical model of the porous cathode of a sodium-iron chloride battery for an isothermal, constant-current discharge-charge cycle is presented. In sodium-iron chloride batteries, it is desirable to maintain low FeCl 2 solubility to minimize redistribution of active material in the cell. However, the iron chloride is sparingly soluble, and with increased cycling, it does redistribute. None of the previous models can predict this movement of the metal that takes place in the cell with increased cycling that can cause the failure of the cell. An advance offered by the model presented is that it accounts for the change in the solubility of FeCl 2 within the cell and predicts the relocation of the iron by including the flux of a sparingly soluble ferrous complex. For instance, the model predicts that at the end of the fifth cycle, the iron amount decreases by ~ 1 % near the sodium tetrachloroaluminate reservoir...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{environmental}} {{authorities in}} Sweden are reporting about high content of antimony in waste {{water that is}} discharging from polyester textile dyeing industries. It is known from available scientific publications that, antimony and its compound is harmful for both human and environment. While dyeing of polyester textiles have a commercial importance and {{in regards to the}} environmental issues, the industries are looking for the factors those results in high concentrations of antimony in their dyeing waste water. Dyeing of polyester textile requires high-temperature application in association with dyes and process aid chemicals. The waste water that is being produced after dyeing contains a complex mixture of chemicals, where antimony is one of that mixture. To comply with the industries interest, this master thesis work involved the exhaust dyeing of polyester fabrics/yarns and analyzing the dyeing waste water, to determine the amount of antimony diffusion. According to literature studies, the antimony compounds are widely used as catalyst for polyethylene terepthalate (PET) polymerization and hence antimony is present in polyester textiles. The entire experimental work intended to understand the variation of antimony concentration and the factors that are causing high antimony diffusion from polyester textiles during dyeing. The materials which are polyester yarn and fabrics were collected from 3 different dyeing industries of Sweden and the materials were in 9 different types. From material analysis (before dyeing) it has been found there were variations in antimony concentration among the materials. The process parameters that have varied during exhaust dyeing were dyeing temperature, cycle time and process aid chemical (<b>leveling</b> <b>agent)</b> adding options. With the variation in process parameters, the dyeing has performed and the dyeing waste waters have analyzed through inductively coupled plasma sector field mass spectroscopy (ICP-SFMS). The expectations from the experiments were, under specific dyeing process and with same antimony concentration, the materials varying in filament/fiber diameter; big diameter filament/fiber will diffuse less antimony compared to the small diameter filaments. Also, process-wise the antimony diffusion ratio among the materials will accordingly follow the Fick’s diffusion model. To face the environmental issues with sustainability, entire thesis work could provide concentrated knowledge’s with literature evidence for the dyeing industries. As literature study indicates, the dyeing temperature, temperature ramp set and cycle time play major factor while comparing for the expected diffusion ratio. As a gentle process parameter, comparatively lower temperature and cycle time results lower antimony diffusion. The use of levelling agent could be reduced to a level with the appropriateness while added for dyeing. Also, a strong follow-up is needed in the supply chain, for lowering the initial antimony content in the materials. Overall, the findings of this thesis work also keep an importance to do further research on the polyester textile, as during the experiments most of the materials haven’t reacted accordingly as they were expected to react with the Fick’s diffusion model...|$|E
40|$|Electrodeposition {{of copper}} is used {{extensively}} for the fabrication of electrical interconnects in semiconductor device manufacturing and in {{printed circuit board}} production, {{as well as other}} industries. Copper is often plated from an acidic copper sulfate electrolyte with a number of inorganic and organic constituents. Electrolyte enables filling of complex surface geometries with desired internal and surface properties. Continuing miniaturization of modern microelectronics requires a highly controlled electrodeposition process and also requires interconnect materials with improved electromigration and stress migration resistances. Thus, current research deals with two avenues that have a potential to improve the process of copper electroplating and extend copper technology {{to meet the challenges of}} future device dimensions. The improvement in the plating process of copper is being sought by the integration of an iron redox couple (Fe 3 +/Fe 2 +) to copper electrolytes. Certain benefits of incorporating Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + subsystem in combination with inert anode to the electrolyte have been previously recognized, though without regards to the impact that Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + can exert on the behavior of additives. Organic additives are essential constituents of all copper plating baths. Therefore, we studied how the presence of Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + affects organics additives, with focus on two representative components: polyethylene glycol (PEG) and bis(3 -sulfopropyl) -disulfide (SPS). Electrochemical studies on a rotating disk electrode (RDE) and microfluidic device showed that the behavior of PEG during copper deposition is not affected in the presence of Fe 3 + and Fe 2 + ions. Kinetics of adsorption and desorption of PEG on copper electrode were also unaffected. In contrast, the activity of SPS increased when Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + were present in a copper-plating bath. By means of the electrochemical analysis and investigation by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), it was revealed that the Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + redox couple reacts with SPS to form 3 -mercaptopropyl sulfonate (MPS) in the bulk solution. The ratio of Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + determined the reducing power of the electrolyte by changing the concentration of MPS derived from SPS. The estimates of the standard reduction potential of SPS to MPS reduction, based on equilibrium calculation with reference to HPLC results, put the reduction potential in the range between 0. 3 - 0. 4 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). To facilitate the study SPS/MPS equilibrium in the presence of ferrous and ferric ions, a new chromatographic method was developed for the detection of SPS, MPS, monoxide-of-SPS, and dioxide-of-SPS from a copper electrolyte. An HPLC tool was coupled with an electrochemical detector, which enabled concentration sampling in a range of just a few parts per billion (ppb). Due to its low limit of detection and effective separation of detectable compounds, this method can prove crucial for plating bath control, where very little amount of certain byproducts may significantly decrease performance of the electrolyte. As technology advances to create smaller microelectronics, copper interconnects are becoming more prone to failures by electromigration and stress migration effects. Copper can potentially be made less susceptible to these effects if alloyed with about one weight percent of another metal. Accordingly our research examined copper-silver (Cu-Ag) and copper-tin (Cu-Sn) alloys as two possible applications in interconnect technology. The main challenge for depositing silver from copper plating electrolytes, which contain about 50 ppm of chloride, is the low solubility of silver ions with chloride. Together with other additives, chloride is a crucial component promoting defect-free filling of surface features. To overcome this challenge, it was shown that the application of pulse-plating instead of direct current plating enabled the use of chloride at a substantial concentration, while also allowing a wide range of Cu-Ag alloy compositions. Theoretical estimates of alloy compositions were in agreement with experimental values at various pulse frequencies and duty cycles, electrode rotation speeds, and electrolyte concentrations. However, organic additives decreased incorporation of Ag into the alloy due to a possible complexing effect on silver ion. It was also discovered that salt of copper (CuSO 4 * 5 H 2 O) from a number of major chemical suppliers contains Ag as an impurity. Pulsating conditions were responsible for an unwanted increased in surface roughness of the plated film alloys. However, the addition of a <b>leveling</b> <b>agent</b> polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) at 10 ppm of chloride improved roughness and surface quality of the deposited Cu-Ag thin films. Electrodeposits of copper-tin alloy thin films were prepared from acidic copper sulfate electrolytes by polarizing copper deposition into the region where Sn deposition became possible. The ability to polarize copper deposition demonstrated with the use of EPE, poly(ethylene glycol) -block-poly(propylene glycol) -block-poly(ethylene glycol), and bromide in comparison to several other chemistries. Sn content between 0 - 7 at% was obtained above the reduction potential of Sn 2 +. High Sn content of up to 20 at% was achieved when Cu deposition was suppressed below the deposition potential of Sn 2 + by the combination of Br and EPE. A positive correlation between Sn content and concentration of Sn 2 + in the electrolyte was observed. Higher tin content in the alloy was also correlated with low rotation speeds...|$|E
