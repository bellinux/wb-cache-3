25|$|The bank offered {{loans to}} income-producing manor owners (about 70–80% of total loans) or {{property}} owners in cities. Long-term loans were paid not in cash, but in mortgage bonds which provided for a fixed annual interest to their holders. Initially, that interest was 6%. Twice a year, the borrowers {{had to pay}} the interest to mortgage bond holders plus 1% administrative fee to the bank. This fee was lowered several times and in 1900s it was 0.25% for manor owners and 0.5% for city residents. The loans were provided for only up to 60% of the appraised value of the mortgaged real estate. The terms of the long-term loans varied over the years. Initially, the loans for manor owners were offered for 43.5, 48.67, or 54.5 years. More terms were added later, the longest being 66.17 years. The <b>loan</b> <b>terms</b> for city residents were shorter: initially up to 27.5 years and later up to 38.33 years. Most borrowers (more than 80% in 1912–1914) opted for the longest possible loans. Short-term loans, for one to three years, were available only for up to 10% of the appraised real estate value.|$|E

2500|$|Sexual {{discrimination}} {{can arise}} in different contexts. For instance, an employee may be discriminated against by being asked discriminatory questions during a job interview, or by an employer not hiring or promoting, unequally paying, or wrongfully terminating, an employee {{based on their}} gender. [...] Sexual discrimination can also arise when the dominant group holds a bias against the minority group. One such example is Wikipedia. In the Wikipedian community, around 13 percent of registered users are women. This creates gender imbalances, and leaves room for systemic bias. Women are not only more harshly scrutinized, but the representation of women authors are also overlooked. Relative to men, across all source lists, women have a 2.6 greater odds of omission in Wikipedia. In an educational setting, there could be claims that a student was excluded from an educational institution, program, opportunity, loan, student group, or scholarship because of their gender. In the housing setting, there could be claims that a person was refused negotiations on seeking a house, contracting/leasing a house or getting a loan based on their gender. Another setting where there have been claims of gender discrimination is banking; for example if one is refused credit or is offered unequal <b>loan</b> <b>terms</b> based on one's gender. [...] As with other forms of unlawful discrimination, {{there are two types}} of sex discrimination – direct discrimination and indirect discrimination. Direct sex discrimination is fairly easy to spot – 'Barmaid wanted', but indirect sex discrimination, where an unnecessary requirement puts one sex at a disproportionate disadvantage compared to the opposite sex, is sometimes less easy to spot, although some are obvious – 'Bar person wanted – must look good in a mini skirt'. Another setting where there is usually gender discrimination is when one is refused to extend their credit, refused approval of credit/loan process, and if there is a burden of unequal <b>loan</b> <b>terms</b> based on one's gender.|$|E

However, the effect of monopoly power of market concentration on the <b>loan</b> contract <b>terms</b> is adjusted by corporate governance mechanisms. By controlling for both firm-level and country-level governance, firms in competitive industries are found to have favored <b>loan</b> contract <b>terms.</b> Substitution effects between firm-level governance and country-level governance in determining the <b>loan</b> contract <b>terms</b> are also evidenced by our results...|$|R
