40|$|Enantioselective {{addition}} of dialkylzinc to aldehydes {{in the presence}} of a catalytic amount of chiral ligands is known to be one of the most important methods for the synthesis of optically active secondary alcohols. 1 Much efforts have been made to search for efficient chiral ligands in the reaction. 2 Previously we showed the use of chiral amino thioacetate ligands 1 in the enantioselective addition. 3 The ligands induced an efficient addition reaction with high ee's. The successful development of homogeneous ligands has been often followed by attempts to attach them onto an insoluble polymeric support. 4, 5 Immobilized ligands provide several advantages such as simplified workup procedures, easy recovery and reuse in successive reactions. In the case of expensive materials, their regeneration is attractive from an economical viewpoint. Our interest in the area <b>led</b> <b>us</b> <b>t...</b>|$|E
40|$|The idea {{of proving}} identities for {{symmetric}} functions by bijective arguments is quite old; {{it goes back}} to Lucas (Theorie des nombres, 1891) and probably earlier. To the best of our knowledge, the first glimmerings of a systematization of such bijective arguments goes back to one of the present author (cf. 191); the idea was further developed by R. P. Stanley, wo gave a bijective proof of Waring’s formula by Mobius inversion on the lattice of partition of a set, and later by Doubilet, who gaves bijective proofs of several identities in the theory of symmetric functions. Joyal’s theory of species <b>led</b> <b>us</b> <b>t</b> o develop a systematic setting for such bijective proofs. We introduce here the notion of synirnetric species, which {{can be viewed as a}} set-theoretic (a category-theoretic) counterpart of the notion of a symmetric function. To each of the classical classes of symmetric functions we associate a symmetric species. Operations on species, as introduced by Joyal, are generalized to symmetric species, and simple categorical operations yielded bijective proofs of all identities among elementary symmetric functions. By way of example, we give a bijective proof of Waring’s forniula, which we believe to be new, and dispense...|$|E

40|$|We present here {{a survey}} of {{published}} work covering the growth and development of control engineering, leading to modern adaptive methods and finally to intelligent neurocontrol. Ever {{since the advent of}} civilization, man has constantly attempted to replace human effort with machines and control systems. From the early days of steam, hydraulic and pneumatically driven machinery to the modern era of electrical and electronic devices, the level of control achieved over industrial systems has constantly increased. With the availability of fast, high-capacity digital computer equipment, automatic numerically-controlled industrial systems are common today. Well-established methods to model and control plants with linear characteristics and unchanging parameters are already in existence. Nonlinear plants with time-varying internal parameters are more challenging and the so-called `adaptive' methods have been developed to address this issue.

40|$|Trichomoniasis is {{a sexually}} {{transmitted}} disease due to infection with Trichomonas vaginalis, and it can cause serious consequences for women's health. To study the virulence factors of this pathogen, T. vaginalis surface proteins were investigated using polyclonal antibodies specific to the membrane fractions of T. vaginalis. The T. vaginalis expression library was constructed by cloning the cDNA derived from mRNA of T. vaginalis into a phage λ Uni-ZAP XR vector, and then used for immunoscreening with the anti-membrane proteins of T. vaginalis antibodies. The immunoreactive proteins identified included adhesion protein AP 65 - 1, α-actinin, kinesin-associated protein, teneurin, and 2 independent hypothetical proteins. Immunofluorescence assays showed that AP 65 - 1, one of the identified immunogenic clones, is prevalent in the whole body of T. vaginalis.

40|$|The {{important}} question, how {{the global}} network archi-tecture connecting cortical regions keeps balances between integration and segregation of information pro-cesses, {{have been asked}} to understand the design of the brain [1, 2]. This study aimed to clarify how topological characteristics of such global network architecture relate with physiological characteristics inside of segmented cortical regions in the monkey brain [3]. Especially, I focused on cell densities (densities of neurons or non-neurons) as the representative characteristics of segmen-ted cortical regions [4], and compared the cell densities with network topologies of cortico-cortical fiber tracts [Figure 1 -A]. To reduce biases in comparisons, I sur-veyed many topological measures as wide as possible. Total number of evaluated network measures was 27. As the result, surprisingly, only participation coefficient (PCs) showed significant correlations with cell densities [3]. Although a previous study reported that cell densities significantly change on the anterior-posterior coordinate [5], spatial coordinates did not correlate significantly with participation coefficients. Participation coefficient is the topological measure evaluating how often each node (seg-mented brain region) connects to other nodes locating dif-ferent communities (modules). The modules, which detected based on a computational criterion [3], corre-sponded with visual, somatosensory, auditory, and two associative modules [Figure 1 -C]. The associative modules simultaneously showed low neuron density and high parti-cipation coefficient, which means there are diversive con-nections with different modules.

40|$|In the olden days, when an Ethiopian scribe wrote a manuscript, the scribe used be'rina (made up of a goat or a sheep skin) {{to write}} on, a scribe's pen or be're ' (made up of a reed), and ink (made up of {{different}} substances) [l]. After he/she gathered of all necessary materials, {{it was the}} scribe's responsibility to write and typeset a whole manuscript. The number of characters in Ethiopic alphabet was not a critical problem for the scribe although the entire process of writing a manuscript was time consuming and cumbersome. When a modern printing press was established in Ethiopia {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century, new methods of printing books became easy, reliable, and fast. Old manuscripts that had been used in churches and in some other institutions were gradually replaced by newly printed books. Despite numerous technological advances in typesetting and in the printing press, the large number of Ethiopic characters is still a fundamental problem. There are 231 letters in the Ethiopic alphabet excluding special characters, numbers, and punctuation marks. As a result of that, the Ethiopic typewriter is extremely difficult to use compared with the English typewriter. Furthermore, this problem is exacerbated in computer programming where hardware restrictions are common in many applications. There are very few application systems known to the author that are designed with the Ethiopic alphabet. Some of the output of these word processors, as observed from different advertisements, leaves much to be desired. Since there hasn't been published literature on any of these application systems, not much can be said about them. The idea of designing a word processor that can produce high quality Ethiopic documents <b>led</b> <b>us</b> <b>t...</b>|$|E
40|$|The high {{incidence}} of infections characteristic of impaired cell-mediated immunity in patients with hairy cell leukemia <b>led</b> <b>us</b> to study <b>T</b> lymphocyte function in sixteen patients with the lymphocyte transformation test. All patients showed imparied responses to mitogens, attributable {{to one or more}} of the following causes: dilution of responsive T cells by inert hairy cells, shortage of monocytes to give adequate interaction with the T cells and a significant decrease in the number of T cells with Fcmu receptors proportional to the percentage of hairy cells in the peripheral blood. The response to antigens was severely depressed; PPD was one of the few antigens that induced positive reactions in half the cases. We conclude that in patients with hairy cell leukaemia, T lymphocyte function, as tested in a proliferative assay, is severely impaired and that this may contribute to the deficient resistance to infection...|$|R
30|$|At the {{managerial}} level, recruitment, hiring, and promotion processes are informed by {{images of the}} successful manager. This image is stereotypically masculine; the successful organization and the successful leaders share {{many of the same}} characteristics, such as strength, aggressiveness, and competitiveness. As Berger et al. (1974) expectations states theory enlightened, that certain traits typically associated with men and women are taken into consideration by hiring managers. Traits like competence and authority are typically affiliated with those of higher status, and because cultural and stereotypical beliefs have <b>led</b> <b>us</b> to associate <b>t</b> 6 [*]+[*]hese, with men, there is a correlation between gender and higher positions within organizations (Berger et al. 1974). Essentially, employers’ expectations of an employee based on status, gender, or role shape the chances of that employee’s opportunity to take on greater and “valuable” responsibility (Correll and Ridgeway 2008). Such stereotyping has been documented, constituting a major barrier to women’s entry into top level hierarchical positions of diverse organizations, including academia and in the public sector till recently (Lühe 2014).|$|R

40|$|Summary. -Comparisons between oestrogen-receptor (RE) -positive or {{negative}} patients {{were made on}} a continuous series of 735 patients with primary breast tumours seen at the major treatment centre in British Columbia between 1975 and 1978. RE positivity was commoner in older patients, and {{was not associated with}} menopausal status independently of age. The concentration of receptor protein also increased with increasing age, but was not affected by menopausal status. Neither RE status nor quantity was associated with any of the epidemiological risk factors studied, which included parity, age at first birth, weight, family history and exposure to oestrogenic drugs and oral contraceptives. Patients with RE- tumours were more likely to present with symptoms other than a breast lump, pain or nipple inversion, and had less-differentiated tumours; they did not differ from RE+ patients in terms of stage, size of tumour, or interval from first symptom. These findings are discussed in terms of the biological origin and determinants of oestrogen receptors. BREAST-CANCER PATIENTS with oestrogen-receptor-positive (RE+) tumours differ from those with RE- tumours in their response to hormonal therapy (McGuire, 1978), survival from diagnosis (Bishop et al., 1979), time to first recurrence (Cooke et al., 1979; Knight et al., 1977) and probably in their response to chemotherapy (Lippman et al., 1978; Kiang et al., 1978). Oestrogen positivity has also been reported to vary with menopausal status (Allegra et al., 1979), age (Fisher et al., 1980), ethnic origin (Nomura et al., 1977) and features of tumour such as histological grade (Maynard et al., 1978), degree of elastosis (Masters et al., 1978), pathological type (Rosen et al., 1975; Kern, 1979) and cell-doubling time (McGuire, 1978). A report based on 45 patients suggests that RE- tumours are more common in women who have had an oophorectomy and have used oestrogenic drugs (Wallace et al., 1978). These many studies, each examining only a few factors, <b>led</b> <b>us</b> <b>t...</b>|$|E
