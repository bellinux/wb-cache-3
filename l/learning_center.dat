40|$|This {{study focused}} {{on the use of}} <b>learning</b> <b>centers</b> in kindergarten. It examined: (a) the policy of the Department of Education with respect to the {{importance}} and implementation of <b>learning</b> <b>centers</b> in kindergarten, (b) the extent to which <b>learning</b> <b>centers</b> are currently being implemented in kindergarten classrooms, and (c) teachers 1 perceptions of <b>learning</b> <b>centers.</b> A questionnaire was distributed to 2 50 kindergarten teachers, representing 50 percent of the kindergarten teachers of each of the Province's 33 school boards. One hundred and sixty-three, or 71 percent, of the teacher questionnaires were completed and returned. A scheduled interview was conducted with the Early Childhood Consultant for the Provincial Department of Education. The theoretical basis for the use of <b>learning</b> <b>centers</b> is found in education as 'process'. The literature review indicates that the use of <b>learning</b> <b>centers</b> is an efficient and competent means of creating a 'process' oriented classroom. Findings from the study revealed that the use of <b>learning</b> <b>centers</b> is encouraged by the Department of Education and is recommended in the major resources which it provides for the kindergarten program. Results of the study indicate that most kindergarten teachers use <b>learning</b> <b>centers</b> in their classrooms and generally perceive them to be beneficial. But many teachers believe that with respect to the implementation of <b>learning</b> <b>centers,</b> they lack sufficient professional preparation and have insufficient materials and resources to do so. Based on findings from this study, recommendations are made for further assistance and support for teachers and for further research. ...|$|R
