5000|$|Liquidity - The <b>liquidity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> {{affects the}} {{performance}} of scalping. Each product within the market receives different spread, due to popularity differentials. The more liquid the markets and the products are, the tighter the spreads are. Some scalpers like to trade in a more liquid market since they can {{move in and out}} of large positions easily without adverse market impact. Other scalpers like to trade in less liquid markets, which typically have significantly larger bid-ask spreads. Whereas a scalper in a highly liquid market (for example, a market maintaining a one-penny spread) may take 10,000 shares to make a 3 cent gain ($300), a scalper in an illiquid market (for example, a market with a 25 cent spread) may take 500 shares for a 60 cent gain ($300). While there is theoretically more profit potential in a liquid market, it is also a [...] "poker game" [...] with many more professional players which can {{make it more difficult to}} anticipate future price action.|$|E
5000|$|Speculators {{and market}} makers are key {{contributors}} to the <b>liquidity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>market,</b> or asset. Speculators are individuals or institutions that seek to profit from anticipated increases or decreases in a particular market price. Market makers seek to profit by charging for immediacy of execution: either implicitly by earning a bid/ask spread or explicitly by charging execution commissions. By doing this, they provide the capital needed to facilitate the liquidity. The risk of illiquidity need not apply only to individual investments: whole portfolios are subject to market risk. Financial institutions and asset managers that oversee portfolios are subject to what is called [...] "structural" [...] and [...] "contingent" [...] liquidity risk. Structural liquidity risk, sometimes called funding liquidity risk, is the risk associated with funding asset portfolios in {{the normal course of}} business. Contingent liquidity risk is the risk associated with finding additional funds or replacing maturing liabilities under potential, future stressed market conditions. When a central bank tries to influence the liquidity (supply) of money, this process is known as open market operations.|$|E

Analysis on the <b>liquidity</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emerging <b>market</b> such as the BVMT is very appealing {{because it is the}} most important quality investors look for. Earnings quality seems to influence stocks' liquidity in regard to its impact on the information asymmetry. Based on <b>a</b> sample <b>of</b> 20 firms over a period from 2000 to 2005, we find that there is a statistically significant relationship between our proxy of earnings quality and liquidity after controlling the stock exchange, size, returns of the equity and volatility. Our results support that firms with higher earnings quality have lower bid-ask spreads and lower adverse selection spread components. This result supports theoretical models predicting that more quality of financial and accounting information is associated with <b>a</b> higher level <b>of</b> <b>liquidity.</b> accounting; earnings quality; equity liquidity; Tunisia; listed firms; emerging markets. ...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the depth}} and <b>liquidity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> depend on the entry {{decisions}} of all potential participants, each trader assesses them according to conjectures about entry by others. If trade is equally costly across markets, this externality leads to the concentration of trade on one market. If not, it can produce multiple conjectural equilibria, some where trade concentrates on one market and others where large traders resort to a separate market or {{to search for a}} trading partner.

40|$|Papers {{studying}} the <b>liquidity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> {{tend to focus}} on decisions involving the trade-off between the selling price and the time-till-sale for a given set of market conditions. This paper characterizes the effect of a change in market conditions on a single seller where either a “price-increasing ” or a “time-decreasing ” change in market conditions can help a seller. Shamelessly stealing from demand theory, I show how the effect of either type of change on price and on the probability-of-sale can be decomposed into a “value effect ” and a “liquidity effect. ” The analysis focuses on a famously-illiquid market, real estate, but shows how the same ideas can be applied to markets where other selling mechanisms dominate. Two adding-up conditions restrict the set of possible predictions regardless of the mechanism. In this way, I offer a general theory of how markets adjust to changing conditions...|$|E

The debate arises: Is it this lack <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> maturity matter? Would liquidity arise itself with more companies going public and more investors trading? In order to answer these questions and better understand the liquidity phenomenon, we have applied a multivariate analysis over the shares of the listed companies at the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of London Stock Exchange (LSE), which is considered the most developed alternative market all over the world. We have analyzed the evolution of the Turnover ratio in about 300 companies during five years following their Initial Public Offering (IPO).

What are the properties of equilibrium in dynamic markets for lemons? What determines the <b>liquidity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> good? Which <b>market</b> structures perform better, decentralized ones, in which trade is bilateral and prices are negotiated, or centralized ones, in which trade is multilateral and agents are price‐takers? Is there a role for government intervention? We show that when the horizon is finite and frictions are small, decentralized markets are more liquid and perform better than centralized markets. Moreover, the surplus realized is above the static competitive surplus, and decreases as the horizon grows larger, approaching the static competitive surplus as the horizon becomes infinite even if frictions are non‐negligible. Subsidies on low quality or taxes on high quality raise surplus.

40|$|With the {{elimination}} of the federal deficit, the Bank of Canada, the Department of Finance, and financial market participants are examining ways to manage the reduction in the stock of marketable debt. This paper summarizes three different methods ¯ reverse auction, over-the-counter purchases, and conversions ¯ {{that could be used to}} buy back Government of Canada bonds before they mature. The relation between the size of bond benchmark issues and the <b>liquidity</b> <b>of</b> the government securities market is examined. It is argued that the consolidation of bond issues, as well as the maintenance of large benchmarks, tends to enhance market liquidity. Thus, in an environment where the government's marketable debt is shrinking, purchasing off-the-run bonds ahead of maturity and the maintenance of large bond benchmarks helps maintain, and possibly enhances, the <b>liquidity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> government securities <b>market.</b> In discussing the buy-back mechanics, reverse auctions are shown to be similar to conventional bond auctions except that tenders are made for the sale rather than the purchase of securities. Following this, the paper examines two over-the-counter repurchase methods. The first is similar to the coupon-pass approach used by the Federal Reserve. The second is simply direct over-the-counter purchases in the secondary market. Finally, the mechanics that underlie conversions (switches) are shown to be similar to reverse auctions or coupon passes except that the investors receive a liquid bond issue in return for tendering the less-liquid issue.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{existence}} of commonality in the <b>liquidity</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emerging stock <b>market</b> that applies <b>an</b> order-driven trading system. Moreover, this study explores the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables and stock market liquidity. In addition, it examines the relation between stock liquidity and expected return. This study examines the market-wide co-movements in liquidity within the Malaysian stock exchange using <b>a</b> broad sample <b>of</b> 125 stocks covering <b>a</b> period <b>of</b> more than 16 years, which is also used in analysing the relation between macroeconomic variables and stock market liquidity. Value-weighted market liquidity variables are used in our estimation. The results show that commonality in liquidity does exist in the Malaysian stock market. To further detect existence of commonality in the Malaysian stock market, the sample is classified into three categories: large, medium, and small companies. Commonality was present within the findings of all three categories. The commonality analysed within the cross-lists, and within the <b>market</b> as <b>a</b> whole, classifies the samples under two categories, one being the crosslisted companies in both Malaysian and foreign markets, and the other identified as companies that are exclusively listed on the Malaysian stock market. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first analysis of the association between market liquidity and market variables (return, trading activity, and volatility), and macroeconomic variables (industrial production, real effective exchange rate, investment portfolio, and interest rate), in <b>an</b> emerging <b>market,</b> conducted through the VAR model. The vector autoregression analysis was first conducted between the market liquidity and market variables; and again it was conducted in one vector consisting <b>of</b> market <b>liquidity</b> and macroeconomic variables. The sub-samples analysis have shown that the dynamic relation linking both market and macroeconomic variables to market liquidity vary throughout the whole sample period while their impacts were stronger before the Asian economic crisis in 1997. This is due to the capital control policy implemented in Malaysia after the Asian economic crisis in 1997. The relationship between stock returns and deficiency in liquidity was examined and the results show a positive significant relation between a deficient liquidity system and expected returns over 15 years. Moreover, we examined the size effect on the relation between both the liquidity apparent in big and small stock markets, and their respective returns.
