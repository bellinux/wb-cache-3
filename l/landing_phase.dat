UHF links, relayed through Mars orbiters during the entry, descent and <b>landing</b> <b>phase</b> and while operating {{on the surface of}} Mars. The UHF system on Phoenix is compatible with relay capabilities of NASA’s Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and with the European Space Agency’s Mars Express.

25|$|The entry-descent-landing (EDL) system {{differs from}} those {{used for other}} {{missions}} in {{that it does not}} require an interactive, ground-generated mission plan. During the entire <b>landing</b> <b>phase,</b> the vehicle acts autonomously, based on pre-loaded software and parameters. The EDL system was based on a Viking-derived aeroshell structure and propulsion system for a precision guided entry and soft landing, in contrasts with the airbag landings that were used by the mid-1990s by the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration Rover missions. The spacecraft employed several systems in a precise order, with the entry, descent and landing sequence broken down into four parts—described below as the spaceflight events unfolded on August 6, 2012.|$|E

25|$|The {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} accident was the loss of spatial orientation by the crew and chiefly by the Captain who was piloting the aircraft during the <b>landing</b> <b>phase.</b> The plane banked left, overturned and went into a rapid descent. The loss of spatial orientation occurred in the night, while flying in the clouds, with autopilot and autothrottle switched off. Poor CRM and insufficient training for using the Western type of attitude indicators contributed to the accident. The pilots had previously flown Tupolev Tu-134 and Antonov An-24 with {{a different type of}} attitude indicator (where the bank angle is shown by the movements of an aircraft symbol, and the indicator's background does not turn left or right).|$|E
25|$|The sites {{occupation}} {{begins with}} a Jaketown Phase occupation evidenced by a scattering of Poverty Point objects in the lowest levels of excavations. This is followed, after a hiatus evidenced by a complete lack of Tuscola Phase materials, by an early Marksville period component tentatively assigned an early Anderson <b>Landing</b> <b>Phase</b> that may have lasted into an early Issaquena times. The succeeding late Issaquena Phase and Deasonville Phases are virtually unrepresented at Holly Bluff. The site was again occupied from {{the lower half of}} the Baytown period up to the late prehistoric times. All phases of the local sequence from the Bayland on through the Lake George Phase (1350-1500)(of which the site is the type site for the Lower Yazoo Basin Plaquemine chronology) are abundantly documented. Materials of the Crippen Point Phase of the Late Coles Creek appear to be most widely spread, and it may have been at this time that the settlement attained its greatest size. In the final Lake George Phase additions were made to some of the mounds, especially Mound A, and the enclosing embankment was built, but the total area occupied was perhaps not as large as in the preceding period.|$|E

5000|$|In newts, {{there is}} no true {{metamorphosis}} [...] because newt larvae already feed as predators and continue doing so as adults. Newts' gills are never covered by a gill sac and will be resorbed only just before the animal leaves the water. Just as in tadpoles, their lungs are functional early, but newts use them less frequently than tadpoles. Newts often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer, and a <b>land</b> <b>phase</b> in winter. For adaptation to a water phase, prolactin is the required hormone, and for adaptation to the <b>land</b> <b>phase,</b> thyroxin. External gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time.|$|R
40|$|Six {{experimental}} investigations {{conducted in}} the transonic dynamics tunnel, which supported elements of the entry and the <b>landed</b> <b>phases</b> of the Viking mission, are described. The objective of each investigation and selected experimental results are presented. How these particular wind tunnel results contributed to spacecraft development and ultimately {{to the success of}} the Viking mission is indicated. Experimental studies applicable to the entry phase of the mission included parachute environment and performance definition, aerodynamic characteristics exhibited by two separating bodies, and pressure measurements in the transonic range to optimize the location and orientation of a stagnation-pressure sensor on the Lander. The experimental investigations which supported the <b>landed</b> <b>phase</b> of the mission included a convective heat transfer test to establish the requirements for wind covers for the radioisotope thermoelectric generators and two tests which supported the development and calibration of the meteorological science experiment...|$|R
500|$|Operation Neptune, the <b>landing</b> <b>phase</b> of Overlord, {{called for}} a five-division front spread across [...] of coastline; three {{airborne}} divisions (two American, one British, which also included a Canadian battalion) would also land in the pre-dawn hours of D-Day. Eisenhower and General Bernard Montgomery hoped to have eight infantry divisions and fourteen tank regiments in the Normandy beachhead by nightfall on D-Day. The landing zone was divided into five landing areas, with the Americans attacking Utah (the westernmost) and Omaha, and the British attacking Gold and Sword. Juno, a [...] stretch of shoreline between La Rivière {{to the west and}} Saint-Aubin to the east, was assigned to the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division (3rd CID), commanded by Major-General Rod Keller. Juno included the villages of Courseulles and Bernières.|$|E

His command of destroyer operations in the North Sea over the winter, 1939–40, earned him the Clasp to the Iron Cross 1st Class. On 1 January 1940, {{he was promoted to}} [...] Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral). In April 1940 he was given temporary command of the entire German surface fleet during the initial <b>landing</b> <b>phase</b> of Operation Weserübung, the invasions of Denmark and Norway.

2500|$|In a {{tumbling}} pass, dismount or vault, landing is {{the final}} phase, following take off and flight This is a critical skill in terms of execution in competition scores, general performance, and injury occurrence. Without the necessary magnitude of energy dissipation during impact, the risk of sustaining injuries during somersaulting increases. These injuries commonly occur at the lower extremities such as: cartilage lesions, ligament tears, and bone bruises/fractures. To avoid such injuries, and to receive a high performance score, proper technique must {{be used by the}} gymnast. [...] "The subsequent ground contact or impact <b>landing</b> <b>phase</b> must be achieved using a safe, aesthetic and well-executed double foot landing." [...] A successful landing in gymnastics is classified as soft, meaning the knee and hip joints are at greater than 63 degrees of flexion.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{an article}} in the German [...] {{magazine}} Der Spiegel, the aircraft was considerably iced over and the pilot's visibility almost impossible. According to the accident report, it could not be ruled out that during the critical <b>landing</b> <b>phase</b> the pilot suffered from a cardiovascular disorder, precluding him from being able to control the aircraft any longer. He could not control the further progress of the flight on account of the rather poor stall performance of the aircraft type, the extraordinary difficulties to control a stall during instrument flight conditions, and the insufficient height available for transition from a stall to a normal attitude after the aircraft. The copilot could not level off the aircraft because of the very low altitude. The report ended with the sentence, [...] "Other causes could also have contributed to the accident." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lütjens' mission {{then was}} to draw British units away from Narvik and {{facilitate}} the landings there {{and prevent the}} Royal Navy from attacking the destroyers and landing craft. During the <b>landing</b> <b>phase,</b> his forces were approached by a Royal Navy task-force led by the battlecruiser [...] The British ship engaged at 05:05 and Lütjens was forced to fight an inconclusive battle with Renown. Lütjens succeeded in extracting the German vessels without incurring major battle damage. He viewed his operation as a success. Lütjens nearly changed his mind during the battle, believing a pitched fight may bring relief to the German destroyer force at Narvik—a force which he had effectively been forced to abandon {{in the face of}} enemy sea superiority. But the prospect of running into , now known by German naval intelligence to be in the vicinity, {{was too much of a}} risk. In the resultant Battles of Narvik 10 German destroyers were sunk and the campaign for the port lasted until June. Bonte was killed when his command ship, [...] Wilhelm Heidkamp exploded.|$|E
