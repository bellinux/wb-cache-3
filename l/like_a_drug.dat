5|$|Midway {{through the}} poem, {{there is a}} split between the two actions of the poem: the first {{attempts}} {{to identify with the}} nightingale and its song, and the second discusses the convergence of the past with the future while experiencing the present. This second theme is reminiscent of Keats's view of human progression through the Mansion of Many Apartments and how man develops from experiencing and wanting only pleasure to understanding truth as a mixture of both pleasure and pain. The Elysian fields and the nightingale's song {{in the first half of}} the poem represent the pleasurable moments that overwhelm the individual <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>drug.</b> However, the experience does not last forever, and the body is left desiring it until the narrator feels helpless without the pleasure. Instead of embracing the coming truth, the narrator clings to poetry to hide from the loss of pleasure. Poetry does not bring about the pleasure that the narrator original asks for, but it does liberate him from his desire for only pleasure.|$|E

500|$|Ahead of {{the fourth}} series, Russell T Davies {{acknowledged}} that the character of Gwen can be both loved and hated by the audience. He stated that as an actress Myles isn't preoccupied with her character being presented in a sympathetic light, being able [...] "to take that extraordinary deep breath and not care". io9's Charlie Jane Anders observed that the TV episode [...] "The Categories of Life", written by Jane Espenson, exposed the character's [...] "human vanity" [...] by showing that she has [...] "started to believe her own hype". In Anders' eyes, the character is responsible for her father's second heart attack because of her rash actions. Anders felt that later episodes in the fourth series continued to illuminate flaws in Gwen's character, describing her as someone with an [...] "addictive personality" [...] who [...] "treats her Torchwood adventures <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>drug</b> that she craves" [...] though she knows they [...] "ruin her relationships {{with her husband and}} child".|$|E
500|$|Greg Kot, {{writer for}} the Chicago Tribune, stated that the track [...] "seduces <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>drug</b> dealer", with Ocean crooning over a laid-back rhythm. Prefix Magazines David Padula commented that it [...] "centers around a jazzy {{keyboard}} lick that dips regularly into more lush surroundings. The crisp percussion is a highlight, but the winning point is the soulful croons and general smoothness of Ocean." [...] Mike Powell's Spin praised Ocean's writing abilities, musing [...] "my 'TV ain't HD, that's too real', the narrator of 'Sweet Life' complains, then returns to his swimming-pool floatie. If the song wasn't so pretty — Ocean's velvety voice, soft jazzy accompaniment — you might even feel bad for him." [...] Killian Fox of The Observer reported that the song {{was one of the}} few times on the album when Ocean was actively courting heavy radio play, describing Sweet Life as a [...] "near-perfect distillation of every blissed-out summer jam from Stevie Wonder onwards." [...] Amy Dawson, critic for Metro, called the composition [...] "an irresistibly warm slice of old-school funk." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{aspects of}} Christ Illusions content and {{promotion}} generated adverse attention and publicity. In particular the cover art, painted by Larry Carroll and depicting a mutilated, stoned Jesus. Carroll, who had painted the cover artwork to previous Slayer albums such as Reign in Blood, South of Heaven and Seasons in the Abyss, resumed duties on Christ Illusion. Working solely from track names and formative lyrics, Carroll produced the original on a 4-by-4-foot slab of wood {{using a combination}} of media. Having requested an image of Christ in [...] "a sea of despair", King commented that an early version seemed as though Christ was [...] "chilling out in the water". The final image portrays Christ with a missing eye and amputated hands, and standing amidst a sea of blood and severed heads. Araya deemed this version [...] "much better because he looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>drug</b> addict!", while King admired the artwork enough to purchase the original. Certain album pre-orders gave fans the chance to win one of ten autographed lithographs of the artwork, while an alternative, non-graphic cover was made to appease retailers who had refused to stock the original version.|$|E

Moore would later guest star in the episodes [...] "Winter Madness", [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter", [...] "Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land", and [...] "I Do Do". In an interview with USA Today in October 2009, Fey said that Jack would find more enduring love in the upcoming season.

500|$|In 1984, {{she entered}} private practice, joining the {{commercial}} litigation practice group of Pavia & Harcourt in Manhattan as an associate. One of 30 attorneys {{in the law}} firm, she specialized in intellectual property litigation, international law, and arbitration. [...] She later said, [...] "I wanted to complete myself as an attorney." [...] Although she had no civil litigation experience, the firm recruited her heavily, and she learned quickly on the job. [...] She was eager to try cases and argue in court, rather than {{be part of a}} larger law firm. Her clients were mostly international corporations doing business in the United States; much of her time was spent tracking down and suing counterfeiters of Fendi goods. In some cases, Sotomayor went on-site with the police to Harlem or Chinatown to have illegitimate merchandise seized, in the latter instance pursuing a fleeing culprit while riding on a motorcycle. She said at the time that Pavia & Harcourt's efforts were run [...] "much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>drug</b> operation", and the successful rounding up of thousands of counterfeit accessories in 1986 was celebrated by [...] "Fendi Crush", a destruction-by-garbage-truck event at Tavern on the Green. At other times, she dealt with dry legal issues such as grain export contract disputes. In a 1986 appearance on Good Morning America that profiled women ten years after college graduation, she said that the bulk of law work was drudgery, and that while she was content with her life, she had expected greater things of herself coming out of college. [...] In 1988 she became a partner at the firm; she was paid well but not extravagantly. She left in 1992 when she became a judge.|$|E

A few Creatures have admittedly stated they can now desist in their beer smuggling efforts, which they were able to do for years with the help of local delis who used to wrap up sandwiches with beer cans.

2500|$|In September 2007, in Ohio, 16-year-old Daniel Petric snuck out of {{his bedroom}} window to {{purchase}} the game Halo 3 against the orders of his father, a minister at New Life Assembly of God in Wellington, Ohio, U.S. His parents eventually banned him from the game after he spent up to 18 hours a day with it, and secured it in a lockbox in a closet where the father also kept a 9mm handgun according to prosecutors. In October 2007, Daniel used his father's key to open the lockbox and remove the gun and the game. He then entered {{the living room of}} his house and shot both of them in the head, killing his mother and wounding his father. Petric was {{sentenced to life in prison}} without parole, which was later commuted to 23 years in prison. Defense attorneys argued that Petric was influenced by video game addiction. The court dismissed these claims. The judge, James Burge, commented that while he thought there was ample evidence the boy knew what he was doing, Burge thought the game had affected him <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>drug,</b> saying [...] "I firmly believe that Daniel Petric had no idea at the time he hatched this plot that if he killed his parents they would be dead forever." ...|$|E
