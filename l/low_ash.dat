25|$|Solidifying: Solidifiers are {{composed}} of tiny, floating, dry ice pellets, and hydrophobic polymers that both adsorb and absorb. They clean up oil spills by changing the physical state of spilled oil from liquid to a solid, semi-solid or a rubber-like material that floats on water. Solidifiers are insoluble in water, therefore {{the removal of the}} solidified oil is easy and the oil will not leach out. Solidifiers have been proven to be relatively non-toxic to aquatic and wild life and have been proven to suppress harmful vapors commonly associated with hydrocarbons such as Benzene, Xylene, Methyl Ethyl, Acetone and Naphtha. The reaction time for solidification of oil is controlled by the surface area or size of the polymer or dry pellets as well as the viscosity and thickness of the oil layer. Some solidifier product manufactures claim the solidified oil can be thawed and used if frozen with dry ice or disposed of in landfills, recycled as an additive in asphalt or rubber products, or burned as a <b>low</b> <b>ash</b> fuel. A solidifier called C.I.Agent (manufactured by C.I.Agent Solutions of Louisville, Kentucky) is being used by BP in granular form, as well as in Marine and Sheen Booms at Dauphin Island and Fort Morgan, Alabama, to aid in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill cleanup.|$|E
500|$|In 1709, at Coalbrookdale in Shropshire, England, Abraham Darby {{began to}} fuel a blast furnace with coke instead of charcoal. [...] Coke's initial {{advantage}} was its lower cost, mainly because making coke required much less labor than cutting trees and making charcoal, but using coke also overcame localized shortages of wood, especially in Britain {{and on the}} Continent. [...] Metallurgical grade coke will bear heavier weight than charcoal, allowing larger furnaces. [...] A disadvantage is that coke contains more impurities than charcoal, with sulfur and phosphorus being especially detrimental to the iron's quality. [...] Coke's impurities were {{more of a problem}} before hot blast reduced the amount of coke required and before <b>low</b> <b>ash</b> and low sulfur coal was used and manganese was added to tie up sulfur.|$|E

40|$|The fibre {{concentration}} and extent {{and severity of}} fibrosis have been analysed in 48 specimens from the left lung of a patient with asbestosis. Two different methods of fibre analysis were used. The results obtained by transmission electron microscopy were 2 - 2. 5 times higher than those obtained by scanning electron microscopy. <b>Low</b> temperature <b>ashed</b> samples showed on average {{twice the number of}} fibres obtained after wet digestion of the samples. The transmission electron microscope detected considerably shorter fibres than the scanning electron microscope. <b>Low</b> temperature <b>ashing</b> produced also shorter fibres compared with the wet digestion procedure. A statistically significant correlation between fibre {{concentration and}} the grade of fibrosis was found only for <b>low</b> temperature <b>ashed</b> samples analysed in the transmission electron microscope. When dividing the lung into nine anatomical compartments and pooling the grade of fibrosis and the fibre concentration data within each compartment, an even better correlation was obtained...|$|R

40|$|The use and {{characterization}} of the first Certified Reference Material (CRM) of Brazilian coal for analytical quality control are presented.

40|$|Cement-based {{materials}} were investigated {{by comparing the}} strength and microstructure of pastes and mortar containing limestone powder or <b>low</b> quality fly <b>ash.</b> The compressive strength of the mortar at 28 and 90 [*]d was examined whose microstructures were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis, and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA).

The limestone powder mainly acted as inert filler and hardly took part in the chemical reaction. <b>Low</b> quality fly <b>ash</b> may accelerate the formation of hydration products in samples with more chemically bonded water. This further resulted in a higher degree of cement hydration and denser microstructure, while the overall heat of hydration was reduced.

40|$|The {{properties}} of roller compacted concrete (RCC) with high dosage <b>low</b> quality fly <b>ash</b> are investigated, including strength, elastic modulus, ultimate tensile strain, drying shrinkage, autogenous deformation and durability, meanwhile the microstructure {{of the same}} paste containing <b>low</b> quality fly <b>ash</b> and ground <b>low</b> quality fly <b>ash</b> are studied, too.

The results indicate that ground fly ash {{plays the role of}} active component besides the physical filling effect at early age, while after 90 days, the surface of the glass beads is erroded and a lot of calcium silicate hydrate and calcium hydroxide staggered as storied dense structure. <b>Low</b> quality fly <b>ash</b> can accelerate the formation of hydration products, resulting in higher degree of cement hydration and denser microstructure, while the hydration heat in total is reduced.
