2500|$|The name {{army ant}} [...] (or <b>legionary</b> <b>ant</b> or marabunta) {{is applied to}} over 200 ant species, in {{different}} lineages, due to their aggressive predatory foraging groups, known as [...] "raids", in which huge numbers of ants forage simultaneously over a certain area.|$|E
50|$|Leptanilla japonica is an {{uncommon}} highly migratory, subterranean ant found in Japan. They are tiny insects, with workers measuring about 1.2 mm and queens reaching to about 1.8 mm, {{and live in}} very small colonies {{of only a few}} hundred individuals at a time (as compared to the 60,000 to 20,000,000 individuals of <b>legionary</b> <b>ant</b> colonies.) Its sexual development follows a seasonal cycle that affects the colony’s migration and feeding habits, and vice versa. L. japonica exhibits specialized predation, with prey consisting mainly of geophilomorph centipedes, a less reliable food source that also contributes to their high rate of nest migration. Like ants of genera Amblyopone and Proceratium, the Leptanilla genus engages in larval hemolymph feeding (LHF), with the queen using no other form of sustenance. LHF is an advantageous alternative to the more costly cannibalism. Unlike any other ant, however, members of Leptanilla, including L. japonica, have evolved a specialized organ dubbed the “larval hemolymph tap” that reduces the damage LHF inflicts on the larvae. LHF has become this species' main form of nutrition.|$|E
40|$|The {{colonies of}} army ants {{and some other}} <b>legionary</b> <b>ant</b> species have single, {{permanently}} wingless queens with massive post petioles and large gasters. Such highly modified queens are called dichthadiigynes. This paper presents the unusually rich exocrine gland endowment of dichthadiigynes, which is not found in queens of other ant species. It has been suggested these kinds of glands produce secretions that attract and maintain worker retinues around queens, especially during migration. However, large worker retinues also occur in non-legionary species whose queens do not have such an exuberance of exocrine glands. We argue and present {{evidence in support of}} our previously proposed hypothesis that the enormous outfit of exocrine glands found in dichthadiigynes is due to sexual selection mediated by workers as the main selecting agents...|$|E
2500|$|Historically, [...] "army ant" [...] in {{the broad}} sense, {{referred}} to various members of five different ant subfamilies: in two of these cases, the Ponerinae and Myrmicinae, only a few species and genera exhibit legionary behavior; in the other three lineages, Ecitoninae, Dorylinae, and Leptanillinae, all of the constituent species are <b>legionary.</b> More recently, <b>ant</b> classifications now recognize an additional New World subfamily, Leptanilloidinae, which also consists of obligate legionary species, so is another group now included among the army ants.|$|R
