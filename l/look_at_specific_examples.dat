Numerous {{past research}} projects {{have observed that}} one can compress one object relative to another one by computing {{the differences between the}} two, but these delta-encoding systems have almost invariably required knowledge of a specific relationship between them [...] -most commonly, two versions using the same name at different points in time.

We also <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>specific</b> <b>examples</b> of these codes. 1. Introduction A binary greedy code of length n and designed distance d is generated by arranging the binary vectors of length n in some ordering. The first vector is selected for the code. Then, proceeding once through the ordering, a vector is selected if it differs from all previously chosen vectors in d or more places. Surprisingly, this set of vectors is linear, if the ordering is a B-ordering [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Greedy codes have been studied for several years, by Levenstein [4], Conway and Sloane [2], Pless and Brualdi [1], and others. Recently, A. J. van Zanten [7] generalized greedy codes by considering a set of difference vectors. A vector v is chosen for the code if all of the difference vectors vÅc are in the set of permitted vectors, where c is in the code. He showed that if th [...] ...|$|E

40|$|A {{state in}} quantum {{mechanics}} {{is defined as a}} positive operator of norm 1. For finite systems, this may {{be thought of as a}} positive matrix of trace 1. This constraint of positivity imposes severe restrictions on the allowed evolution of such a state. From the mathematical viewpoint, we describe the two forms of standard dynamical equations - global (Kraus) and local (Lindblad) - and show how each of these gives rise to a semi-group description of the evolution. We then <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>specific</b> <b>examples</b> from atomic systems, involving 3 -level systems for simplicity, and show how these mathematical constraints give rise to non-intuitive physical phenomena, reminiscent of Bohm-Aharonov effects.

40|$|Whatever {{the future}} of mankind might be, certain things will {{probably}} never change. People will like to live and to be protected by the society in which they live. They will care for {{the future of}} their children. They will need food and resources and will thus have to think about production, distribution and consumption of resources. Also, as before, they will usually prefer a higher standard of living to a lower one. If we agree on these assuptions, is it then possible to predict limiting society forms for possible developments of human societies? Bruss and Duerinckx (Ann. Appl. Probab. to appear, 2014) proved that the answer is yes if human societies are modeled by sequences of so-called resource dependent branching processes. Among other results, they show how the survival criteria of the societies forming an envelope of possible societies can be explicitly computed.

40|$|Introducing an {{aggregate}} resource constraint into Mussa and Rosen’s (1978) model of monopoly price discrimination implies an upwards distortion in prod-uct quality for high valuation consumers because the standard downward dis-tortions in product quality for other consumers relax the resource constraint. 1 This paper generalizes {{the model of}} Mussa and Rosen (1978) to include a resource constraint on the aggregate quality produced. The model is related to other work on monopoly pricing with constraints, such as Stokey (1979), Salant (1989), and Anderson and Dana (2006), but these papers consider constraints on the product quality sold to each individual as opposed to constraints on the aggregate quality produced by the firm.

40|$|Global scale {{ecological}} crises {{are often}} {{interpreted as a}} fundamentally 'new' problematic. This perceived novelty has important effects on how we politically interpret the urgency these crises produce {{and the kind of}} solutions, whether cultural, institutional, or technological, that we consider appropriate or ethically defensible. This project, as a whole, responds to this perceived novelty by insisting two basic things: First, any critical theory of ecological politics in this new era must see past the seeming novelty of the Anthropocene and understand that there have been eras of history in which the actors also perceived themselves as new. In particular I will draw parallels between debates over nuclear weapons and population, both global in nature and containing green premises, and show how some of the lessons embedded there regarding humility, irreversibility, agency, and universality can benefit critical theories of 'new' eras like the Anthropocene today. Second, any political theorist seriously approaching global ecological politics must begin by expanding the existing debate beyond the technologically advanced industrial nations, which are both the principal causes of environmental degradation and the chief, and at times only, voices in the global narrative. The second half of this project follows intuitions about simultaneity and subsidiarity to assess the practical politics of localization and cultural decolonization in the context of institutional decentralization.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to explore}} the contribution made by the nobility, both Gallo-Roman and Frankish, {{to the creation of}} a new society after the collapse of imperial authority in the west, Gallo-Frankish society. The first chapter of this dissertation is a review of the sources, both ancient and modern, used in the research undertaken for this dissertation. It is important to realise that, while not as numerous as those of other periods, sufficient ancient material survives to make a study such as this valid. Modern issues and debates will be highlighted, including an indication of what led me to this particular thesis. The second chapter outlines the history of Gaul and the barbarians to the middle of the fifth century. It then looks at the institutions that were the backbone of Gallo-Roman society. The third chapter explores the lives of a number of individuals who lived in Gaul during the late third and fourth centuries. They exemplify the challenges that faced the nobility and the ways they found of facing them. Chapter four introduces the Franks as the successors to imperial rule in Gaul. A narrative history is followed by a study of the institutions that they made use of in establishing their power. Chapter five narrows the focus still further and looks at the role that the monarchy and the nobility had to play in the creation of Gallo-Frankish society.

30|$|Arguably {{the most}} widely used method (in the U.S.) is {{situational}} analysis, either by focused situation or through formalized case studies. Emerging from the field of strategic management, the case study method is used to focus on specific ethical issues. Students learn that their personal moral values may disagree with an organization’s or other stakeholders’ expectations. This method encourages environmental scanning (Fox-Wolfgramm, 2010), and the challenges of making decisions under conditions of complexity and conflict (Ferrell and Ferrell, 2012). The case method also allows integration of regulatory and legislative considerations, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. While the underlying principles, duties and standards of corporate governance were largely unchanged by the Sarbanes-Oxley act, the processes and procedures were significantly changed. This introduces students to the varying levels of complexity accompanying ethical codes and the law. The prominence of stakeholders and directors was increased, altering the consequences (accountability) of unethical activities. By <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>specific</b> <b>examples</b> from multiple perspectives, students are exposed to unforeseen consequences resulting from bad decisions (Mitchell and Yordy, 2010). The case study methodology also allows introduction of social issues that students might not otherwise encounter, such as environmental degradation, human-rights abuses, or toxic dumping.|$|R
40|$|In {{evaluating}} the Middle Ages on film, this thesis combines two different critical approaches, drawn from historiography {{on one side}} and semiotics on the other. In the first chapter, I argue that historiographic criticism has largely undermined our belief in a monolithic, objective History, and that modern historical enquiry contains a tacit admission of its own subjectivity. In Chapter Two, I use these admissions to argue the case for history on film, demonstrating that in terms of the construction of history, the processes of filmmaking closely resemble those of â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 doingâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 history, and that criticisms of historical films are often the same criticisms which Historians raise in respect of their own works of â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 pure historyâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9. In the remaining chapters (3 - 6), I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>specific</b> <b>examples</b> of types of historical character, drawn from the medieval separation of society into â 8 ̆ 09 ̆cthose who work, those who fight and those who prayâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆d, as well as â 8 ̆ 09 ̆cthose who ruleâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆d. In each case, I adopt a similar methodological approach, conducting close cinematographic analysis on a range of film extracts in order to see how filmmakers have tried to construct the past visually in their representation of historical characters. Here my arguments move away from historical criticism to focus instead on aesthetics and cinematography. The overall theory is that there exist two fundamental approaches to the medieval past in film: the first iconic and syntagmatic, the second paradigmatic. Iconic approaches, I argue, work to try to recreate the lost medieval referent by using aesthetic â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 signifiersâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 in order to communicate their significance to a medieval audience. The paradigm, on the other hand, works in the opposite way; in order to explain a medieval object, the filmmaker casts about for modern equivalents to use as metaphors. Where the icon recreates the object to communicate the concept, the paradigm communicates the object by re-presenting the concept...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates how dancing salsa {{emerges as}} a {{strategy}} to address issues of gender, class, and national identity formation in a transnational context, {{with a focus on}} Taiwan. I examine the globalization of salsa as a cosmopolitan dance, the intersubjective experience in partner dance, and the ways that gender and national identities are choreographed through salsa’s transnational circuits. In order to trace the trajectory of agency in Taiwanese salsa practice, I propose and develop two special theoretical terms: flow and flirtation. This new approach challenges the individual emphasis of much applied phenomenology by looking at how salsa allows for a multiplicity of intersubjective experiences. By reading salsa as a site of body politics, I argue that salsa enables Taiwanese dancers to flirt with a temporary and imagined identity. 	I examine identity formation in Taiwan in relation to a changing, culturally and historically constructed body (Confucian body, modern body, combative and national body). By contrasting salsa with a genealogy of Taiwanese corporeal conformity, I investigate how salsa provides a semi-sanctioned space for rule-breaking in Taiwan. I argue that Taiwanese salsa practitioners embody exoticism and eroticism as an alternative strategy to dominant Chinese norms that mandate a highly sedate and regulated use of the body. I examine the embodied sovereignty by Taiwanese salsa practitioners. Salsa enables Taiwanese dancers to imagine a future characterized by a global citizenship rooted in Western modernity. This soft resistance is especially useful for Taiwanese who are in a precarious nation-state position to differentiate themselves from a Chinese identification. 	This project is centered on my archival research, and ethnographic fieldwork of salsa practice and performance in Taiwan, Los Angeles, and Shanghai. I ground my argument in the combination of choreographic analysis, national and transnational discourses, cultural studies, and intercultural performance analysis. I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>specific</b> <b>examples,</b> including salsa performances and art works by Larry Shao, Japanese salsa music by Orquesta de la Luz, and the salsa version of the Rite of Spring by Emanuel Gat.

40|$|Protein {{interactions}} play a {{vital part}} in the function of a cell. As experimental techniques for detection and validation of protein interactions are time consuming, {{there is a need}} for computational methods for this task. Protein interactions appear to form a network with a relatively high degree of local clustering. In this paper we exploit this clustering by suggesting a score based on triplets of observed protein interactions. The score utilises both protein characteristics and network properties. Our score based on triplets is shown to complement existing techniques for predicting protein interactions, outperforming them on data sets which display a high degree of clustering. The predicted interactions score highly against test measures for accuracy. Compared to a similar score derived from pairwise interactions only, the triplet score displays higher sensitivity and specificity. By <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>specific</b> <b>examples,</b> we show how an experimental set of interactions can be enriched and validated. As part of this work we also examine the effect of different prior databases upon the accuracy of prediction and find that the interactions from the same kingdom give better results than from across kingdoms, suggesting that there may be fundamental differences between the networks. These results all emphasize that network structure is important and helps in the accurate prediction of protein interactions.

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the imagery of}} Archaic Greek lyric poetry {{and its relation to}} the 'here and now' and to the implied context of performance. Chapter One sets out the conceptual programme and establishes a critical vocabulary. Various theoretical notions are discussed which are drawn from linguistics (deixis and deictic field), philosophy (reference, language games, and possible worlds), and modern literary theory (fictional worlds and text worlds); some new critical tools are established (,imaginative worlds', visual analogies and 'representational planes', the idea of 'degrees of reference'). Chapter Two sets the scene by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>specific</b> <b>examples</b> drawn from sympotic imagery shared by pottery and poetry. The rest of the thesis exemplifies the theory set out initially through a series of close readings from a broad selection of Archaic Greek monody. The close readings start with smaller scale fragments which conjure up worlds corresponding to circumscribed situations, and progress to poems which conjure up more extensive worlds. Chapters Three, Four, and Five <b>look</b> <b>at</b> diverse kinds of erotic poetry drawn respectively from Anacreon, Ibycus, and Archilochus. Chapter Six takes as its subject- matter the martial elegy of Callinus, Tyrteus, and Mimnermus. Chapter Seven moves from poetry which conjures up a markedly heroic world to poetry which conjures a contrasting unheroic world: the iambic poetry of Hipponax. Chapter Eight turns to a political poem by Solon. Chapter Nine concludes the thesis in a ring composition by returning to erotic poetry (Sappho's) and to the theoretical considerations set out in Chapter One.

40|$|In this thesis, we solve a {{mean-variance}} portfolio {{optimization problem}} with portfolio constraints under a regime-switching model. Specifically, we seek a portfolio process which minimizes {{the variance of}} the terminal wealth, subject to a terminal wealth constraint and convex portfolio constraints. The regime-switching is modeled using a finite state space, continuous-time Markov chain and the market parameters are allowed to be random processes. The {{solution to this problem}} is of interest to investors in financial markets, such as pension funds, insurance companies and individuals. We establish the existence and characterization of the solution to the given problem using a convex duality method. We encode the constraints on the given problem as static penalty functions in order to derive the primal problem. Next, we synthesize the dual problem from the primal problem using convex conjugate functions. We show that the solution to the dual problem exists. From the construction of the dual problem, we find a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the primal and dual problems to each have a solution. Using these conditions, we can show the existence of the solution to the given problem and characterize it in terms of the market parameters and the solution to the dual problem. The results of the thesis lay the foundation to find an actual solution to the given problem, by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>specific</b> <b>examples.</b> If we can find the solution to the dual problem for a <b>specific</b> <b>example,</b> then, using the characterization of the solution to the given problem, {{we may be able to}} find the actual solution to the <b>specific</b> <b>example.</b> In order to use the convex duality method, we have to prove a martingale representation theorem for processes which are locally square-integrable martingales with respect to the filtration generated by a Brownian motion and a finite state space, continuous-time Markov chain.

Four different approaches are considered for solving two of their critical problems – aircraft routing and crew scheduling – and we examine {{the pros and cons}} of each of these approaches. We then pose questions for the reader which consider how technological advances can change the assessment of these di¤erent approaches...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} the result of {{research}} and contemplation on the actual usefulness of topology-based methods in real-world applications. We recapitulate commonly used arguments in favor of topology-based approaches first to realign our expectations with respect to the utilization of topology extraction in the context of concrete applications. To illustrate some of our considerations, we take a closer <b>look</b> <b>at</b> one <b>specific</b> <b>example,</b> i. e., the visual analysis of flow through a cooling jacket and we report our respective experiences. After discussing the topology-based analysis of the cooling jacket case, we contrast topology-based flow visualization with an alternative approach, i. e., the interactive feature extraction for feature-based visualization. Without generalizing just from the one concrete example scenario, we still are able to conclude with some broader experiences which we have made in the past and which seem to align well with the opinion of others in our field...|$|R
40|$|This study {{develops}} three themes. It sketches {{a cultural}} history of Rome from approximately 1620 to 1660, investigates {{the background of}} the principal genres of vocal chamber music, canzonetta and cantata, and explores the relationship between music and text in settings of works by the four poets listed in the title. ^ Chapter 1 sketches the intellectual world of early Seicento Rome. It recounts how in the 1620 s circumstances conspired to reconcile Counter-Reformation Catholicism with innovations in science, philosophy, and literature, and how a new wave of repression in the early 1630 s ended this reconciliation, with chilling consequences {{for the rest of the}} century. The chapter closes with a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the place of vocal chamber music in seventeenth-century Rome. ^ Chapters 2 and 3 explore the canzonetta, a strophic poetic genre popularized by Gabriello Chiabrera around 1600. Chapter 2 shows how Chiabrera 2 ̆ 7 s dialogues on the canzonetta, written after trips to Rome in the 1620 s, are related to the city 2 ̆ 7 s cultural ferment, and how they help us understand the relation between music and poetry in settings of such texts. I emphasize how Chiabrera and others argued that the genre was suitable for a wide range of expression. Chapter 3 grounds these observations with <b>specific</b> <b>examples,</b> showing how the poetry of Francesco Balducci and Domenico Benigni was used by composers in sensitive and varied settings. ^ Chapters 4 and 5 provide an analogous <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the cantata. Chapter 4 explores {{the background of the}} genre, clarifying the difficult issues surrounding its origins and terminology, and uncovering relationships between it and other literary and musical genres. Chapter 5 <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>specific</b> <b>examples,</b> turning to settings of poetry by Benigni and Francesco Melosio. ^ The extravagances of Melosio 2 ̆ 7 s style and their larger implications are dealt with in Chapter 6. It examines the dialogues and satires of Antonio Abati, who criticized the shortcomings of music and musical poetry, showing how his musical poetry avoids the imperfections he decried. I end with a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> larger issues, showing how Abati anticipated the wide-ranging critiques of Italian culture that were to appear in the second half of the seventeenth century. ...|$|R
40|$|M. A. University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Humanities (Digital Arts), 2012 This {{research}} report aims {{to identify and}} explore the various aesthetic, narrative and ideological techniques employed by a specific style of contemporary television animation series, through a close case study of the series Drawn Together. I shall define this animation as the contemporary adult-oriented style, one which has found particular favour with a young, media savvy adult audience and enjoys a mostly cult success {{in many parts of}} the world. This style is one which works just as much as a social commentary on various contemporary issues as it does a comedic animated show. The report will provide a historical exploration of this specific style of television animation series by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>specific</b> other <b>examples,</b> including The Simpsons, Beavis and Butthead and South Park,to create a basis of understanding through which to explore the formulation of Drawn Together. In discussing Drawn Together, the report will also provide a history of Drawn Together’s broadcast channel, Comedy Central, in order to understand the show’s entry into commercial markets and the mass media at large...|$|R
