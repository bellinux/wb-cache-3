6000|$|Leland smiled drily. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "if {{the market}} doesn't stiffen, {{we can only}} go under. It would hurt to give up Prospect, {{but it could be}} done. In the meanwhile, I've been {{wondering}} about that waggon. It took me quite a while to screw the <b>lock-nut</b> on with the big box-spanner, and the thing never loosened of itself." ...|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} types of {{different}} wheels: normal plastic, one-way, aluminum, and <b>lock-nut.</b> Normal plastic wheels are fine, {{but they are not}} adequate for really fast cars. They become loose after disconnecting them from the axle several times. Additionally, they create drag when the car going through turns as the axle locks the two wheels at same speed, since the outer wheel must cover more distance than the inner wheel (relatively to the turn of the course). One-way wheels allow either side to roll faster than the other when turning, and minimize the speed loss in turns. Aluminum wheels are very light, sturdy, and best for speed. Some aluminum wheels have preventive measures against loosening with the axle. However, <b>lock-nut</b> wheels are the best in preventing the cars from losing the wheels during a run.|$|E
50|$|Manifolds {{intended}} for use with sets where a regulator is provided for each cylinder {{are connected to the}} cylinder valves upstream of the cylinder valve seat, to a connecting port provided specifically for this purpose. Two styles of connection are available for this arrangement - face seal, and barrel seal. Face seal connections are similar to the DIN regulator connection seal, and consist of an o-ring in a groove machined into the end of the manifold tube, which is clamped against the face of the valve port by a threaded component. Face seals are simple and rugged, but rely on tight connection for a reliable seal, and do not allow any adjustment for cylinder centre distance. Barrel seals use one or two O-rings in grooves around the end of the manifold tube, which seal against the bore of the valve port. They are usually screwed into the valve port with handed thread, and locked with a <b>lock-nut.</b> They are generally slightly less rugged than face seal manifolds, and more vulnerable to thread damage during assembly, but allow a small amount of cylinder centre distance adjustment, and provide a reliable seal even if not completely tight. Manifolds of this type are commonly supplied in sets comprising a manifold and compatible left and right side cylinder valves with a choice of neck thread specification. The working components for all three valves in the set are usually identical.|$|E
50|$|In the NTSB {{investigation}} report, {{the cause}} was attributed to extreme pitch-up to 14g+ caused {{by the loss of}} the port elevator trim tab due to wear in the trim tab mounts, exacerbated by <b>lock-nuts</b> on the mounting bolts losing their self-locking ability due to use past their normal life.|$|R
5000|$|It {{should be}} noted that the [...] "pure stock drag rules" [...] permit a host of modifications, which can be readily ascertained from their website. These include but aren't limited to [...]060" [...] over-bores, milled {{cylinder}} heads per the NHRA tech specs, fast-ramping custom [...] "stock" [...] cam grinds, modern pistons, rings, rods, valves (with multi-angle grinds), etc. Hence, the cars running in that format aren't representative of how the cars ran when brand new. Notably, the cited [...] "12 second" [...] figure was never reported in any enthusiast magazine of the period for any production line stock RAM AIR Pontiac, including the RA II and IV. The only known vintage test of a RAM AIR II car was performed in a modified (Royal Bobcat; reworked cylinder heads, thinner than stock head gaskets, three angle valve job, stiffer valve springs, reworked carb and ignition system, adjustable pushrods with <b>lock-nuts,</b> and fully open long tube Doug's headers) GTO fitted with Cassler slicks, a 3.90 axle ratio, and driven by Royal's now legendary Milt Shornack. As modified, it recorded a 12.77 ET. [...] "High Performance Cars" [...] Magazine tested a then new and early production 1968 [...] "360 HP (SAE Gross) Ram Air" [...] 400 Firebird, though they didn't specifically note it was a RAM AIR II. Its best performance in absolutely showroom stock condition was a 14.19 second ET, with a trap speed of 101.12 MPH, which is comparable to a 2013+ V6 Accord's performance.|$|R
40|$|The T 3 SS injectisome is a syringe-shaped {{macromolecular}} assembly {{found in}} pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria {{that allows for}} the direct delivery of virulence effectors into host cells. It is composed of a "basal body", a <b>lock-nut</b> structure spanning both bacterial membranes, and a "needle" that protrudes away from the bacterial surface. A hollow channel spans throughout the apparatus, permitting the translocation of effector proteins from the bacterial cytosol to the host plasma membrane. The basal body is composed largely of three membrane-embedded proteins that form oligomerized concentric rings. Here, we report the crystal structures of three domains of the prototypical Salmonella SPI- 1 basal body, and use a new approach incorporating symmetric flexible backbone docking and EM data to produce a model for their oligomeric assembly. The obtained models, validated by biochemical and in vivo assays, reveal the molecular details of the interactions driving basal body assembly, and notably demonstrate a conserved oligomerization mechanism...|$|E
