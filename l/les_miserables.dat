5|$|Due to {{the growing}} scale of the project, talks about {{changing}} Versus XIII into the next numbered entry in the series were appearing as early as 2007. When Type-0, originally titled Final Fantasy Agito XIII, was renamed, and the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were presented to Square Enix in 2011, {{it was decided to}} shift the game onto those consoles. For a time, a PlayStation 3 version continued development, but after a title change announcement could not be made in 2012, the shortening lifespan of the console caused concern for the company and team. After some trial and error, the PlayStation 3 was abandoned as lead platform in favor of a DirectX 11-based development structure that allowed for easy porting to the next-generation systems. Another presumed reason for the shift was due to the game's protracted development and escalating budget. The game was rebranded as Final Fantasy XV and began development in this form in July 2012. At the beginning of development, the new team reviewed the content of Versus XIII and decided what could be sensibly carried over to the new project. While many design elements were retained, some needed to be changed or removed. Tabata's new position as co-director and eventually as director was related to this change. Intentions to turn the game into a musical after Nomura had seen the 2012 film adaptation of <b>Les</b> <b>Misérables</b> were vetoed by the higher-ups at Square Enix.|$|E
