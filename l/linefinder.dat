2500|$|Later {{stepping}} switches {{were arranged}} in banks, {{the first stage}} of which was a <b>linefinder.</b> If one of up to a hundred subscriber lines had the receiver lifted [...] "off hook", a <b>linefinder</b> connected the subscriber's line to a free first selector, which returned the subscriber a dial tone to show that it was ready to receive dialed digits. The subscriber's dial pulsed at about 10 pulses per second, although the speed depended on the standard of the particular telephone administration.|$|E
50|$|The Rotary {{system used}} 1st and 2nd linefinders; when a {{customer}} {{picked up the}} phone all free <b>linefinders</b> in the group drove until one picked that customer line. Calls were switched over two, three or four group selection stages followed by a final selector. An office could start with two group selection stages for local calls (a first group level would serve 2000 lines), and be expanded to three group selection stages if it outgrew say 2000 or 4000 lines, depending on the number of first group levels required for other offices in a multi-exchange area.|$|R
5000|$|Later Strowger (SXS) exchanges {{often use}} a {{subscriber}} uniselector {{as part of}} the line equipment individual to each line, which searches [...] "forward" [...] for a first selector. This is more economical for higher calling-rate domestic or business customers, and has the advantage that access to additional switches can readily be added if the traffic increases (the number of <b>linefinders</b> serving a group is limited by the wiring multiple installed). Hence exchanges with subscriber uniselectors were usually used at British exchanges with a high proportion of business customers, e.g. director exchanges, or in New Zealand where the provision of local free calling meant that residential customers had a relatively high calling rate.|$|R
