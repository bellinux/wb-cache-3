In terms of geographic scales, the geomorphological dynamic is very important to explain the landscape structure in arid lands. The Zapotitlán de las Salinas basin illustrate this situation, where four <b>landscape</b> <b>units</b> may be identified. The <b>landscape</b> <b>units</b> are a result of the geomorphological dynamic.

40|$|Belgium's {{soil survey}} data {{collected}} between 1950 and 1970 (pre-Kyoto Protocol) contain more than 13000 geo-referenced soil profile descriptions, which allow the computation of a spatially distributed baseline carbon content for incremental soil depths, based on soil/land-use combinations (<b>landscape</b> <b>units)</b> and multiple matching soil profile observations. The {{results show that}} the soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil inorganic carbon (SIOC) contents of many <b>landscape</b> <b>units</b> do not differ significantly. However, <b>landscape</b> <b>units</b> under forest and grassland tend to contain more carbon. The same is true for <b>landscape</b> <b>units</b> on poorly drained and/or clayey soils, podzols or anthropogenic soils. The change of the SOC in the upper 100 cm of mineral soil follows a logarithmic decline with increasing depth, useful for the extrapolation of SOC of surface layers to deeper layers. SIOC values are strongly related to the geological soil characteristics and increase linearly with depth. Integrating the mean SOC and SIOC content of <b>landscape</b> <b>units</b> over the Belgian territory results in a total soil carbon stock of 303 MtC in the upper 100 cm layer. Ectorganic horizons contain 35 MtC and mineral soil contains 245 MtC in organic form and 23 MtC in inorganic form. These results are shown to be consistent with an independent set of SOC measurements on 3134 surface samples...|$|R
40|$|Since the 80 ´s, {{the use of}} {{satellite}} remote sensing and GIS have became progressively helpful, when users decide to start looking for homogeneous <b>landscape</b> <b>units</b> to establish the ecological zoning.

From satellite data one can extract phytophysiognomies and land use, from maps, one can generate hydrography and topography, and from digital terrain models one can obtain hypsometry and slope classes. Overlaying phytophysiognomies with geomorphology one can obtain <b>landscape</b> <b>units,</b> which, overlaid with slope classes, can generate fragility levels. The zoning map results from the combination of the fragilities, objectives and requirements to preserve the area, Predictive models using GIS and satellite data showed an excellent performance for the definition of ecological zoning...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} the {{application}} of qualitative and quantitative free available data for geographical delineation based on reconnaissance research in vineyard landscape. The results of delineation are useful in agricultural management or environmental planning. Our delineation may serve as the basic information on site conditions of vineyards near Pezinok (Slovakia), with historical use from the beginning of 13 th century. We have studied the actual land cover and classified physiotopes of the study area into a set of relatively homogenous and coherent <b>landscape</b> <b>units.</b> The <b>landscape</b> <b>units</b> defined in this work consist of homogenous physiotopes in terms of their structural and functional characteristics, which have been shaped by natural factors (land-forms, soil type and subtype, geological base, elevation, slope, aspect, solar radiation and normal different vegetation index (NDVI)). The characteristics were used to define 23 <b>landscape</b> <b>units</b> in qualitative delineation (based on both qualitative and quantitative data). Only quantitative characteristics – elevation, aspect, slope, solar radiation and NDVI, were used in a K-means cluster analysis to define the 17 <b>landscape</b> <b>units.</b> The number of <b>landscape</b> <b>units</b> was computed by WB-index, and standardisation of data was computed by factor analysis. The whole classification process was statistically significant. The strength of the grouping procedure was tested by using Discriminant Analysis, which found that 92. 70 % of objects in qualitative and 98. 50 % of objects in quantitative delineation were correctly classified...|$|R

40|$|The Pantanal {{is a large}} {{internal}} delta that is periodically flooded by the Paraguay River and {{its tributaries}} {{as well as by}} local rainfall. Despite its fl at relief, the area is characterized by a large variety of <b>landscape</b> <b>units,</b> which are the result of recent and paleo-river activities and the annual fl ood pulse. During low-water periods, differences in the physical and chemical conditions of the soil, the length of the flood period, and drought and fire stresses lead to different vegetation units that provide a broad range of resources and living conditions for many animal species. Pre-Columbian settlers and, beginning in the early 18 th century, European immigrants recognized the value of these <b>landscape</b> <b>units</b> and managed them accordingly. By contrast, modern-day development schemes aimed at the Pantanal and the surrounding upland have largely ignored the individual features of the targeted <b>landscape</b> <b>units.</b> This will inevitably result in their modification, putting at risk their functions as well as their numerous benefits to the environment and to humans.

The provision of these services differs along the urban–rural gradient, as does their appreciation by local residents. This paper investigates residents’ preferences for cultural services along the urban–rural gradient through a map-based survey {{in and around the}} Dutch city of Maastricht. We focus on the importance of location in explaining these preferences, distinguishing the location of residents (relative to the preferred <b>landscape</b> <b>units)</b> and the location of <b>landscape</b> <b>units</b> (relative to their positions on the urban–rural gradient). The study shows that residents prefer nearby locations for all distinguished cultural services. Locations’ valuation along the urban–rural gradient, however, differs by service type: for cultural heritage locations near the city centre are preferred, while outdoor recreation and sports and passive enjoyment of green landscapes are enjoyed more in rural areas. When considering the spatial distribution of the land-use types that provide these services, we further find that people prefer green areas closer to the city for outdoor recreation and sports and passive enjoyment of green landscapes. The results illustrate the heterogeneity of people’s preferences for cultural services along the urban–rural gradient beyond the distance from their residences. We recommend policy makers to take the urban–rural gradient into account when valuating <b>landscape</b> <b>units,</b> and in particularly the importance of green <b>landscape</b> <b>units</b> close to the city for different cultural services...|$|R
