40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Risk Analysis)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010 In {{recent years}} {{investment}} products {{have become more}} complex by providing investors with various guarantees and bonus options. This increase in complexity has provided an impetus for the investigation into integrated asset and liability management frameworks that could realistically address dynamic portfolio allocation in a risk-controlled way. This thesis presents two stochastic programming frameworks forthe asset and liability management of investment products with guarantees. The asset side of these products usually contains fixed income securities. For this reason we {{are concerned with the}} stochastic evolution of the shape of the term structure of interest rates (or yield curve) over time. Literature in the field of scenario generation for multi-period stochastic programs has stated that the generation of a set of scenarios, which represents the uncertainty in the evolution of these risk factors over time, {{is one of the most}} important and critical steps in the multi-stage stochastic programming approach. The first part of this thesis presents two methods for yield curve scenario generation. The first method uses a moment-matching approach and the second a simulation approach which takes the movement of macro-economic factors into account. In asset and liability management under uncertainty, using stochastic programming, it is sometimes necessary to take into account flexible risk management actions, for example the reinvestment of coupons or the payment of liabilities at time steps smaller than those at which portfolio rebalancing (or restructuring, i. e. changing the portfolio composition) takes place. The yield curve scenarios at these intermediate time points have to be path dependent. Firstly this thesis proposes a momentmatching approach to construct scenario trees with path dependent intermediate discrete yield curve outcomes sufficient for the pricing of fixed income securities. As part of the second approach we estimate an econometric model that fits the South African term structure of interest rates, using a Kalman filter approach. The proposed model includes four latent factors and three observable macro-economic factors (capacity utilisation, inflation and repo-rate). The goal is to capture the dynamic interactions between the macro-economy and the term structure. The resulting model can be used to generate interest rate scenario trees that are suitable for fixed income portfolio optimisation. An important input into our scenario generator is the investor's view on the future evolution of the repo-rate. In practice most financial institutions have views on the macro-economy. These views are produced by means of an economic scenario generator (ESG) or expert opinion. These ESG's only produce forecasts for macro-economic factors, for example the repo-rate and not a complete yield curve. The second part of this thesis introduces and solves two asset and liability problems. The first problem is the asset and liability management of minimum <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> <b>portfolios</b> found in the banking environment and the second problem is the asset and liability management of insurance products with minimum guarantees. We discuss the formulation and implementation of these mUlti-stage stochastic programming models and back-test both models on real market data. Maintaining <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> <b>portfolios</b> involves a high carry cost and is mandatory by law for some financial institutions. Taking this into account, a financial institution's aim is to manage a <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> <b>portfolio</b> in an "optimal" way, such that it keeps the minimum allowed <b>liquid</b> <b>assets</b> to comply with regulations. This thesis proposes a mUlti-stage dynamic stochastic programming model for <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> <b>portfolio</b> management. The model allows for portfolio rebalancing decisions over a multiperiod horizon, as well as for flexible risk management actions, such as reinvesting coupons at intermediate time steps. The second problem is the asset and liability management of insurance products with minimum guarantees. This thesis proposes a mUlti-stage dynamic stochastic programming model for the integrated asset and liability management of insurance products with guarantees that minimise the down-side risk of these products. We investigate with-profits guarantee funds by including regular bonus payments while keeping the optimisation problem linear. The main focus is the formulation and implementation of a multi-stage stochastic programming model Dynamic optimization is perceived to be too difficult.

We demonstrate that fiat money may also have value in capital-rich economies, {{if the price of}} capital is excessively volatile. Excess asset-price volatility is generated by news; information that has no social value, but is privately useful in forming forecasts over the short-run return to capital. One advantage of fiat money is that its expected return is not linked directly to news concerning the prospects of an underlying asset. When money and capital compete as media of exchange, excess volatility in the short-term returns of <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> <b>portfolios</b> is mitigated and welfare is improved.

40|$|This paper re-examines the {{potential}} gains from diversifying <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> holdings internationally. In particular, it recognizes {{the fact that}} international investors must forecast the expected returns and evaluate the exchange risks associated with foreign assets before the optimum diversified portfolio can be selected. Using three possible forecasting techniques (the martingale, submartingale, and forward rate models), we conclude that the warranted degree of international diversification, {{in terms of the}} number of assets that should be held, is quite limited. Furthermore, the expected ex ante return from undertaking such diversifiation is not large. It is in the range of two to four percent per quarter depending on the associated risk according to the ex ante efficiency frontiers. More importantly, the actual returns received by investors who diversified optimally ex ante were invariably less than the investor anticipated. The implication is that investors are not being adequately compensated (in terms of realized returns) for the risks they incur in diversifying their <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> <b>portfolios</b> internationally. The use of ex post data in previous studies of the gains from international portfolio diversification may result in an overestimation of the benefits that are likely to be reaped relative to the associated foreign exchange risks. This is, in large part, due to the extreme difficulty in making accurate exchange rate forecasts in the volatile floating-exchange-rate environment of the post-Bretton Woods era.

40|$|Abstract: Tragically, many {{families}} that were most {{exposed to the}} economic dislocations of the recent recession also had very risky balance sheets going into it, characterized by low levels of <b>liquid</b> <b>assets,</b> high <b>portfolio</b> concentrations in housing, and relatively high balance-sheet leverage. We argue that economic vulnerability and risky balance sheets are correlated in the population because they derive from common factors. These include a low stock of human capital, inexperience (relative youth), and, in some cases, the legacy of discrimination in housing, education, and employment. Innate cognitive ability interacts with formal education and on-the-job experience to build human capital, while the legacy of discrimination may attenuate the translation of cognitive ability and education into human capital. Financial {{knowledge of how to}} manage risk also requires time and experience to accumulate and is more valuable to those with high levels of human capital and savings available to invest. Putting these pieces together, individuals and families that are young, less cognitively able, and/or members of historically disadvantaged minorities {{are more likely to be}} both economically vulnerable and hold risky balance sheets due to low financial knowledge. Moreover, balance sheets of economically vulnerable families before the recent recession were especially risky after a decade of financial liberalization and innovation that had increased the access of those financially less sophisticated families to homeownership and historically high leverage. To enhance household financial stability in the future, economically vulnerable families should avoid “doubling down ” with risky balance sheets...|$|R
40|$|The term"excess liquidity"may {{refer to}} the share of <b>liquid</b> <b>assets</b> in bank <b>portfolios</b> (the result of a {{retrenchment}} in bank lending, or a"credit crunch") or to money holdings of the nonbank public.

In this paper, the authors examine the appropriateness of conventional policy instruments for tightening money in two common cases: 1) when there is a voluntary credit crunch because of a rise in perceived risk of default, and 2) when individuals rationed in the goods market in reforming socialist economies accumulate savings involuntarily ("money overhang"). The authors conclude that neither excess liquidity in the banking systems of the developing world nor the money overhang of the reforming planned economies calls for a response of restrictive monetary policy. A more appropriate policy might be a prudent but not overly restrictive monetary policy and reservation of some part of credit for the emerging private sector.

40|$|The {{importance}} of credit in the monetary transmission mechanism has recently attained {{a lot of}} attention due to a growing understanding that credit market imperfections can {{have an impact on the}} monetary policy effectiveness. In this study, using Vector Error Correction Models (VECMs) and Structural Vector Autoregressions (S-VARs), we go in-depth of the role of credit in the Polish monetary policy transmission. Papers on the role of credit in the money transmission mechanism (MTM) in Poland show that the credit channel operates. It seems however, that factors through which it affects the aggregate demand might have changed over time. The most recent study on the bank-level data suggests that the degree of bank liquidity has an impact on its efficiency: the most liquid banks do not reduce their loan supply for firms after monetary policy tightening. Previous works suggested that bank size and capital as well as variables connected with risk taking might have played a role in the credit channel operation. The results presented in this study suggest that the monetary policy impact on loan supply is, if anything, weak. One of the reasons is that Polish banks hold large amounts of highly <b>liquid</b> <b>assets</b> in their <b>portfolios.</b> Banks are therefore able to implement buffer-stock behaviour: in response to a tighter monetary policy, they can reduce their stocks of most <b>liquid</b> <b>assets</b> and insulate loan portfolios. To shed some light on the behaviour of the corporate sector we show how interest rate shocks affect the indebtedness of various types of firms (private, individual. i. e. small privately owned entities employing up to nine persons, state-owned). Since the balance sheet channel (one of the concepts within the broad credit channel theory) stresses the impact of monetary policy on the borrowers. balance sheets, we examine the relationship between loans and financial standing of firms. We find some support for the hypothesis that firms. balance sheets are an important factor in the loan supply function.
