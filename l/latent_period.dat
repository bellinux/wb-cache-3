5|$|The {{effect of}} mercury {{took some time}} – the <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> between {{ingestion}} and the first symptoms (typically paresthesia – numbness in the extremities) was between 16 and 38 days. Paresthesia was the predominant symptom in less serious cases. Worse cases included ataxia (typically loss of balance), blindness or reduced vision, and death resulting from central nervous system failure. Anywhere between 20 and 40mg of mercury has been suggested as sufficient for paresthesia (between 0.5 and 0.8mg/kg of body weight). On average, individuals affected consumed 20kg or so of bread; the 73,000 tonnes provided would have been sufficient for over 3 million cases.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} time between an injury and {{development}} of epilepsy varies, {{and it is not}} uncommon for an injury to be followed by a <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> with no recurrent seizures. The longer a person goes without developing seizures, the lower the chances are that epilepsy will develop. At least 80–90% of people with PTE have their first seizure within two years of the TBI. People with no seizures within three years of the injury have only a 5% chance of developing epilepsy. However, one study found that head trauma survivors are at an increased risk for PTE as many as 10years after moderate TBI and over 20years after severe TBI. Since head trauma is fairly common and epilepsy can occur late after the injury, it can be difficult to determine whether a case of epilepsy resulted from head trauma in the past or whether the trauma was incidental.|$|E
25|$|The {{period between}} {{exposure}} to methylmercury {{and the appearance}} of symptoms in adult poisoning cases is long. The longest recorded <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> is five months after a single exposure, in the Dartmouth case (see History); other latent periods in the range of weeks to months have also been reported. No explanation for this long <b>latent</b> <b>period</b> is known. When the first symptom appears, typically paresthesia (a tingling or numbness in the skin), it is followed rapidly by more severe effects, sometimes ending in coma and death. The toxic damage appears to be determined by the peak value of mercury, not the length of the exposure.|$|E
40|$|Epidemiological {{parameters}} for livestock diseases are often inferred from transmission experiments. However, {{there are several}} limitations inherent {{to the design of}} such experiments that limits the precision of parameter estimates. In particular, infection times and <b>latent</b> <b>periods</b> cannot be directly observed and infectious periods may also be censored. We present a Bayesian framework accounting for these features directly and employ Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to provide robust inferences and quantify the uncertainty in our estimates. We describe the transmission dynamics using a susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed compartmental model, with gamma-distributed transition times. We then fit the model to published data from transmission experiments for foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and African swine fever virus (ASFV). Where the previous analyses of these data made various assumptions on the unobserved processes in order to draw inferences, our Bayesian approach includes the unobserved infection times and <b>latent</b> <b>periods</b> and quantifies them along with all other model parameters. Drawing inferences about infection times helps identify who infected whom and can also provide insights into transmission mechanisms. Furthermore, we are able to use our models to measure the difference between the <b>latent</b> <b>periods</b> of inoculated and contact-challenged animals and to quantify the effect vaccination has on transmission...|$|R
40|$|Rabbits {{infected}} intradermally with 10 (3) Treponema pallidum (Melbourne 1) {{cells were}} examined for their susceptibility to reinfection with 10 (2) T. pallidum cells (homologous or heterologous strains) at various intervals {{after the initial}} infection. At 2. 5 weeks after infection, the rabbits were extremely sensitive to reinfection and developed syphilitic lesions significantly faster (i. e., shorter <b>latent</b> <b>periods)</b> than control rabbits that had not received the initial infection. This phenomenon may represent a state of immunosuppression or hypersensitivity in the infected rabbits. Whatever its etiology (at present unknown), it was a transient state since at 5 weeks after infection the rabbits were no longer different from control rabbits in their susceptibility to reinfection. They showed neither immunity (i. e., longer <b>latent</b> <b>periods)</b> nor immunosuppression or hypersensitivity (shorter <b>latent</b> <b>periods)</b> upon reinfection. At 6. 5 weeks after infection, {{two of the three}} experimental rabbits were fully immune (no lesions upon reinfection), whereas the other rabbit exhibited immunosuppression or hypersensitivity upon reinfection. At 7. 5 and 10 weeks after infection, all of the experimental rabbits were immune to reinfection. We conclude that syphilitic rabbits show a biphasic response to reinfection, consisting of an early phase of enhanced sensitivity to T. pallidum and a later phase of immunity to T. pallidum...|$|R

500|$|Farmers holding grain {{ingested}} it instead, {{since their}} own planting had been completed. Distribution was hurried and open, with grain being distributed {{free of charge}} or with payment in kind. Some farmers sold their own grain lest this new grain devalue what they had.

40|$|Epidemic {{models are}} always {{simplifications}} of real world epidemics.

In the present paper we discuss some such purposes for which a stochastic model is preferable to a deterministic counterpart. The two main examples illustrate the importance of allowing the infectious and <b>latent</b> <b>periods</b> to be random when focus lies on the probability of a large epidemic outbreak and/or on the initial speed, or growth rate, of the epidemic. A consequence of the latter is that estimation of the basic reproduction number R 0 is sensitive to assumptions about the distributions of the infectious and <b>latent</b> <b>periods</b> when using the data from the early stages of an outbreak, which we illustrate with data from the SARS outbreak. Some further examples are also discussed as are some practical consequences related to these stochastic aspects...|$|R
