Under the [...] "one year rule", an expenditure is treated as a capital expenditure if it creates an asset, or secures a like advantage to the taxpayer, having a useful life in excess of one year. The court reasoned that the overriding advantage to the [...] "one year rule" [...] was its ease of application. Additionally the rule eliminates pointless complexity in the calculation of the timing of deductions.|$|R

In this context, the increase in a firm’s value is due to the debt tax shield.
