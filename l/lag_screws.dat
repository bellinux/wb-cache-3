40|$|Abstract Background <b>Lag</b> <b>screw</b> cut-out failure {{following}} fixation of unstable intertrochanteric {{fractures in}} osteoporotic bone remains an unsolved challenge. This study tested if resistance to cut-out failure {{can be improved}} by using a dual <b>lag</b> <b>screw</b> implant {{in place of a}} single <b>lag</b> <b>screw</b> implant. Migration behavior and cut-out resistance of a single and a dual <b>lag</b> <b>screw</b> implant were comparatively evaluated in surrogate specimens using an established laboratory model of hip screw cut-out failure. Methods Five dual <b>lag</b> <b>screw</b> implants (Endovis, Citieffe) and five single <b>lag</b> <b>screw</b> implants (DHS, Synthes) were tested in the Hip Implant Performance Simulator (HIPS) of the Legacy Biomechanics Laboratory. This model simulated osteoporotic bone, an unstable fracture, and biaxial rocking motion representative of hip loading during normal gait. All constructs were loaded up to 20, 000 cycles of 1. 45 kN peak magnitude under biaxial rocking motion. The migration kinematics was continuously monitored with 6 -degrees of freedom motion tracking system and the number of cycles to implant cut-out was recorded. Results The dual <b>lag</b> <b>screw</b> implant exhibited significantly less migration and sustained more loading cycles in comparison to the DHS single <b>lag</b> <b>screw.</b> All DHS constructs failed before 20, 000 cycles, on average at 6, 638 ± 2, 837 cycles either by cut-out or permanent screw bending. At failure, DHS constructs exhibited 10. 8 ± 2. 3 ° varus collapse and 15. 5 ± 9. 5 ° rotation around the <b>lag</b> <b>screw</b> axis. Four out of five dual screws constructs sustained 20, 000 loading cycles. One dual screw specimens sustained cut-out by medial migration of the distal screw after 10, 054 cycles. At test end, varus collapse and neck rotation in dual screws implants advanced to 3. 7 ± 1. 7 ° and 1. 6 ± 1. 0 °, respectively. Conclusion The single and double <b>lag</b> <b>screw</b> implants demonstrated a significantly different migration resistance in surrogate specimens under gait loading simulation with the HIPS model.

50|$|Traditional carvel methods leave a small {{gap between}} each plank {{that in the past}} was filled with any {{suitable}} soft, flexible, fibrous material, sometimes combined with a thick binding substance. This caulking would gradually wear out and the hull would leak. Likewise, when the boat was beached for a length of time, the planks would dry and shrink, so when first refloated, the hull would leak badly unless recaulked — a very time-consuming and physically demanding job. The modern variation is to use much narrower planks that are edge-glued instead of caulked. With modern power sanders a much smoother hull is produced, as all the small ridges between the planks can be removed. This method started to become more common in the 1960s with the more widespread availability of waterproof glues, such as resorcinol (red glue) and then epoxy resin. Modern waterproof glues, especially epoxy resin, have caused revolutionary changes in both carvel and clinker style construction. Whereas in traditional construction it was the nails that provided the fastening strength, now it is the glue. It has become quite common since the 1980s for both carvel and clinker construction to rely almost completely on glue for fastening. Many small boats, especially light plywood skiffs, are built without any mechanical fasteners such as nails and <b>lag</b> <b>screws</b> at all, as the glue is far stronger.|$|E

30|$|<b>Lag</b> <b>screws</b> {{which have}} {{benefits}} of minimal loosening and slippage {{during the initial}} application of loads are increasingly used to join timber members [1]. Construction management {{is an important component}} of ensuring lag screw joints are sufficiently strong, which require managers to exercise more caution than with bolt joints. For example, <b>lag</b> <b>screws</b> often cause wood cracking if screwed in without drilling a pilot hole, or driven in using a hammer [1]. These concerns are not limited to wood cracking: over-tightening <b>lag</b> <b>screws</b> may cause such joints to no longer perform at their true strength. Take for example the case of using a wrench to join a steel plate (or washer) to a timber member with a lag screw. Some of the force generated acts as a compressive force on the timber member, which generates an equivalent pull-out force on the lag screw. Tightening the lag screw until the pull-out force exceeds the wood’s pull-out strength causes the axial force on the joint (“clamp force” below) to weaken, leading to poor adhesion between the two members. Among other construction management-related considerations, builders should ensure that lag screw joints are fastened with the proper amount of torque to prevent this from happening. To determine what constitutes “proper” torque, it is imperative to determine first the degree of clamp force caused by tightening a lag screw, and second how that clamp force relates to the pull-out strength of that screw. While many studies have been conducted on screw joints’ pull-out strength, shear strength, and other mechanical properties [2 – 9], we can find none that regard the relationship between clamp force and pull-out force for <b>lag</b> <b>screws.</b> We are currently developing a high damping shear wall, in which the clamp force of <b>lag</b> <b>screws</b> in wood acts as a frictional resistance force between two timber members or between a timber member and a steel plate [10]. Controlling the clamp force {{is an important part of}} generating the frictional resistance in this project.

40|$|Introduction: The Sliding Hip Screw (SHS) is a {{tried and}} tested method used to treat intertrochanteric hip fractures. Lag screw cut-out is a major {{complication}} of SHS fixation and accepted risk factors are often re-evaluated. We aim to demonstrate a new hypothesis of cut-out using 3 D reconstructive modelling. We propose {{that the risk of}} cut-out is much greater in <b>lag</b> <b>screws</b> with a smaller thread surface area and larger thread volume. Method: The four commonly used SHS lag screw systems (Biomet, Synthes, Stryker and Smith & Nephew) were CT scanned and the images processed and turned into 3 D computer models for further analysis. Results: There were sign I can’t differences between the surface area and thread volumes of the <b>lag</b> <b>screws</b> between manufacturers ranging from 67. 0 mm 2 - 347. 4 mm 2 and 166. 376 mm 3 - 225. 687 mm 3 respectively.

The reamer design of <b>lag</b> <b>screws</b> is also discussed. Conclusion: Although there are many non-modi iable risk factors that contribute to screw cut-out, selecting the right raw materials for SHS fixation will have a favorable impact on the overall risk...|$|E
