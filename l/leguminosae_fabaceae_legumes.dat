Thirteen new families are erected, of which eleven remain current today. These are: Celastraceae, Casuarinaceae, Combretaceae, Cunoniaceae, Haloragidaceae, Hypoxidaceae, Loganiaceae, Pittosporaceae and Rhizophoraceae. He also divided <b>Leguminosae</b> (or <b>Fabaceae,</b> the <b>legume</b> family) into three; although Leguminosae has been restored, Brown had recognised what is now viewed as the fundamental division of the family, and his three families are retained as the Leguminosae subfamilies Caesalpinioideae, Mimosoideae and Faboideae.|$|R

In the present investigation, four tree species (Bauhinia variegate Linn., Cassia fistula Linn., Delonix regia (Hook.) Raf. and Peltophorum pterocarpum (DC.) K. Heyne) of the family <b>Leguminosae</b> (<b>Fabaceae)</b> were characterized in respect of their responses to water stress. Seedlings of those species (20 days old) exposed to water stress (two levels) were analyzed for relative water content, chlorophyll, protein, carbohydrate and proline content.

50|$|It is a hemi-parasitic {{herbaceous}} annual {{plant that}} gains {{some of its}} nutrients from the roots of neighbouring plants. It grows to 25-50 cm tall, with opposite, simple leaves, with a serrated margin. The flowers are yellow, produced on a terminal raceme. The fruit is a dry capsule, which contain loose, rattling seeds when ripe; the plant's name refers to these. Its preferred habitat is dry fields or meadows, where its flowering period is between June and September. The plant can associate with many different host species, notably Poaceae (grasses) and <b>Fabaceae</b> (<b>legumes).</b>|$|R

It is native to much {{of central and eastern}} North America and is particularly common in the Midwest, but it has also been introduced well beyond its natural range. Naturally it can be found growing wild at the borders of woods, along streams or in open meadows. It often has difficulty seeding itself in its native areas due to parasitic weevils that enter the seed pods, making the number of viable seeds very low.|$|R

Of fourteen living {{species in the}} genus, all but one are native to the tropics of the Americas, with one additional species (Hymenaea verrucosa) {{on the east coast}} of Africa. Some authors place the African species in a separate monotypic genus, Trachylobium. In the neotropics, Hymenaea is distributed through the Caribbean islands, and from southern Mexico to Brazil. Linnaeus named the genus in 1753 in Species Plantarum for Hymenaios, the Greek god of marriage ceremonies. The name is a reference to the paired leaflets.|$|R
