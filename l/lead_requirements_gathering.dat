When such communication is not possible traditional software engineering frequently relies on questionnaires and other paper-based methods.

40|$|Incorrect {{requirements}} {{have long}} been considered {{to be one of}} the biggest reasons for failed IT projects. Insufficient requirements are also one of the most expensive sources of error. This is especially problematic within small enterprises, which in nature are time and cost sensitive. The purpose of this experimental case study is to identify efficient <b>requirements</b> <b>gathering</b> activities and by extension an efficient <b>requirements</b> <b>gatherings</b> process for small enterprises by utilizing their unique prerequisites. We gathered data through the execution of five user-centered <b>requirements</b> <b>gathering</b> activities on a small organization. The result of these activities, our observations and a survey were analyzed in order to draw conclusions regarding the success and efficiency of the activities and process as a whole. The results show that by utilizing the prerequisites of small organizations through the use of user-centered activities an efficient <b>requirements</b> <b>gathering</b> process can be accomplished. The results also show that the prerequisites of small organizations combined with the impact of external consultants with the purpose of problematizing the operational procedures contributes to other organizational benefits than the requirements documentation. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} shortfalls {{in relation}} to the <b>requirements</b> <b>gathering</b> phases of simulation. While many developments have taken place around supporting the model coding task of simulation, there are few tools available to assist in the <b>requirements</b> <b>gathering</b> phase. This is surprising as it has been reported by several researchers that the requirements phase can absorb twice as much resources as the coding phase. There are numerous process modeling tools available (over 100) that can and have been used to support the requirements phase of simulation. This paper provides a selective review {{of some of the most}} important {{in relation to}} simulation. A conclusion from this review is that none of the tools available adequately supports the <b>requirements</b> <b>gathering</b> phase of simulation. It is proposed that a process modeling tool be developed specifically to support simulation <b>requirements</b> <b>gathering.</b> The design objectives in the development of the tool are: (1) it should be capable of capturing a detailed description of a discrete event system; (2) it should have a low modeling burden and therefore be capable of being used by non-specialists; (3) it should present modeling information at a high semantic level so that manufacturing personnel can rationalize with it; (4) it should have good visualization capabilities; (5) it should support project teamwork. Based on these design objectives a proposed simulation process modeling tool called simulation activity diagrams (SAD) is presented...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{address the}} {{question}} of why <b>requirements</b> <b>gathering</b> for CSCW systems is substantially different (harder) than other types of computer system, by considering (i) that single user systems often are only useful because users are so flexible; (ii) that we don’t really understand how collaboration works, and hence whether collaborative activities are as flexible; and (iii) that field studies of work activities may tell us much about how that work is arranged, but give us virtually no ideal about how the activities will change as a result of introduction of computer support. The chapter then sketches out a framework for understanding the dynamics of change in work activities, based (loosely) on the role of coordination mechanisms in development and breakdown of shared understanding. This framework is applicable to both the <b>requirements</b> <b>gathering</b> for and user evaluation of CSCW systems. For <b>requirements</b> <b>gathering,</b> it provides a checklist of coordination mechanisms to guide the study of existing work practices. For evaluation of CSCW it uses the key notion of a &quot;coordination breakdown &quot; as an observable phenomenon in use of CSCW systems, with the framework providing a way of diagnosing problems that lead to such breakdowns. 1...|$|R
40|$|<b>Requirements</b> <b>gathering</b> and {{analysis}} {{is the most}} important phase of software development. If done properly it reduces future maintenance costs. It can also stop projects that are unlikely to succeed before costs have become excessive. Different software systems require different approaches to requirements engineering.

The aim is to achieve for requirements engineering a capability level that is comparable to Level 3 of the Capability Maturity Model of SEI for the software process in general.

40|$|Requirement {{elicitation}} is {{a critical}} activity in the requirement development process and it explores the requirements of stakeholders. The {{success or failure of}} this process is based on identifying the relevant stakeholders and discovering their needs as well as the quality of requirements. The quality of the requirements is greatly influenced by methods applied during requirements elicitation process. Only complete and structured requirements make these projects more reliable. The common challenges that analysts face during elicitation process are to ensure effective communication between stakeholders as well as the acquisition of tacit knowledge. Mostly errors in the systems are due to poor communication between user and analyst, and these errors require more resources (time and money) to correct them. The understandability problems during elicitation process of large web projects can <b>lead</b> to <b>requirements</b> ambiguous, inconsistent, incorrect and unusable.
