40|$|The {{influence}} of shot peening on the fatigue durability of normalized carbon steels subjected to variable amplitude loading has been investigated. The relaxation of residual stresses was recorded during the fatigue life time. Strain amplitude spectra were extracted from real spectra recorded from components in service. The results {{were compared with}} data achieved from constant amplitude testing. In both types of tests parallel studies were made on both peened and unpeened specimens. Shot peening leads to pronounced increase in life time, especially for smaller amplitudes. For both variable and constant amplitude <b>loading</b> <b>shot</b> peened specimens exhibit longer life provided the residual stresses during fatigue loading do not relax more than to about 60 % of their initial value. To get an improvement in life time {{of at least a}} factor two for peened specimens, the stress amplitude in constant amplitude loading or the maximum stress amplitude in variable amplitude history must not be more than 20 % larger than the magnitude of the initial residual stresses. This limit corresponds to 1. 2 times the yield strength of the unaffected material...|$|E
40|$|The complex {{geometry}} of cylinder head in heavy-duty diesel engine makes {{grey cast iron}} or compact graphite iron a perfect material choice due to its castability, thermal conductivity and damping capacity. To increase {{the efficiency of the}} engine, the fatigue property of the material needs to be improved. Shot peening is often used to increase the fatigue strength of components. The benefits are associated with the compressive stresses induced and with surface hardening. In this research project, these effects on grey and compact iron have been analyzed for different shot peening parameters using XRD, SEM and fatigue testing methods. The ultimate aim of the project is to increase the fatigue strength of cast irons by optimization of residual stresses. The XRD measurements and SEM examinations revealed that the shot peening parameters including shot size and peening intensity had significant influences on the resulted residual stresses and strain hardening while changing the coverage made little difference. Also differences in the peening results between the two materials were observed, which were ascribed to an effect of the different graphite morphology. Nevertheless, a residual stress profile similar to the one general considered to improve the fatigue strength in steels could be obtained in both grey and compact iron after shot peening. The axial fatigue testing with R=- 1 on the grey iron showed that peening using large shot size and high peening intensity (heavy shot peening) resulted in a fatigue strength reduction of 15 - 20 % in comparison with the mechanically polished surface. The negative effects are likely related to surface damage and relatively high tensile residual stresses in subsurface induced by the heavy peening. Grey cast iron has low ductility in tension and therefore tensile residual stresses may promote multiple cracking and crack networking during cyclic <b>loading.</b> <b>Shot</b> peening using much smaller shots and lower intensity (gentle shot peening) which resulted in a much smaller residual stress field gave no significant changes in fatigue strength. However, a short time annealing at 285 °C of specimens being gently shot peened increased the fatigue strength roughly by 10 %. The improvement could be an effect of precipitates formed due to the heat treatment, which lock the dislocation movement under cyclic loading...|$|E

5000|$|Some {{competitive}} shooters {{choose the}} [...]410 bore {{because of the}} challenge it presents; [...]410 bore guns generally have full chokes to form a tight pattern with the small <b>load</b> of <b>shot,</b> and this makes hitting moving targets very challenging.

2500|$|With {{the recent}} rampant rise in lead shot prices, though, {{a major change}} in handloading shotshells has also occurred. [...] Namely, a {{transition}} among high volume 12 gauge shooters from loading traditional 1-1/8 oz. <b>shot</b> <b>loads</b> to 7/8 oz. <b>shot</b> <b>loads,</b> or even 24 gm. (so-called International) <b>shot</b> <b>loads</b> has occurred. [...] At 1-1/8 oz. per shotshell, a 25lb. bag of lead shot can only reload approximately 355 shotshells. [...] At 7/8 oz. per shotshell, a 25lb. of leadshot can reload 457 shotshells. [...] At 24 grams per shotshell, a 25lb of leadshot can reload approximately 472 shotshells. Stretching the number of hulls {{that it is possible to}} reload from an industry standard 25lb. bag of lead shot by 117 shells has significantly helped mitigate the large increase in the price of lead shot. [...] That this change has also resulted in minimal changes to scores in the shooting sports such as skeet and trap has only expedited the switch among high volume shooters to shooting 24 gm. shotshells with their lesser amounts of shot.|$|R
