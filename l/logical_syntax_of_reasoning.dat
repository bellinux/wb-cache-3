40|$|Providing {{a principled}} {{characterization}} {{of the distinction between}} logical and non-logical expressions is a longstanding issue in the philosophy of logic. In the <b>Logical</b> <b>Syntax</b> <b>of</b> Language, Carnap proposes a syntactic solution to this problem, which aims at grounding the claim that logic and mathematics are analytic. Roughly speaking, his idea is that logic and mathematics correspond to the largest part of science for which it is possible to completely specify by "syntactic" means which sentences are valid and which are not. Despite a renewed interest in the philosophical benefits of analyticity, both inside and outside of Carnap scholarship, Carnap's definition of logical expressions seems to have drawn too little attention. I shall argue that it is worth a second look. More precisely, my aim will be to defend this idea against some technical problems faced by Carnap's way of implementing it and against Quinean attacks on syntax-based conventionalism. Section 1 presents Carnap's definition in the context <b>of</b> <b>Logical</b> <b>Syntax</b> <b>of</b> Language, that is, how exactly the definition works, and why Carnap needs it. In section 2, I review three challenges that have been raised in the literature, and I propose to revise the definition accordingly. I argue that its modified version is immune to the previous challenges, and, to some extent, immune to new challenges as well. In the last section, I suggest that the definition has a philosophical interest of its own, because standard Quinean objections are not as conclusive as one might think when attention is paid to the fact that Carnap requires complete syntactic specification of validities...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{paper is}} an {{interpretation}} of the critique of the Russellian theory of judgment, in Wittgenstein’s Tractatus [5. 5422]. The author holds that the picture theory of language is the Wittgensteinian alternative to Russell’s theory of types, on which his theory of judgment is based. In other words, the idea that a picture cannot represent its own pictorial form, would avoid, with difficulties of its own, the vicious circle that Wittgenstein sees in the theory of types, namely to suppose that a description of the categorical structure of the world may establish the <b>logical</b> <b>syntax</b> <b>of</b> language. From this diagnosis, the author draws important consequences to illuminate the celebrated Wittgensteinian distinction between saying and showing, as well as the Wittgensteinian account of propositional attitudes...|$|R

One of the interpretations has gained keen advocates among Carnap scholars. It was originally provoked by what Caranp said in LSL, and it consists of two parts. First, it indicates that in TLP the possibility of speaking about the logical form of a language within the same language (which {{happens to be the}} only language that there is) had been foresworn by Wittgenstein, but Carnap proved him wrong by producing a book (LSL) written exactly in the manner which had been proscribed by Wittgenstein.

40|$|Abstract In Carnap’s autobiography, {{he tells}} the story how one night in January 1931, “the whole theory of {{language}} structure ” in all its ramifications “came to [him] like a vision”.

We seek to answer this question by placing Carnap’s shorthand manuscript in the context of his previous efforts to accommodate scientific theories and metalinguistic claims within Wittgenstein’s Tractatus theory of meaning.

40|$|In his seminal work “The Concept of Truth in Formalized Languages” (1933), Alfred Tarski {{showed how}} to {{construct}} a formally correct and materially adequate definition of true sentence for certain formalized languages.

Its Postscript, written two years later, however, {{has given rise to}} a considerable amount of controversy. There is an ongoing debate on what Tarski really said in the postscript. These discussions often regard Tarski as putatively changing his logical framework from type theory to set theory. In what follows, we will compare the original results with those presented two years later. After a brief outline of Carnap’s program in The <b>Logical</b> <b>Syntax</b> <b>of</b> Language we will determine its significance for Tarski’s final results...|$|R
40|$|Like {{other members}} of the Vienna Circle, Carnap criticized {{traditional}} philosophy for its lack of clarity and precision, as is well-know from such papers as "The elimination of metaphysics through the logical analysis of language" (1932) and many other writings. In 'The <b>Logical</b> <b>Syntax</b> <b>of</b> Language' (1934), while still entertaining the idea that, in some sense, metaphysics is nonsense, Carnap's critique of philosophy is based on different grounds and aimed at different authors. In this book, his critique of philosophy actually takes the form of an attempt at a reconstruction of philosophy on a new basis. I shall try to examine this attempt and to show why it fails. I shall also try to show how Carnap's thought evolved on this point in later writings, in particular in "Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology" (1950) ...|$|R

[...] (Carnap's early anti-metaphysical works employed Russell's theory of types.) [...] Carnap envisioned a universal language that could reconstruct mathematics and thereby encode physics. [...] Yet Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorem showed this impossible except in trivial cases, and Alfred Tarski's undefinability theorem shattered all hopes of reducing mathematics to logic. [...] Thus, a universal language failed to stem from Carnap's 1934 work Logische <b>Syntax</b> der Sprache (<b>Logical</b> <b>Syntax</b> <b>of</b> Language).

40|$|In this paper, we use {{declarative}} and domain-specific languages for representing expert {{knowledge in}} the field of change management in organisational psychology. Expert rules obtained in practical case studies are represented as declarative rules in a deductive database. The expert rules are annotated by information describing their provenance and confidence. Additional provenance information for the whole - or parts of the - rule base can be given by ontologies. Deductive databases allow for declaratively defining the semantics of the expert knowledge with rules; the evaluation of the rules can be optimised and the inference mechanisms could be changed, since they are specified in an abstract way. As the <b>logical</b> <b>syntax</b> <b>of</b> rules had been a problem in previous applications of deductive databases, we use specially designed domain-specific languages to make the rule syntax easier for non-programmers.

40|$|Throughout {{most of his}} {{philosophical}} career Carnap upheld {{and defended}} three distinctive philosophical positions: (1) The thesis that the truths of logic and mathematics are analytic and hence without content and purely formal. (2) The thesis that radical pluralism holds in pure mathematics in that any consistent system of postulates is equally legitimate {{and that there is}} no question of justification in mathematics but only the question of which system is most expedient for the purposes of empirical science. (3) A minimalist conception of philosophy in which most traditional questions are rejected as pseudo-questions and the task of philosophy is identified with the metatheoretic study of the sciences. In this paper, I will undertake a detailed analysis of Carnap’s defense of the first and second thesis. This will involve an examination of his most tech-nical work The <b>Logical</b> <b>Syntax</b> <b>of</b> Language (1934), along with the monograph “Foundations of Logic and Mathematics ” (1939).

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the relation between}} the early Wittgenstein’s and Carnap’s philosophies of logic, arguing that Carnap’s position in The <b>Logical</b> <b>Syntax</b> <b>of</b> Language is in certain respects much closer to the Tractatus than has been recognized. In Carnapian terms, the Tractatus’ goal is to introduce, by means of quasi-syntactical sentences, syntactical principles and concepts to be used in philosophical clarification in the formal mode. A distinction between the material and formal mode is therefore already part of the Tractatus’ view, and its method for introducing syntactical concepts and principles should be entirely acceptable for Carnap by his own criteria. Moreover, despite the Tractatus’ rejection of syntactical statements, there is an important correspondence between Wittgenstein’s saying-showing distinction and Carnap’s object-language-syntax-language distinction: both constitute a distinction between logico-syntactical determinations concerning language and language as determined or described by those determinations. Wittgenstein’s distinction therefore constitutes a precursor of the object-language syntax-language distinction which the latter in a certain sense affirms, rather than simply contradicting it. The saying-showing distinction agrees with Carnap’s position also in marking logic as something that isn’t true/false about either language or reality, which is a conception that underlies Carnap’s principle of tolerance...|$|R
5000|$|Pitts {{probably}} {{continued to}} correspond with Bertrand Russell; and {{at the age of}} 15 he attended Russell's lectures at the University of Chicago. He stayed there, without registering as a student. While there, in 1938 he met Jerome Lettvin, a pre-medical student, and the two became close friends. Bertrand Russell was a visiting professor at the University of Chicago in the Fall of 1938, and he directed Pitts to go study there with the logician Rudolf Carnap. Pitts met Carnap at Chicago by walking into his office during office hours, and presenting him with an annotated version of Carnap's recent book on logic, The <b>Logical</b> <b>Syntax</b> <b>of</b> Language. [...] Since Pitts did not introduce himself, Carnap spent months searching for him, and, when he found him, he obtained for him a menial job at the university and had Pitts study with him. Pitts at the time was homeless and without income. He mastered Carnap's abstract logic, then met with and was intrigued by the work of the Ukrainian mathematical physicist Nicolas Rashevsky, who was also at Chicago and was the founder of mathematical biophysics, remodeling biology on the structure of the physical sciences and mathematical logic. Pitts also worked closely with the mathematician Alston Householder, {{who was a member of}} Rashevsky's group.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Both realists and instrumentalists {{have found}} it {{difficult}} to understand (much less accept) Carnap’s developed view on theoretical terms, which attempts to stake out a neutral position between realism and instrumentalism. I argue that Carnap’s mature conception of a scientific theory as the conjunction of its Ramsey sentence and Carnap sentence can indeed achieve this neutral position. To see this, however, we need to see why the Newman problem raised in the context of recent work on structural realism is no problem for Carnap’s conception; and we also need to locate Carnap’s work on theoretical terms within his wider program of Wissenschaftslogik or the logic of science. Carnap’s distinctive approach to theoretical terms dates from beginnings of his semantic period in the years following the publication <b>of</b> The <b>Logical</b> <b>Syntax</b> <b>of</b> Language (1934). Particularly important, in this context, is his monograph Foundations of Logic and Mathematics (1939), where the partial interpretation view of theoretical terms first emerges. This view is further articulated in “The Methodological Character of Theoretical Concepts ” (1956), and it is then connected with Carnap’s use of the Ramsey sentence in “Beobachtungssprache und Theoretische Sprache ” (1958) —through the mediation, as Stathis Psillos first documented, of Hempel’s “The Theoretician’s Dilemma ” (1958). i Carnap continued to work on the Ramsey sentence representation of theories (and the closely related representation using Hilbert’s ε-operator) throughout the 2 late 1950 s and early 1960 s, culminating in Philosophical Foundations of Physics in 196...|$|R
40|$|The {{starting}} point of this research essay is a critical review of two methods to conduct a quantitative analysis of information systems security risks: 1) Management of Risk: Guidance for Practitioners and 2) a cost model based on annual loss expectancy. We are focusing on these methods with a perspective that highlights the limits of both empiricism and the theoretical elements that underlie them. From an epistemological point of view we have considered the <b>logical</b> <b>syntax</b> <b>of</b> the two models, the semantics included in statements and the pragmatics of the scientific discourse: the use of models to demonstrate the risk assessment thesis, {{to solve the problems}} of risks in the human judgment versus mathematical calculus controversy. The major issues that we are discussing in this article imply various perspectives on scientific criteria, the choice among various theories and the structuring of problems proposed to be solved. We argue that the models that have been developed so far, the top-down approach (which involves well defined and well understood rules), as well as the demonstrations based on the induction method, cannot be applied in a lot of scenarios, because information systems, considered as a complex whole made up of various components, is primarily not a positivistic science solely described by mathematics.

40|$|In {{broadest}} terms, {{this thesis}} is concerned {{to answer the}} question of whether the view that arithmetic is analytic can be maintained consistently. Lest there be much suspense, I will conclude that it can. Those who disagree claim that accounts which defend the analyticity of arithmetic are either unable to give a satisfactory account of the foundations of mathematics due to the incompleteness theorems, or, if steps are taken to mitigate incompleteness, then the view loses the ability to account for the applicability of mathematics in the sciences. I will show that this criticism is not successful against every view whereby arithmetic is analytic by showing that the brand of "conventionalism" about mathematics that Rudolf Carnap advocated in the 1930 s, especially in <b>Logical</b> <b>Syntax</b> <b>of</b> Language, does not suffer from these difficulties. There, Carnap develops an account of logic and mathematics that ensures the analyticity of both. It is based on his famous "Principle of Tolerance", and so the major focus of this thesis will to defend this principle from certain criticisms that have arisen in the 80 years since the book was published. I claim that these criticisms all share certain misunderstandings of the principle, and, because my diagnosis of the critiques is that they misunderstand Carnap, the defense I will give is of a primarily historical and exegetical nature. Again speaking broadly, the defense will be split into two parts: one primarily historical and the other argumentative. The historical section concerns the development of Carnap's views on logic and mathematics, from their beginnings in Frege's lectures up through the publication <b>of</b> <b>Logical</b> <b>Syntax.</b> Though this material is well-trod ground, it is necessary background for the second part. In part two we shift gears, and leave aside the historical development of Carnap's views to examine a certain family of critiques of it. We focus on the version due to Kurt Gödel, but also explore four others found in the literature. In the final chapter, I develop a reading of Carnap's Principle - the `wide' reading. It is one whereby there are no antecedent constraints on the construction of linguistic frameworks. I argue that this reading of the principle resolves the purported problems. Though this thesis is not a vindication of Carnap's view of logic and mathematics tout court, it does show that the view has more plausibility than is commonly thought...|$|R
