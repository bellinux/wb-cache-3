However, direct downstream in vivo mediators in the TSLP-induced atopic immune cascade have not been identified. In our current study, we have shown that OX 40 ligand (OX 40 L) is a critical in vivo mediator of TSLP-mediated Th 2 responses. Treating mice with OX 40 <b>L-blocking</b> antibodies substantially inhibited immune responses induced by TSLP in the lung and skin, including Th 2 inflammatory cell infiltration, cytokine secretion, and IgE production.

40|$|International audienceThe {{mechanism}} {{underlying the}} local UVB-induced immunosuppression {{is a central}} issue to be clarified in photoimmunology. There have been reported {{a considerable number of}} cells and factors that participate in the sensitization phase-dependent suppression, including Langerhans cells (LCs), regulatory T cells, IL- 10, and TNF-alpha. The recent important finding that LC-depleted mice rather exhibit enhanced contact hypersensitivity responses urged us to re-evaluate the role of LCs along with dermal dendritic cells (dDCs) in the mechanism of UVB-induced immunosuppression. We studied the surface expression of OX 40 ligand (OX 40 L) and the intracellular expression of IL- 10 in LCs and dDCs from UVB-irradiated (300 mJ/cm(2)) skin of BALB/c mice and those migrating to the regional lymph nodes from UVB-irradiated, hapten-painted mice. In epidermal and dermal cell suspensions prepared from the UVB-irradiated skin, LCs expressed OX 40 L as well as CD 86 and produced IL- 10 at a higher level than Langerin(-) dDCs. The UVB-induced immunosuppression was attenuated by the administration of IL- 10 -neutralizing or OX 40 <b>L-blocking</b> Abs. In mice whose UVB-irradiated, hapten-painted skin was dissected 1 d after hapten application, the contact hypersensitivity response was restored, because this treatment allowed dDCs but not LCs to migrate to the draining lymph nodes. Moreover, LC-depleted mice by using Langerin-diphtheria toxin receptor-knocked-in mice showed impaired UVB-induced immunosuppression. These results suggest that IL- 10 -producing and OX 40 L-expressing LCs in the UVB-exposed skin are mandatory for the induction of Ag-specific regulatory T cells...|$|R

In {{the present study}} {{the role of the}} CD 95 death pathway in cisplatin sensitivity of TGCT cells was studied in Tera and its in vitro acquired cisplatin-resistant subclone Tera-CP. Cisplatin induced an increase in CD 95 membrane expression, which preceded the onset of apoptosis. Cisplatin-induced apoptosis was efficiently blocked by caspase- 8 inhibitor zIETD-fmk in Tera cells, but only partially in Tera-CP cells. In addition, cisplatin induced FADD and caspase- 8 recruitment to the CD 95 receptor in Tera cells, which was not noticed in Tera-CP cells. Moreover, overexpression of vFLIP reduced apoptosis induction by cisplatin in Tera cells. CD 95 <b>L-blocking</b> experiments revealed the involvement of CD 95 /CD 95 L interactions in cisplatin-induced apoptosis of Tera cells as well as cisplatin-sensitive 833 KE TGCT cells. Tera and 833 KE cells, treated with low doses of cisplatin, were sensitive for an apoptosis-inducing anti-CD 95 antibody. In contrast, CD 95 L blocking had no effect on cisplatin-induced apoptosis in Tera-CP or Scha, an intrinsic resistant TGCT cell line, nor did anti-CD 95 antibody induce additional apoptosis in cisplatin-treated Tera-CP or Scha cells. Taken together, these results show that (1) cisplatin sensitivity of TGCT cells is dependent on the activation of the CD 95 death pathway and (2) loss of cisplatin-induced activation of this CD 95 signaling pathway may result in resistance to cisplatin...|$|R

Until date, {{there is no clear}} picture available about the underlying mechanisms of ISB. In this study, we aimed to determine the changes in heart rate variability (HRV) parameters after ISB and the differences between right- and left-sided ISBs. Methods: We prospectively studied 24 patients operated for shoulder surgery in sitting position and divided them into two respective groups: R (right-sided block = 14 pts) and L (left-sided block = 10 pts). HRV data were taken before and 30 min after the block. Ropivacaine without ephedrine was used for the ISB through an insulated block needle connected to a nerve stimulator. Statistical analysis implemented chi-square, Student’s and t-paired tests. Skewed distributions were analyzed after logarithmic transformation. Results: All the studied patients had successful blocks. Horner’s syndrome signs were observed in 33. 3 % of the patients (R = 5 / 14, L = 3 / 10; [P = 0. 769]). There {{were no significant differences in}} pre-block HRV between the groups. The application of ISB had differential effect on HRV variables: R-blocks increased QRS and QTc durations and InPNN 50, while a statistical decrease was seen in InLF. <b>L-blocks</b> did not show any significant changes. These changes indicate a reduced sympathetic and an increased parasympathetic influence on the heart’s autonomic flow after R-block.

Due to strict delay requirements Shannon’s source-channel separation theorem becomes obsolete and the optimal performance requires a joint optimization {{of the source}} and channel variables. Our goal is to minimize the expected end-to-end distortion, particularly in the high SNR regime. The main figure of merit is the distortion exponent, the exponential decay rate of the expected distortion for high SNR. We provide an upper bound and lower bounds for the distortion exponent with respect to bandwidth ratio among the source and channel bandwidths. For achievability, we analyze three different strategies based on layered source coding concatenated with progressive, superposition or hybrid digital/analog transmission. In each case, by adjusting the system parameters we find the optimal distortion exponent {{as a function of}} the bandwidth ratio.

To three different parent diblock copolymers of poly(styrene) -b-poly(methacrylic acid) PS-b-PMAA multi-tail ammonium side-chains of (C 8) (2) -, (C 8) (4) -or (C 12) (2) -type were attached at various side-chain grafting densities (X), {{making it possible to}} separate effects of the details of the AC-block architecture from effects of the overall volume fraction of the AC block. The micro-segregated morphologies of these systems include AC-block filled spherical microdomains in a liquid-like state (SPHLL), AC-block filled hexagonally-packed cylinders (CYL), alternating lamellar microlayers of AC- and L-blocks (LAM) and <b>L-block</b> filled hexagonally-packed cylinders (CYL*). For systems with the same parent diblock copolymer that also carry a constant volume fraction of AC-blocks, an increase in the side-chain length (l(sc)) and/or in the number of alkyl tails at a side-chain branch point (m) result in a microdomain morphology that is either unchanged or changed into one with a less curved interface. For lamellae-forming L-b-AC ionic supramolecules made up of the same parent diblock copolymer, a body of experimental data showing small variations in the repeat distance of the LAM micro-segregated structure (d(LAM)) could be obtained by making appropriate combinations of X, lsc and m. For such lamellae-forming L-b-AC ionic supramolecules, the average of d(LAM) values decreases when l(sc) and/or m increase. For systems with (C 12) (2) -type side-chains, the effective Flory-Huggins interaction parameter between L-and AC-blocks chi'(C 12) (2) /X was determined at various side-chain grafting densities and it was observed that chi'(C 12) (2) /X increases when X is increased...|$|E
40|$|As one {{of model}} {{representation}} schemes, {{the usage of}} solid model has been started since the early 1970 s on representing correct engineering drawings. It is due to its characteristics that is unambiguous, complete and contains its own boundary. Since then, it becomes {{one of the important}} research fields and extensively used in many industries mostly in the areas of engineering design, architecture, and manufacturing. This thesis focused on two categories of research on solid model; reconstruction and representation. Since many researches are focused on reconstruction of multiple view images based on mathematical modeling and geometrical analysis, this research attempts to devise techniques or algorithms that are suitable for single view image and single sketch analysis. For that purpose, a new framework for solid model reconstruction and representation from given single view image in form of regular two-dimensional line drawing is presented. Affine transformation was used in the pre-processing stage of the framework that is in the data preparation and definition. The framework consists of neural network models for the reconstruction and the hybrid computing algorithm as representation scheme of the reconstructed solid. The reconstruction contains two categories namely deriving depth values and deriving hidden point while the representation is the combination of neural network and mathematical model. Four contributions presented in this thesis were a new framework for solid model reconstruction and representation, a new experimental data design in development of the neural network models, neural network models for solid model reconstruction, and hybrid algorithm in representing solid model. The neural network models and the hybrid algorithm have been tested and validated on three solid models namely cube, <b>L-block</b> and stair by using Matlab 7. 14 software. The framework can be used as an alternative on the development of a sketch interpreter. This is to avoid the use of mathematical modeling in the reconstruction process and to combine neural network and mathematical modeling in representing solid model...|$|E
