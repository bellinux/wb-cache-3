40|$|Glutamine {{synthetase}} was localized in nodules, roots, stems, {{and leaves}} of {{red kidney bean}} (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) by immunocytochemistry. Affinity purified antibodies reactive with glutamine synthetase were prepared using purified nodule-enhanced glutamine synthetase. Immunogold <b>labeling</b> <b>was</b> observed in the cell cytoplasm in each plant organ. In nodules, the <b>labeling</b> <b>was</b> more intense in the infected cells than in the uninfected cells. No <b>labeling</b> <b>was</b> observed in nodule bacteroids, peribacteroid spaces, or in peribacteroid membranes, while previous reports of glutamine synthetase immunolabeling of legume nodules showed labeling in the bacteroid fraction. Significant <b>labeling</b> <b>was</b> observed in nodule proplastids which contained starch granules. Substantial <b>labeling</b> <b>was</b> also observed in leaf chloroplasts. No <b>labeling</b> <b>was</b> observed in other organelles including mitochondria, peroxisomes, and endoplasmic reticulum. Preimmune IgGs did not bind to any structure in the tissues examined...|$|R

5|$|Key Sounds <b>Label</b> <b>is</b> a Japanese {{independent}} {{record label}} formed in 2001 as {{a brand of}} the publishing company VisualArt's. Key Sounds Label was formed to catalog and release music related to visual novels produced by the brand Key, also under VisualArt's, known for developing such titles as Kanon and Air. Excluding two albums and one single that were released by Key and VisualArt's before the label's formation, the majority of releases on the label all have a basis from one of Key's titles. There are other albums and singles on the label {{not directly related to}} the visual novels, such as two singles by Lia and one album by Riya. Unlike typical record labels, Key Sounds Label does not license any of the artists featured on albums and singles released on the label.|$|E
5|$|The Mikea are hunter-gatherers (also called foragers) who {{practice}} limited farming. The Mikea <b>label</b> <b>is</b> applied {{to those who}} live this subsistence lifestyle rather than being tied to a specific ethnicity. There are numerous groups termed Mikea along the west and southwest coast of Madagascar, with the majority living {{in and around the}} spiny Mikea Forest on the southwestern coast between Morombe and Toliara, an area extending 2500 square kilometers. Historically this main concentration of Mikea may have extended as far south as the Fiherenana River and as far north as the Mangoky River; another main cluster of Mikea live to the west and southwest of Lake Ihotry. They are typically considered a subset of the Sakalava ethnic group, although there are Mikea individuals who trace their origins to other ethnic groups. Their adherence to a way of life perceived by villagers and city dwellers as ancestral has contributed to a mystique and various myths and legends about them, and many Malagasy believe they are the descendents of Vazimba, the original inhabitants of the island, although {{there is no evidence to}} support this view. The majority of Malagasy believe the existence of the Mikea to be a myth and are unaware that any Malagasy continue to live the Mikea lifestyle to the present day. The term Mikea is principally used by outsiders to label this group and is not often used by members of this community themselves. Most Mikea prefer to call themselves either Vezo-Mikea or Masikoro-Mikea, depending on their specific family lineages.|$|E
