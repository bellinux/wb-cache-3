5|$|Waters Davis stipulated in his sale to Deering {{that the}} Cape Florida {{lighthouse}} be restored. Deering {{wrote to the}} U.S. government seeking specifications and guidelines for the lighthouse. Government officials were {{taken aback by the}} request, wondering how a federal lighthouse could have passed into private hands. An Act of Congress and two Executive Orders, in 1847 and 1897, had reserved the island for the federal lighthouse and for military purposes. Patient <b>legal</b> <b>work</b> eventually convinced the U.S. Congress and President Woodrow Wilson to agree to recognize Matheson's and Deering's ownership of Key Biscayne.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{resignation}} in 1926 to allow Margaret Bondfield {{to take a}} seat in Parliament, Hastings returned to {{his work as a}} barrister, and was even more successful than before his entry into the House of Commons. His cases included the Savidge Inquiry and the Royal Mail Case, and before his full retirement in 1948 {{he was one of the}} highest paid barristers at the English Bar. As well as his <b>legal</b> <b>work,</b> Hastings also tried his hand at writing plays. Although these had a mixed reception, The River was made into a silent film in 1927 named The Notorious Lady. Following strokes in 1948 and 1949, his activities became heavily restricted, and he died at home on 26 February 1952.|$|E

5|$|Geoffrey was {{a patron}} of scholarship, and {{employed}} scholars throughout his life, one of whom, Honorius of Kent, Geoffrey appointed Archdeacon of Richmond. Honorius was subsequently employed by Hubert Walter {{and wrote a}} <b>legal</b> <b>work</b> on canon law. The Leiden St Louis Psalter is a lavishly illuminated psalter made for the archbishop, probably in northern England in the 1190s, which passed {{into the hands of}} Blanche of Castile after Geoffrey's death, and, as religious manuscripts often were, was used to teach the future saint King Louis IX of France how to read, as recorded by a 14th-century inscription. After the king's death it passed through several royal owners, regarded as a relic of the saint, before reaching the University Library at Leiden in 1741.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the Supreme Court of Canada made {{a ruling}} in R.v. Butler which {{incorporated}} {{some elements of}} Dworkin and MacKinnon's <b>legal</b> <b>work</b> on pornography into the existing Canadian obscenity law. In Butler, the Court held that Canadian obscenity law violated Canadian citizens' rights to free speech under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms if enforced on grounds of morality or community standards of decency; but that obscenity law could be enforced constitutionally against some pornography {{on the basis of}} the Charter's guarantees of sex equality. The Court's decision cited extensively from briefs prepared by the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF), with the support and participation of Catharine MacKinnon.|$|E
5|$|In February 1761 Blackstone was {{considered}} as a potential Tory candidate for the rotten borough of Hindon in Wiltshire. After consultation with friends, he agreed to this prospect – {{at the same time}} refusing the offer of appointment as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. On 30 March 1761 he was returned for Hindon, and took his seat. This did not limit his <b>legal</b> <b>work,</b> initially, with the seat being given without a requirement to attend or vote in a particular way, and the grant of a patent of precedence at the same time actually increased the demand on his time. Court records show him pleading before Lord Mansfield in the Court of King's Bench soon after his election, and acting as counsel in Tonson v Collins, a copyright case, Thiquet v Bath, an important case on international law, and R v d'Eon, acting for the prosecution in a feud over Louis XV's newly appointed cross-dressing Ambassador to the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|The bulk of Moxon's <b>legal</b> <b>work</b> is Scientology-related. He {{has served}} as Commissioner of the Scientology-affiliated {{organization}} Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR).

He assisted 50 Scientologists in filing separate lawsuits against the organization Cult Awareness Network (CAN), which led to the bankruptcy of the organization.

5|$|Upon {{discharge}} from the NZEF, Hart resumed <b>legal</b> <b>work</b> in his Carterton practice. However, within a few months, he moved his family to Masterton and established a new law firm. He became involved with the charity organisation Rotary International {{and set up the}} Masterton chapter of Rotary in 1925. He maintained an association with the military; after an initial spell in the reserve of officers, he resumed his involvement with the Territorial Force and served as commander of the 2nd (Wellington) Infantry Brigade for several years. He was eventually returned to the reserve of officers in 1925. To acknowledge his long military career, he was awarded the Colonial Auxiliary Forces Officers' Decoration (VD) and appointed honorary colonel of his old Territorial Force unit, the Hawkes' Bay Regiment (formerly 17th (Ruahine) Regiment). He retired from the military in 1930.|$|E
5|$|Following {{news of his}} father's {{premature}} death in 1864, Riel lost interest in the priesthood and he withdrew from the college in March 1865. For a time he continued his studies as a day student in the convent of the Grey Nuns, but was soon asked to leave following breaches of discipline. He remained in Montreal over a year, living {{at the home of}} his aunt, Lucie Riel. Impoverished by the death of his father, Riel took employment as a law clerk in the Montreal office of Rodolphe Laflamme. During this time he was involved in a failed romance with a young woman named Marie–Julie Guernon. This progressed to the point of Riel having signed a contract of marriage, but his fiancée's family opposed her involvement with a Métis, and the engagement was soon broken. Compounding this disappointment, Riel found <b>legal</b> <b>work</b> unpleasant, and by early 1866 he had resolved to leave Canada East. Some of his friends said later that he worked odd jobs in Chicago, Illinois, while staying with poet Louis-Honoré Fréchette, and wrote poems himself in the manner of Lamartine; also that he was then for a time employed as a clerk in Saint Paul, Minnesota, before returning to the Red River Settlement on 26 July 1868.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} Reitz {{found it hard}} to make a living, as competition among lawyers in Cape Town was quite severe at this time. Nevertheless, he succeeded in making a name for himself, due to his sharp legal mind and his social intelligence. Being part of the western Circuit Court of the Cape Colony gave him a lot of experience in a very short time. At the same time, Reitz nurtured his political interests by writing lead articles for the Cape Argus newspaper, for which he also reported on the proceedings of the Cape Parliament and acted as deputy editor. In 1870 Reitz moved his legal practice to Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State. The discovery of diamonds {{on the banks of the}} Vaal River, Reitz thought, would lead to a growth of <b>legal</b> <b>work</b> and enable him to set up a thriving practice. This was not to be, however, and after a few months Reitz left Bloemfontein to set up as a diamond prospector in Griqualand West, where he bought a small claim near Pniel from the Berlin Missionary Society. This enterprise also proved unsuccessful, and again after only a few months Reitz returned to Cape Town. This time, his Cape Town law practice was successful, ironically because of the British annexation of the Orange Free State diamondfields (1871) and the economic prosperity this emanated for the Cape Colony.|$|E
5|$|O'Connor {{resigned}} from the Legislative Council on 16 July 1898, in order to contest the lower house seat of Young against the sitting Labour member, Chris Watson. He focused his campaign on Federation issues but was surprised to be easily defeated by 1,244 votes to 876. Financial difficulties necessitated his focus on <b>legal</b> <b>work</b> rather than campaigning during the second Constitution referendum in 1899, although he still managed to speak most nights. Following the success of Federation, O'Connor {{was to be a}} member of the first Commonwealth ministry, and was instrumental in the affair that became known as the Hopetoun Blunder. Lord Hopetoun, Australia's first Governor-General, had commissioned Sir William Lyne to form a government, since Lyne was Premier of the largest state, New South Wales. O'Connor was one of those who refused to serve under Lyne, who had been lukewarm on the issue during the Federation campaigns, and was significant in the negotiations that led to Lyne's resignation of the commission in Barton's favour. On 1 January 1901, O'Connor was appointed Vice-President of the Executive Council, an honorary post, in Barton's Cabinet.|$|E
5|$|The Leges {{was written}} between 1114 and 1118 {{by an unknown}} Norman, who is very {{likely to be the}} author of another <b>legal</b> <b>work,</b> the Quadripartitus, {{although}} some historians, including H. G. Richardson and G. O. Sayles, argue that the two works were by different authors. The Leges was probably part of a project including the Quadripartitus, the two works being part of a planned work in four volumes to cover not only the laws of the writer's own time, but previous laws of the Anglo-Saxon monarchs, as well as how to handle legal cases. As part of both works, the author has included the Charter of Liberties, which was King Henry's coronation charter promising not to follow the administrative and legal policies of his predecessor, King William II. About a third of the material in the Leges is also in the Quadripartitus. There is evidence that the author of the two works {{had been a member of}} the household of Gerard, who had been chancellor under Kings William I and William II before becoming Archbishop of York under Henry I. The work was likely composed at Winchester.|$|E
40|$|Cardinal Guillaume Dubois (1656 - 1723) rose to {{the apex}} of {{political}} and ecclesiastical power in Old Regime France. As Prime Minister, Archbishop and Cardinal, he played a decisive role in the consolidation of the peace treaties of Utrecht, Rastatt and Baden, ending the bloody 17 th century. Hyacinthe Rigaud, {{the most famous of}} French portrait painters, portrayed him with all symbols of his dual dignity. Four books stand out as repositories of legitimacy, including <b>legal</b> <b>works.</b> An analysis of the catalog of Dubois’ opulent personal library indicates that the cardinal and Prime Minister owned thousands of <b>legal</b> <b>works.</b> Rigaud’s use of the volumes is no coincidence...|$|R
