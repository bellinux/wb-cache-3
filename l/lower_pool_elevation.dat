40|$|The San Antonio River Authority (SARA) {{initiated}} {{a project to}} extend tour boat navigation approximately 7, 000 feet upstream on the San Antonio River. To make {{this section of the}} river navigable, a small dam and parallel lock system will be built to transfer vessels between <b>lower</b> <b>pool</b> <b>elevation</b> of 631. 2 feet and upper pool elevation of 640. 0 ft. The hydraulic locks must transfer tour boats quickly, efficiently, comfortably and safely using available river flow. A physical model study was required to verify and refine the operational suitability of the proposed side-port lock system. The model was constructed and studied at St. Anthony Falls Laboratory. The scope {{of the study was to}} build a physical model of one lock and its associated filling and emptying system and to test its operation on a scale model of the design vessel. The model was built at a scale of 1 : 8 and included a single lock chamber, a side-port gallery to convey water into and out of the lock chamber, and the upstream and downstream sluice gates. Two series of tests were conducted and at least one of the following parameters was modified during each test: The gate opening height, the gate opening duration, the gate opening as a function of time, the lock chamber floor level, and the loading of the vessel. For each test, headwater, tailwater, water surface level in the lock chamber and the opening rate of the sluice gate were recorded. The performance of the lock chamber was determined qualitatively by inspection of the vessel reaction and the flow patterns inside the gallery and the lock chamber. The second and more extensive series of tests were videotaped. HDR Engineering; San Antonio River Authorit...|$|E

From introduction: A {{test of the}} {{reservoir}} drawdown concept was completed in March, 1992, using Lower Granite and Little Goose Neck Dams (also known as 2 ̆ 2 projects 2 ̆ 2) on the lower Snake River. The test was designed to gather information regarding the effects of lowering existing reservoirs substantially to potentially improve survival of downstream-migrating juvenile salmon, as proposed by various entities in the Pacific Northwest. Since the hydroelectric projects on the lower Snake River are not currently equipped to safely pass adult and juvenile fish at the dams at <b>lowered</b> <b>pool</b> <b>elevations,</b> this test was primarily designed to provide information regarding the physical effects of such an operation on dam and reservoir structures. Information {{on a variety of}} physical features was gathered, and environmental data, including some effects of drawdown on water quality and aquatic organisms, were also obtained. Some anadromous fish were present in {{the reservoir}}s during March, so efforts were also made to minimize test impacts on these and to gather information that will help evaluate the long-term effects of reservoir drawdown. This report presents: (1) background material on the salmon runs and the effects of dam operations, (2) what was accomplished during the drawdown test, including implementation procedures, (3) monitoring and evaluation objectives and procedures, and (4) results...|$|R

40|$|Vernal pools, also termed {{temporary}} wetlands, promote key {{ecosystem services}} such as floodwater retention and provide unique habitat for many organisms. Despite their ecological value, vernal pools are declining worldwide because of habitat loss and encroachment of non-native species. Because vernal pool obligate plant species are strongly influenced by variation in annual precipitation that fills the pools, climate change and alterations in precipitation regimes can drastically alter these fragile communities. To understand how annual variation in precipitation and temperature affect vernal pool plant community composition, I examined long-term vegetation data for constructed vernal pools on Travis Air Force Base in Solano Co. CA. I used native and non-native plant frequencies collected over a 10 year period to explore the dynamics between species frequency and climate variability. I further analyzed fine-scale site topography to explore the effects spatial variability on ponding. I identified key differences between native and non-native plant species 2 ̆ 7 responses to climate variability and ponding. Over all, native species tend to respond positively to winter precipitation accumulations, but non-native species do not. Inundation appears {{to act as an}} ecological filter, preventing the establishment of non-native species. In addition, elevation seems to be a predictor of ponding [...] <b>lower</b> <b>elevation</b> <b>pools</b> tend to have greater pool depths, which can enhance the effects of the inundation filter. Together, these findings will assist management efforts in understanding the climatic and spatial factors that influence vernal pool restoration practices...|$|R
