40|$|Super cooling the {{cryogenic}} liquid propellant {{in a vehicle}} propellant tank densities the propellant allowing the vehicle propellant tank to carry more fuel in the same volume tank while lowering the vapor pressure and thus the tank operating pressure. Lowering the tank operating pressure reduces the stress and therefore allows {{the walls of the}} tank to be thinner. Both the smaller tank volume and thinner tank wall results in an overall smaller and lighter vehicle with increased payload capability. The cryogenic propellant can be supercooled well below the normal boiling point temperature level by transporting the liquid propellant from the vehicle tanks to a ground based cooling unit which utilizes a combination of heat exchanger and compressor. The compressor lowers the coolant fluid bath pressure resulting in a <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>boiling</b> liquid which is subsequently used to cool the recirculating liquid. The cooled propellant is then returned to the vehicle propellant tank. In addition to reducing the vehicle size and weight the invention also allows location of the vent valve on the ground, elimination of on-board recirculation pumps or bleed systems, smaller and lighter engine pumps and valves, lighter and more stable ullage gas, and significant reduction in tank fill operation. All of these mentioned attributes provide lower vehicle weight and cost...|$|E

We have studied the gettering ef-fectiveness, generation of dislocations and associated bulk lifetime degradation, {{and the impact of}} the BRL on the saturation current density, for different thickness of BRL and postoxidation condi-tions. Our results show that a BRL deposited using BBr 3 -based furnaces is very effective at gettering interstitial Fe, removing more than 99. 9 % of Fe, but that the gettered Fe is released back into the wafer when the BRL is oxidized thermally. While we have detected no significant bulk degradation due to dislocations for the diffusion conditions used, there remains a tradeoff between the gettering ef-fect and the recombination in the boron-doped region.

40|$|Attention {{is drawn}} {{to the degree of}} {{contamination}} of anaesthetic equipment and the responsibility resting upon anaesthetists for disinfecting all apparatus between cases. Possible methods of disinfection are briefly reviewed. Reasons of efficiency, conveni-ence, cost and practicability are given for suggesting that a domestic washing-up machine is the best form of disinfection so far devised. Although Ziegler and Jacoby (1956) suggested that corrugated tubing and reservoir bags may not be significantly contaminated with bacteria by patients, anaesthetists have become increas-ingly aware of the existence and dangers of such contamination of the equipment they use. The role played by this vehicle in postoperative in-fection has not yet been ascertained but it is now well known that ventilators used in inten-sive care can be responsible for both re-infection and cross-infection. An editorial on this matter (1964) leaves the reader in no doubt that the risk is real and that the anaesthetist must make it his duty to ensure that cross-infection will not occur. The editorial {{goes so far as to}} suggest that the same standards should be applied to the work of the anaesthetist as to that of the surgeon. Our interest in this problem was sharply stimulated by two recent outbreaks of post-operative chest infection which followed the opening of theatre suites. Before the introduction of the method of disinfection herein described, only the endotracheal tubes, connections and the pharyngeal airways received attention. These were thoroughly washed by hand, autoclaved and packaged. Laryngoscopes were washed under the tap by the theatre attendant.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. June 2010. Major: Mechanical Engineering Advisor: Francis A. Kulacki. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xix, 192 pages, appendices A-C. Although boiling in pure liquids {{has been studied}} thoroughly, boiling in other circumstances is less well understood. One area that has received little attention is boiling of dilute emulsions in which the dispersed component has a lower boiling point than the continuous component. These mixtures exhibit several surprising behaviors that were unknown until the 1970 's. Generally, boiling of the dispersed component enhances heat transfer {{over a wide range}} of surface temperatures without transition to film boiling, but a high degree of superheat is required to initiate boiling. In single-phase convection the dispersed component has little effect on heat transfer. These behaviors appear to occur in part because few droplets in the emulsion contact nucleation sites on the heated surface. No detailed and physically consistent model of boiling in dilute emulsions exists at present. The unusual behavior of boiling dilute emulsions makes them potentially useful for high heat flux cooling of electronics. High-power electronic devices must be maintained at temperatures below ~ 85 °C to operate reliably, even while generating heat fluxes of 100 W/cm 2 or more. Current research, generally focusing on single phase convection or flow boiling in small diameter channels, has not yet identified an adequate solution. An emulsion of refrigerant in water would be well-suited to this application. The emulsion retains the high specific heat and thermal conductivity of water, while boiling of the refrigerant enhances the heat transfer coefficient at temperatures below the saturation temperature of water. To better understand boiling dilute emulsions and expand the experimental database, an experimental study of boiling heat transfer from a horizontal heated wire, including visual observations, is performed. Emulsions of pentane in water and FC- 72 in water are studied. These emulsions have properties suitable for practical use in high heat flux cooling applications, unlike most emulsions that have previously been studied. The range of the experimental study is extended to include enhanced boiling of the continuous component, which has not previously been observed, in addition to boiling of the dispersed component. In both regimes the heat transfer coefficient is enhanced compared to that of water. Visual observations reveal the presence of large attached bubbles on the heated wire, the formation of which coincides with the inception of boiling in the heat transfer data. At very low dispersed component fractions and <b>low</b> <b>temperatures,</b> <b>boiling</b> of individual dispersed droplets is not observed. The large attached bubbles represent a new boiling mode that has not been reported in previous studies and is, under some circumstances, the dominant mode of boiling heat transfer. A model of boiling dilute emulsions is developed based upon the Euler-Euler model of multiphase flows. The general balance equations as developed by Drew and Passman are applied to the present situation, thus providing a rigorous and physically consistent framework. The model contains three phases that represent the continuous component, liquid droplets of the dispersed component, and bubbles that result from boiling of individual droplets. Mass, momentum, and energy transfer between the phases are modeled based upon the behavior of and interaction between individual elements of the dispersed phases. One-dimensional simulations of a single boiling droplet in superheated liquid are also performed, and the results are used to develop the closure equations of the larger model. Droplet boiling is assumed to occur when a droplet contacts a heated surface or a vapor bubble. Collisions between droplets and bubbles and chain-boiling of closely-spaced droplets are considered. The model is limited to the dispersed component boiling regime, and thus it does not account for phase change of the continuous component. The model also does not include the large attached bubbles revealed in the visualization experiments. However, simulations of boiling match several trends observed in the experimental data. The model thus provides a physically consistent and partially validated platform for future analytical and numerical work...|$|R

However, recovering the helium from the NG using conventional cryogenic distillation processes is expensive and energy intensive. We review the scope for improving the efficiency of the conventional helium recovery and upgrade processes, and evaluate the potential of emerging technologies based on adsorption or membrane separations for helium upgrade and purification.
