5|$|Although it is {{a federally}} {{designated}} park, fishing within Biscayne {{is governed by}} the state of Florida. Anglers in Biscayne are required to have a Florida recreational saltwater fishing license. Fishing is limited to designated sport fish, spiny <b>lobster,</b> stone crab, blue crab and shrimp. Tropical reef fish may not be collected, nor may sharks, conch, sea urchins and other marine life. Reef life species such as coral and sponges are also protected from collecting by visitors. Additionally, lobstering is prohibited in the Biscayne Bay-Card Sound <b>Lobster</b> Sanctuary, administered {{by the state of}} Florida to protect spiny <b>lobster</b> breeding areas, which overlaps much of Biscayne Bay.|$|E
5|$|Females {{can carry}} up to 680,000 eggs, which hatch after 10 weeks into flat phyllosoma larvae. These feed on {{plankton}} before the metamorphosis into the juvenile state. Adults are nocturnal and migratory, living among rocks at depths {{of up to}} , and feeding on sea urchins, clams, mussels and worms. The spiny <b>lobster</b> is eaten by various fish, octopuses and sea otters, but can defend itself with a loud noise produced by its antennae. The California spiny <b>lobster</b> {{is the subject of}} both commercial and recreational fishery in both Mexico and the United States, with sport fishermen using hoop nets and commercial fishermen using <b>lobster</b> traps.|$|E
5|$|North Island's primary {{human use}} is as a {{seasonal}} camp for Western Rock <b>Lobster</b> fishers. During <b>lobster</b> season, which runs from 15 March to 30 June, North Island's camp {{is occupied by}} about 130 fishers. The camp is serviced by a carrier boat, the North Islander, which visits the island every three days, bringing supplies and taking out the catch and any domestic waste.|$|E
25|$|Spiny <b>lobsters</b> tend {{to live in}} crevices {{of rocks}} and coral reefs, only {{occasionally}} venturing out at night to seek snails, clams, sea-hares, crabs, or sea urchins to eat. Sometimes, they migrate in very large groups in long files of <b>lobsters</b> across the sea floor. These lines {{may be more than}} 50 <b>lobsters</b> long. Spiny <b>lobsters</b> navigate using the smell and taste of natural substances in the water that change {{in different parts of the}} ocean. It was recently discovered that spiny <b>lobsters</b> can also navigate by detecting the Earth's magnetic field. They keep together by contact, using their long antennae. Potential predators may be deterred from eating spiny <b>lobsters</b> by a loud screech made by the antennae of the spiny <b>lobsters</b> rubbing against a smooth part of the exoskeleton. Spiny <b>lobsters</b> usually exhibit the social habit of being together. However recent studies indicate that healthy <b>lobsters</b> move away from infected ones, leaving the diseased <b>lobsters</b> to fend for themselves.|$|R
50|$|Reef <b>lobsters</b> are {{distinguished}} from clawed <b>lobsters</b> (family Nephropidae) by having full chelae (claws) {{only on the}} first pair of pereiopods, {{the second and third}} pairs being only subchelate (where the last segment of the appendage can press against a short projection from the penultimate one). Clawed <b>lobsters</b> have full claws on the first three pereiopods. Males, unlike those of nephropoid <b>lobsters,</b> have an extra lobe on the second pleopod, which is assumed to have some function in reproduction. Reef <b>lobsters</b> have a shallow cervical groove while clawed <b>lobsters</b> have a deep cervical groove.|$|R
50|$|Achelata {{contains}} the spiny <b>lobsters</b> (Palinuridae), the slipper <b>lobsters</b> (Scyllaridae) and the furry <b>lobsters</b> (Synaxidae, now usually included in Palinuridae), {{as well as}} two extinct families, Cancrinidae and Tricarinidae.|$|R
5|$|Publishing {{frequency}} <b>Lobster</b> {{dropped to}} four issues in 1984 and three issues in 1986 and 1987, before settling {{down as a}} bi-annual from 1988. The <b>Lobster</b> logo (see illustration), first appeared in issue 20 in November 1990 and was designed by Clive Gringras.|$|E
5|$|The first 8 {{issues of}} <b>Lobster</b> are A5 paper size (148 × 210mm) format, growing to A4 (210 × 297mm) from Issue 9 in September 1985. The {{magazine}} was originally typewritten, reduced on a photocopier, pasted-up and printed on a Gestetner off-set litho duplicating machine. Around issue 17, {{the magazine was}} type-set on an Amstrad PCW using Wordstream and from <b>Lobster</b> 27, on an AppleMac with Claris Works. <b>Lobster</b> Issue 57 (Summer 2009) was the last hard copy issue. Issue 58 (Winter 2009/2010) was the first available without charge. The magazine is published from Ramsay's home in Hull.|$|E

50|$|The {{most recent}} Boston <b>Lobsters</b> were a reincarnation of two {{previous}} WTT teams. The original <b>Lobsters</b> were a charter {{member of the}} league in 1974, and folded after just one season. The second <b>Lobsters</b> team were also a charter member of WTT in 1974, founded as the Philadelphia Freedoms. After the original <b>Lobsters</b> folded, Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, purchased the Freedoms and moved them to Boston renaming them the <b>Lobsters.</b> The second <b>Lobsters</b> team played in Boston for four seasons (1975-1978) before folding {{at the end of}} the 1978 season. WTT suspended operations shortly thereafter.|$|R
50|$|In 1975, the reincarnated <b>Lobsters</b> {{presented}} {{themselves as}} {{a continuation of the}} original <b>Lobsters</b> that folded after the 1974 season in promotional materials and media guides, since they had paid for that privilege. The team ignored any connection with its actual history as the Freedoms. The <b>Lobsters</b> also adopted the team logo of the original <b>Lobsters.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Lobster</b> {{published}} the first {{account of the}} Colin Wallace affair, also known as Operation Clockwork Orange, about the plot by disaffected members of Britain's Security Service, MI5, to destabilise the Harold Wilson Labour Government, and to smear politicians such as former Tory prime minister Edward Heath. The editors of <b>Lobster</b> described the revelations as Britain's Watergate and the biggest story since World War Two. The relevations were subsequently confirmed by former MI5 officer Peter Wright in his book Spycatcher.|$|E
5|$|Natural predators of the California spiny <b>lobster</b> include bony fish {{such as the}} California sheephead, giant {{sea bass}} and cabezone, sharks {{including}} the horn shark and leopard shark, octopuses and sea otters. In response to an approaching predator, spiny lobsters including the California spiny <b>lobster</b> can produce a loud noise using the stick-slip phenomenon, akin to a bowed instrument. The bases of the antennae act as a plectrum, which is rubbed over a file {{on the edge of}} the antennular plate. If a predator is very close, spiny lobsters will flex their muscular tail in order to escape the predator, backwards.|$|E

40|$|The natural diet of 506 American <b>lobsters</b> (Homarus americanus) {{ranging from}} instar V (4 mm {{cephalothorax}} length, CL) to the adult stage (112 mm CL) {{was determined by}} stomach content analysis for a site in the Magdalen Islands, Gulf of St. Lawrence, eastern Canada. Cluster and factor analyses determined four size groupings of <b>lobsters</b> based on their diet: < 7. 5 mm, 7. 5 to < 22. 5 mm, 22. 5 to < 62. 5 mm, and ≥ 62. 5 mm CL. The ontogenetic shift in diet with increasing size of <b>lobsters</b> was especially apparent for the three dominant food items: the contribution of bivalves and animal tissue (flesh) to volume of stomach contents decreased from the smallest <b>lobsters</b> (28 % and 39 %, respectively) to the largest <b>lobsters</b> (2 % and 11 %, respectively), whereas the reverse trend was seen for rock crab Cancer irroratus (7 % in smallest <b>lobsters</b> to 53 % in largest <b>lobsters).</b> Large <b>lobsters</b> also ate larger rock crabs than did small <b>lobsters...</b>|$|R
50|$|Nephropoidea is a {{superfamily}} of decapod crustaceans. It {{contains the}} true <b>lobsters</b> in the Nephropidae (including the rare thaumastochelid <b>lobsters),</b> and three fossil families: Chilenophoberidae, Protastacidae and Stenochiridae.

25|$|Slipper <b>lobsters</b> are {{a family}} (Scyllaridae) of about 90 species of achelate crustaceans, in the Decapoda Reptantia, {{found in all}} warm oceans and seas. They are not true <b>lobsters,</b> but are {{more closely related to}} spiny <b>lobsters</b> and furry <b>lobsters.</b> Slipper <b>lobsters</b> are {{instantly}} recognisable by their enlarged antennae, which project forward from the head as wide plates. All the species are edible, and some, such as the Moreton Bay bug and the Balmain bug (Ibacus peronii) are of commercial importance.|$|R

5|$|The California spiny <b>lobster</b> can be {{differentiated}} {{from the}} other species in the genus by the interrupted grooves across the abdomen; other species either lack grooves, or have grooves which span the entire body segment.|$|E
5|$|The California spiny <b>lobster</b> {{is found}} {{in parts of the}} Gulf of California, and along the Pacific coast of the length of the Baja California peninsula, {{extending}} as far north as San Luis Obispo Bay, California. There are occasional records from Monterey Bay, but the water there is too cold for the California spiny <b>lobster</b> to breed, and it is thought that any adult found in Central California arrived as a larva during El Niño years.|$|E
40|$|Direct animal {{behavior}} can be inferred from the fossil record only in exceptional circumstances. The exceptional mode of preservation of ammonoid shells in the Posidonia Shale (Lower Jurassic, lower Toarcian) of Dotternhausen in southern Germany, with only the organic periostracum preserved, provides an excellent opportunity to observe {{the contents of the}} ammonoid body chamber because this periostracum is translucent. Here, we report upon three delicate <b>lobsters</b> preserved within a compressed ammonoid specimen of Harpoceras falciferum. We attempt to explain this gregarious behavior. The three <b>lobsters</b> were studied using standard microscopy under low angle light. The <b>lobsters</b> belong to the extinct family of the Eryonidae; further identification was not possible. The organic material of the three small <b>lobsters</b> is preserved more than halfway into the ammonoid body chamber. The <b>lobsters</b> are closely spaced and are positioned with their tails oriented toward each other. The specimens are interpreted to represent corpses rather than molts. The <b>lobsters</b> probably sought shelter in preparation for molting or against predators such as fish that were present in Dotternhausen. Alternatively, the soft tissue of the ammonoid may have been a source of food that attracted the <b>lobsters,</b> or it may have served as a longterm residency for the <b>lobsters</b> (inquilinism). The <b>lobsters</b> represent the oldest known example of gregariousness amongst <b>lobsters</b> and decapods in the fossil record. Gregarious behavior in <b>lobsters,</b> also known for extant <b>lobsters,</b> thus developed earlier in earth’s history than previously known. Moreover, {{this is one of the}} oldest known examples of decapod crustacean...|$|R
50|$|Paramoeba Parasite is a {{parasite}} that attacks {{the nervous system}} of <b>lobsters.</b> Lately, <b>lobsters</b> that have been pulled up in Western LIS have been dead with the parasite. Also, it caused almost all {{the deaths of the}} <b>lobsters</b> in 1999.|$|R
25|$|<b>Lobsters</b> are {{invertebrates}} {{with a hard}} protective exoskeleton. Like most arthropods, <b>lobsters</b> must moult to grow, {{which leaves}} them vulnerable. During the moulting process, several species change colour. <b>Lobsters</b> have 10 walking legs; the front three pairs bear claws, {{the first of which}} are larger than the others. Although <b>lobsters</b> are largely bilaterally symmetrical like most other arthropods, some genera possess unequal, specialised claws.|$|R
5|$|The California spiny <b>lobster</b> {{is one of}} 19 {{species in}} the genus Panulirus, {{which is one of}} several genera of spiny {{lobsters}} whose names are anagrams of the original spiny <b>lobster</b> genus, Palinurus. Its closest relatives are not the other species that occur in the East Pacific, but rather Panulirus argus from the Caribbean Sea and West Pacific species such as Panulirus japonicus, Panulirus marginatus, Panulirus pascuensis, Panulirus cygnus and Panulirus longipes; this relationship has been recovered from comparative studies of adult and larval morphology, as well as from molecular phylogenetics, using the sequences from cytochrome c oxidase and 16S ribosomal RNA genes.|$|E

5|$|With {{the arrival}} of English {{soldiers}} by ship, and naval battles on the seas, areas used for salt water fishing became perilous, and lay dormant {{for much of the}} war. In addition, many of the fishing vessels were converted into warships. Before the war, there was often talk about the excess of lobsters and cod off the shores of New England. This seemed to change during and after the war, due to the vast numbers of ships and artillery entering the ocean waters. Once <b>lobster</b> harvesting and cod fishing was reestablished, most fishermen found that the <b>lobster</b> and cod had migrated away from the shores.|$|E
