5|$|Elwell {{advanced}} inland {{rapidly and}} was soon also engaged, losing one killed and two wounded in a brief skirmish. During the advance the Australians had also uncovered and defused a large pipe mine the Germans had buried under a narrow track and set to detonate using a command wire. These mines had been laid beneath the road with wires leading to an electric battery and a firing key {{at the bottom of}} a lookout tree. By 13:00 however, Hill's position was reached and the Australians—now under Elwell's overall command—launched another flanking attack on the main trench blocking the road. Despite suffering heavy casualties they pressed their attack, forcing the defenders to surrender after charging the trench with fixed bayonets. A German officer and 20Melanesians were captured. Four Australians were killed, including Elwell who died <b>leading</b> <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> with his sword drawn, and another five were wounded.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of August 15 the Russian forces resumed their attacks on the Polish lines, {{intending}} to break through the second line of defences to the area of Nieporęt and Jabłonna. However, as they bypassed a small forest outside Wólka Radzymińska, they were assaulted from the rear by the 1st Battalion of the 28th Infantry Regiment, which had been concealed there earlier. Simultaneously, the remainder of the 28th Regiment began a badly coordinated and half-hearted attack from Nieporęt. Both Polish assaults were bloodily repelled, with the casualties including Lieutenant Pogonowski who was posthumously awarded the Virtuti Militari medal for his bravery <b>leading</b> <b>the</b> <b>charge,</b> but they did force the Russians to retreat to their initial positions.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1142 Stephen fell ill, and by Easter rumours had begun to circulate that he had died. Possibly this illness {{was the result of}} his imprisonment the previous year, but he finally recovered and travelled north to raise new forces and to successfully convince Ranulf of Chester to change sides once again. Stephen then spent the summer attacking some of the new Angevin castles built the previous year, including Cirencester, Bampton and Wareham. In September, he spotted an opportunity to seize the Empress Matilda herself in Oxford. Oxford was a secure town, protected by walls and the river Isis, but Stephen led a sudden attack across the river, <b>leading</b> <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> and swimming part of the way. Once on the other side, the King and his men stormed into the town, trapping the Empress in the castle. Oxford Castle, however, was a powerful fortress and, rather than storming it, Stephen had to settle down for a long siege, albeit secure in the knowledge that Matilda was now surrounded. Just before Christmas, the Empress left the castle unobserved, crossed the icy river on foot and made her escape to Wallingford. The garrison surrendered shortly afterwards, but Stephen had lost an opportunity to capture his principal opponent.|$|E

Ultimately, over 8,600 Canadians volunteered to fight. Lieutenant Harold Lothrop Borden, however, became the most famous Canadian casualty of the Second Boer War. About 7,400 Canadians, including many female nurses, served in South Africa. Of these, 224 died, 252 were wounded, and several were decorated with the Victoria Cross. Canadian forces also participated in the British-led concentration camp programs that resulted in the deaths of thousands of Boer civilians.|$|E
40|$|The {{growth and}} {{development}} of "charged particle jets" produced in proton-antiproton collisions at 1. 8 TeV are studied over a transverse momentum range from 0. 5 GeV/c to 50 GeV/c. A variety of leading (highest transverse momentum) charged jet observables are compared with the QCD Monte Carlo models HERWIG, ISAJET, and PYTHIA. The models describe fairly well the multiplicity distribution of <b>charged</b> particles within <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>charged</b> jet, <b>the</b> size of <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>charged</b> jet, <b>the</b> radial distribution of charged particles and transverse momentum around <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>charged</b> jet direction, and the momentum distribution of <b>charged</b> particles within <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>charged</b> jet. <b>The</b> direction of <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> "charged particle jet" in each event is used to define three regions of eta-phi space. The "toward" region contains <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> "charged particle jet," while the "away" region, on the average, contains the away-side jet.

25|$|On 15 July 1811, Boussart {{commanded}} 1,876 cavalrymen {{in three}} regiments. In September, his command numbered 2,405 in 14 squadrons. In late summer, Suchet launched {{an invasion of}} the province of Valencia, arriving before the ancient fortress of Saguntum (Sagunto) on 23 September 1811. After the garrison repelled two French assaults, a relief army of Joaquín Blake y Joyes appeared and the two sides clashed in the Battle of Saguntum on 25 October. While the French dispersed Blake's left flank rather easily, the fighting {{in the center and}} right of the Spanish line was much tougher. Early in the action, Suchet committed three squadrons of cavalry to retake some ground. Soon afterward, the Spanish cavalry overran a French battery and Suchet sent in 350 troopers of the 13th Cuirassiers. <b>Leading</b> <b>the</b> <b>charge,</b> Boussart scattered the Spanish horsemen and recaptured the guns. Hewing a path through their opponents, the armor-clad heavy cavalrymen captured a Spanish artillery battery before their impetus was spent. When Suchet ordered the 24th Dragoons to attack, the rout of Blake's army became general. For a loss of 1,000 casualties, the French inflicted 6,000 killed and wounded on the Spanish, not counting several hundred prisoners. The 2,500-man Saguntum garrison, disheartened by the spectacle, capitulated the next day.|$|E

North Carolina {{controlled}} the first half by outscoring Duke in the paint 32-10, with North Carolina's Kennedy Meeks <b>leading</b> <b>the</b> <b>charge.</b> North Carolina led by as many as 13 points and threatened to turn the game into a blowout, but Duke's Grayson Allen made four 3-pointers to get Duke within 7 points at the half, with North Carolina leading 49-42. In the second half, with North Carolina leading Duke 56-48 with 15:04 left, North Carolina's Joel Berry II picked up his fourth foul, which forced North Carolina to take him out of the game. Though North Carolina led by 13 points at 61-48 with 13:53 remaining, Duke used a 20-4 run over the next five minutes, thanks to steals and three-pointers from Duke's Jayson Tatum and Luke Kennard, to put Duke up 68-65 over North Carolina with 8:24 left.

However, he did not receive any support from the other batsmen and despite his tons, Zimbabwe lost both the games. In the final ODI, chasing a sizable 329 to win, Taylor set {{the tone of the}} chase with a brisk 75 off 65 balls, which enabled Malcolm Waller and Elton Chigumbura to give Zimbabwe a famous win. With 310 runs in the series at an average of 310.00 and a strike rate of over 100, Taylor was adjudged the Man of the Series. His 310 runs is also a record number of runs in a three-match ODI series. He scored 50 and 117 in the one off test match. By the process, Taylor became only the second Zimbabwean batsman after Kevin Arnott to score a century in the fourth innings of a Test match, and contained 5 huge sixes. Despite his half-century and his second Test cricket ton, New Zealand outlasted him to win a thrilling match. Despite that, Taylor said that his team will continue to play aggressive, attacking test cricket which drew widespread praise from all quarters.
