25|$|In 1966, due to uneven {{scheduling}} {{that left}} out new AAWU members Oregon and Oregon State, UCLA was 3–1 in conference games and 8-1 overall. The Bruins lost only one game, at Washington 16–3. USC was 5–0, but lost out of conference to Miami (Florida). It was widely {{assumed that the}} winner of the 1966 game between 8th ranked UCLA and 7th ranked USC would go to the 1967 Rose Bowl. UCLA star QB Gary Beban was out with a broken ankle, but backup Norman Dow, making his first and only start at QB, led UCLA to a 14–7 win. A vote the next Monday among the AAWU conference athletic directors put USC in the Rose Bowl. It was speculated that this was to make up for 1964 when Oregon State (8-2 overall, 4-1 in conference) was voted in ahead of USC (7-3 overall, 4-1 in conference) despite USC's 20-17 upset of #1 Notre Dame in the season's final game; the Oregon State coach at the time was Tommy Prothro, who became UCLA's coach in 1965. In addition, the directors believed Beban could not play for UCLA in the Rose Bowl due to the broken ankle, thereby giving the Big 10 representative (Purdue) a better chance to win. UCLA students protested by blocking the Northbound lanes of I-405 at Wilshire Boulevard. A week after the vote, USC made the voters <b>look</b> <b>really</b> bad as they lost to Notre Dame 51–0. This still stands as the worst defeat in USC Trojan football history. USC entered the Rose Bowl unranked and lost to Purdue, 14–13. Ironically, Beban's ankle had healed and he could have played. UCLA finished fifth in both polls.|$|E

500|$|A sequel, , was {{released}} for the Game Boy in 1991 in North America, and in 1992 in Japan. It {{was the first}} game of the Metroid series whose North American release featured a save system, allowing the player to have three separate save files. Metroid II also established the current [...] "look" [...] of Samus Aran and her Power Suit, namely the bulky look of the Varia Suit upgrade and the visual difference between the [...] "Beam Mode" [...] and [...] "Missile Mode" [...] of Samus's arm cannon. Dan Owsen of Nintendo acknowledged in an interview that Nintendo R was involved in developing the Game Boy Color. He noted that Nintendo R included a special [...] "Metroid palette" [...] in the console's hardware, which [...] "makes Metroid II <b>look</b> <b>really,</b> really nice on Game Boy Color", remarking that this made the game's graphics comparable to the original Metroid.|$|E
500|$|Farrar {{settled on}} the {{preliminary}} look of the wave, and graphics supervisor Jay Riddle used Adobe Photoshop on a Macintosh to establish the final color scheme. Initially the team {{thought they would be}} able to use the same methods to create the wave that hits the Excelsior, but found that it did not convey the scale of the wave—in Riddle's words, [...] "this thing had to <b>look</b> <b>really</b> enormous." [...] The shot was created by manipulating two curved pieces of computer geometry, expanding them as they approached the camera's view. Textures that changed every frame were added to the main wave body and over the top of it to give the impression of great speed. Motion control footage of the Excelsior was then scanned into the computer system and made to interact with the digital wave. ILM's [...] "Praxis effect" [...] shockwave became a common feature in science fiction films depicting the destruction of large objects.|$|E
500|$|Indiewire's Max O'Connell criticised the church's {{approach}} for being counterproductive.

But then, they don't seem terribly aware that attacking everyone who criticizes you doesn't do a lot of good for your image." [...] Paul Haggis, who was labeled [...] "doughy" [...] and [...] "pasty" [...] by the church, likewise felt that the attacks were backfiring: [...] "You don't think that makes you <b>look</b> <b>really</b> bad trying to slander me in that way? I'm an imperfect human being. And I've made many, many mistakes in my life. So you can absolutely publicize any of those. But this, really, (you’re) thinking that makes you look good?" ...|$|E

500|$|The Game Boy's {{black-and-white}} graphics {{resulted in}} changes to Samus's gear that eventually became permanent. In the original Metroid, color {{was used to}} differentiate between Samus's Power Suit and her Varia Suitan upgraded version. However, without color on the Game Boy, the two suits would have appeared similar, requiring the developers to develop a visual indicator for players to determine which suit Samus is wearing. They also updated her Varia Suit, adding round metal shoulders that {{have been a part}} of the suit in every game in the series since then. Nintendo R was also involved in developing the Game Boy Color, a successor to the original Game Boy with a color screen. Nintendo of America's Dan Owsen noted that Nintendo R included a special [...] "Metroid palette" [...] in the Game Boy Color's hardware, which [...] "makes Metroid II <b>look</b> <b>really,</b> really nice on Game Boy Color", remarking that this made the game's graphics comparable to the original Metroid on the Nintendo Entertainment System.|$|E
500|$|April reveals her {{favorite}} band is Neutral Milk Hotel after she responds that Jeff Mangum, the band's vocalist and guitarist, is the rock star she was most attracted to. While going through Ann's wardrobe, Leslie finds the outfit Julia Roberts wears in the 1990 romantic comedy Pretty Woman, {{in which she}} plays a prostitute; Ann claims to <b>look</b> <b>really</b> good in it. While explaining that everybody steals ideas from other people, Tom points out the 2003 comedy film Love Don't Cost a Thing {{is based on the}} 1987 comedy film Can't Buy Me Love. He then falsely claims that film was based on the 1979 drama film Kramer vs. Kramer, which he incorrectly believes was written by the English poet and playwright William Shakespeare. One of the boring conversation topics Leslie brings up to reduce the sexual tension with Ben is the dormitory buildings at Johns Hopkins University, a university in Baltimore, Maryland. Acting against this Ann also [...] "Snuck in an Al Green song", which starts similarly to his song [...] "Let's Stay Together." ...|$|E
500|$|Auditions {{were held}} {{for the role of}} Becky which {{required}} the auditionee to look deliberately scruffy.

So I sat on the Tube putting grease in my hair and wiping my make-up off with everyone looking at me. By the time I got there I looked a right state!". Kelly was initially only cast for a three-month period when she began filming in 2006, but impressed producers and was offered an extended contract as a regular character. On 17 June 2008, after further impressing the producers, Kelly was signed for an additional 12 months. In February 2009, Kelly again had her contract extended, securing her role in the soap until August 2011. However, in 2010 Kelly was signed to a new 18-month contract by new producer Phil Collinson, a contract which was described as [...] "unprecedented" [...] at the time.|$|E

I loved Cristina's Stepford wife joke and how everyone, {{including}} Derek, couldn't help but stare at her hair. Yet, no one had the balls to tell her it was bad." [...] Pascua also enjoyed Leigh's performance as Lexie, commenting: [...] "This was one episode I felt that Lexie was a genuine character. She still maintained that book-smart ability to repeat facts (like the merger cases) and shows a command of medical situations." [...] He too found Oh's bear voice comical, adding: [...] "I laughed when Cristina attempted to do her voice for Mr. Bear because you knew that she didn't {{know what she was}} doing." [...] Pascua was shocked with the departure of Utterbacks' character, writing: [...] "I can't believe that they cut Nurse Olivia. I understand that she wasn't really around, but having her as a tertiary character was nice. It was kind of ass-y of the chief not to personally tell these people that they were being cut, but it made Derek <b>look</b> <b>really</b> chivalrous." ...|$|E

500|$|Media {{portrayals of}} Naomi Watts' and Laura Elena Harring's views of their onscreen {{relationships}} were varied and conflicting. Watts {{said of the}} filming of the scene, [...] "I don't see it as erotic, though maybe it plays that way. The last time I saw it, I actually had {{tears in my eyes}} because I knew where the story was going. It broke my heart a little bit." [...] However, in another interview Watts stated, [...] "I was amazed how honest and real all this looks on screen. These girls <b>look</b> <b>really</b> in love and it was curiously erotic." [...] While Harring was quoted saying, [...] "The love scene just happened in my eyes. Rita's very grateful for the help Betty's given [...] so I'm saying goodbye and goodnight to her, thank you, {{from the bottom of my}} heart, I kiss her and then there's just an energy that takes us [...] Of course I have amnesia so I don't know if I've done it before, but I don't think we're really lesbians." [...] Heather Love agreed somewhat with Harring's perception when she stated that identity in Mulholland Drive is not as important as desire: [...] "who we are does not count for much—what matters instead is what we are about to do, what we want to do." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{scientist}} {{studying the}} Kaiju. Day stated: [...] "Certainly myself and Burn Gorman provide {{a little bit}} of much needed levity, it's a break from the monsters and the guys fighting. But then the character gets thrust into the story in a way that his life is seriously at risk and it becomes a little more action oriented and a little more horror movie-esque. So, he kinda bounces back between being humorous and also being real… the rest of these guys, they <b>look</b> <b>really</b> good in their suits and they've got abs, they can kick and fight and punch. Newt is sort of the 'everyman' and he's flawed and he's arrogant." [...] Del Toro gave Geiszler the mentality of a celebrity chef, with tattoos and a [...] "big personality". According to the director, Day was cast based on his performance in an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: [...] "He comes out with a stick, and he has a monologue about what it is to hunt the rats in the basement. It was very funny, but he was coming from character. He was not doing big stuff, he was, like, really mourning and lamenting his job, you know, how inhuman it is. And I thought, 'This guy is great at shading and comedy.' There are moments in the movie where he delivers them both." [...] Trek Buccino portrays Geiszler as a child.|$|E
500|$|The game's visuals were {{considered}} its strongest feature. Allgame's Shawn Sackenheim praised the [...] "vibrant texture maps" [...] with [...] "no pop-up or glitching", while Kelly of Electronic Gaming Monthly made {{note of the}} [...] "lush" [...] environmental details. Kelly and Sega Saturn Magazines Lee Nutter highlighted the consistent framerate (which rarely dropped below 30 frames per second) as a noteworthy achievement, with the latter favourably comparing Sonic R to the Saturn version of Sega Rally Championship. Next Generation hailed the game as [...] "the most visually outstanding Saturn title" [...] for its use of transparency effects and reflective surfaces, a sentiment echoed by EGMs Shawn. Nutter cited the [...] "Radiant Emerald" [...] level, which is [...] "constructed entirely out of transparent polygons", as offering a [...] "far superior" [...] counterpart to Mario Kart 64s [...] "Rainbow Road". GameSpot's Ryan MacDonald stated that the [...] "cartoon {{look and feel of}} previous Sonic games comes across well in the 3D polygonal world", adding: [...] "The sense of speed that you feel as the track goes zipping by... makes the game <b>look</b> <b>really</b> cool." [...] MacDonald, Shawn, and GamePros Dan Elektro criticised the background's graphical [...] "pop-up", with the latter opining that it [...] "kill the two-player mode outright". However, Nutter praised the two-player mode for maintaining the same speed and graphical detail as its single-player counterpart, with [...] "the only visible difference being that the scenery mists into view slightly closer than in the standard game". Reiner of Game Informer asserted that [...] "the way they hid the background pop through translucent melting is innovative", but he and Game Informers Paul panned the [...] "poor" [...] quality of the character animation. Finally, Nutter complimented the replay mode's [...] "dramatic camera angles".|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} make a {{faithful}} rendition of the circus, director Kramer asked the animators to watch a showing of Cirque du Soleil in Santa Monica, but they declined the offer. Regardless, executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully found that the animators did an [...] "amazing" [...] job animating the setpiece. Because the episode takes place in winter, the animators faced some challenges that they would not have with any other episode. [...] "It just adds another element", Kramer said about episodes taking place in winter, [...] "People's clothes have to get tugged in the wind if it's windy. And {{you have to make sure}} the snow is consistent because [...] It's like a character. If it's a big snowflake in one scene and then tiny ones where it's snowing too hard in the next scene... It's not gonna work." [...] The scratches and bad quality of [...] "The Christmas That Almost Wasn't, But Then Was" [...] were added in by the Post-Production Department, led by Alex Duke. [...] "Our Post-Production Department never gets enough credit," [...] Scully said, [...] "But they'll take a film like [...] and make it all scratchy and make it <b>look</b> <b>really</b> old. They always do a great job." [...] The woman in [...] "The Christmas That Almost Wasn't, But Then Was" [...] was portrayed by Tress MacNeille, while the clown in the Cirque du Purée was voiced by Hank Azaria.
