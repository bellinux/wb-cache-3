5|$|A {{few days}} after the Muslims encamped at the Yarmouk plain, the Byzantine army, preceded by the <b>lightly</b> armed Ghassanids of Jabalah, moved forward and {{established}} strongly fortified camps just north of the Wadi-ur-Ruqqad.|$|E
5|$|In late July 636, Vahan sent Jabalah {{with his}} <b>lightly</b> armored Christian Arab forces to reconnoiter-in-force, {{but they were}} repulsed by the mobile guard. After this skirmish, no {{engagement}} occurred for a month.|$|E
5|$|Jabalah's <b>lightly</b> armed Christian Arabs would {{march to}} Emesa from Aleppo via Hama {{and hold the}} main Muslim army at Emesa.|$|E
5|$|John Smiths Golden Ale (4% ABV). Available {{in a can}} only, a <b>lightly</b> hopped pale ale.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lightly</b> calcified darts {{occur in}} the snail and semi-slug family Urocyclidae, within the {{superfamily}} Helicarionoidea.|$|E
5|$|Most historians agree Galileo {{did not act}} out of malice {{and felt}} blindsided by the {{reaction}} to his book. However, the Pope {{did not take the}} suspected public ridicule <b>lightly,</b> nor the Copernican advocacy.|$|E
5|$|Sugar cubes (sometimes called sugar lumps) {{are white}} or brown {{granulated}} sugars <b>lightly</b> steamed and pressed together in block shape. They {{are used to}} sweeten drinks.|$|E
5|$|The Roman forces totaled {{approximately}} 79,000 troops: 63,000 {{infantry and}} 6,000 cavalry, {{and in the}} two fortified camps another 2,600 heavily armed men and 7,400 <b>lightly</b> armed men.|$|E
5|$|The Sudan {{was very}} <b>lightly</b> administered. As late as 1919 {{there were just}} 17 British administrators in the Bahr al-Ghazal and Mongalla provinces, with a {{combined}} area twice that of Britain.|$|E
5|$|The duel {{took place}} in Indiana on January 19, 1809, just across the Ohio River from Shippingport, Kentucky. Joseph Hamilton Daveiss {{provided}} the pistols. On the first shot, Marshall missed and Clay <b>lightly</b> grazed Marshall's stomach. Marshall missed again on the second shot, and Clay's pistol misfired. Marshall's third shot <b>lightly</b> wounded Clay in the thigh, while Clay missed Marshall entirely. Clay insisted that the two each take another shot, but Marshall declined on grounds that Clay's injury put him on unequal footing with his adversary, and the matter was ended.|$|E
5|$|A wetland reserve {{has been}} created at Heron's Green Pool on the {{opposite}} side of the causeway to the lake. A shallow pool fringed with sedges (Cyperaceae), rushes (Juncaceae) and reedgrasses (Calamagrostis) and surrounded by <b>lightly</b> grazed, rough grassland may also prove attractive to snipe and lapwings.|$|E
5|$|Abuwtiyuw {{appears to}} have been a sighthound, a <b>lightly</b> built hunting dog similar to a greyhound, with erect ears and a curly tail. The tomb in which his tablet was {{discovered}} is in Cemetery G 2100 in Giza West Field, close to the western side of the Great Pyramid of Giza (Pyramid of Khufu/Kheops).|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the Warren Hill would have {{overlooked}} a large river valley that was to become the English Channel. Once the sea had inundated the surrounding valley, Mesolithic hunter gatherers exploited the site. Pollen analysis of peat from the Solent bed suggest a <b>lightly</b> wooded headland free of close-knit undergrowth during this period, an ideal habitat for game.|$|E
5|$|Because of Hurricane Katrina, the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center {{suffered}} {{a loss of}} water pressure and electricity, {{and one of its}} convention halls had a large hole in its ceiling. The center was otherwise only <b>lightly</b> damaged.|$|E
5|$|Directed by Felix E. Feist, {{the film}} {{served as a}} screen test for, and is the first {{significant}} screen appearance of, two young actresses who later became major stars, Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin. Although only <b>lightly</b> reviewed {{at the time of}} its release, the film has garnered a generally positive reputation among Garland biographers.|$|E
5|$|Following John V's death, Manuel II Palaeologus {{was able}} to secure his throne and {{establish}} {{good relations with the}} Sultan, becoming his vassal. In return for Ottoman acceptance of his reign Manuel II was forced to dismantle the fortifications at the Golden Gate, something that he did not take <b>lightly</b> to.|$|E
5|$|Gillian Jacobs as Britta Perry – Britta {{dropped out}} of high school because she thought it would impress Radiohead. She then joined a group of anarchists who vandalized billboards. She has been in the Peace Corps, and done foot {{modeling}} before she enrolled at Greendale. She is strongly concerned with honesty, and does not take <b>lightly</b> to anyone lying to her.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, {{secondary}} batteries {{were typically}} {{considered to be}} a combination of torpedo defense—defense against smaller boats armed with torpedoes, such as torpedo boats or destroyers—and weapons to attack the <b>lightly</b> armored upper structures of capital ships.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1918 Hines was {{discharged}} from the AIF as being medically unfit due to hemorrhoid problems. He arrived back in Australia on 19October 1918. While his Army service file records that he was <b>lightly</b> wounded on two occasions, Hines later {{claimed to have been}} wounded five times.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} summer of 214 BC, Philip again {{attempted}} an Illyrian invasion by sea, with a fleet of 120 lembi. He captured Oricum which was <b>lightly</b> defended, and sailing up the Aous (modern Vjosë) river he besieged Apollonia.|$|E
5|$|Nova Scotia was {{generally}} poorly defended {{in the early}} stages of the American Revolutionary War, and unrest in the eastern regions provoked fears of an American-led uprising. Although some reinforcements had reached Halifax by early 1776, the frontiers of the province were only <b>lightly</b> defended.|$|E
5|$|She was <b>lightly</b> {{damaged by}} a typhoon on 22 September 1912. Satsuma was {{assigned}} to the 1st Battleship Squadron when World War I began in August 1914. She served as Rear Admiral Tatsuo Matsumura's flagship in the Second South Seas Squadron as it seized the German possessions of the Caroline and the Palau Islands in October 1914.|$|E
5|$|The Arabs {{soldiers}} {{were far more}} <b>lightly</b> armored then their Roman and Persian contemporaries, which made them vulnerable in close combat at set-piece battles and to missile fire of enemy archers. Khalid therefore never blundered in the battle and would rely on intelligence reports from spies that he would hire from local population on liberal rewards.|$|E
5|$|The Chickasaw Turnpike {{has only}} two lanes for the {{majority}} of its length; however, there is a short eastbound passing lane. The Chickasaw is the only two-lane turnpike in Oklahoma. <b>Lightly</b> traveled, the road is used by about 2,000vehicles per day.|$|E
5|$|The {{main belt}} armour would {{normally}} taper {{to a lesser}} thickness {{along the side of}} the hull towards bow and stern; it might also taper up from the central citadel towards the superstructure. The deck was typically <b>lightly</b> armoured with 2 to 4inches of steel. This lighter armour was to prevent high-explosive shells from wrecking the superstructure of the ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{mourning}} dove occupies {{a wide variety}} of open and semi-open habitats, such as urban areas, farms, prairie, grassland, and <b>lightly</b> wooded areas. It avoids swamps and thick forest. The species has adapted well to areas altered by humans. They commonly nest in trees in cities or near farmsteads.|$|E
5|$|The only ships on {{the lake}} {{following}} the American retreat from Quebec were those of a small fleet of <b>lightly</b> armed ships that Benedict Arnold had assembled following the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775. This fleet, {{even if it had}} been in British hands, was too small to transport the large British army to Fort Ticonderoga.|$|E
5|$|Virginia headed {{directly}} for the Union squadron. The battle opened when Union tug Zouave fired on the advancing enemy, and Beaufort replied. This preliminary skirmishing had no effect. Virginia did not open fire {{until she was}} within easy range of Cumberland. Return fire from Cumberland and Congress bounced off the iron plates without penetrating, although later some of Cumberlands payload <b>lightly</b> damaged Virginia.|$|E
5|$|While Nagato {{was only}} <b>lightly</b> damaged, the American {{aircraft}} sank a destroyer, a submarine and two escort vessels and damaged five small vessels. The Allied pilots also claimed {{the destruction of}} several locomotives and 43 Japanese aircraft as well as damage to another 77 aircraft. Japanese anti-aircraft guns shot down twelve American and two British aircraft.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave spawned Tropical Storm Dean on August 22 {{over the}} Lesser Antilles. Strong wind shear quickly weakened Dean to {{cause it to}} dissipate on August 23. The remnants turned northward, and redeveloped on August 26 {{to the north of}} Bermuda. Located over warm waters and in an area of favorable conditions, Dean steadily strengthened while moving to the northeast, and peaked just below hurricane status on August 27 southwest of Newfoundland. The storm subsequently weakened over cooler waters, and became extratropical on August 28. Tropical Storm Dean <b>lightly</b> affected Newfoundland, though no damages were reported.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, {{there were}} a total of 69,500 <b>lightly</b> armed troops – 35,000 helots and 34,500 troops {{from the rest of}} Greece; roughly one per hoplite. The number of 34,500 has been {{suggested}} to represent one light skirmisher supporting each non-Spartan hoplite (33,700), together with 800 Athenian archers, whose presence in the battle Herodotus later notes. Herodotus tells us that {{there were a}}lso 1,800 Thespians (but does not say how they were equipped), giving a total strength of 108,200 men.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the chronicle}} of Theophanes the Confessor, the invading Umayyad force totalled 90,000 men. 10,000 <b>lightly</b> armed men under al-Ghamr ibn Yazid {{were sent to}} raid the western coastlands, {{followed}} by 20,000 under Abdallah al-Battal and al-Malik ibn Su'aib who marched towards Akroinon, while the main force of some 60,000 (this last number is certainly much inflated), under Sulayman ibn Hisham, raided Cappadocia.|$|E
5|$|After track {{alterations}} {{were done}} on 23 February 2010, the two fastest four-man practice times were done by Germany's Lange and the United States' Steven Holcomb. Australia withdrew its four-man team on 23 February 2010 after {{two of its}} crew members suffered concussions from crashes sustained during track practice. Australia's chef de mission Ian Chesterman stated that the decision was not taken <b>lightly</b> and was done {{on the side of}} safety.|$|E
5|$|Already <b>lightly</b> {{regarded}} {{because he}} was selected by the Democratic Central Committee instead of a party primary, Fields further weakened his position due {{to some of his}} personal preferences. A devout Methodist and prohibitionist, Fields prohibited both dancing and drinking at the Executive Mansion. He moved the inaugural ball from the mansion to the capitol rotunda, where dancing would be allowed, but he and his wife did not attend. Fields' frugality also led him to keep dairy cows on the mansion's lawn, drawing derision from urban citizens.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew it <b>lightly</b> {{first to}} subdue it. They {{typically}} have small hinged pedicellate teeth, a feature unique to amphibians. The base and crown {{of these are}} composed of dentine separated by an uncalcified layer and they are replaced at intervals. Salamanders, caecilians and some frogs {{have one or two}} rows of teeth in both jaws, but some frogs (Rana spp.) lack teeth in the lower jaw, and toads (Bufo spp.) have no teeth. In many amphibians there are also vomerine teeth attached to a facial bone in the roof of the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Battleship Division 1 rendezvoused with Ozawa's main {{force on}} 16 June near the Mariana Islands, and Nagato escorted three {{aircraft}} carriers during the Battle of the Philippine Sea. She was only <b>lightly</b> engaged during the battle, was not damaged, and suffered no casualties. After the battle, the ship returned to Japan {{where she was}} refitted with additional radars and light AA guns. Nagato loaded a regiment of the 28th Infantry Division and delivered them at Okinawa on 11 July before continuing on to Lingga.|$|E
