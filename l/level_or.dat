30|$|Associated {{with the}} 2004 {{earthquake}} off {{the west coast}} of northern Sumatra, changes in groundwater <b>levels</b> <b>or</b> pressures were observed at many observation stations in Japan which are more than 5000 km from the hypocenter. At 38 of the 45 observation stations, there were changes in groundwater <b>levels</b> <b>or</b> pressures. At the 10 observation stations in which the Ishii-type borehole strain instruments were established, changes in crustal strains were also observed. A major part of the changes in crustal strains and groundwater <b>levels</b> <b>or</b> pressures were dynamic oscillations due to a seismic wave. At some stations, coseismic or postseismic rises or drops were also observed. At five stations where both crustal stain and groundwater <b>levels</b> <b>or</b> pressures were observed, postseismic changes in groundwater <b>levels</b> <b>or</b> pressures were consistent with coseismic static steps in crustal strains. At the other five stations, postseismic changes in groundwater <b>levels</b> <b>or</b> pressures did not agree with the coseismic static steps. At two stations of these five stations, it is anticipated that the pore water pressure change in each aquifer locally occurred independently of the change in crustal strain. At another station, postseismic changes in groundwater level possessed the same characteristics as a model removing the temporary deposition. At the last two stations, the causes of the changes are unknown.|$|R

5|$|As {{biologists}} define macroevolution, both microevolution and macroevolution {{have been}} observed. Speciations, for example, have been directly observed many times, despite popular misconceptions to the contrary. Additionally, the modern evolutionary synthesis draws no distinction in the processes {{described by the}} theory of evolution when considering macroevolution and microevolution as the former is simply at the species <b>level</b> <b>or</b> above and the latter is below the species level. An example of this is ring species.|$|E

Migrants are more gregarious, travelling in small flocks and feeding in loose groups in the wintering grounds.

5|$|Bohr {{developed}} the Bohr {{model of the}} atom, in which he proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the atomic nucleus but can jump from one energy <b>level</b> (<b>or</b> orbit) to another. Although the Bohr model has been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid. He conceived the principle of complementarity: that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties, like behaving as a wave or a stream of particles. The notion of complementarity dominated Bohr's thinking in both science and philosophy.|$|E
5|$|East Antarctica {{is a cold}} {{region with}} a ground base above sea level and {{occupies}} most of the continent.

However, increased ice outflow has been suggested in some regions.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, Cassini {{found the}} first {{evidence}} of fluid-filled channels on Titan, {{in a series of}} deep, steep-sided canyons flowing into Ligeia Mare. This network of canyons, dubbed Vid Flumina, range in depth from 240 to 570m and have sides as steep as 40°. They are believed to have formed either by crustal uplifting, like Earth's Grand Canyon, or a lowering of sea <b>level,</b> <b>or</b> perhaps a combination of the two. The depth of erosion suggests that liquid flows in this part of Titan are long-term features that persist for thousands of years.|$|E
