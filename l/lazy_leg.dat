60|$|But if we Southern whale-fishers {{are not so}} snugly housed aloft as Captain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; {{yet that}} {{disadvantage}} is greatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a chat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there; then ascending a little way further, and throwing a <b>lazy</b> <b>leg</b> over the top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so at last mount to my ultimate destination.|$|E
6000|$|Once more Blakeney turned, {{and from}} his high {{altitude}} looked down on the choleric little man before him; but not even for a second did he seem to lose his own imperturbable good-humour. He laughed his own pleasant and inane laugh, and burying his slender, long hands into the capacious pockets of his overcoat, he said leisurely--"a bloodthirsty young ruffian, Do {{you want to make}} a hole in a law-abiding man? [...] . As for me, sir, I never fight duels," [...] he added, as he placidly sat down and stretched his long, <b>lazy</b> <b>legs</b> out before him. [...] "Demmed uncomfortable things, duels, ain't they, Tony?" ...|$|R

6000|$|I found Mr. Fairlie greatly {{relieved}} at {{the prospect}} of the [...] "family worry" [...] (as he was pleased to describe his niece's marriage) being settled at last. So far, I did not feel called on to say anything to him about my own opinion, but when he proceeded, in his most aggravatingly languid manner, to suggest that the time for the marriage had better be settled next, in accordance with Sir Percival's wishes, I enjoyed the satisfaction of assailing Mr. Fairlie's nerves with as strong a protest against hurrying Laura's decision as I could put into words. Sir Percival immediately assured me that he felt the force of my objection, and begged me to believe that the proposal had not been made in consequence of any interference on his part. Mr. Fairlie leaned back in his chair, closed his eyes, said we both of us did honour to human nature, and then repeated his suggestion as coolly as if neither Sir Percival nor I had said a word in opposition to it. It ended in my flatly declining to mention the subject to Laura, unless she first approached it of her own accord. I left the room at once after making that declaration. Sir Percival looked seriously embarrassed and distressed, Mr. Fairlie stretched out his <b>lazy</b> <b>legs</b> on his velvet footstool, and said, [...] "Dear Marian! how I envy you your robust nervous system! Don't bang the door!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't have it, George!" [...] {{cried the}} admiral, angrily {{drumming}} {{on the table}} with the nutcrackers. [...] "You are trying to draw me like a badger, but I won't be drawn! I'll make any conditions I please; and I'll be accountable to nobody for them unless I like. It's quite bad enough to have worries and responsibilities laid on my unlucky shoulders that I never bargained for--never mind what worries: they're not yours, they're mine--without being questioned and cross-questioned as if I was a witness in a box. Here's a pretty fellow!" [...] continued the admiral, apostrophizing his nephew in red-hot irritation, and addressing himself to the dogs on the hearth-rug {{for want of a better}} audience. [...] "Here's a pretty fellow? He is asked to help himself to two uncommonly comfortable things in their way--a fortune and a wife; he is allowed six months to get the wife in (we should have got her, in the Navy, bag and baggage, in six days); he has a round dozen of nice girls, to my certain knowledge, in one part of the country and another, all at his disposal to choose from, and what does he do? He sits month after month, with his <b>lazy</b> <b>legs</b> crossed before him; he leaves the girls to pine on the stem, and he bothers his uncle to know the reason why! I pity the poor unfortunate women. Men were made of flesh and blood, and plenty of it, too, in my time. They're made of machinery now." ...|$|R
