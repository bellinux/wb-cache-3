25|$|According to his autobiography, Oh My, Dick Enberg (then {{the lead}} play-by-play voice for The NFL on NBC) was {{informed}} by NBC {{that he would}} become the lead play-by-play voice of the Major League Baseball Game of the Week beginning with the 1982 World Series (sharing the play-by-play duties for that game with Joe Garagiola, alongside analyst Tony Kubek) and through subsequent regular seasons. Enberg wrote that on his football trips, he would read every edition of The Sporting News {{to make sure he}} was current with all the baseball news and notes. He then met with NBC executives in September 1982, who informed him that Vin Scully was in negotiations to be their lead baseball play-by-play announcer (teaming with Garagiola, while Kubek would team with Bob Costas) and would begin with the network in the spring of 1983. Therefore, rather than throw him in randomly for one World Series, Enberg wrote that he hosted the pre-game/post-game shows while the team of Joe Garagiola and Tony Kubek did the games. According to the book, Enberg was not pleased about the decision (since he <b>loved</b> <b>being</b> the California Angels' radio voice in the 1970s and was eager to return to baseball) but the fact that NBC was bringing in Scully, arguably baseball's best announcer, was understandable. Enberg added that NBC also gave him a significant pay increase as a pseudo-apology for not coming through on the promise to make him the lead baseball play-by-play announcer.|$|E

After two weeks Lennon asked {{to sleep in a}} separate room, saying he could only meditate when he was alone, but walked down to the local post office every morning to see if he had received a telegram from Ono, who sent one almost daily. Cynthia found out about these secretive trips much later, saying: [...] "I had thought our magical interlude with the Maharishi would be the making of our marriage – but in reality it just presaged the end". Paul Saltzman later published a book of photographs, The Beatles in Rishikesh, showing Lennon deep in thought, and Cynthia's confused expression. Despite the alienation from Lennon, she later spoke about her time there, saying: [...] "I <b>loved</b> <b>being</b> away from the fans, hordes of people, deadlines, demands and flashing cameras".|$|E

500|$|At one point, {{the project}} was nearly {{abandoned}} because Peirce was not satisfied {{with most of the}} people who auditioned. In 1996, after a hundred female actors had been considered and rejected, the relatively unknown actor Hilary Swank sent a videotape to Peirce and was signed on to the project. Swank successfully passed as a boy to the doorman at her audition. During her audition, Swank, who was 22, lied to Peirce about her age. Swank said that like Brandon she was 21 years of age. When Peirce later confronted her about her lie, Swank responded, [...] "But that's what Brandon would do". Swank's anonymity as an actor persuaded Peirce to cast her; Peirce said she did not want a [...] "known actor" [...] to portray Teena. In addition, Peirce felt that Swank's audition was [...] "the first time I saw someone who not only blurred the gender lines, but who was this beautiful, androgynous person with this cowboy hat and a sock in her pants, who smiled and <b>loved</b> <b>being</b> Brandon." ...|$|E
500|$|Lopez's vocals for [...] "Dance Again" [...] were {{arranged}} by RedOne and produced by Kuk Harrell. They were recorded at Pinky's Palace.

In an interview with Ryan Seacrest, Lopez revealed that she <b>loved</b> <b>being</b> able to collaborate with RedOne and Pitbull again. She stated: [...] "We had a great chemistry the last time, and it was like 'We're {{going to have to do}} something again.' And this was the perfect song. I love the message of the song. That when something bad happens, your life is not over. You have to get up. You're gonna live. You're gonna to be okay. You're gonna dance again." ...|$|E
500|$|McAdams reprised {{her role}} as Irene Adler in the mystery/action-adventure sequel , but the female lead role was played by Noomi Rapace. Joel Silver, the film's producer, has said that [...] "we always {{intended}} {{to have a different}} kind of girl for each movie" [...] in the vein of Bond girls. He found it [...] "complicated" [...] to persuade McAdams to return in a smaller role: [...] "She <b>loved</b> <b>being</b> with us, but she hoped to have a bigger role." [...] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal felt [...] "she vanishes all too soon in this overproduced, self-enchanted sequel, and so does the spirit of bright invention that made the previous film such a pleasant surprise." [...] Scott Mendelson of The Huffington Post remarked that she [...] "exhibits far more personality and roguish charm in her few moments here than she did in all of the previous film. Freed from the constraints of being the de-facto love interest, McAdams relishes the chance to go full-villain." [...] The film has grossed over $543million worldwide.|$|E

500|$|MCA at {{the time}} was riding out a dead spell, and was derisively {{referred}} to in the music industry as MCA — Musicians' Cemetery of America. Despite this, MCA's persistence and sincerity won the band over, as well as their promise of complete artistic freedom. The trio signed a joint venture deal with MCA to distribute their sophomore album with Cargo. Drummer Scott Raynor was happy for the band's signing, but was uneasy with signing to a major label — he much preferred Epitaph, and when the band passed over the label, he began to feel only half-invested in the band. Raynor was not, however, difficult about the band's mainstream growth: [...] "I didn't measure success in terms of oppositional credibility. I <b>loved</b> <b>being</b> on the radio and MTV. We were certified products of pop culture, born and bred in suburbia." [...] Thanks to the band's established fan base and merchandising, MCA did not intervene much in the band's activities. Although the label had granted the band artistic freedom in their contract, MCA did step in and warn the band when they planned to feature a spoof of the [...] "Macarena" [...] on Dude Ranch, humorously titled [...] "Hey Wipe Your Anus".|$|E
500|$|Clyde Phillips {{claimed the}} Dexter staff {{did not know}} how the finale would {{conclude}} until late in the season, but he said Rita's death began to feel inevitable as the story evolved. Benz said she had been told that Lithgow knew about it {{from the beginning of the}} season. Phillips said the staff felt obligated to do more than kill the Trinity Killer in the final episode, especially because he felt the death of the third season antagonist (played by Jimmy Smits) was not handled [...] "as well as we could have". The writers discussed the idea of having Debra find out about Dexter's secret life, but decided they could not anticipate how drastically the series would be changed by that. Benz heard rumors from David Zayas that her character would be killed in the episode, but she was not notified until much later. [...] The producers met with her the day before the season finale script was distributed to the cast. She said, [...] "It was a tough meeting. In a bizarre way, it felt like a scene from Defending Your Life." [...] Benz described the death scene as [...] "very poetic". Clyde Philips said, [...] "She wasn’t happy. She <b>loved</b> <b>being</b> with us. We loved having her with us. She took it... professionally. She was greatly disappointed. She’s a professional. She works in television. She knew that this was a possibility." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Ramsley Isler of IGN called [...] "Dead Celebrities" [...] one of {{the best}} episodes of the season, adding the jokes {{at the expense of the}} deceased were not too tasteless. He praised the parodies of The Sixth Sense, Poltergeist and Ghost Hunters, but said some jokes, like the masturbating judges at the children's beauty contest, were offensive and unfunny. Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson, stars of Ghost Hunters, declared that [...] "far from being offended or incensed [...] they <b>loved</b> <b>being</b> made fun of alongside Michael Jackson and Billy Mays. Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine said [...] "Dead Celebrities" [...] was an especially funny episode that also featured a [...] "crapload of story" [...] that was well-timed for the Halloween season. Josh Modell of The A.V. Club called it [...] "a decent episode", but felt the dead celebrities were too obvious targets for South Park satire, adding, [...] "It's easy to make the same jokes that the rest of the world already has." [...] Modell said the Sixth Sense and Poltergeist references [...] "fell a little flat", but he praised the Chipotle subplot, which he called [...] "beautifully random [...] totally ridiculous". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said the episode was in bad taste, but added, [...] "I laughed until I choked". Tucker described the Michael Jackson impersonation as [...] "first-rate" [...] and felt the solution to freeing Jackson's spirit served as [...] "a ruthless parody of child beauty pageants".|$|E

Little Mix told Capital London on 18 October 2012 that they loved getting to play dark characters in the video. Speaking to the radio station, Jesy Nelson mentioned how fun and exciting the filming of the music video was. Nelson pointed out that the reasoning behind their excitement was because of how the video for [...] "DNA" [...] was completely different from the video for their previous single [...] "Wings". During the interview, Leigh-Anne Pinnock explained that each member of the group plays a character in the music video, and admitted she enjoyed getting to act more in the video. Pinnock said, [...] "I <b>loved</b> <b>being</b> able to play [...] this obsessed weird person that's just crazy over this guy." [...] When filming the music video, Little Mix made use of the song's themes of love and obsession, depicting it to greater extremes.|$|E
