50|$|<b>Liberation</b> <b>cutting</b> {{has similar}} goals to cleaning, namely the {{allocation}} of resources to the most promising trees available on a site. What separates <b>liberation</b> <b>cutting</b> from cleaning is that the overtopping competitors are of a distinctly older age class. Need for <b>liberation</b> <b>cutting</b> often occurs when seedlings of a desired species have been regenerated by a logging operation, but that operation has left older, poor quality or undesired trees that are shading the regeneration and limiting its growth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Liberation</b> <b>cutting</b> may be superficially {{similar to}} an {{overstory}} removal cutting. The {{major difference between}} these {{is that in the}} overstory removal, regeneration was deliberate and the best trees were saved for the final harvest. In the <b>liberation</b> <b>cutting,</b> the worst trees remain and regeneration was likely an afterthought to a logging operation.|$|E

40|$|Selective logging is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} land-use change in the tropics. Despite the resulting degradation of forest structure, selectively logged forests still harbour {{a substantial amount of}} biodiversity leading to suggestions that their protection is the next best alternative to conserving primary, old-growth forests. Restoring carbon stocks under Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) schemes is a potential method for obtaining funding to protect logged forests, via enrichment planting and <b>liberation</b> <b>cutting</b> of vines. This study investigates the impacts of restoring logged forests in Borneo on avian phylogenetic diversity-the total evolutionary history shared across all species within a community-and on functional diversity, with important implications for the protection of evolutionarily unique species and the provision of many ecosystem services. Overall and understorey avifaunal communities were studied using point count and mist-netting surveys, respectively. Restoration caused a significant loss in phylogenetic diversity and MPD (mean pairwise distance) leaving an overall bird community of less total evolutionary history and more closely related species compared to unlogged forests, while the understorey bird community had MNTD (mean nearest taxon distance) that returned towards the lower levels found in a primary forest, indicating more closely related species pairs. The overall bird community experienced a significant loss of functional strategies and species with more specialized traits in restored forests compared to that of unlogged forests, which led to functional clustering in the community. Restoration also led to a reduction in functional richness and thus niches occupied in the understorey bird community compared to unlogged forests. While there are additional benefits of restoration for forest regeneration, carbon sequestration, future timber harvests, and potentially reduced threat of forest conversion, this must be weighed against the apparent loss of phylogenetic and functional diversity from unlogged forest levels, making the biodiversity-friendliness of carbon sequestration schemes questionable under future REDD+ agreements. To reduce perverse biodiversity outcomes, it is important to focus restoration only on the most degraded areas or at reduced intensity where breaks between regimes are incorporated.
