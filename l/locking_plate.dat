50|$|Around 1979, the locking tremolo {{was invented}} by Floyd D. Rose. The locking trem became highly popular among 1980s heavy metal guitarists due to its {{extremely}} wide range of variation and tuning stability. The original Floyd Rose system {{was similar to the}} Fender synchronized tremolo, but with a number of extra mechanisms. The first to be added and most obvious is a <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> on the head nut, tightened with a hex key to fix the strings at this point after tuning. This provides extra tuning stability, particularly during use of the vibrato arm, but as an unwanted side effect it also prevents further adjustment of the pitch using the machine heads.|$|E
30|$|<b>Locking</b> <b>plates</b> are {{fundamentally}} different from conventional plates [2, 3, 5]. The biomechanical properties of <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> are, more appropriately, likened to external fixators than traditional plates and screws [5, 17]. <b>Locking</b> <b>plates</b> rely on fixed angle screws to provide stability rather than the friction between the plate and bone generated by screw torque [17]. This intrinsic dissimilarity makes conventional <b>plates</b> and <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> suited for use in different clinical scenarios [3, 18]. Conventional plates are ideal for achieving union through primary bone healing, with precise reduction, interfragmentary compression and rigid fixation [5, 17, 18]. <b>Locking</b> <b>plates</b> {{on the other hand}} are better suited for providing elastic fixation that result in secondary fracture healing with callus formation [3, 5, 17, 18].|$|R

This review was conducted to compile evidence that <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> and screws improve fixation of fragility fractures. A search of PubMed was performed to identify biomechanical studies as well as clinical series of fragility fractures treated with <b>locking</b> <b>plates.</b> Biomechanics papers had to use models of osteoporotic bone and had to directly compare <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> with traditional plates. Clinical studies included case series in which <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> were applied to elderly patients with fractures of the proximal humerus and periprosthetic distal femur fractures. Most studies are retrospective case series. <b>Locking</b> <b>plates</b> lead to greater stability and higher loads to failure than traditional plates. When applied to proximal humerus fractures, uncomplicated healing occurs in 85 % of patients. Constant and Dash scores approach normal values. For distal femoral periprosthetic fractures, union rates of 75 % are reported with a malunion rate of 10 %.

40|$|Background: <b>Locked</b> bridge <b>plating</b> {{relies on}} {{secondary}} bone healing, which requires interfragmentary motion for callus formation. This study evaluated healing of fractures stabilized with a <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> construct and a far cortical locking construct, {{which is a}} modified <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> approach that promotes interfragmentary motion. The study tested whether far cortical locking constructs can improve fracture-healing compared with standard <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> constructs. Methods: In an established ovine tibial osteotomy model with a 3 -mm gap size, twelve osteotomies were randomly stabilized with <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> or far cortical locking constructs applied medially. The far cortical locking constructs were designed to provide 84 % lower stiffness than the <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> constructs and permitted nearly parallel gap motion. Fracture-healing was monitored on weekly radiographs. After the animals were killed at week 9, healed tibiae were analyzed by computed tomography, mechanical testing in torsion, and histological examination. Results: Callus on weekly radiographs was greater in the far cortical locking constructs than in the <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> constructs. At week 9, the far cortical locking group had a 36 % greater callus volume (p = 0. 03) and a 44 % higher bone mineral content (p = 0. 013) than the <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> group. Callus in the <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> specimens was asymmetric, having 49 % less bonemineral content in the medial callus than in the lateral callus (p = 0. 003). In far cortical locking specimens, medial and lateral callus had similar bone mineral content (p = 0. 91).

5000|$|In {{the rare}} event that an {{unbalanced}} lineset gains so much momentum that the operator cannot stop it, a specified safety procedure is usually followed.

Furthermore, this might position the operator in the path of the batten, arbor, or sandbag as they accelerate downward.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Axial {{dynamization}} of fractures {{can promote}} healing, and overly stiff fixation can suppress healing. A novel technology, termed active plating, provides controlled axial dynamization by the elastic suspension of locking holes within the plate. This prospective, controlled animal study evaluated {{the effect of}} active plates on fracture-healing in an established ovine osteotomy model. We hypothesized that symmetric axial dynamization with active plates stimulates circumferential callus and delivers faster and stronger healing relative to standard locking plates. METHODS: Twelve sheep {{were randomly assigned to}} receive a standard <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> or an active <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> for stabilization of a 3 -mm tibial osteotomy gap. The only difference between plates was that locking holes of active plates were elastically suspended, allowing up to 1. 5 mm of axial motion at the fracture. Fracture-healing was analyzed weekly on radiographs. After sacrifice at nine weeks postoperatively, callus volume and distribution were assessed by computed tomography. Finally, to determine their strength, healed tibiae and contralateral tibiae were tested in torsion until failure. RESULTS: At each follow-up, the active <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> group had more callus (p < 0. 001) than the standard <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> group.

30|$|The final aspect {{that should}} be taken into {{consideration}} is the biomechanical behavior of different types of plates. Several studies have confirmed the biomechanical superiority of <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> over conventional plates [8, 26].

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether one can achieve stable fixation of a two column (transverse) acetabular fracture by only fixing a single column with a <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> and unicortical locking screws. We hypothesized that a <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> applied to the anterior column of a transverse acetabular fracture would create a construct that is more rigid than a non-locking plate, and that this construct would be biomechanically comparable to two column fixation. Methods Using urethane foam models of the pelvis, we simulated transverse acetabular fractures and stabilized them with 1) an anterior column plate with bicortical screws, 2) an anterior <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> with unicortical screws, 3) an anterior plate and posterior column lag screw, and 4) a posterior plate with an anterior column lag screw. These constructs were mechanically loaded on a servohydraulic material testing machine. Construct stiffness and fracture displacement were measured. Result and Discussion We found that two column fixation is 54 % stiffer than a single column fixation with a conventional plate with bicortical screws. There was no significant difference between fixation with an anterior column <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> with unicortical screws and an anterior plate with posterior column lag screw. We detected a non-significant trend towards more stiffness for the anterior <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> compared to the anterior non-locking plate. Conclusion In conclusion, a <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> construct of the anterior column provides less stability than a traditional both column construct with posterior plate and anterior column lag screw. However, the locking construct offers greater strength than a non-locking, bicortical construct, which in addition often requires extensive contouring and its application is oftentimes accompanied by the risk of neurovascular damage. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Locking</b> <b>plates</b> {{transmit}} load through fixed-angle locking screws instead {{of relying on}} plate-to-bone compression. Therefore, locking screws may induce higher stress at the screw-bone interface than that seen with con-ventional nonlocked plating. This study investigated whether <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> in osteoporotic diaphyseal bone causes a greater periprosthetic fracture risk than conventional plating because of stress concentrations at the plate end. It further investigated the effect of replacing the locked end screwwith a conventional screw {{on the strength of}} the fixation construct. Methods: Three different bridge-plate constructs were applied to a validated surrogate of the osteoporotic femoral diaphysis. Constructs were tested dynamically to failure in bending, torsion, and axial loading to determine failure loads and failuremodes. A <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> construct was compared with a nonlocked conventional plating construct. Subsequently, the outermost locking screw in <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> constructs was replaced with a conventional screw to reduce stress concentrations at the plate end. Results: Compared with the conventional <b>plating</b> construct, the <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> construct was 22 % weaker in bending (p = 0. 013), comparably strong in torsion (p = 0. 05), and 15 % stronger in axial compression (p = 0. 017). Substituting the locked end screw with a conventional screw increased the construct strength by 40 % in bending (p = 0. 001) but had no significant effect on construct strength under torsion (p = 0. 22) and compressive loading (p = 0. 53) compared with the <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> construct.

30|$|A {{traditional}} {{argument in}} favor of ORIF with a volar <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> is early mobilization, which theoretically results in less muscle weakness and therefore improved regain of wrist function.

This theory is in accordance with the results of the current meta-analysis that revealed a significant and clinically relevant improved patient-reported functional outcome for volar <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> at 3  months. This difference remained significant under a sensitivity analysis and can therefore be considered to be robust. A more rapid recovery might benefit high demanding patients or athletes, and therefore, treatment with volar <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> for these types of patients with an unstable distal radius fracture is recommended.|$|E

Seventy-seven fractures formed the report of this study. These cases were followed up until complete fracture healing or for a mean time of 77  weeks. At the time of last follow-up, 58 of 77 fractures (75.3  %) progressed to union without complication and radiographic healing occurred at a mean time of 16.3  weeks. Complications occurred in ten fractures that did not affect the healing and in nine fractures that showed delayed or non-union.

30|$|The {{introduction}} {{of the concept of}} minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) around the turn of this century was founded on the emerging body of evidence that both the bone blood supply and the fracture haematoma should be preserved to optimize the fracture healing process, especially in cases of extra-articular diaphyseal fractures (Tong and Bavonratanavech 2007; Wagner and Frigg 2006). This approach to management of closed diaphyseal fracture in clinical practice has been greatly facilitated by the widespread {{introduction of}} <b>locking</b> bridging <b>plates,</b> as well as new locked nailing technology that respects periosteal blood perfusion. Relative fracture stability can be achieved with a bridging <b>locked</b> <b>plate</b> fixation, leading to secondary bone union with callus formation. One advantage of <b>locked</b> <b>plates</b> is that they {{do not need to be}} accurately contoured to the surface of the underlying bone because the construct stability is largely due the angular stability of the locked screws, and it does not rely on friction between the undersurface of the plate and the bone as is the case with conventional bone plates such as the limited contact dynamic compression plates (Babst et al. 2012). Consequently it has been proposed that <b>locked</b> <b>plates</b> produce less disruption of periosteal blood flow in the underlying cortical bone, although this has not been definitely demonstrated experimentally. However, the effects of <b>locked</b> <b>plates</b> and conventional bone plates on the fracture haematoma per se are likely to be similar, and depend more upon the surgical techniques used for fracture reduction and implant placement (Tong and Bavonratanavech 2007). Both <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> and the limited contact dynamic compression plates can be applied with compression plates function (absolute stability) or bridging plate function (relative stability), depending on the degree of fracture comminution.|$|R
