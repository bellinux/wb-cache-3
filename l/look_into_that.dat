500|$|Shortly {{after it}} was {{announced}} that all four Allentown School District middle schools failed to meet PSSA standards in 2009-10, Zahorchak proposed a major overhaul that would effectively eliminate all the district's middle schools and change elementary schools to a kindergarten through eighth grade model. On August 26, 2010, the school board approved a study of the district's facilities which would <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> proposal, or an alternative of building a fifth middle school in East Allentown to reduce the district's middle school student population per building. The Morning Call said if approved, Zahorchak's proposal would be [...] "the biggest overhaul of the city's educational landscape in 30 years".|$|E
2500|$|On the November 30, 2005, Hardball, Senator John Warner (R-Virginia) told Chris Matthews [...] "I {{saw that}} for the first time today. And as {{chairman}} of the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services, we'll <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> because I'm concerned that our credibility abroad is very important. And if we're manufacturing things or taking our wonderful troops and trying to translate their ideas into something that's more our idea, rather than the trooper's idea, then I think we should be looking at it." ...|$|E

60|$|CONFUCIUS. You <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> woman's face; and you believed.|$|R
60|$|My heart thudded violently in that moment, as I <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> {{pale face}} of sorrow. Then Fra Gervasio {{began to speak}} very gently and softly.|$|R
6000|$|... â€œShe busied {{herself in}} {{attending}} to the boy; and nobody <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> room would have seen anything suspicious in those two people exchanging murmurs by the sick-bedside.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. HOPE. Well, if I couldn't sew at your age, Peachey, without {{pricking}} my fingers! Tom, if I have Mr. Lever here, you'll just {{attend to}} what I say and <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> mine! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I were you," [...] she said, without {{daring to}} <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> corner where he sat, [...] "I would break myself of {{the habit of}} perpetually making knots {{in a piece of}} string." ...|$|E
6000|$|She lay {{a little}} longer, and Constance thought her going into her usual state of torpor; but she roused herself to say, 'Would you kindly <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> desk? You {{will find a}} green book.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With {{a pretty}} little stream in the garden, Fred, [...] "said Henrietta, [...] "and <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> {{beautiful}} Sussex coom, {{that there is}} a drawing of in mamma's room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She had a {{very good}} {{education}} when she was young. I <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> myself," [...] said Miss Bordereau. Then she added, [...] "But she has learned nothing since." ...|$|R
6000|$|At that {{he stood}} silent, <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> face, frozen to a dreadful composure, on the {{breaking}} up of which his very life seemed to depend. At last he said: ...|$|R
6000|$|Tom looked up. It was not {{in nature}} to <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> gay, young, {{handsome}} face, without a feeling of pleasure; and Tom felt the tears start in {{his eyes as he}} said, heartily, [...] "God bless you, Mas'r!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh, I {{look after}} the premises. I {{happened}} to be passing just now, and seeing a light in here came in to investigate. Let us have a <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> room,' he added, lifting the sputtering candle from the desk.|$|E
6000|$|As plays were {{constantly}} {{coming in to}} them, Hugh took this one quite {{as a matter of}} routine, with expectation of being bored. He was a little surprised next morning when she asked, [...] "Did you <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> manuscript?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> place before, but it didn't seem worth {{while to}} follow it up," [...] he said. [...] "If you'll wait, I'll go a little farther along it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mr. Tolman. [...] "I have <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>that.</b> Our {{rules are}} very simple, and merely {{say that a}} book may be renewed by the payment of a certain sum." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Look</b> <b>into</b> {{disputes}} <b>that</b> {{may arise}} from the Treaty's implementation ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't like that," [...] he said. [...] "I will <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>that.</b> You {{shall be}} {{provided}} for. Present my card to Judge Chamberlain; I {{am one of}} the trustees, and he will see that you have all the books you want." ...|$|E
60|$|Softly--not all; {{you have}} {{forgotten}} the bog plants; and there are (as I said) many more plants beside on the moor than you fancy. But we will <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> another time. At all events, the plants outside are on the whole {{quite different from the}} hay-field.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's excellent. You're a hero, Beale. I shan't forget you. There's a cheque {{coming to}} me from a {{magazine}} in another week for a short story. When it arrives, I'll <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> matter of back wages. Tell Mrs. Beale I'm much obliged to her, will you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sire and my lord duke," [...] said David, earnestly, [...] "I hope my poor {{words have}} done no injustice. I have <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> lady's eyes. I will stake {{my life that}} she is an angel, letter or no letter." ...|$|R
50|$|One {{study has}} <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> birds <b>that</b> use their cloaca for cooling.|$|R
6000|$|... "They don't," [...] said Smith reassuringly. [...] "I've <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>that.</b> Have no {{pity for}} them. They are amateurs--degraded creatures of {{substance}} {{who take the}} cocktails out of the mouths of deserving professionals. B. Henderson Asher, for instance, is largely interested in gents' haberdashery. And so with the others. We touch their pride, perhaps, but not their purses." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will {{search the}} man, {{to see if}} he carries any despatches," [...] put in Corporal Ruz. [...] "Ha, you rascal, let me get at that breast pocket of yours. And, Camara, climb up into the tree and <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> hole. There may be {{something}} worth finding there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{will not}} do; soap, and ashes, {{and the tears}} of victims, may have washed out the marks of his work from Balthazar himself. The spots we seek are on the soul, man, and we must <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>that,</b> ere thou art {{permitted}} to make one in this goodly company." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place," [...] I {{said to the}} newcomer, [...] "you had better <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> room. You will see that Mr. Delora is not there. I can assure you, from my own knowledge, {{that he has never}} been there. When you have finished, come back {{and tell me what you}} want with him." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Stubbs's {{brother was}} quite as mischievous as a monkey could be; he capered around the room, picking at {{this thing and}} <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> <b>that,</b> until Aunt Olive laughed herself tired, and Uncle Daniel {{declared}} that if the other monkey was anything like this one, Toby was right when he named him Steve Stubbs, so much did he resemble that gentleman in inquisitiveness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, by gum, I do!" [...] he answered. [...] "Ship gone, neck gone--that's {{the size}} of it. Once I <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> bay, Jim Hawkins, and seen no schooner--well, I'm tough, but I gave out. As for that lot and their council, mark me, they're {{outright}} fools and cowards. I'll save your life--if so be as I can--from them. But, see here, Jim--tit for tat--you save Long John from swinging." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will always}} {{stay here with}} us," [...] said Mary to her, caressing her ladyship's rough hand, and <b>looking</b> kindly <b>into</b> <b>that</b> kind face.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{guess the}} return of the jewels squelches the Macdougal theory," [...] he remarked. [...] "He wouldn't be likely to part with the stuff when he'd once got his hands on it. However, I always meant, when we had a moment's spare time, to <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> fellow's whereabouts. We'll take it on {{straight}} away. Can't do any harm." ...|$|E
6000|$|Asad {{turned at}} last to <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> {{handsome}} eager face. For a moment {{he was at a}} loss; then he had recourse to sophistry. [...] "Am I a coward that I should refuse all ways but sure ones?" [...] he demanded in a withering tone. [...] "Or art thou a coward who can counsel none other?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{then went}} on to say that if the commandant wished it, he would have [...] "Two-faces" [...] seized and killed because he had dared to ask for my life. Retief {{answered}} that he would <b>look</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> matter himself, and after Thomas Halstead had confirmed the king's story as to Pereira's conduct, he rose and said good-bye to Dingaan.|$|E
5000|$|Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me {{is owned}} by a company called MK2 in France. And I spoke to them {{a couple of months}} ago. ... I've spoke to them several times about this. ... I think it will happen, but maybe the {{financial}} crisis is ... affecting that in some way. I'm not sure what's going on. I'm pretty sure there's seventeen scenes in that at least but it's been a while since we've <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
60|$|Tavernake <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> faint {{glimmer of}} miserable fire. He was {{conscious}} of a curious feeling in his throat. How little he knew of life! The pathos {{of what she had}} told him, the thought of her bravely traveling the country and singing at third-rate music-halls, never taking any credit to herself, simply that her father might still believe himself a man of talent, appealed to him irresistibly. He suddenly held out his hand.|$|R
60|$|Back {{into the}} {{hen-house}} came Farmer Brown's boy {{and began to}} poke around in all the corners. He moved all the boxes and looked in the grain bin. Then he began {{to look in the}} nests. Unc' Billy could hear him coming nearer and nearer. He was looking in the very next nest to the one in which Unc' Billy was. Finally he <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> very nest. Unc' Billy Possum held his breath.|$|R
