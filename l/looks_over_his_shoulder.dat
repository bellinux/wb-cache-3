2500|$|Love Imprisoned {{features}} a nude woman, {{seated on the}} ground, who has bound Cupid between two trees with a garland of flowers. [...] The annoyed deity <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> at his captor, whose back is to the viewer.|$|E
2500|$|The image {{may be a}} relief, or free-standing, {{and side}} details may be present or omitted. [...] The centre-piece is Mithras clothed in Anatolian costume and wearing a Phrygian cap; who is {{kneeling}} on the exhausted [...] bull, holding it by the nostrils [...] with his left hand, and stabbing it with his right. As he does so, he <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> towards the figure of Sol. A dog and a snake reach up towards the blood. A scorpion seizes the bull's genitals. A raven is flying around or {{is sitting on the}} bull. Three ears of wheat are seen coming out from the bull's tail, sometimes from the wound. The bull was often white. The god is sitting on the bull in an unnatural way with his right leg constraining the bull's hoof and the left leg is bent and resting on the bull's back or flank. The two torch-bearers are on either side, dressed like Mithras, Cautes with his torch pointing up and Cautopates with his torch pointing down. Sometimes Cautes and Cautopates carry shepherds' crooks instead of torches.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the end of}} the other's speech, F. B. goes up to the draughtsman, <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> {{makes one}} or two violent efforts as of inward convulsion, and finally explodes in an {{enormous}} guffaw. [...] "It's capital! By Jove, it's capital! Sir Barnes would never dare to face his constituents with that picture of him hung up in Newcome!" ...|$|E

60|$|You see, Peter's tail is, {{nothing but}} a funny little bunch of cotton, which doesn't look like a tail at all. The only time he ever sees it is when he is back to the Smiling Pool and <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> at his {{reflection}} in the water, and then, of course, he really doesn't see his tail itself. So sometimes when Peter sees the fine tails of his neighbors, a little bit of envy creeps into his heart for just a little while. Why, even little Danny Meadow Mouse has a real tail, short as it is. And as for Happy Jack Squirrel and Reddy Fox and Bobby Coon and Jimmy Skunk, everybody knows what beautiful tails they have. Once Peter thought about it so much that Grandfather Frog noticed how sober he was and asked Peter what the trouble was. When Peter told him that {{it seemed to him that}} Old Mother Nature had not been fair in giving him such a foolish little tail when she had given others such beautiful ones, Grandfather Frog just opened his big mouth and laughed until he had to hold his sides.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} a crime against the public interest," [...] {{answered}} his friend; [...] "there can no mischief happen between two such originals, which {{will not be a}} positive benefit to society, and particularly to the Chevalier's establishment, as he calls it. I have been as sick of that captain's buff belt, and red doublet, for this month past, as e'er I was of aught; and now I hope this bold linendraper will cudgel the ass out of that filthy lion's hide. See, Nigel, see the gallant citizen has ta'en his ground about a bowl's-cast forward, {{in the midst of the}} alley--the very model of a hog in armour. Behold how he prances with his manly foot, and brandishes his blade, much as if he were about to measure forth cambric with it. See, they bring on the reluctant soldado, and plant him opposite to his fiery antagonist, twelve paces still dividing them--Lo, the captain draws his tool, but, like a good general, <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> to secure his retreat, in case the worse come on't. Behold the valiant shop-keeper stoops his head, confident, doubtless, in the civic helmet with which his spouse has fortified his skull--Why, this is the rarest of sport. By Heaven, he will run a tilt at him, like a ram." ...|$|E

5000|$|A nervous caricaturist at work, {{sweating}} profusely, <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> {{and partially}} hides what he's doing {{with his left}} arm as he shakily draws {{the portrait of a}} bearded keffiyeh-wearing man, labelled [...] "MOHAMMED".

50|$|The artist holds a {{paint brush}} {{in his right}} hand, on the left past the viewer, presumably to the object he paints A second man <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> at the {{resulting}} picture. This work is for the viewer, however, face down. Bruegel is limited entirely to the presentation of two dissimilar men: the painter drawn in detail with disheveled hair, bushy eyebrows and unkempt beard, and the more vague outline reproduced viewer behind him with pince-nez, unsightly nose and mouth slightly open.|$|E

50|$|In 1980, Jones was {{accepted}} {{to study with}} Cecil Taylor and his ensemble, who were in residence at the Creative Music Studio in Woodstock, NY. At {{the end of the}} workshop, he performed an extended composition of Taylor's along with other students in front of a distinguished audience of jazz stars which included Carla Bley, Jack DeJohnette, Karl Berger as well as Taylor's associates Sunny Murray, Jimmy Lyons, Alan Silva, Jerome Cooper, and Ramsay Ameen. The event was documented in the April 1980 issue of Downbeat Magazine with a photo featuring Mr. Jones performing, while Taylor <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|E
5000|$|On Serenity, as Simon {{reviews the}} data he {{collected}} on River in [...] "Ariel", Shepherd Book <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> musing about a [...] "warrior-poet" [...] named Xiang Yu. Book cites a Xiang Yu quote {{that suggests that}} the way to truly learn about someone is to torture them, and wonders if this was the purpose behind the brain surgery done on River. Simon disagrees, believing there was a specific goal the unknown surgeons were hoping to achieve. Elsewhere, crime lord Adelei Niska is having another betrayer tortured, also alluding to Xiang Yu. His new lieutenant, Victor, interrupts him to announce a nearby Firefly-class ship that might belong to Malcolm Reynolds, the man who abrogated a business arrangement with Niska. Niska orders his man to fetch the culprit.|$|E
50|$|In the end, Matteï is {{released}} as the cops {{do not have}} enough evidence to charge him. Goldman had earlier in the movie revealed to Matteï that one of the 8 shooters had missed him on purpose in the shootout {{at the start of the}} movie. Matteï figures out that this eighth shooter was his friend and lawyer who had been forced by Zacchia into shooting Matteï. He is forgiven by Matteï and the movie ends with Matteï walking with his family on a beach. His voiceover tells the audience that he had left his past life behind him and all he wanted to do was spend whatever possible time he had left with his family. He also says that he will no more have to look over his shoulder as he is at peace with his past. As they walk away, he turns and <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> which tells us that there is no getting away from his past for him, ever.|$|E

5000|$|Rare listed Conker as {{the fifth}} Rare's video game {{character}} who most improved with age. In 2009, Conker was ranked {{at the fourth}} place on GameDaily's [...] "Top 25 Anti-Heroes" [...] list, with they stating [...] "he may not look like an anti-hero, but that's what makes Conker {{stand out from the}} rest." [...] IGN listed the [...] "Ten Best Things About Conker: Live and Reloaded", saying [...] "in the end, the reason we love Conker: Live and Reloaded so much is because of the big man himself", and also cited the [...] "everyone's favorite boozy squirrel" [...] among the [...] "Gaming's Most Notorious Anti-Heroes", adding he is [...] "cool". In his appearance in Conker: Live and Reloaded, he was called by GameSpy as [...] "cuter than ever", and Dave Kosak said it [...] "makes it all the funnier when he pukes or <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> and blurts out a stream of beeped-out expletives." ...|$|E

50|$|Juli Baker meets Bryce Loski {{two weeks}} before the {{beginning}} of second grade; it's something about those blue eyes that attract her. Julianna knows it's love, while Bryce, like any seven-year-old boy, doesn't. Julianna stalks Bryce all through his childhood; staring at his house, asking him to play, following him at school, etc. Every day, Bryce watches Julianna climb the sycamore tree at the bus stop, from which Julianna always watches the town. She constantly asks Bryce to come join her in the tree, as well as yelling out how far away the bus is. Bryce, being unbelievably shy and annoyed by all the attention, asks out Juli's arch enemy, Shelly Stalls, to get rid of his admirer. Bryce <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> for Julianna every time he's with Shelly, which causes Julianna to think he's being forced to date her. This provokes a cat fight between Juli and Shelly over Bryce. The two break up, and Bryce is back to square one. There comes an incident in sixth grade when, much to Bryce's chagrin and irritation, Juli constantly sniffs Bryce's hair in spelling from her assigned position behind him. According to Juli, his hair smells like watermelon and he has blond earlobe fuzz. Bryce is disgruntled from this seat change, because Juli had initially sat next to him where he could see her answers and copy off of them. Now that she's behind him, he's lost that advantage, and his grades slip, especially in spelling. This halts, however, when as Juli sniffs him, she begins to whisper answers in his ear. Bryce, torn between feeling grateful and awkwardly guilty for hating her so much when she's helping him, follows the answers anyway {{until the end of the}} year.|$|E
