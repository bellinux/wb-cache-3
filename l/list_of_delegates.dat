5000|$|Unlike other Republican caucuses, which {{feature a}} straw poll (or presidential {{preference}} election) {{prior to the}} election <b>of</b> <b>delegates</b> to the state convention, no preference election was conducted. All delegates elected at the caucus are [...] "uncommitted" [...] and considered unallocated to any candidate. However, many campaigns will distribute <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>delegates</b> who will vote for their preferred presidential candidate. Delegates can be any Republican who has submitted the necessary paperwork and paid the $100 fee ($50 for alternate delegate). By setting up the caucus in this non-binding way, it allows Louisiana to avoid the delegate penalties that have befallen Michigan, New Hampshire, and South Carolina.|$|R
