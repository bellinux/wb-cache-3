40|$|Typescript. Bibliography: leaves 104 - 119. Microfiche. [ix], 119 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmOne of {{the major}} {{complaints}} about the <b>liner</b> <b>conference</b> system has been that conferences are cartels collectively setting prices to maximize their profits. The complaint centers around the pricing behavior that has caused inefficiency and involved the misallocation of resources. A number of models have been offered to explain the conference pricing behavior. These include neo-classical models based upon the profit-maximization hypothesis and alternative model, Unfortunately, few of these models have been satisfactory. Overall, they fail to satisfactorily consider multi-product shipping services and {{take into account the}} quality of services as well as non-conference competition. Following the current state-of-the-art, this study has developed a fully-specified model considering the price interrelationships between the conference and non-conference sectors. However, simplified assumptions are necessary because the information necessary for the test of this model is not always readily available. Two simplified models are developed in this study. One is the dominant-firm price-leadership model which considers the market residual demand as a constraint and the other one is the price-constrained model which assumes that the non-conference competition puts a ceiling on the conference freight rates. The latter consists of a two-equation system. The "first equation" is for the situation where the conference does not face strong competition and acts as a price-maker while the "second equation" where it does and acts as a price-taker. This model has confirmed that the inelastic demand for the conference transport services can not be an evidence rejecting the profit-maximization hypothesis as long as the quality of services is one of the decision variables of the conference. In the meantime, the conference "value-of- service" pricing practice is also consistent with the competitive market situation. The empirical test of these simplified models using regression analysis based upon the data pertaining to the Latin American exports shows the structure of the conference freight rates is consistent with either the price-leadership model or the price-constrained model. The conference acts as a price-maker or price-leader for the high-value commodities and as a price-taker for the low-value ones...|$|E
40|$|This book {{examines}} {{the application of}} Community principles of freedom to provide services and of free competition in international shipping lines in relation to unilateral and bilateral measures implemented by various countries to defend the interests of their flag shipping companies and in relation to agreements between shipowners (conferences, shipping consortia, strategic alliances) {{in order to reduce}} competition. With regard to the latter aspect is taken into account the question of the compatibility between agreements in liner shipping and EU antitrust rules (article 101 and article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) with particular attention to <b>liner</b> <b>conferences.</b> In 1986 a block exemption from the application of the European antitrust law had been justified on the assumption that <b>liner</b> <b>conferences</b> brought stability, ensuring shippers reliable services that could not be achieved by less restrictive means. The block exemption had been in place for two decades. More recently a study conducted by the European Commission determined that <b>liner</b> <b>conferences</b> operating in EU trades were not producing the anticipated benefits that had justified the original block exemption. So, in 2006 the European Union decided to repeal the block exemption from competition law for <b>liner</b> shipping <b>conferences.</b> After a two years transition period, the repeal went into effect in October 2008. It is therefore examined the impact of the repeal of the conference block exemption on the shipowners, on the shippers and in general on the international liner trades.

30|$|Concurrently {{with the}} {{development}} of <b>Liner</b> Shipping <b>Conferences,</b> Vessel Sharing Agreements (VSAs) allowed ocean carriers to mutually cooperate through space sharing on larger vessels and provide schedule stability while reducing operational costs. Transport that would otherwise require each carrier to support a large fleet for all their sea-lanes on an individual basis could be rationalized to allow smaller lines in particular the ability to serve more destinations. This evolved into slot chartering agreements between two or more operators to ensure better economies of scale than container liner service performed individually (Cullinane and Khanna, 1999). VSAs typically were executed based on geographic coverage, port rotation, sailing frequency, the vessels in service, and participant’s share in vessel spaces. A distinction between VSAs and <b>liner</b> <b>conferences</b> is that in a VSA each operator carries out its own marketing identity; its own bills of lading, carriage and handling including port terminals and land transport (Karmelic, 2010).

40|$|Liner {{shipping}} is {{the business}} of offering common carrier ocean shipping services in international trade. Since it became an important industry in the 1870 s, it has been characterized by various agreements between firms. Historically, since the formation in 1875 of the Calcutta Conference, the conference system was the primary form of agreement in liner shipping. Variously called <b>liner</b> <b>conferences,</b> shipping conferences, and ocean shipping conferences, they are formal agreements between liner shipping lines on a route, always setting (possibly discriminatory) prices, and sometimes pooling profits or revenues, managing capacity, allocating routes, and offering loyalty discounts. Conferences agreements were quite successful {{and in many cases}} have lasted for years. In the last two decades, conferences have begun to be supplanted by alliances (particularly in the American and European trades, where legislative changes have been unfavourable to them), which are less complete (they do not, for example, set prices) but encompass more broadly defined trade routes...|$|R
40|$|Developing {{countries}} pay {{substantially higher}} transportation costs than developed nations, {{which leads to}} less trade and perhaps lower incomes. This paper investigates price discrimination in the shipping industry and the role it plays in determining transportation costs. In the presence of market power, shipping prices depend on the demand characteristics of goods being traded. We show theoretically and estimate empirically that ocean cargo carriers charge higher prices when transporting goods with higher product prices, lower import demand elasticities, and higher tariffs, and when facing fewer competitors on a trade route. These characteristics explain more variation in shipping prices than do conventional proxies such as distance, and significantly contribute to the higher shipping prices facing the developing world. A simple back of the envelope calculation suggests that eliminating market power in shipping would boost trade volumes by 5. 9 % (for the US) to 15. 2 % (for Latin America). Our findings are also important for evaluating the impact of tariff liberalization. Cargo carriers decrease shipping prices by 1 - 2 % for every 1 % reduction in tariffs.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to shed light}} on the proposal that firms in concentrated industries may keep excess capacity to forestall entry or expansion by rivals. Excess capacity can deter entry by forming expectations on the part of potential entrants that dominant firms are capable of responding aggressively to threats. But {{in order to make a}} convincing case for excess capacity as a strategic entry deterrent, all potential sources of excess capacity must be considered simultaneously. These may include industry-specific structural factors, such as the divisibility of demand relative to supply, economies of scale or wide swings in demand. Ocean liner shipping exhibits structural factors that have led excess capacity for much of its history. It is a concentrated industry that until the late 1990 s was dominated by price fixing industry groups known as <b>liner</b> shipping <b>conferences.</b> In spite of limited antitrust immunity granted by most governments to <b>liner</b> shipping <b>conferences,</b> excess capacity is and has been a persistent problem that could be a major cause of operational inefficiencies. As such, ocean liner shipping presents an ideal forum in which to distinguish between excess capacity that is an artefact of structural conditions of supply and demand and excess capacity that may be deployed as a strategic defense against opportunistic rivals. The results of a random effects model with instrumental variables show some limited support for the entry deterrence element of excess capacity in liner shipping.

30|$|Co-operative {{behavior}} has {{deep roots in}} ocean shipping. The concept of common carriage, where carriage must be offered, upon reasonable demand, to any who sought their services, was the impetus for agreements begun {{in the nineteenth century}} by ocean shipping companies to avoid destructive competition leading to company failures and irregularities in shipping schedules (Panayides and Wiedmer, 2011). In the twentieth century, <b>Liner</b> Shipping <b>Conferences,</b> composed of member carriers in different sea lanes, were utilized to stabilize rates, control capacity, and maintain adequate profit levels for the industry. The Conference system was much maligned but provided a measure of rate stability and a framework for carriers to effectively differentiate their service offerings (Clarke, 1997). Conferences did not directly prescribe service standards, though there was incentive pricing covering delay factors and ancillary services. The Conference system largely disappeared in major east-west trade lanes in the twenty-first century due to the advent of confidential service contracts and abolition of anti-trust exemptions.|$|R
40|$|International shipping, as an {{infrastructure}} of international trade, {{is a key}} source of power in world politics, and for developing countries, it allegedly contributes to their underdevelopment. So, in 1964, they embarked on a vigorous attempt to restructure the liberal regime governing world shipping and {{to replace it with}} one that would reflect their developmental aspirations. This attempt culminated in the adoption of the United Nations Convention on a Code of Conduct for <b>Liner</b> <b>Conferences</b> in 1974 which became law in 1983. This quest for a new international maritime order was integral to the larger demand for a new international economic order in the early 1970 s. ^ After almost 28 years, it has become obvious that developing countries have failed to change the liberal shipping regime. Liberal institutionalists attribute this failure to lack of leadership that is willing to bear the cost of creating a new regime. Neo-Marxists see it as another example of the inability of weak countries to develop within the capitalist system. This study departs from these limited views and argues that developing countries failed to change the international shipping regime essentially because they were confronted with the constraints of late industrialization and the structural changes in world politics at the point when they entered the industry. ^ Integrating the late industrialization theory popularized by Alexander Gerschenkron and the structural power theory developed by Susan Strange, this study focuses on those structural and domestic circumstances which have changed, and which have contributed to the failure of this quest for a new international maritime order. West and Central Africa is used as a case study because it was one region that most vigorously sought to enforce the UN Code. Their experiences are then compared with those of four Southeast Asian countries. ^ The study finds that structural changes in world shipping which were not anticipated in 1974, intra-regional maritime competition, and the impact of the organizational technology {{of the state and the}} responses of the relevant segments of the civil society to this style of political management account for the unravelling of the quest for a new order in world shipping. ...|$|R

40|$|The virtual {{disappearance}} of <b>liner</b> shipping <b>conferences</b> from US markets and their elimination in European trades create a significant risk that {{in place of}} these collusive price-setting groups, the industry could become increasingly consolidated. The absence of the conference pricing cushion could end up giving an advantage to large, cost-efficient carriers who will drive smaller players from the market. During this competitive process, shippers could see lower freight rates and better service but as the industry consolidates towards oligopoly, there is the risk that shippers will be faced with fewer alternatives to move their goods, lower service quality and significantly higher prices. The impact on merchandise trade could be substantial. This paper is intended to reveal basic structural characteristics of the liner shipping industry that could point to more accurate predictions of future consolidation activity. In particular, a series of mergers and acquisitions in the industry will be examined {{against the backdrop of}} industry structure and regulatory constraints. Ultimately, a Poisson model is formulated and estimated to extract and quantify the structural factors that increase the likelihood of horizontal merger and acquisition activity.

40|$|Container {{lines have}} been the main {{transport}} mode linking most markets engaged in global trade. To cater for the growing customer demands, container lines have adopted various approaches such as forming strategic co-operations to achieve rapid growth and providing efficient services through the integration of resources. The spectrum of strategic co-operations among container lines varies from loose-knitted slot charters, <b>liner</b> <b>conferences,</b> shipping alliances, joint services and consortia, through to mergers and acquisitions (M&As). However, these forms of strategic co-operations {{have not always been}} able to achieve the intended synergetic growth resulting from the integration of resources. The Resource Based View (RBV) suggests that integrating intangible resources, which are valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable (VRIN), can make a significant contribution to the performance of post strategic co-operations. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the contribution of intangible resources to the post strategic co-operation success of container lines. Therefore, the thesis focuses on the following primary research question (PRQ) : PRQ: Does the integration of intangible resources contribute to the post strategic co-operation success of container lines? To further examine PRQ two subsidiary research questions (SRQ 1 and SRQ 2) are explored. SRQ 1 : Which intangible resources provide the greatest contribution to the market success of container lines? SRQ 2 : Do container lines adopt processes to ensure the successful integration of intangible resources when strategic co-operations are being developed? The design used for this study is a two stage methodology enabling both quantative and qualitative research approaches. The two stage approach helps to identify firstly the senior managers‟ view of the importance of intangible resources and secondly how intangible resources are integrated during strategic co-operations among container lines. The sample consists of 84 senior managers (with a response rate of 51 per cent and thus 47 usable questionnaires) attached to regional offices of leading global container lines and their agents in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. The first stage was conducted via an exploratory mail survey with the objective of investigating senior managers‟ understanding of intangible resources, importantly, the findings of stage one enabled more probing questions to be developed and identified suitable respondents for the second stage of the research. Due to the need for more qualitative responses, stage two was conducted as in-person interviews, with a greater, focus on (i) the extent that intangible resources were being integrated, (ii) the processes adopted to integrate intangible resources, and (iii) the organisation and economic performance of container lines during post-strategic co-operation. The in-depth in-person interviews achieved 100 per cent response rate with participation of 36 senior managers. The findings of stage one, which addressed SRQ 1, revealed that respondents attach a higher importance to intangible resource items such as the reputation of the company, and organisational processes and capabilities. These intangible resources provide major benefits to container lines such as attracting customers and enabling internal functions of container lines including the closely related functions of marketing the services of the container lines. During the stage two in-person interviews, differences were found in how intangible resources were integrated among Limited integrated strategic co-operations (LISCs) (shipping alliances, joint services and consortia) and acquisitions. In LISCs, due to their loosely integrated structure and antitrust laws, sailing schedules have become the only closely integrated intangible resource. Other intangible resources such as organisational processes, capabilities and organisational culture are kept away from the strategic co-operations to gain competitive edge for the individual container lines. The integration of sailing schedules in LISCs has helped the container lines to increase the frequency of services, enter into new trade routes by reducing cost. In acquisitions, apart from sailing schedules intangible resources such as the capabilities and organisational processes of the acquirer container line are adopted by the new entity. The container lines adopted different processes such as organising staff meetings, mixed project teams, joint training sessions, and appointing task teams to integrate these intangible resources in acquisitions. However, colonising of the acquired container line with intangible resources of the acquirer container line and neglecting the important intangible resources of the acquired line has hindered the integration of acquired container line staff to the new entity. Hence, high staff turnover among senior managers was evident in all the acquisitions during the post-acquisition period. This top management turnover, especially in the marketing functions has adversely affected the intended synergetic growth of market share of these acquisitions. Thus, the two stage study helped address both PRQ and SRQ 2 by revealing that intangible resources are important to the market success of container lines, and container lines are advised to identify these intangible resources and adopt processes to integrate them when strategic co-operations are being formed...|$|R
