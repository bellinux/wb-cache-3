40|$|PTHWe {{investigate}} {{properties and}} the distribution of light nuclei (A≤ 4) in symmetric nuclear matter of finite temperature within a microscopic framework. For this purpose we have solved few-body Alt-Grassberger-Sandhas-type equations for quasi-nucleons that include self-energy corrections and Pauli blocking in a systematic way. In a statistical model we find a significant influence in the composition of nuclear matter if medium effects are included in the microscopic calculation of nuclei. If multiplicities are frozen out at a certain time (or volume), we expect significant consequences for the formation of light fragments in a heavy ion collision. As a consequence of the systematic inclusion of medium effects, the ordering of multiplicities becomes opposite to the <b>law-of-mass</b> <b>action</b> of ideal components. This is necessary to explain the large abundance of α-particles in a heavy ion collision that are otherwise largely suppressed in an ideal equilibrium scenari...|$|E
