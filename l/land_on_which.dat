5|$|According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, sound biofuel {{production}} practices would not hamper food and fibre production, nor cause water or environmental problems, and would enhance soil fertility. The selection of <b>land</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> {{to grow the}} feedstocks is {{a critical component of}} the ability of biofuels to deliver sustainable solutions. A key consideration is the minimisation of biofuel competition for prime cropland.|$|E
5|$|Between 1915 and 1919, work {{proceeded}} at Apollo Bundar (Port) {{to reclaim}} the <b>land</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> the gateway and the new sea wall would be built.

5|$|In July 2009 the {{receivers}} {{determined that the}} company was insolvent. With a complex business structure to unravel, some commentators expect it may take years for the company's collapse to be fully resolved. By April 2010, timber company Gunns had taken over as the responsible entity running most of Great Southern's pulpwood schemes, but the <b>land</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> they were being grown was yet to be sold.|$|E
5|$|In her 1953 novel Graham {{suggests}} that Point du Sable left Chicago {{because he was}} angered with the United States government, which wanted him to buy the <b>land</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> he had lived and called his own for the previous two decades. The 1795 Treaty of Greenville and the subsequent westward migration of Indians away from the Chicago area might also have influenced his decision.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-16th century Bourne Place {{was home}} to the Burton family, who {{acquired}} much of the <b>land</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> the present town stands.

5|$|The <b>land</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> the Gateway {{was built}} on was {{previously}} a crude jetty, used by the fishing community which was later renovated and used as a landing place for British governors and other prominent people.

5|$|Being low-lying {{and largely}} {{surrounded}} by water, Norfolk is {{particularly vulnerable to}} rising sea levels. In addition, the <b>land</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> it is built is slowly subsiding. Some areas already flood regularly at high tide, and the city commissioned a study in 2012 to investigate how {{to address the issue}} in the future: it reported the cost of dealing with a sea-level rise of one foot would be around $1,000,000,000. Since then, scientists at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in 2013 have estimated that if current trends hold, the sea in Norfolk will rise by 5 and 1/2 feet or more {{by the end of this}} century.|$|E

5|$|Elcor was {{a mining}} location, {{built by the}} mining company to house the workers for its mines. People were allowed to own their homes, but the <b>land</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> the houses stood belonged to the mining company. After the Corsica mine closed in 1954, Pickands Mather and Company ordered the {{residents}} to vacate the property {{so that it could}} reclaim the land; by 1956, Elcor was completely abandoned. The desolate property changed hands often through acquisitions, mergers and bankruptcies. In 1993 the Inland Steel Company began stripping the overburden from Elcor's former location for what is now the Minorca mine.|$|E

50|$|After some years, {{there was}} an influx of {{migrants}} coming from the provinces of Ilocos, Cagayan and Pangasinan.

During the early 20th century, the <b>land</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> The Oval stood was given in {{perpetuity}} to Glentoran by the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Daniel Dixon.|$|E
5|$|However, a new wrinkle {{appeared}} {{when the}} City of Denver refused {{to transfer the}} parcel of <b>land</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> Pepsi Center stood unless Sturm promised to keep the Avalanche and Nuggets in Denver for at least 25 years. Sturm had made his bid in his own name, and the City wanted to protect itself in case Sturm either died or sold the teams before the 25 years ran out. While Sturm was willing to make a long-term commitment to the city, he wasn't willing to be held responsible if he died or sold the teams. After negotiations fell apart, Liberty bought all of Ascent, but kept the Nuggets and Avalanche on the market.|$|E
5|$|In the 13th century, Newcastle upon Tyne had a {{population}} of around 4,000; and {{it was difficult for}} the four parish churches to care for the needs of such a large population. The priests were expected to be educators, doctors and counsellors, as well as meeting the spiritual needs of their parishioners. Therefore, in 1291 land was donated by William Baron of Wark on Tweed to found an Augustinian friary on the <b>land</b> <b>on</b> <b>which</b> the museum now stands.|$|E
50|$|Kincorth Academy's {{coat of arms}} {{includes}} several symbols, which represent various historical links.
