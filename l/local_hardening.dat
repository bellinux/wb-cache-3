40|$|Abstract. High {{strength}} aluminium {{wrought alloys}} {{as well as}} powder metallurgical aluminium alloys are limited regarding massive formability. The formability at room temperature can be significantly affected by superimposing hydrostatic pressure. Depending on the process control, cold forming enables locally induced strain hardening effects, whereby increased hardness or hardness gradients can be regulated. Simultaneously, the necessity of mechanical post processing is reduced by a metal forming fabrication of joint and connection elements at room temperature. By splitting the component in strengthened and not strengthened regions, specially adapted property profiles can be adjusted to the application. Thus, specially load adapted components with locally optimised property profiles e. g. ductile or high strength, brittle areas can be manufactured. A defined buckling or folding of a component {{in case of a}} crash can thereby be achieved. In this project innovative tool principles for superimposed cold solid forming will be developed.

40|$|In {{this work}} a general {{framework}} for damage and fracture assessment including {{the effect of}} strain gradients is provided. Both mechanism-based and phenomenological strain gradient plasticity (SGP) theories are implemented numerically using finite deformation theory and crack tip fields are investigated. Differences and similarities between the two approaches within continuum SGP modeling are highlighted and discussed. <b>Local</b> strain <b>hardening</b> promoted by geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) {{in the vicinity of}} the crack leads to much higher stresses, relative to classical plasticity predictions. These differences increase significantly when large strains are taken into account, as a consequence of the contribution of strain gradients to the work hardening of the material. The magnitude of stress elevation at the crack tip and the distance ahead of the crack where GNDs significantly alter the stress distributions are quantified. The SGP dominated zone extends over meaningful physical lengths that could embrace the critical distance of several damage mechanisms, being particularly relevant for hydrogen assisted cracking models. A major role of a certain length parameter is observed in the multiple parameter version of the phenomenological SGP theory.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{microstructural}} control is to optimize materials properties. To that end, {{they have developed}} sophisticated and successful computational models of both microstructural evolution and mechanical response. However, coupling these models to quantitatively predict the properties of a given microstructure poses a challenge. This problem arises because most continuum response models, such as finite element, finite volume, or material point methods, do not incorporate a real length scale. Thus, two self-similar polycrystals have identical mechanical properties regardless of grain size, in conflict with theory and observations. In this project, they took a tiered risk approach to incorporate microstructure and its resultant length scales in mechanical response simulations. Techniques considered include low-risk, low-benefit methods, as well as higher-payoff, higher-risk methods.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is the {{modeling}} of the deformation behavior and orientation gradient development in a highly anisotropic thin metal sheet and comparison with experiment. This sheet consists of a single layer of "large" Fe- 3 %Si grains exhibiting a coarse texture. Since such materials are highly heterogeneous, they are modeled by combining single-crystal plasticity for each grain with the finite-element method for the grain morphology and specimen as a whole. The single-crystal model is rate-dependent, accounts for (<b>local)</b> dissipative <b>hardening</b> effects, and has been identified {{with the help of}} single-crystal data. In previous work Klusemann et al. (2012 b), model predictions for the evolution of the specimen geometry and grain morphology during tension loading to large deformation have been shown to agree reasonably well with the corresponding experimental results of Henning and Vehoff (2005). In the current work, model predictions for the development of orientation gradients in the specimen under different modeling assumptions (e. g., active glide-system family) are compared with EBSD-based experimental results of Henning and Vehoff (2005). Model predictions for the development of geometrically necessary dislocations are also discussed. As well, additional measures of local orientation evolution such as reorientation are examined and compared with the orientation gradient picture. In addition, we examine the effect of additional grain boundary strengthening related to grain boundary misorientation and grain size and the effect of additional GND-based kinematic hardening.
