5|$|In June 1910 Pound {{returned}} to the United States for eight months; his arrival coincided {{with the publication of}} his first book of literary criticism, The Spirit of Romance, based on his lecture notes at the polytechnic. His essays on America were written during this period, compiled as Patria Mia and not published until 1950. He loved New York but felt the city was threatened by commercialism and vulgarity, and he no <b>longer</b> <b>felt</b> at home there. He found the New York Public Library, then being built, especially offensive and, according to Paul L. Montgomery, visited the architects' offices almost every day to shout at them.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, Knox {{suffered}} {{a head injury}} during a match in Germany and was diagnosed with possible damage to her eighth cranial nerve. She was scheduled to return to wrestling in 2008, but no-showed the event, stating she no <b>longer</b> <b>felt</b> that wrestling was the right option for her at that time. She later returned to Shimmer as a manager in 2011, before signing a contract with WWE in 2013. Following her arrival on the main roster in July 2015, she became the inaugural SmackDown Women's Champion at Backlash in September 2016.|$|E
5|$|After the New York City draft {{riots in}} 1863, Smith {{and his family}} were among {{prominent}} blacks who left New York and moved to Brooklyn, then still a separate city. He no <b>longer</b> <b>felt</b> safe in his old neighborhood. In the 1870 census, Malvina and her four children were living in Ward 15, Brooklyn. All were listed as white. James W. Smith, who had married a white woman, was living in a separate household and working as a teacher; he was also classified as white. The Smith children still at home were Maud, 15; Donald, 12; John, 10; and Guy, 8; all were attending school. Five Smith children survived to adulthood: James, Maud, Donald, John and Guy. The men married white spouses, but Maud never married. All were classified as white from 1860 on.|$|E
50|$|For {{the case}} when two {{different}} plural endings have historically been added onto a word (but {{one of them is}} no <b>longer</b> synchronically <b>felt</b> to have plural force, or even to be a distinct morpheme), see Double plural.|$|R
60|$|It really {{seemed the}} {{beginning}} of a new life, not to have that dreadful fear hanging over us any <b>longer!</b> We <b>felt</b> settled, that was one thing; not as if we should do as Bertram expected, have to come off to New Zealand.|$|R
60|$|Captain Clavering {{could not}} endure this any <b>longer.</b> He <b>felt</b> that {{the manner of}} the lady was, to say the least of it, unpleasant, and he {{perceived}} that he was doing no good to his own cause. So he rose from his chair and muttered some words with the intention of showing his purpose of departure.|$|R
5|$|In the 1250s, the {{fortunes}} of the Hospitallers at Krak des Chevaliers took a turn for the worse. A Muslim army estimated to number 10,000men ravaged the countryside around the castle in 1252 after which the Order's finances declined sharply. In 1268 Master Hugh Revel complained that the area, previously home to around 10,000people, now stood deserted and that the Order's property in the Kingdom of Jerusalem produced little income. He also noted that by this point there were only 300 of the Order's brethren left in the east. On the Muslim side, in 1260 Baibars became Sultan of Egypt, following his overthrow of the incumbent ruler Qutuz, and went on to unite Egypt and Syria. As a result, Muslim settlements that had previously paid tribute to the Hospitallers at Krak des Chevaliers no <b>longer</b> <b>felt</b> intimidated into doing so.|$|E
5|$|To {{reestablish}} their {{supply lines}} and retake {{the towns of}} Bardaï, Zouar and Wour, the Libyans sent a task-force of 2,000 troops with T-62 tanks and heavy support by the Libyan Air Force into the Tibesti. The offensive started successfully, expelling the GUNT from its key strongholds, also {{through the use of}} napalm. This attack ultimately backfired, causing the prompt reaction of Habré, who sent 2,000 FANT soldiers to link with the GUNT forces. Also Mitterrand reacted forcefully, ordering a mission which parachuted fuel, food, ammunition and anti-tank missiles to the rebels, and also infiltrated military personnel. Through this action, the French made clear that they no <b>longer</b> <b>felt</b> committed to keep south of the Red Line, and were ready to act whenever they found it necessary.|$|E
25|$|By this time, it {{was said}} that Emperor Yang's {{lifestyle}} had become particularly wasteful, and that he no <b>longer</b> <b>felt</b> bound by moral principles.|$|E
60|$|Harz {{had lain}} down, fully dressed. He was no <b>longer</b> angry, but <b>felt</b> {{that he would}} rather die than yield. Presently he heard {{footsteps}} coming up the stairs.|$|R
6000|$|This was an {{unexpected}} declaration to Elizabeth, who, although she experienced no idle apprehension of {{a danger that}} no <b>longer</b> existed, <b>felt</b> most sensitively all the delicacy of maiden modesty. She stood for some time, deeply reflecting within herself; but, sensible {{it was a time}} for action instead of reflection, she struggled to shake off her hesitation, and replied, firmly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bob--Bob White! Bob--Bob White! Bob--Bob White!" [...] {{clear and}} sweet, that call floated {{over to the}} dear Old Briar-patch until Peter could stand it no <b>longer.</b> He <b>felt</b> that {{he just had to}} go over and pay an early morning call on one of his very best friends, who at this season of the year delights in {{whistling}} his own name--Bob White.|$|R
25|$|The {{destruction}} of Saint-Francis by Rogers {{was a major}} psychological victory, as the colonists no <b>longer</b> <b>felt</b> that they were helpless. The residents of Saint-Francis, a combined group of Abenakis and others, understood that {{they were no longer}} beyond reach. Abenaki raids along the frontier did not cease, but significantly diminished.|$|E
25|$|The {{case had}} a strong impact on the neighbourhood, {{the city and the}} entire nation. Teenagers {{reported}} that they no <b>longer</b> <b>felt</b> safe in their communities. Polls showed that over half the country's parents were more afraid for their children than before. In addition, an increased number of women said they felt unsafe being outside after dark.|$|E
25|$|This musical style {{reflects}} {{a confluence of}} influences from traditional music, French urban popular songs of the 1960s, African music and Brazilian popular music. By the late 1970s the revolutionary climate had subsided {{and the need to}} express political militancy through song was no <b>longer</b> <b>felt</b> by poets, composers and singers, who subsequently redefined both their role and their creative contribution.|$|E
60|$|Now {{a strange}} thing happened. The higher the young man climbed the higher the birds seemed to be, and when he looked down the earth below {{appeared}} {{no bigger than a}} star. Sill he tried to go back, but he could not, and though he could not see the birds any <b>longer</b> he <b>felt</b> as if something were dragging him up and up.|$|R
60|$|At last {{he could}} stand his present state no <b>longer,</b> he <b>felt</b> an {{unpleasant}} tingling to the very {{tips of his fingers}} and the very roots of his hair; it seemed to him as if soft noiseless steps wandered aimlessly outside his door; furtive tiny animals with feet of velvet must have run down the stairs and then halted, breathless and terrified, {{on the other side of}} those rattling wooden panels.|$|R
60|$|In the evening, {{when every}} one {{had left the}} {{workshop}} and gone home, a great longing drove Labakan back {{to the place where}} the royal robe hung. He stood a long time gazing at it, admiring the rich material and the splendid embroidery in it. At last he could hold out no <b>longer.</b> He <b>felt</b> he must try it on, and lo! and behold, it fitted {{as though it had been}} made for him.|$|R
25|$|The few Jews in Poland were {{augmented}} by returnees from the Soviet Union and survivors from camps in Germany. However, {{a resurgence of}} antisemitism in Poland, in such incidents as the Kraków pogrom on August 11, 1945, and the Kielce pogrom on July 4, 1946, led to the exodus of {{a large part of}} the Jewish population, which no <b>longer</b> <b>felt</b> safe in Poland. Anti-Jewish riots also broke out in several other Polish cities where many Jews were killed.|$|E
25|$|In January 2002 U.S. President George W. Bush labeled North Korea in {{his first}} State of the Union Address {{as part of an}} Axis of Evil. In October 2006 North Korea {{conducted}} its first nuclear weapons test. On May 27, 2009, North Korea announced it no <b>longer</b> <b>felt</b> bound by the armistice agreement. There were two isolated violent incidents in 2010, the ROKS Cheonan sinking (attributed to North Korea, despite denials) and the North Korean Bombardment of Yeonpyeong.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} On the Road brought Kerouac instant fame. His celebrity status brought {{publishers}} desiring unwanted manuscripts {{that were previously}} rejected before its publication. After nine months, he no <b>longer</b> <b>felt</b> safe in public. He was badly beaten by three men outside the San Remo Cafe at 189 Bleecker Street in New York City one night. Neal Cassady, possibly {{as a result of}} his new notoriety as the central character of the book, was set up and arrested for selling marijuana.|$|E
60|$|For a {{while she}} hesitated, then stepped quickly aside so that I could not see her; but I {{knew that she had}} not left me, that she was {{standing}} just behind me. And after waiting a moment <b>longer</b> I <b>felt</b> her fingers touching my skin, softly, trembling over my cheek as if a soft-winged moth had fluttered against it; then the slight aerial touch was gone, and she, too, moth-like, had vanished from my side.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am awfully {{sorry to}} wake you," [...] Ryan shouted, [...] "but {{you have had}} two hours of it, and I really cannot keep my eyes open any <b>longer.</b> I have <b>felt</b> myself going off, two or three times." ...|$|R
6000|$|Five {{weeks in}} the great {{metropolis}} had worked wonders in the boy. He no <b>longer</b> looked or <b>felt</b> [...] "green," [...] and he was fast acquiring a business way that was bound, sooner or later, to be highly beneficial to him.|$|R
25|$|Phase two then began. One no <b>longer</b> <b>felt</b> {{that the}} bowler was {{remotely}} {{interested in the}} stumps, but having scattered his fielders around the boundary, relied now, {{in the form of}} bait, on a species of poisoned chocolate. Bartlett paid scant heed to these exiled boundary creatures: at alarming rates he drove between, over, and if needs be, through them. He was a firm footed hitter, possessed of a long reach, and the trajectory of his drives was low and of a fearful power.|$|E
25|$|After a {{trade mission}} to China in 2002, Ventura {{announced}} that he would not run for a second term, stating that he no <b>longer</b> <b>felt</b> dedicated enough to his job to run again as well as what he viewed were constant attacks on his family by the media. Ventura accused the media of hounding him and his family for personal behavior and belief while neglecting coverage of important policy issues. He later told a reporter for The Boston Globe that he would have run for a second term if he had been single, citing the media's effect on his family life.|$|E
25|$|Eddie Kendricks became {{detached}} from the group after David Ruffin's firing and as the health of Paul Williams continued to fail. He regularly picked fights with Otis Williams and Melvin Franklin, which often became violent, and in addition, he preferred the ballad material from the earlier days and was uncomfortable with the psychedelic soul material the group was now performing. Kendricks rekindled his friendship with Ruffin, who persuaded him to go solo. He no <b>longer</b> <b>felt</b> he had a say in Otis Williams's handling {{of the group and}} was also convinced Motown's handling of the Temptations' finances was cheating the group out of money. Kendricks, being the only member to continue an alliance with Ruffin, also repeatedly suggested that Ruffin should be allowed back into the group, despite the other members' strong objections.|$|E
60|$|There {{was just}} room for {{him under the}} low cover of the sledge; he hesitated no <b>longer</b> now, he <b>felt</b> indeed as if nothing would tear him away from Gilda's side until she was safely home again in their father's arms.|$|R
60|$|Because she {{refrained from}} {{replying}} I was farther than ever from understanding her. How was I to divine what she felt? or whether any <b>longer</b> she <b>felt</b> at all? Here, in this costume {{of a woman}} of the world, with the string of pearls at her neck to give her the final touch of brilliancy, was a strange, new creature who baffled and silenced me.... We had not gone halfway across the room when she halted abruptly.|$|R
50|$|However, Mike Newmark {{writing for}} PopMatters was {{critical}} of the album's length, and felt that the music's ambient nature made it seem even <b>longer.</b> Newmark also <b>felt</b> that the sound of Pinhas' guitar and Merzbow's noise was dated and no longer innovative.|$|R
25|$|After {{meeting in}} Acre in June, the crusading kings Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany agreed with Melisende, Baldwin III {{and the major}} nobles of the kingdom to attack Damascus. Zengi's {{territory}} had been divided amongst his sons after his death, and Damascus no <b>longer</b> <b>felt</b> threatened, so an alliance had been made with Zengi's son Nur ad-Din, the emir of Aleppo. Perhaps remembering attacks launched on Jerusalem from Damascus in previous decades, Damascus {{seemed to be the}} best target for the crusade, rather than Aleppo or another city to the north which would have allowed for the recapture of Edessa. The subsequent Siege of Damascus was a complete failure; when the city seemed {{to be on the verge}} of collapse, the crusader army suddenly moved against another section of the walls, and were driven back. The crusaders retreated within three days. There were rumours of treachery and bribery, and Conrad III felt betrayed by the nobility of Jerusalem. Whatever the reason for the failure, the French and German armies returned home, and a few years later Damascus was firmly under Nur ad-Din's control.|$|E
25|$|Back at Westlake's lab, Dr. Westlake is {{conducting}} an experiment {{when the lights}} go out. Dr. Westlake and his assistant Yakatito, are astounded to find the synthetic skin is stable after 100 minutes. Westlake deduces that the synthetic skin is photosensitive. Their joy is short lived, when Durant and his crew show up and demand the Bellasarious Memorandum, which Westlake knows nothing about. While searching for the document, Durant and his gang kill Yakatito. They proceed to beat Westlake, burn his hands and dip his face in acid. After they find the document, they rig the lab to explode- leaving Julie to watch the explosion. The blast throws Westlake through the roof, into the river. Thought to be dead, he survives but is hideously burned. He is brought to a hospital and subjected to a radical treatment which cuts the nerves of the spinothalamic tract, so physical pain is no <b>longer</b> <b>felt.</b> However, he also loses his tactile sensation. The loss of this sensory input gives him enhanced strength due to adrenal overload and keeps his injuries from incapacitating him, but its absence also mentally destabilizes him.|$|E
25|$|Spiritual, emotional, and {{mathematical}} intellectuality, too, {{is behind the}} family group of Archipenko. This group, in plaster, might have been made of dough. It represents a featureless, large, strong male—one gets the impression of strength from humps and lumps—an impression of a female, less vivid, and the vague knowledge that a child is mixed up in the general embrace. The faces are rather blocky, the whole group with arms intertwined—arms that end suddenly, no hands, might be the sketch of a sculpture to be. But when one gets an insight it is intensely more interesting. It is, eventually, clear that in portraying his idea of family love the sculptor has built his figures with pyramidal strength; they are grafted together with love and geometric design, their limbs are bracings, ties of strength, they represent, not individuals, but the structure itself of family life. Not family life as one sees it, but the unseen, the deep emotional unseen, and in making his group when the sculptor found himself verging upon the seen—that is, when he no <b>longer</b> <b>felt</b> the unseen—he stopped. Therefore the hands were not essential. And this expression {{is made in the}} simplest way. Some will hoot at it, but others will feel the respect that is due one who simplifies and expresses the deep things of life. You may say that such is literature in marble—well, it is the most modern sculpture.|$|E
50|$|How {{long the}} {{condition}} {{has been going}} on and how it has changed since onset (better, worse, different symptoms), whether it has ever happened before, whether and how it may have changed since onset, and when the pain stopped if it is no <b>longer</b> currently being <b>felt.</b>|$|R
500|$|Two weeks {{following}} his announcement, Bayh {{withdrew from the}} race, citing that [...] "the odds were <b>longer</b> than I <b>felt</b> I could responsibly pursue". He further commented that a run would cause him to be [...] "absent from the Senate...instead of working {{to help the people}} of my state and the nation." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was a long}} pause, {{during which}} Wycherly thought he heard the hard but {{suppressed}} breathing of Mildred. To remain quiet any <b>longer,</b> he <b>felt</b> was as impossible as, indeed, his conscience told him was dishonourable, and he sprang along the path to ascend to the summer-house. At the first sound of his footstep, a faint cry escaped Mildred; but when Wycherly entered the pavilion, he found her face buried in her hands, and Dutton tottering forward, equally in surprise and alarm. As the circumstances would not admit of evasion, the young man threw aside all reserve, and spoke plainly.|$|R
