40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} Multimedia Delivery Service (MDS) for {{providing}} fluent multimedia services using multicast technique on the Head-end-Network. The implemented {{system is not}} conventional server-based multicast system but provides client-based on-demand {{one that has been}} lacked in conventional multicast delivery. The scheduler generates a multicast <b>group</b> <b>address</b> and port number when a client requests a service, then it sends them to multimedia server and client who request service. And then multimedia server transmits requested streams with a multicast <b>group</b> <b>address</b> and the client joins the group automatically. The scheduler assigns the same multicast <b>group</b> <b>address</b> when other clients request an identical multimedia within the same scheduling duration. Otherwise, it assigns another multicast <b>group</b> <b>address</b> to them. Key words...|$|R

50|$|An IP {{multicast}} <b>group</b> <b>address</b> {{is used by}} {{sources and}} the receivers to send and receive multicast messages. Sources use the <b>group</b> <b>address</b> as the IP destination address in their data packets. Receivers use this <b>group</b> <b>address</b> to inform the network that {{they are interested in}} receiving packets sent to that group. For example, if some content is associated with group 239.1.1.1, the source will send data packets destined to 239.1.1.1. Receivers for that content will inform the network that they are interested in receiving data packets sent to the group 239.1.1.1. The receiver joins 239.1.1.1. The protocol typically used by receivers to join a group is called the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP).|$|R

50|$|<b>Group</b> <b>address</b> {{and unknown}} {{destination}} individual frames are optimally transmitted to only {{members of the}} same Ethernet service. IEEE 802.1aq supports the creation of thousands of logical Ethernet services in the form of E-LINE, E-LAN or E-TREE constructs which are formed between non participating logical ports of the IEEE 802.1aq network. These <b>group</b> <b>address</b> packets are encapsulated with a PBB header which indicates the source participating address in the SA while the DA indicates the locally significant <b>group</b> <b>address</b> this frame should be forwarded on and which source bridge originated the frame. The IEEE 802.1aq multicast forwarding tables are created based on computations such that every bridge which is on the shortest path between a pair of bridges which are {{members of the same}} service group will create proper forwarding database (FDB) state to forward or replicate frames it receives to that members of that service group. Since the <b>group</b> <b>address</b> computation produce shortest path trees, there is only ever one copy of a multicast packet on any given link. Since only bridges on a shortest path between participating logical ports create forwarding database (FDB) state the multicast makes the efficient use of network resources.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present imss: IP Multicast Shortcut Service for ATM networks. imss pursues the "shortcut " routing {{paradigm}} {{in order to}} exploit the underlying ATM QoS and native routing mechanisms in the optimal way. imss is built on top of congress (CONnection oriented Group-address RESolution Service). Congress is an efficient native ATM protocol for resolution and management of multicast <b>group</b> <b>addresses</b> in a large ATM cloud. Congress resolves multicast <b>group</b> <b>addresses</b> and maintains their membership for applications. It is not designed to handle the applications' data-exchange. An imss extension at a multicast router uses the group membership information that it receives from congress, in order to open ATM connections that bypass ("shortcut") the IP routing mechanism. In this work we deal primarily {{with the implementation of}} imss. congress' design, however, will also be provided due to the non-triviality of <b>group</b> <b>address</b> resolution and maintenance problems that it addresses. 1 In [...] ...|$|R

50|$|In particular, in {{multicast}} socket networking, {{an example}} of promiscuous traffic is when a socket configured to listen on a specific multicast <b>address</b> <b>group</b> A with a specific port P, noted A:P, receives traffic from A:P but also from another multicast source. For instance, a socket is configured to receive traffic from the multicast <b>group</b> <b>address</b> 234.234.7.70, port 36000 (noted 234.234.7.70:36000), but receives traffic from both 234.234.7.70:36000 and 234.234.7.71:36000.|$|R
