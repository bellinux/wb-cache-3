25|$|Copper {{is one of}} {{the most}} noble metals. It will not be harmed by contact with other metals but it will cause {{corrosion}} to some other metals if contacted directly. The principal metals of concern regarding direct contact with copper are aluminum, <b>light-gauge</b> steel, and zinc. Aluminum and steel flashings and galvanized steel fasteners should not be used with copper. Runoff from a copper roof corrodes aluminum and steel guttering. It is not necessary to isolate copper from lead, tin or many stainless steels under most circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Constructed of <b>light-gauge</b> painted sheet steel, Joroleman {{designed}} his mailbox with an arched, tunnel-shape roof, which prevented excessive {{accumulation of}} rainwater or snow while resisting deformation. The tunnel top also simplified {{the process of}} mass production by {{eliminating the need for}} precise sheet metal bends. Stamped and formed metal straps riveted to the arched opening and the mailbox door served as a door latching mechanism, while a rotating red semaphore flag mounted on a shaft attached {{to the side of the}} mailbox served to signal the approaching mailman if there was outgoing mail inside. Fitted with a crimped or braze-on rear steel panel and a false floor to keep its contents dry in inclement or humid weather, the Joroleman mailbox required only two rivets, three axle bolts, and four screws and nuts for completion. Durable and inexpensive, the popularity of the Joroleman mailbox was further enhanced by a decision not to patent the design, but to make its specifications known to all potential manufacturers for competitive sale. Adopted across the United States, it has remained the top-selling mailbox since its introduction, and was also widely used in Canada prior to that country's decision to eliminate individual curbside delivery to rural residents.|$|E
5000|$|Ralph Keeling {{developed}} his first scientific instrument, a <b>light-gauging</b> interferometer for the accurate measurement of atmospheric oxygen, {{as part of}} his Ph.D. research. By October 25, 1986, Keeling had developed a working prototype, a stainless steel box about seven feet tall, with a glass front. [...] Inside the box, light beams shine through the gas molecules of air samples. Keeling's interferometer measures the speed of light at different wavelengths and determines the specific composition of the air and its oxygen content based on tiny variations in speed. The instrument Keeling developed was able to measure oxygen at a far more precise level than anything previously created, detecting differences of a few molecules per million.|$|R
2500|$|In any case, {{he decided}} to {{continue}} playing left-handed. To do so, he fitted homemade thimbles to his injured fingers to extend and protect them; the thimbles were made from an old Fairy Liquid bottle – [...] "melted it down, got a hot soldering iron and shaped it like a finger" [...] – and cut sections from a leather jacket to cover his new homemade prosthetic, which created two technical problems. First, the thimbles prevented him from feeling the strings, causing a tendency to press down very hard on them. [...] Secondly, he had difficulty bending strings, leading him to seek <b>light-gauge</b> guitar strings {{to make it easier}} to do so. However, Iommi recalls that such strings were not manufactured at the time, so he used banjo strings instead, until around 1970–71 when Picato Strings began making <b>light-gauge</b> guitar strings. Furthermore, he used the injured fingers predominantly for fretting chords rather than single-note solos. In 1974, Iommi told Guitar Player magazine that the thimbles [...] "helped with his technique" [...] because he had to use his little finger more than he had before the accident. Later, he also began tuning his guitar to lower pitches, sometimes as far as three semitones below standard guitar tuning (e.g., on [...] "Children of the Grave", [...] "Lord of this World", and [...] "Into the Void", all on the album Master of Reality). Although Iommi states that the main purpose of doing so was to create a [...] "bigger, heavier sound", slackening the strings makes it easier to bend them.|$|E

50|$|Washington Steel began {{production}} in 1947, with a 39-inch Z-mill much wider than any previously produced (it cost $278,000, installed).

5000|$|The {{effect of}} adding {{multiple}} layers of gypsum wallboard to a frame also varies depending on the framing type and configuration. Doubling the mass of a partition does not double the STC, as the STC is calculated from a non-linear decibel sound transmission loss measurement. So, whereas installing an additional layer of gypsum wallboard to a <b>light-gauge</b> (25-ga. or lighter) steel stud partition will result in about a 5 STC-point increase, doing the same on single wood or single heavy-gauge steel will result in only 2 to 3 additional STC points. Adding a second additional layer (to the already 3-layer system) does not result in as drastic an STC change as the first additional layer. The effect of additional gypsum wallboard layers on double- and staggered-stud partitions {{is similar to that}} of <b>light-gauge</b> steel partitions. Due to increased mass, poured concrete and concrete blocks typically achieve higher STC values (in the mid STC 40s to the mid STC 50s) than equally thick framed walls. [...] However the additional weight, added complexity of construction, and poor thermal insulation tend to limit masonry wall partitions as a viable sound isolation solution in many building construction projects. Temperate climates and hurricane- or tornado-prone areas may, however, require the use of masonry walls for structural stability.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, modern house-construction {{techniques}} include light-frame construction (in {{areas with}} access to supplies of wood) and adobe or sometimes rammed-earth construction (in arid regions with scarce wood-resources). Some areas use brick almost exclusively, and quarried stone has long provided walling. To some extent, aluminum and steel have displaced some traditional building materials. Increasingly popular alternative construction materials include insulating concrete forms (foam forms filled with concrete), structural insulated panels (foam panels faced with oriented strand board or fiber cement), and <b>light-gauge</b> steel framing and heavy-gauge steel framing.|$|E
5000|$|King was left-handed, {{but usually}} played {{right-handed}} guitars flipped over upside-down. He used a dropped open tuning, possibly more than one, as reports vary: (C#-G#-B-E-G#-C#) or open E-minor (C-B-E-G-B-E) or open F (C-F-C-F-A-D). He {{never used the}} sixth string. Steve Cropper (who played rhythm guitar on many of King's Stax sessions), told Guitar Player magazine that King tuned his guitar to C-B-E-F#-B-E (low to high). The luthier Dan Erlewine said King tuned to C-F-C-F-A-D with <b>light-gauge</b> strings (0.009", 0.012", 0.024" [...] wound, 0.028", 0.038", 0.050"). The lighter-gauge strings were a factor in King's string-bending technique.|$|E
5000|$|Where stucco is to {{be applied}} to a {{structure}} of wood-framing or <b>light-gauge</b> steel framing, the framing is protected from moisture damage by applying a cement based primer, or a vapor-permeable, water-resistant weather barrier; typically an asphalt-saturated paper or one of a variety of manufactured plastic-based sheets, known as [...] "building wraps" [...] or [...] "stucco wraps". The properties of the weather barrier must not only protect the framing from rain and moisture, {{but at the same time}} allow the free passage of any water vapor generated inside the building to escape through the wall.|$|E
5000|$|A {{staple remover}} is {{a device that}} allows for the quick removal of a staple from a {{material}} without causing damage. The best-known form of staple remover, designed for <b>light-gauge</b> staples, consists essentially of a) two opposing, pivot-mounted pairs of thin, steep wedges and b) a spring that returns the device to the open position after use. Although a simple metal wedge {{can be used for}} the same purpose, and although some staplers (especially small ones about 1.5 in long) feature such a wedge at their hinge end, use of the wedge tends to tear fragile papers.|$|E
50|$|For example, in the Rochester, New York, area, {{where the}} price of {{electric}} energy is four times that of natural gas before taking demand charges into consideration, an autoclave six feet in diameter and twenty-four feet long (with a <b>light-gauge</b> interior wall) would cost about $2,000 a month in demand charges plus an average of $14 an hour in energy when running. The demand charges, incurred {{as soon as the}} autoclave is turned on, even if for only a moment, would equal the purchase price of the autoclave in only a few years.

50|$|Copper {{has a high}} conductivity. Annealed copper is the {{international}} standard to which all other electrical conductors are compared. The main grade of copper used for electrical applications, such as building wire, motor windings, cables and busbars, is electrolytic-tough pitch (ETP) copper (CW004A or ASTM designation C100140). This copper has an electrical conductivity of at least 100% IACS (International Annealed Copper Standard). If high conductivity copper must be welded or brazed or used in a reducing atmosphere, then oxygen-free high conductivity copper (CW008A or ASTM designation C10100) may be used. Because of its ease of connection by soldering or clamping, copper {{is still the most}} common choice for most <b>light-gauge</b> wires.|$|E

50|$|When {{a string}} is bent, the sound it creates is much {{smoother}} {{than would be}} otherwise, even using other legato techniques such as hammer-ons, pull-offs, or finger slides.

Some masters of string bending on guitar include David Gilmour, Tony Iommi, Brian May, T-Bone Walker, B. B. King, and Eric Clapton, as well as many other blues, country, and jazz-influenced guitarists. To facilitate his extensive string bending, Clapton used to substitute an unwound banjo string for the third string on his guitar. At that time, no set of <b>light-gauge</b> strings with an unwound third string was available.|$|E
50|$|The {{western part}} of the district, the Stave Valley, is largely rural and forested but its {{watercourse}} is home to what was the largest hydroelectric project in British Columbia until the Bridge River Power Project opened in 1961. It was built by the British Columbia Electric Railway (BCER) to provide power to the electric street railway and interurban system in Vancouver. The Stave Falls Power Co. operated a <b>light-gauge</b> railway for passenger and freight service up the lower canyon of the river to the dam at Stave Falls. During the construction of the Ruskin Dam (completed 1931) the railway was rebuilt at a higher elevation so as to skirt the new Hayward Lake reservoir. The rail line has long been discontinued, but the old grade and its trestles are now part of a recreation trail circling the reservoir.|$|E

The company also offers tin mill products, including tin plate, tin free steel, low tin coated steel, and black plate products. CSN also mines iron ore, limestone, and dolomite, and maintains strategic investments in railroads and power supply companies. The company sells its steel products to customers in Brazil and 71 other countries in North America, Europe, and Asia through its sales force and distributors.

5000|$|Adding {{absorptive}} {{materials to}} the interior surfaces of rooms (e.g. fabric-faced fiberglass panels, thick curtains) {{will result in a}} decrease of reverberated sound energy within the room. However, absorptive interior surface treatments do not significantly improve the sound isolation from one room to another through demising partitions over the typical frequency range measured currently. Installing absorptive insulation (e.g., fiberglass batts, blow-in cellulose, mineral fiber batts) into the wall or ceiling cavities affects the sound isolation of the partition to varying degrees, depending on the framing configuration and joist or stud depth. For example, the presence of type of insulation in single 2x4 wood stud framing spaced 16" [...] (406 mm) on-center results in only a few STC points. In contrast, adding standard fiberglass insulation to an otherwise empty cavity in <b>light-gauge</b> (25-gauge or lighter) steel stud partitions can result in a nearly 10 STC-point improvement. As the stud gauge becomes heavier, the presence and type of insulation matters less.|$|E

50|$|Cinderella Castle is {{designed}} to reflect the late-Gothic, flamboyant style of the 1400s. Unlike Disneyland's castle, no gold is used on the exterior; all gold colors are anodized aluminum. Despite appearances, no bricks were used in its construction; the inner structure is constructed of six hundred tons of steelbraced frame construction, and a 10 in reinforced concrete wall encircles the structure to the full height of the outermost stone-like walls. All of the steel and concrete works are supported on a concrete drilled caisson foundation. Much less fiberglass is used than is popularly supposed. Rather, most of the exterior is a thick, very hard fiber-reinforced gypsum plaster that is supported by <b>light-gauge</b> metal studs. Most fiberglass work is reserved for the exterior walls of more ornate upper towers. The roofs are not fiberglass, either. They are shingled in {{the same type of}} plastic that computer monitor shells are made from, attached to a cone of light gauge steel sheeting over the steel sub-frame. These towers were lifted by crane, then welded and bolted permanently to the main structure. Contrary to a popular legend, the castle cannot be taken apart or moved in any way {{in the event of a}} hurricane. It would take months to disassemble, it would be too dangerous to operate the 300 ft crane required in windy conditions, and there would have to be a safer building to keep it in. As with every other building at Walt Disney World, it was simpler and safer to design it to handle a hurricane. It can easily withstand the 125 mph (175 km/h) design wind speeds in Central Florida with a great deal of strength in reserve.|$|E
