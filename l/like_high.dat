5|$|Developers {{working on}} Oblivion focused on {{providing}} a tighter storyline, with fewer filler quests and more developed characters. The developers {{sought to make}} information in the game world more accessible to players, making the game easier {{to pick up and}} play. Oblivion features improved AI (courtesy of Bethesda's proprietary Radiant AI), improved physics (courtesy of the Havok physics engine), and impressive graphics, taking advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines <b>like</b> <b>high</b> dynamic range rendering (HDR) and specular mapping. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the creation of Oblivions terrain, leading to landscapes that are more complex and realistic than those of past titles, with less of a drain on Bethesda's staff.|$|E
5|$|The dispute did not delay work. Although {{progress}} on the reactor design at Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont was not sufficiently advanced to accurately predict {{the scope of the}} project, a start was made in April 1943 on facilities for an estimated 25,000 workers, half of whom were expected to live on-site. By July 1944, some 1,200 buildings had been erected and nearly 51,000 people were living in the construction camp. As area engineer, Matthias exercised overall control of the site. At its peak, the construction camp was the third most populous town in Washington state. Hanford operated a fleet of over 900 buses, more than the city of Chicago. Like Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, Richland was a gated community with restricted access, but it looked more like a typical wartime American boomtown: the military profile was lower, and physical security elements <b>like</b> <b>high</b> fences, towers, and guard dogs were less evident.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{have shown}} a {{damaging}} relation between higher amounts of alcohol consumption and organ damage. Cardiovascular problems <b>like</b> <b>high</b> blood pressure, cardiomyopathy and heart attacks {{have been attributed to}} excessive alcohol consumption. Beyond the circulatory system, kidney and liver disease is also attributed to alcohol consumption. Effects on brain function have been found, for example memory loss reduced intellectual ability, reduced brain size and coordination.|$|E
25|$|Description: Dramatic mezzo-sopranos have ranges {{very similar}} to a {{dramatic}} soprano. The main difference is the endurance and ease {{in which the two}} voice-types sing – a mezzo will concentrate singing most of the time in her middle and low registers and will go up to notes <b>like</b> <b>high</b> B-flat only at the dramatic climax. Consequently, many dramatic mezzo-sopranos have success in singing some dramatic soprano roles that are written with a lower tessitura.|$|E

25|$|Soulslike {{games are}} a {{relatively}} new genre born due to popularity of the Souls series. Those games generally have common elements <b>like</b> <b>high</b> difficulty, high-risk combat with hard-hitting enemies, sparse checkpoints, and enemies dropping souls (or some other resource used for upgrading stats and/or weapons that is lost upon death), but the player has one chance to regain the dropped souls if they can reach the place of their death without dying again. Examples {{of this type of}} game are: Dragon's Dogma, Lords of the Fallen, Bound by Flame, Bloodborne, DarkMaus, Nioh, The Surge, Ashen.|$|E
25|$|The village's {{attorney}} {{determined that}} two businesses in Hoffman Estates {{were affected by}} the ordinance. One of them, the Flipside, had been doing business on West Higgins Road in the village for three years, selling primarily recorded music and accessories for that, as well as jewelry and novelty devices. In {{one section of the}} store it sold paraphernalia, accompanied by books such as A Child's Garden of Grass and Marijuana Grower's Guide and magazines <b>like</b> <b>High</b> Times, Rolling Stone and National Lampoon, which often carried articles either discussing drug culture or casually depicting illegal drug use.|$|E

However, experts from the Institute of Environmental Science & Engineering at the Nanyang Technological University said that only some of these products, <b>like</b> <b>High</b> Efficiency Particulate air filters, would effectively remove small particles from air. Other kinds of air purifiers like ionizing purifiers gave off ozone which could cause symptoms similar to those caused by the haze. The experts recommended regularly cleaning the filter media and opening windows to get some fresh air at night.|$|E

She next starred in the dramatic thriller Silence Becomes You, which received a DVD release in October 2005. Silverstone did a pilot episode in 2005 with FOX called Queen B, in which she played a former high school prom queen who has discovered that the real world is nothing <b>like</b> <b>high</b> school, but it was not picked up for production. In 2006, she starred in an ABC pilot called Pink Collar as a woman working in a law firm, but like Queen B, this pilot was not picked up to series.|$|E
25|$|High Point was {{an early}} center for the {{development}} of the furniture industry in the South. Functional furniture had been produced on a small scale since the 17th century by artisans of English ancestry who had settled in North Carolina. As the farming landscape of the South began to change with the end of the Civil War and slavery, cheap labor became available during the Reconstruction Era. The North Carolina furniture industry gained momentum in the late 19th century, and developers were attracted to High Point for its location, transportation, and cheap labor. The city was situated ideally in the center of the Piedmont region with access to vast hardwood forests in the central and western parts of the state. High Point, located at the junction of the railroad and a main state road, was an ideal centralized shipping point for the southern market. An agricultural depression of the 1890s drove farm workers from the countryside to developing towns <b>like</b> <b>High</b> Point looking for industrial jobs.|$|E
25|$|The {{franchise}} {{celebrated its}} 10th anniversary in the OHL in 2004–05. The {{race for the}} central division title was close the entire year. By {{the end of the}} season the difference between first and fourth place was only four points. The Colts finished second in the central division; three points behind leaders Mississauga IceDogs, and one point ahead of Brampton Battalion and Sudbury Wolves. Second year player Bryan Little continued to build upon the success of his rookie season, scoring 36 goals and 32 assists for a total of 68 points. Third year Colt Hunter Tremblay was not that far behind, scoring a total of 62 points. Filling out the Colts offence were the likes of Travis Fuller, Dan Speer, and B.J. Crombeen. Rookie defencemen Andrew Marshall, Nathan Martine, Todd Perry, and Nick Plastino, along with local brothers Andrew Hotham, and Scott Hotham would protect the Colts goal all season. Throughout the season, the Colts would make trades that brought in guys <b>like</b> <b>high</b> scoring overager Rob Hisey from the Erie Otters, young role players like Mike Roelofsen and Daniel Lombardi, and a proven goalie in Dan LaCosta. Heading into the playoffs the Colts would look to have plenty of promise for the present, as well as the future. In the playoffs that year the Colts lost a disappointing first round series to the eventual Memorial Cup semi-finalist Ottawa 67's.|$|E

500|$|The {{performance}} of the duet [...] "Take Me or Leave Me" [...] elicited praise from Brown and Fallon, who both deemed it {{the highlight of the}} episode. Brown noted that [...] "it had that addictive Glee quality of actually feeling <b>like</b> <b>high</b> school, and watching Mercedes and Rachel have a blast blasting each other was a treat." [...] Gonzalez gave the duet a [...] "B", as, while there was [...] "so much to swoon for", she is more partial to ballads because they [...] "discourage oversinging throughout the entire song". Futterman wrote that while Mercedes had more sass than Rachel, [...] "both ladies sang". VanDerWerff did not see how the song was relevant, and felt that Michele's voice was ill-suited to it.|$|E
500|$|It also {{incorporates}} a Queen-referencing chorus: [...] "I {{want you to}} rock me, yeah, I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal, show me you care." [...] The track's lyricism regards a nostalgic message about a former significant other and a blatant double entendre for sexual intercourse. In the regard to its double entendre, Grigg noted, [...] "but at the same time, there's a vulnerability in it that's, like, so sweet for girls. It's a little self-deprecating. There's {{not a lot of}} overt machismo in the song". [...] "I approached it <b>like</b> <b>high</b> school," [...] said [...] Hollander: [...] "On the first record, they were freshmen, innocent and wide-eyed. Now it's sophomore year, there are parties and driver’s licenses, and the world is theirs for the taking. That's what I wanted to capture".|$|E

500|$|After {{experiencing}} mixed fortunes in {{his acting}} career after leaving Casualty, Mantle agreed {{to return to}} the role as Dr Mike Barratt in Holby City in 1999. His abilities as a dramatic actor were praised by Christopher Matthew of the Daily Mail who said in 2000, [...] "Even the great Mike Barratt (Clive Mantle), a dynamo in his Casualty days, manages to make eating a yoghurt seem <b>like</b> <b>high</b> drama." [...] Claire Stoker of Liverpool Echo said that [...] "Clive will always be the best consultant Holby had ever had." [...] Mantle finally left his role in Holby City after 32 episodes in 2001. That year, Mantle participated in a charity trek of the Annapurna circuit in the Himalayas and to Everest Base Camp, reaching 18,420ft in aid of Hope and Homes for Children. In 2002, Mantle appeared in an episode of Heartbeat.|$|E
500|$|... "The Old Man and the Key" [...] {{was written}} by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Lance Kramer. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on March 10, 2002. The idea for the episode was pitched by Vitti, who was inspired by an article about senior homes. The article described senior homes as being a lot <b>like</b> <b>high</b> schools, in that there are popular and unpopular people, and that those who, for example, own a car are [...] "like kings". Vitti suggested that the episode should be that [...] "Grampa's life [...] basically {{like that of a}} teenager", with Homer acting as if he was Grampa's father. The Souvenir Jackitos, who challenge Grampa to a death race in the episode, were conceived from an observation by the writers. The writers argued that the only ones buying expensive trademarked jackets are old people who want to appear younger.|$|E
500|$|By contrast, Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan {{offered a}} mixed opinion of 5.9 out of 10, stating that {{on its own}} the album is good, but it pales in {{comparison}} to an album <b>like</b> <b>High</b> on Fire's Snakes for the Divine.

Nonetheless, he did compliment Vince Nudo for his vocals on [...] "Lunar", which he favorably compared to Black Sabbath, and also compared [...] "Lady Killer" [...] to Judas Priest. The Boston Phoenix reviewer Mikael Wood gave the album a star and a half out of four, and wrote that despite the cleverness behind the album's title, the songs within were empty, and while fans of the style would be comfortable with it, [...] "Everybody else should seek out Hello Master." ...|$|E
