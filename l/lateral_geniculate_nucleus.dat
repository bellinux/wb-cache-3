Photoreceptors in the retina transduce the sensory stimulus of light into an electrical nerve signal that {{is sent to the}} visual cortex in the occipital lobe. Vision from the left visual field is received {{on the right side of}} each retina (and vice versa) and passes through the optic nerve until some information changes sides, so that all information about one side of the visual field passes through tracts in the opposite side of the brain.

25|$|The eye is {{connected}} to the visual cortex by the optic nerve coming {{out of the back of}} the eye. The two optic nerves come together behind the eyes at the optic chiasm, where about half of the fibers from each eye cross over to the opposite side and join fibers from the other eye representing the corresponding visual field, the combined nerve fibers from both eyes forming the optic tract. This ultimately forms the physiological basis of binocular vision. The tracts project to a relay station in the midbrain called the <b>lateral</b> <b>geniculate</b> <b>nucleus,</b> part of the thalamus, and then to the visual cortex along a collection of nerve fibers called the optic radiation.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} the CT and MR {{characteristics of the}} brains of infants who have suffered profound asphyxia and correlate those characteristics with pathophysiologic processes. Methods: MR and CT scans of 16 patients who suffered profound hypoxic-ischemic injury in the perinatal (12 patients) and postnatal (4 patients) periods were retrospectively reviewed {{in a search for}} characteristic imaging features. Results: Injury in the perinatal period: subacute MR showed short T 1 and T 2 in the ventral lateral thalami, posterolateral lentiform nuclei, posterior mesencephali, and hippocampi; MR 1 to 16 years after injury showed atrophy or T 2 prolongation in the aforementioned regions, the <b>lateral</b> <b>geniculate</b> <b>nuclei</b> and perirolandic cerebral cortex. Asphyxia later in infancy: subacute MR showed T 2 prolongation in the corpus striatum and most of the cerebral cortex (perirolandic sparing); MR weeks to months later showed atrophy of the aforemen-tioned areas, the <b>lateral</b> <b>geniculate</b> <b>nuclei</b> and hippocampi. Acute CT in both groups showed basal ganglia hypodensity. Conclusions: The injury patterns observed in neonates and infants with profound hypoxic-ischemic injury vary with the age of the patient {{at the time of the}} injury. The change in pattern of damage is suggested to be the result of structural and physiologic changes in the maturing brain. The patterns appear to be consistent and are well demonstrated by MR...|$|R

Molecular cues are one of the key factors to guide the wiring and refinement of the image-forming visual circuit during pre- and post-embryonic stages. Distinct molecular cues are involved in different developmental stages and nucleus, suggesting diverse guidance mechanisms.

25|$|REM {{sleep is}} {{also related to}} the firing of ponto-geniculo-occipital waves (also called phasic {{activity}} or PGO waves) and activity in the cholinergic ascending arousal system. The PGO waves have been recorded in the <b>lateral</b> <b>geniculate</b> <b>nucleus</b> and occipital cortex during the pre-REM period and are thought to represent dream content. The greater signal-to-noise ratio in the LG cortical channel suggests that visual imagery in dreams may appear before full development of REM sleep, but this {{has not yet been}} confirmed. PGO waves may also play a role in development and structural maturation of brain, as well as long term potentiation in immature animals, {{based on the fact that}} there is high PGO activity during sleep in the developmental brain.|$|E
25|$|A neuron's {{ability to}} {{generate}} and propagate an action potential changes during development. How much the membrane potential of a neuron changes {{as the result of}} a current impulse is a function of the membrane input resistance. As a cell grows more channels are added to the membrane causing a decrease in input resistance. A mature neuron also undergoes shorter changes in membrane potential in response to synaptic currents. Neurons from a ferret <b>lateral</b> <b>geniculate</b> <b>nucleus</b> have a longer time constant and larger voltage deflection at P0 than they do at P30. One consequence of the decreasing action potential duration is that the fidelity of the signal can be preserved in response to high frequency stimulation. Immature neurons are more prone to synaptic depression than potentiation after high frequency stimulation.|$|E
25|$|The {{superior}} colliculus (SC) or optic tectum (OT) {{is part of}} the tectum, located in the midbrain, superior to the brainstem and inferior to the thalamus. It contains seven layers of alternating white and grey matter, of which the superficial contain topographic maps of the visual field; and deeper layers contain overlapping spatial maps of the visual, auditory and somatosensory modalities. The structure receives afferents directly from the retina, as well as from various regions of the cortex (primarily the occipital lobe), the spinal cord and the inferior colliculus. It sends efferents to the spinal cord, cerebellum, thalamus and occipital lobe via the <b>lateral</b> <b>geniculate</b> <b>nucleus</b> (LGN). The structure contains a high proportion of multisensory neurons and plays a role in the motor control of orientation behaviours of the eyes, ears and head.|$|E
50|$|The eye {{pathology}} {{is limited}} to the retinal ganglion cell layer especially the maculopapillary bundle. Degeneration is evident from the retinal ganglion cell bodies to the axonal pathways leading to the <b>lateral</b> <b>geniculate</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Experimental evidence reveals impaired glutamate transport and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) causing apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells. Also, experiments suggest that normal non LHON affected retinal ganglion cells produce less of the potent superoxide radical than other normal central nervous system neurons. Viral vector experiments which augment superoxide dismutase 2 in LHON cybrids or LHON animal models or use of exogenous glutathione in LHON cybrids have been shown to rescue LHON affected retinal ganglion cells from apoptotic death. These experiments may in part explain the death of LHON affected retinal ganglion cells in preference to other central nervous system neurons which also carry LHON affected mitochondria.|$|R

In order to determine the possible mechanisms leading to bilateral retinitis, we studied the pathways by which herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) is propagated from one retina to the other after intravitreal injection in mice. HSV- 1 strain SC 16 (90 p. f. u.) was injected into the vitreous body of the left eye of BALB/c mice. Animals were sacrificed 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 days post-inoculation (p. i.). Histological sections were studied by immunochemical staining. Primary retinitis in the inoculated eye (beginning 1 day p. i.) was followed by contralateral retinitis (in the uninoculated eye) starting at 3 days p. i. Infected neurons of central visual pathway <b>nuclei</b> (<b>lateral</b> <b>geniculate</b> <b>nuclei,</b> suprachiasmatic nuclei and pretectal areas) were detected at 4 days p. i. Iris and ciliary body infection was minimal early on, but became extensive thereafter and was accompanied by the infection of connected sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways. The pattern of virus propa-gation over time suggests that the onset of contralateral retinitis was mediated by local (non-synaptic) transfer in the optic chiasm from infected to uninfected axons of the optic nerves.

40|$|AbstractThe {{additivity}} assumption {{relates to}} the various stereo-disparity components in the vertical and horizontal meridians, {{each of which is}} assumed to be independent of the other, with the total disparity in each dimension being the linear sum of the separate components. Information about the position of the eyes provided by the corollary discharge leads to compensatory changes in the <b>lateral</b> <b>geniculate</b> <b>nuclei</b> whereby the angle of gaze disparity component at retinal level is offset by equal and opposite changes at geniculate level. These geniculate changes concern only eye position. Changes in the retinal images such as those produced by lenses (i. e. induced effect) are passed on to the cortex without modification at the geniculate level.

25|$|The nucleus geniculatus lateralis {{is made up}} of {{different}} cellular strata separated by lamellae, parallel to the surface. The stratae 1 and 2, the most ventral, are magnocellular.

The nasal component of the optic nerves (the axons issued from the nasal field of the retina of both sides) crosses at the chiasma.The axons of the temporal field do not cross. This is very important in clinical neurology. After the chiasma, axons form the visual tracts turning around the peduncles and arriving into the polar anterior part of the geniculate nucleus. Retinal axons from the controlateral retina end in stratae 1,4 and 6. Those from the ipsilateral retina end in 2,3 and 5.

25|$|Researchers {{have checked}} the BOLD signal against both signals from {{implanted}} electrodes (mostly in monkeys) and signals of field potentials (that is the electric or magnetic field from the brain's activity, measured outside the skull) from EEG and MEG. The local field potential, which includes both post-neuron-synaptic activity and internal neuron processing, better predicts the BOLD signal. So the BOLD contrast reflects mainly the inputs to a neuron and the neuron's integrative processing within its body, and less the output firing of neurons. In humans, electrodes can be implanted only {{in patients who}} need surgery as treatment, but evidence suggests a similar relationship {{at least for the}} auditory cortex and the primary visual cortex. Activation locations detected by BOLD fMRI in cortical areas (brain surface regions) are known to tally with CBF-based functional maps from PET scans. Some regions just a few millimeters in size, such as the <b>lateral</b> <b>geniculate</b> <b>nucleus</b> (LGN) of the thalamus, which relays visual inputs from the retina to the visual cortex, have been shown to generate the BOLD signal correctly when presented with visual input. Nearby regions such as the pulvinar nucleus were not stimulated for this task, indicating millimeter resolution for the spatial extent of the BOLD response, at least in thalamic nuclei.

40|$|Several {{behavioral}} {{studies have}} shown that developmental dyslexics do poorly in tests requiring rapid visual processing. In primates fast, low-contrast visual information is carried by the magnocellular subdivision of the visual pathway, and slow, high-contrast information is carried by the parvocellular division. In this study, we found that dyslexic subjects showed diminished visually evoked potentials to rapid, low-contrast stimuli but normal responses to slow or high-contrast stimuli. The abnormalities in the dyslexic subjects' evoked potentials were consistent with a defect in the magnocellular pathway at the level of visual area 1 or earlier. We then compared the <b>lateral</b> <b>geniculate</b> <b>nuclei</b> from five dyslexic brains to five control brains and found abnormalities in the magnocellular, but not the parvocellular, layers.

Ganglion cell activity was monitored as synaptic (S) potentials recorded extracellularly in the <b>lateral</b> <b>geniculate</b> <b>nuclei</b> of anesthetized and paralyzed monkeys. Receptive field center and surround regions of magnocellularly-projecting (M) and parvocellularly-projecting (P) cells increase in area with distance from the fovea, with the center radii of M cells being about twice those of neighboring P cells. Peak sensitivities of center and surround regions are inversely proportional to the regions' areas, so that integrated contrast sensitivities (contrast gains) are constant across the visual field, with the gain of M cells being, on average, six times that of P cells. For both M and P cells, the average ratio of surround/center gain is 0. 55. Constant gain of P cells across the visual field is achieved by increasing sensitivity to stimuli falling on the peripheral retina to an extent that counteracts the aberations introduced by the eye's optics...|$|R

The cells in these layers are organized in a way that forms a map of the visual field. They are organized according to what direction each cell moves the eye. It has been found that activation of specific cells is directed by where objects in the environment are located in the visual field. [...] Once a new object is detected, the cells that fire the strongest to stimuli within this specific area of the visual field will fire, causing the eyes to move and focus on this object.

2500|$|In animals, the {{appearance}} of ponto-geniculo-occipital waves (PGO waves) is related {{to that of the}} bioelectric outputs of rapid eye movements. These waves are most clearly seen during the transition from non-REM to REM sleep. Although these phasic waves are observed in many portions of the animal brain, they are most noticeable in the pons, lateral geniculate bodies, and the occipital cortex. Peigneux et al., 2006, reported that the <b>lateral</b> <b>geniculate</b> <b>nucleus</b> and occipital cortex display higher levels of activity during REM sleep than during wakefulness. This would add to the theory that activation in these areas is similar to PGO wave activation in animals. Pontine waves are commonly seen in animals as a mechanism to help facilitate learning and memory consolidation. [...] An improvement on task performance was seen to be a result of increased P waves between REM sleep sessions. In a study using post learning REM sleep deprivation the effects of stimulating the P wave generator (located in the pontine tegmentum) of a rat were observed. Two groups of rats underwent an avoidance learning task and then allowed a sleep period while another group of rats were deprived sleep. When comparing the two groups the sleep deprived rats showed a significant deficit in learning from having not undergone REM sleep. In another rat group, the P wave generator was stimulated using a carbachol injection and the rats then underwent a sleep deprivation stage. When these rats were again tested on their learning it was shown that activation of the P wave generator during sleep deprivation resulted in normal learning being achieved. This would point {{to the fact that the}} activation of P waves, even without REM sleep, was enough to enhance the memory processes that would not normally have happened.|$|E

Furthermore, it is also unclear whether these age-related changes are specific to the macaque auditory system or are generalized to other sensory systems. To address these questions, the PV immunoreactivity of the medial and <b>lateral</b> <b>geniculate</b> <b>nuclei</b> (LGN) from seven rhesus macaques {{ranging in age from}} 15 to 35 was assessed.

Together, these results suggest that the MGN shows age-related increases in PV expression as is seen throughout the macaque ascending auditory system, and that the analogous region of the visual system shows smaller increases. We conclude that, while there are some similarities between sensory systems, the age-related neurochemical changes seen throughout the macaque auditory system cannot be fully generalized to other sensory systems...|$|R
