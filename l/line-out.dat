5|$|In 1978, Graham Mourie captained New Zealand {{to their}} first Grand Slam, {{including}} a 13–12 victory over Wales. That game generated controversy after New Zealand won {{as the result of}} a late penalty. Lock Andy Haden had dived out of a <b>line-out</b> in an attempt to earn a penalty, but referee Roger Quittenden insisted the penalty was against Welsh lock Geoff Wheel for jumping off the shoulder of Frank Oliver. New Zealand's only loss on the tour was the famous 12–0 defeat by Irish province Munster at Thomond Park. Later a play which focused on the loss was written by John Breen, called Alone it Stands.|$|E

5|$|The English {{played the}} first half with the wind behind them and their nine-man scrum {{dominated}} the smaller Welsh pack. At half time Wales were 7–0 down following tries from Frederick Lohden and Howard Marshall and a conversion from England captain Andrew Stoddart. The second half started poorly for Wales when Marshall scored a second try following excellent English forward pressure. The game turned not long after: the English forwards could not maintain the pace they had set in {{the first half}} of the game, and began to slow. Then Welsh forward Charles Nicholl broke through a <b>line-out</b> with the ball, transferred it to Hannan, who passed to Gould at the half way line. Gould evaded both Alderson and Lockwood before outpacing Edwin Field to score beneath the posts. Bancroft converted. A near identical move resulted in Conway Rees then releasing Cardiff wing Norman Biggs who scored with a run from the half-way line, though this time the conversion missed.|$|E
25|$|A <b>line-out</b> {{consists}} {{of at least}} two players from each team standing in a two straight lines between five and fifteen metres from, and at right angles to, the scoring bay. The gap between the two teams must be 1 metre and the opposing team cannot have more players in the <b>line-out</b> than the team that was last in 'fluid possession'. One player from each team has to stand two metres back from the <b>line-out</b> to receive the ball and the opposing team must have a player standing {{at the front of the}} <b>line-out</b> two metres from the centre of the <b>line-out.</b> The player throwing the ball stands outside the field of play and must throw it at least five metres down the centre of the <b>line-out.</b> If the throw in is incorrect the opposing team has the choice of taking a scrum fifteen metres from the sideline or throwing the ball in themselves. The player throwing the ball in must not delay or pretend to throw the ball in. Players not taking part in the <b>line-out</b> must stand back ten metres or on the goal line if that is closer.|$|E
25|$|Different {{positions}} on the field suit certain skill sets and body types, generally leading to players specialising in {{a limited number of}} positions. Each position has certain roles to play on the field, although most have been established through convention rather than law. During general play, {{as long as they are}} not offside, the players may be positioned anywhere on the field. It is during the set pieces, scrum and <b>line-out,</b> when the positions are enforced. At line-outs there must be at least two players from each team lined up five metres from where the ball crossed the side line. They form two straight lines next to each other and a player from the team awarded the <b>line-out</b> throws the ball between them. A player from each team stands two metres from the <b>line-out</b> and the opposing team must also have someone standing two metres from the player throwing the ball in. The remainder of the team not participating in the <b>line-out</b> must be positioned at least 10 metres back from the <b>line-out.</b> While anyone on the field can be part of a <b>line-out,</b> it is generally composed of forwards. The usual situation involves the hooker throwing the ball in, aiming for the locks that are lifted into the air by the props. The scrum-halves are usually positioned near the <b>line-out</b> ready to receive the ball once the forwards have gained possession.|$|E

25|$|When {{the ball}} crosses the {{sideline}} during general play a <b>line-out</b> is formed {{with the team}} that did not put the ball into touch throwing it in, unless it was kicked into touch from a penalty kick, {{in which case the}} team kicking to touch throws in. If the ball is kicked directly (does not bounce first) over the sideline by a team member who is outside his 22-metre line, the <b>line-out</b> is formed on the sideline perpendicular to where that player kicked it. The same rule applies if the ball is moved (passed, knocked, kicked or run) back inside the 22 by a player from the same team as the kicker. Once a tackle, scrum, <b>line-out,</b> ruck or maul occurs inside the 22 or the ball is moved there by the opposition a player can kick it directly into touch with the <b>line-out</b> forming where the ball crossed the sideline. If the ball bounces before crossing the sideline or is carried across by a player the <b>line-out</b> is formed where the ball crossed the line. However, a <b>line-out</b> can never take place within five metres of the ingoal area, and is always moved back to a mark five metres out.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} {{exceptions}} to the normal laws regarding line-outs. One is a <b>line-out</b> following a penalty {{and the other is}} the quick throw-in. If a team is awarded a penalty they have the option of kicking the ball into touch for a <b>line-out.</b> They can kick the ball directly into touch from anywhere on the field and the <b>line-out</b> will take place where the ball crossed the line. They also get to throw the ball in at the <b>line-out.</b> A quick throw in occurs when a player throws the ball in before the <b>line-out</b> has had a chance to form. The ball can be thrown in anywhere from where the ball crossed the sideline to the players own goal line. The same ball that went into touch must be used and if the ball has touched another person (not including the person throwing it in, but including other players, replacements, spectators, coaching staff or anyone else not involved in the game) or a <b>line-out</b> has formed (two players from each team) then a quick throw in can not be taken. The ball must travel five metres before it is touches the ground or a player and can only be thrown in straight or backwards.|$|E

25|$|No <b>line-out</b> {{is awarded}} closer than 5 m to {{opponent}} team goal line, if the ball crosses the touch closer the throw-in occurs on 5 m line.|$|E
25|$|The {{forwards}} of {{each team}} (though not necessarily all of them, their number is throwing-in team option) line up a metre apart, {{perpendicular to the}} touchline and between 5 m and 15 m from the touchline. The ball is thrown from the touchline down {{the centre of the}} lines of forwards by a player (usually the hooker) from the team that did not play the ball into touch. The exception to this is when the ball went out from a penalty, in which case the side who gained the penalty throws the ball in. There is an advantage to being the team throwing the ball as that team then knows where along the line the throw is aimed. If the ball passes over the 15 m line, it can be played by everyone and the <b>line-out</b> is over; if the ball is not thrown straight {{down the middle of the}} <b>line-out,</b> the non-infringing team may choose to have the put-in to either a new <b>line-out</b> or a scrum 15 m infield.|$|E
25|$|In round 4, Italy {{achieved}} a second {{victory in the}} same tournament for the first time, when they defeated Wales 23–20 in Rome in a match that ended in controversy. Trailing by three points, Wales {{had the chance to}} equalise in the closing moments of the game when they were awarded a kickable penalty near the Italian 22-metre line. But, having been informed by the referee that 10 seconds remained, they chose to kick for touch, believing that there was time for an attacking <b>line-out</b> and possible try-scoring opportunity, only for the referee to blow his whistle and end the game before the <b>line-out</b> could form. The Welsh players were incensed and the referee later apologised for the misunderstanding that had arisen.|$|E
50|$|Front rowThe {{front row}} {{consists}} of three players: two props (the loosehead prop and the tighthead prop) and the hooker. The role of the two props is to support the hooker during scrums, to provide support for the jumpers during <b>line-outs</b> and to provide strength and power in rucks and mauls. The third position {{in the front row}} is the hooker. The hooker is a key position in attacking and defensive play and is responsible for winning the ball in the scrum. Hookers normally throw the ball in at <b>line-outs.</b>|$|R

25|$|Free kicks {{are awarded}} for {{technical}} infringements {{that do not}} warrant a penalty. This includes indiscretions like players time wasting, charging over the 22-metre line during the oppositions drop-out, pushing in a ruck with their head lower than their hips, returning the ball to a ruck or maul, pretending to clear the ball from a ruck or maul and preventing the ball being thrown in at a quick <b>line-out.</b> Many infringements are penalised by free kicks during line-outs, including delaying or pretending {{to throw the ball}} in (balking), having less than two or more numbers than the opposition, leaving once the <b>line-out</b> has formed, failure to form a <b>line-out,</b> standing closer than five metres or over fifteen metres from the sideline, the receiver or opposition hooker (or equivalent player) standing in the incorrect position, not forming a straight line, not keeping a metre gap between the two lines, lifting a player below the shorts from behind or below the thighs from in front, jumping before the ball is thrown in, not lowering any lifted player, using only the outside arm to catch or deflect the ballor leaving the <b>line-out</b> before the ball is thrown, Free kicks are awarded at scrums are for delay in forming a scrum, incorrect or early binding of the front rows, pushing before the ball is fed, front rows feet off the ground before the ball is fed, the scrumhalf not feeding the ball in correctly or straight, intentionally kicking the ball out of the tunnel, bringing the ball back into the scrum after it has emerged, a non-front row player hooking the ball from the tunnel or the scrum half pretending to clear the ball from the scrum.|$|E
25|$|The IRB trialled 23 {{changes to}} the modern laws in 2006 and some {{competitions}} in Scotland and Australia adopted them in 2007. In 2008, 13 of the variations were trialled globally. Important changes included; no gain in ground if the ball is kicked directly into touch {{after it has been}} moved back into the 22 by a player from the same team as the kicker, the offside lines for backs moved five metres from the scrum, allowing mauls to be legally pulled down and players to enter with their head lower than their hips, no restrictions on the number of players in a <b>line-out,</b> and allowing pregripping and lifting. In 2009 the IRB approved 10 of the laws, rejecting the laws relating to mauls, and numbers in a <b>line-out.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lineouts {{are used}} to restart play when the ball has crossed the sidelines.

Played at the Cardiff Arms Park, the Barbarians won 96.|$|E
25|$|Both sides {{compete for}} the ball, and some players may lift their teammates. (While the laws say that jumping players may only be supported, lifting is uniformly tolerated under {{specified}} conditions). A jumping player cannot be tackled until they stand and only shoulder-to-shoulder contact is allowed; deliberate infringement of this Law is dangerous play, and results in a penalty kick, and frequently {{a trip to the}} sin bin. If a penalty kick is awarded during a <b>line-out</b> and the line out is not over, it is taken 15 m from the touch line.|$|E
25|$|The flanker's role is {{to tackle}} the {{opposition}} and try to steal the ball. The openside flanker binds {{to the side of}} the scrum that covers the greatest area, while the blindside covers the side nearest the side-line. They bind loosely {{to the side of the}} scrum, but still play an important role in keeping the props tight by pushing at an angle. They should be the first forward to a breakdown from a scrum or <b>line-out</b> and are expected to link with the backline or secure the ball at the tackle. Both positions have a high workrate, meaning the players need to be fit, fast and good at reading the opposition's attacking plays. During open play if they have not made the tackle they usually stand in the loose next to the ruck or maul. This allows them to arrive quickly at the next tackle. The blindside is generally the larger of the two and usually acts as a third jumping option at the <b>line-out.</b> The openside flanker is usually faster than the blindside, with good opensides excellent at turning over the ball at the tackle. Teams often use their openside flankers to 'charge' the opposition fly-half, putting pressure on him and forcing him to rush his decision making, kicking or passing. Blindside flankers also have the task of stopping any attempt by the opposition eighth-man to run with the ball around the blindside of a scrum.|$|E
