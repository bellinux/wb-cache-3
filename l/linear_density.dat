Subplasmalemmal <b>linear</b> <b>densities,</b> consisting of {{a thin layer of}} electron-dense material immediately subjacent to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, were found in 30 of the 33 patients, including each of 6 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, 18 of 19 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, 4 of 5 patients with collagen-vascular diseases, 1 patient with pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and 1 patient with marked interstitial pulmonary fibrosis associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Subplasmalemmal <b>linear</b> <b>densities</b> were found in epithelioid cells, macrophages, and giant cells in granulomas in the 6 patients with sarcoidosis and in alveolar macrophages in 4 of these patients. In patients with other fibrotic lung disorders, subplasmalemmal <b>linear</b> <b>densities</b> were limited in distribution to interstitial and alveolar macrophages. In all patients with sarcoidosis some of the subplasmalemmal <b>linear</b> <b>densities</b> of adjacent mononuclear phagocytes, particularly of those in granulomas, were paired and formed specialized intercellular junctions.

40|$|Abstract—Based on the Collins integral, an {{analytical}} {{expression of a}} general Lorentz-Gauss vortex beam propagating in free space is derived, which allows one to calculate the <b>linear</b> momentum <b>density</b> of a general Lorentz-Gauss vortex beam in free space. The <b>linear</b> momentum <b>density</b> distribution of a general Lorentz-Gauss vortex beam propagating in free space is graphically demonstrated. The x-and y-components of the <b>linear</b> momentum <b>density</b> are composed of two lobes with the equivalent area and the opposite sign. Therefore, the overall x- and y-components of the linear momentum in an arbitrary reference plane are equal to zero. The longitudinal component of the <b>linear</b> momentum <b>density</b> {{is proportional to the}} intensity distribution. The influences of the Gaussian waist, the width parameters of the Lorentzian part, the axial propagation distance, and the topological charge on the <b>linear</b> momentum <b>density</b> distribution of a general Lorentz-Gauss vortex beam in free space are examined in detail. 1...|$|R

The Raman and the IR spectra of the raw and dyed fi-bers {{as well as the}} corresponding spectra of pure dyes were analyzed. High quality spectra, both Raman and IR were obtained, requiring no sample preparation. Dyed fibers gave Raman spectra with bands char-acteristic for both the polymer and the dyes, while the IR spectra consist of predominantly bands due to the fiber polymer. Spectral subtraction procedures {{were used to}} separate the Raman spectra of the raw PAN fiber from the corresponding spectrum of dyed fiber and were then compared with the Raman spec-tra of pure dyes. The recorded Raman spectra of the three different <b>linear</b> <b>densities</b> of dyed fibers did not show variation in band frequencies, but in one dyed (blue) fiber, a regular variation in the band intensities was observed. This effect has been related to the quantity of the dye fixed on the (blue) fiber in three dif-ferent <b>linear</b> <b>densities.</b> The results were compared with the quantity of the absorbed dye, previously de-termined for the blue fiber by colorimetric measurements.

40|$|We {{compared}} the thin-section CT findings of 11 intrapulmonary lymph nodes with pathological findings and evaluated {{the possibility of}} CT scan differential diagnosis from pulmonary metastatic nodules. First, we retrospectively reviewed CT scan and pathological findings of intrapulmonary lymph nodes. The median size of these nodules was 6. 2 mm. The nodules appeared round (n= 3) or angular (n= 8) in shape with a sharp border, and they were found {{below the level of}} the carina. The median distance from the nearest pleural surface was 4. 6 mm, and 3 of the 11 nodules were attached to the pleura. On thin-section CT scan, <b>linear</b> <b>densities</b> extending from the intrapulmonary lymph nodes were frequently visualized, and were pathologically proven to be ectatic lymphoid channels. We then {{compared the}} thin-section CT findings of 8 metastatic nodules less than 1 cm in diameter with those of the 11 intrapulmonary lymph nodes. The median size of these nodules was 6. 8 mm, and the median distance from the nearest pleural surface was 16 mm. All nodules appeared round in shape. None of the nodules had <b>linear</b> <b>densities</b> extending from the nodules.
