60|$|Arrived at {{the little}} {{thatched}} <b>lookout</b> <b>house,</b> we rested our elbows on the railing in front and looked abroad over the wide crater and down over the sheer precipice at the seething fires beneath us. The view was a startling improvement on my daylight experience. I turned to see {{the effect on the}} balance of the company and found the reddest-faced set of men I almost ever saw. In the strong light every countenance glowed like red-hot iron, every shoulder was suffused with crimson and shaded rearward into dingy, shapeless obscurity! The place below looked like the infernal regions and these men like half-cooled devils just come up on a furlough.|$|E

The watershed {{formed by the}} mountain range exhibits a moderate Mediterranean climate with marked variations between the seasons. The winters are wet and cold with temperature {{in the range of}} 36 - 55 F. The summers are dry and hot with temperature varying from 75 - 95 F. The annual precipitation reported is about 54 in. During winter the snow precipitation on the mountains is heavy with several feet of snow. A new steel lookout tower of 60 ft height replacing a wooden tower, was built on the Banner Mountain in 1926. A <b>lookout</b> <b>house</b> was added in 1931. Both structures have undergone several improvements over the years. in 1971, California's first [...] "Women's Liberation" [...] fire lookout crew was created here as fire watching crew of the U.S. Forest Service.

50|$|In the Prose Edda, Kvasir {{appears in}} the books Gylfaginning and Skáldskaparmál. Kvasir is {{mentioned}} a single time in Gylfaginning; in chapter 50, where the enthroned figure of High tells Gangleri (Gylfi in disguise) of how Loki was caught by the gods after being responsible {{for the murder of}} the god Baldr. In the chapter, High says that while Loki was hiding from the gods, he often took the form of a salmon during the day and swam in the waterfall Franangrsfors. Loki considered what sort of device that the gods might craft to catch him there, and so, sitting in his four-door mountain <b>lookout</b> <b>house,</b> knotted together linen thread in “which ever since the net has been”. Loki noticed that the gods were not far away from him, and that Odin had spotted him from Hliðskjálf. Loki sat before a fire, and when he noticed the gods were coming near him, he threw the net into the fire and jumped up and slipped into the river. The gods reached Loki’s house, and the first to enter was Kvasir, who High describes as “the wisest of all”. Kvasir saw the shape of the net in the ash of the fire, and so realized its purpose; to catch fish. And so Kvasir told the gods about it. The gods used the shape found in the ash as their model, and with it flushed Loki out of the river, resulting in his binding.|$|E

5000|$|In November 1861, Edisto Island was evacuated. During the Civil War, both Union and Confederate forces {{used the}} cupola atop the Bleak Hall {{plantation}} <b>house</b> as a <b>lookout.</b> This <b>house</b> burned down during or {{shortly after the}} war, and a new one was built in a mix of Victorian styles. [...] The war had disrupted property records, and Townsend was only able to establish his ownership of the combined plantations through an appeal to U.S. president Andrew Johnson.|$|R

50|$|The tower {{has five}} {{casement}} windows: two opposite the door, one above the other, another {{above the door}} and two more higher up facing north and south. The tiny windows that currently provide illumination for the top floor under the observation cabin are a unique aspect.

The timber double entrance door {{at the base of}} the tower has a stone drip mould over it, as do the casements.|$|R
5000|$|During the Edo {{period in}} Japan fire <b>lookout</b> towers (Hinomi-yagura) <b>housed</b> the fire {{fighting}} team of town (Machi-bi-keshi). Usually the fire lookout tower was built near a [...] fire station (Ban-ya), and was equipped with a ladder, lookout platform, and an alarm bell (Hanshō).From these towers watchmen could observe the entire town, and {{in the event of}} a fire they would ring the alarm bell, calling up firemen and warning town residents. In some towns the bells were also used to mark the time.|$|R

5000|$|The Bristol Channel {{has always}} been a {{hazardous}} stretch of water because of the extreme tidal range. There are very strong currents or rips close inshore, with speeds that exceed 7 knots (13 km/h), for several hours at each tide. The {{rise and fall of the}} tides at Penarth are the second highest recorded anywhere in the world [...] The original 1861 oar-powered lifeboat was housed in a shed built near to where Penarth Yacht Club now stands at the southern end of Penarth beach and controlled by staff located at the Coastguard cottages and Trinity <b>House</b> <b>lookout</b> tower on Tower Hill near Marine Parade.|$|R
50|$|Cabramurra was {{established}} in 1954 using prefabricated houses, {{as part of the}} Snowy Mountains Scheme and associated Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme. An earlier surveying camp had been established there in 1951. The town was moved some 500m and 20m vertically to a more sheltered position, its current site, in 1974, leaving the original site as the <b>lookout.</b> The original <b>houses</b> were either demolished or relocated to Talbingo, Adaminaby and Jindabyne. The new houses were built with Besser blocks to a design specifically tailored to the environment. Long steep roofs allow snow to slide off, and the interiors are designed around a central heater (originally fuelled by oil) which warms all rooms in the house either directly or indirectly (chimney passes between upstairs bedrooms). All power and phone lines are routed underground.|$|R
5000|$|A fire lookout tower, {{fire tower}} or <b>lookout</b> tower, {{provides}} <b>housing</b> and protection {{for a person}} known as a [...] "fire lookout" [...] whose duty it is to search for wildfires in the wilderness. The fire lookout tower is a small building, usually located on the summit of a mountain or other high vantage point, {{in order to maximize}} the viewing distance and range, known as view shed. From this vantage point the fire lookout can see smoke that may develop, determine the location by using a device known as an Osborne Fire Finder, and call fire suppression personnel to the fire. Lookouts also report weather changes and plot the location of lightning strikes during storms. The location of the strike is monitored for a period of days after in case of ignition.|$|R
60|$|What {{was still}} worse, the Lambs gave a grand ball, {{to which they}} {{neglected}} to invite any of their old neighbors; {{but they had a}} great deal of genteel company from Theobald's Road, Red-Lion Square, and other parts towards the west. There were several beaux of their brother's acquaintance from Gray's Inn Lane and Hatton Garden; and not less than three Aldermen's ladies with their daughters. This was not to be forgotten or forgiven. All Little Britain was in an uproar with the smacking of whips, the lashing of miserable horses, and the rattling and the jingling of hackney coaches. The gossips of the neighborhood might be seen popping their nightcaps out at every window, watching the crazy vehicles rumble by; and there was a knot of virulent old cronies, that kept a <b>lookout</b> from a <b>house</b> just opposite the retired butcher's, and scanned and criticised every one that knocked at the door.|$|R
5000|$|From Little Kevin, the {{conversation}} between {{the police and}} Randy soon leaks out to the streets and Marlo's crew. Although the penalty for informing to police is usually death, Marlo declines to order a hit {{on the grounds that}} Randy poses no further threat to him. Instead, he instructs Chris and Snoop to spread the word that Randy has been speaking to the police and he is labeled as a snitch in the streets. Randy is walking with Michael and Duquan when he is confronted at school by a group of students who want to fight him for being a snitch. Although Michael protects Randy and fights the kids off, Randy is beaten badly. Word soon gets back to Carver that Randy is in trouble around school and in his neighborhood and puts a police car on <b>lookout</b> at Randy's <b>house</b> promising Randy that he's {{going to take care of}} everything. People looking to hurt Randy notice the car and make a false police call from a nearby telephone booth to get them to leave the scene. With the cops gone, molotov cocktails are thrown into the house - burning it down, hospitalizing Miss Anna, and leaving Randy without a guardian.|$|R
