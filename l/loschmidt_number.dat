5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{quantization}} of radiation {{was discovered in}} 1900 by Max Planck, who {{had been trying to}} understand the emission of radiation from heated objects, known as black-body radiation. By assuming that energy can only be absorbed or released in tiny, differential, discrete packets he called [...] "bundles" [...] or [...] "energy elements", Planck accounted for certain objects changing colour when heated. On December 14, 1900, Planck reported his findings to the German Physical Society, and introduced the idea of quantization {{for the first time as}} a part of his research on black-body radiation. As a result of his experiments, Planck deduced the numerical value of h, known as the Planck constant, and could also report a more precise value for the Avogadro - <b>Loschmidt</b> <b>number,</b> the number of real molecules in a mole and the unit of electrical charge, to the German Physical Society. After his theory was validated, Planck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery in 1918.|$|E
40|$|J. J. Loschmidt was an Austrian chemist {{who died}} {{more than one}} hundred years ago. A few older chemists may have used {{textbooks}} that refer to the <b>Loschmidt</b> <b>number</b> rather than the Avogadro number; this is because he {{was the first person to}} provide a reasonable estimate of what would now be called the Avogadro number. He was also amongst the first scientists to unravel the structure of Benzene; a few historians of science consider that he should have precedence over Kekule in this matter. He was born into a very poor family, became a manufacturer of chemicals, but was unsuccessful as an industrialist. He became a school teacher and eventually obtained a post at the university of Vienna as a lecturer. He was intensely modest and it will be argued that his personal modesty may explain why he is not better known today...|$|E
40|$|<b>Loschmidt's</b> <b>number</b> {{has played}} an {{important}} role in the development of science and technology and in the establishment of various standards. However, despite advances in the technological methods of estimating <b>Loschmidt's</b> <b>number,</b> the nature of its formation remains unknown. The information that lies in the nature of this constant can be useful for understanding the properties of a physical vacuum and character of processes of the interaction of matter in this environment. Basing on time and experiment tested the laws of molecular physics and thermodynamics, some features of the host medium of micro-particles involved in the formation of <b>Loschmidt’s</b> <b>number</b> were identified, describing its nature and the previously unknown phenomena of fundamental pressure of a Universe. The characteristics of various physical and chemical processes occurring in systems associated with a vacuum and the behavior of heavenly bodies are considered from the perspective of thisphenomenon’sexistence...|$|R
50|$|It is {{reproducibility}} in repeated {{observations that}} identifies dynamical structure in a system. E.T. Jaynes explains how this reproducibility is why entropy {{is so important}} in this topic: entropy {{is a measure of}} experimental reproducibility. The entropy tells how many times one would have to repeat the experiment in order to expect to see a departure from the usual reproducible result. When the process goes on in a system with less than a 'practically infinite' number (much much less than Avogadro's or <b>Loschmidt's</b> <b>numbers)</b> of molecules, the thermodynamic reproducibility fades, and fluctuations become easier to see.|$|R

5000|$|The Loschmidt {{constant}} or <b>Loschmidt's</b> <b>number</b> (symbol: n0) is {{the number}} of particles (atoms or molecules) of an ideal gas in a given volume (the number density). It is usually quoted at standard temperature and pressure, the 2010 CODATA recommended value [...] is 2.686 7805(24) per cubic metre at 0 °C and 1 atm and the 2006 CODATA recommended value [...] was 2.686 7774(47) per cubic metre at 0 °C and 1 atm. It is named after the Austrian physicist Johann Josef Loschmidt, who was the first to estimate the physical size of molecules in 1865. The term [...] "Loschmidt constant" [...] is also sometimes used to refer to the Avogadro constant, particularly in German texts.|$|R
