40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} large scale stress {{analysis of a}} wellbore with perforations. Both vertical and horizontal wellbores with perforations at different orientations were considered. The change of stresses in the unfractured perforations induced by a propped fracture is also examined. The computations were carried out using boundary element analysis with the fracturing code FRANC 3 D. The results are discussed {{in relation to the}} problem of perforation failure, and possible risk of sand production, due to high compressive stresses. The results show that in a vertical wellbore all perforations, independent of orientation, suffer locally in the <b>lateral</b> <b>faces</b> by high compressive stresses, primarily caused by the vertical in-situ stress. In addition, the perforations parallel to the minimum far-field stress suffer from high compressive stresses all-around them. The highest compressive stresses were encountered in the <b>lateral</b> <b>faces</b> of horizontal perforations of a horizontal wellbore. In this case the calculated stresses were more than double the stresses of a corresponding vertical wellbore. In both vertical and horizontal wellbores, high stress concentration was observed near the base of perforations. The near-wellbore area of stress concentration is approximately equal with one wellbore radius. A propped fracture results in increase of the compressive stress around the perforations. The stress increase is higher in the perforations closer to the fracture and increases with propped width. The increase of compressive stress is much higher at the top/lower faces of perforations which is already less than the existing compressive stress at the <b>lateral</b> <b>faces</b> of the perforations. Nevertheless, the compressive stress in the <b>lateral</b> <b>faces</b> may increase by more than 30 % leading to an extra risk of perforation failure and sand production...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn a {{previous}} work, {{the first author}} has identified three-dimensional boundary conditions “of von Kármán's type” that lead, through a formal asymptotic analysis of the three-dimensional solution, to the classical von Kármán equations, when they are applied to the entire <b>lateral</b> <b>face</b> of a nonlinearly elastic plate. In this paper, we consider the more general situation where {{only a portion of}} the <b>lateral</b> <b>face</b> is subjected to boundary conditions of von Kármán's type, while the remaining portion is subjected to boundary conditions of free edge. We then show that the asymptotic analysis of the three-dimensional solution still leads in this case to a two-dimensional boundary value problem that is analogous to, but is more general than, the von Kármán equations. In particular, it is remarkable that the boundary conditions for the Airy function can still be determined solely from the data...|$|R

HCP are composed of a CFRP sheet that is glued to the external surface of a thin plate made of strain hardening cementitious composite (SHCC). These panels were glued to the <b>lateral</b> <b>faces</b> of RC deep beams. Three groups of shear strengthened RC beams were tested under three-point bending load configuration. CFRP sheet, SHCC plate or HCP were individually applied to the <b>lateral</b> <b>faces</b> of shear deficiently reinforced beams to compare {{the effectiveness of these}} different strengthening schemes. The load-mid span deflections of these beams are compared to the response of the control beam. The maximum load carrying capacity and its corresponding mid-span deflection, crack pattern and the initial flexural stiffness are the studied parameters.
