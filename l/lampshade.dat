25|$|His Prairie houses use themed, coordinated design {{elements}} (often {{based on}} plant forms) that are repeated in windows, carpets and other fittings. He made innovative {{use of new}} building materials such as precast concrete blocks, glass bricks and zinc cames (instead of the traditional lead) for his leadlight windows, and he famously used Pyrex glass tubing as a major element in the Johnson Wax Headquarters. Wright {{was also one of}} the first architects to design and install custom-made electric light fittings, including some of the very first electric floor lamps, and his very early use of the then-novel spherical glass <b>lampshade</b> (a design previously not possible due to the physical restrictions of gas lighting).|$|E
500|$|Initially unenthusiastic {{about his}} task of {{realising}} Alan Fennell's script, director David Elliott developed his inspiration {{after seeing the}} 1965 spy thriller film The Ipcress File, starring Michael Caine. He remembers that the film [...] "used all the old-fashioned shotslooking through a <b>lampshade,</b> etc. On Monday morning, Paddy [...] came in and said, 'I saw a film this weekend,' and I said, 'So did I.' 'Was it The Ipcress File?' 'Yep. Right, that's what I want to do.'" [...] In homage to The Ipcress File, Elliott decided to incorporate [...] "quirky visuals" [...] into his direction of the Thunderbirds episode.|$|E
500|$|The police entered around 7:54am with a {{sledgehammer}} {{through the back}} door. The door had been locked from the inside, with the key still in the lock. They found five bodies with multiple gunshot wounds, Nevill downstairs {{in the kitchen and}} the rest upstairs. Twenty-five shots had been fired, mostly at close range. In what order the family was killed is not known. A telephone was lying on one of the kitchen surfaces with its receiver off the hook, next to several [...]22 shells. The police said chairs and stools were overturned, and there was broken crockery, a broken sugar basin, and what looked like blood on the floor. A ceiling light <b>lampshade</b> had been broken.|$|E
5000|$|By 1956, <b>lampshades</b> and pillboxes {{were said}} to be {{overtaking}} the previously popular mushroom and cartwheel designs at Ascot races. A reviewer of the opening day's fashions noted: [...] "1956 must be dismissed as an unspectacular year. Gone were the cartwheels and giant mushrooms of other years, and in their place were pill-boxes (Princess Margaret), <b>lampshades</b> (Princess Alexandra) and various derivations of the beret".|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Lampshades,</b> her cult comedy lounge {{act with}} veteran improviser Scot Robinson, {{has been running}} in Hollywood and in comedy festivals {{all over the country}} since 2001 and was seen at the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, Colorado.

An indoor plant is visible behind the <b>lampshades.</b> Chairs {{can be seen in}} the right background, while pillars can be seen throughout the room...|$|R
500|$|The statue also sparked an {{interior}} decorating fad in the 1920s. The design {{was so popular}} that Viquesney manufactured replica pot metal statuettes by the thousands. Also available were doughboy lamps, which were made from the 12" [...] statuettes (the doughboy held a light bulb and <b>lampshade</b> in his raised hand), candlesticks, plaques, a smaller 6" [...] version of the statuette, as well as less expensive plaster versions. The statuettes and lamps were made from 1921 to 1925 in Americus, Georgia, and continued to be produced in Spencer, Indiana until at least the late 1930s. With {{the passage of time}} and changes in fashion, many of these items were lost, broken, or discarded, making those few remaining in good condition sought after by modern collectors.|$|E
500|$|On June 15, 1977, the Rangers {{purchased}} Ellis {{from the}} Oakland Athletics. Ellis had a resurgent {{second half of}} the 1977 season, going 10–6 with a 2.90 ERA. Ellis complained about manager Billy Hunter's liquor policy in 1978. Hunter, responding to a raucous team flight, banned liquor on team flights; Ellis vowed that he would bring liquor on the plane to Toronto anyway. Ellis led a player insurrection against manager Billy Hunter's authoritarian style, declaring that Hunter [...] "may be Hitler, but he ain't making no <b>lampshade</b> out of me." [...] The Rangers organization blamed Ellis for the team's disappointing finish in 1978 and indicated that they would look to trade Ellis. However, owner Brad Corbett sided with Ellis over Hunter, firing Hunter after the season.|$|E
500|$|Although {{he never}} {{formally}} studied music, Caymmi taught himself to play guitar {{in the late}} 1920s and began to compose, sing, and play his own songs on Bahian radio programs around 1930. He first achieved widespread recognition in 1933, when at age 16, he composed the song [...] "O Que É Que a Baiana Tem?" [...] ("What Is It About Bahian Women?") for singer Carmen Miranda. In 1936, at age 22, he won a songwriting contest at Salvador's annual Carnaval celebration. His prize was a pink satin <b>lampshade.</b> Despite his early musical success, he moved to Rio de Janeiro in 1938 with intentions to pursue a law degree and to return to working as a journalist. While employed there by the newspaper Diários Associados, he spent his spare time composing and singing songs on the radio show Dragão da Rua Larga. His popularity began to grow with the show's audience.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lampshades</b> {{are made}} of fabric, parchment, glass, Tiffany glass, or plastic. Common fabric {{materials}} include silk, linen, cotton, or even paper. Fabric shades are reinforced by metal frames to give the <b>lampshades</b> their shape, while paper shades can hold their shape without support. For this reason, paper shades can be more fragile than fabric shades. Darker shades sometimes add a reflective liner such as gold or silver {{in order to maximize}} light output.|$|R
5000|$|... "Cups" [...] is {{a version}} of the 1931 Carter Family song [...] "When I'm Gone", usually {{performed}} a cappella with a cup used to provide percussion, as in the cup game. It was first performed this way in a YouTube video by Lulu and The <b>Lampshades</b> in 2009 (under the title [...] "You're Gonna Miss Me"). Composition of the song is credited to A. P. Carter and Luisa Gerstein of Lulu and the <b>Lampshades.</b>|$|R
500|$|Upon {{being made}} a pariah, Brian is banned from every bar and {{convenience}} store in Quahog, {{making it impossible}} for him to drink. Desperate, and suffering from delirium tremens (he hallucinates seeing several alcoholic beverages begging him to drink them), Brian fakes his repentance and convinces Meg to cease all hostilities against him so he can get back to drinking, but she takes him to burn books that are [...] "harmful to God" [...] (including On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, and a book titled Logic for First Graders). A disgusted Brian admits his bluff and attempts to convince Meg that what she is doing is wrong. When Meg refuses to listen, Brian points out to her that if there were truly a loving God, then he would not have created Meg to have an attractive mother like Lois but have her be unattractive like Peter, and that she would not be living with a family that holds her in contempt and otherwise pretends that she does not exist (along with not even caring enough about her to get her a mumps shot). Feeling ashamed, Meg concedes to Brian's argument and apologizes for her behavior, confessing that she does not know how she can feel loved. Brian then assures her that the answers are inside herself, and the real meaning of their existence is out there somewhere. Afterward, it is revealed that the entire Family Guy universe takes place within the molecules of a <b>lampshade</b> in the shared bedroom of Adam West and Rob Lowe.|$|E

She becomes uneasy after seeing a {{homemade}} fleshy <b>lampshade</b> and a half-cranium-shaped bowl. She excuses herself to find his [...] "hobby" [...] room down the hall, where he drops her through a trap door after she asks about the various tools and drying skin. She later wakes to find herself chained to the floor near Wendy's (Clea Duvall) frozen corpse. Thredson, dressed in Bloody Face's clothes, asks her to kiss Wendy, saying she will not bite as he has removed her teeth {{to put them in}} his flesh-made mask, which he then puts on.|$|E
2500|$|Denning {{was born}} Robert Dennis Besser in New York City, New York, to Jean (née Rosen) and Jacob Besser. Denning, {{as he was}} often called, {{developed}} an early interest in his body and health, a characteristic instilled in him by his mother. He was just fifteen when he met Edgar de Evia who was the research assistant to Dr. Guy Beckley Stearns and {{would go on to}} become a noted photographer. He became a testing subject for this Homeopathic medical research and when his parents and younger brother moved to Florida, he stayed in New York City living with de Evia and his mother Miirrha Alhambra. He would often say that he saw his first <b>lampshade</b> in this home, as he grew up with a bare bulb being adequate. His first effort with decorating was perhaps in imitation of Syrie Maugham when Edgar and he, painted everything in Miirrha's room white and put her bed on a dais. Her only response was: [...] "Did you have to paint even my Baccarat perfume bottles?" [...] He never used white again.|$|E

2500|$|The {{post at the}} ICA also afforded Hamilton {{the time}} to further his {{research}} on Duchamp, {{which resulted in the}} 1960 publication of a typographic version of Duchamp's Green Box, which comprised Duchamp's original notes for the design and construction of his famous work The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, also known as The Large Glass. Hamilton's 1955 exhibition of paintings at the Hanover Gallery were all in some form a homage to Duchamp. In the same year Hamilton organized the exhibition Man Machine Motion at the Hatton Gallery in Newcastle. Designed to look more like an advertising display than a conventional art exhibition the show prefigured Hamilton's contribution to the This Is Tomorrow exhibition in London, at the Whitechapel Gallery the following year. Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing? was created in 1956 for the catalogue of This Is Tomorrow, where it was reproduced in black and white and also used in posters for the exhibit. The collage depicts a muscle-man provocatively holding a Tootsie Pop and a woman with large, bare breasts wearing a <b>lampshade</b> hat, surrounded by emblems of 1950s affluence from a vacuum cleaner to a large canned ham. Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing? is widely acknowledged {{as one of the first}} pieces of Pop Art. Hamilton's written definition of what [...] "pop" [...] is laid the ground for the whole international movement. Hamilton's definition of Pop Art from a letter to Alison and Peter Smithson dated 16 January 1957 was: [...] "Pop Art is: popular, transient, expendable, low-cost, mass-produced, young, witty, sexy, gimmicky, glamorous, and Big Business", stressing its everyday, commonplace values. He thus created collages incorporating advertisements from mass-circulation newspapers and magazines.|$|E

60|$|That night Hapley {{found the}} moth {{crawling}} over his counterpane. He {{sat on the}} edge of the bed in his shirt sleeves and reasoned with himself. Was it pure hallucination? He knew he was slipping, and he battled for his sanity with the same silent energy he had formerly displayed against Pawkins. So persistent is mental habit, that he felt as if it were still a struggle with Pawkins. He was well versed in psychology. He knew that such visual illusions do come as a result of mental strain. But the point was, he did not only see the moth, he had heard it when it touched the edge of the <b>lampshade,</b> and afterwards when it hit against the wall, and he had felt it strike his face in the dark.|$|E
