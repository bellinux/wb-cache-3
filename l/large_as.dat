5|$|Asteroids in the {{asteroid}} belt are divided into asteroid groups and families based on their orbital characteristics. Asteroid moons are asteroids that orbit larger asteroids.

However, a high ratio does not of itself demonstrate intelligence: very small animals have high ratios and the treeshrew has the largest quotient of any mammal.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{behavior}} of Internet traffic on the ASlevel topology and discuss its implications on interdomain traffic engineering. We rely on two notable interdomain traffic traces, the first is one month long {{and the other is}} one day long. This study shows that interdomain paths are stable for a large majority of the traffic from a routing viewpoint. We show that the aggregation of the traffic occurring on the AS-level graph is essentially limited to direct peers, with almost no aggregation occurring at <b>larger</b> <b>AS</b> hop distances. Furthermore, only part of the AS paths of the AS-level topology that see a lot of traffic are stable, when considering their presence among the <b>largest</b> <b>AS</b> paths on a hourly basis. Relying on the <b>largest</b> <b>AS</b> paths in traffic over a time window to capture the traffic over the next time interval discloses the important variability of the traffic seen by the <b>largest</b> <b>AS</b> paths in traffic. Interdomain traffic engineering is hence due to be difficult because of the limited traffic aggregation on the AS-level topology and the important topological variability of the traffic for a significant percentage of the total traffic...|$|R
