Cover released at top by pulling lever as described in "Lever-Arm Pin Puller" (NPO- 18788). Removal of cover begins when technician or robot pulls upper-pin-release <b>lever.</b> <b>Cover</b> swings downward until tabs on lower pins are pulled through slots in their receptacles. Lower pins are then free...|$|E

5000|$|Levers {{evolved over}} time from being all {{aluminum}} with non-drilled lever arms to using resin bodies and drilled lever arms in some later models. Two varieties of hoods were supplied: half-hoods covering {{only the top}} of the lever assembly, or full-hoods covering the entire body of the lever assembly. Both included the built-in adjusters that allowed riders to adjust brake clearance while riding. MAFAC also supplied rubber <b>lever</b> arm <b>covers</b> as an option.|$|R
6000|$|No {{object that}} was at all {{extraordinary}} appeared {{in any part of}} it. The Sub-prefect looked round the place, commanded everybody to be silent, stamped twice on the floor, called for a candle, looked attentively at the spot he had stamped on, and ordered the flooring there to be carefully taken up. This was done in no time. Lights were produced, and we saw a deep raftered cavity between the floor of this room and the ceiling of the room beneath. Through this cavity there ran perpendicularly a sort of case of iron thickly greased; and inside the case appeared the screw, which communicated with the bed-top below. Extra lengths of screw, freshly oiled; <b>levers</b> <b>covered</b> with felt; all the complete upper works of a heavy press--constructed with infernal ingenuity so as to join the fixtures below, and when taken to pieces again, to go into the smallest possible compass--were next discovered and pulled out on the floor. After some little difficulty the Sub-prefect succeeded in putting the machinery together, and, leaving his men to work it, descended with me to the bedroom. The smothering canopy was then lowered, but not so noiselessly as I had seen it lowered. When I mentioned this to the Sub-prefect, his answer, simple as it was, had a terrible significance. [...] "My men," [...] said he, [...] "are working down the bed-top for the first time--the men whose money you won were in better practice." ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{geotechnical}} {{consolidation test}} {{is used to}} detect the soil deformation under all levels of vertical load. Consolidation parameters {{play a vital role}} in the basal design of the buildings. But the <b>lever</b> consolidometer <b>covers</b> too large area, and needs high labor intensity. The pressure consolidometer is not convenient to find leak, noisy, and is affected by the power supply. We developed the hydraulic consolidation system, which is aid to make consolidation tests of the soil samples. The hydraulic consolidation system is composed of the hydraulic pump used as a pressure source, the hydraulic piston cylinder used as the load transfer device, intelligent instrument and solenoid valve. Through the comparison of the test by three methods, it proved that the test results are identical. The coefficient of variation of the parameters is less than 0. 1, while its efficiency is 31. 33 times higher than the lever test, 6. 86 times higher than the pressure method...|$|R
40|$|Abstract − This paper {{describes}} the unique features and metrological {{performance of a}} new 55 kN / 2200 kN lever deadweight force standard machine set up recently at SPRING Singapore. It uses a novel 55 kN deadweight stack with individual mass disk drives, a single lever of 40 times multiplication ratio and a 2, 2 MN tension-compression loading device. The machine is of increased capacity, with a wider force range and larger amplification ratio than previously possible. The <b>lever</b> machine <b>covers</b> force range from 10 kN up to 2200 kN in intervals of 10 kN. For the first time, a force standard machine of this type and size uses an entirely digital control system. The machine {{has been the subject}} of a comparison measurement with the PTB, preliminary results of which are given. The uncertainties of the machine were found to be within 2 ⋅ 10 - 5 for the deadweight part and 1 ⋅ 10 - 4 for the lever part. The system now serves as a primary force standard fo...|$|R
50|$|The {{case was}} of the variety known as giraffe. The space under the {{keyboard}} was enclosed, a knee-hold being left in which were two pedals used to set in rotation a large wooden cylinder fixed just behind the keyboard over the <b>levers,</b> and <b>covered</b> with a roll-top {{similar to those of}} modern office desks. The cylinder (in some specimens covered with chamois leather) tapered towards the treble-end. When a key was depressed, a little tongue of wood, one end of which stopped the string, was pressed against the revolving cylinder, and the vibrations produced by friction were transmitted to the string and reinforced as in the piano and violin by the soundboard. The adjustment of the parts and the velocity of the cylinder required delicacy and great nicety, for if the little wooden tongues rested too lightly upon the cylinder or the strings, harmonics were produced, and the note jumped to the octave or twelfth.Sometimes when chords were played the touch became so heavy that two performers were required, as in the early medieval organistrum, the prototype of the harmonichord. Carl Maria von Weber must have had some opinion of the possibilities of the harmonichord, which in tone resembled the glass harmonica, since he composed a concerto with orchestral accompaniment for the instrument.|$|R
