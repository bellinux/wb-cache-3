[...] A <b>load</b> <b>cell</b> was added to directly measure the thrust of the missile. [...] A cutoff system was added to detect rough combustion in the engine and automatically stop tests. [...] This system prevented engine damage while engineers solved the problem. [...] The first Redstone built by Chrysler was tested at the Interim Stand. [...] Chrysler built thirty-eight developmental Redstone missiles and all sixty-three tactical Redstones in Detroit. [...] In addition, several of the Redstone missiles were modified to aid the Jupiter missile development program. [...] These longer missiles were called Jupiter-C and test fired on the Interim Stand after it was enlarged and strengthened. [...] A series of tests using propellants chilled to [...] established that the Redstone could be deployed in the Arctic.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{documents}} the derivation {{of the data}} reduction equations for the calibration of the six-component thrust stand located in the CE- 22 Advanced Nozzle Test Facility. The purpose of the calibration {{is to determine the}} first-order interactions between the axial, lateral, and vertical <b>load</b> <b>cells</b> (second-order interactions are assumed to be negligible). In an ideal system, the measurements made by the thrust stand along the three coordinate axes should be independent. For example, when a test article applies an axial force on the thrust stand, the axial <b>load</b> <b>cells</b> should measure the full magnitude of the force, while the off-axis <b>load</b> <b>cells</b> (lateral and vertical) should read zero. Likewise, if a lateral force is applied, the lateral <b>load</b> <b>cells</b> should measure the entire force, while the axial and vertical <b>load</b> <b>cells</b> should read zero. However, in real-world systems, there may be interactions between the <b>load</b> <b>cells.</b> Through proper design of the thrust stand, these interactions can be minimized, but are hard to eliminate entirely. Therefore, the purpose of the thrust stand calibration is to account for these interactions, so that necessary corrections can be made during testing. These corrections can be expressed {{in the form of an}} interaction matrix, and this paper shows the derivation of the equations used to obtain the coefficients in this matrix...|$|R

An oscillating data pattern can {{be the result of}} ringing. Ringing can be suppressed in a limited fashion by passive means.
