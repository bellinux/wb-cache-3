The luggage is filled with the life experience, the personality and in this case the needs that the child has. The needs could be anything from nearness to physical and psychological disorders that requires more pedagogical attention. We have in this study looked closer into how children in need of certain support are allowed to influence the everyday work in the preschool. We have observed two different preschools within the same school district, interviewed teachers and handed out questionnaires to parents and legal guardians. The object has been to study if children with disabilities and children without disabilities, gets the same opportunity to influence and to participate in the everyday work in the preschool. Our question formulation in this study is; How does children with special needs get the opportunity to influence the everyday work within the preschool?   By comparing these preschools we have been able to draw the conclusion that differences exist regarding how the children gets to influence the everyday work in the preschool.
