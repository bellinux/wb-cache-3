Amongst other prospective operations, Skylon would be capable of transporting payloads of up to 10-tonnes to the International Space Station. REL has also completed internal studies into the use of Skylon as a launch platform for a network of space-based solar power satellites, which have been historically unfeasible due to high <b>launch</b> <b>costs.</b> According to business publication Management Today, Skylon has been discussed as a possible replacement for NASA's Space Shuttle programme.|$|E

40|$|Life {{support system}} designs for long-duration space {{missions}} have {{a multitude of}} requirements drivers, such as mission objectives, political considerations, cost, crew wellness, inherent mission attributes, {{as well as many}} other influences. Evaluation of requirements satisfaction can be difficult, particularly at an early stage of mission design. Because <b>launch</b> <b>cost</b> is a critical factor and relatively easy to quantify, it is a point of focus in early mission design. The method used to determine <b>launch</b> <b>cost</b> influences the accuracy of the estimate. This paper discusses the appropriateness of dynamic mission simulation in estimating the <b>launch</b> <b>cost</b> of a life support system. This paper also provides an abbreviated example of a dynamic simulation life support model and possible ways in which such a model might be utilized for design improvement. c 2004 COSPAR.

25|$|Gerard O'Neill, {{noting the}} problem of high <b>launch</b> <b>costs</b> in the early 1970s, {{proposed}} building the SPS's in orbit with materials from the Moon. <b>Launch</b> <b>costs</b> from the Moon are potentially much lower than from Earth, due to the lower gravity and lack of atmospheric drag. This 1970s proposal assumed the then-advertised future launch costing of NASA's space shuttle. This approach would require substantial up front capital investment to establish mass drivers on the Moon. Nevertheless, on 30 April 1979, the Final Report ("Lunar Resources Utilization for Space Construction") by General Dynamics' Convair Division, under NASA contract NAS9-15560, concluded that use of lunar resources would be cheaper than Earth-based materials for a system of as few as thirty Solar Power Satellites of 10GW capacity each.|$|E
40|$|The {{decision}} {{to develop a}} particular life support technology or to select it for flight usually depends on the cost to develop and fly it. Other criteria - performance, safety, reliability, crew time, and risk - are considered, but cost is always an important factor. Because <b>launch</b> <b>cost</b> accounts {{for most of the}} cost of planetary missions, and because <b>launch</b> <b>cost</b> is directly proportional to the mass launched, equivalent mass has been used instead of cost to select life support technology. The equivalent mass of a life support system includes the estimated masses of the hardware and of the pressurized volume, power supply, and cooling system that the hardware requires. The equivalent mass is defined as the total payload launch mass needed to provide and support the system. An extension of equivalent mass, Equivalent System Mass (ESM), has been established for use in Advanced Life Support. A crew time mass-equivalent and sometimes other non-mass factors are added to equivalent mass to create ESM. Equivalent mass is an estimate of the <b>launch</b> <b>cost</b> only. For earth orbit rather than planetary missions, the <b>launch</b> <b>cost</b> is usually exceeded by the cost of Design, Development, Test, and Evaluation (DDT&E). Equivalent mass is used only in life support analysis. Life Cycle Cost (LCC) is much more commonly used. LCC includes DDT&E, <b>launch,</b> and operations <b>costs.</b> Since LCC includes <b>launch</b> <b>cost,</b> it is always a more accurate cost estimator than equivalent mass. The relative <b>costs</b> of development, <b>launch,</b> and operations vary depending on the mission design, destination, and duration. Since DDT&E or operations may <b>cost</b> more than <b>launch,</b> LCC may give a more accurate cost ranking than equivalent mass. To be sure of identifying the lowest cost technology for a particular mission, we should use LCC rather than equivalent mass...|$|R

25|$|To give {{an idea of}} {{the scale}} of the problem, {{assuming}} a solar panel mass of 20kg per kilowatt (without considering the mass of the supporting structure, antenna, or any significant mass reduction of any focusing mirrors) a 4 GW power station would weigh about 80,000 metric tons, all of which would, in current circumstances, be launched from the Earth. Very lightweight designs could likely achieve 1kg/kW, meaning 4,000 metric tons for the solar panels for the same 4 GW capacity station. This would be the equivalent of between 40 and 150 heavy-lift launch vehicle (HLLV) launches to send the material to low earth orbit, where it would likely be converted into subassembly solar arrays, which then could use high-efficiency ion-engine style rockets to (slowly) reach GEO (Geostationary orbit). With an estimated serial launch cost for shuttle-based HLLVs of $500 million to $800 million, and <b>launch</b> <b>costs</b> for alternative HLLVs at $78 million, total <b>launch</b> <b>costs</b> would range between $11 billion (low cost HLLV, low weight panels) and $320 billion ('expensive' HLLV, heavier panels). To these costs must be added the environmental impact of heavy space launch emissions, if such costs are to be used in comparison to earth-based energy production. For comparison, the direct cost of a new coal or nuclear power plant ranges from $3 billion to $6 billion per GW (not including the full cost to the environment from CO2 emissions or storage of spent nuclear fuel, respectively); another example is the Apollo missions to the Moon cost a grand total of $24 billion (1970s' dollars), taking inflation into account, would cost $140 billion today, more expensive than the construction of the International Space Station.|$|E

500|$|While he {{was waiting}} for his paper to be published, O'Neill {{organized}} a small two-day conference in May 1974 at Princeton to discuss the possibility of colonizing outer space. The conference, titled First Conference on Space Colonization, was funded by Stewart Brand's Point Foundation and Princeton University. Among those who attended were Eric Drexler (at the time a freshman at MIT), scientist-astronaut Joe Allen (from Astronaut Group 6), Freeman Dyson, and science reporter Walter Sullivan. Representatives from NASA also attended and brought estimates of <b>launch</b> <b>costs</b> expected on the planned Space Shuttle. O'Neill thought of the attendees as [...] "a band of daring radicals". Sullivan's article on the conference was published {{on the front page of}} The New York Times on May 13, 1974. As media coverage grew, O'Neill was inundated with letters from people who were excited about living in space. To stay in touch with them, O'Neill began keeping a mailing list and started sending out updates on his progress. A few months later he heard Peter Glaser speak about solar power satellites at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. O'Neill realized that, by building these satellites, his space colonies could quickly recover the cost of their construction. According to O'Neill, [...] "the profound difference between this and everything else done in space is the potential of generating large amounts of new wealth".|$|E
