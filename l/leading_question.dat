[...] Further, the court ruled that [...] "The 'Kong' and 'King Kong' names are widely used by the general public and are associated with apes and other objects of enormous proportions." [...] As for Universal's survey, the court found it unconvincing, as Universal did not own the [...] "image [...] [...] [...] of King Kong climbing the Empire State Building/World Trade Center with Fay Wray/Jessica Lange in his paw" [...] and that by only soliciting opinions from people who already had Donkey Kong games, the survey failed to establish confusion from potential customers.

2500|$|An {{example of}} an A-not-A {{question}} in English is in (1.a) [...] "Are you happy or sad?". The {{response to this question}} must be an echo answer, stating either [...] "I am happy," [...] or the correct alternative, [...] "I am sad". In other words, this sentence is a <b>leading</b> <b>question,</b> where the speaker has an expectation as to what the answer will be. In contrast, (1.b) [...] "Are you happy or not?" [...] is a neutral question where the answer to this can be yes or no in response to the first and more explicitly stated alternative.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{consultation}} on the 2011 census the British Humanist Association raised several concerns about question 20, [...] "What is your religion?".

It contended that by placing the religion question near the ethnicity question it would encourage some responders to associate religion with cultural identity. The BHA also ran adverts during March 2011 encouraging the use of the 'no religion' box in the questionnaire ...|$|E
5000|$|Although Rule 611(c) of the Federal Rules of Evidence (and {{comparable}} {{rules of}} many states) do not prohibit <b>leading</b> <b>questions</b> on re-direct, {{some states have}} expressly limited the use of <b>leading</b> <b>questions</b> on re-direct. As a practical matter, it rests within the trial court's discretion as to what <b>leading</b> <b>questions</b> may be asked on re-direct. Generally speaking, <b>leading</b> <b>questions</b> will be more liberally permitted on re-direct {{in order to establish}} a foundation and call the attention of the witness to specific testimony elicited on cross examination. Additionally, on re-direct, an interrogator will often ask questions which specifically seek to elicit whether an inference resulting from questioning on cross examinations is accurate. Although these type of questions will likely result in a [...] "yes" [...] or [...] "no" [...] response, they are properly understood to be direct <b>questions,</b> not <b>leading</b> <b>questions,</b> and are permissible.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{study of}} factors which may {{influence}} responses to <b>leading</b> <b>questions</b> within a questionnaire format. As such, this study provides insight into how and why <b>leading</b> <b>questions</b> exert social influence in the expression of attitudes. Following an extensive interdisciplinary review of the literature, the effects of questionnaire wording are initially proposed {{as a form of}} experimenter bias; it is then pointed out that the respondents' motives in participating in a study have been identified as key to understanding the experimenter bias process. From there, the motives associated informational social influence, and normative social influence, are proposed as intervening motives when subjects yield to <b>leading</b> <b>questions.</b> The personality variables of social desirability (or approval dependency) and self-monitoring were predicted to predispose individuals to yield to <b>leading</b> <b>questions.</b> This investigation was conducted within an opinion poll paradigm, whereby subjects completed an opinion poll with <b>leading</b> <b>questions</b> embedded within it; the <b>leading</b> <b>questions</b> for this study suggest their desired responses through parenthesized, numeric suggestions, or cognitive anchors. In order to test the various hypotheses, different conditions were created by varying the introductory remarks of the opinion poll. Support for the role of informational social influence in yielding to <b>leading</b> <b>questions</b> was provided by the finding that people yield more to <b>leading</b> <b>questions</b> which are apparently designed by experts (professional pollsters) than by nonexperts (highschool students). Support for the role of normative social influence was provided by the significant association between responses which subjects provide for themselves, and responses which they provide to represent those of their peers [...] i. e., subjects they tend to assume that their biased responses are congruent with those of their peers. The personality variables of social desirability and self-monitoring were also found to affect responses to leading questions; the relationship between these two variables appears to be interactive, and not compounded as predicted. A post-hoc study suggests that the results may be confounded by the situational demands of the questionnaire, such as a situational demand for "honesty". This study's particular form of <b>leading</b> <b>questions</b> may have also confounded the results, and more varied forms of <b>leading</b> <b>questions</b> would be worthy of future investigation...|$|R
50|$|Leading {{questions}} {{should not}} be used on the direct examination of a witness except as may be necessary to develop the witness' testimony.

2500|$|The Edinburgh Agreement {{stated that}} {{the wording of the}} {{question}} would be decided by the Scottish Parliament and reviewed for intelligibility by the Electoral Commission. The Scottish government stated that its preferred question was [...] "Do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country?" [...] The Electoral Commission tested the proposed question along with three other possible versions. Their research found that the [...] "Do you agree" [...] preface made it a <b>leading</b> <b>question,</b> which {{would be more likely to}} garner a positive response. The question was amended to [...] "Should Scotland be an independent country?", which the Electoral Commission found was the most neutral and concise of the versions tested.|$|E
2500|$|Pascal {{says that}} unbelievers who rest {{content with the}} many-religions {{objection}} are people whose scepticism has seduced them into a fatal [...] "repose".

Their objection might be sufficient were the subject concerned merely some [...] "question in philosophy", but not [...] "here, where everything is at stake". In [...] "a matter where they themselves, their eternity, their all are concerned", they can manage no better than [...] "a superficial reflection" [...] ("une reflexion légère") and, thinking they have scored a point by asking a <b>leading</b> <b>question,</b> they go off to amuse themselves.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{people may}} be better [...] "lie detectors" [...] than others, better able to {{distinguish}} a lie by facial expression, cadence of speech, certain movements, consistency, and other methods. According to David J. Lieberman, PhD, in Never Be Lied to Again: How to Get the Truth in Five Minutes or Less in Any Conversation or Situation, these methods can be learned. Some methods of questioning {{may be more likely}} to elicit the truth, for instance: [...] "When was the last time you smoked marijuana?" [...] (a <b>leading</b> <b>question)</b> is more likely to get a truthful answer than [...] "Do you smoke pot?" [...] Asking the question most likely to get the information you want is a skill and can be learned. Avoiding vague questioning will help avoid lies of omission or vagueness.|$|E

2500|$|Biological psychology, {{also known}} as {{physiological}} psychology, or neuropsychology {{is the study of}} the biological substrates of behavior and mental processes. Key research topics in this field include comparative psychology, which studies humans in relation to other animals, and perception which involves the physical mechanics of sensation as well as neural and mental processing. For centuries, a <b>leading</b> <b>question</b> in biological psychology has been whether and how mental functions might be localized in the brain. From Phineas Gage to H. M. and Clive Wearing, [...] have inspired new discoveries in this area. Modern neuropsychology could be said to originate in the 1870s, when in France Paul Broca traced production of speech to the left frontal gyrus, thereby also demonstrating hemispheric lateralization of brain function. Soon after, Carl Wernicke identified a related area necessary for the understanding of speech.|$|E
2500|$|The Face of Boe is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who. Not portrayed on-screen by an actor, the Face of Boe is a wholly mechanical effect, resembling a gigantic human-like head with a weathered face and in place of hair, numerous tendrils which terminate in round pod-like structures. Typically it is encased in a clear sealed container and mounted on a movable pedestal base. The Face merely grunted during his appearance in [...] "The End of the World", communicated telepathically in [...] "New Earth" [...] and [...] "Gridlock", and spoke {{for the first and}} last time in the latter, and was voiced by Struan Rodger. It is stated in [...] "New Earth" [...] that he is thought to be millions of years old (billions, at least according to [...] "Gridlock"); however, when this was suggested to him, he responded with a <b>leading</b> <b>question</b> concerning the impossibility of such an age. It was suggested in [...] "Last of the Time Lords" [...] that the Face of Boe is a future Jack Harkness.|$|E

In Study 1, observers rated the informativeness and empathy of questions classified as diagnostic or leading, and as matching or not matching a hypothesis (extroversion-introversion). In an impression formation setting, observers rated both matching and diagnostic questions as especially informative, {{but in an}} impression Verification setting, they rated <b>leading</b> <b>questions</b> as especially informative. Across settings, matching and <b>leading</b> <b>questions</b> both displayed empathy. In Study 2, participants expected to interview an introverted or extroverted person, under either an information-seeking or an empathy goal. Interviewers favoured matching questions, especially under an empathy goal. Interviewers also selected more diagnostic than <b>leading</b> <b>questions.</b> Interviewers and observers both consider matching questions informative, with {{the added benefit of}} showing empathy to smooth the interaction...|$|R
