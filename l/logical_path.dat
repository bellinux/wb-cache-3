To serve pedestrians well, a rectangular configuration and high frequency of streets and intersections is the preferred route, which the orthogonal grid geometry provides. To reduce development costs and environmental impact, lower frequency of streets is the <b>logical</b> <b>path.</b> Since these two design objectives are contradictory a balance needs to be struck. Such balance has been achieved in leading modern projects such as Vauban, Freiburg and Village Homes, Davis.

In 1726, Leonard Welsted's indifferent success, The Dissembled Woman, was acted at Lincoln's Inn Fields. It netted him £138 for the author's benefit but only £30 for the printing rights.

50|$|Data is {{transmitted}} {{as if it}} were passing through private connections. Prior to transmission packets are encapsulated (wrapped) in a new packet, with a new header. Contained in the header is routing information. This <b>logical</b> <b>path</b> that the encapsulated packets travel through is called a tunnel. When each packet reaches the tunnel endpoint, it is “decapsulated” and forwarded to its final destination. Both tunnel endpoints need to support the same tunnelling protocol. Tunnelling protocols are operated at either layer 2 or layer 3 of the OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection).  Layer-2 VPN uses the layer 2 frame such as the Ethernet while layer-3 uses layer 3 packets such as IP.  Layer-3 VPN starts at layer 3, where it discards the incoming layer-2 frame and generates a new layer-2 frame at the destination. The most commonly used tunnelling protocols are IPsec, L2TP, PPTP and SSL. A packet with a private non-routable IP address can be sent inside a packet with globally unique IP address, thereby extending a private network over the Internet.|$|E

5000|$|Some debuggers allow {{registers}} {{or program}} variables in memory {{to be modified}} before resuming, effectively allowing the introduction of [...] "hand-coded" [...] temporary assignments for test purposes. Similarly, program instructions can often be skipped {{to determine the effect}} of changes to the program logic - enabling questions about program execution to be answered in a direct way (i.e. without assumptions or guesswork). In many cases it may be the only practical method of testing obscure [...] "event-driven" [...] error subroutines that rarely, if ever, get executed - without the added risk of leaving temporary source changes. Manually changing the resume location within a paused program can be used to enter an otherwise rarely executed section of code (such as a specific hardware condition handler). Implementing data breakpoints in software however, can greatly reduce the performance of the application being debugged - since it is using additional resources on the same processor. However, this is normally acceptable during testing and the amount of information available from the debugger is not restricted by limitations of debug data known to the hardware. For instance, a software implementation can collect <b>logical</b> <b>path</b> data at program/subroutine/instruction level to considerably augment what might be stored by the particular hardware platform for inspection.
