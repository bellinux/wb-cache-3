25|$|An early {{scientific}} study of mercury poisoning was in 1923–6 by the German inorganic chemist, Alfred Stock, who himself became poisoned, together with his colleagues, by breathing mercury vapor that was being released by his laboratory equipment—diffusion pumps, float valves, and manometers—all of which contained mercury, and also from mercury that had been accidentally spilt and remained in cracks in the <b>linoleum</b> <b>floor</b> covering. He published {{a number of papers}} on mercury poisoning, founded a committee in Berlin to study cases of possible mercury poisoning, and introduced the term micromercurialism.|$|E
25|$|The library {{aimed to}} provide open {{access to all}} its 900,000 volumes. No {{basement}} was possible because of the low level roads beneath the library and a tall book stack was deemed inappropriate because of the desire to keep {{the height of the}} building low, so it did not overwhelm the surrounding buildings. Storage of the volumes was on the same level as the reading areas: this dual function led to the low ceiling height of three metres. Space was created in the reference library by opening up sections of the floors into double height reading spaces. The furniture for the library was specified by the architects, with a preference for oak veneer book stacks and black <b>linoleum</b> <b>floor</b> covering.|$|E
