40|$|Abstract. From the {{perspective}} of stress and heat distribution, the influence of material and heat on working reliability of the turret seal is analysed. Based on the actual working condition of a servo turret, the FEA (finite element analysis) of structural mechanics and thermal structural coupling is carried out on the key reciprocating seal between piston and oil cylinder. The analysis re that material hardness and temperature have great influence on the seal contact pressure and the leakage. To be specific, the lower seal material hardness leads to the lower maximum contact stress and <b>longer</b> seal’s <b>service</b> <b>life</b> without increasing the net leakage under 3. 5 Mpa oil pressure. The result demonstrates that the material with hardness 90 is better than that with hardness 95 under the hydraulic pressure 3. 5 Mpa. Besides, temperature distribution of seal under the working condition is gained through the thermal structural coupling analysis. It is concluded that increasing temperature lead to decreased leakage and enhanced contact stress. Consequently, {{the influence of the}} temperature should be taken into consideration on the research of seal numerical model...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{sustained}} corona discharge in insulating oil lowers its dielectric strength and simultaneously reduces its corona resistance. Therefore, for operating stresses in the corona regime, activity typically increases with time and, if allowed to continue, eventually leads to breakdown of the oil and failure of the component or system. It is, therefore, common practice to periodically replace oil in devices such as large power transformers and switch gear before breakdown occurs. Sealed components such as capacitors are typically replaced. Recent experiments have demonstrated that the dielectric properties of corona weakened oil can not only be restored, but actually improved by a simple regeneration process. These experiments were carried out on high voltage pulse transformer windings which were operated at high rep rates until partial discharges formed. Reprocessing the oil after each operating cycle resulted in successively longer operational periods before partial discharges appeared. In a separate experiment, a process was developed to precondition transformer oil to raise its corona inception voltage before using it to insulate a high voltage component, thus giving it a <b>longer</b> initial <b>service</b> <b>life</b> for a given operating stress or permitting higher stress operation for limited operating times...|$|R

40|$|Owing to the {{assurance}} of <b>longer</b> reliable <b>service</b> <b>life</b> and greater customer peace of mind, products with a lifetime warranty {{are becoming more}} and more popular. Under such policies, both the manufacturer and the buyer are exposed to uncertainties and risks of warranty pricing and product performance since product lifetimes are uncertain and are not well defined in these policies. Considering the uncertainties in the measure of lifetime (useful life), this paper extends previous work of the authors [Rahman, A., & Chattopadhay, G. N. (2010). Modelling risks to manufacturer and buyer for lifetime warranty policies. International Journal of Management Science and Engineering Management, 5, 203 – 209] to determine the optimal warranty price. Risk preference models are developed to find the optimal warranty price through the use of the manufacturer’s utility function for profit and the buyer’s utility function for repair costs. The sensitivity of the risk preferences models are analysed using numerical examples with respect to factors such as the buyer’s and the manufacturer/dealer’s risk preferences, the buyer’s anticipated and the manufacturer’s estimated product failure intensity, the buyer’s loyalty to the original manufacturer/dealer in repairing failed products, and the buyer’s repair costs for non-warrantied products. Analysis of the developed models reveals that the manufacturer’s decisions on warranty price are strictly related to useful life, failure intensity of the product, and risk preferences. On the other hand, the buyer’s acceptance of a lifetime warranty depends on the expected lifetime of the product, the buyer’s anticipated product failure intensity, anticipated repair costs, and most importantly the buyer’s risk preference.
