50|$|Nothing {{relating}} to the Lever family descent was recorded as to the second moiety of the manor, from 1310 to 1448, when Henry Lever the elder, Giles, and Henry the younger, a son of Giles, held it on a <b>lease</b> <b>for</b> <b>life</b> of Alice, widow of Sir Robert Tempest. Despite the absence of satisfactory evidence of the family descent some facts can be stated; that in 1320 William de Radcliffe and William de Lever held Lever by homage, service, and suit {{to the court of}} Manchester and that they paid 4d sake fee for the lands being Lever held by Ellis de Lever. They also paid 6s 8d in rent and 12d in lieu of the hawk. In 1331 a settlement of a moiety of the manor was made by Ellis de Lever in favour of his son and his issue by Agnes his wife. The documents show that the Radcliffes were responsible for the whole rent but it also appears that the Lever half of the manor had been granted away, but to whom is not known.|$|E
5000|$|A {{fireplace}} {{with the}} inscription [...] "H.T.E. 1576" [...] was recorded by Westropp & Twigge in the 1890s, {{as being in}} the castle. This {{was one of the}} earliest dated fireplaces in the county, though it cannot now be located within the castle. In 1586 Queen Elizabeth I issued a pardon to Hugh, son of Covea MacNamara, of Ballyhannon Castle for being in rebellion. He had to provide sureties for his future good behaviour and answer at the local courts as requested. In the 1626 rental of the 5th Earl of Thomond, Henry O'Brien (c.1588 - 1639), Ballyhannon Castle was listed as being rented to one Robert Hawksworth, with one quarter of land for the sum of £4.00. It is likely that Hawksworth was one of the many English Protestant settlers brought into the county by the O'Briens and settled on the O'Brien properties in Thomond during this period. The settling of English Protestants on lands of the native Irish Catholics precipitated the 1641 rebellion and many records exist of the Irish despoiling the settlers and turning them out of their newly acquired lands and properties. The MacNamaras of Ballyhannon acted no differently from the other displaced Irish. John Smith of Latoon complained of his losses which, [...] "amounted to £1,354, including his <b>lease</b> <b>for</b> <b>life</b> of Lattoon, and his outlay upon buildings and sea embankments." [...] He complained that Oliver Delahoyde of Fomerla Castle in Tulla, [...] "with fifty men came, on the night of 15 January 1642, and stripped him of part of his goods. The work of spoilation was subsequently completed by the MacNamaras of Ballyhannon" [...] among others. Most of the Irish landowners who took part in this rebellion were later stripped of their possessions. Among those noted as having forfeited their property after the rebellion was Mahone MacNamara of Ballyhannon. His property was disposed of to Pierce Creagh (a Protestant settler) and to the Earl of Thomond, Barnabas O'Brien (c.1590 - 1657), 6th Earl. After the rebellion, the Cromwellian campaign attempted to complete the subjugation of the native Irish, and many of their castles were dismantled by the Commonwealth forces to render them defenceless. Ballyhannon appears to have escaped this destruction and a sketch of the castle in 1675, which survives in the [...] "Edenvale Survey", shows it to have been roofed and in good condition. The castle appears to be surrounded by a bawn wall with a gate and loophole windows at this time. With the assention to the English throne of the Catholic King James II (14 October 1633 - 16 September 1701) in 1685, the fate of the native Irish improved somewhat for a time. Ballyhannon Castle was one of the castles noted by Sir Daniel O'Brien, Viscount Clare, as being suitable for the imprisonment of Protestant settlers who were now being dispossessed. A letter written in 1689 describing the events of the time is worth recording. [...] "Take every one of them that are young (Seir or Mr.), and let the common sort lie in the prison, and the rest strictly guarded, or rather put into some strong castle that has a geate to be locked on the outside like Ballyhannon". Pierce Creagh who had received part of the MacNamara property at Ballyhannon after the rebellion was named as one of those to be imprisoned in the above letter from Sir Daniel O'Brien. The castle is also mentioned in 1690 when Thomas Hickman, who seemed to be living in fear during another upsurge in the conflict, asked Sir Donough O'Brien to collect some of his belongings from Ballyhannon Castle and to keep other possessions of his in a safe place, as he expected the castle was soon to be garrisoned.|$|E
40|$|Equity release {{products}} are sorely needed in {{an aging population}} {{with high levels of}} home ownership. There has been a growing literature analyzing risk components and capital adequacy of reverse mortgages in recent years. However, little research has been done on the risk analysis of other equity release products, such as home reversion contracts. This is partly due to the dominance of reverse mortgage products in equity release markets worldwide. In this article we compare cash flows and risk profiles from the provider's perspective for reverse mortgage and home reversion contracts. An at-home/in long-term care split termination model is employed to calculate termination rates, and a vector autoregressive (VAR) model is used to depict the joint dynamics of economic variables including interest rates, house prices, and rental yields. We derive stochastic discount factors from the no arbitrage condition and price the no negative equity guarantee in reverse mortgages and the <b>lease</b> <b>for</b> <b>life</b> agreement in the home reversion plan accordingly. We compare expected payoffs and assess riskiness of these two equity release products via commonly used risk measures: Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) ...|$|E

50|$|In 1470, James Boneython {{appeared}} to be in possession of the manor of Trelowth, and an inspection was made in order for it to be <b>leased</b> <b>for</b> <b>life</b> to four others. In circa 1488, a grant was made by Thomas Lovell to Nicholas Crowmere of an annual rent of 50 marks (£33-6-8) that included Trelowthe and several other manors with reversion to Henry VII upon the death of Crowmere and his sons. The Trenhayle family was associated with the village in the Middle Ages and owned Trelowth Manor and Trenhayle Manor. George Trenhayle, who {{is said to have been}} the last of the family who possessed Trenhayle, was buried at St Erth in 1687; no remains of his ancient mansion house, Trenhayle Manor, are visible. Trelowth Manor, near the village of Sticker, later became property of the St. Aubyn family and Tredgea family. The manor was surrounded by extensive woods, mentioned in many medieval documents. These were felled to pave the way for the Polgooth mine in the 17th century. A smelting house for tin was established in Trelowth, presumably to cater to the nearby mine.|$|R
40|$|Community-based {{preventative}} programmes {{are increasing}} in demand as the UK seeks {{alternative ways of}} supporting {{the growing number of}} older adults. As the use and promotion of preventative programmes increase, so does the need for evidence supporting their effectiveness. Through the use of mixed methods, this study explored a singing community-arts programme, the Golden Oldies, {{to determine the extent to}} which the programme contributes to participants' (n = 120) sense of health, self-development and social connectedness. Quantitative analyses found that between 73. 1 and 98. 3 per cent of participants agreed or strongly agreed that the Golden Oldies contributed to their self-development, health and sense of community as well as revealing a statistically significant increase in self-reported health prior to participation in the programme to the time of the study. Qualitative analysis (n = 5) revealed three themes—the Golden Oldies as: (i) a reduction in social isolation and increase in social contact; (ii) a therapeutic source; and (iii) a new <b>lease</b> <b>for</b> <b>life.</b> The results provide evidence of the preventative nature of the Golden Oldies programme through self-reported improvements in health and social relationships where social connections appeared to be the important thread that contributed to the perceived benefits. Implications for policy, practice and research are discussed...|$|E

The 1890s, however, saw an expansion of the Navy, and in 1895 an Act of Congress provided for the retirement of numerous Revenue Cutter Service officers who were too ill or too old to perform their duties.
