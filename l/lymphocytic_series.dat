50|$|A {{prolymphocyte}} is a {{white blood}} cell with a certain state of cellular differentiation in lymphocytopoiesis.

Today it is believed that the differentiation of cells in the lymphocyte line is not always simply chronologic but rather depends on antigen exposure, such that, for example, lymphocytes can become lymphoblasts.|$|E

40|$|Case history: Malignant {{lymphoma}} is a neoplastic proliferative {{process of}} the lymphopoietic portion of the reticuloendothelial system that involves cells of either the <b>lymphocytic</b> or histiocytic <b>series</b> in varying degrees of differentiation and occurs in an essentially homogenous population of a single cell type. The character of histologic involvement is either diffuse (uniform) or nodular {{and the distribution of}} involvement may be regional or systemic (generalized), the process basically being multicentric. A case of oral cavity lymphoma was detected and after various panel of imunnohistochemical (IHC) markers it was diagnosed as Anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) of oral cavity.

40|$|The spleen of the Australian {{lungfish}} (Neocerarodus forsteri, barrammunda) {{was investigated}} histologically. The chief findings are as follows. The spleen of the lungfish {{is embedded in}} the wall of the stomach and localized in the submucosal layer, like that of larval Lampetra. The central arteries are ensheathed by a mass of densely aggregated cells. The mass resembles the periarterial lymphoid sheath of mammalian spleens. However, it consists of two types of collections of <b>lymphocytic</b> and granulocytic <b>series.</b> It is, therefore, essentially a periarterial lymphomyeloid sheath; it has no erythropoietic capacity. Surrounding the sheath is the red pulp region. The central artery, beyond the sheath, extends into the red pulp and branches off; the penicillary arteries. The terminal portion of the penicillary artery is surrounded by an ellipsoidal sheath of reticular cells. This portion, the shcathed capillary and ellipsoid, opens directly into the meshes of the red pulp reticulum. Thus, the spleen of the lungfish has three major elements [...] the periarterial lymphoid sheath, the ellipsoid and the red pulp. These findings indicate that the spleen of the lungfish is primitive in topography but it is well developed in its microscopic structure, like that of higher vertebrates...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Non-human {{primates}} (NHP) {{are frequently}} used in preclinical research, including xenotransplantation studies. Cytological examination of bone marrow (BM) is a helpful adjunct {{for a complete}} interpretation of hematological data. In this light, {{the aim of this}} work is to evaluate the cellular composition of BM in immunosuppressed xenotransplanted NHP. Materials and Methods: Ten NHP recipients of a life-supporting porcine kidney were treated with Cyclosporin A, steroids, Mycophenolate sodium, with Cyclophosphamide (CYP) (N= 6) or Rituximab (N= 4). Eight animals were euthanized for kidney failure and 2 for life-threatening conditions. A complete pre-euthanasia CBC and 4 femoral BM smears collected at euthanasia were performed. Cytological evaluations and differential counts of erythroid, granulocytic, <b>lymphocytic</b> and plasmacytic <b>series</b> were performed. Megakariocytic series elements were evaluated with regards to number, morphology and maturation. The myeloid to erythroid ratio (M:E) was calculated and the percentage of each cell line was established. Results: No significant interindividual differences in marrow cytology were observed. A severe erythroid hypoplasia and myeloid hyperplasia with marked increase of M:E ratio (from 26, 8 : 1 to 80 : 1) were observed except in one case (4 : 1). Increase of plasma cells percentage (8 - 19 %, median 11 %) was observed in all recipients except in one case (1, 4 %). Megakaryocytic lineage was normally represented. Despite of erithropoietin therapy, erythroid hypoplasia was observed, possibly {{as a consequence of the}} immunosuppressive therapy or of the suppressive effect of inflammatory cytokines on hematopoietic precursors. The increase in proliferative and maturative neutrophilic lineage was correlated with the inflammatory status. The meaning of plasma cells increase is still unclear. However, this was not correlated with anti-pig antibody levels. Conclusion: The study suggests that BM evaluation in primate recipients of renal porcine xenografts may provide the basis for a complete interpretation of hematological profiles and represent an important tool for a better design of immunosuppressive strategies...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} on bone marrow samples obtained from 15 clinically normal Libyan Barbary sheep. Haemopoietic cells, including those of myelocytic series, erythrocytic series, megakaryocytic series, lymphocytes, plasma cells, monocytes and mitotic cells were identified {{on the basis of}} their morphological characteristics in May-Grünwald-Giemsa stained bone marrow smears. Cytochemical reactions of bone marrow cells revealed that all granulocytes, except myeloblasts and basophils, were peroxidase positive. Monocytes were peroxidase negative, but very few of them showed weak activity. Cells of the erythrocytic, megakaryocytic and <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>series</b> were peroxidase negative. Granulocytic series cells were Sudan black B positive, except myeloblasts. Some monocytes were positive with a few scattered black granules, while others were negative. Cells of erythrocytic, megakaryocytic and <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>series</b> were Sudan black B negative. Granulocytes at all stages of development reacted positively to periodic acid-Shiff, except myeloblasts. Monocytes were either completely negative or positive. Some lymphocytes showed a few fine or even coarse periodic acid-Shiff positive granules in the cytoplasm. Megakaryocytes were periodic acid-Shiff positive, while all cells of the erythrocytic series were periodic acid-Shiff negative.

40|$|Experience in the {{treatment}} of 326 consecutive cases of chronic leukemia by the method of titrated, regularly-spaced, total-body irradiation with P 32 or x-ray has told us much about pitfalls in the analysis of survival data, the biology of leukemia, and radiobiology. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to summarize what we have learned. However, all who plan to use the method should read all of the references cited. The population studied includes every case of chronic lymphocytic and granulocytic leukemia referred for treatment between January 1, 1941, and June 30, 1954. The first series of 163 patients was seen prior to July 1, 1951, and has been reported (1 - 4). Twenty four of this series were treated with total body x-ray, all others with P@. The second series of 163 patients has not been previ ously reported. Of the 326, 212 were lymphocytic leukemias and 114 were granu locytic leukemias. The relevant categories of the population are shown in Tables I, II, and III. The age range at onset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia is from 27 to 92, for chronic granulocytic leukemia from 3 to 81. The sex distribution is about equal in the granulocytic series, but about twice as many men as women develop lymphocytic leukemia. The distribution of leukocyte counts in these patients fits a log normal distribution with a median of 40, 000 for the <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>series</b> and of 90, 000 for the granulocytic series (Figs. 4 and 5 in ref. 5). Forty of the <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>series</b> were subleukemic with counts before treatment less than 15, 000; only 6 of the granulocytic patients were subleukemic.

40|$|A {{preceding}} paper {{described the}} ultrastructure of antibody-forming cells of mice and rabbits studied in considerable numbers (1). In confirmation {{of previous studies}} from this and other laboratories, it was shown that lymphocytes and plasmacytes {{in various stages of}} differentiation contributed to the heterogeneity of the antibody-producing cells (2 - 8). Morphological forms suggesting transition between cells of the lymphocytic and of the plasmacytic series were also described (1). A comparison of cells forming rosettes with those producing plaques showed that the rosette-forming cells (RFC) I were largely in the <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>series,</b> whereas the plaque-forming cells (PFC) were largely plasmacytic (1). For further study of antibody-producing cells, especially {{in the early stages of}} proliferation and antibody release, RFC were chosen, since the number of rosettes produced by a given suspension of antibody-producing cells is many times the number of plaques, so that rosette formation would clearly provide the more sensitive technic.

40|$|Background: Non-human {{primates}} (NHP) {{are used}} in pre-clinical studies, such as pig-to-NHP xenotransplantation. In this context, the evaluation of clinical-pathological data is essential for monitoring the post-transplantation period. Cytological examination of bone marrow (BM) is a helpful adjunct for a complete interpretation of haematological data. The aim of this work is to evaluate the cytology of BM and haematological data in immunosuppressed (IS) xenotransplanted NHP. Methods: Sixty-two xenografted NHP were included: 36 recipients of porcine renal xenograft (RX group) and 17 recipients of neuronal precursors (NPX group). Both groups received a maintenance immunosuppression with cyclosporine A, sodium mycophenolate and steroids. RX group received an induction therapy consistent of cyclophosphamide and/or GAS 914, or rituximab, or IVIG or anti-CD 154; NPX received cyclosporine A and GAS 914. A complete CBC and femoral BM smears collected at euthanasia were obtained. BM cytological evaluation and differential counts of erythroid, granulocytic, megakaryocytic, <b>lymphocytic</b> and plasmacytic <b>series</b> were performed. The myeloid-to-erythroid ratio (M:E), the erythroid (E-MI) and myeloid (M-MI) maturation indices were calculated. Results: Compare to the reference range, 44 NHP showed an increased M:E ratio (> 1. 85) due to myeloid hyperplasia and erythroid hypoplasia. In 16 cases the M:E ratio was severely increased (> 5. 45). Both E-MI and M-MI were raised in 61 and 57 cases, respectively. The highest values of M:E and M-MI were recorded in the RX group. The main haemathological alterations observed were anemia (54 / 62 NHP), leucopenia (15 / 62) and lymphopenia (25 / 62). Cytoplasmatic and nuclear vacuolization, dysplastic changes in granulocytic and erythroid lineages were the main morphological alterations in BM probably due to toxic effects of IS therapy. In spite of IS therapy, xenografted NHP showed a myeloid hyperplasia, mainly in RX group {{probably due to the}} marked inflammatory status during acute rejection. Conclusions: The BM evaluation in xenografted IS NHP may provide the basis for a complete interpretation of hematological profiles and represent an important tool for a better design of IS strategies...|$|R

40|$|Initiation of {{immunological}} events {{following the}} exposure of immunocompetent cells to antigen is believed to include as an early essential step combination between preformed, cell-attached antibodies and immunogen. The exact location of this (these) inducing event(s) is unknown, but indirect information suggests this {{takes place at the}} outer surface of the relevant immunocyte. Cells of the <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>series</b> can be shown capable of selective binding of antigen to the outer cell membrane (1 - 3) and immunocompetent cells have enough surface-attached antibodies to allow selective retention when cells are allowed to filter through antigen-coated columns (4). It is well documented that certain small lymphocytes actively synthesize immunoglobulinlike molecules (S) which are on display on the cell surface (6, 7). That these latter molecules have antigen-binding specificity is suggested by the fact that adherence of antigen to lymphoid cells can be blocked by preincubating the cells with antibodies directed against serum immunoglobulins (8, 9). This latter finding demonstIates antigenic similarities between humoral antibodies and structures adjacent to the antigen-binding sites present on the surface of certain lymphoid cells.

40|$|An {{important}} {{procedure for}} providing {{information concerning the}} site of development of various types of immune response, {{and the manner in}} which they are put into effect, involves the passive transfer of immunity to normal individuals. It is now widely believed that the destructive reaction of individuals against vascularized solid tissue homografts is put into effect by immunologically "activated " cells of the <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>series,</b> rather than by humoral antibodies (I, 2). For several years this concept rested principally upon evidence that homograft sensitivity could only be transferred passively (more correctly "adoptively") by means of living cells obtained from the lymph nodes or spleens of specifically immunized animals (3 - 5), Nevertheless, a well recognized weakness of this thesis was the failure of attempts to transfer sensitivity by means of whole blood, leucocyte concentrates, or peritoneal exudates (3 - 5). Subsequent evidence that the lymphocyte population of the blood of birds and mammals includes immunologically competent elements (6 - 9) hinted that this failure may merely have reflected shortcomings of technique, such as lack o...|$|E
40|$|The {{successful}} {{initiation of}} a primary antibody response in tissue culture has been reported by several workers (1 [...] 4). In a previous report from this laboratory (3) {{it has been suggested}} that the sequential action of at least two different types of cells was responsible for the formation of antibody in tissue culture. One type was a mononucleated cell with phagocytic activity, referred to as a macrophage, and the other was a non-phagocytic cell belonging to the <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>series.</b> The macrophage, presumably a non-antibody [...] producing cell, was thought to interact with the antigen yielding a product which in some manner stimulated the production of specific antibody in the lymphocytic cells.

40|$|The {{response}} {{of an animal}} to antigen is altered after its first exposure. The intensified secondary response has been attributed by some {{to the presence of}} qualitatively different "memory " cells. The concept of two types of antigen-sensitive ceils, occurring as successive stages in immunoeyte maturation, was elaborated by Burner (i) and Leduc et al. (2), and later into an X-Y-Z scheme by Sercarz and Coons (3). In the X-Y-Z formulation, the X ceil is the first antigen-sensitive ceil in the <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>series,</b> which upon stimulation is converted into a Y or memory cell. Triggering of Y ceils by antigen results in division and irreversible maturation to a plasmacytic series of Z cells whose terminal member is the mature, antibody-producing plasma cell. a ~terzl also uses this terminology (4). Two major states of antigen-induced unresponsiveness have been described; immune paralysis or tolerance (5, 6) and immune exhaustion (4). Although unresponsiveness in both immunologically naive and experienced animals has been documented and discussed, the two categories have never been dearly distinguished.

40|$|The direct {{demonstration}} by McMaster and Hudack (1) of {{the production}} of antibody in lymph nodes led to a long search for the cell in the lymph node which synthesized antibody. Early evidence by Harris, Grimm, Mertens, and Ehrich (2), Dougherty, Chase, and White (3), and Harris and Harris (4) that the lymphocyte was the cell of synthesis {{was followed by the}} studies of BjSrnehoe and Gormsen (5), and Fagraeus (6) indicating the plasma cell as the cell which produced antibody. The following years produced studies of the cellular source of antibody by at least six experimental approaches, each of which led some authors to conclude that the plasmacytic series of cells was involved, and others, the <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>series</b> (7). The culmination, in 1955, of this decade and a half of intensive research was the actual finding of antibody within plasma cells, by Coons and his colleagues (8 - 10), using the indirect fluorescent antibody technique.

40|$|Membrane {{complement}} receptors {{have been}} identified on a subpopulation of normal lymphocytes containing cytoplasmic inclusions called parallel tubular arrays (PTA) using two different rosetting techniques. The first technique utilizes as indicator cells erythrocytes that were coated with complement by the classic pathway of complement activation (EAC rosettes). The second technique utilizes as indicator cells Salmonella typhi, which were coated with complement by the alternate pathway of complement activation (FBC rosettes). In the latter technique, lipopolysaccharide material in the bacterial cell wall directly activates complement {{without the use of}} a sensitizing antibody. This eliminates binding of marker particles by lymphocytes having Fc receptors. The presence of PTA lymphocytes at the center of EAC rosettes and FBC rosettes was demonstrated by electron microscopy, indicating that the PTA lymphocyte has a complement receptor. Examination of FBC rosettes revealed that the adherent complement-coated bacteria were usually partially surrounded by pseudopodal extensions of the PTA lymphocyte. In addition, some PTA lymphocytes phagocytized the complement-coated bacteria but not the complement-inactivated bacteria.

The bodies are also often found in mesenchymal and epithelial reticular cells, but are variable in occurrence. From the frequency {{and size of the}} nuclear body in cells of <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>series,</b> it is suggested that in thymic cortex, about a half of the small lymphocytes contain a small nuclear body, and in the medulla all small lymphocytes contain a small or a large body, and in the other lymphatic organs all of small lymphocytes include two or more large, grouped, nuclear bodies.

Inoculation experiments with monkeys have recently provided further indications that Burkitt's tumour might contain such a transmissible agent (6), whilst certain viruses {{have been found in}} association with a number of patients. Thus, herpes simplex has been isolated from a small proportion of biopsy specimens (7, 8) and a reovirus has been grown from biopsy material in a single instance (9). In addition, in six other cases unidentified filtrable agents have been propagated in tissue culture from various materials including tumour (10). In the course of tissue culture experiments with samples from Burtdtt lymphomas, altered lymphoblasts have been established in continuous culture from both a maxillary turnout (11, 12) and from an ovarian turnout (13, 14). These cells have the unusual ability for members of the <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>series</b> to grow in vitro in the absence of other associated cells (12 - 14); they also show certain fine structural features suggestive of malignancy (14, 15) and have been found, when examined in the electron microscope, to carry a virus (16, 13).

When such cultures were exposed, within 24 hr after their initiation, to a high input multiplicity of virus, successful infection, as determined by immunofluorescence and plaque assays, did not become evident before the 3 rd or 4 th day. On exposure of cultures 4 to 5 days old, viral replication was detectable within 2 days. In both instances, peak immunofluorescence and virus titers were reached when the cultures were 7 to 9 days old and composed mainly of blast forms. With decreasing input multiplicities of infection, cells containing viral antigen and production of infectious viral progeny became detectable with increasing delay. No significant viral replication was noted in surviving cells maintained in the absence of PHA. These results indicate that mainly, if not solely, the PHA-stimulated cells of the <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>series</b> support viral multiplication. The extent of the infectious process was limited, however, because the life span of the cultures was not significantly shortened, the yields of infectious virus per immunofluorescent cell were at all times low, and most infected cells contained only a few well-delineated small masses of antigen, suggestive of an abortive infection. Only fresh cultures were capable of synthesizing interferon on stimulation by mumps, Newcastle disease, or Sendai viruses.

40|$|The severe prevalences of equine {{encephalomyelitis}} {{were observed in}} Hokkaido from summer to autumn, 1948 and 1950. The author has histologically investigated {{the central nervous system}} of 56 cases, which affected naturally with the malady during the prevalences. Materials examined are shown in Table 1. The summarized results obtained are as follows : (1) Grossly, characteristic changes in the central nervous system were scanty. As main findings, congestion, petechial hemorrhage and edema were observed in nervous substance and leptomeninges. There were formation of "Druckwulst (Occipital protrusion) " DEXLERs which were morphological change caused by presumably increasing cerebral pressure in 20 cases and necrotic and malactic focus in 1 each case respectively. (2) Histologic changes in the central nervous system of the entire number studied are comprehended under the diagnostic name of encephalomyelitis universalis and during the earlier stages of the disease exudative changes are prominent, but in the later stages proliferative processes take over gradually the former. (3) The total cases were classified, according to existence of tissue infiltration of polymorphonuclear leucocytes and its degree, into the three pathological stages; that is, leucocytic, transitional and nonleucocytic stages (Tables 2, 3 and 4). There were the differences to a certain extent among the stages, not only the tissue infiltration of polymorphonuclear leucocytes but also in occurrence of other inframmatory reactions and its regional distribution. These stages are closely related to the length of the disease as shown in Table 6. Namely, such difference in the nature and the distribution of lesions, it should be ascribed to the time factor and it is further considered that the severity of the disease or the natural resistance of the individual horse play also a certain role. (4) Polymorphonuclear tissue infiltration were observed in 31 cases (55 %). The majority of the cases (94 %) were those which died or were destroyed within fifth day of the contracting disease. During the earlier stage of the disease, polymorphonuclear leucocytes infiltrated diffusely throughout the central nervous system and disappeared rapidly, then were replaced by proliferative processes especially by the proliferation of the microglia cells. (5) Perivascular cuffs were observed in the whole studied cases. It came to highest degree in third to fifth day of the disease and infiltrated cells overflowed frequently from ROBIN-VIRCHOW's spaces into the surrounding parenchyma. Cellular constituents in perivascular cuffs consisted of polymorphonuclear leucocytes, lymphocytes, lymphoid cells, lymphoblasts, macrophages, plasma cells and eosinophile cells. Its constitution made discrimination on each case, but as a rule, at the earlier stage numerous polymorphonuclear leucocytes were observed and accounted for approximately 50 % of the total cells. Then cells of the <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>series</b> became gradually to main constituents. The former is apparently hematogenous and suggested {{that the majority of the}} latter should have arisen in that spot. (6) Mobilization of the neuroglia cells was very slight in the earlier stage of contracting disease, especially in the case that which showed heavy infiltration of polymorphonuclear leucocytes. When polymorphonuclear leucocytes tend to disappear, these are gradually replaced by both nodular formation and diffuse proliferation of glia cells. In all cases, microglia cells proliferated most activly and mobilization of oligodendroglia cells and astrocytes were slight. There was no proliferation of glia fibers. Rod shaped cells were observed in on and about fourth day of the disease, and as a rule, increased in number with progress of the disease. Apart from the malactic foci, gitter cells were seldom demonstrated. (7) Degeneration of the nerve cells was observed in the whole cases studied. Its degree ran usually parallel with the severity of other inflammatory...|$|E
