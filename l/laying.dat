5|$|Females {{have two}} {{openings}} located under {{the edge of}} the mantle in the mantle cavity: the opening of the vagina and an opening for <b>laying</b> eggs.

Egg cells originate in the ovary. Egg cells travel through the oviduct to the fertilization chamber, where fertilization occur. Eggs then develop in the glandular uterus. A capsule is formed in the diverticulum next to the uterus. The eggs are then laid.|$|E

40|$|<b>Lay</b> judges fulfill {{important}} {{functions for}} {{the justice system}} of a country. In the European Union member states, scholars have analysed the use of <b>lay</b> judges in criminal cases. However, {{little is known about}} <b>lay</b> participation in civil justice. The paper introduces commonly cited reasons to have <b>lay</b> judges as well as the principal forms of <b>lay</b> participation and then surveys the EU countries for its implementation in civil cases. Mixed tribunals, involving <b>lay</b> judges under the leadership of a professional judge, are relatively frequent. Several countries have special labour courts or commercial courts with <b>lay</b> members and others have single <b>lay</b> judges, or all-lay judge panels. Roughly a third of the 28 EU member states have no <b>lay</b> participation in civil justice but only three of those have no <b>lay</b> judges in any branch of the courts. Almost all the reasons for including <b>lay</b> decision makers are served somehow by the existing forms, including providing different experiences and perhaps expert knowledge. The article concludes, citing non-EU states and <b>lay</b> participation in criminal and administrative courts as further evidence, that <b>lay</b> judges {{in one form or another}} are an element of European legal systems...|$|R
