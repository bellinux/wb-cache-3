50|$|Composite liners are {{required}} {{to be used in}} municipal solid waste systems for landfills and use a double liner system which is composed of a leachate system which is a liquid that collects solids from the substance this is passed through it. The leachate system is surrounded in a by a type of solid drainage layer such as gravel which is enclosed by a geomembrane and compressed clay, also known as a geosynthetic clay liner. This geosynthetic clay liner is usually made of sodium bentonite which is compacted in between two thick pieces of geotextile. The next material surrounding the composite liner would be a <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> <b>system</b> composed of another material like gravel with an additional geomembrane or complex liner. The geomembranes within the composite liner consist of a high-density polyethylene which provide an effective minimization for flow and deliver and helpful barrier which is used on inorganic contaminants. It {{can be used as a}} substitute for sand or gravel and also has a very high transmissivity and low storage. The lower surface helps provide an effective leak test once correctly installed. It is also a low permeable vapor and liquid barrier. The geosynthetic clay liners are manufactured by factories and the purpose for it being made of sodium bentonite is that they regulate the movement of liquids in gases within the waste. The geocomposites which are a combination of the geomembranes and geosynthetic liner material also include a layer of bentonite between the middle of the layers of geotextile; however, airspace is allowed to be implemented. It is then topped off with a final cover.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 47) The {{purpose of}} this project is to explore the field of water <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> and to model and demonstrate one of many different methods that utilize field instrumentation to determine a <b>leak.</b> <b>Leak</b> <b>detection</b> <b>systems,</b> or LDS, are generally used in pipeline networks and assist pipeline controllers to detect and localize leaks. To understand <b>leak</b> <b>detection,</b> an overview of different methods that are used is studied {{as well as an}} explanation between the differences of detecting a leak in a pipe and determining the local area of a leak. This project seeks to focus on water <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> <b>systems</b> and to show the importance of finding a leak in a small scale pipe network. The project also seeks to utilize wireless communication to talk between devices while performing these tasks. More specifically, in this project, two custom devices are built to act as a master and slave unit between two water flow meters. Each meter monitors the current flow rate of water passing through the pipe it is located. The master device acts as the ???base??? which simulates the origin of the water while the slave acts as any arbitrary pipe that is located down the pipeline. The device is created utilizing an Arduino Microcontroller and Xbee wireless device, IEEE 802. 15. 4. An LCD screen is also used on each device to display the current flow rate as well as show an alert if a leak is detected. Design details of the system are addressed...|$|R

This thesis evaluates approaches to extend the capabilities of such systems deploying methane sniffers (pinpoint sensors) in locating the leakage sources by combining their sensory information with advanced data analytics. It will assess the potential role of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in improving the accuracy of leak source identification of permanently installed subsea <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> <b>systems.</b> The study reviews {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} four different modeling techniques that have been chosen to support this task: the analytical approach, the optimization approach, the probabilistic approach and the direct inverse approach. In the evaluation phase, the optimization approach, which underlies the working principles of artificial neural networks, was identified as the approach providing the highest accuracy, shortest time to run and with the lightest demands on resources in order to identify the location of methane leakage source in subsea condition. In addition, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) module is also introduced to generate the data that is essential for the ANN training and testing process. This thesis contains five main experiments. The first experiment provides the use of CFD to simulate different methane leakage source locations and its area of dispersion in steady state.
