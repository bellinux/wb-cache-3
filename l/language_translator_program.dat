40|$|A {{rule based}} {{transformational}} model for program development and a meta-tool {{based on the}} above model is presented. The meta-tool can be instantiated to create various program development tools such as tools for building reusable software components, language directed editors, <b>language</b> to <b>language</b> <b>translators,</b> <b>program</b> instrumentation, structured document generator, and adaptive language based prettyprinters. This new rule based approach has two important features: 1) it is language independent and {{can be applied to}} various languages, and 2) provides a powerful escape mechanism for extending the semantics of the rules. Instances of the meta-tool for restructuring source programs for building ab-stract components and their refinement to concrete instances, source-to-source trans-lation, and source contraction and expansion tools for improving readability and understanding are described...|$|R

50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 1950s, Hamblin worked with the third {{computer}} available in Australia, a DEUCE computer manufactured by the English Electric Company. For the DEUCE, he designed one of the first programming languages, later called GEORGE, which was based on Reverse Polish Notation. His associated compiler (<b>language</b> <b>translator)</b> translated the <b>programs</b> formulated in GEORGE into the machine language of the computer, in 1957.|$|R
50|$|Apart from naming differences, {{and despite}} a certain {{discrepancy}} in basic register structure, the Z80 and 8086 syntax are virtually isomorphic {{for a large}} portion of instructions. Only quite superficial similarities (such as the word MOV, or the letter X, for extended register) exist between the 8080 and 8086 assembly languages, although 8080 programs can be assembled into 8086 object code using a special assembler or translated to 8086 assembly <b>language</b> by a <b>translator</b> <b>program.</b>|$|R
40|$|Although, many {{scientists}} and engineers use Octave or MATLAB as their preferred programming language, dynamic nature of these languages can lead to slower running-time of programs written in these languages compared to programs written in languages which are not as dynamic, like C, C++ and Fortran. In this work we developed a translator for a new programming language (tym) which tries to address performance issues, common in scientific programs, by adding new constructs to a subset of Octave/MATLAB <b>language.</b> Our <b>translator</b> compiles <b>programs</b> written in tym, to efficient C++ code.

40|$|Parse Tree Notation (PTN) {{facilitates}} the encoding of <b>language</b> <b>translators</b> which transform <b>programs</b> written {{in high level}} languages with extensions (e. g. a logic language with object oriented features) into equivalent programs in the original unextended languages (e. g. Prolog). PTN does this by offering a small set of operations and built-in predicates for manipulating program parse trees. More complicated actions can be readily coded by combining PTN with Prolog predicates. The main PTN operation augments unification with pattern matching capabilities based on the Definite Clause Grammar (DCG) for {{the language of the}} program being manipulated. This allows parse tree searches to be specified, based on the terminal and nonterminal types of the language, without the programmer having to augment the DCG or to write specialised tree manipulation predicates...|$|R

50|$|It was {{noticed that}} an {{unexpected}} number of shaders are not hand-written but generated.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design, development and field {{evaluation of a}} machine translation system from Spanish to Spanish Sign Language (LSE: Lengua de Signos Española). The developed system focuses on helping Deaf people {{when they want to}} renew their Driver’s License. The system is made up of a speech recognizer (for decoding the spoken utterance into a word sequence), a natural <b>language</b> <b>translator</b> (for converting a word sequence into a sequence of signs belonging to the sign language), and a 3 D avatar animation module (for playing back the signs). For the natural <b>language</b> <b>translator,</b> three technological approaches have been implemented and evaluated: an example-based strategy, a rule-based translation method and a statistical translator. For the final version, the implemented <b>language</b> <b>translator</b> combines all the alternatives into a hierarchical structure. This paper includes {{a detailed description of the}} field evaluation. This evaluation was carried out in the Local Traffic Office in Toledo involving real government employees and Deaf people. The evaluation includes objective measurements from the system and subjective information from questionnaires.
