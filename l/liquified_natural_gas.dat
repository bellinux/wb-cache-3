40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the value of having the option to buy gas on the world <b>Liquiﬁed</b> <b>Natural</b> Gas-market rather than just relying on one {{distributor}} via pipeline. The world market for <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> is characterized by rigid distribution methods {{and there is no}} short term ﬂexibility of destination for the seller and almost no possibility for buyers to buy gas on a competitive market. The investment is evaluated using real option analysis. The computational method for the valuation is Monte Carlo simulations and pipeline gas prices and Liquid Natural Gas prices will be modelled through stochastic modelling and the prices are assumed to be characterized by mean reversion and price convergence. The model will be developed following Yepes Rodríguez (2008) model of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> price progression. The main conclusion is that he value of investing in a regasiﬁcation facility is found to be positive and that LNG regasiﬁcation facilities a ﬁnancially viable investments to diversify <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> markets...|$|R

25|$|The loss of 30% of the country's {{generating}} capacity led to much greater reliance on <b>liquified</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> and coal. Unusual conservation measures were undertaken.

With a focus on the long run, we employ the Autoregressive Distribution Lag bounds test to cointegration approach to search for the determinants of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> flaring in Nigeria using secondary data from 1984 - 2013. Empirical result identified <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> flaring penalty, crude oil production, <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> price, <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> marketization and lack of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> infrastructure as fundamental determinants of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> flaring in Nigeria.

The key conclusion from this paper is that the implementation of policies targeting optimal <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> flaring can result in <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> flaring mitigation in the long run and put Nigeria on the path towards meeting the 2030 World Bank deadline on cessation of routine <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> flaring...|$|R
25|$|A final consideration, {{especially}} for the Great Plains Project, {{was the use of}} methane for fuel instead of jet fuel. Due to aerodynamic control considerations, the fuselage of the RC-1 had to be very large, yet carried almost nothing. This left enormous room for fuel tankage, and the use of methane, hydrogen, or other lightweight fuels was a natural consideration. As the Canadian group was also interested in using the RC-1 to haul <b>liquified</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas,</b> using this as the fuel for the aircraft (natural gas is mostly methane) was an obvious choice. Methane burns much cleaner than jet fuel, and would greatly extend the engine life while also reducing the need for maintenance. It would also eliminate the need to fly fuel to the northern sites, they could simply generate their fuel in-place.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{abundance}} of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in the United States {{because of the}} number of existing <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> reserves and the recent advances in extracting unconventional reserves has been one of the main drivers for low <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> prices. A question arises of what is the optimal use of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> as a transportation fuel. Is it more efficient to use <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in a stationary power application to generate electricity to charge electric vehicles, compress <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> for onboard combustion in vehicles, or re-form <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> into a denser transportation fuel? This study investigates the well-to-wheels energy use and greenhouse gas emissions from various <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> to transportation fuel pathways and compares the results to conventional gasoline vehicles and electric vehicles using the US electrical generation mix. Specifically, <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> vehicles running on compressed <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> are compared against electric vehicles charged with electricity produced solely from <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> combustion in stationary power plants. The results of the study show that the dependency on the combustion efficiency of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in stationary power can outweigh the inherent efficiency of electric vehicles, thus highlighting the importance of examining energy use on a well-to-wheels basis...|$|R

40|$|China {{has become}} a net {{importer}} of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> {{as a result of}} rapidly increasing consumption in recent years. A production peak would exist since <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> is an exhaustible resource. As conventional <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> production peak approaches, the development of unconventional <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> is attracting increasing attention. China's unconventional <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> reserves are abundant, but exploration {{is still in its infancy}} stage. Thus, with the increasing quest for low-carbon development and China's <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> price reform, studying the impacts of unconventional gas development on China's <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> supply and price reform under different scenarios has practical significance. In this paper we predict China's <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> production trends in different scenarios and forecast <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> demand.
