40|$|Prolific vacancy in Philadelphia’s built {{environment}} {{is a major}} challenge as the city enjoys a resurgence in population and development. The creation of the Philadelphia <b>Land</b> <b>Bank</b> is widely seen as a necessary and useful tool to address the productive reuse of vacant properties. Preservation, however, is not {{a component of the}} <b>land</b> <b>bank’s</b> policies and procedures. This thesis asserts that the goals of the <b>land</b> <b>bank</b> are actually well aligned with those of preservation.

Through arguments linking <b>land</b> <b>banking</b> to sustainability, economic viability, and cultural heritage, this thesis makes the claim for preservation to positively impact the approximately 32, 000 vacant properties that are spread throughout Philadelphia. By exploring partnerships across the country that other <b>land</b> <b>banks</b> have with <b>local</b> preservation organizations, case studies are presented on which to base recommendations for the Philadelphia <b>Land</b> <b>Bank</b> to offer creative solutions to the challenge of problem properties and too few citizen-led opportunities to revitalize the city...|$|R

40|$|Chinese {{cities have}} been {{experiencing}} significant growth and profound socioeconomic transition since late 1970 ’s. Reform and development on institution arrangement for land, {{which is one}} of the basic production elements, have been the core issue for the strategies of establishing market economy and urbanization. <b>Land</b> <b>banking</b> was a mechanism initiated in western European cities for directing urban development in early 1900 ’s. Under this mechanism land is resumed by public authorized organizations and will be held for future use to implement public land use policies. Some Chinese cities began their own <b>land</b> <b>banking</b> operation in the 1990 ’s. After nearly 20 years of introduction of <b>land</b> <b>banking</b> mechanism to China most of the cities and counties are now practicing this mechanism in their land management and supply framework. This study attempts to explore <b>land</b> <b>banking</b> mechanism and its effects on urban development comprehensively in lights of theories of new institutional economics and urban spatial structure applying the diachronic public policy analytical framework. Guangzhou, the third largest city and the first city to practice <b>land</b> <b>banking</b> mechanism, is taken as the study area. Spatial data for land supply records since introduction of <b>land</b> <b>banking</b> mechanism are collected and processed with GIS software. Archives in Guangzhou Construction Archive covering the land development and planning administration in Guangzhou were studied to facilitate in-depth understanding of the mechanism. Related statistics data, regulations, planning proposals, internal reports and were obtained to facilitate this study. Review on evolution of <b>land</b> <b>banking</b> mechanism in China and comparison of related regulations at state and local levels argue that the introduction of <b>land</b> <b>banking</b> mechanism into China has lead to institutional changes in the land development process by integrating western experience and local characteristics. Applying empirical transaction costs analysis on institutional models of major land supply mechanisms in China, this research illustrated that <b>land</b> <b>banking</b> mechanism has resulted in re-distribution of transaction costs of the land supply process, which reduces the transaction costs from the perspective land use right (LUR) users. However, for a specific case of land supply, overall transaction costs would increase under <b>land</b> <b>banking</b> mechanism compared to other land supply mechanisms. Exploration on data collected through GIS analysis illustrated that <b>land</b> <b>banking</b> mechanism strengthens city government’s capacity to instruct changes in both macro level urban form and micro level built environment. Analysis on statistics data and budgetary reports of Guangzhou Municipal Government demonstrates that with <b>land</b> <b>banking</b> mechanism gains of LUR conveyance are providing supplement income for the city government, which is approximately 30 % of the traditional tax-based fiscal income. Financing values of Guangzhou city’s <b>land</b> <b>bank</b> are developed by <b>land</b> <b>banking</b> loans and establishment of the urban development financing platform. Supplement fiscal income and financing values of <b>land</b> <b>banking</b> greatly improve <b>local</b> governments’ leading role in urbanization process mainly through investment on urban infrastructures. Case study on evolution of Liede village under <b>land</b> <b>banking</b> mechanism illustrates that different land development process and changes of urban form have also lead to rearrangement of socio spatial structure such as significant changes in residential spatial changes. published_or_final_versionUrban Planning and DesignDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|The {{story behind}} the {{litigation}} that produced two decisions in Southern Burlington County NAACP v. Township of Mount Laurel may accurately be told in terms of plans having gone awry. The New Jersey Supreme Court invalidated the two attempts by Mount Laurel to regulate land through the implementation of fiscal zoning ordinances. In its most recent decision, Mount Laurel II, the court imposed upon communities a state constitutional obligation to provide adequate housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income families. Mount Laurel II thus defines the constitutional limitations on a municipality 2 ̆ 7 s power to regulate land. It also establishes a supporting corollary: {{in order to fulfill}} this constitutional obligation, a municipality must plan for the growth of its low- and moderate-income population by providing adequate housing opportunities for this population. This Article presents an alternative land use regulation, a municipal <b>land</b> <b>bank,</b> as a means to aid municipalities in planning for and providing housing opportunities for its low- and moderate-income families. Municipal <b>land</b> <b>banks</b> acquire, manage, and dispose of land according to legislatively authorized policies and objectives, and can help ensure that sufficient land is available to provide for a municipality 2 ̆ 7 s supply of fair share housing. In addition, a municipal <b>land</b> <b>bank</b> would shift the responsibility of designing affirmative measures to attack exclusionary zoning practices from the judiciary to the legislature. The Article presents a policy overview of legislation and planning regulations necessary for the establishment of <b>land</b> <b>banks,</b> as well as the interrelationship between the local governmental body an the state and regional agencies that will oversee the operation. Part II focuses on the Mount Laurel doctrine through an examination of Mount Laurel I and Mount Laurel II. The section concludes that the establishment of a municipal <b>land</b> <b>bank</b> would better serve the Mount Laurel doctrine than the remedy proposed by the court in Mount Laurel II. Part III introduces the concept of <b>land</b> <b>banking,</b> and provides a description of its operation and its implementation in foreign countries. The American Law Institute 2 ̆ 7 s study of <b>land</b> <b>banking</b> is also considered. Part IV discusses the legal issues surrounding the <b>land</b> <b>banking</b> concept: the constitutionality of the acquisition of property, the requirement that the <b>land</b> <b>banking</b> objectives benefit the general welfare of the public, and judicial review of land dispositions. Finally, Part V considers issues related to the operation of the <b>land</b> <b>bank,</b> including the legislation necessary to establish entities to oversee the <b>land</b> <b>bank,</b> as well as local development plans...|$|R

40|$|This {{essay is}} based on my closing {{presentation}} at the Washburn Law Journal 2 ̆ 7 s 2015 symposium entitled “The Future of Housing [...] Equity, Stability and Sustainability. ” It explores how <b>land</b> <b>banks</b> and <b>land</b> trusts promote social goods, including socioeconomic integration, by connecting with and shielding against, respectively, market forces. Both engage in stewardship of <b>land.</b> <b>Land</b> <b>banks</b> take temporary ownership of vacant, abandoned properties {{in order to make}} them available for productive use. Land trusts hold land indefinitely to ensure a social purpose is met. Community land trusts hold land for a purpose that is responsive to the human environment, often permanently affordable housing in areas where affordable housing is rare to nonexistent. <b>Land</b> <b>banks</b> encourage people with choices to move into neighborhoods beset by abandonment and poverty. Community land trusts allow lower-income residents to become long-term members of neighborhoods otherwise inaccessible to them. <b>Land</b> <b>banks</b> reduce transaction costs to get the market moving. Land trusts increase transaction costs in order to protect affordable housing and other public goods against elimination by market-driven transfers. The use by these two publicly minded real estate market interventions of opposing tools in starkly different types of neighborhoods raises the following questions: First, do they meet somewhere in the middle? Second, does sustaining neighborhoods of choice hinge on the handoff of some critical mass of real property from <b>land</b> <b>banks</b> to <b>land</b> trusts? The answers to these both questions are negative, if we focus our attention solely on the work done directly by <b>land</b> <b>banks</b> and <b>land</b> trusts. The neighborhoods that warrant the housing stewardship activity of land trusts are just too different from those needing the help of <b>land</b> <b>banks</b> to talk of a continuum of care between the two poles of community land resource control. But, if <b>land</b> <b>banking</b> and its conceptual counterpart, “land trusting”, are thought of more broadly as the strategic adjustment of transaction costs for the promotion of social goods, such as residential socioeconomic integration, then an array of intermediate possibilities present themselves. The essay begins with a brief examination of the importance of residential socioeconomic integration and how it might be advanced appropriately. After looking at some misconceptions about the market’s role in segregating neighborhoods by class, I then explore how <b>land</b> <b>banks</b> and <b>land</b> trusts intervene to move neighborhoods toward a healthy diversity. The essay concludes with a discussion of <b>land</b> <b>banking</b> and, particularly, <b>land</b> trusting as alternatives to formal stewardship that nevertheless also foster the needed diversity of housing types, land tenure types, and ultimately, resident socioeconomic status to sustain neighborhoods of choice...|$|R
