50|$|Arthur Miller’s {{second major}} play (after No Villain) The Man Who Had All the <b>Luck</b> <b>follows</b> protagonist David Beeves’ existential {{exploration}} into the enigmatic {{question of how}} fate and the human will interact with each other. The play takes on a fantastical, parable-like architecture in its plot construction and character development as we follow Beeves into {{three and a half}} of the luckiest years of his life. The story begins during an evening in April at an undisclosed Midwestern town, evoking a feel of nostalgia and Americana in the process. David Beeves works as a self-taught auto mechanic in a barn that doubles as a repair station - this is where the entire first act takes place. The scene unfolds as David tells J.B., a local shop owner, that he plans to confront his girlfriend Hester’s father about their intention to marry. This, of course, is not as easy as it seems; her father, Andrew Falk, has resented David for over seven years and still controls every aspect of Hester’s life. After receiving conflicting advice on how to mediate the situation from J.B., Hester, his father Pat, and Shory (a disabled veteran who manages the feed and grain store adjacent to the barn), a rich farm owner named Dan Dibble brings his Marmon over for repair after a competing mechanic informs him that the engine will have to be taken apart. J.B. then notes to David in secrecy that getting the Marmon to run properly might cement his place in the tractor business, despite David’s lack of prowess in tractor repair. David agrees to the job with brisk charm, though is filled with doubt about his ability to diagnose the Marmon properly.|$|E

NW, Zadie Smith, p. 275 Hard luck rules {{and so we}} neither deserve {{condemnation}} nor praise for our choices and actions. Although this is the central and deeply revisionary message of Neil Levy’s recent book, he also suggests that the message is not as bleak as it may seem. According to Levy, the hard luck account also ensures {{that there are no}} desert-entail-ing differences between agents and so paves the way for treating everyone fairly and equally (I will have more to say about this in a bit). While the luck objection has been pressed against libertarians for some time (see, e. g. Mele 2006), Levy {{is one of the first}} to develop an account of luck within the free will debate that is systematically employed to undermine a variety of different accounts of free will and moral responsibility, including, libertarianism (Ch. 3) ...|$|E

She also displays a manipulative side, as she takes advantage of Rowley's innocence and childlike behavior and subtly forces Rowley to think the same way SHE thinks, as well as being responsible for his change of appearance. Greg describes this as if Rowley doesn't own opinions anymore. This is an irritant for Greg throughout the book. She is also shallow, as she harshly dumps Rowley in favor of her former boyfriend, Michael. It is later revealed that she only went out with Rowley in order to make Michael jealous.|$|R
