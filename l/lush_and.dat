5|$|After {{exploring}} {{a number of}} the game's locations, the apprentice gains access to a guarded tunnel and is astonished to discover what lies on the other side. Whereas the valley where Drypeak is located is a dustbowl devoid of vegetation, the lands {{on the other side of}} the tunnel are <b>lush</b> <b>and</b> green, meaning highly illegal shaping is taking place in secret. Serviles, the Shapers' slaves created from life essence, show abnormal intelligence and self-awareness. While still reeling from the revelation of what lies beyond Drypeak, the Shaper apprentice discovers that Shanti has disappeared during one of her escapes from her armed escorts, her necklace lay broken on the grass outside the tunnel. At this point, approximately a quarter of the way through the game, the player's choices expand considerably.|$|E
5|$|Late Registration is {{the second}} studio album by American hip hop {{producer}} and rapper Kanye West. It was recorded {{over the course of}} a year in sessions held across studios in New York City and Hollywood, with West collaborating with American record producer and composer Jon Brion. The album features guest contributions from Adam Levine, Lupe Fiasco, Jamie Foxx, Common, Jay-Z, Brandy, and Nas, among others. Its production was notably more <b>lush</b> <b>and</b> elaborate than West's 2004 debut album The College Dropout, as he utilized intricate sampling methods and string orchestration with Brion. West's lyrics explore both personal and political themes, including poverty, drug trafficking, racism, healthcare, and the blood diamond trade.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, Sauvignon blanc {{wines from}} the {{maritime}} climatic regions of New Zealand, particularly the South Island, became popular on the wine market. In the Marlborough Region, sandy soils over slate shingles {{have become the}} most desirable locations for plantings due to the good drainage of the soil and poor fertility that encourages the vine to concentrate its flavors in lower yields. In the flood plain of the Wairau River Valley, the soil runs in east-west bands across the area. This can create a wide diversity of flavors for vineyards that are planted north-south with the heavier soils producing more herbaceous wines from grapes that ripen late and vines planted in stonier soils ripening earlier and imparting more <b>lush</b> <b>and</b> tropical flavors. It is this difference in soils, {{and the types of}} harvest time decisions that wine producers must make, that add a unique element to New Zealand Sauvignon blanc.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{thirteen}} no-hitters pitched by Phillies players, three have been {{won by a}} score of 6–0, and three by a score of 1–0, more common than any other results. The largest margin of victory in a Phillies no-hitter was ten runs, in a 10–0 win by Chick Fraser. Charlie Ferguson's no-hitter, the first in franchise history, was a 1–0 victory, as {{were two of the}} more recent regular season no-hitters, thrown by Kevin Millwood in 2003 and Roy Halladay in 2010. Three pitchers to throw no-hitters for the Phillies have been left-handed: Johnny Lush (in 1906), Terry Mulholland (in 1990) and Cole Hamels (in 2015). The other eight pitchers were right-handed. Halladay is the only Phillies' pitcher to throw more than one no-hitter in a Phillies uniform, and others, including Hall of Famer Jim Bunning, have pitched more than one in their careers. The longest interval between Phillies no-hitters was between the games pitched by <b>Lush</b> <b>and</b> Bunning, encompassing 58 years, 1 month, and 20 days from May 1, 1906 to June 21, 1964. Conversely, the shortest interval between no-hitters was between Halladay's two 2010 no-hitters, with a total of merely four months and seven days from May 29 to October 6; the shortest gap between regular-season no-hitters was between Mulholland's and Tommy Greene's games (nine months and eight days from August 15, 1990 to May 23, 1991). Two opponents have been no-hit by the Phillies more than one time: the San Francisco Giants, who were defeated by Mulholland (in 1990) and Millwood (in 2003); and the Cincinnati Reds, who were no-hit by Rick Wise (in 1971) and Halladay (in 2010).|$|E

They also reported that IVIG could be an alternative to splenectomy in patients with the chronic form of childhood ITP. However, <b>Lusher</b> <b>and</b> colleagues also recognized that acute ITP in childhood was a self-limited condition, and did not necessarily require pharmacologic treatment.|$|R

25|$|Early {{works were}} {{composed}} using simple schema such as flags, maps, targets, letters and numbers. Johns' {{treatment of the}} surface is often <b>lush</b> <b>and</b> painterly; he is famous for incorporating such media as encaustic and plaster relief in his paintings. Johns played with and presented opposites, contradictions, paradoxes, and ironies, much like Marcel Duchamp (who {{was associated with the}} Dada movement). Johns also produces intaglio prints, sculptures and lithographs with similar motifs.|$|E
25|$|Larger scale works {{included}} his orchestral piece Iberia (1907), a triptych {{medley of}} Spanish allusions and fleeting impressions which was begun {{as a work}} for two pianos, and also the music for Gabriele D'Annunzio's mystery play Le Martyre de saint Sébastien (1911). A <b>lush</b> <b>and</b> dramatic work, written in only two months, it is remarkable in sustaining a late antique modal atmosphere that was otherwise touched only in relatively short piano pieces.|$|E
25|$|In {{the more}} <b>lush</b> <b>and</b> green {{north of the}} island the main {{development}} for tourism {{has been in the}} town of Puerto de la Cruz. The town itself has kept some of its old-harbour town charm mixed with northern European influences. Still, the tourist boom in the 1960s changed the outlook of the town, making it cosy and cosmopolitan at the same time, and a favourite for the more mature traveller (notably the German and Spanish tourist).|$|E

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Jason Ankeny noted: [...] "the precise raison d'être behind {{the album is}} a mystery, but it's {{nevertheless}} a charmer, boasting some of Pete Rugolo's <b>lushest</b> <b>and</b> loveliest arrangements ... wry, cool-toned jazz melodies heavy on innuendo and late-night appeal. Whatever the notion behind the session, the execution's delightful".|$|R

25|$|Lieutenant Bowen's {{settlement}} at Risdon Cove {{had been}} poorly sited. He had chosen {{it based on}} the advice of an earlier expedition, that had found the creek at Risdon swollen with fresh water. Bowen's contingent had arrived on 11 September 1803 at the end of what was probably a wet winter. The grassy woodlands around Risdon Cove were verdant and <b>lush,</b> <b>and</b> the creek was at full flow. However, after a long hot summer between December 1803 and February 1804, during which the Risdon Cove encampment received not a single day of rain whatsoever, the creek was dried up completely and the grass and woodlands parched.|$|E

25|$|A {{package of}} 5 gum {{contains}} 15 sticks of gum in the United States and Canada, and 12 in Europe and Australia. It is a slim packet with three rows of five in North America, or three rows of four in other countries. Ingredients, nutrition facts, and {{description of the}} flavor aren't {{on the outside of}} the box (except for the European versions), instead they are printed on the outer plastic wrap, to keep the box itself simple. The flavor description is printed on the inside of the front flap of the box. The foil that the gum is wrapped in is glossy and covered with 5 logos. The wrappers all match the color of the gum inside (except for the American Prism flavor, which has a lime green wrapper with red-orange gum). The original 5 gum variety pack contained three packs of Rain, Cobalt, <b>Lush</b> <b>and</b> Elixir. A new variety pack was introduced in fall 2009 containing the flavors Rain, Cobalt, Solstice and Zing, and another with three packs of Cobalt, Rain, Solstice, and Elixir. The pack has a Tidy Man logo, which is a human figure in the shape of the 5 logo.|$|E

Cukor biographer and film critic Emanuel Levy praised the strong atmosphere of Keeper of the Flame and Cukor's [...] "interesting Gothic style". Other historians have pointed out that the film's score is particularly good. For example, one review noted that the music goes silent during the climactic scene in which Katharine Hepburn reveals her secrets to Spencer Tracy—an effective and unexpected emotional tactic.|$|E

500|$|My Bloody Valentine are {{regarded}} as the pioneers of the alternative rock subgenre known as shoegazing, a term coined by Sounds journalists in the late 1980s to describe certain bands' [...] "motionless performing style, where they stood on stage {{and stared at the}} floor". The band's releases on Creation Records influenced other shoegazing acts, including Slowdive, Ride and <b>Lush,</b> <b>and</b> {{are regarded}} as providing a platform to allow the bands to become recognised. Following the release of Loveless (1991), My Bloody Valentine were [...] "poised for a popular breakthrough", although never achieved mainstream success. However, the band are noted to have been [...] "profoundly influential in the direction of '90s alternative rock", according to AllMusic.
