5|$|In Southeast Asia the {{continental}} area (Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam) generally practices Theravada Buddhism. Most of insular Southeast Asia (namely Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia) practices mostly Sunni Islam. The {{rest of the}} insular region (Philippines and East Timor) practices mostly Roman Catholic Christianity and Singapore practises mostly Mahayana Buddhism. Significant long-distance labor migration {{that occurred during the}} late 19th into the early 20th century provided many different types of ethnic diversity. Relations between the indigenous population of the region arose from regional variations of cultural and <b>linguistic</b> <b>group.</b> During this time immigrant minorities, especially the Chinese, developed as well. Although there were extreme political differences for each minority and religion, they were still legitimate members of political communities {{and there has been a}} significant amount of unity throughout history. This differs from both nearby East and South Asia.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} is young and predominantly rural, with a density {{among the highest}} in Africa. Rwandans are drawn from just one cultural and <b>linguistic</b> <b>group,</b> the Banyarwanda, although within this group there are three subgroups: the Hutu, Tutsi and Twa. The Twa are a forest-dwelling pygmy people descended from Rwanda's earliest inhabitants. Scholars disagree on the origins of and differences between the Hutu and Tutsi; some believe differences are derived from former social castes within a single people, while others believe the Hutu and Tutsi arrived in the country separately, and from different locations. Christianity is the largest religion in the country; the principal language is Kinyarwanda, spoken by most Rwandans, with English and French serving as official languages. Rwanda has a presidential system of government. The president is Paul Kagame of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), who took office in 2000. Rwanda today has low corruption compared with neighbouring countries, although human rights organisations report suppression of opposition groups, intimidation and restrictions on freedom of speech. The country has been governed by an ordered administrative hierarchy since pre-colonial times; there are five provinces delineated by borders drawn in 2006. Rwanda is one of only two countries with a female majority in the national parliament.|$|E
25|$|The French Community and the Flemish Community {{exercise}} their powers in Brussels through two community-specific public authorities: the French Community Commission (French: Commission communautaire française or COCOF) and the Flemish Community Commission (Dutch: Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie or VGC). These two bodies each have an assembly {{composed of the}} members of each <b>linguistic</b> <b>group</b> of the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of human <b>linguistic</b> <b>groups</b> presents {{a number of}} interesting and nontrivial patterns. The distributions {{of the number of}} speakers per language and the area each group covers follow log-normal distributions, while population and area fulfill an allometric relationship. The topology of networks of spatial contacts between different <b>linguistic</b> <b>groups</b> has been recently characterized, showing atypical properties of the degree distribution and clustering, among others. Human demography, spatial conflicts, and the construction of networks of contacts between <b>linguistic</b> <b>groups</b> are mutually dependent processes. Here we introduce an adaptive network model that takes all of them into account and successfully reproduces, using only four model parameters, not only those features of <b>linguistic</b> <b>groups</b> already described in the literature, but also correlations between demographic and topological properties uncovered in this work. Besides their relevance when modeling and understanding processes related to human biogeography, our adaptive network model admits a number of generalizations that broaden its scope and make it suitable to represent interactions between agents based on population dynamics and competition for space...|$|R

25|$|The {{issue of}} {{proportional}} hiring {{and promotion of}} speakers of both official languages has been an issue in Canadian politics since before Confederation. Members of each <b>linguistic</b> <b>group</b> have complained of injustice when their group have been represented, in public service hiring and promotion, in numbers less than would be justified by their proportion of the national population. For {{the greater part of}} Canada’s history, French-speakers were underrepresented, and English-speakers were overrepresented in the ranks of the public service, and the disproportion became more pronounced in the more senior ranks of public servants. However, this trend has reversed itself in recent decades.|$|E
25|$|A {{political}} stalemate {{between the}} French- and English-speaking legislators, {{as well as}} fear of aggression from the United States during the American Civil War, led the political elite to hold a series of conferences in the 1860s to effect a broader federal union of all British North American colonies. The British North America Act took effect on July 1, 1867, establishing the Dominion of Canada, initially with four provinces: Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario. The Province of Canada was divided at this point into Ontario and Quebec so that each major European <b>linguistic</b> <b>group</b> would have its own province.|$|E
25|$|The Coast Miwok spoke {{their own}} Coast Miwok {{language}} in the Utian <b>linguistic</b> <b>group.</b> They lived by hunting and gathering, and lived in small bands without centralized political authority. In the springtime they would head to the coasts to hunt salmon and other seafood, including seaweed. Otherwise their staple foods were primarily acorns—particularly from black and tan oak–nuts and wild game, such as deer and cottontail rabbits and black-tailed deer, Odocoileus hemionus columbianus, a coastal subspecies of the California mule deer, Odocoileus hemionus. When hunting deer, Miwok hunters traditionally used Brewer's angelica, Angelica breweri to eliminate their own scent. Miwok did not typically hunt bears. Yerba buena tea leaf were used medicinally.|$|E
