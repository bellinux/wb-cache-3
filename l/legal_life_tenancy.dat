50|$|A further {{limitation}} {{is the rule}} against perpetuities in many states and countries which prohibits long-running pre-19th-century style successions of <b>life</b> <b>tenancies</b> and may result in the premature and compensation-entitling termination of such successive life interests. In England and Wales this is fixed at one lifetime, or 80 years whichever is longer.|$|R

50|$|In 1370 Eric III succeeded Albert V as Duke of Saxe-Bergedorf-Mölln, {{a highly}} indebted branch duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg. So he pawned - {{in return for}} 16,262.5 Lübeck marks - all the {{remaining}} unencumbered parts of his branch duchy, to wit the Herrschaft of Bergedorf, the Vierlande, his half of the Saxon Wood and Geesthacht, to Lübeck.

50|$|It {{appears that}} Clinton's land-holding {{must have been}} {{primarily}} <b>life</b> <b>tenancies</b> since his descendants' property was not nearly so great. His son and successor, also named Geoffrey, became engaged in a violent quarrel with the Earl of Warwick early in the reign of King Stephen of England. The Clintons nearly lost everything, {{but in the end}} a settlement was reached (probably in the summer of 1138) by which the younger Geoffrey de Clinton married Warwick's daughter Agnes.|$|R
50|$|JB and George Fry {{worked as}} a plumber and laundryman, earning £1 a week. But they had the {{reversion}} of their Uncle’s estate, subject to the <b>life</b> <b>tenancy</b> of their Aunt.

50|$|In later life, Lady Desmond was {{party to}} a {{property}} dispute typical of late-Tudor Ireland (1485-1603). Her husband had granted her a <b>life</b> <b>tenancy</b> in Inchiquin Castle, about 5 {{miles southwest of}} the town of Youghal, in Munster. Upon the Countess Desmond's death the castle was to revert to the line of the Earls of Desmond.

However, the agreement with the Society granted <b>life</b> <b>tenancy</b> to the Countess Szapary.

50|$|Coole House {{may have}} been damaged in the Irish Civil War (1922-23). Lady Gregory sold the estate to the Irish state in 1927, but {{retained}} <b>life</b> <b>tenancy.</b> She died in 1932 and the furnishings were soon auctioned off. By the 1960s the state had allowed the Gregorys' former house to fall into a ruin, a neglect deplored by Micheál Mac Liammóir in 1964. Indeed, according to the National Archives, the building was actively demolished by the state in 1941. Today, all that remains is the plinth on which it stood.|$|R

It {{is shown in the}} 1825 city plan, as well as in a list of Armenian churches in Tbilisi written on 16 December 1831. Historians prefer to date its construction {{to the start of the}} 19th century. According to Irakliy II gift deed, [...] "in 1795 the state village Chugureti with the local inhabitants and lands given to Karapet and Georgiy, children of Sargis-agha (Amatuni) for <b>life</b> <b>tenancy</b> and now order ashigh-agha-basha Tamaz Orbelyanov to give the village for life tenancy".|$|R

50|$|Morrison's will {{left the}} estate to Horton Hospital (also {{named after the}} house's first resident) in Middletown, with his wife Christine granted <b>life</b> <b>tenancy.</b> When the founders of Orange County Community College {{approached}} her in the late 1940s, {{she was willing to}} sell, but did not have the legal right since her husband's will had already disposed of the property. The hospital was not willing to sell at that time since it had planned to do so upon Mrs. Morrison's death in the hope of getting the best possible price to pay down its debt. The community raised $480,000 ($ in contemporary dollars) to that end, and the hospital released its claim.|$|R
50|$|Prominent state {{legislator}} and county commissioner Clarence R. Prescott homesteaded here in 1891, planting a vast orchard of plum, cherry, pear, and apple trees. In 1898, Prescott replaced his original log dwelling with this beautiful Queen Anne style residence. The home was patterned after the childhood home of Prescott’s wife Julia, a schoolteacher, {{who had come}} to Montana from Pennsylvania in 1880. Today the Prescott homestead {{is one of the few}} remaining links to the agricultural foundations of Missoula. The property was owned by the family until 1955 when the University of Montana purchased the Prescott acreage. Son Clarence Prescott, Jr., was then granted <b>life</b> <b>tenancy</b> of the house and 1 acre.|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} and analyses how <b>legal</b> <b>life</b> writing {{has grown to}} embrace {{a wider range of}} subjects, sources, and methods – from eminent white male judges to women, minorities, displaced persons, and outsiders – and explains and justifies it as an intellectual project. It considers some of life writing's challenges, shortcomings, and dilemmas, suggesting ways forward. The aim is to advance an important, inter-disciplinary perspective in the making: namely, a more pluralistic, democratic conception of <b>legal</b> <b>life</b> writing, which offers new ways of advancing legal history and socio-legal scholarship, encouraging inter-disciplinary dialogue. It is argued that <b>legal</b> <b>life</b> writing demonstrates the value of historical thinking in comprehending law, politics, and culture; it can also supplement the study of law, helping legal historians and socio-legal scholars to develop new skills and embrace a wider range of participants and audiences, thereby enhancing their ability to engage with public issues and public history...|$|R
50|$|Mr Cooper {{agreed to}} take a lease of a salmon fishery from his uncle at where the Arrow and Owenmore Rivers met, near Ballysadare, Ireland. After the uncle died, the lease was renewed through Mr Cooper’s aunt, via her three daughters, Cooper’s cousins, and Mr Phibbs acting as their agent. The aunt, three sisters, and Mr Cooper, had all assumed that they were {{entitled}} to the land through a right of inheritence. In fact, Cooper was truly entitled to an equitable residual interest, because the uncle in his will had granted Cooper a <b>life</b> <b>tenancy.</b> When the sisters asked for the next rental payment, this had transpired and Mr Cooper sought a declaration {{that he was the}} owner and that the lease was not enforceable.|$|R
5000|$|In 1916, at the {{invitation}} {{of the members of the}} New Zealand branch, and with the offer of <b>life</b> <b>tenancy</b> of “Whare Ra”, Dr Felkin and his family returned to New Zealand for good. He issued a new constitution for the Order of the Stella Matutina in the same year, informing members that the Mother Temple of the Order was now in New Zealand. [...] The Order, governed by three ruling Chiefs, prospered under their leadership. By the time of the death of Dr Felkin in 1926, it had a very active membership and was well established - its membership included two Anglican Bishops, General Sir Arthur Russell, Lord Jellicoe, Governor General of New Zealand, members of Parliament, and local dignitaries and officials.|$|R

[...] She was also given the lordship of Holderness which was held after her death by her 3rd husband, Odo, the by then disinherited Count of Champagne; the lordship then passed to their son, Stephen. Adelaide died before 1090.|$|R
