5|$|Earlier, the caracal was {{classified}} under the genera Felis or Lynx. However, a 2006 phylogenetic {{study showed that}} the caracal evolved nearly a million years before the lynx appeared.

50|$|Rodents and shrews {{may enter}} the diet of {{juvenile}} crocodiles, i.e. 1 to 1.5 m, and become commonplace in sub-adult and small adult crocodiles. Species recorded include the Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis), African marsh rat (Dasymys incomtus), common rufous-nosed rat (Oenomys hypoxanthus) and the savanna swamp shrew (Crocidura longipes). In many areas, the cane rats are a particular favorite mammalian food for crocodiles, particularly the relatively large greater cane rat (Thryonomys swinderianus). In Uganda and Zambia, the latter species {{are the leading}} overall mammalian prey type for crocodiles and one Kenyan crocodile of 2.7 m in length had 40 greater cane rats in its stomach.

Small carnivores are readily taken opportunistically including both African clawless (Aonyx capensis) and spotted-necked otters (Hydrictis maculicollis), as well as water mongoose (Atilax paludinosus), African wildcats (Felis silvestris lybica) and <b>servals</b> (<b>Leptailurus</b> <b>serval).</b>|$|R
40|$|The annual and {{seasonal}} diet of the bobcat (Lynx rufus) was determined from analysis of 188 feces in the Cape region of Baja California, Mexico, an arid zone with numerous subtropical elements in its flora and fauna. Bobcats fed mainly on lagomorphs, which reached 74 % of occurrence, followed by rodents (40 %), reptiles (15 %), and birds (12 %). No seasonal variations were observed. The results {{were consistent with}} those of studies elsewhere, indicating that bobcats still rely upon lagomorphs for much of their food in southern latitudes. This supports the hypothesis that lynx have evolved to prey on hares and rabbits. The prevalence of reptiles as prey of bobcats in our study area was the highest ever reported. They were reported as bobcat prey in only 1 of 20 studies from north of latitude 40 °, but in 14 of the 18 studies carried out south of this latitude.

40|$|The {{increasing}} interest on respiratory nematodes of domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) has recently stimulated several studies on their epidemiology and geographic distribution. At the same time, {{there are still}} important gaps in {{our knowledge of the}} infections caused by respiratory nematodes in wild felids. The present study investigated the occurrence of pulmonary parasites in wild hosts housed in sanctuaries and protected areas of South Africa. Faecal samples collected from seven species of wild felids living in three study sites were copromicroscopically and genetically examined. Of twenty-one samples six, i. e. three from caracals (Caracal caracal), two from lions (Panthera leo) and one <b>from</b> a <b>serval</b> (<b>Leptailurus</b> <b>serval),</b> scored positive for the metastrongyloid Aelurostrongylus abstrusus at copromicroscopic and/or molecular tests. No other lungworms were recorded. The occurrence of the cosmopolitan cat lungworm A. abstrusus in wild hosts has been so far questioned. Importantly, the present findings represent an unequivocal evidence of the capability of A. abstrusus to infect some species of wild felids. Further studies are warranted to understand the epidemiological patterns of lungworms in wild and domestic felids, and to better investigate the impact of these parasitoses on health and welfare of wild animals...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{assessment}} of carnivore population status is frequently hindered by insufficient distribution data. For northern South Africa we address this deficit by mapping new records from landscape-scale sign surveys, questionnaire interviews, problem animal records and camera trapping. The black-backed jackal Canis mesomelas and caracal Caracal caracal remain common and widespread. Ranges of the <b>serval</b> <b>Leptailurus</b> <b>serval</b> and brown hyaena Hyaena brunnea were {{much larger than}} previous estimates, {{reducing the risk of}} simultaneous extirpation across all occupied locations. The proportion of range area occupied was larger for several species, notably the leopard Panthera pardus, cheetah Acinonyx jubatus and serval. We conclude that the serval continues to recover from historical threats and is expanding into new areas. A larger brown hyaena range and less fragmented pattern of occurrence probably confers greater resilience to threats than was suggested by previous data. Reduced extinction risk arising from the increased area occupied by the cheetah and leopard is tempered by probable local range contraction. Our maps provide baseline information for monitoring the distribution of these six species, which is essential in managing ecological issues that have a spatial component such as responses to changing land use. Our results also demonstrate the utility of detection/nondetection surveys in rapid {{assessment of}} carnivore populations at large spatial scales. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. As {{protected}} areas ultimately aim to successfully conserve natural predator populations, {{an understanding of}} the non-anthropogenic drivers of their population change is critical. Both bottom-up (e. g. food limitation, competition) and top-down (e. g. predation, interference) processes {{play an important role in}} structuring predator guilds, yet there is a poor understanding of their relative importance. Here, I investigated whether the relative abundance of mesopredators, facultative scavengers, and an apex predator were affected primarily by bottom-up processes (prey abundance) or by top-down processes (predator abundance), or a combination of the two. Central to this study was elucidating the complex relationship between mesopredators and apex predators. Caracal (Caracal caracal), blackbacked jackal (Canis mesomelas), sidestriped jackal (Canis adustus), honey badger (Mellivora capensis) and <b>serval</b> (<b>Leptailurus</b> <b>serval)</b> were classed together as Mesopredators. Facultative scavengers included two hyaena species (spotted Crocuta crocuta and brownhyaena Hyaena brunnea). Leopards (Panthera pardus) were included as an example of an apex predator. Data was obtained from camera-trap surveys conducted in four {{protected areas}} located in northern KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa). Results of both a nested analysis of variance and generalised linear mixed models revealed that there was no mesopredator suppression present in protected areas with complete predator guild. In addition, prey and similarly sized predator relative abundance indices (RAIs) had a significant positive effect on mesopredator, hyaena and leopard RAI. The findings suggest that bottom-up drivers are more important than top-down processes in determining the relative abundance of mammalian predators in these protected areas. My study highlights the importance of monitoring prey populations in a protected area when attempting to successfully manage mammalian predator trophic guilds...|$|R

To examine whether it was required for wild felids globally, we examined the induction of pluripotency in felids from Asia (Bengal tiger, Pan-thera tigris), Africa (<b>serval,</b> <b>Leptailurus</b> <b>serval),</b> and the Americas (jaguar, Panthera onca). Dermal fibroblasts were transduced with genes encoding the human transcription factors OCT 4, SOX 2, KLF 4, and cMYC with or without NANOG. Both four- and five-factor induction resulted in colony formation at day 3 in all three species tested; however, {{we were not able to}} maintain colonies that were generated without NANOG beyond passage (P) 7. Five-factor induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) colonies from wild cats were expanded in vitro on feeder layers and were positive for alkaline phosphatase and protein expression of OCT- 4, NANOG, and stage-specific embry-onic antigen- 4 at P 4 and P 14. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed that all five human transgenes were transcribed at P 4; however, OCT 4, SOX 2, and NANOG transgenes were silenced by P 14. Endog-enous OCT 4 and NANOG transcripts were detected at P 4 and P 14 in all cell lines confirming successful reprog-ramming. At P 14, the iPSCs from all three species remained euploid and differentiated in vivo and in vitro into derivatives of the three germ layers. This study describes an effective method for inducing pluripotency in three endangered wild cats from across the globe and confirms Nanog as an essential factor in the reprogramming event. Efficient production of iPSC from endangered felids creates a unique opportunity for species preservation through gamete production, nuclear transfer, embryo complementation, and future novel technologies.
