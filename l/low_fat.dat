Once {{the acute}} attack subsides, levels of uric acid can be lowered via lifestyle changes {{and in those}} with frequent attacks, allopurinol or probenecid provides long-term prevention.

5|$|Cowpeas seeds {{provide a}} rich source of {{proteins}} and calories, as well as minerals and vitamins. This complements the mainly cereal diet in countries that grow cowpeas as a major food crop. A seed can consist of 25% protein and has very <b>low</b> <b>fat</b> content. Cowpea starch is digested more slowly than the starch from cereals, which is more beneficial to human health. The grain is {{a rich source}} of folic acid, an important vitamin that helps prevent neural tube defects in unborn babies.|$|E

5|$|In the {{short-term}} low carbohydrate diets appear better than <b>low</b> <b>fat</b> diets for weight loss. In the long term; however, {{all types of}} low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets appear equally beneficial. A 2014 review found that the heart disease and diabetes risks associated with different diets appear to be similar. Promotion of the Mediterranean diets among the obese may {{lower the risk of}} heart disease. Decreased intake of sweet drinks is also related to weight-loss. Success rates of long-term weight loss maintenance with lifestyle changes are low, ranging from 2–20%. Dietary and lifestyle changes are effective in limiting excessive weight gain in pregnancy and improve outcomes for both the mother and the child. Intensive behavioral counseling is recommended in those who are both obese and have other risk factors for heart disease.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the following study were to compare a recently developed <b>low</b> lignin- high <b>fat</b> oat with regular oat as an energy source for use in diets fed to growing-finishing pigs and to compare hammer milling and roller milling as methods of processing oats. A total of 40 crossbred grower pigs (20 barrows and 20 gilts) were {{assigned to one of}} five dietary treatments in a factorial design experiment. The control diet was formulated using barley and soybean meal while four experimental diets were formulated in which 40 % of either normal or <b>low</b> lignin-high <b>fat</b> oat was substituted for barley. The oats were either ground or rolled. Particle size analysis indicated that the average particle size of the grower diets was 884, 1037, 1420, 1031 and 1501 m while for the finisher diets, the average particle size was 800, 869, 1250, 854 and 1098 m for the barley, ground normal oat, rolled normal oat, ground <b>low</b> lignin-high <b>fat</b> oat and rolled <b>low</b> lignin-high <b>fat</b> oat diets respectively. Digestibility coefficients for pigs fed ground oats were significantly (p 0. 05) in nutrient digestibility between pigs fed normal and <b>low</b> lignin-high <b>fat</b> oat. During the growing period (35. 1 to 71. 4 kg) as well as over the entire experiment (35. 1 to 112. 5 kg), there were no differences (p> 0. 05) in daily gain, feed intake or feed conversion between pigs fed normal or <b>low</b> lignin-high <b>fat</b> oat or between pigs fed ground or rolled oat diets. During the finishing period (71. 4 to 112. 5 kg), feed intake and feed conversion were poorer (p< 0. 05) for pigs fed the <b>low</b> lignin-high <b>fat</b> oat compared with the barley diet. There were no differences in carcass traits between pigs fed normal and <b>low</b> lignin-high <b>fat</b> oat or between pigs fed rolled and ground oats. The overall results of this experiment indicate that both normal and <b>low</b> lignin-high <b>fat</b> oat can substitute for barley at levels as high as 40 % of the diet without hindering pig performance. Since the average yield of oat can be equal or higher than barley with lower input costs, a re-examination of feeding recommendations regarding oat in swine rations seems warranted. In addition, since pig performance and carcass traits were not affected by processing method and roller mills have been shown to have lower-energy requirements, lower maintenance costs, quieter operation, and more exact control of particle size than hammer mills, there may be some advantage for pig producers to consider roller mills rather than hammer mills for use in processing pig feeds...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} tested {{the utility of}} an {{extended}} version {{of the theory of}} planned behaviour that included a measure of planning, in the prediction of eating foods <b>low</b> in saturated <b>fats</b> among adults diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease Participants (N = 184) completed questionnaires assessing standard theory of planned behaviour measures (attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control) and the additional volitional variable of planning in relation to eating foods <b>low</b> in saturated <b>fats</b> Self-report consumption of foods <b>low</b> insaturated <b>fats</b> was assessed 1 month later In partial support of the theory of planned behaviour, results indicated that attitude and subjective norm predicted intentions to eat foods <b>low</b> in saturated <b>fats</b> and intentions and perceived behavioural control predicted the consumption of foods <b>low</b> in saturated <b>fats</b> As an additional variable, planning predicted the consumption of foods <b>low</b> in saturated <b>fats</b> directly and also mediated the intention-behaviour and perceived behavioural control-behaviour relationships, suggesting an important role for planning as a post-intentional construct determining healthy eating choices. Suggestions are offered for interventions designed to improve adherence to healthy eating recommendations for people diagnosed with these chronic conditions with a specific emphasis on the steps and activities that are required to promote a healthier lifestyle.

25|$|Moose are hunted {{as a game}} {{species in}} many of the {{countries}} where they are found. Moose meat tastes, wrote Henry David Thoreau in “The Maine Woods”, “like tender beef, with perhaps more flavour; sometimes like veal”.

25|$|A typical {{formulation}} for commercially made mayonnaise (not <b>low</b> <b>fat)</b> {{can contain}} {{as much as}} 80% vegetable oil, usually soybean but sometimes olive oil. Water makes up about 7% to 8% and egg yolks about 6%. Some formulas use whole eggs instead of just yolks. The remaining ingredients include vinegar (4%), salt (1%), and sugar (1%). Low-fat formulas will typically decrease oil content to just 50% and increase water content to about 35%. Egg content is reduced to 4% and vinegar to 3%. Sugar is increased to 1.5% and salt lowered to 0.7%. Gums or thickeners (4%) are added to increase viscosity, improve texture, and ensure a stable emulsion.|$|E

25|$|As Buru {{is located}} at the {{boundary}} between the biogeographic zones of Australia and Asia, its flora and fauna are unique and are the subject of national and international scientific research. Of 25 species of mammals found on the island, at least four are endemic to Buru and closest to it islands. The local species of the wild pig named Buru babirusa (Babyrousa babyrussa) is distinguished from the other Babyrousa species by having relatively long and thick body-hair. It also has very <b>low</b> <b>fat</b> content in their meat (only 1.27% compared to 5–15% for domestic pigs) and is regarded as a delicacy among the local population, which favours it to other wild pigs or deer in terms of texture and flavour.
