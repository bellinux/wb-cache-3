25|$|The Navy studied {{nuclear power}} as a design option for the CG(X), but has never {{announced}} whether it would prefer to build the CG(X) as a nuclear-powered ship - it would have added $600–800M to the initial cost of the ship, but save on running costs. Under normal budgeting practices, long <b>lead-time</b> items for nuclear propulsion would have needed to be procured in FY2009 if the main ship were to be procured in FY2011. If the two-class solution had been pursued, it seems probable that the escort cruiser would have used gas turbines like Zumwalt, and the larger ballistic missile defense ship would have been nuclear powered, and hence known as the CGN(X).|$|E
25|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{consensus}} in the UK about the cost/benefit nature of nuclear energy, as well as ideological influence (for instance, those favouring 'energy security' generally arguing pro, while those worried about the 'environmental impact' against). Because of this, and a lack of a consistent energy policy in the UK since the mid-1990s, no new reactors have been built since Sizewell B in 1995. Costs have been a major influence to this (with Sizewell B having run at a cost of 6p/kWh for its first five years of operation), while the long <b>lead-time</b> between proposal and operation (at ten years or more) has put off many investors, especially with long-term considerations such as energy market regulation and nuclear waste remaining unresolved.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a plan for {{reducing}} <b>lead-times</b> and increasing throughput in a rubber product manufacturing plant by using value stream mapping. The plant produces rubber screening media and wear products used in the mining and aggregate industry that is sold throughout the western hemisphere. A worldwide increase in demand for raw materials has caused sales to increase tremendously for screening and wear media products. The increased workload at the plant has resulted in longer <b>lead-times</b> even though the plant's capacity has not been exceeded. The rubber products manufacturer is inefficient because it produces products in batch quantities and has poor product flow due to operations being departmentalized. The increase in <b>lead-times</b> could cause a loss in the market share to its competitors. The rubber products manufacturer must reduce its <b>lead-times</b> in order to remain competitive and continue its growth by providing quality products in a timely manner. A study will be carried out using value stream mapping to determine areas of potential improvement on the plant floor. A current state map will be developed and analyzed to pin point areas that have potential for improvement. A future state map will then be created to suggest ways to reduce <b>lead-times</b> and increase throughput.

40|$|Part 3 : Knowledge Based Production ManagementInternational audienceFinancial {{management}} {{is concerned with}} the financial evaluation of activities performed in the supply chain. Each activity has implications on the financial situation but the actual cause-effect relation involved in this context is not always obvious. From a return on investment (ROI) perspective the financial measures revenue, cost, and assets, i. e. investment, are identified. Strategic <b>lead-times</b> have been highlighted in the literature as key components for flow design. Strategic <b>lead-times</b> are thereafter further analyzed and the relations between financial measures and strategic <b>lead-times</b> are outlined. Based on these relations, it is possible to establish a relation between financial measures, and decoupling points and decoupling zones. Subsequently this is shown to also provide a reference to supply chain management strategies as they are defined in the literature...|$|R

2500|$|In early 2001, {{the heating}} and {{ventilation}} at Four Seasons Arena was upgraded {{for the first}} time since its construction at a cost of $124,100. Concerned about the stability of the ice at Four Seasons, the city also commissioned a study of both rinks. The study concluded that both rinks needed $1.5 million in repairs and upgrades. But this study was not acted on. [...] The city's management of the facility had also not gone smoothly. Nearly 20 groups which used the facility frequently (hockey teams, exhibitors, rodeo promoters, etc.), but relations between the groups were very poor and various groups accused city managers of playing politics in order to favor one group over another. In June 2001, city managers held an extraordinary day-long meeting of the arena's users in an attempt mediate these differences. This meeting led to a major proposal to upgrade the arena. In August 2001, the various user groups proposed that the city spend $99,000 to purchase a new floor covering for the main ice rink that would reduce the <b>lead-time</b> for transformation of the main arena to just four hours. But this proposal was not acted on. Instead, city managers said the most urgent needs at Four Seasons involved wooded dashers (waist-high walls) around the rink, a new cover for the ice (to keep it cold when not in use), portable bleachers to expand seating, upgrading and replacement of power lines and poles, a new scoreboard, and improvements to make the facility comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act.|$|E
2500|$|A major {{controversy}} over scheduling erupted in November 2011 when Ellerbe proposed that firefighters work a [...] "3-3-3 shift"—three 12-hour days (with nights off), three 12-hour nights (with days off), {{and three days}} off. It was a staffing model used by the D.C. fire department in the 1960s and 1970s, and marked a change from the then-current practice of a single 24-hour shift followed by three days off (known as 24/72). Ellerbe claimed it would reduce staffing costs by $36 million a year after four years, and increase days worked per month to 22 from eight. Because about 40 percent of the city's firefighters lived 30 to 100 miles away, the plan also encouraged firefighters to move closer to Washington, D.C. This would enable the city to recall off-duty firefighters more quickly in an emergency, he said. The union, Local 36, IAFF, strongly opposed the plan. It said firefighters' salaries ($44,300 for a new hire, and $65,500 for a 20-year veteran) were too low to allow firefighters to live {{in or near the}} District of Columbia. The staffing plan would force them to lower their standard of living by moving nearer or into D.C., and deny them the opportunity to work second jobs. The union also said the long <b>lead-time</b> to recall off-duty staff was actually beneficial (since it took the city several hours to get ready during an emergency). It denied the plan would save money, and offered an analysis that showed the change would cost the city $16 million a year.|$|E

The European Project "ESTIMATE", Eurostars Program, is lead to sustain successful ETO processes. The ESTIMATE framework aims at providing guidelines to perform successful ETO product.

40|$|Materials Requirement Planning (MRP) {{technique}} is widely employed by most manufacturing companies, even though field applications point out some weaknesses, including ignored production capacity constraints and fixed <b>lead-times.</b> These weaknesses {{often lead to}} infeasible production schedules, which trigger fluctuating workloads over time, significant adjustment effort and eventually unpredictably long lead times. This paper introduces a capacity-oriented MRP procedure that combines the traditional MRP procedure with an approach based on linear programming: in this way, requirement of lead times pre-determined a priori outside the MRP procedure is overcome. The new procedure is then applied to a real-life company and results highlight that feasible plans of orders are generated without requiring <b>lead-times</b> as input and without relevant computational burden...|$|R

Usually, to prevent a lack of material on-site, costly intermediate storages are used, which extend the delivery time. Well-known approaches in research, like the Last Planner System (LPS) or the Location Based Management System (LBMS), increase collaboration on-site and improve the reliability of construction schedules, but have a limited impact on synchronizing the supply chain to the construction progress. The approach presented in the paper describes how off-site and on-site production can be coupled, to reach short construction <b>lead-Times</b> without wastefully intermediate storages.
