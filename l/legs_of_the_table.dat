60|$|The <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> were {{becoming}} very crooked. Doubledick, {{looking up to}} steady his vision, met the eyes that had so strong an influence over him. He put his hand before his own eyes, and the breast of his disgrace- jacket swelled {{as if it would}} fly asunder.|$|E
60|$|He {{went up to}} it {{and found}} that the gold bottle that {{contained}} the precious powder had dropped upon the stand and scattered its life-giving grains over the machine. The phonograph was very much alive, and began dancing a jig with the <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> to which it was attached, and this dance so annoyed Dr. Pipt that he kicked the thing into a corner and pushed a bench against it, to hold it quiet.|$|E
60|$|He {{struck a}} safety match {{and held it}} to <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|R
50|$|He next {{observed}} a lawyer kill a “viper” which climbed up <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> Devil hums “a hellish song”, comparing {{himself to a}} “yeoman” who surveys his lands contemplating his profits and gains.|$|R
60|$|The cat mewed {{in answer}} and stalked again stiffly round a <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> mewing. Just how she stalks over my writingtable. Prr. Scratch my head. Prr.|$|R
60|$|A steady glare {{from the}} now flameless embers painted {{the sides and}} back of the {{fireplace}} with its colour, and the well-polished andirons, and the old brass tongs that would not meet. The underside of the mantel-shelf was flushed with the high-coloured light, and the <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> nearest the fire. Tess's face and neck reflected the same warmth, which each gem turned into an Aldebaran or a Sirius--a constellation of white, red, and green flashes, that interchanged their hues with her every pulsation.|$|E
60|$|After a while, {{finding that}} nothing more happened, she decided on {{going into the}} garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! {{when she got to}} the door, she found she had {{forgotten}} the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.|$|E
60|$|This {{wonderful}} {{book was}} placed upon a big gold table that {{stood in the}} middle of Glinda's drawing room. The <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> which were incrusted with precious gems, were firmly fastened to the tiled floor, and the book itself was chained to the table and locked with six stout golden padlocks, the keys to which Glinda carried on a chain that was secured around her own neck. The pages of the Great Book were larger in size than those of an American newspaper, and although they were exceedingly thin, there were so many of them that they made an enormous, bulky volume. With its gold cover and gold clasps, the book was so heavy that three men could scarcely have lifted it. Yet this morning when Glinda entered her drawing room after breakfast, the good Sorceress was amazed to discover that her Great Book of Records had mysteriously disappeared.|$|E
6000|$|... "Both, I think, sir. The fit first--I {{have had}} 'em before, and the stroke afterwards--against <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> Anyway they {{finished}} me between them, thanks to that little beast." ...|$|R
50|$|Near the bibloquet {{stands a}} <b>table.</b> On <b>the</b> top, a disembodied hand {{is holding a}} red bird, as if {{clutching}} it. <b>The</b> front right <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> resembles a human leg.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You wouldn't, I am sure,' said Mr. Snitchey, {{standing}} a small professional blue bag against one <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> 'cut <b>the</b> great farce short for this actress, at all events, Doctor Jeddler.' ...|$|R
60|$|Although he had {{not once}} been visited between meals, he thought it prudent not to begin the work of making his rope until the sun was getting low. When it did so he tore up the blankets, twisted and knotted {{together}} the strips, and then sat down to await {{the coming of the}} jailers. He had already tried to wrench off one of the <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> but it was too heavy and strongly made for him to succeed. He then thought of using the chair, but he could not feel certain of stunning the soldier with the first blow, and the latter might fire off his musket, or shout so loudly as to give the alarm; he therefore determined to trust to his hands alone. He knew that he was greatly superior in strength to any of the little Spanish soldiers, and that with the advantage of surprise he {{ought to be able to}} succeed without noise.|$|E
6000|$|It was so indeed: she was {{now only}} ten inches high, and her face brightened up as it {{occurred}} to her that {{she was now}} the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see whether she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this, [...] "for it might end, you know," [...] said Alice to herself, [...] "in my going out altogether, like a candle, and what should I be like then, I wonder?" [...] and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember having ever seen one. However, nothing more happened so she decided on going into the garden at once, but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for the key, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it plainly enough through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> but it was too slippery, and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.|$|E
5000|$|Christopher Scott in the New Scientist criticized Evans for {{his lack}} of {{scientific}} understanding. Scott noted that Evans was heavily biased and credulous for accepting reports of paranormal phenomena at face value. Evans in Intrusions (1982) had presented {{a photograph of the}} medium Eusapia Palladino allegedly levitating a table [...] "without trickery", but her hands or feet were not visible, nor two of the <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> Scott concluded that Evans description of the photograph was [...] "sheer fantasy".|$|E
6000|$|... "His lordship's bull-terrier, sir. His lordship won {{him in a}} raffle, {{and tied}} him to <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> If you will allow me, sir, I will go in and switch on the light." ...|$|R
60|$|O Heavens, it {{had come}} at last! He would find it was weak, he {{would say it was}} weak, and I was lost! I held tight to <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> under <b>the</b> cloth, with both hands, and awaited my fate.|$|R
60|$|I {{clutched}} <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> again immediately, {{and pressed}} it to my bosom {{as if it had}} been <b>the</b> companion <b>of</b> my youth and friend of my soul. I foresaw what was coming, and I felt that this time I really was gone.|$|R
50|$|The Numismatics Gallery has {{a display}} of Portuguese-era coins. The Furniture Gallery {{contains}} an intricately carved table and high-backed chairs {{which was part of}} the Portuguese Inquisition held in Goa of the 16th century. The <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> have carved lions and an eagle in one half and four figures of human beings in the other half. Furniture exhibits include a chair of the Portuguese Governor General, a sofa set with inlay work in ivory, ivory images of small size, chest of drawers and some western style furniture. In this gallery the prominent exhibit is of an intricately carved wooden chariot of the 18th century used in festivals.|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} things in life that we take for granted. Take for example, the mystery of a folding {{sunshade}}. What forces cause the sunshade to fold into a smaller circle and lock? There is actually a mathematical model for that process. Or consider a table that is used in everyday life. What are the forces that act on the <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table?</b> In this paper, we will analyze these forces and will try to compute their vectors. We will start with studying forces acting on a beam. Then we will work with triangular table and finally with parallelogramic table. We will show physical models that govern forces in those cases. We will describe some specific solutions...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{under which}} conditions a rectangular table {{can be placed}} with all four feet on a ground described by a function R 2 → R. We start by considering highly idealized tables that are just simple rectangles. We prove that given any rectangle, any continuous ground and any point on the ground, the rectangle can be positioned such that all its vertices {{are on the ground}} and its center is on the vertical through the distinguished point. This is a mathematical existence result and does not provide a practical way of actually finding a balancing position. An old, simple, beautiful, intuitive and applicable, but not very well known argument guarantees that a square table can be balanced on any ground that is not “too wild”, by turning it on the spot. In the main part of this paper we turn this intuitive argument into a mathematical theorem. More precisely, our theorem deals with rectangular tables each consisting of a solid rectangle as top and four line (segments) of equal length as legs. We prove that if the ground does not rise by more 1 √ 2 than arctan ≈ 35. 26 ◦ between any two of its points, and if the <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> are at leas...|$|E
60|$|Another {{slice of}} bread and butter: three, four: right. She didn't like her plate full. Right. He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the hob and set it {{sideways}} on the fire. It sat there, dull and squat, its spout stuck out. Cup of tea soon. Good. Mouth dry. The cat walked stiffly round a <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> with tail on high.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Truefitt, still {{coughing}} slightly, {{began to}} place chairs {{at a table}} on which, as the captain presently-proved to his own dissatisfaction, there was not even; room for a pair <b>of</b> elbows. At <b>the</b> last moment the seating arrangements had to be altered owing to a <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> which got in <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> Mrs. Willett’s. <b>The</b> captain, in his anxiety to be of service, lowered a leaf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> too far, and an avalanche of food descended to the floor.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Hush up, you old locoed road runner,' I interrupts. 'Did {{you ever}} notice your Uncle Buck locking doors against trouble? I'm not married,' says I, 'but I'm {{as big a}} d----n fool as any Mormon. One from four leaves three,' says I, and I gathers out another <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> 'We'll get home by seven,' says I, 'whether it's the heavenly one or the other. May I see you home?' says I, 'you sarsaparilla-drinking, checker-playing glutton for death and destruction.' ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{at eleven}} o'clock {{the next morning}} that the aunts and uncles came to hold their consultation. The fire was lighted in the large parlor, and poor Mrs. Tulliver, with a {{confused}} impression {{that it was a}} great occasion, like a funeral, unbagged the bell-rope tassels, and unpinned the curtains, adjusting them in proper folds, looking round and shaking her head sadly at the polished tops and <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables,</b> which sister Pullet herself could not accuse of insufficient brightness.|$|R
60|$|When the gas was lighted {{we found}} the cone had been placed on <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> a {{distance}} <b>of</b> forty inches from <b>the</b> utmost reach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> psychic's hands. Her feet were twenty-three inches from <b>the</b> nearest <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> We carefully examined the tapes which were sewed to her sleeves. They were tied, and the doubled ends tacked precisely as described so many times, and to remove the tacks {{we were forced to}} use a hammer. It is useless to talk of a possible release of her arms during <b>the</b> phenomena <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cone.|$|R
60|$|But, Uncle Pumblechook, who was omnipotent in that kitchen, wouldn't {{hear the}} word, wouldn't hear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subject, imperiously waved {{it all away}} with his hand, and asked for hot gin and water. My sister, who had begun to be alarmingly meditative, had to employ herself {{actively}} in getting the gin the hot water, the sugar, and the lemon-peel, and mixing them. For the time being at least, I was saved. I still held on to <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> but clutched it now with <b>the</b> fervor <b>of</b> gratitude.|$|R
60|$|The murderers {{swooped down}} upon their prey. Kerr of Faudonside flung a noose about his body, and drew it tight with a jerk that pulled the {{secretary}} from his knees. Then he and Morton took the rope between them, and so dragged their victim {{across the room}} towards the door. He struggled blindly as he went, vainly clutching first at an overset chair, then at a <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and screeching piteously the while to the Queen to save him. And Mary, trembling with passion, herself struggling in <b>the</b> arms <b>of</b> Darnley, flung an angry warning after them.|$|R
60|$|I couldn't keep my {{eyes off}} him. Always holding tight by <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> with my hands and feet, I saw the miserable {{creature}} finger his glass playfully, take it up, smile, throw his head back, and drink the brandy off. Instantly afterwards, the company were seized with unspeakable consternation, owing to his springing to his feet, turning round several times in an appalling spasmodic whooping-cough dance, and rushing out at the door; he then became visible through the window, violently plunging and expectorating, making the most hideous faces, and apparently out of his mind.|$|R
6000|$|The cloth was removed; {{the dessert}} was {{laid on the}} table; and the glasses were filled. <b>The</b> motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boat increased; several members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party began to feel rather vague and misty, and {{looked as if they}} had only just got up. The young gentleman with the spectacles, who had been in a {{fluctuating}} state for some time—at one moment bright, and at another dismal, like a revolving light on the sea-coast—rashly announced his wish to propose a toast. After several ineffectual attempts to preserve his perpendicular, the young gentleman, having managed to hook himself to <b>the</b> centre <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> with his left hand, proceeded as follows: ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{then the}} door was opened and there stood the {{furniture}} to view. There stood the furniture, except the three subtracted chairs, and <b>the</b> loo <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> claw and <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> indeed were standing there, but the top was folded up and {{lying on the floor}} beside it. [...] "I hope you'll like the pattern," [...] began Mrs. Mason. [...] "I'm told that it is the prettiest that has yet been brought out. There has been some little accident about <b>the</b> screw <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> but <b>the</b> smith in the village will put that to rights in five minutes. He lives so close to you that I didn't think it worth while to have him up here." ...|$|R
6000|$|Things {{came to a}} head {{this morning}} at breakfast. Clarence, my snake, has <b>the</b> cutest way <b>of</b> {{climbing}} up <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and looking at you pleadingly in the hope that you will give him soft-boiled egg, which he adores. He did it this morning, and no sooner had his head appeared above <b>the</b> <b>table</b> than Algie, with a kind of sharp wail, struck him a violent blow on the nose with a teaspoon. Then he turned to me, very pale, and said: 'Pauline, this must end! The time has come to speak up. A nervous, highly-strung man like myself should not, and must not, be called upon to live in a house where he is constantly meeting snakes and monkeys without warning. Choose between me and--' ...|$|R
50|$|Brandt {{died the}} next day after surgery in Rastenburg {{hospital}} and was posthumously promoted to Generalmajor by Hitler. Three other people also {{died as a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> explosion. It was later concluded that its exact positioning next to a <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> map <b>table</b> was a crucial factor in determining who in the room survived.|$|R
60|$|Fritz, the swineherd, sat {{eating his}} late supper of {{porridge}} {{out of a}} great, coarse, wooden bowl; wife Katherine sat at <b>the</b> other end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and <b>the</b> half-naked little children played upon the earthen floor. A shaggy dog lay curled up in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire, and a grunting pig scratched against a <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rude <b>table</b> close beside where the woman sat.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There is Mr. Tryan,' she said, and {{her pale}} cheek was lighted {{up with a}} little blush {{that would have made}} her look more {{attractive}} to almost any one except Miss Eliza Pratt, whose fine grey eyes allowed few things to escape her silent observation. 'Mary Linnet gets more and more in love with Mr. Tryan,' thought Miss Eliza; 'it is really pitiable to see such feelings in a woman of her age, with those old-maidish little ringlets. I daresay she flatters herself Mr. Tryan may fall in love with her, because he makes her useful among the poor.' At the same time, Miss Eliza, as she bent her handsome head and large cannon curls with apparent calmness over her work, felt a considerable internal flutter when she heard the knock at the door. Rebecca had less self-command. She felt too much agitated to go on with her pasting, and clutched <b>the</b> <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> to counteract <b>the</b> trembling in her hands.|$|R
5000|$|Palladino {{normally}} {{refused to}} allow someone beneath <b>the</b> <b>table</b> to hold her feet with his hands. She refused to levitate <b>the</b> <b>table</b> from a standing position. <b>The</b> <b>table</b> being rectangular, she had to sit only at a short side. No wall of any kind could stand between Palladino and <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> was seventeen pounds. <b>The</b> <b>table</b> levitated to a height of 3 to 10 inches for a maximum of 2-3 seconds. She was an expert at freeing a hand or foot to produce phenomena. She chose to sit at <b>the</b> short side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> so that her controllers on each side had to sit closer together, {{making it easier to}} deceive them. Her levitation of a table began by freeing one foot, rocking <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and then slipping her toe under one leg. Since she sat at <b>the</b> narrow end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> this was made possible. She lifted <b>the</b> <b>table</b> by rocking back on <b>the</b> heel <b>of</b> this foot. She made the [...] "spirit" [...] raps by striking a <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> with a free foot.|$|R
