60|$|This {{has been}} the Italian {{position}} ever since. The mind, that is the Light; the senses, they are the Darkness.

60|$|You must imagine me a black little creature, {{suddenly}} stricken still--for {{a moment}} standing rigid--and then again suddenly becoming active with an impotent gesture, becoming audible with an inarticulate cry, with two little shadows mocking my dismay, and about this figure you must conceive a great wide space of moonlit grass, rimmed by the looming suggestion of distant trees--trees very low and faint and dim, and over {{it all the}} domed serenity of that wonderful <b>luminous</b> <b>night.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>Night</b> <b>clouds</b> or {{noctilucent clouds}} are tenuous cloud-like {{phenomena}} {{in the upper}} atmosphere. They are made of ice crystals and are only visible in a deep twilight.

These clouds can be observed only during local summer months and when the Sun is below the horizon for the observer, but while the clouds are still in sunlight.|$|R
60|$|With {{a shudder}} of awe the ranger {{turned from the}} {{intolerable}} beauty of this combination of <b>night,</b> <b>cloud,</b> and mountain-crest, and resumed his climb.

Again and again he looked back, longing for some power which would enable him to record and reproduce for {{the eyes of his}} love some part of this stupendous and noiseless epic. He was no longer content to enjoy Nature's splendors alone.|$|R

60|$|He {{stopped for}} a few moments on a {{hillside}} and looked about him, while his heart throbbed faster. There was still a light or two in the hall behind him, but none in the village, and the earth lay asleep wrapped in fleecy draperies of drifting mist, while the low murmur of the river came out of the great stillness. He could see its pale blink where it slid out from the gloom of a wood, and above, across the stubble where the footpath led, a clump of rigid spires that rose black and solid against the faintly <b>luminous</b> <b>night.</b> That, he knew, was the fir spinny where he was to meet the blackmailer, and shaking all thought of his own affairs from him he went on quietly resolute to do battle for his friend. Appleby was an impulsive man, quick to decide; but there was also an obdurate persistency in him, and the decision once made was usually adhered to. Keeper Davidson was not to find an easy victim that night.|$|R
