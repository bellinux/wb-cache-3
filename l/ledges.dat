5|$|The game is {{presented}} from a single, 2D perspective, and revolves around Robbie the Robot's objective {{to defend his}} plant from interstellar space slugs. The plant grows from a pot at the bottom centre of the screen, and spray cans containing three different pesticides are located on <b>ledges</b> {{on each side of}} the screen. Bonus items such as fertiliser and spades appear on unoccupied <b>ledges</b> which will increase both the players score and the plant's growth rate.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Ledge</b> Curl variant uses a fixed <b>ledge</b> between {{waist and}} chest height to provide resistance. The hands are balled into fists and {{placed under the}} <b>ledge.</b> The {{individual}} then bends over slowly while pressing up against {{the bottom of the}} <b>ledge,</b> then returns slowly to the starting position, maintaining the same level of resistance along the way.|$|R
5|$|Desert {{conditions}} persist on canyon bottoms {{and rocky}} <b>ledges</b> away from perennial streams.

5|$|Adult hawksbill {{sea turtles}} are {{primarily}} found in tropical coral reefs. They are usually seen resting in caves and <b>ledges</b> {{in and around}} these reefs throughout the day. As a highly migratory species, they inhabit {{a wide range of}} habitats, from the open ocean to lagoons and even mangrove swamps in estuaries. Little is known about the habitat preferences of early life-stage E. imbricata; like other young sea turtles, they are assumed to be completely pelagic, remaining at sea until they mature.|$|E
5|$|Bobcat {{activities}} {{are confined to}} well-defined territories, which vary in size depending on the sex {{and the distribution of}} prey. The home range is marked with feces, urine scent, and by clawing prominent trees in the area. In its territory, the bobcat has numerous places of shelter, usually a main den, and several auxiliary shelters on the outer extent of its range, such as hollow logs, brush piles, thickets, or under rock <b>ledges.</b> Its den smells strongly of the bobcat.|$|E
5|$|Considered {{the most}} {{specialized}} member of its family, the tasselled wobbegong's ornate coloration and complex dermal fringe grants it excellent camouflage, {{while it is}} probably a slower swimmer than related species. It is solitary and spends {{most of the day}} lying motionless inside caves or under <b>ledges</b> with its tail curled up. Individual sharks have a small home range, containing several preferred resting spots that are used repeatedly. This species becomes more active at night, swimming onto the reef to hunt.|$|E

5|$|The condor is {{primarily}} a scavenger, feeding on carrion. It prefers large carcasses, {{such as those of}} deer or cattle. It reaches sexual maturity at five or six years of age and nests at elevations of up to , generally on inaccessible rock <b>ledges.</b> One or two eggs are usually laid. It is one of the world's longest-living birds, with a lifespan of over 70 years in some cases.|$|E
5|$|The crag martins mainly breed on dry, {{warm and}} {{sheltered}} cliffs in mountainous areas with crags and gorges, and the Eurasian crag martin reaches 5,000m (16,500ft) in Central Asia. The use of buildings as artificial cliffs has enabled breeding expansion into lowland areas, {{particularly for the}} two tropical species, and the rock martin breeds in desert towns. In South Asia, migrant Eurasian birds sometimes join with flocks of the dusky crag martin and roost communally on <b>ledges</b> of cliffs or buildings in winter.|$|E
5000|$|Mirsky <b>Ledge</b> A snow-covered <b>ledge,</b> or shelf-like feature, about 16 km NE of Mount Schopf. Urbanak Peak and Iversen Peak {{rise above}} the <b>ledge</b> which is the {{apparent}} northeast extremity of the Horlick Mountains. The geology of these mountains was investigated by researchers from the Institute of Polar Studies, Ohio State University, 1958-62. The <b>ledge</b> was named by US-ACAN for Arthur Mirsky, Assistant Director of the Institute in that period.|$|R

5000|$|Cleft <b>Ledge</b> (...) is a flat-topped ridge 1 nmi km {{long and}} 0.3 nmi km wide between Shaw Trough and Healy Trough in the Labyrinth of Wright Valley, McMurdo Dry Valleys. The <b>ledge</b> rises to 920 m and is 0.3 {{nautical}} {{miles northwest of}} Hoffman <b>Ledge.</b> The name is descriptive and was recommended by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (2004) because a central north-south hanging valley nearly divides the <b>ledge</b> in half.|$|R
5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon nests in a scrape, normally on cliff edges. The female chooses a nest site, where she scrapes a shallow hollow in the loose soil, sand, gravel, or dead vegetation {{in which to}} lay eggs. No nest materials are added. Cliff nests are generally located under an overhang, on <b>ledges</b> with vegetation. South-facing sites are favoured. In some regions, as in parts of Australia and {{on the west coast}} of northern North America, large tree hollows are used for nesting. Before the demise of most European peregrines, a large population of peregrines in central and western Europe used the disused nests of other large birds. In remote, undisturbed areas such as the Arctic, steep slopes and even low rocks and mounds may be used as nest sites. In many parts of its range, peregrines now also nest regularly on tall buildings or bridges; these human-made structures used for breeding closely resemble the natural cliff <b>ledges</b> that the peregrine prefers for its nesting locations.|$|E
5|$|A 1947 {{newspaper}} article {{estimated that the}} new park would have 50,000visitors that year, and detailed the work the state had done since acquiring the land. The Falls Trail through the glens was rebuilt, all the stone steps were replaced, and signs were added. Out of concern for greater safety, footbridges with handrails replaced those made from hewn logs, overhanging rock <b>ledges</b> were removed in places, and the trail was rerouted near some falls. In {{the southern end of}} the new park, the state built the Evergreen Trail past Adams Falls, as well as a new parking area for 200cars and a concession stand, both along Pennsylvania Route 118 (PA 118).|$|E
5|$|American kestrels are cavity nesters, {{but they}} are able to adapt {{to a wide variety of}} nesting situations. They {{generally}} prefer natural cavities (such as in trees) with closed tops and tight fitting entrances, as to provide for maximum protection of the eggs and young. Kestrels occasionally nest in holes created by large woodpeckers, or use the abandoned nests of other birds, such as red-tailed hawks, merlins, and crows. They have been recorded nesting on cliff <b>ledges</b> and building tops, as well as in abandoned cavities in cactuses. American kestrels also commonly utilize nesting boxes.|$|E

50|$|New London <b>Ledge</b> Lighthouse {{was built}} in 1909 on the Southwest <b>Ledge.</b> It was {{originally}} called the Southwest <b>Ledge</b> light, but it was felt this could be confused with another lighthouse in New Haven, the Southwest <b>Ledge</b> Light, so in 1910 the lighthouse was renamed to New London <b>Ledge</b> Light. The United States Coast Guard took over in 1939 upon its merger with the Lighthouse Service and the light was automated in 1987. The original fourth order Fresnel lens was removed and was later put {{on display in the}} Custom House Maritime Museum. In 1990 the light was added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|R

The only way to gain it was by first leaping to the <b>ledge</b> of rock. She studied it carefully, and the tightening of her bridle-arm advertised that she had made up her mind.|$|R
5|$|At one point, Eddy Creek {{flows through}} a {{restored}} channel at a reclaimed mining site. Further downstream, the creek flows through its natural channel and cuts across {{a number of}} rock <b>ledges.</b> However, {{by the time it}} crosses US Route 6, it has lost its flow. Nevertheless, its channel is still discernible and its gradient is shallower. The creek loses its channel completely at the intersection of an electric transmission corridor and the Eddy Creek Mine Tunnel. It eventually reappears, but disappears again in strip pits and sinks. From Birds Eye Mine to Underwood Road, the stream channel has been completely destroyed. The creek has an engineered channel in one reach where it passes through a residential area.|$|E
5|$|Big Run, a {{tributary}} stream of the South Branch Potomac River, flows north bisecting the Wappocomo property, bordered by dense foliage. Shortly before it enters Wappocomo farm, Big Run flows alongside <b>ledges</b> of gray shale known to contain Chonetes and Camarotoechia fossils. A smaller unnamed stream {{flows through the}} front lawn of the house at Wappocomo before curving northwest toward its confluence with Big Run. Corn is the primary crop produced in Wappocomo's agricultural fields along the South Branch Potomac River, which consist of rich alluvial soils.|$|E
5|$|Fare {{control is}} in a glass-enclosed headhouse {{building}} off of Main Street. The headhouse has {{a feature that}} is unusual to the subway system: it uses recordings of birds to try to scare away city pigeons, and these bird recordings play every few minutes or so. The system was installed because of issues with pigeons entering the headhouse and leaving feathers and droppings both inside and around the building. Previous efforts, like spiked <b>ledges,</b> had been ineffective in curbing the pigeon population of the area immediately next to the station.|$|E
