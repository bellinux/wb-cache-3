40|$|Linking {{emissions}} trading schemes allows the combined emissions target {{to be achieved}} at lower cost. Linking is usually environmentally neutral, but some design features can lead to poorer environmental performance if the schemes are linked. Changes to the relevant provisions can be implemented when the linkage agreement is negotiated. Environmental effectiveness also requires the administrators of the linked schemes {{to ensure that the}} stringency of the emissions cap, the accuracy of the emissions reported by affected sources, the integrity of the allowance registry, and the effectiveness of enforcement activity is maintained over time given future technological and administrative developments. This will require a process for agreeing on revisions to the regulations of the linked schemes, a mechanism to provide assurance of the environmental effectiveness of each of the linked schemes, and a procedure for terminating the <b>linking</b> <b>agreement...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background. The "Extended ICF Core Set for stroke" is an {{application}} of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and represents the typical spectrum of problems in functioning of people with stroke. Objective. The objective {{of this study was}} to validate this ICF Core Set from the perspective of physical therapists. Design and methods. Physical therapists experienced in stroke intervention were asked about their patients' problems and resources and about aspects of the environment that physical therapists treat in people with stroke in a 3 -round electronic-mail survey using the Delphi technique. The responses were linked to the ICF. The degree of agreement was calculated using the kappa statistic. Results. One hundred twenty-five physical therapists from 24 countries named 4, 793 problems treated by physical therapists in people with stroke. They identified 10 second-level ICF categories that currently are not represented in the Extended ICF Core Set for stroke. Twelve responses of the participants were linked to the ICF component personal factors, and 15 responses were not covered by the current version of the classification. The kappa coefficient for the <b>linking</b> <b>agreement</b> was 0. 39 (95 % bootstrapped confidence interval= 0. 34 - 0. 41). Limitations. Two World Health Organization regions were not represented in the sample of physical therapists. Conclusions. According to the physical therapists, the current version of the Extended ICF Core Set for stroke largely covers the types of problems that their interventions address. However, some aspects of functioning emerged that are not yet covered and may need further investigation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The broadened {{scope of}} the GATT/WTO through {{successive}} rounds of trade liberalization is explained {{as a result of}} trade-partner specificity, <b>linked</b> <b>agreements,</b> and cross retaliation. In more recent years, however, countries have pursued trade liberalization through sector specific zero-for-zero agreements and preferential trade agreements, both of which have a reduced chance of suffering cross retaliation. This increase in unlinked agreements is explained by imperfect observability of trade policies generating gratuitous trade disputes and unjustified cross retaliation. If the dispute generating noise is perfectly correlated across sectors, however, then it provides no reason not to <b>link</b> <b>agreements</b> in a static sense and in many cases incremental linking still produces more liberalization than static linking. It is only when the noise is imperfectly correlated that linking and cross retaliation are problematic so that some sectors can enforce more liberalization in an unlinked agreement. If the correlation drops, the noise increases, or the number of sectors already covered is large, then incremental linking of more sectors is inefficient and countries pursue unlinked agreements...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} obstacles against further cooperation in international economic relations. The first essay explains the gradual nature of trade liberalization. I show that existence of asymmetric information between governments provides a sufficient reason for gradualism to exist. Governments prefer starting small {{to reduce the}} cost of partner’s betrayal when there is sufficient degree of information asymmetry regarding the partner’s type. Learning about partner’s incentive structure enhances expectations, encouraging governments to increase their current level of cooperation. Specifically, the uninformed government’s subjective belief for the trading partner being good is improved as the partner acts cooperatively. This updated belief, in turn, lowers the subjective probability of future betrayal, enabling further progress in cooperation. ^ The second essay analyzes the relationship between two countries facing two policy dilemmas in an environment with two way goods and capital flows. When issues are independent and countries are symmetric, signing separate agreements for tariffs (Free Trade Agreements-FTA) and for taxes (Tax Treaties-TT) provides the identical level of enforcement as signing a <b>linked</b> <b>agreement.</b> However, linkage can still improve the joint welfare by transferring the slack enforcement power in a case of asymmetric issues or countries. I report non-results in two cases where the policy issues are interconnected due to technological spillover effect of FDI. Moreover, I show that <b>linking</b> the <b>agreements</b> actually reduces enforcement when <b>agreements</b> are <b>linked</b> under a limited punishment rule and policy variables are strategic substitutes. ^ The third essay investigates the welfare/enforcement consequences of linking trade and environmental agreements. In the standard literature, <b>linking</b> the <b>agreements</b> generate non-trivial results only when there is structural relation between the issues. I focus on institutional design of the linkage and show that even if environmental aspects of international trade are negligible <b>linking</b> the <b>agreements</b> might still have some interesting welfare implications under current GATT Rules. Specifically, when traded goods are substitutes in consumption, <b>linking</b> the environmental <b>agreement</b> with trade agreement under the Withdrawal of Equivalent Concession Rule (Article XXVIII) will reduce the enforcement. However, enforcement in environmental issue increases when the same rule is implemented in the absence of linkage. ...|$|R
