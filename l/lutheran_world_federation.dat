50|$|After the Second World War the <b>World</b> <b>Lutheran</b> <b>Federation</b> (WLF) {{took care}} of the {{remnants}} of the German-initiated Evangelical missions, combining Lutheran, Calvinist and united Protestant efforts.

In 1947, the Lutheran mission was granted autonomy from the Evangelical Church in Germany and in 1959 was recognised as an autonomous religious community by King Hussein of Jordan. The church was then officially named the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Jordan (ELCJ). The ELCJ had by then grew beyond Jerusalem and had set up congregations in Ramallah and Amman to serve Lutheran Palestinians who were refugees of the Arab-Israeli conflict.|$|R
