2500|$|A Venn diagram (also called primary diagram, set diagram or <b>logic</b> <b>diagram)</b> is {{a diagram}} that shows all {{possible}} logical relations between a finite collection of different sets. [...] These diagrams depict elements as {{points in the}} plane, and sets as regions inside closed curves. [...] A Venn diagram consists of multiple overlapping closed curves, usually circles, each representing a set. [...] The points inside a curve labelled S represent elements of the set S, while points outside the boundary represent elements not in the set S. [...] Thus, for example, the set of all elements that are members of both sets S and T, S∩T, is represented visually by the area of overlap of the regions S and T. [...] In Venn diagrams the curves are overlapped in every possible way, showing all possible relations between the sets. [...] They are thus a special case of Euler diagrams, which do not necessarily show all relations. Venn diagrams were conceived around 1880 by John Venn. They are used to teach elementary set theory, as well as illustrate simple set relationships in probability, logic, statistics, linguistics and computer science.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{cognitive}} study of diagrammatic representations for deductive reasoning, the availability of syntactic manipulation of diagrams has {{played a key role in}} accounting for their efficacy. Currently, however, little has been known about the interface between such syntactic or proof-theoretical aspects and the corresponding semantic or informational aspects of diagram use. The present paper investigates the cognitive processes of interpreting diagrammatic representations underlying deductive reasoning, combining the insights from both logical and cognitive studies of diagrams. A semantical analysis of two different ways of formalizing <b>logic</b> <b>diagrams</b> is provided. Based on it, a multiple stage model of cognitive processes of extracting information from <b>logic</b> <b>diagrams</b> is proposed, and evidence was found to support this model.

40|$|Although <b>logic</b> <b>diagrams</b> {{are widely}} used as methods for {{introducing}} students to elementary logical reasoning, it is still open to debate in cognitive psychology whether diagrams can aid untrained people to successfully conduct deductive reasoning.

However, the question of why certain diagrams but not others have such inferential efficacy in performing syllogism reasoning has not been fully answered. Based on a proof-theoretical analysis of categorical syllogisms and diagrammatic reasoning, we supplement our previous study of cognitive efficacy of diagrams and argue that the relational information underlying quantified sentences plays a crucial role in understanding the efficacy of diagrams in syllogistic reasoning. The distinctive features of our conception of diagrammatic reasoning are made clear by comparing it with the model-theoretic conception of ordinary reasoning developed in the mental model theory...|$|R
