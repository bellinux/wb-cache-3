40|$|Comparison of {{baby boom}} in the 1970 s and in the 2000 s in the Czech Republic Abstract We could have {{registered}} two significant periods of sudden growth of <b>live-born</b> <b>children</b> in the Czech Republic after year 1945, in the 1970 s and in the 2000 s. The main aim of this thesis is to compare the periods of baby-boom in 1969 - 1979 and 2001 - 2011. The population policy and population climate was compared. The indicators of fertility were counted using demographic analysis methods. The indicators helped identify the process of baby-booms. The improvement of financial and housing situation of young families in both periods had the main influence on the growth of <b>live-born</b> <b>children.</b> The growth of natality was mainly influenced by the increased number of young women in reproduction age. The results confirmed that the well targeted population policy can improve the population climate and subsequently increase the growth of <b>live-born</b> <b>children.</b> Keywords: baby boom, population policy, population climate, fertility, the Czech Republi...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Cleft lip and palate is {{a complex}} {{congenital}} anomaly of the orofacial system in children. Objective. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the incidence of <b>live-born</b> <b>children</b> with cleft lip and/or palate compared to the total number of children born in the period from January 1, 1990 to December 31, 2007. Methods. Epidemiological investigation was based on the records of <b>live-born</b> <b>children</b> at the Hospital of Gynaecology and Obstetrics of the Clinical Centre Niš. The study included 61, 116 <b>live-born</b> <b>children,</b> i. e. 56, 905 full-term babies. Results. The total number of registered clefts during the investigation period was 43 (22 boys and 21 girls). The most frequent were the secondary palate clefts (44. 2 %); combined clefts were present in 34. 9 %, while primary palate clefts were reported in 20. 9 %. In respect to the season and order of birth, there was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of the primary, secondary and complete palate clefts. The age of mothers was not identified as a risk factor for the occurrence of cleft lip and palate. Conclusion. In the studied period, 43 children were born with the cleft lip and/or palate, equally in boys as in girls. The secondary palate clefts were most frequent.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Transfer {{of several}} embryos after IVF {{results in a}} high {{multiple}} birth rate associated with increased morbidity and high costs for the neonatal care. In a previous randomized trial we demonstrated that a sin-gle embryo transfer (SET) strategy, including one fresh single embryo transfer and, if no live birth, one additional frozen–thawed SET, resulted in a live-birth rate that was not substantially lower than after double embryo transfer (DET) but markedly reduced the multiple birth rate. METHODS: We compared costs for maternal health care and productivity losses and paediatric costs for the SET and DET strategies. In addition, maternal and paediatric out-comes {{between the two groups}} were compared. RESULTS: The SET strategy resulted in lower average total costs from treatment until 6 months after delivery. There were a few more deliveries with at least one <b>live-born</b> <b>child</b> in the DET group. The incremental cost per extra delivery in the DET alternative was high, € 71 940. The rates of prema-turely born and low birthweight children were significantly lower with the SET strategy. There were also markedly fewer maternal and paediatric complications in the SET group. CONCLUSIONS: The SET strategy is superior to the DET strategy, when number of deliveries with at least one <b>live-born</b> <b>child,</b> incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and maternal and paediatric complications are taken into consideration.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Season {{of birth}} has been {{reported}} to affect later reproduction in samples of pre-modern women and contemporary men. METHODS: To examine whether the effect of birth date is also valid in contemporary women, we investigated the association between birth month and measures of reproductive performance (number of <b>live-born</b> <b>children,</b> % childless individuals) in a representative sample of contemporary Austrian women. RESULTS: Among reproducing women, birth month is signi®cantly associated with the number of <b>live-born</b> <b>children</b> (n = 2839, P = 0. 032).

In this study, we estimated the attendance to the second-trimester fetal malformation screening program. We also estimated the {{positive predictive value}} (PPV) of prenatally assigned International Classification of Disease- 10 diagnoses recorded in the Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR) and the completeness of case registration. We used kidney anomalies as an example. Methods: We identified the proportion of all Danish <b>live-born</b> <b>children</b> from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2012, who were scanned during the second trimester using the DNPR and the Civil Registration System. Details of all fetuses with specific kidney anomaly diagnoses according to the DNPR were retrieved. The PPV was estimated using the nationwide Astraia database of pregnancy medical charts or traditional medical charts, as gold standard. The completeness was assessed using {{the total number of}} cases estimated by the capture–recapture method. Results: Of 372, 263 live born infants, 97. 3 % were scanned during the second trimester. We identified 172 fetuses in the DNPR. Of these, 149 had kidney anomalies according to Astraia or medical chart review, corresponding to a PPV of 87 % (95 % CI: 81 %– 91 %). The estimated completeness was 43 % (95 % CI: 38 %– 49 %) for the DNPR and 75 % (95 % CI: 70 %– 79 %) for Astraia. Conclusion: Almost all <b>live-born</b> <b>children</b> were scanned during the second trimester in Denmark. However, low completeness may hamper the use of the DNPR for studies of prenatally detected severe malformations, and use of the Astraia database may preferably be considered.

Women with a first singleton delivery after 37 weeks were followed until the end of 2010, from a first birth to include subsequent live births. We used Cox's proportional hazards model stratified by parity to compare the likelihood for subsequent delivery according to mode of delivery at first and later births, estimating maternal age effects and lag time to next delivery. Likelihood of a subsequent <b>live-born</b> <b>child</b> by previous delivery mode. We identified 642, 052 women with a first delivery. Compared with women with a non-instrumental vaginal delivery, delivering a child by elective cesarean section implied a 23 % (95 % CI 0. 76 - 0. 787) decreased likelihood for subsequent delivery. Emergency cesarean section meant 16 % fewer (95 % CI 0. 84 - 0. 85), and vaginal instrumental delivery 4 % fewer subsequent deliveries (95 % CI 0. 95 - 0. 96). Hazard ratios were largely unchanged after controlling for parity and year of birth. Small age-trends were seen, with hazard ratios affected by maternal age at birth. Delivery mode at first birth affected marginally the time lag until next birth.

We conducted a retrospective study in a Dutch cohort of HIV-positive pregnant women and their children. We identified co-infected mothers. Results of the HCV tests of the children were obtained. All 21 women were on cART at the time of delivery. We analyzed data of the 24 <b>live-born</b> <b>children</b> at risk for mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HCV between 1996 and 2009.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Single embryo {{transfer}} (SET) {{is the sole}} strategy with which to {{reduce the incidence of}} twins following assisted reproductive technology (ART), but SET may increase the number of ART cycles needed per <b>live-born</b> <b>child.</b> Its cost-effectiveness compared with double {{embryo transfer}} (DET) is therefore unknown. METHODS: A decision-analytic model comparing SET with DET was developed. Estimates were obtained from literature, national pregnancy registers and local hospital records. A sensitivity analysis was performed, using pregnancy rates from four published studies. The outcome measure was the cost per child born, calculated from IVF procedure-related, pregnancy-related and neonatal care costs. Neonatal mortality and long-term morbidity costs were not taken into account. RESULTS: Independently of the pregnancy rates used, the SET cost per child born was in all instances the same as with DET, varying from C 9 520 (SET) versus C 9 511 (DET) to C 12 254 (SET) versus C 12 934 (DET). CONCLUSIONS: More ART cycles are required to obtain the same numbers of children born following SET compared with DET. Because SET allows the avoidance of twins and thus diminishes pregnancy-related and neonatal care costs, there is no difference in the cost per child born between SET and DET. The real advantage of SET is the avoidance of the very high long-term costs resulting from the increased morbidity of twins after birth.

From each <b>live-born</b> <b>child</b> urine for CMV culture was collected within 7 days after birth. Each fetus expelled after a spontaneous second trimester abortion and each stillborn infant were also evaluated for a possible congenital CMV infection. For each congenital infection stored maternal sera were analysed to determine whether maternal infection was primary or recurrent. Fifteen out of the 3075 pregnancies studied resulted in a congenitally infected infant (0. 49 %). Nine maternal CMV infections were primary infections; five were recurrent infections, and in one case the type of infection could not be determined. Three congenital infections resulted in severe sequelae, lending to the termination of pregnancy in two instances and to neonatal death in one case. One of these severe fetal infections was due to a recurrent maternal infection. Follow-up of the other 12 neonates demonstrated hearing disorders in two children. One was born after a primary maternal infection and one after a recurrent maternal infection. We conclude that congenital CMV infections occurs in 0. 49 % of all pregnancies in the population studied.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{retrospectively}} analyse the cost-effectiveness of different types of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) protocols and regimes used in in vitro fertilization procedures at a national level. Information was gathered from the National Centre for Assisted Reproduction (Bulgaria). Out of 2849 patients, 2757 were included in the study. The patients were treated with three main protocols: gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) -antagonist protocol, GnRH-agonist protocol and COH protocols without GnRH-analogues. In all main COH protocols, different types of gonadotrophins were combined in seven therapeutic schemes. A decision tree model was built for the cost-effectiveness analysis. Each decision node representing the three main COH protocols included seven possible chance nodes representing the COH therapeutic regimens. The results were evaluated based on the number of live-born children. The mean cost differed statistically significant between the three main types of protocols (p = 0. 0001) and between all seven COH regimens. In terms of live birth, the GnRH agonist protocols were more effective, followed by GnRH-antagonist protocols and those without GnRH-analogues. The decision tree model confirmed that considering the probability of the therapeutic regimens being prescribed, the GnRH-agonist protocol is the cost-effective one with the smallest cost per <b>live-born</b> <b>child</b> (5033, 51 BGN). The other two protocols could also be considered cost-effective because the incremental cost effectiveness ratio is very low and is below the gross domestic product per capita for 2015. The Governmental Authorities, considering also the cost-effectiveness criteria, should carefully revise the trend towards a wider use of GnRH-antagonist protocols...|$|E
40|$|Worldwide {{research}} on fertility {{in the second}} decade of life has shown that young mothers complete fewer years of schooling than their nulliparous age peers and women who postpone their first childbirth until age 20 or later. In Brazil, few studies have identified {{the extent to which}} these gaps were already present before fertility. Thus, it is difficult to assess the real effect of pregnancy and fertility on young mothers' education. This paper comprises an analysis of the educational progress of a representative sample (n = 225) of young women living in Campinas, a municipality of one million inhabitants in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. All individuals in the sample had their first <b>live-born</b> <b>child</b> between the ages of 17 and 19 in 2005 and were interviewed between 2006 and 2007. Their schooling histories from age seven to 16 (when all were still nulliparous) were then reconstituted longitudinally by the use of retrospective questions. The high incidence of academic failures and interruptions in studies prior to the subjects' pregnancies and first live births indicates that many of them had encountered obstacles in their schooling career before fertility: 28. 0 % failed and dropped out while 78. 2 % failed or dropped out of at least one school grade before pregnancy and their first live birth. Thus, cross-sectional studies that analyze the schooling deficits of young mothers only after their first pregnancy or childbirth and directly compare them to the school achievements of childless women-or those who delayed their first childbirth after the age of 20 -may not properly identify the origins of age-school grade gaps and the few years of schooling completed...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{individual}} {{chances for}} a <b>live-born</b> <b>child</b> in azoospermic men by performance of testicular sperm extraction (TESE) followed by intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI). DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. SETTING: An academic fertility care center and research unit. PATIENT(S) : Two hundred three couples who wished to have a child; all men had azoospermia. INTERVENTION(S) : All men were operated for TESE; 112 men {{were found to have}} elongated spermatids (ES), and 209 ICSI cycles were performed in these men using cryopreserved tissue. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Predictors for the chances to obtain live sperm and for probabilities of fertilization, clinical pregnancies, and live births. RESULT(S) : Testicular volume, FSH, and inhibin B levels were predictors for the presence of ES. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection resulted in 23 pregnancies, leading to 20 live births. Despite the presence of ES and performance of ICSI in cases of FSH levels >or= 20 IU/L, no pregnancy resulted in these men (n = 21). Receiver operating characteristics revealed FSH levels of >or= 20 IU/L as cutoff for treatment success. The number of testicular tubuli containing ES served as a predictor for clinical pregnancy as well as for live birth. Cigarette smoking by the male partner exerted a significant negative influence on treatment success. CONCLUSION(S) : The degree of completely maintained spermatogenesis within the biopsy appears to reflect intrinsic abilities of spermatozoa to induce normal embryo development. Charts based on regression models are presented for counseling patients before TESE; these explain chances of finding ES and probability of successful ICSI. Obtaining offspring is unlikely in cases of azoospermia and of FSH levels of >or= 20 IU/L...|$|E
5000|$|Until the 1990s, Russia and the Soviet Union did not count, as a {{live birth}} {{or as an}} infant death, {{extremely}} premature infants (less than 1,000 g, less than 28 weeks gestational age, or less than 35 cm in length) that were born alive (breathed, had a heartbeat, or exhibited voluntary muscle movement) but failed to survive for at least seven days. Although such extremely premature infants typically accounted for only about 0.5% of all <b>live-born</b> <b>children,</b> their exclusion from both the numerator and the denominator in the reported IMR led to an estimated 22%-25% lower reported IMR. In some cases, too, perhaps because hospitals or regional health departments were held accountable for lowering the IMR in their catchment area, infant deaths {{that occurred in the}} 12th month were [...] "transferred" [...] statistically to the 13th month (i.e., the second year of life), and thus no longer classified as an infant death.|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{information}} from {{studies conducted in}} Pakistan has indicated {{a high level of}} offspring mortality that can be attributed to parental consanguinity even when non-biological variables are controlled. However, with the exception of some small and geographically restricted studies, few comparable data are available on the influence of inbreeding in child survival among the Muslim population of India, which numbers between 100 and 120 million. The present study compares deaths during the first 5 years of life among the offspring of first cousin (F = 0. 0625) and non-consanguineous unions (F = 0), using data collected in the 1992 – 1993 Indian National Family Health Survey (NFHS) and the 1990 – 1991 Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS). The focus was on determinants of mortality in <b>live-born</b> <b>children</b> to age 5 years. In both countries, bivariate analyses indicated that mortality was significantly increased in the offspring of first cousin unions during the neonatal and post-neonatal, total infant, and under- 5 year periods. The findings were confirmed by multivariate regression, which incorporated control for a range of biological and demographic factors...|$|R

The aim of our {{study was to investigate}} the incidence of such defects in children born in Iceland during a period of 10 years, extending from 1990 through 1999. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information about the patients was obtained from medical records from two hospitals that cover the whole country, a private clinic of pediatric cardiologists, an echocardiography database, autopsy reports, and death certificates. We investigated the distribution of specific malformations, the age at diagnosis, the symptoms leading to the diagnosis, the source of referral, and treatment and quality of life. RESULTS: Between 1990 and 1999, there were 44, 013 live births in Iceland, of which 740 patients were diagnosed with congenital cardiac malformations, accounting for 1. 7 % of the <b>live-born</b> <b>children.</b> The distribution was made up of 338 patients with ventricular septal defect (45. 7 %), 90 with atrial septal defect (12. 2 %), 85 with patency of the arterial duct (11. 5 %), 48 with pulmonary valvar stenosis (6. 5 %), 38 with a bicuspid aortic valve (5. 1 %), 28 with aortic coarctation (3. 8 %), 22 with tetralogy of Fallot (3. 0 %), 14 with transposed great arteries (1. 9 %), 11 with aortic stenosis (1. 5 %), 10 with atrioventricular septal defect and common atrioventricular orifice (1. 4 %), 9 with mitral valvar regurgitation (1. 2 %), 7 with sub-aortic stenosis (0. 9 %), and 5 with hypoplasia of the left heart (0. 7 %). Extracardiac anomalies were seen in 89 patients (12. 0 %). Chromosomal defects were seen in 36 patients, of whom 28 had Down's syndrome. DISCUSSION: The annual incidence of diagnosis of patients with congenital cardiac malformations increased during the period of study. This was noted for minor defects, but the incidence of the major anomalies did not alter. Our observed yearly incidence, at 1. 7 %, was higher than noted in a previous study covering the years 1985 through 1989, and is also higher than in other population-based studies. The most likely explanation is the fact that access to pediatric cardiologists in Iceland is very good. Diagnosis, registration, and follow-up are conducted by only a few cardiologists, and take place at a single center for pediatric cardiology...|$|R
