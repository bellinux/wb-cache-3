40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Background: Elucidating the lithium {{disilicate}} {{system like}} the popular IPS e. max® CAD (LS 2), made specifically for Computer-Aided Design and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAD-CAM), {{as a function}} of temperature unravels new ways to enhance material properties and performance. Objective: To study the effect of various thermal processing on the crystallization kinetics, crystallite microstructure, and strength of LS 2. Methods: The control group of the LS 2 samples was heated using the standard manufacturer heating-schedule. Two experimental groups were tested: (1) an extended temperature range (750 - 840 °C vs. 820 - 840 °C) at the segment of 30 °C/min heating rate, and (2) a protracted holding time (14 min vs. 7 min) at the isothermal temperature of 840 °C. Five other groups of different heating schedules with lower-targeted temperatures were evaluated to investigate the microstructural changes. For each group, the crystalline phases and morphologies were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) respectively. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) was used to determine the activation energy of LS 2 under non-isothermal conditions. A MTS universal testing machine was used to measure 3 -point flexural strength and fracture toughness, and elastic modulus and hardness were measured by the MTS Nanoindenter® XP. A one-way ANOVA/Tukey was performed per property (alpha = 0. 05). Results: DSC, XRD, and SEM revealed three distinct microstructures during LS 2 crystallization. Significant {{differences were found between the}} control group, the two aforementioned experimental groups, and the five lower-targeted-temperature groups per property (p< 0. 05). The activation energy for lithium disilicate growth was 667. 45 (± 28. 97) KJ/mole. Conclusions: Groups with the extended temperature range (750 - 840 °C) and protracted holding time (820 - 840 °C H 14) produced significantly higher elastic-modulus and hardness properties than the control group but showed similar significant flexural-strength and fracture-toughness properties with the control group.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} first study on the {{mechanical}} behavior of <b>lithium</b> <b>metasilicate</b> glass-ceramic using nanoindentation and in situ scanning probe imaging techniques. Indentation contact hardness, H-c, and Young's modulus, E, were measured at 10 mN peak load and 0. 1 - 2 mN/s loading rates to understand the loading rate effect on its properties. Indentation imprints were analysed with the in situ scanning probe imaging to understand indentation mechanisms. The average contact hardness increased by 112 % with the loading rate (ANOVA, p 0. 05). A strain rate sensitivity model was applied to determine the intrinsic contact hardness. Extensive discontinuities and largest maximum, contact and final depths were also observed at the lowest loading rate. These phenomena corresponded to inhomogeneous shear-band flow and densification leading to the material strain softening. The in situ scanning probe images of indentation imprints showed plastic deformation at all loading rates and shear band-induced pileups at the lowest loading rate. With the increase in loading rate, the induced pile-ups decreased. The continuum model predicted the largest densified shear zone at the lowest loading rate. Finally, these results provide scientific insights into the abrasive machining responses of <b>lithium</b> <b>metasilicate</b> glass-ceramic during dental CAD/CAM processes using sharp diamond abrasives...|$|E

Addition of equimolar amounts of K 2 O and Al 2 O 3 to binary lithium silicate glass compositions improves chemical resistance, sintering behaviour and mechanical properties of the glassceramics produced from sintered glass powder compacts.
