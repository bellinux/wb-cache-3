5|$|Modern {{methods of}} {{producing}} <b>lager</b> were pioneered by Gabriel Sedlmayr the Younger, who perfected dark brown lagers at the Spaten Brewery in Bavaria, and Anton Dreher, who began brewing a <b>lager</b> (now known as Vienna <b>lager),</b> probably of amber-red colour, in Vienna in 1840–1841. With improved modern yeast strains, most <b>lager</b> breweries use only {{short periods of}} cold storage, typically 1–3 weeks.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} sales volume, most of today's beer {{is based on}} the pale <b>lager</b> brewed in 1842 in the town of Pilsen in the present-day Czech Republic. The modern pale <b>lager</b> is light in colour with a {{noticeable}} carbonation (fizzy bubbles) and a typical alcohol by volume content of around 5%. The Pilsner Urquell, Bitburger, and Heineken brands of beer are typical examples of pale <b>lager,</b> as are the American brands Budweiser, Coors, and Miller.|$|E
5|$|Previous kit {{sponsors}} include Newcastle Breweries (1980–86), Greenall's Beers (1986–90), McEwan's <b>Lager</b> and Newcastle Brown Ale (1990–2000), NTL (2000–03), Northern Rock (2003–12), and Virgin Money (2012–13).|$|E
5000|$|Brands {{produced}} {{are mainly}} pale <b>lagers</b> of varying strengths ranging from 0.5% abv to 7% and include Carlsberg, O.K. Beer, Signature, Mocne, and Karmi. The brewery produces two dark <b>lagers,</b> Palone (5.5%) and Porter (8.3%).|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the structural relaxation of micronized fluticasone propionate (FP) under different <b>lagering</b> conditions and its influence on aerodynamic particle size distribution (APSD) of binary and tertiary carrier-based dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulations. Micronized FP was <b>lagered</b> under low humidity (LH 25 C, 33 % RH [relative humidity]), high humidity (HH 25 °C, 75 % RH) for 30, 60, and 90 days, respectively, and high temperature (HT 60 °C, 44 % RH) for 14 days. Physicochemical, surface interfacial properties via cohesive-adhesive balance (CAB) measurements and amorphous disorder levels of the FP samples were characterized. Particle size, surface area, and rugosity suggested minimal morphological changes of the <b>lagered</b> FP samples, {{with the exception of}} the 90 -day HH (HH 90) sample. HH 90 FP samples appeared to undergo surface reconstruction with a reduction in surface rugosity. LH and HH <b>lagering</b> reduced the levels of amorphous content over 90 -day exposure, which influenced the CAB measurements with lactose monohydrate and salmeterol xinafoate (SX). CAB analysis suggested that LH and HH <b>lagering</b> led to different interfacial interactions with lactose monohydrate but an increasing adhesive affinity with SX. HT <b>lagering</b> led to no detectable levels of the amorphous disorder, resulting in an increase in the adhesive interaction with lactose monohydrate. APSD analysis suggested that the fine particle mass of FP and SX was affected by the <b>lagering</b> of the FP. In conclusion, environmental conditions during the <b>lagering</b> of FP may have a profound effect on physicochemical and interfacial properties as well as product performance of binary and tertiary carrier-based DPI formulations...|$|R
50|$|Saku Brewery {{dates back}} to 1820, making it the oldest {{commercial}} brewery in Estonia. It makes {{a wide range of}} pale <b>lagers,</b> such as the very popular Saku Originaal, and a few stronger and darker <b>lagers.</b> Since 2008, Saku has been 100% owned by the Carlsberg Group.|$|R
5|$|The temperance {{movement}} {{remained a}} strong influence though, and when new breweries were set up, the outcry led to the Welsh Sunday Closing Act in 1881, an act that forced the closure of public houses in Wales on a Sunday. Wales' passion for beer remained; the Wrexham <b>Lager</b> Beer Company opened in 1881, as the first <b>lager</b> producer in Britain. The Felinfoel Brewery {{made a deal with}} the local tin works and became the first brewery in Europe to put beer in cans.|$|E
5|$|Beer colour is {{determined}} by the malt. The most common colour is a pale amber produced from using pale malts. Pale <b>lager</b> and pale ale are terms used for beers made from malt dried with the fuel coke. Coke was first used for roasting malt in 1642, {{but it was not until}} around 1703 that the term pale ale was used.|$|E
5|$|Dark beers {{are usually}} brewed from a pale malt or <b>lager</b> malt base {{with a small}} {{proportion}} of darker malt added to achieve the desired shade. Other colourants—such as caramel—are also widely used to darken beers. Very dark beers, such as stout, use dark or patent malts that have been roasted longer. Some have roasted unmalted barley.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being the}} {{dominant}} presence in Scottish brewing for around a century, the McEwan's brands were neglected by Scottish & Newcastle, who concentrated on their global brands. The McEwan's ales were eclipsed by John Smith's Bitter and Belhaven Best and cask-conditioned beers such as Deuchars IPA, whilst the <b>lager</b> fell behind Tennent's.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the John Smith's brands {{included}} Yorkshire Bitter, Magnet Pale Ale, Export Pale, Sweet Stout, Double Brown and Magnet Old. In December 1983, John Smith's Cask (3.8% ABV) was re-introduced, {{seven years}} after it had been phased out. By June 1985, John Smith's produced 1.7 million hectolitres of beer annually. In November that year, a new brewhouse was opened, {{at the cost of}} £5 million. Production of Foster's <b>lager</b> began in 1987.|$|E
5|$|In Ghana, FES is brewed in Kumasi by Guinness Ghana Breweries, {{which is}} 50.5 per cent owned by Diageo. GFE {{is mixed with}} a locally brewed sorghum <b>lager,</b> but it differs from the Nigerian version in that it {{contains}} no wheat and has {{a higher proportion of}} roast barley. In Ghana, the product is believed to have medicinal properties, strengthening the blood and improving circulation.|$|E

5|$|Regional geology accords that Dublin's {{hard water}} is well-suited to making stout, such as Guinness, while the Plzeň Region's soft water {{is ideal for}} brewing Pilsner (pale <b>lager),</b> such as Pilsner Urquell. The waters of Burton in England contain gypsum, which {{benefits}} making pale ale {{to such a degree}} that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as Burtonisation.|$|E
5|$|Stout, {{a kind of}} porter beer, {{particularly}} Guinness, {{is typically}} associated with Ireland, although historically it was more closely associated with London. Porter remains very popular, although it has lost sales since the mid-20th century to <b>lager.</b> Cider, particularly Magners (marketed in the Republic of Ireland as Bulmers), is also a popular drink. Red lemonade, a soft-drink, is consumed on its own and as a mixer, particularly with whiskey.|$|E
5|$|The brewery brews 3.8 million hectolitres {{annually}} (1.8 {{million of}} which is John Smith's beer), and employed around 300 people in 2008. It has two keg lines, two bottle lines and one canning line. It currently brews and packages the ale brands John Smith's Original, John Smith's Extra Smooth and Newcastle Brown Ale, and the <b>lager</b> brands Foster's, Kronenbourg 1664, Amstel and Tiger.|$|E

5|$|The {{last of the}} company's dray horses was {{retired in}} 1947. Horses had {{delivered}} beer to all the areas surrounding the brewery, as far afield as Pateley Bridge. From 1948 the company exported beer to Belgium where it was bottled and distributed by Tilkens brewery. In 1950 {{there was a general}} strike in Belgium, and John Smith's hired two Handley Page Halifax heavy bomber aircraft to carry 7 ton loads twice-daily of their beers into the country in order to ensure supply. In 1953 the firm became a public company, with fixed assets of around £5 million, 1,000 licensed premises and around 1,100 employees. In 1958, Whitworth, Son & Nephew of Wath-upon-Dearne was acquired with 165 licensed houses, and the brewery was immediately closed down. In 1959 the company began to bottle imported Alken <b>lager</b> at Tadcaster, in response to growing customer demand. In 1961 the company also began to bottle Carlsberg <b>lager.</b> By 1960 the company had an estate of 909 public houses.|$|E
5|$|The {{temperature}} of a beer has {{an influence on}} a drinker's experience; warmer temperatures reveal the range of flavours in a beer but cooler temperatures are more refreshing. Most drinkers prefer pale <b>lager</b> to be served chilled, a low- or medium-strength pale ale to be served cool, while a strong barley wine or imperial stout to be served at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|Andjar {{was born}} Abisin Abbas in Alahan Panjang, West Sumatra, on 26February 1902. He gravitated toward {{traditional}} theatre {{at a young}} age after visits from the wandering Wayang Kassim and Juliana Opera stambul troupes; he pretended to act with his friends in stage plays which they had seen. After completing his formal education up to the Meer Uitgebreid <b>Lager</b> Onderwijs (junior high school) level– first in Malay-language schools then Dutch ones– he moved to Batavia (modern-day Jakarta). He worked as a reporter for two daily newspapers, Bintang Timoer and Bintang Hindia; he may have also worked on a farm.|$|E

After completing his studies some two years later, he entered a formal relationship with his cousin from his mother's side, Aja (also Aje) Bun. Husny writes that the two were arranged to be married by their parents, while Dini casts the relationship as a vow to be always faithful. As his parents permitted him to finish his studies in Java, Amir moved to the colonial capital at Batavia (now Jakarta) to complete his studies.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Boddingtons {{bought the}} Oldham Brewery for £23million, hoping to combine Oldham's {{strength}} in <b>lager</b> and keg bitter {{with their own}} expertise in cask ales. After the acquisition, the company owned 272 public houses, 70 per cent of which were within 20 miles of its Manchester brewery. In 1983, Boddingtons Bitter was distributed in the Home Counties for the first time. In 1985 Boddingtons paid £27.5million for the 160,000 barrel capacity Higsons Brewery in Liverpool and its tied estate of 160 public houses to form a combine with a £65million turnover. The Guardian commented {{that the company had}} paid mere asset value for Higsons as the company had been reporting poor profits. There was virtually no overlap between the two companies, and the takeover brought Boddingtons to Merseyside for the first time. By this time Strangeways was producing only two beers, a bitter and a mild, with bitter constituting over 90 per cent of production. In 1986, the company employed 280 people and operated 530 tied houses, and while Strangeways Brewery had a capacity of 500,000 barrels a year, it was operating at around 50 per cent capacity. That year the company introduced its own <b>lager,</b> brewing Kaltenberg under licence.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} when Akhmad Bassah was born, {{though he is}} thought to have been raised in Bandung, western Java, where he graduated from a Meer Uitgebreid <b>Lager</b> Onderwijs. Bassah spent time working on the state-operated railroad, apparently rising to a fairly high position, but was fired for organizing a strike of the Union of Train and Tramway Personnel. Although he left the company, Bassah remained active in social movements. He was {{an active member of the}} Sarekat Rakyat (People's Union), an organization with communist leanings, and helped that group in its mission of social service.|$|E
