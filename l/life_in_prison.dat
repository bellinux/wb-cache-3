5|$|Garza, {{troubled by}} what he had done, confessed to the police that he acted as a {{middleman}} in Fischer's murder.

She was convicted again in 1998 by a federal court and sentenced to <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>prison.</b> Martínez was given a 20-year sentence after pleading guilty and testifying against the two in court. Though U.S. officials tried to have the two assassins extradited, the hitmen never faced trial in Texas. They were prosecuted in Mexico and given a 15-year sentence.|$|E

Although these points were raised at the trial, Ravoahangy was sentenced to death, along with Raseta and four other nationalists, while Rabemananjara was sentenced to <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>prison.</b> In July 1949, the convicts' death sentences were commuted to <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>prison,</b> and the trio remained imprisoned until they were granted amnesty in 1958.
