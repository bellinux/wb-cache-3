40|$|ABSTRACTThe impact <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> on {{expected}} {{returns from}} Brazilian corporate bondsThis study aims {{to identify the}} impact <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk on expected excess returns of Brazilian corporate bonds in the secondary market. We performed a battery of regression analysis with semiannual unbalanced panel data for 101 securities over eight semesters (first semester of 2006 to {{the second half of}} 2009), totaling 382 observations. Seven proxies (bid/ask spread, %zeroreturns, age, amount outstanding, face value, number of bonds, and %time) were used to test the impact <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk in the yield spreads. Ten other variables (Slope Factor, Credit Risk Factor, risk-free rate, rating, duration, four accounting variables, and equity volatility) were used as yield spread determinants. The null hypothesis that there is no liquidity premium for bonds in the Brazilian secondary market was rejected for only three proxies (bid/ask spread, face value, and number of bonds). The premiums observed were quite small (1. 9 basis points for each 100 -basis-point increase in the bid/ask spread, 0. 5 basis point to 1 % face value increase, and 0. 17 basis point for each issue of at least 1000 bonds). In both cases we observed a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> proxies following correction for autocorrelations and potential endogeneity, either through the inclusion of fixed effects, first differences analysis, or simultaneous equation analysis. These results point to the fact that liquidity risks may not be of great importance to the expectations of the Brazilian corporate bond secondary market...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the efficiency of}} financial intermediation and the propagation of business cycle shocks in a model of long-term relationships between entrepreneurs and lenders lenders may be constrained in their short-run access to liquidity. When liquidity is low, relationships are subject to breakups that lead to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> joint surplus. <b>Liquidity</b> outflows cause damage to financial structure by breaking up relationships, and damage persists due to frictions {{in the formation of}} new relationships. Feedbacks between aggregate investment and the structure of intermediation greatly magnify the effects of shocks. For large shocks, financial collapse may become inescapable in the absence of external intervention. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{includes two}} chapters on topics related to market microstruc- ture and high frequency trading. In the first chapter, I explore {{the effects of}} speed differences among front-running high frequency traders (HFTs) in a model of one round of trading. Traders differ in speed and their speed differences matter. I model strategic interactions induced when HFTs have different speeds in an extended Kyle (1985) framework. HFTs are assumed to anticipate incoming orders and trade rapidly to exploit normal-speed traders' latencies. Upon observing a common noisy signal about the incoming order flow, faster HFTs react more quickly than slower HFTs. I find that these front-running HFTs effectively levy a tax on normal-speed traders, making markets less liquid and prices ultimately less informative. Such negative effects on market quality are more severe when HFTs have more heterogeneous speeds. Even when infinitely many HFTs compete, their negative effects in general do not vanish. I analyze policy proposals concerning HFTs and find that (1) lowering the frequency of trading reduces {{the negative impact of}} HFTs on market quality and (2) randomizing the sequence of order execution can degrade market quality when the randomizing interval is short. Consistent with empirical findings, a small number of HFTs can generate a large fraction of the trading volume and HFTs' profits depend on their speeds relative to other HFTs. In the second chapter, I study the effects of higher trading frequency and front-running in a dynamic model. I find that a higher trading frequency improves the informativeness of prices and increases the trading <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> driven noise traders. When the trading frequency is finite, the existence of HFT front-runners hampers price efficiency and market liquidity. In the limit when trading frequency is infinitely high, however, information efficiency is unaffected by front-running HFTs and these HFTs make all profits from noise traders who do not smooth out their trades...|$|R

The second mechanism involves investors ’ Knightian uncertainty.

The crisis impacted Danske Bank at September the 15 th 2008, which induced <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity.</b> The bank was subsequently accused of composing inferior credit ratings {{and to be}} a greedy and harsh bank. It resulted in a historic decline of Danske Bank’s image. Consequently, this thesis seeks to answer following research question: How did Danske Bank communicate through the crisis and how suitable is their strategy? Theory within this thesis regards crisis communication. Specific is Benoits and Coombs applied. Benoits theory of image-re-establishment is applied to identify the strategic communication through the crisis and Coombs theory is applied in order to analyse how suitable the used strategies are. The analysis is a chronological review of selected statements from Danske Bank’s previous managing director and Danske Bank’s conducted campaigns. Furthermore, the analysis contain empirical data in the shape of quantitative interviews. Conclusion on the research question is that Danske Bank utilized all five of Benoits’ strategies, which in some contexts, is used inopportune and have resulted in an unreliable communication through the crisis...|$|E

40|$|The pricing <b>of</b> total <b>liquidity</b> risk is {{studied in}} the {{cross-section}} of stock returns. The study {{suggests that there is}} a positive relation between total volatility <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> and expected returns. Our measure <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> is based on Amihud (2002) and its volatility is measured using daily data. Furthermore, we document that total volatility <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> is priced in the presence <b>of</b> systematic <b>liquidity</b> risk: the covariance of stock returns with aggregate <b>liquidity,</b> the covariance <b>of</b> stock <b>liquidity</b> with aggregate liquidity, and the covariance <b>of</b> stock <b>liquidity</b> with the market return. The separate pricing of total volatility <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> indicates that idiosyncratic liquidity risk is important in the cross section of returns. This result is puzzling in light of Acharya and Pedersen (2005) who develop a model in which only systematic liquidity risk affects returns. The positive correlation between the volatility <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> and expected returns suggests that risk averse investors require a risk premium for holding stocks that have high variation in liquidity. Higher variation in liquidity implies that a stock may become illiquid with higher probability {{at a time when it}} is traded. This is important for investors who face an immediate liquidity need and are not able to wait for periods <b>of</b> high <b>liquidity</b> to sell...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamic effect}} of a {{hazardous}} waste site is analyzed by investigating the causal relationship between housing appreciation rates and house location {{in relation to a}} hazardous waste site using resale data from individual sales transactions in Dallas County, Texas. The results indicate that in the period in which the hazardous waste site was identified and cleanup occurred, residential property owners in close proximity to the hazardous waste site experienced lower housing appreciation rates. In the first post-cleanup period, they gained some of the lost ground with a higher appreciation rate. In a subsequent post-cleanup period, their appreciation fell in line with property owners whose properties are located farther away from the hazardous waste site. This suggests that a long-run equilibrium has been reached since appreciation rates were not significantly different across the Dallas housing market in the second post-cleanup period. Although the results indicate that adjustment takes time, an equilibrium is eventually reached for the houses in this repeat sales data set. An important implication of our analysis is that since the post-cleanup recovery was not immediate, property owners should be compensated for their <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity...</b>|$|E

40|$|Credit {{networks}} {{represent a}} way of modeling trust between entities in a network. Nodes in the network print their own currency and trust {{each other for a}} certain amount of each other’s currency. This allows the network to serve as a decentralized payment infrastructure—arbitrary payments can be routed through the network by passing IOUs between trusting nodes in their respective currencies—and obviates the need for a common currency. Nodes can repeatedly transact with each other and pay for the transaction using trusted currency. A natural question to ask in this setting is: how long can the network sustain liquidity, i. e. how long can the network support the routing of payments before credit dries up? We answer this question in terms of the long term success probability of transactions for various network topologies and credit values. We show that a number of well-known graph families have the remarkable property that repeated transactions do not result in a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity.</b> Further, we show using simulations that the success probability of transactions in Erdös-Rényi and powerlaw networks depends only on average node degree and credit capacity, not on network size. Finally, we compare liquidity in credit networks to that in a centralized payment infrastructure and show that credit networks are not significantly less liquid; thus we do not lose much liquidity in return for their robustness and decentralized properties...|$|E

40|$|The present {{article focuses}} on the {{internal}} factors which have potential infl uence on the <b>liquidity</b> <b>of</b> the Slovenian banking sector. Unlike other studies, this paper uses multiple dependent variables, encompassing different views on liquidity and leading to higher complexity. These include the creation <b>of</b> <b>liquidity,</b> its outfl ow, net change and total reallocation, determined {{on the basis of}} a specifi c method <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> measurement – the gross liquidity fl ows. The chosen independent variables include various items of internal character such as loans, deposits, profi t, capital and the size of the bank. Robust regression analyses are performed. The results indicate that internal factors have the greatest infl uence on the creation <b>of</b> <b>liquidity,</b> where almost all the variables considered were signifi cant. Used factors do not only affect liquidity creation, often investigated by authors, but affect other dimensions <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> as well. A signifi cant item which played a role in multiple dimensions <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> was the value of loans and the size of the bank (total assets). The models have shown that any given factor only has an infl uence on the creation <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> without infl uencing its outfl ow and vice versa. Thus, when looking for determinants only for the creation or only for the outfl ow <b>of</b> <b>liquidity,</b> the results need not necessarily comprehensively show the infl uence of the given factors, and can lead to erroneous conclusions.
