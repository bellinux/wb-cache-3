One {{of the most effective}} risk mitigation actions in such disasters is emergency evacuation. This paper evaluates the dynamics of the vehicular traffic of Tehran under an evacuation condition. The main arterials of the city of Tehran are simulated by a macroscopic traffic flow simulation model (FastLane). The dynamics of traffic in the network are assessed by means of the Network Fundamental Diagram under different <b>loading</b> <b>durations.</b> Simulation results confirm the effect of <b>loading</b> <b>duration</b> and spatial spread of density on network performance. As was previously suggested in the literature, increasing <b>loading</b> <b>duration</b> leads to higher average network flow in the recovery phase compared to maximum network flow in the loading phase. Furthermore, simulation results demonstrate a clear decrease of average velocity by increasing the spatial spread of the densities in the network.

50|$|Filter {{selection}} is reliant {{on a number}} of variables such <b>load,</b> <b>duration,</b> shape, size and distribution of the substance desired to be filtered. Ideally if the medium is too large, filtrate will be of a poor quality as it will fail to collect particulates within its matrix. Conversely if the medium is very small, solids will accumulate {{on the surface of the}} cartridge causing close to immediate blockages. In regards to the shape using grains that are round in shape have the tendency to erode due to the pressure the inlet stream may possess on the system, whereas grains that are flat (may increase surface area) however may float out of the system during backwash. Particles which are high on Moh’s scale of hardness and have a relatively large specific gravity are often recommended to be used as particle media. The softer and lighter the material is, the more susceptible it is to erosion and fluidisation. Thus particles such as silica and sand are often used as they are affordable however are resistant to the high flows of the incoming fluid.The uniformity coefficient is a measure of the uniformity of the material used within the filter. It is a ratio of a sieve pore that allows 60% of the material through in comparison to a pore size that allows 10% of material through. The closer the ratio is to one, means the closer the particles are in size. An ideal system would have a coefficient between 1.3 and 1.5 and must not exceed 1.7. Anything less than 1.3 is an indication that it is unnecessary to the system and may result in higher costs without providing any additional form of optimisation. Beyond 1.5 indicates that the system may experience a greater pressure drop and as mentioned may result in clogging, seeping of waste flow and reduced filtration rate.As a guideline it is recommended that the smallest particles used within depth filters should be placed at least 150 mm from the outlet stream to prevent fluidisation.|$|E

The aims of grid development studies are firstly to locate the needs for grid reinforcement, then to elaborate a reinforcement strategy and finally to promote the profitability of this reinforcement. This study is about the last step of grid development studies: benefits calculation. The profitability of grid development studies is estimated by comparing grid investment costs and failure costs modelled by the energy not supplied. <b>Load</b> <b>duration</b> curves are {{used to calculate the}} energy not supplied due to transmission limitations and therefore to promote the profitability of grid developments (new transmission facilities…). Current <b>load</b> <b>duration</b> curves come from a catalogue created in the early nineties which identifies nine consumption profiles. The aim {{of this study was to}} decide whether this catalogue is still valid or not, and, if this catalogue is no longer valid, to elaborate a new catalogue or a homemade software to create on demand, i. e. “à la carte”, <b>load</b> <b>duration</b> curves or load curves for every studied area. Firstly, current catalogue relevance has been analyzed through comparisons with real measured <b>load</b> <b>duration</b> curves of fourteen areas which showed its inadequacy. Then, the study of the real measured <b>load</b> <b>duration</b> curves proved that an accurate catalogue including all the existing load profiles would require a huge number of parameters to describe it. Therefore, a new simple catalogue could be enough to model load profiles on large areas for large scale studies but not for local studies. For these last ones, on demand <b>load</b> <b>duration</b> curves would be preferred to have an appropriate detailed and realistic description of local load behaviour. Finally, a simple method and software to create <b>load</b> <b>duration</b> curves or load curves for every studied area has been developed.

40|$|Abstract—In {{power system}} studies, {{seasonal}} <b>load</b> <b>duration</b> curve (LDC) {{plays an important}} role in medium term horizon power system planning, reliability and energy markets studies, and economic analysis of electric power systems. Therefore, finding a simple and accurate model to forecast LDC is beneficial to network operators as well as market participants. This paper proposes a new framework to forecast seasonal LDC. As there are few contributions regarding forecasting curve time series, we redefine the problem of forecasting LDCs into a vector forecasting problem. In fact, we divide LDCs into three parts, and then, artificial neural network (ANN) engines are used to forecast future values of the three parts. The load data of Alberta electricity market from 2000 to 2013 is used to verify validity of the proposed method.
