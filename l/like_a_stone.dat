25|$|Early {{steps in}} the {{development}} of intellectual thought in ancient Greece belonged to Ionians from their well-known city of Miletus in Asia Minor. Miletus was placed favourably to absorb aspects of Babylonian knowledge and to profit from the expanding commerce of the Mediterranean. The earliest ancient Greek who is said to have constructed a map of the world is Anaximander of Miletus (c. 611–546 BC), pupil of Thales. He believed that the earth was a cylindrical form, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> pillar and suspended in space. The inhabited part of his world was circular, disk-shaped, and presumably located on the upper surface of the cylinder.|$|E

2500|$|... "The Enemy {{are driving}} us", Bee exclaimed to Jackson. Jackson, a former U.S. Army officer and {{professor}} at the Virginia Military Institute, {{is said to have}} replied, [...] "Then, Sir, we will give them the bayonet." [...] Bee exhorted his own troops to re-form by shouting, [...] "There is Jackson standing <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> wall. Let us determine to die here, and we will conquer. Rally behind the Virginians." [...] This exclamation was the source for Jackson's (and his brigade's) nickname, [...] "Stonewall". There is some controversy over Bee's statement and intent, which could not be clarified because he was mortally wounded almost immediately after speaking and none of his subordinate officers wrote reports of the battle. Major Burnett Rhett, chief of staff to General Johnston, claimed that Bee was angry at Jackson's failure to come immediately to the relief of Bee's and Bartow's brigades while they were under heavy pressure. Those who subscribe to this opinion believe that Bee's statement was meant to be pejorative: [...] "Look at Jackson standing there <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> wall!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Jackson rose to {{prominence}} and earned {{his most famous}} nickname at the First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas) on July 21, 1861. As the Confederate lines began to crumble under heavy Union assault, Jackson's brigade provided crucial reinforcements on Henry House Hill, demonstrating the discipline he instilled in his men. Brig.

2500|$|In 1981, Cetera {{released}} his first solo album, Peter Cetera, on Warner Bros. Records, after personally buying the rights from his previous contract with Columbia Records, {{who would not}} release the project. The album, which peaked at number 143 on the Billboard 200, was considered a commercial failure, which Cetera attributed to Warner Bros.' refusal to promote him as a solo artist {{out of fear that}} he would leave Chicago, who had only recently signed with the label. Former bandmate Danny Seraphine agrees with Cetera on this point, and says that the album [...] "...sank <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> due to lack of record company support.

2500|$|The English poet Geoffrey Chaucer wrote a work {{sometime}} around 1380 {{in which the}} poet himself is carried by an eagle up into the sky, near to the stars, to {{a place called the}} House of Fame, where he finds ancient writers and poets such as Orpheus and Simon Magus still living. The eagle then takes Geoffrey to a strange building built of [...] "twigges" [...] that revolves so frighteningly that the poet fears that even the eagle will have difficulty landing him safely into it; the building flies through the air <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> ball from a siege engine. But the eagle carries Geoffrey safely into this revolving house and the poem ends in an ellipsis.|$|E

2500|$|NZM had a {{very small}} circulation—no more, in JM Fischer’s estimate, than 1500–2000 readers. Virtually the only {{response}} was a letter of complaint to Franz Brendel, the editor of NZM, from Mendelssohn’s old colleague Ignaz Moscheles and ten other professors at the Leipzig Conservatory, requesting that Brendel resign from the Conservatory's board. (Brendel had taught music history at the Conservatory since 1846.) [...] Apart from Moscheles' letter, Fischer has found virtually no other substantial response.

[...] Drexler's colleague Ralph Merkle has noted that, contrary to widespread legend, Drexler never claimed that assembler systems could build absolutely any molecular structure. The endnotes in Drexler's book explain the qualification [...] "almost": [...] "For example, a delicate structure might be designed that, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>stone</b> arch, would self-destruct unless all its pieces were already in place. If there were no room in the design for the placement and removal of a scaffolding, then the structure might be impossible to build. Few structures of practical interest seem likely to exhibit such a problem, however." ...|$|E

2500|$|Aqua Skoot: Invented by Ken Bailey in {{the early}} 1980s, riders would carry a hard, solid plastic sled {{up to the top}} of the ride, go down a slide {{consisting}} of rollers akin to those found in factories, warehouses, or assembly lines, and end up in a pool that in most areas was no deeper than a puddle. The idea of the ride was to, once the sled hit the water, skip across the water <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>stone.</b> In order to do this the rider had to be in a certain position, leaned back. If the rider was not in this position, the sled would sink into the water as soon as it hit the pool, flinging the rider off head-first, which often resulted in head injuries. Other times, riders would be leaving the pool only to have others crash into them as they were riding. This ride consisted of parallel slides originally. [...] At some point in the mid 1980s, a third slide was added. Each slide was 30' long. [...] The slides were removed when Intrawest took over the resort in 1998, the pool was redesigned into the Lost Island River which is part of the children's section. [...] The platform / tower riders climbed to ride the Aqua Skoot became the Treetop Cabanas in 2003.|$|E
2500|$|Beurling was a {{committed}} Christian, teetotaler, and non-smoker; while his counterparts patronized the local bars every night, he dedicated himself totally {{to the art}} of aerial combat. Tending to be a loner on the ground and in the air, Beurling angered his commanders with his disdain for teamwork. His relentless concentration on aerial fighting led Beurling to develop a marked skill at deflection shooting and together with his [...] "situational awareness", he was soon recognised as a deadly fighter pilot. Like many successful Spitfire pilots, Beurling developed the habit of only engaging enemy aircraft at 250yards or less — a range at which many other pilots would be breaking away. Beurling owed his spectacular success to remarkably good eyesight and the ability to [...] "toss his Spitfire" [...] into violent combat manoeuvres. If jumped from behind, he would pull back on the stick of his Mk VC Spitfire so hard that the aircraft would enter a violent stall, flick over and spin. This was a hard, sudden and very dangerous act for the enemy fighter on his tail to follow. Beurling would also ram both ailerons and rudder into a sudden and violent turn, causing his Spitfire to flip over and drop <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>stone.</b> Only a very experienced (or crazy) pilot would pull such stunts more than once or twice. Beurling made them a matter of habit. He knew that the Spitfire could be nursed out of such self-induced trouble and get him home safely.|$|E
