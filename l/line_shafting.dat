500|$|During {{the early}} to mid-19th century there were several periods of {{depression}} and prosperity in the cotton trade. In this period, A & G Murray would have been less affected by these changes due {{to the size of}} the firm. In 1817, engineers William Fairbairn and his partner James Lillie updated the complex. [...] The contract, Fairbairn's first as a millwright, involved the replacement of <b>line</b> <b>shafting</b> in the complex, with wrought iron line-shafting designed to work at higher speeds. Adam Murray died in 1818 and his brother George continued to run the firm. By 1818, the firm had nearly tripled in value since 1809 to £59,000.|$|E

50|$|The <b>line</b> <b>shaft</b> is the {{accessory}} that enables a steam engine to drive {{more than one}} tool. The <b>line</b> <b>shaft</b> first appeared back in 1936 when Geoffrey Malins took {{on the task of}} making a set of engines for Hobbies of Dereham, after Geoffrey Bowman-Jenkins left Bowman models. The early <b>line</b> <b>shafts</b> all featured flatbases and, before the war, came in two models: the C1 and the C2; the former having 4 pulleys and the latter having 7. Both types of <b>line</b> <b>shaft</b> carried the Meccano-type red pulleys as well as turned brass types. The pedestal supports, like those of the early tools, were made from cast iron and the baseplates were drilled to fit Meccano. Production of the <b>line</b> <b>shaft</b> and the tools continued right up to the beginning of Second World War, possibly into 1940, the <b>line</b> <b>shaft</b> by then being incorporated into the SC2, 3 and 4 engines. After the war (c1948) the <b>line</b> <b>shaft</b> gained brass pulleys as well as the hammer and punch. The flat base plate was retained but the C1 <b>line</b> <b>shaft</b> was dropped. By the mid-1980s the Mamod company was in trouble; the SP1, 3 and 5 were dropped along with the separate tools and <b>line</b> <b>shaft</b> but all five components continued to be made as part of the WS workshop.|$|R
50|$|To {{overcome}} {{the distance and}} friction limitations of <b>line</b> <b>shafts,</b> wire rope systems were developed in the late 19th century. Wire rope operated at higher velocities than <b>line</b> <b>shafts</b> and were a practical means of transmitting mechanical power for a distance of a few miles or kilometers. They used widely spaced, large diameter wheels and had much lower friction loss than <b>line</b> <b>shafts,</b> and had one-tenth the initial cost.|$|R

50|$|During the Industrial Revolution, {{mechanized}} {{power generated}} by water wheels or steam engines was {{transmitted to the}} lathe via <b>line</b> <b>shafting,</b> allowing faster and easier work. Metalworking lathes evolved into heavier machines with thicker, more rigid parts. Between the late 19th and mid-20th centuries, individual electric motors at each lathe replaced <b>line</b> <b>shafting</b> as the power source. Beginning in the 1950s, servomechanisms were applied to the control of lathes and other machine tools via numerical control, which often was coupled with computers to yield computerized numerical control (CNC). Today manually controlled and CNC lathes coexist in the manufacturing industries.|$|E
50|$|Kearsley Mill is a {{good example}} of a mill that {{generated}} electricity from its own steam turbines. Powered by electricity which was generated on site, the group drive system allowed each electrical motor to drive a group of machines via <b>line</b> <b>shafting.</b>|$|E
50|$|Factory {{electrification}} revolutionized manufacturing. Unit drive, {{which means}} using a single electric motor for powering a single machine, eliminated <b>line</b> <b>shafts</b> previously used to transmit power {{from a small}} number of steam engines or hydraulic turbines. <b>Line</b> <b>shafts</b> created constraints on building arrangement that impeded the efficient flow of materials because they presented traffic barriers and required multi-story buildings for economy. It was not uncommon for large manufacturing sites to have many miles of <b>line</b> <b>shafts.</b> Electric motors were much more economical to operate than steam engines in terms of energy efficiency and operator attention. Electric motors were also lower in capital cost.|$|R

50|$|With factory {{electrification}} in {{the early}} 1900s, many line shafts began converting to electric drive. In early factory electrification only large motors were available, so new factories installed a large motor to drive <b>line</b> <b>shafting</b> and millwork.

5000|$|In {{order to}} provide power for small shops and light industry, {{specially}} constructed [...] "power buildings" [...] were constructed. Power buildings used a central steam engine and distributed power through <b>line</b> <b>shafts</b> to all the leased rooms.

5000|$|Factories were {{fitted with}} {{overhead}} line shafts providing rotary power. Short line-shaft systems were described by Agricola, connecting a waterwheel to numerous ore-processing machines. [...] While the machines described by Agricola used geared connections from the shafts to the machinery, by the 19th century, drivebelts {{would become the}} norm for linking individual machines to the line shafts. One mid 19th century factory had 1,948 feet of <b>line</b> <b>shafting</b> with 541 pulleys.|$|E
50|$|Most punch presses {{today are}} {{hydraulically}} powered. Older machines, however, have mechanically driven rams, meaning {{the power to}} the ram is provided by a heavy, constantly rotating flywheel. The flywheel drives the ram using a Pitman arm. In the 19th century, the flywheels were powered by leather drive belts attached to <b>line</b> <b>shafting,</b> which in turn ran to a steam plant. In the modern workplace, the flywheel is powered by an electric motor.|$|E
50|$|The mill was {{powered by}} a low breastshot water wheel, 5 ft in {{diameter}} driving the machinery through <b>line</b> <b>shafting.</b> There are currently 15 looms in total, 10 Tappet looms dating to 1890-1932, 3 Dobby looms dating to the 1950s and 2 1960s Hattersley looms acquired in 1972. These days the looms are powered by individual electric motors. In addition there is a warping mill and winding frames also dating from the 1890s.|$|E

5000|$|In 1897, Heisler {{received}} {{a patent on}} a three-truck locomotive. [...] As with Class C Shay locomotives, the tender rode on the third truck. Unlike the Shay, Heisler's design {{did not have a}} continuous string of <b>line</b> <b>shafting</b> running the length of the engine. Instead, the tender truck was driven by a line shaft above the shaft driving the main engine trucks, connected to it through spur gears. This patent also covered use of a 4-cylinder 'vee four' cylinder configuration.|$|E
50|$|Kentmere Reservoir, {{situated}} {{north of}} Staveley beyond Kentmere village, {{was built by}} the mill owners to regulate {{the flow of the}} river for the benefit of mills and other industries downstream. A large water wheel powered the <b>line</b> <b>shafting</b> (some of which can be seen upstairs in Wilf’s Café) and under the balcony can be seen where the water was drawn off above the weir and channelled along the race, through an archway into the building to power the wheel. In 1902 the water-wheel was replaced by a turbine.|$|E
