50|$|A {{switched-mode}} {{power supply}} (switching-mode power supply, switch-mode power supply, switched power supply, SMPS, or switcher) is an electronic power supply that incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power efficiently. Like other power supplies, an SMPS transfers power from a DC or AC source (often mains power) to DC loads, such as a personal computer, while converting voltage and current characteristics. Unlike a <b>linear</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> the pass transistor of a switching-mode supply continually switches between low-dissipation, full-on and full-off states, and spends very little time in the high dissipation transitions, which minimizes wasted energy. Ideally, a {{switched-mode power supply}} dissipates no power. Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of on-to-off time. In contrast, a <b>linear</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in the pass transistor. This higher power conversion efficiency is an important advantage of a switched-mode power supply. Switched-mode power supplies may also be substantially smaller and lighter than a linear supply due to the smaller transformer size and weight.|$|E

The first chargers were <b>linear</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> but they quickly moved to the cost effective ringing choke converter (RCC) SMPS topology, when new levels of efficiency were required. Recently, the demand for even lower no-load power requirements in the application has meant that flyback topology is being used more widely; primary side sensing flyback controllers are also helping to cut the bill of materials (BOM) by removing secondary-side sensing components such as optocouplers.|$|R
50|$|The first Bulgarian-made {{personal}} computer, IMKO-1, was {{a prototype}} of the Pravetz computers that were developed by Ivan Vassilev Marangozov, who was rightfully accused of cloning the Apple II.

As on the earlier S-100 bus, {{the section of the}} power supply that power the card slots is unregulated. Each card has on-board regulators for its own requirements, thus reducing power consumption on a partially loaded PEB and allowing for future expansion cards which might have unusual voltage requirements.|$|E
50|$|The {{computer}} {{consists of}} a thick aluminium chassis separated into left and right compartments with a plywood cover which sat {{on the top and}} draped over the left and right sides. (It is {{one of only a handful}} of computers to be sold in a wooden cabinet. Later versions featured an all-metal case which met safety standards.) The rear section of the compartment on the right held a <b>linear</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> including a large transformer and power capacitors, comprising much of the bulk and weight of the system. The empty section in front of the power supply normally housed one or two floppy disk drives, placed on their side so the slots were vertical. The compartment on the left held the S-100 motherboard, rotated so the slots ran left-right. Although a few logic circuits were on the motherboard, primarily for I/O functions, both the processor and the memory resided in separate daughterboards.|$|E
50|$|This {{standby voltage}} is {{generated}} by a smaller power supply inside the unit. In older PSU designs, {{it was used to}} supply the voltage regulator, located on the low-voltage side of the transformer, allowing the regulator to measure output voltages. The regulator controls the switching transistors insulated by optocouplers or pulse transformers. The standby power source was a small <b>linear</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> with conventional transformer, which was later changed to a switching power supply, sharing some components of the main unit due to cost- and energy-saving requirements. This 5VSB (Five Volts StandBy) power output feeds devices operating in standby or power off {{is generated by}} this small circuit, which replaced a small conventional transformer or startup circuit for the main voltage regulator, until it can generate power output, in some designs feeding itself and substituting the 5VSB. For this reason, a detected shoutcut may cause to wait up to an hour, until it can successful power up again. This meantime is defined by the grid side located filter capacitors have been discharged by the installed bleeding resistors.|$|E

50|$|Components used in {{the audio}} signal path {{included}} common logic still available today, as well as high-performance audio chips from companies like PMI, SSM, Analog Devices, Burr-Brown, National Semiconductor, Maxim Integrated Products, and others. An Audio Mainframe was populated with one Master audio module and up to 28 I/O audio modules. The Mix Controller's Master module controlled the Master audio module, {{and each of the}} Mix Controller's I/O modules controlled four I/O audio modules. Communication between the Mix Controller and the Audio Mainframe was via a 1 Mbit/s link for each module in the Mix Controller. Since the communications link between the Mix Controller and the Audio Mainframe was strictly a digital control interface without any audio signals, the Audio Mainframe could be positioned a large distance from the Mix Controller. This was very helpful from an acoustic standpoint, as the fans required to cool the Audio Mainframe were noticeably loud. Additionally, since the circuitry in the audio modules could be arranged completely independently of the constraints imposed by a conventional mixer's control surface, the Audio Module was able to achieve some of the best (analog) audio specifications ever seen in this type of product. The Audio Mainframe consumed around 2.5 kW in operation from its dedicated <b>linear</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b>|$|E

50|$|In a {{switched-mode}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (SMPS), the AC {{mains input}} is directly rectified and then filtered {{to obtain a}} DC voltage. The resulting DC voltage is then switched on and off at a high frequency by electronic switching circuitry, thus producing an AC current that will pass through a high-frequency transformer or inductor. Switching occurs {{at a very high}} frequency (typically 10 kHz â 1 MHz), thereby enabling the use of transformers and filter capacitors that are much smaller, lighter, and less expensive than those found in <b>linear</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> operating at mains frequency. After the inductor or transformer secondary, the high frequency AC is rectified and filtered to produce the DC output voltage. If the SMPS uses an adequately insulated high-frequency transformer, the output will be electrically isolated from the mains; this feature is often essential for safety.|$|R

40|$|The current {{state-of-the-art}} {{power saving}} designs progressively evolve, boosted by the notable advancements in microelectronics technologies. However, due to scaling in {{size of the}} electrodes in the modern biomedical implants, high-voltage power supplies (some 5 - 20 V) are necessitated for electrodes actuation purposes while most the implantable electronic sub-systems are operating under low-voltage power supplies (3 V) generated by linear regulators with degenerated power efficiency. Therefore, on system point of view, modern techniques on power saving fall far behind the system level requirements and will have reliability issues in the specific applications such as biomedical implants. The major challenge in our research presented in this thesis is the design of linear power supplies with current recycling capabilities and is required to cope with high-voltage stimulus power supply. For an implantable device, the <b>linear</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> circuit is characterised to have low power dissipation, small real-estate and reliable as well as stable operation under wide range of power supply voltages. In this thesis, we propose a current recycling technique in linear regulators for biomedical implants. The unique technology allows linear regulators being stacked, dividing the high-voltage power supply domain into several low-voltage supply domains; current can be recycled between these power supplies by having a current recycling node and power efficiency in the low-voltage powered circuits can be enhanced. Linear regulators are designed such that they both have series and shunt regulation capabilities.

Size and weight of the device was largely determined by the transformer, which in turn {{was determined by the}} power output and mains frequency. Ratings over a few watts made the devices too large and heavy to be physically supported by a wall outlet. The output voltage of these adapters varied with load; for equipment requiring a more stable voltage, linear voltage regulator circuitry was added. Losses in the transformer and the linear regulator were considerable; efficiency was relatively low, and significant power dissipated as heat even when not driving a load.|$|R
50|$|The prime {{purpose of}} foldback current {{limiting}} in <b>linear</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> {{is to keep}} the output transistor within its safe power dissipation limit.With a linear voltage regulator, the output voltage Vout and output current Iout are maintained by simply dissipating away the surplus of input voltage Vin:Under overload conditions the output voltage falls and so the difference Vin - Vout becomes larger, tending to increasing dissipation. For a simple current limit, safely handling the worst-case scenario (a short circuit) would therefore require a much larger heatsink and output transistor than would be required under normal operating conditions. Foldback partially solves this, helping to keep the normal-rated output transistor within its safe operating area under fault and overload conditions. Foldback also significantly reduces the power dissipation in the load in fault conditions, which can reduce the risks of fire and heat damage.|$|R
