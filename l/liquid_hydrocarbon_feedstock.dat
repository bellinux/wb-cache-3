Marysville {{is also home to}} Marysville Hydrocarbons, site of a recently completed ethanol plant near the southern city border. Marysville has a growing industrial park, which includes an auto parts (previously Chrysler) factory, an addition to the MOPAR parts distribution center. In 1973, Consumers Energy built a synthetic gas plant near Marysville Michigan. It was {{the first of its kind}} ever built. In 1973 the Marysville gas reforming plant could produce up to 100 million cubic feet of gas per day. That doubled in 1974 when a second train was brought on line, providing up to 220 million cubic feet (6.2 million cubic meters) of gas per day from 50,000 barrels/day of <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>feedstock.</b> The plant used natural gas liquids imported from Ontario via a pipeline under the St. Clair River. The gas produced was of comparable quality to natural gas. At one point, Marysville gas powered over one quarter of all Consumers Power customers in Michigan. It also helped lessen the effects felt by Consumers Power customers during the 1973 oil crisis. The plant was shut down for economic reasons in 1979. It is now the location of Marysville Hydrocarbons, an ethanol refinery. Many local corn growers and elevators truck their grain to Marysville for ethanol processing. Marysville Hydrocarbons is the only one of its kind in the immediate area.|$|E

Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) from gaseous hydrocarbon sources has shown great promises for large-scale graphene growth. However, high growth temperature, typically 1000 C, is required for such growth. Here we demonstrate a revised CVD route to grow graphene on Cu foils at low temperature, adopting solid and <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>feedstocks.</b> For solid PMMA and polystyrene precursors, centimeter-scale monolayer graphene films are synthesized at a growth temperature down to 400 C. When benzene is used as the hydrocarbon source, monolayer graphene flakes with excellent quality are achieved at a growth temperature as low as 300 C. The successful low-temperature growth can be qualitatively understood from the first principles calculations. Our work might pave a way to undemanding route for economical and convenient graphene growth. Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author...|$|R
40|$|Light olefins and diolefins such as ethylene, propylene, butenes and 1, 3 -butadiene are {{considered}} as {{the backbone of}} the petrochemical industry. They are precursors of numerous plastic materials, synthetic fibers, and rubbers. In recent years, the thermo catalytic cracking (TCC) process has been developed in our lab with the objective to selectively produce light olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene, from <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>feedstocks</b> such as petroleum naphtha and gas oils. With the continuous decline of conventional oil reserves, heavy petroleum feedstocks become essential alternatives for commercial petroleum products. However, the preliminary catalytic results in the TCC of heavy feedstock have indicated insufficient on-stream long-term stability and a high selectivity to polyaromatic hydrocarbons, which are usually considered as precursors for coke. In this dissertation, hybrid catalysts have been developed and studied with the goal of resolving the problems of stability of catalyst activity and selectivity. Several active metal species (such as Ni, Re, Ru) have been loaded on the co-catalyst component surface. These metal species are able to produce very active hydrogen species, in virtue of its steam-reforming activity, and to spill them over to the acidic sites of the main catalyst component. These hydrogen species, once transferred (or "spilt over") onto the surface of the main cracking catalyst component, might interact with the reaction intermediate being adsorbed on the acidic sites. This resulted in a decreased formation of coke precursors, and consequently, catalyst deactivation was significantly retarded. The results obtained from cracking tests on both petroleum feedstocks and model molecules indicated that the spilt-over hydrogen species had significant effects on heavy <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>feedstocks,</b> such as vacuum gas oil, and they could affect the reaction intermediates only when the latter were formed on the external surface of microporous ZSM- 5 zeolite particles. Moreover, data of the most recent work show {{that it is necessary to}} choose the ZSM- 5 zeolite (that is the cracking component of the hybrid catalyst) that has a high density of acid sites; however, its acid strength should be relatively mild in order to achieve a high total conversion and a high propylene/ethylene product ratio. These mild acid sites also lead to lower coke deposition and a lighter nature of coke thus improving the cleaning action of the hydrogen spilt-over species...|$|R

40|$|The {{chemical}} industry depends very heavily on <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>feedstocks,</b> which are presently derived almost exclusively from crude oil. Although only about {{seven percent of}} the hydrocarbons suitable for chemical processing are actually used in this way, it is already {{clear that there is}} a potential conflict between the needs of the energy sector and those of the {{chemical industry}}: they are competing for increasingly scarce <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> resources. The authors suggest that the supply of <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>feedstocks</b> to the chemical industry could be protected against the effects of changing patterns of energy use by modifying the underlying industrial structure. They have developed an approach which takes a variety of production processes (either in use or under development), compares their efficiency their consumption of different resources, etc., and finds the combination of technologies that best satisfies a particular demand while staying within the limits imposed by resource availability. This approach uses the techniques of interactive decision analysis to incorporate the unquantifiable social and political factors that must influence any development decision. By way of illustration, the method is applied to one very small part of the problem area: the different routes to the production of methanol. This report does not attempt to provide any final answer to the problem of feedstock supply, but rather to explain one possible approach to the problem and discuss some intermediate results. It is addressed not only to researchers, but also, and in particular, to all decision makers and industrial consultants facing problems of this type...|$|R

40|$|The main {{feedstocks}} for {{the production}} of oil-furnace carbon black are different kinds of <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The quality and utilization of oil-furnace carbon black mainly depends on the type of <b>liquid</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> contained in the oil feedstocks. In practice, both carbochemical and petrochemical oils are used as feedstock sources. Carbochemical oils are fractions obtained during coal tar distillation. Anthracene oil is one of these oils. Depending on the conditions of distillation, coal tars contain up to w = 18 · 10 – 2 highly aromatic fractions, which can be used as carbon black feedstock. The sulphur fraction of these oils can vary between w = 0. 5 and 0. 7 · 10 – 2, depending on the origin of the coal. The availability of carbochemical oils obtained from coal tar is largely dependent on the production of coke used in the manufacture of steel. The quantities available today are insufficient to satisfy the demand for carbon black feedstock. In addition, in highly industrialized countries, production of carbochemicaloils is declining. Although, carbochemical oils are preferred in terms of efficiency, petrochemical oils are more important in terms of quantities available, particularly in the production of furnace blacks. These are residual oils resulting either from catalytic cracking processes or from the production of olefins in steam crackers using naphtha or gas oil as raw material. Nevertheless, the choice of carbon black feedstock is not determined merely by price and efficiency, but also by specific quality criteria. However, due to their origin, the feedstocks are mixtures {{of a large number of}} individual substances and are, therefore, not easy to characterize. More than 200 different components have been recorded in the range detectable by gas chromatography. Some important components of carbon black feedstock are listed in table 1. 1 An important parameter for the evaluation of carbon black feedstock is density, since it increases with increasing aromaticity. It is also used for determination of the Bureau of Mines Correlation Index (BMCI), 2 which is obtained either from density and midboiling point, or from density andviscosity for those feedstocks which cannot be distilled completely. This index is used by the carbon black industry as an important criteria for feedstock evaluation. The sulphur fraction in feedstocks should not exceed w = 2. 5 · 10 – 2, because a higher content greatly affects the quality of carbon black, pollutes the atmosphere, and accelerates corrosion of the facility. The maximum sulphur content in the typical <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>feedstock</b> is w = 1. 2 · 10 – 2. 3. A very important factor of <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>feedstock</b> is the fraction of alkaline earth metals, especially sodium and potassium. The maximum sodium fraction may be w = 20 · 10 – 6, while the maximum potassium fraction is w = 2 · 10 – 6. The maximum fraction of asphalthenes is w = 15 · 10 – 2. Asphalthenes, determined as pentane-insoluble matter, provide indications concerning the possibility of grit formation. Another very important factor is the temperature range of distillation, which should be low enough, because the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>feedstock</b> must evaporize before entering the hot region of the reactor. The viscosity, the pour point, and for safety reasons, the flash point determines the handling properties and storage conditions of the feedstock. In addition, the water fraction in the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>feedstock</b> is one of the most important factors. The water fraction in <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>feedstock</b> influences the handling properties of the same. The maximum water fraction in <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>feedstock</b> may be w = 2. 0 · 10 – 2, and desirably below w = 1. 0 · 10 – 2. A higher water fraction represent a considerable impact on the financial construction. Also, it is very difficult to manipulate such feedstock, especially unloading, and in the production of oil-furnace carbon black. Namely, every water fraction higher than w = 2. 0 · 10 – 2 in the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>feedstock,</b> causes the phenomenon of cavitations. In the oil-furnace carbon black plant of Petrokemija d. d. Kutina, the storage tank TK 48003, was filled with 800 tons of anthracene oil. The average water fraction in the tank was w = 10 · 10 – 2. It was impossible to manipulate in the process of production, because the mentioned water fraction caused the cavitations effect. Therefore, it was necessary to decrease the water fraction to below w = 2. 0 · 10 – 2, which will be satisfactory for production. As the water and anthracene oil formed a homogeneous emulsion (similar density at all temperatures), it was impossible to manage decanting the water from the anthracene oil. Additionally, it was impossible to manage evaporation of the water from the oil by heating the whole emulsion,because the flash point of anthracene oil is in the temperature range of T = 100 to 105 °C. Distillation of the whole emulsion of 800 tons was also impossible, because there was no distillation column adequate for separating the water from the anthracene oil. Thus, the use of different demulsifiers proved as a potential solution for separating the homogeneous mixture of anthracene oil and water. Namely, demulsifiers are a special type of high molecular tensides and organic solvents, which serve for separation the water from different hydrocarbons. The most common use is in emulsions with “lighter” hydrocarbons, especially when the density is not above r= 0. 850 g cm – 3. Since the density of anthracene oil ranges from r= 1. 05 to 1. 09 g cm – 3, it was necessary to customise the conditions of application, and to choose the mostadequate demulsifier for the separation of water from anthracene oil. Therefore, we experimented with different kinds of demulsifiers in cooperation with the companies TEH PROJEKT KEMO d. o. o. and KEM PROJEKT d. o. o. In laboratory conditions, we tested five different demulsifiers with different concentrations, and their efficiency in separating the water from anthracene oil. We then chose the most adequate demulsifier, which was applied on an industrial level...|$|R
