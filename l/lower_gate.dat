5|$|The {{entrance}} {{gates and}} wall separating the gardens {{from the park}} and farmland date from 1878 and are listed at grade II. The wrought-iron gates are by Cubitt & Co., and were exhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1878. Two outer single gates and a double inner gate are supported by four sandstone piers. The outer pair of gate piers are capped by a bud-shaped device supported on scrolls; the inner pair are surmounted by a griffin and a lion, mirroring the statuary of the hall's terraces. The <b>lower</b> <b>gate</b> sections of lyre-like panels with leaf and spearhead motifs are topped with Jacobean-style arched panels. The ornate gate overthrows include shields and emblems capped with crowns, sheaves and sickles. The inner gates bear the inscription Quid retribuam domino ("What can I render to the Lord?"), while the outer gates bear the date. The wall, of brick with stone dressings, features arcading and has piers surmounted with ogee caps carved to match the tiles of the main hall tower. A further feature of the gardens to survive is a grade-II-listed sundial dating from the early 19th century, which stands {{to the rear of}} the house.|$|E
25|$|Some narrow locks (e.g. on Birmingham Canal Navigations) go even further. They have single gates at {{the lower}} end also. This speeds up passage, even though single lower gates are heavy (heavier than a single upper gate, because the <b>lower</b> <b>gate</b> is taller) and the lock has to be longer (a <b>lower</b> <b>gate</b> opens INTO the lock, it has to pass the bow or stern of an {{enclosed}} boat, and a single gate has a wider arc than two half-gates).|$|E
25|$|There {{were plenty}} of {{incidents}} with negligent lockkeepers. On September 11, 1895 at Lock 22, the boat Excelsior arrived, and tried to lock through. The lockkeeper was so drunk, he opened the <b>lower</b> <b>gate</b> paddles too early. The boat hit the mitre sill, broke in half, and sank with its 113 tons of coal. Richard A. Moore, {{the owner of the}} boat, collected over $1,300 in damages, and the lockkeeper was fired.|$|E

25|$|Gates are the {{watertight}} doors which seal off the chamber {{from the upper}} and lower pounds. Each end of the chamber is equipped with a gate, or pair of half-gates, made of oak or elm (or now sometimes steel). The most common arrangement, usually called miter gates, was invented by Leonardo da Vinci, sometime around the late 15th century. When closed, a pair meet at an angle like a chevron pointing upstream and only a very small difference in water-level is necessary to squeeze the closed gates securely together. This reduces any leaks from between them and prevents their being opened until water levels have equalised. If the chamber is not full, the top gate is secure; and if the chamber is not completely empty, the bottom gate is secure (in normal operation, therefore, the chamber cannot be open at both ends). A <b>lower</b> <b>gate</b> is taller than an upper gate, because the upper gate only has to be tall enough to close off the upper pound, while the <b>lower</b> <b>gate</b> {{has to be able to}} seal off a full chamber. The upper gate is as tall as the canal is deep, plus a little more for the balance beam, winding mechanism, etc.; the lower gate's height equals the upper gate plus the lock's rise.|$|E
25|$|From east to west, {{the first}} {{fountain}} is the Läuferbrunnen (German: Runner fountain) near the Nydegg Church on Nydeggstalden. The trough {{was built in}} 1824, but the figure dates from 1545. The Runner has moved several times since its creation, and until about 1663 {{was known as the}} Brunnen beim unteren Tor (Fountain by the <b>lower</b> <b>gate).</b> Originally the Läuferbrunnen had an octagonal trough and a tall, round column. The trough was replaced with a rectangular trough before 1757 which was replaced in 1824. The round column was replaced with the current square limestone pillar in the eighteenth or nineteenth century.|$|E
500|$|The {{east side}} of the walls emerge from Conwy Castle, but are gapped where the Chester to Holyhead road enters the town. The east side has four towers, with a postern gate and the <b>Lower</b> <b>Gate</b> both giving access to the town's quay; all of these {{features}} have been substantially altered from their original medieval appearances. The <b>Lower</b> <b>Gate,</b> equipped with twin towers and a portcullis, controlled access to both the quayside and, prior to the construction of the bridge, the ferry across the estuary. The wall here was originally only [...] high in places, and was later raised to its current height using rhyolite stone in the early 14th century.|$|E

50|$|Planar double-gate {{transistors}} employ conventional planar (layer by layer) {{manufacturing processes}} to create double-gate devices, avoiding more stringent lithography requirements associated with non-planar, vertical transistor structures. In planar double-gate transistors the drain-source channel is sandwiched between two independently fabricated gate/gate-oxide stacks. The primary challenge in fabricating such structures is achieving satisfactory self-alignment between {{the upper and}} <b>lower</b> <b>gates.</b>|$|R
500|$|These locks are {{staircase}} locks, whereby inner {{lock gate}} pairs serve {{as both the}} upper gate and <b>lower</b> <b>gate.</b> [...] The gates are the vulnerable hinged type, which, if damaged, could temporarily render the entire flight unusable. As there are separate sets of locks for upstream and downstream traffic, this system is more water efficient than bi-directional staircase locks.|$|E
500|$|A less {{commonly}} used feature of gate compensation {{is that an}} athlete's coach may make a strategic decision to request a <b>lower</b> <b>gate</b> if they have deemed that there is potential ground to be made points-wise {{at the cost of}} inrun speed. Collectively the system is known as [...] "wind/gate compensation", as points gained or lost due to the wind element are set against points gained or lost from gate changes, which is then reflected in an athlete's points score after a jump.|$|E

Reach Lode is quite deep, {{as a result of the}} surrounding land sinking, and the banks being built up. The <b>lower</b> <b>gate</b> of the entrance lock has been replaced by a guillotine gate, enabling boats up to [...] long to use it.|$|E

This daring act gave Porsche a first in class and an amazing sixth overall.|$|R
2500|$|The Untertorbrücke (German: <b>Lower</b> <b>Gate</b> bridge) is {{the oldest}} bridge in Bern still in existence. The {{original}} bridge, most likely a wooden walkway, was built in 1256 and spanned the Aare at the Nydegg Fortress. The bridge was destroyed in a flood in 1460. Within one year, construction began on a new stone bridge. The small Mariakapelle (Mary's Chapel) located {{in the side of}} the bridge column on the city side was blessed in 1467. However the bridge wasn't finished until 1490. The new bridge was [...] long with the three arches spanning , [...] and [...] The bridge was modified several times including the removal of the stone guard rails which were replaced with iron rails in 1818–19.|$|E
2500|$|The Goose Creek locks were 0.2 miles below Edwards Ferry (Lock 25), {{in section}} 51 used for traffic coming from Goose Creek on the Virginia shore. It allowed boats from the Goose Creek and Little River Navigation Company to enter. Only one Goose Creek boat was {{documented}} {{to enter the}} C canal, {{and there is no}} documentation of a C boat entering Goose Creek. The lock was eventually converted into a waste weir. The Goose Creek lock is actually a staircase lock or combine lock [...] (perhaps the only one on the C & O canal), i.e. two locks are put together with no intervening pound or basin between them, the upper gate of the lower lock being the same gate as the <b>lower</b> <b>gate</b> of the second lock.|$|E

50|$|In 1540 {{the upper}} castle burned down, but the <b>lower</b> <b>gates</b> and the donjon survived {{because they were}} {{separated}} from the upper castle by a deep ditch. The upper castle was rebuilt in the following year. During the Reformation in Zürich the St. Martin's Abbey on Zürichberg at Fluntern was demolished. Stone blocks and two bells from the abbey were brought by ox-cart to the church at Regensberg to rebuild it.|$|R
50|$|The {{two sets}} of lock gates work differently: the upper set {{operates}} via a mechanical system, while the <b>lower</b> <b>gates</b> are hydraulic. The top part of the lock chamber has sloping banks which are covered by vegetation of various types rather than by turf. An arrangement of steel rails ensure that boats stay in {{the centre of the}} lock during the rise/fall of 7 ft 7 in (2.31 m).|$|R
25|$|The 1830 design {{eliminated}} {{the use of}} culverts in the masonry, and the upper gate is below the breast wall. The advantage {{here is that the}} lock can fill faster with the wickets being in the gate, but will not swamp a boat in the lock chamber. In the 1830 design locks, the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>gates</b> are both the same height. The majority of locks on the C canal are to this specification.|$|R
2500|$|A [...] "real" [...] {{staircase}} can {{be thought}} of as a [...] "compressed" [...] flight, where the intermediate pounds have disappeared, and the upper gate of one lock is also the <b>lower</b> <b>gate</b> of the one above it. However, it is incorrect to use the terms staircase and flight interchangeably: because of the absence of intermediate pounds, operating a staircase is very different from operating a flight. It can be more useful to think of a staircase as a single lock with intermediate levels (the top gate is a normal top gate, and the intermediate gates are all as tall as the bottom gate). As there is no intermediate pound, a chamber can only be filled by emptying the one above, or emptied by filling the one below: thus the whole staircase has to be full of water (except for the bottom chamber) before a boat starts to ascend, or empty (except for the top chamber) before a boat starts to descend. By building a pair of such lock sets (one used to climb and the other to descend) these difficulties are avoided, as well as enabling a greater traffic volume and reduced wait times.|$|E
