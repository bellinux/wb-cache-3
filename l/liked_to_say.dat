[...] Knight agreed: [...] "Campbell's lecture-room manner was so unpleasant to me that I was unwilling to face it. Campbell talked {{a good deal more}} than he listened, and he <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> outrageous things." ...|$|E
500|$|Haywood seemed most {{comfortable}} with a philosophy arrived at through the hard-scrabble experiences of the workers. He {{had the ability to}} translate complex economic theories into simple ideas that resonated with working people. He distilled the voluminous work of Karl Marx into a simple observation, [...] "If one man has a dollar he didn't work for, some other man worked for a dollar he didn't get." [...] While Haywood respected the work of Marx, he referred to it with irreverent humor. Acknowledging his scars from dangerous mining work, and from numerous fistfights with police and militia, he <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "I've never read Marx's Capital, but I have the marks of capital all over me." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Paine <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that he read very little, his {{writings}} belie this statement; The Age of Reason has intellectual {{roots in the}} traditions of David Hume, Spinoza, and Voltaire. Since Hume had already made {{many of the same}} [...] "moral attacks upon Christianity" [...] that Paine popularized in The Age of Reason, scholars have concluded that Paine probably read Hume's works on religion or had at least heard about them through the Joseph Johnson circle. Paine would have been particularly drawn to Hume's description of religion as [...] "a positive source of harm to society" [...] that [...] "led men to be factious, ambitious and intolerant". More of an influence on Paine than Hume, however, was Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-politicus (1678). Paine would have been exposed to Spinoza's ideas through the works of other eighteenth-century deists, most notably Conyers Middleton. Paine would also more than likely have been familiar with Voltaire's mocking wit and the works of other deistic French philosophes.|$|E
2500|$|When World War I {{began in}} August 1914, Hoover helped {{organize}} the return of around 120,000 Americans from Europe. He led 500 volunteers in distributing food, clothing, steamship tickets and cash. [...] "I did not realize it at the moment, but on August 3, 1914, my career was over forever. I was on the slippery road of public life." [...] Hoover <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that the difference between}} dictatorship and democracy was simple: dictators organize from the top down, democracies from the bottom up.|$|E

2500|$|Ringo Starr met {{songwriter}} Dean Grakal at a {{party on}} New Year's Eve 1996, during which the pair had a discussion about songwriting, with Grakal proposing that they form a team with Mark Hudson, whom Starr had met years prior while Starr was working on Time Takes Time (1992). Starr spoke of the writing process {{in an interview with}} Billboard magazine: [...] "This is the first time I've really been involved [...] Whereas before, I'd just sort of pick out other people's songs or songs other people had written that I thought were vaguely trying to say what I would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> on this, we're really trying to say what I want to say, thank you." ...|$|E
2500|$|With age, a {{deepening}} personally spirtuality led to several elucidations and clarifications, as he untangled language problems in religion, attacking, for example, {{the temptation to}} think of God's existence {{as a matter of}} scientific evidence. In 1947, finding it more difficult to work, he wrote, [...] "I have had a letter from an old friend in Austria, a priest. In it he says that he hopes my work will go well, if it should be God's will. Now that is all I want: if it should be God's will." [...] In Wittgenstein's Culture and Value, it is found, [...] "Is what I am doing [...] really worth the effort? Yes, but only if a light shines on it from above." [...] His close friend Norman Malcolm would write, [...] "Wittgenstein’s mature life was strongly marked by religious thought and feeling. I am inclined to think that he was more deeply religious than are many people who correctly regard themselves as religious believers." [...] At last, Wittgenstein writes, [...] "Bach wrote on the title page of his Orgelbuechlein, ‘To the glory of the most high God, and that my neighbour may be benefited thereby.’ [...] That is what I would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about my work." ...|$|E
