40|$|Consider continuous-time <b>linear</b> <b>switched</b> {{systems on}} R^n {{associated}} with compact convex sets of matrices. When {{the system is}} irreducible and the largest Lyapunov exponent is equal to zero, there always exists a Barabanov norm (i. e. a norm which is non increasing along trajectories of the <b>linear</b> <b>switched</b> system together with extremal trajectories starting at every point, that is trajectories of the <b>linear</b> <b>switched</b> system with constant norm). This paper deals with two sets of issues: (a) properties of Barabanov norms such as uniqueness up to homogeneity and strict convexity; (b) asymptotic behaviour of the extremal solutions of the <b>linear</b> <b>switched</b> system. Regarding Issue (a), we provide partial answers and propose four open problems motivated by appropriate examples.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} partial {{overview of}} the mathematical synthesis and the physical realization of metasurfaces, and related illustrative examples.

The examples demonstrate {{the capabilities of the}} synthesis and realization techniques, thereby showing the plethora of possible metasurface field transmission and subsequent applications. The first example is the design of two diffraction engineering birefringent metasurfaces performing polarization beam splitting and orbital angular momentum multiplexing, respectively. Next, we discuss the concept of the "transistor" metasurface, which is an electromagnetic <b>linear</b> <b>switch</b> based on destructive interferences.

A discrete-time <b>linear</b> <b>switched</b> {{system is a}} hybrid system, such that the continuous sub-system associated with each discrete state is linear. In this paper we present necessary and sufficient conditions for an input-output map to admit a discrete-time <b>linear</b> <b>switched</b> state-space realization. The conditions are formulated as finite rank conditions of a generalized Hankel-matrix. In addition, we present a characterization of minimality of discrete-time <b>linear</b> <b>switched</b> systems in terms of reachability and observable.

40|$|Nonlinear {{systems are}} modeled as {{piecewise}} linear systems at multiple operating points, where the operating points are modeled as switches between constituent linearized systems. In this paper, adaptive piecewise <b>linear</b> <b>switch</b> controller is proposed {{for improving the}} response time and tracking performance of the hydraulic actuator control system, which is essentially piecewise linear. The controller composed of PID and Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) adaptively chooses the proportion of these two components and makes the designed system have faster response time at the transient phase and better tracking performance, simultaneously. Then, their stability and tracking performance are analyzed and evaluated by the hydraulic actuator control system, the hydraulic actuator {{is controlled by the}} electrohydraulic system, and its model is built, which has piecewise linear characteristic.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} Genetic Algorithm Optimisation Methods (GA) is studied {{and for the}} first time used to design high {{efficiency}} microwave class E power amplifiers (PAs) and associated load patch antennas. The difficulties of designing high efficiency PAs is that power transistors are highly non linear and classical design techniques only work for resistive loads. There are currently no high efficient and accurate procedures for design high efficiency PAs. To achieve simplified and accurate design procedure, GA and new design quadratic equations are introduced and applied. The performance analysis is based on <b>linear</b> <b>switch</b> models and non linear circuitry push-pull methods. The results of the analytical calculations and experimental verification showed that the power added efficiency (PAE) of the PAs mainly depend on the losses of the active device itself and are nearly independent on the losses of its harmonic networks. Hence, it has been proven that the cheap material PCB FR 4 can be used to design high efficiency class E PAs and it also shown that low Q factor networks have only a minor effect on efficiency, allowing a wide bandwidth to be obtained. In additional, a new procedure for designing class E PAs is introduced and applied. The active device (ATF 34143) is used. Good agreement was obtained between predicted analyses and the simulation results (from Microwave Office (AWR) and Agilent ADS software). For the practical realization, class E PAs were fabricated and tested using PCB FR 4. The practical results validate computer simulations and the PAE of the class E PAs are more than 71...|$|E
