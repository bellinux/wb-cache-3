The {{maximum forward current}} for dynamic avalanche breakdown is decreased with increasing supply voltage and temperature for all technologies. The CoolMOS exhibited the largest latch-up current followed by the SiC MOSFET and silicon power MOSFET; however, when expressed as current density, the SiC MOSFET comes first followed by the CoolMOS and silicon power MOSFET. For the CoolMOS, the alternating p and n pillars of the superjunctions in the drift region suppress BJT latch-up during reverse recovery by minimizing lateral currents and providing low-resistance paths for carriers. Hence, the temperature dependence of the latch-up current for CoolMOS was the lowest. The switching energy of the CoolMOS body diode is the largest because of its superjunction architecture which means the drift region have higher doping, hence more reverse charge. In spite of having a higher thermal resistance, the SiC MOSFET has approximately the same latch-up current while exhibiting the lowest switching energy because of the least reverse charge.

The accepted theories of SPAD operation are revisited and it is discovered that previously neglected minority carriers have many significant roles such as determining: after-pulsing, Dark Count Rate (DCR), bipolar “SPAD latch-up,” nonequilibrium DCR, and “quenching”. The “quenching” process is revisited and it is concluded {{that it is the}} “probability time” of ≈ 100 - 200 ps, and not the previously thought <b>latching</b> <b>current</b> that is important. SPADs are also found to have transient negative differential resistance. The new theories of SPADs are also supported by steady-state 1 D, 2 D and 3 D TCAD simulations as well as novel transient simulations and videos. It is demonstrated as possible to simulate DCR, Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE), guard ring performance, breakdown voltage, breakdown voltage variation, “quenching,” and transient operation of SPADs with great accuracy. The manufacture of SPADs is studied focusing on the operation and optimisation of guard rings and it is found that ion implantation induced asymmetry from the tilt and rotation/twist is critical. Where symmetric, guard rings fail first along the directions due to enhanced mobility. Process integration rules are outlined for obtaining high performance SPADs in CMOS while maintaining compatibility with transistors. The minimisation of tunnelling with lightly-doped junctions and the reduction of ion implantation induced defects by additional annealing are found essential for achieving low DCR.

The characteristics and theories of four-layer pnpn semiconductor devices have been considered with particular reference to the two transistor analogy of thyristor {{in order to obtain}} an expression for the current-voltage characteristics of the device. The Small-signal, low-frequency current gains of the npn and pnp transistor sections of high and low power thyristors were measured by a three terminal method originally employed by W. Fulop. The technique is shown to be applicable to measurements on high power thyristors. The current gains of two transistor component were also measured as a function of temperature at a series of anode currents. From this it can be shown that the temperature dependence of two-terminal <b>latching</b> <b>current</b> can be qualitatively estimated from the plot of current gain measured at a series of temperature for constant anode current. Analysis of instability of devices with temperature showed that-, the saturation current-of isolated centre junction plays a dominant role. Gold doping predictably leads to low current gain of the pnp transistor section. Current gain measurements of thyristors with and without shorting dot showed an. almost similar variation with frequency. For both type of devices αnpn 0 was almost equal and even closer at high temperature (1000 C). The theory of the influence of shorting dots on current flow in thyristors outlined in a report by W. Fulop, was developed. The value of IL’ hole lateral current in the p-base is found and its dependence upon p-base width and shorting dot area investigated. The voltage distribution in the two central base regions just after the device has switched on but before the plasma has had time to spread is investigated.

As far as we know, there is not any work published that justifies and formally characterizes metastable behavior in dynamic <b>latches.</b> With <b>current</b> technologies, dynamic <b>latches</b> are widely used in high-performance VLSI circuits, mainly due to their lower cost and higher operation speed than static latches. In this work, we demonstrate that dynamic memory cells present an anomalous behavior referred to as metastable operation with characteristics {{similar to those of}} static latches. We perform a suitable generalization of metastability to the dynamic case, applying it to a CMOS dynamic D-latch. A theoretical model will be proposed, allowing the quantification of metastability, and it will be validated through electric simulation with HSPICE. After that, we have compared the metastable behavior of the dynamic latch with its static counterpart, obtaining results about the characteristic parameters of metastability and the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) for both kinds of bistable circuits. These results have allowed us to conclude that, unlike metastability windows in static latches, a clearly defined input interval exists which produces an infinite resolution time. Regarding MTBF, the dynamic latch presents a very low MTBF value compared to the static latch. These results show that dynamic latches should not be used in those circuits where the risk of asynchronism between clock and data signals is not negligible.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of SiC power devices requires evaluation of benefits {{and issues of}} the technology in applications. This is important since SiC power devices are still not as mature as their silicon counterparts. This research, in its own capacity, highlights {{some of the major}} challenges and analyzes them through extensive experimental measurements which are performed in many different conditions seeking to emulate various applications scenarios. It is shown that fast SiC unipolar devices, inherently reduce the switching losses while maintain low conduction losses comparable with contemporary bipolar technologies. This translates into lower temperature excursions and an enhanced conversion efficiency. However, such high switching rates may trigger problems in the device utilizations. The switching rates influenced by the device input capacitance can cause significant ringing in the output, especially in SiC SBDs. Measurements show that switching rate of MOSFETs increases with increasing temperature in turn on and reduces in turn off. Hence, the peak voltage overshoot and oscillation severity of the SiC SBD increases with temperature during diode turn off. This temperature dependence reduces at the higher switching rates. So accurate analytical models are developed for predicting the switching energy in unipolar SiC SBDs and MOSFET pairs and bipolar silicon PiN and IGBT pairs. A key parameter for power devices is electrothermal robustness. SiC MOSFETs have already demonstrated such merits compared to silicon IGBTs, however not for MOSFET body diodes. This research has quantified this in comparison with the similarly rated contemporary device technologies like CoolMOS. In a power MOSFET, high switching rates coupled with the capacitance of drain and body causes a displacement current in the resistive path of P body, inducing a voltage on base of the parasitic NPN BJT which might forward bias it. This may lead to latch up and destruction if the thermal limits are surpassed. Hence, trade offs between switching energy and electrothermal robustness are explored for the silicon, SiC and superjunction power MOSFETs. Measurements show that performance of body diodes of SiC MOSFETs is the most efficient due to least reverse recovery. The minimum forward current for inducing dynamic latch up decreases with increasing voltage, switching rate and temperature for all technologies. The CoolMOS exhibited the largest <b>latch</b> up <b>current</b> followed by the SiC and silicon power MOSFETs. Another problem induced by high switching rates is the electrical coupling between complementing devices in the same phase leg which manifests as short circuits across the DC link voltage. This has been understood for silicon IGBTs with known corrective techniques, however it is seen that due to smaller Miller capacitance resulting from a smaller die area, the SiC module exhibits smaller shoot through currents in spite of higher switching rates and a lower threshold voltage. Measurements show that the shoot through current exhibits a positive temperature coefficient for both technologies the magnitude of which is higher for the silicon IGBT. The effectiveness of common techniques of mitigating shoot through is also evaluated, showing that solutions are less effective for SiC MOSFET because of the lower threshold voltages and smaller margins for a negative gate bias...|$|R
