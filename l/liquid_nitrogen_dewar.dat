40|$|Hypernuclear {{research}} {{will be one}} of the main topics addressed by the PANDA experiment at the planned Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research FAIR at Darmstadt (Germany). [1, 2] Thanks to the use of stored p̅ beams, copious production of double Λ hypernuclei is expected at the PANDA experiment, which will enable high precision γ spectroscopy of such nuclei for the first time, and consequently a unique chance to explore the hyperon-hyperon interaction. In particular, ambiguities of past experiments in determining the strength of the ΛΛ interaction will be avoided thanks to the excellent energy precision of a few keV (FWHM) achieved by germanium detectors. Such a resolution capability is particularly needed to resolve the small energy spacing of the order of (10 – 100) keV, which is characteristic from the spin doublet in hypernuclei the so –called “hypernuclear fine structure”. In comparison to previous experiments, PANDA will benefit from a novel technique to assign the various observable γ-transitions in a unique way to specific double hypernuclei by exploring various light targets. Nevertheless, the ability to carry out unique assignments requires a devoted hypernuclear detector setup. This consists of a primary nuclear target for the production of Ξ− + Ξ¯Ξ pairs, a secondary active target for the hypernuclei formation and the identification of associated decay products and a germanium array detector to perform γ spectroscopy. Moreover, one of the most challenging issues of this project is the fact that all detector systems need to operate in the presence of a high magnetic field and a large hadronic background. Accordingly, the need of an innovative detector concept will require dramatic improvements to fulfil these conditions and that will likely lead to a new generation of detectors. In the present work details concerning the current status of the activities related to the detector developments for this challenging programme will be given. Among these improvements is the new concept for a cooling system for the germanium detector based on a electro-mechanical device. In the present work, the cooling efficiency of such devices has been successfully tested, showing their capability to reach <b>liquid</b> <b>nitrogen</b> temperatures and therefore the possibility to use them as a good alternative to the standard <b>liquid</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>dewars.</b> Furthermore, since the momentum resolution of low momentum particles is crucial for the unique identification of hypernuclei, an analysis procedure for improving the momentum resolution in few layer silicon based trackers is presented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Devitrification, {{the process}} of {{crystallization}} of a formerly crystal-free, amorphous glass state, can lead to damage during the warming of cells. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the glass transition temperature of a cryopreservation solution typically used in the vitrification, storage and warming of mammalian oocytes and embryos using Differential Scanning Calorimetry. A numerical model of the heat transfer process to analyze warming and devitrification thresholds for a common vitrification carrier (open pulled straw, OPS) was conducted. The implications on specimen handling and storage inside the dewar in contact with nitrogen vapor phase at different temperatures were determined. The time required for initiation of devitrification of a vitrified sample was determined by mathematical modeling and compared with measured temperatures in the vapor phase of <b>liquid</b> <b>nitrogen</b> cryogenic <b>dewars.</b> Results indicated that the glass transition ranged from - 126 to - 121 ºC and devitrification was initiated at - 109 ºC. Interestingly, samples entered rubbery state at - 121 ºC and therefore could potentially initiate devitrification above this value, with the consequent damaging effects to cell survival. Devitrification times were calculated considering an initial temperature of material immersed in <b>liquid</b> <b>nitrogen</b> (- 196 ºC) and two temperatures of <b>liquid</b> <b>nitrogen</b> vapors within the dewar (- 50 and - 70 ºC) to which the sample could be exposed for a period of time, either during storage or upon its removal. The mathematical model indicated samples could reach glass transition temperatures and undergo devitrification in 30 seconds. Results of the present study indicate storage of vitrified oocytes and embryos in the <b>liquid</b> <b>nitrogen</b> vapor phase (as opposed to completely immersed in <b>liquid</b> <b>nitrogen)</b> poses the potential risk of devitrification. Due to the reduced time-handling period before samples reach critical rubbery and devitrification values, caution should be exercised when handling samples in vapor phas...|$|R

(1988) and was optimized for the analyses of halogenated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) having boiling points as low as - 128. °C (carbon tetrafluoride). The sample preconcentration cold trap consists of a U-shaped glass lined steel tube (GLT™), that is immersed into a small <b>liquid</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>Dewar</b> vessel for cooling. A rapid desorption step heats up the preconcentration tube in < 30 s from - 196 °C to 200 °C.

The design of the cold trap and the direct transfer of desorbed analytes onto the GC column via a deactivated capillary column retention gap made sample refocusing within the GC oven unnecessary. Furthermore, a special air-tight grinding device was developed in which samples ranging from soft halite (hardness 2, Mohs scale) to hard quartz (hardness 7) are effectively ground to average diameters of 1000 nm or below, thereby releasing gases from fluid inclusions of minerals.

Embryos are placed into a hypertonic solution (1. 4 – 1. 5 M) of a cryoprotective agent (CPA) such as ethylene glycol (EG) or glycerol (GLYC) to create an osmotic gradient that facilitates cellular dehydration. After embryos reach osmotic equilibrium in the CPA solution, they are individually loaded in the hypertonic CPA solution into 0. 25 ml plastic straws for freezing. Embryos are placed into a controlled rate freezer at a temperature of - 6 °C. Ice crystal formation is induced in the CPA solution surrounding the embryo, and crystallization causes an increase in the concentration of CPA outside of the embryo, causing further cellular dehydration.

Multiple devices are available, mostly based on a simple <b>liquid</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>Dewar</b> system, which have a limited freezing capacity. Argon gas-based systems ensure accurate and highly controlled freezing and have shown to be effective within the field of oncologic surgery. However, this technique has never been used {{for the treatment of}} keloid scars. Objective: This prospective study evaluates an argon gas-based system for the treatment of keloids in a patient population including all Fitzpatrick skin types with a 1 -year follow-up. Methods: Twenty-five patients with 30 keloid scars were included and treated with a device called Seednet (Galil Medical, Yokneam, Israel). Scar quality and possible scar recurrence were assessed before treatment and post treatment (6 and 12 months) with objective devices determining scar color, scar elasticity, scar volume, and patient's skin type. In addition, scars were evaluated using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale. Results: After 12 months, a significant volume reduction of 62 % was obtained, p Z 0. 05. Moreover, complaints of pain and itching were alleviated and scar quality had improved according to the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale. Scar pigmentation recovered in 62 % of all keloid scars within 12 months. Five out of 30 (17 %) scars recurred within 12 months, three of which had previously been treated with liquid nitrogen-based IL cryotherapy. Both recurrent and persistent hypopigmentation were mainly seen in Afro-American patients. Conclusions: IL cryotherapy with the use of an argon gas-based system proves to be effective in the treatment of keloid scars, yielding volume reduction and low recurrence rates. Although hypopigmentation recovered in most cases, it is strongly related to non-Caucasian patients. Finally, additional treatment of keloid scars previously unresponsive to IL cryotherapy is predisposed to a high recurrence rate. Trial number: NCT 02063243. Crow...|$|E

This detector consists of two different HPGe Germanium detectors which are placed one after the other in one detector end-cap. Both detectors are cooled by one small <b>liquid</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>dewar.</b> Seen from the window the first detector is an planar germanium detector with high resolution suitable to detect the energy lines of uranium and plutonium gamma rays in the 100 keV range. The signals of this detector are processed by a digital spectrum analyzer. The spectrum is then evaluated with the MGA/MGAU code to determine the uranium and/or plutonium isotope vector. The second detector is a coaxial detector with high efficiency for high energy gammas. Although the efficiency of this detector is considerably reduced by the presence of the planar detector in front, this detector is well suited to detect gamma radiation in the Cs/Co energy range. The signals of the detector are processed by another digital spectrum analyzer and evaluated by standard nuclide identification software. The main advantage of this system in the field of nuclear terrorism is that one mobile device is used for two measurements: uranium and plutonium identifcation and the identifcation of industrial and medical isotopes.

Upon return of the samples to Earth on October 24 by STS- 92, bubbles that spanned the diameter of the tubing were observed in all tubes. Such bubbles interrupt liquid-liquid diffusion and force vapor diffusion equilibration to occur instead. Nonetheless, crystals grew in 9 of 30 tubes. Many large crystals were grown, the largest being 2. 0 x 1. 1 x 1. 0 cubic mm. The largest crystal was used to collect data at room temperature on beamline 7 - 1 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Source to a maximum resolution of 1. 2 A. The structure was refined anisotropically using SHELX with a data to parameter ratio of 4. 5 to give an R(sub factor) of 15. 8 % (R(sub free) = 18. 2 %) for ail reflections without generated hydrogens. This refinement is proceeding. Comparisons of this 1. 2 A microgravity structure to previous reports of the thaumatin structure at 1. 75 A and to ground control crystals will be presented...|$|E
