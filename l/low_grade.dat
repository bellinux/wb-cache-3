5|$|Oil shale {{has been}} used for {{industrial}} purposes since the early 17th century, when it was mined for its minerals. Since the late 19th century, shale oil has also been used for its oil content and as a <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> fuel for power generation. However, barring countries having significant oil shale deposits, its use for power generation is not particularly widespread. Similarly, oil shale is a source for production of synthetic crude oil and it is seen as a solution towards increasing domestic production of oil in countries that are reliant on imports.|$|E
5|$|The dark slaty shales {{may have}} the {{necessary}} cleavage and hardness to be worked, and were quarried for <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> roofing slate in eastern Pennsylvania during the 19th century. The slates from the Marcellus were inferior to the Martinsburg Formation slate quarried further south, and most quarries were abandoned, with the last significant operation in Lancaster County. The Marcellus black slate was also quarried in Monroe County, Pennsylvania, for school slates used by students in 19th-century rural schools.|$|E

5|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{influential}} factor shaping this new class was the competitive nature of scholarly candidates entering civil service through the imperial examinations. Although not all scholar-officials came from the landholding class, sons of prominent landholders had better access to higher education, and thus greater ability to pass examinations for government service. Gaining a scholarly degree by passing prefectural, circuit-level, or palace exams in the Song period {{was the most important}} prerequisite in being considered for appointment, especially to higher posts; this was a departure from the Tang period, when the examination system was enacted on a much smaller scale. A higher degree attained through the three levels of examinations meant a greater chance of obtaining higher offices in government. Not only did this ensure a higher salary, but also greater social prestige, visibly distinguished by dress. This institutionalized distinction of scholar-officials by dress included the type and even color of traditional silken robes, hats, and girdles, demarcating that scholar-official's level of administrative authority. This rigid code of dress was especially enforced during the beginning of the dynasty, although the prestigious clothing color of purple slowly began to diffuse through the ranks of middle and <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> officials.|$|E
25|$|In rare cases, {{lymphedema}} {{can lead}} to a form of cancer called lymphangiosarcoma, although the mechanism of carcinogenesis is not understood. Lymphedema-associated lymphangiosarcoma is called Stewart-Treves syndrome. Lymphangiosarcoma most frequently occurs in cases of long-standing lymphedema. The incidence of angiosarcoma is estimated to be 0.45% in patients living 5 years after radical mastectomy. Lymphedema is also associated with a <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> form of cancer called retiform hemangioendothelioma (a <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> angiosarcoma).|$|E

25|$|IGCC {{plants are}} {{advantageous}} {{in comparison to}} conventional coal power plants due to their high thermal efficiency, low non-carbon greenhouse gas emissions, and capability to process <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> coal. The disadvantages include higher capital and maintenance costs, {{and the amount of}} CO2 released without pre-combustion capture.|$|E
25|$|Spessartine or {{spessartite}} is manganese aluminium garnet, Mn3Al2(SiO4)3. Its name {{is derived}} from Spessart in Bavaria. It occurs most often in granite pegmatite and allied rock types and in certain <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> metamorphic phyllites. Spessartine of an orange-yellow is found in Madagascar. Violet-red spessartines are found in rhyolites in Colorado and Maine.|$|E
25|$|Heavy mineral sands are placer {{deposits}} formed most {{usually in}} beach environments by concentration {{due to the}} specific gravity of the mineral grains. It is equally likely that some concentrations of heavy minerals (aside from the usual gold placers) exist within streambeds, but most are of a <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> and are relatively small.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, MIM built an SX–EW plant at Mount Isa to recover copper leached from <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> ore stockpiled while mining its Black Rock open {{cut in the}} 1960s. In a world first, a Jameson Cell was used to clean the {{electrolyte}} solution by removing the remaining organic solvent. This replaced the sand filters traditionally used.|$|E
25|$|As of 2010, 24% of {{electricity}} {{produced in the}} U.S. depended on either enriched uranium rods coming from the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (the only domestic site of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> uranium enrichment), or from the 107,336 tons of coal extracted from the state's two coal fields (which combined produce 4% percent of the electricity in the United States).|$|E
25|$|The Curies' {{process was}} still used for {{industrial}} radium extraction in 1940, but mixed bromides were then {{used for the}} fractionation. If the barium content of the uranium ore is not high enough {{it is easy to}} add some to carry the radium. These processes were applied to high grade uranium ores but may not work well with <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> ores.|$|E

25|$|Superheated {{water can}} be used to {{chemically}} convert organic material into fuel products. This is known by several terms, including direct hydrothermal liquefaction, and hydrous pyrolysis. A few commercial scale applications exist. Thermal depolymerization or thermal conversion (TCC) uses superheated water at about 250°C to convert turkey waste into a light fuel oil and is said to process 200 tons of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> waste into fuel oil a day.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} side, the 4.5 inch gun {{was criticized for}} {{insufficient}} power of its high-explosive shell. The shell was produced from <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> ("19 ton") steel, which necessitated thick walls. As a result, it carried only about two kg of TNT or substitute, in fact less than the 105 mm high-explosive shell. Additionally, {{it was felt that}} having a small number of guns of atypical caliber unnecessarily complicated logistics.|$|E

Pure silver will turn the solution bright red, sterling silver will turn it dark red, <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> coin silver (0.800 fine) will turn brown (largely due to the presence of copper which turns the solution brown) and even green for 0.500 silver.|$|E

25|$|The {{first issue}} of the {{magazine}} was published in September 1942. There was an editorial committee of seven under the chairmanship of Masefield; although Masefield wrote most of the early editions himself.

The emphasis of the magazine was to be on training and aircraft recognition techniques along the lines proposed by Masefield.|$|E
25|$|Many {{schools in}} the New England Small College Athletic Conference are known for <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> {{inflation}} and rigorous academic standards. The practice was often contrasted with the Ivy League schools with respect to uncovered grade inflation. Some members have received limited media coverage over perceived grade inflation. The colleges are known {{for a range of}} high and relatively low tuition rates and compressive fees, some of the colleges have been named the most expensive in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The NP's {{desire to}} burn <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> {{semi-bituminous}} coal from company-owned mines at Rosebud, Montana, {{played a part}} {{in the development of the}} 4-8-4 wheel arrangement for steam locomotives. With a BTU fifty percent lower than anthracite coal, the NP's locomotive design called for a much larger firebox, and thus an additional axle on the trailing truck. This led locomotive designers from the 4-8-2 Mountain to the 4-8-4 Northern, first produced by Alco for the NP in 1926 and designated the Class A by the railway.|$|E
