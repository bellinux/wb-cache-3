25|$|Because the Israelites saw no shape when God {{spoke to}} {{them out of the}} fire at Horeb, Moses warned them not to make for {{themselves}} a sculptured image in any likeness whatever — the form of a man, woman, beast, bird, creeping thing, or fish. And when they <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> the sun, moon, stars, and heaven, they were not to be lured into bowing down to them or serving them, for God allotted those things to other peoples, but God took the Israelites and brought them out of Egypt to be God's very own people.|$|E
25|$|Not long afterward, {{during the}} heat of the day, Abraham had been sitting at the {{entrance}} of his tent by the terebinths of Mamre. He <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> three men in the presence of God. Then he ran and bowed to the ground to welcome them. Abraham then offered to wash their feet and fetch them a morsel of bread, to which they assented. Abraham rushed to Sarah's tent to order cakes made from choice flour, then he ordered a servant-boy to prepare a choice calf. When all was prepared, he set curds, milk and the calf before them, waiting on them, under a tree, as they ate.|$|E
25|$|During {{one of the}} National Air Tours, Schneider {{had taken}} off in his Cessna with the Warner Scarab engine, from Chicago bound for the balloon races in Cleveland. He saw the crowd scatter below, <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> the 40-foot left wing of a twenty {{passenger}} Burnelli transport plane directly over him. Passengers in the Burnelli scrambled {{to the other side}} of the cabin to tilt the wing back up. Schneider sent his plane diving just as the Burnelli's wing scraped his plane's wing. A crash was averted by his dip. The officials said his quick action in dipping his plane close to the ground and then pulling clear of the grandstand had probably averted the most serious accident in the races.|$|E

500|$|In September 1833, after {{traveling}} to the French village of Besançon to find cheap paper for a publishing enterprise, Balzac crossed into Switzerland and registered at the Hôtel du Faucon under the name Marquis d'Entragues. He sent word to Hańska that he would visit the garden of the Maison Andrié, {{where she and her}} family were staying. He <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> her face at the window, then– as he described it later– he [...] "lost all bodily sensation". They met later that day (September 25) at a spot overlooking Lake Neuchâtel; according to legend, he noticed a woman reading one of his books. He was overwhelmed with her beauty, and she wrote soon afterwards to her brother, describing Balzac as [...] "cheerful and lovable just like you".|$|E

A number of people in Winton observed the cloud of black smoke in the air {{to the west of the}} town, followed by two columns of dense black smoke rising from ground level.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), as Abraham {{was sitting in}} the {{entrance}} of his tent by the terebinths of Mamre {{in the heat of the}} day, he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> God in the form of three men. [...] He ran, bowed to the ground, and welcomed them. Abraham offered to wash their feet and fetch them a morsel of bread, and they assented. Abraham rushed to Sarah's tent to order cakes made from choice flour, ran to select a choice calf for a servant-boy to prepare, set curds and milk and the calf before them, and waited on them under the tree as they ate. One of the visitors told Abraham that he would return the next year, and Sarah would have a son, but Sarah laughed to herself at the prospect, with Abraham so old. God then questioned Abraham why Sarah had laughed at bearing a child at her age, noting that nothing was too wondrous for God. The first reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
2500|$|The first air–launch was {{performed}} on 25 July 1958 by NOTS research pilot William West, a career US Navy officer. The flight originated from China Lake's airstrip at Inyokern. The jet fighter was placed into a steep climb. The rocket released automatically at 41,000 feet, and three seconds later the first two HOTROCs ignited. The pilot was distracted during this time–the sudden release of weight had flipped his aircraft into a tumble. In mid–crisis, West <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> {{what he thought was}} the vehicle exploding. He reported it that way, but John Nicolaides (director of the Navy's space program in Washington D.C.) later determined that the [...] "explosion" [...] was the plume from the rocket's motors as the exhaust expanded in the thin atmosphere. However, when ground control heard the report of the [...] "explosion", it ordered the ground tracking stations (approximately six in number) around the world to stand down. Thus only one station (at Christchurch NZ) remained on the air; it heard a beeping {{in the right place at}} the right time. However, the signal was not repeated, so the shot was declared a failure.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fifth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), the servant brought out silver, gold, and {{garments}} for Rebekah and presents for {{her brother and}} her mother. Then the servant and his party ate, drank, and spent the night. The next morning, the servant asked leave to return to Abraham, but Laban and her mother asked that Rebekah remain a period of time. The servant persisted, so they called Rebekah to ask for her reply, and she agreed to go. So they blessed Rebekah — wishing that her children be thousands of myriads and seize the gates of their foes — and they sent off Rebekah and her nurse with the servant. Isaac had {{just come back from}} the vicinity of Beer-lahai-roi to his home in the Negeb and was out walking in the field toward evening when he <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> camels approaching. Raising her eyes, Rebekah saw Isaac, alighted from the camel, and asked the servant who the man was. The servant said that Isaac was his master, so she covered herself with her veil. The servant told Isaac everything that had happened, and Isaac brought her into Sarah's tent and took her as his wife. Isaac loved Rebekah, and found comfort after his mother's death. The fifth reading ( [...] , aliyah) and the long first open portion ( [...] , petuchah) end here with the end of chapter ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{their next}} possession, Baltimore went {{from their own}} 20-yard line to New York's 15-yard line in three plays, aided by Matte's 58-yard run. However, with 2 {{minutes left in the}} half, Morrall was intercepted again, by Sample at the Jets' 2-yard line, deflating the Colts considerably. The Jets then were forced to punt on their ensuing drive, and the Colts {{advanced}} the ball to New York's 41-yard line. What followed {{is one of the most}} famous plays in Super Bowl history. Baltimore tried a flea flicker play, which had a huge impact on the momentum of the game. Matte ran off right tackle after taking a handoff, then pitched the ball back to Morrall. The play completely fooled the NBC Camera Crew, and the Jets defense, leaving receiver Jimmy Orr wide open near the end zone. However, Morrall failed to spot him and instead threw a pass intended for running back Jerry Hill that was intercepted by Jets safety Jim Hudson as time expired, maintaining the Jets' 7–0 lead at halftime. Earlier in the season, against the Atlanta Falcons, on the same play, Morrall had completed the same pass for a touchdown to Orr, the play's intended target. [...] "I was the primary receiver," [...] Orr said later. [...] "Earl said he just didn't see me. I was open from here to Tampa." [...] "I'm just a lineman, but I <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> Jimmy open," [...] added center Bill Curry. [...] "I don't know what happened." [...] Some speculated that Morrall couldn't see Orr because the Florida A marching band (in blue uniforms similar to the Colts) was gathering behind the end zone for the halftime show.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the seventh}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), which coincides with chapter [...] {{sometime}} later, God tested Abraham, directing {{him to take}} Isaac {{to the land of}} Moriah and offer him there as a burnt offering. Early the next morning, Abraham saddled his donkey and split wood for the burnt offering, and then he, two of his servants, and Isaac set out for the place that God had named. On the third day, Abraham saw the place from afar, and directed his servants to wait with the donkey, while Isaac and he went up to worship and then return. Abraham took the firestone and the knife, put the wood on Isaac, and the two walked off together. When Isaac asked Abraham where the sheep was for the burnt offering, Abraham replied that God would see to the sheep for the burnt offering. They arrived at the place that God had named, and Abraham built an altar, laid out the wood, bound Isaac, laid him on the altar, and picked up the knife to slay him. Then an angel called to Abraham, telling him not to raise his hand against the boy, for now God knew that Abraham feared God, since he had not withheld his son. Abraham <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> a ram caught in a thicket by its horns, so he offered it as a burnt offering in place of his son. Abraham named the site Adonai-yireh. The angel called to Abraham a second time, saying that because Abraham had not withheld his son, God would bless him and make his descendants as numerous as the stars of heaven and the sands on the seashore, and victorious over their foes. All the nations of the earth would bless themselves by Abraham's descendants, because he obeyed God's command. Abraham returned to his servants, and they departed for Beersheba; where Abraham stayed. The third open portion ( [...] , petuchah) ends here.|$|E
2500|$|Jones' binge {{drinking}} {{and use of}} amphetamines on the road caught up to him in 1967 {{and he had to}} be admitted into a neurological hospital to seek treatment for his drinking. [...] Jones would go to extreme lengths for a drink if the thirst was on him. [...] Perhaps the most famous drinking story concerning Jones occurred while he was married to his second wife Shirley Corley. [...] Jones recalled Shirley making it physically impossible for him to travel to Beaumont, located 8 miles away, to buy liquor. Because Jones would not walk that far, she would hide the keys to each of their cars they owned before leaving. She did not, however, hide the keys to the lawn mower. [...] Upset, Jones walked to the window and looked out over his property. [...] He later described his thoughts in his memoir: [...] "There, gleaming in the glow, was that ten-horsepower rotary engine under a seat. A key glistening in the ignition. I imagine the top speed for that old mower was five miles per hour. It might have taken {{an hour and a half}} or more for me to get to the liquor store, but get there I did." [...] Years later Jones comically mocked the incident by making a cameo in the video for [...] "All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight" [...] by Hank Williams Jr.. He also parodied the episode in the 1993 video for [...] "One More Last Chance" [...] by Vince Gill and in his own music video for the single [...] "Honky Tonk Song" [...] in 1996. Curiously, in her 1979 autobiography Stand By Your Man, Tammy Wynette claims the incident occurred while she was married to Jones, maintaining that she woke up at one o'clock in the morning to find her husband gone: [...] "I got into the car and drove to the nearest bar 10 miles away. When I pulled into the parking lot there sat our rider-mower right by the entrance. He'd driven that mower right down a main highway. [...] He <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> me and said, ‘Well, fellas, here she is now. My little wife, I told you she'd come after me.’" ...|$|E
