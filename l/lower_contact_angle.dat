50|$|In surface science, {{the term}} {{adhesion}} almost always refers to dispersive adhesion. In a typical solid-liquid-gas system (such as {{a drop of}} liquid on a solid surrounded by air) the contact angle is used to evaluate adhesiveness indirectly, while a Centrifugal Adhesion Balance allows for direct quantitative adhesion measurements. Generally, cases where the contact angle is low are considered of higher adhesion per unit area. This approach assumes that the <b>lower</b> <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> corresponds to a higher surface energy. Theoretically, the more exact relation between contact angle and work of adhesion is more involved and is given by the Young-Dupre equation. The contact angle of the three-phase system is a function not only of dispersive adhesion (interaction between the molecules in the liquid and the molecules in the solid) but also cohesion (interaction between the liquid molecules themselves). Strong adhesion and weak cohesion results in {{a high degree of}} wetting, a lyophilic condition with low measured contact angles. Conversely, weak adhesion and strong cohesion results in lyophobic conditions with high measured contact angles and poor wetting.|$|E

Experiments {{were performed to}} determine how the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> and the sliding behavior changed with tilted angle of surface, kind of substrates and temperature. When the molten drop, as a whole, slid down the tilting solid surface, the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> measured were defined as the advancing angle and receding angle, respectively. In general, the contour evolution of sample on Cu substrate experienced three periods and each period had different steps with the increase of the temperature compared to the only two periods on Al 2 O 3, which could explain articulately the spreading and wetting behavior for sample on tilting Cu substrate. The reactive layer near receding contact point was thicker than that near advancing contact point as the molten drop slid, because that the former had longer contact time with substrate than the latter. The sliding behavior on Al 2 O 3 was not the same as that on Cu accompanied which the base profile deformed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

We also show how to introduce the concept of surface disorder within the problem and, inspired by biomimetism, study its effect on superhydrophobicity. Our results, quite generally, prove that introducing disorder, at fixed given roughness, will lower the contact angle: a disordered substrate will have a <b>lower</b> <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> than a corresponding periodic substrate.

30|$|Design and {{deposition}} of different Mn nano-sculptured thin films indicated that structural symmetry, surface roughness and surface void fraction as result of shadowing effect (80 ° deposition angle) may enhance hydrophobicity. Hence, from the obtained results, one may deduce {{that the higher}} contact angle (133 °) obtained for the 4 -pointed helical star nano-sculptured sample {{could be due to}} higher degree of symmetry, higher surface roughness (8.6  nm) and higher void fraction (51.28 %) (Fig.  1; Fig.  2). Structural symmetry with roughness and void fraction of 5 -pointed star sample led to <b>lower</b> <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> (102.6 °) than of 4 -pointed star.

Later, the shape memory behavior of the bulk material is analyzed under different experimental conditions employing a cyclic thermomechanical analysis (TMA). Finally, after creating shape memory micropillars by laser ablation of crosslinked thermo-active polycyclooctene (PCO), shape memory response and associated effect on water contact angle is analyzed.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{surfactants}} to lower surface tension makes them {{a key element}} in many products in a variety of industries. Trisiloxane surfactants have shown extraordinary wetting on hydrophobic surfaces, and are known as "superspreaders". Studies in the past have had inconsistent results characterizing the spreading of these surfactants. In this study, the radius and <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> during spreading of different concentrations of trisiloxane ethoxylate are measured in a humidity-controlled box. Consistent with other studies, concentrations above the critical aggregation concentration spread more, resulting in <b>lower</b> <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> and larger radii. The spreading behavior for radius and <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> can be modeled using an exponential fit. Using the exponential models, a relationship between spreading velocity and <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> can be found.

40|$|Abstract. Silicon {{nitrides}} {{are often}} used as ladles, stalks, heater element protection tubes, etc., in the metal casting industry. A low wettability for molten metals is required for these purposes since wetting by molten metals leads to adhesion of solidified metals, which causes several problems. Surface structure is known to affect wettability. Thus, the present study attempts to fabricate silicon nitrides with controlled surface structures. Silicon nitrides, whose surfaces were covered with ordered hemispherical protrusions, were fabricated by the slip-casting technique. The cast bodies were sintered, and subjected to wettability tests using molten metals. For comparison, silicon nitrides with as-sintered and polished surfaces were also prepared.

The substrates were first cleaned by repeated rinsing with deionized water and ethanol. They were then further cleaned a mixture of NH 3 (25 %, v/v), H 2 O 2 (30 %, v/v), and deionized water having a volume ratio of 1 : 1 : 5 at the temperature of 70 °C during 20 min. Afterward, the substrates were washed with ethanol and dried under nitrogen stream. Finally, these substrates were exposed in UV/ozone chamber (Irvine, CA: Model 42, Jelight Company Inc. USA) for 15 min prior to modification in order to remove hydrocarbon and to produce a hydrophilic surface. For this cleaned surface, the water contact angle was about 3 °. The <b>lower</b> <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> obtained {{is consistent with the}} presence of increased number of hydroxyl groups on the cleaned surface [17].|$|E

As shown in Fig. S 1 a and b, the substrate treated with oxygen plasma has <b>lower</b> <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> values {{than that of the}} non-treated substrate. In addition, Figure S 1 c–g shows that as the copper salt content is increased, the contact angle becomes larger, increasing from 40.8 to 82.7 (0.75 – 1.75  g mL− 1) on the PET substrate. Furthermore, because the contact angle influences the thickness of the coated copper salt film, it significantly determines whether or not the bottom layer of the copper ions can absorb enough energy to be reduced by laser. According to our experimental results, the 1.25  g mL− 1 copper nitrate solution is the optimal condition for coating the film on the substrate. Figure S 2 shows a typical SEM image of copper salt.

40|$|Hydrophobic {{surfaces}} with microscale roughness can {{be rendered}} ultrahydrophobic {{by the addition}} of sub-micron-scale roughness. A simple yet highly effective concept of fabricating hierarchical structured surfaces using a single-step deep reactive ion etch process is proposed. Using this method the complexities generally associated with the fabrication of two-tier roughness structures are eliminated. Three two-tier roughness surfaces with different roughness parameters are fabricated and tested. The surfaces are characterized in terms of the static contact angle and roll-off angle, and are compared with surfaces consisting of only single-tier microscale roughness. The evaporation characteristics of a sessile droplet on the hierarchical surfaces is also assessed relative to comparable single-roughness (SR) surfaces. The robustness of the new hierarchical roughness surfaces is verified through droplet impingement tests. The hierarchical surfaces exhibit very high contact angle and <b>lower</b> <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> hysteresis compared to the SR surfaces and are more resistant to wetting.

The quality of the adhesive bonds was accessed using block shear test in accordance with ASTM D 905. The bond strength depends on how good the adhesive wet the timber surface.

We cultured adipose stem cells on bioabsorbable poly(L-lactide-co-caprolactone) (PLCL) sheets, sterilized using either ethylene oxide (EO), argon glow discharge (aGD) or electron beam (e-beam). Significantly higher values for surface roughness in the order EO > aGD > e-beam and significant differences in <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> (EO > e-beam > aGD) and surface energies (aGD > e-beam > EO) were observed.
