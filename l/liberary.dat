After the Hucknall and Linby Miner's Welfare Band became Newstead Brass, the town no longer had its own band. After the {{decision}} to form the new band, <b>liberaries</b> from the old band and Riddings band were pooled to give the band the boost they needed. Under the careful instruction of conductor Mr Paul Whyley, the band has become an asset to the community, playing concerts at the parish church every Christmas, and around the local area throughout the year. The band also competes, and has enjoyed many successes since forming.|$|R
40|$|Systematic saturating {{the book}} offer by the radically ideological (socrealistic) {{literature}} and {{elimination of the}} traditional popular literature from <b>liberaries</b> and bookshops took place after seizing the entire power by Polish United Workers’ Party (Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza). Publishing and diffusing a hunge number of books unattractive for readers caused an obstruction {{of the system of}} book circulation: individual purchasers and library users ignored publishers’ offer. Flagrant dzsfunctionality of the book circulation extorted from its disposers modification of attitude towards romance, thriller and detective story despised so far and a change of tactics of publishing of the literature on service to socialism. The sign of this change was publication of Polish translation of The Thaw by Ilya Erenburg and a number of home novels attracting readers by thilling or erotic plots. Therefore, a socrealistic popular literature, especially militia-novel that shortly will acquire a great pupularity was arising...|$|R

50|$|Selenographia, sive Lunae descriptio (Selenography, or A Description of The Moon) is a {{milestone}} work by Johannes Hevelius, printed in 1647. In his treatise Hevelius {{reflected on the}} difference between his own work and that of Galileo Galilei.

Selenography... was dedicated to king Wladyslaw IV and along with Riccioli/Grimaldi's Almagestum Novum became the standard work on the Moon for over a century. There are many copies that have survived, including those in Bibliothèque nationale de France, in the library of Polish Academy of Sciences, in the Stillman Drake Collection at the Thomas Fisher Rare Books <b>Liberary</b> at the University of Toronto, and in the Gunnerus Library at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{poses the}} {{question}} about the corporeality of a <b>liberary</b> work. In the first part, the discussion is focused on the issue of a body, based on the phenomenological philosophy of Edmund Husserl and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. The second part presents the concept of liberature or, as it is often called, total literature. The last two sections are centred on the problem of the two types of a <b>liberary</b> “body,” {{as well as on the}} similarities between the phenomenological idea of the body and the corporeality of a <b>liberary</b> text...|$|E
40|$|The article {{discusses}} liberature in {{the context}} of its mathematical qualities. In this trend which inextricably connects the textual and physical layer of the work, each element in the book is expected to be created according to a certain formula which should bring a holistic piece of literature. After 1999, a great number of mathematically-oriented works have appeared which are strictly <b>liberary.</b> In the presentation, I base on the theoretical idea behind liberature when discussing Zenon Fajfer’s <b>liberary</b> work Ten Letters (Pol. Dwadzieścia jeden liter). This innovative piece is analysed mainly {{from the point of view}} of geometry and play with numbers, which is visible already in the title: the ten-letter phrase “ten letters. ” Mathematical qualities are indicated on various layers of the piece: the physical, the textual, and the visual, but especially in its form. The game of numbers is found not only where it is obviously visible and essential to understand the message, but also in places which might not have been intended. Liberature is analysed as literature but at the same time, it is shown not to be literature, and in this respect, to be mathematical at the core...|$|E

40|$|Otto Sverdrup, born 1854, {{is one of}} {{the main}} polar explorers in Norway. However he is much less known not only than Fridtjof Nansen and Roald Amundsen, but also than Hjalmar Johansen, who was a member of Nansen´s Fram {{expedition}} 1893 - 96, and also lesser known than Eivind Astrup, who took part in two of Robert Peary´s expeditons across northern Greenland in 1891 - 92 and 1893 - 94. Hjalmar Johansen and Eivind Astrup published their own accounts from the expeditons: Selv-anden paa 86 ° 14 '. Optegnelser fra Den Norske polarfærd 1893 - 96 (1898) and Blandt Nordpolens naboer (1895). Astrup´s book was reprinted in 1990 and 2004, and Johansen´s book was reprinted in 1942, 1949 and 2003. They are both included in the Polar Library, together with books by Nansen and Amundsen (the Polar <b>Liberary</b> is by Kagge publishing house). Otto Sverdrup´s polar expedition report New Land (Nyt land), a two volume work from 1903, from the second Fram expedition 1898 - 1902 to north-west Greenland and northern Canada, is in comparison never reprinted. He is not in the Polar library. And his name is among readers of travelogues very much forgotten. Why is this, and what kind of book is New Land ?</p...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the article is to locate liberature within a greater {{historical}} and theoretical framework, and to propose an understanding of liberature as a genre. For many years, materiality of literature has been excluded from literary studies, finding its shelter either in library and information studies or among editors. Recently, this tendency has been changing rapidly, as the variety of studies and theories on electronic literacy, new media literacy or the visual aspects of widely recognised works do not cease to prove. Liberature is no exception in this matter. It is argued that the increasing interest in liberature, along with its reception, provides a fertile ground for reading it as an independent genre. With this assumption in mind, {{the very notion of}} genre should no longer be perceived as a fixed collection of bounding rules and categorising devices, but rather as the dialogic and creative space aiming at influencing and referring to other texts. In this sense, such a position of liberature, already recognised in Polish literary criticism, might genuinely serve its predominant purpose to explore the refreshing and effective methods of reading, which apply— but are not limited—to the germinating <b>liberary</b> tradition. In fact, they may stimulate new interpretations of diverse preceding texts, whose both materiality and visuality have been repressed...|$|E
