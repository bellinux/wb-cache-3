25|$|The {{green turtle}} (Chelonia mydas) and the <b>loggerhead</b> <b>turtle</b> (Caretta caretta) both {{live in the}} waters off the Houtman Abrolhos, albeit in low numbers. Neither species breeds in the area, as water {{temperatures}} are too low.|$|E
25|$|An {{increase}} in acidification and warmer water {{leads to a}} decrease in Carbonates which are attributed to coral bleaching as mass bleaching occurs when seas temperatures have exceeded average temperatures by 1 degree for than several weeks. This will impact negatively on the rare back coral trees (Antipathes grandis) found within the Cape Byron Marine Park. Changes in water temperature {{that are associated with}} climate change are also expected to impacted on the life cycle of many species as evidenced by the <b>loggerhead</b> <b>turtle</b> (Caretta caretta) change in nesting patterns and times, this again could lead to an unbalanced ecosystem which could have detrimental effects on other species which rely on the <b>loggerhead</b> <b>turtle</b> for survival.|$|E

50|$|<b>Loggerhead</b> <b>turtles</b> {{are named}} for their large heads that support {{powerful}} jaw muscles, {{allowing them to}} crush hard-shelled prey like clams and sea urchins.

Bycatch, the accidental capture of marine animals in fishing gear, is a serious problem for <b>loggerhead</b> <b>turtles</b> because they frequently come in contact with fisheries.|$|R

25|$|There {{are quite}} regular records of live and {{stranded}} leatherback turtle {{in and around}} the Irish Sea.

They have strayed or been swept out of their natural range further south into colder waters.|$|E
25|$|Sea turtle {{conservation}} groups have publicized concerns that dense V. rotundifolia growth may prevent sea turtles from reaching acceptable nesting sites. These same organizations believe that V. rotundifolia may limit {{the ability of}} baby turtles to reach the ocean after they hatch. A recent USA Today article mentioned these concerns {{as part of an}} effort to raise awareness of V. rotundifolia, and has at least one review article. However, these concerns have not been validated scientifically. Several sea turtle species nest along the coasts of the Carolinas. These include the endangered <b>loggerhead</b> <b>turtle</b> (Caretta caretta), the endangered green turtle (Chelonia mydas), and the critically endangered Kemp's Ridley (Lepidochelys kempii). If scientific evidence is found to support claims that V. rotundifolia harms sea turtles, this threat would constitute a substantial environmental issue.|$|E

50|$|Established in 1932 as a {{haven for}} migratory birds, Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge is {{additionally}} managed {{for the protection of}} threatened and endangered species such as the <b>loggerhead</b> sea <b>turtle,</b> wood stork, and piping plover.

500|$|Fitzinger derived the genus' name, Eretmochelys, {{from the}} Greek roots eretmo and chelys, {{corresponding}} to [...] "oar" [...] and [...] "turtle", respectively. The name {{refers to the}} turtles' oar-like front flippers. The species' name imbricata is Latin, corresponding to the English term [...] This appropriately describes the turtles' overlapping posterior scutes. The Pacific hawksbill's subspecies name, bissa, is Latin for [...] "double". The subspecies was originally described as Caretta bissa; the term referred to the then-species being the second species in the genus. Caretta is the genus of the hawksbill's much larger relative, the <b>loggerhead</b> <b>turtle.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Interactions between large marine {{predators and}} their prey are {{difficult}} to observe and {{little is known about}} the risk of predation faced by sea turtles. The frequency of predator-inflicted injuries, however, has afforded insights into the predation risk faced by many taxa. We measured the frequency of shark-inflicted injuries on green (Chelonia mydas) and loggerhead (Caretta caretta) sea turtles in Shark Bay, Western Australia with a view to determining differences between species and sex-classes in the risk of predation from tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier). Furthermore, we investigated how escape ability and habitat use might influence the probability of turtles being injured by sharks. Shark-inflicted injuries were more frequent on loggerhead than on green turtles, and most frequent on adult male <b>loggerhead</b> <b>turtles.</b> Species effects could not be attributed to differences in habitat use, since green turtles were found in habitats favored by tiger sharks more often than were <b>loggerhead</b> <b>turtles.</b> Green turtles, however, were faster and maneuvered better than <b>loggerhead</b> <b>turtles,</b> suggesting that escape ability is a factor in interspecific differences in injury frequency. The sex-class difference in injury frequency of <b>loggerhead</b> <b>turtles</b> suggests that males face greater predation risk than females and may take more risks. For green turtles, the lack of a sex difference in injury frequency might be due to greater escape ability lowering overall predation risk or to no differences between sexes in the benefits of risk-taking...|$|R
60|$|One day I {{found the}} Gulf Stream a mile off Tennessee Buoy, whereas on other days {{it would be}} close in. On this {{particular}} day the water was a dark, clear, indigo blue and appreciably warmer than the surrounding sea. This Stream has a current of several miles an hour, flowing up the coast. Everywhere we saw the Portuguese men-of-war shining on the waves. There was a slight, cool breeze blowing, rippling the water just enough to make fishing favorable. I saw a big <b>loggerhead</b> <b>turtle,</b> weighing about three hundred pounds, coming around on the surface among these Portuguese men-of-war, and as we ran up I {{saw that he was}} feeding on these queer balloon-like little creatures. Sometimes he would come up under one and it would stick on his back, and he would turn laboriously around from under it, and submerge his back so he had it floating again. Then he would open his cavernous mouth and take it in. Considering the stinging poison these Portuguese men-of-war secrete about them, the turtle must have had a very tabasco-sauce meal. Right away I began to see evidence of fish on the surface, which is always a good sign. We went past a school of bonita breaking the water up into little swirls. Then I saw a smashing break of a sailfish coming out sideways, sending the water in white sheets. We slowed down the boat and got our baits overboard at once. I was using a ballyhoo bait hooked by a small hook through the lips, with a second and larger hook buried in the body. R. C. was using a strip of mullet, which for obvious reasons seems to be the preferred bait from Palm Beach to Long Key. And the obvious reason is that nobody seems to take the trouble to get what might be proper bait for sailfish. Mullet is an easy bait to get and commands just as high a price as anything else, which, as a matter of fact, is highway robbery. With a bait like a ballyhoo or a shiner I could get ten bites to one with mullet.|$|E
