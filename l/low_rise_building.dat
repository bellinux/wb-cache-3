[...] 60 {{percent of the land}} area was left green. At the time a Sprint official said Sprint opted for a <b>low</b> <b>rise</b> <b>building</b> rather than a tall structure because [...] "communication doesn't happen as well when offices are vertical instead of horizontal."

Abstract:In order {{to research the}} seismic property of masonry building constructed with the construction waste recycled bricks, a four stories building model with 1 : 3 scale is constructed and tested on the shaking table. Based on the test results, the cracks pattern, displacement response, acceleration response of the building are studied. The failure mechanism of the infill building is investigated. The {{results show that the}} construction waste recycled brick is a qualified building material to construct the <b>low</b> <b>rise</b> <b>building.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Wind induced {{damage on}} {{low-rise}} buildings with complex roof geometry {{is common in}} coastal areas of USA, such as Florida and Louisiana. Available design codes provide information about the design of regular roof geometries (e. g. hip/gable roofs), but refer to wind tunnel modelling for complex roof geometries. Due to time and financial constraints physical modelling {{may not always be}} possible to carry out. Computational modelling through Large Eddy Simulation (LES) has been used successfully for several wind engineering applications. This paper presents comparisons between LES and previously obtained wind tunnel data of mean and peak pressure coefficients on a <b>low</b> <b>rise</b> <b>building</b> with complex roof geometry. Two different cases, namely: isolated building and the effect of neighbouring buildings have been considered for the most critical wind direction of 135 degrees. Results show that the mean pressure coefficients on the <b>low</b> <b>rise</b> <b>building</b> roof for the case with adjacent buildings were somewhat lower in magnitude (less suction) than the isolated case. In general, excellent matching was obtained within a factor of 1. 1 between wind tunnel and LES for all roof locations except at the roof ridge, where the latter predicted somewhat lower mean and peak pressure coefficient values than wind tunnel data. The velocity streamlines obtained from LES provide an excellent overview of the airflow around the buildings. This study shows the efficacy of LES for assessing wind loads on building roofs with complex geometry, since existing codes do not provide any quantitative assessment methods for such problems...|$|E

This summarizes the study that is carried out to evaluate the possible causes of distress in the G+ 1 residential building founded on shallow foundation in Chennai, Tamilnadu, India by Detailed Investigation. Disturbed and Undisturbed samples are collected by drilling borehole up to significant depth by auger. Laboratory tests are carried out on disturbed and undisturbed soil samples obtained from the site of distressed building. The cause of failure of the structure are identified by considering the soil properties, intensity of loading, nature of foundation and pattern of cracks developed. Based on the degree of distress, the suitable measures are recommended...|$|E

40|$|Severe {{tropical}} cyclones can subject <b>low</b> <b>rise</b> <b>building</b> roofs {{to large}} fluctuating pressures. These fluctuating wind loads can cause failure of building elements susceptible to low cycle fatigue. Following the devastation caused by Cyclone Tracy to Darwin, cyclic loading test criteria, such as TR 440 and DABM, {{were developed to}} enable cladding {{to be tested for}} their potential to fail due to low cycle. The previous test criteria have been replaced by the recent introduction of the cyclic Low High Low (L-H-L) test, based on the “design” cyclone derived by Jancauskas et al [1]. The research was conducted using line load sinusoidal loading systems. With the development of real time simulated wind loading actuators (PLA) the performance of a cladding specimen is examined during a simulated “design” cyclone...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a general}} belief that Sri Lanka is in a {{disaster}} free zone. However, frequent cyclone warnings and earthquake tremors {{over the past few}} decades and the December 2004 Tsunami show that this belief may no longer be valid for Sri Lanka. The Tsunami of 26 th December 2004, which devastated a 800 km stretch of costal area of Sri Lanka killed more than 36, 000 unwary people and displaced more than 800, 000. It was the worst ever disaster in the history of Sri Lanka. Due to inadequate attention paid to these events in construction practice, the damages caused are enormous both to human life and to the built environment. There is no guarantee that this kind of natural disaster will not happen again. They could repeat in the future, may be with lower magnitudes or intensity. This indicates that some kind of disaster preparedness is of great importance today. This paper deals with few natural disasters which could affect the built environment, and suggests some simple and useful guidelines to improve the disaster resistance of <b>low</b> <b>rise</b> <b>building...</b>|$|E

There is a possibility of a wind environment induced discomfort even with a <b>low</b> <b>rise</b> <b>building</b> in this area.

The purpose of this study is to develope the new criteria for Niigata City by the wind tunnel experiment, the field survey and the questionnaire. The results are as follows, (1) By the questionnaire survey of the wind strength, the conscious of the wind strength will be begun when to put up an umbrella is difficulty, and discomfort break out when a walk is a difficulty. (2) The criteria of the wind environment in Niigata area is laxer than the acceptable frequency of Murakami's criteria. As for this criteria, the acceptable days per annum that is the maximum gust wind speed exceeds lOm/s per a day of the 1. 5 m height is 102 days, and 15 m/s is 21 days, over 20 m/s is 4 days...|$|E
