James's sporting abilities such as wrestling, hammer throwing, archery and jousting are also listed by Bower. He described James as possessing an 'eagerness' in 'literary composition and writing', {{the best known of}} which is his love poem, The Kingis Quair.

Few or none of his directives hold forth along most places down the Ganges today. Journalist Joshua Hammer wrote a very illustrative account of his personal visit to the Ganges in which he described seeing both animal and human corpses floating down the river or sometimes embedded in heaps of garbage. People continued to bathe, and children to play in very murky waters; the color in some parts completely changed from toxic sewage and runoff (Hammer 2007). As the Ganges River remains interwoven into daily existence, Hindus are vulnerable to urban contamination. Irony lies in that this river is venerated for her ability to wash away contaminants, yet is being stagnated.|$|R

In the Universal Declaration of Human Rights human rights are qualities of human beings independently of their race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. In the Universal Islamic Declaration of Human Rights “Human rights […] are firmly rooted in the belief that God, and God alone, is the <b>Law</b> <b>Giver</b> and the Source of all human rights”.

The shape in which a statute is imposed on the community as a guide for conduct is that statute as interpreted by the courts. The courts put life into the dead words of the statute. 339 To quote from Bishop Hoadly.......Nay, whoever hath an absolute authority to interpret any written or spoken laws, it is He who is truly the <b>law</b> <b>Giver</b> to all intents and purposes, and not who first who wrote and spoke them”.|$|R
40|$|During Second World War, Lord Atkin famously contradicted Cicero’s 2000 -year-old dictum (Silent enim leges inter arma), 1 when he said: “In this country, {{amid the}} clash of arms the laws are not silent. They may be changed, but they speak the same {{language}} in war as in peace. ” 2 In contemporary states, it is rare to rule by brutal force, even in times of emergencies, threats to national security, or even in times of occupation of an alien population. Israel indeed ruled West Bank and Gaza Strip using law and legality. Changes to local Palestinian legal and judicial systems were often introduced through military orders. In this paper I discuss the nature and role of rules by legislated statutes, enacted by the Palestinian Authority since its establishment in 1994, and the rules by military orders, enacted by Israel since its occupation of the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and Gaza Strip since 1967. I investigate on the difference between both enactments, their place within the legal system of the occupied Palestinian territory, and their contribution into framing and limiting state’s exercise of power over the population under its jurisdiction. Indirectly, but inevitably, this paper will give an insight on the difference that exists between the law produced by a national <b>law</b> <b>giver</b> and the <b>law</b> produced by an alien <b>law</b> <b>giver.</b> To make my case simpler, I imagine a Palestinian judge, 3 in the court of Ramallah in 1968, one year after the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, who needed to rule whether to accept the claim of the plaintiff, based on a military order, or the respondent opposite claim, based on a rule present in a Jordanian law. If he admits that rules contained in military order are rules of law, then the second question would be whether he is under the moral obligation to apply the military order. 4 I then imagine the same judge in 1997, three years after the establishment of the Palestinian Authority, having to rule a similar case without any legislation, yet, from the Palestinian Authority. What to do? 5 The list of cases in which the legality of legislated enactments may be under question may continue...|$|R

40|$|The {{coming into}} effect as {{of the end of}} 2004 of new {{regulations}} in the field of administrative contentious represented the introduction of a new approach over such institution (a genuine modification of the "text philosophy", as expressed by the law's initiator); however, in the same time this moment also generated some - we might say - virulent criticism. The said criticism mainly referred to the somehow "revolutionary" solution used by the organic <b>law</b> <b>giver,</b> namely of introducing in the legal regulations an article comprising juridical definitions of various terms used throughout the law. In the present study, we shall attempt to shape one of the law's key terms, which is the subjective right term; a future research is to further detail a term closely connected to such, which is the notion of legal interest. Aware of the difficulty of our pursuit herein, given the vivid debates arising in time in most law areas between the two terms (hence exceeding the limits of administrative law), we shall limit our attempt to describing the juridical views regarding such, without claiming to draw out a definition exceeding any criticism. To the possible extent, we shall seek for answers to various questions arising herein...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} theory of istihsan, an aspect of Islamic legal reasoning, as a method for ascertaining the legal norm in cases where qiyas {{dictates}} an overly strict ruling. The study primarily focuses on the concept presented by Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728 / 1328), a prominent Muslim theologian, philosopher, sufi and outstanding jurist. Placed {{in the context of}} later development, Ibn Taymiyya's theory proposes both a criticism and reformulation of the Hanafi school's perception of istihsan. Having observed previous formulations, Ibn Taymiyya sees this theory as being understood as an arbitrary contradiction to qiyas. Although attempts to redefine the theory, through rigorous definition and well-calculated application were conducted by later Hanafi jurists, criticism from other schoools continued unabated. To this effect, Ibn Taymiyya's contribution emerges as an alternative solution. In order to fully understand istihsan, Ibn Taymiyya contends that one must determine particularization of the cause (takhsid s al-'illa). By doing this, istihsan and qiyas can be easily distinguished. He, thus, perceives istihsan as takhsid s al-'illa. Unlike the Hanafis, Ibn Taymiyya does not juxtapose istihsan against qiyas sahid h. He argues {{that if there is a}} contradiction, it must be proved by a decisive descrepancy (farq mu'aththir) provided by the <b>law</b> <b>giver.</b> Furthermore, when qiyas produces an unsatisfactory legal norm, takhsid s al-'illa represents a viable alternative. Above all, Ibn Taymiyya contends that istihsan must be supported by the revealed texts, consensus or necessity...|$|R
5000|$|Open theism also {{answers the}} {{question}} of how God can be blameless and omnipotent even though evil exists in the world. H. Roy Elseth gives an example of a parent that knows with certainty that his child would go out and murder someone if he was given a gun. Elseth argues that if the parent did give the gun to the child then the parent would be responsible for that crime. However, if God was unsure about the outcome then God would not be culpable for that act; only the one who committed the act would be guilty. This position is, however, dubious, as a parent who knows his child was probable, or likely, or even possibly going to shoot someone would be culpable; and God knew that it was likely that man would sin, and thus God is still culpable. An orthodox Christian might try, on the contrary, seek to ground a Theodicy in the Resurrection, both of Christ and the general Resurrection to come, though this is not the traditional answer to evil. Another position put forth by Orthodox Christians is to point out that God is the ultimate <b>law</b> <b>giver</b> and thus there exists no objective standard of good or evil above God regulating God. Therefore, the so-called problem of evil, which presupposes such an independent standard, is not an objection that a Bible believing Christian has to respond to.

40|$|The {{varieties}} of marriage described by Manu and accepted by Vatsyayana are mentioned. The {{qualities of the}} bride and bridegroom for an ideal marriage are enumerated by Vatsyayana. The Shastraic view of the same along with the valid conditions of a Hindu Marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 are contrasted. The role of the virtuous wife in house-keeping and looking after the husband, according to Vatsyayana, is highlighted. A brief mention is made of adultery and prostitution in various times in India. It is concluded that Vatsyayana's view on marital harmony could be utilised even to-day by various therapists. In an earlier paper, the author (Somassundaram, 1986) gave particulars about the great Indian work on sexuality by the Sage Vatsyayana and dealt with the sexual aspects of marriages; he has also written about the medico-legal aspects of marriage and divorce coming under {{the purview of the}} Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (Somasundaram, 1970). This act had been amended in 1976 and a few important changes have been incorporated into it. It should be remembered that the Kama Sutra is not merely a handbook intended for the guidance of the newly weds but also deals with the various aspects of marital life and problems likely to arise in the course of one. It must also be borne in mind that the Hindu <b>law</b> <b>giver,</b> Manu and some of his more famous commentators like Yagnavalkya have preceded Vatsyayana who has deviated from them in some ways.
