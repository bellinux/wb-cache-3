5000|$|Old Hickory Reservoir is [...] long lying between Nashville and Carthage. The {{reservoir}} {{is essentially}} a run-of-river type without regulating storage other than for incidental flood control through surcharge operation, and for pondage for power generation and lockages; hence, <b>low</b> <b>water</b> flow <b>of</b> the <b>river</b> will be increased only indirectly through the use and passage of discharges from upstream plants. Such releases, however, result in a more sufficient and higher quality <b>of</b> <b>water</b> for domestic and industrial consumption and use are effective in pollution abatement downstream. Due to the fairly constant level maintained under normal operating conditions, the reservoir is well suited for conservation and recreational purposes. Beginning in 2007, the multi-year altered flow and water temperatures resulting from the emergency maintenance on the Wolf Creek Dam affected Old Hickory like the other Cumberland River reservoirs and resulted in modifications about environmental management.|$|R
40|$|Analysis using {{historical}} {{data on the}} phosphate sources in Changjiang (Yangtze River) estuary show that phosphate was supplied equally from the east, south, west and north of the estuary. These sources include the Changjiang River, the Taiwan Warm Current (TWC), a cyclone-type eddy, and the 32 A degrees N Upwelling, supplying different phosphates in different times, ways and intensities. The magnitude of their supplying phosphate concentration was related with the size in the order <b>of</b> the Changjiang <b>River</b> the TWC > the cyclone-type eddy > the 32 A degrees N Upwelling. The four sources supplied {{a great deal of}} phosphate so that the phosphate concentration in the estuary was kept above 0. 2 mu mol/L in previous years, satisfying the phytoplankton growth. The horizontal and vertical distribution of the phosphate concentration showed that near shallow marine areas at 122 A degrees E/ 31 A degrees N, the TWC in low nutrient concentration became an upwelling through sea bottom and brought up nutrients from sea bottom to marine surface. In addition, horizontal distribution of phosphate concentration was consistent with that of algae: Rhizosolenia robusta, Rhizosolenia calcaravis and Skeletonema, which showed that no matter during high <b>water</b> or <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>of</b> Changjiang <b>River,</b> these species brought by the TWC became predominant species. Therefore, the authors believe that the TWC flowed from south to north along the coast and played a role in deflecting the Changjiang River flow from the southern side...|$|R
25|$|After his {{situation}} had become hopeless at Camden, Steele gave up all thoughts of uniting with Banks on the Red River in a further campaign to take Shreveport {{and realized that}} he had to save his army. The battle of Jenkins' Ferry showed that Steele's force indeed was in danger while it was at Camden and southwest <b>of</b> the Saline <b>River.</b> Steele's decision to retreat to Little Rock therefore was a good one. Banks in turn had to give up any hope of renewing his campaign against Shreveport. His major problems in renewing the campaign actually did not include an insufficient number of men, however, because he was reinforced in late April by forces under Major-General John McClernand. Banks had logistical problems and would not have gunboat transport and support because of Porter’s inability to operate in the unusually <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>of</b> the Red <b>River</b> during that spring and summer. In fact, Banks had to protect Porter’s fleet at Alexandria, Louisiana until it could be freed from the Red River on May 13 before he could move in any direction.|$|R
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1890, having become {{somewhat}} weary under the increasing burdens of his position, he resigned his office as President of the Board of Public Improvements to accept membership in the Mississippi River Commission in the place made vacant by the resignation of Captain Eads. In this latter position he remained until his death, giving to the work his best energies and nearly the whole of his time. The new policy <b>of</b> deepening the <b>low</b> <b>water</b> channel <b>of</b> the <b>river</b> by dredging rather than by contraction works, which the commission adopted during his membership, was very largely {{the result of his}} efforts.

40|$|Until 1982, our Knowledge ofthe boats {{used on the}} Saône {{before the}} 19 th century {{was limited to the}} chance {{discovery}} ofseveral small logboats. Seven of them were found {{at the end of the}} last century, in the Upper Saône as well as at Chalon and Tournas. Three of thèse only, the Saint-Albin, Apremont and Rigny dugouts, were able to be saved by the muséums of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Besançon. These discoveries alone, which have been incorrectly dated and little studied or not at ail, could hardly answer the current questions of researchers. It is obvious that during the last decades, the dredging carried out in the <b>lowest</b> <b>water</b> level <b>of</b> the <b>river</b> with more and more powerful means, has led to the destruction oftens or even hundreds of boats from ail periods, mainly around the fordable shallow areas. With rare exceptions, thèse discovenes hâve gone unnoticed for the simple reason that they were quite banal for the dredger workers. Since 1982, within the framework ofthe activities of the « Archeology » section ofthe Museum of Chalon, regular excavation campaigns and underwater prospecting on the Saône bed hâve led to the discovery ofsix new wrecks ranging from the end ofthe Bronze Age to the 19 th century. Only three of them have, today, been part of an excavation or salvage programme. Even if all thase small crafts have not been studied exhaustively, the research has, nevertheless, provided a coherent vision of the evolution of boats on the Saône over the last three thousand years.

40|$|BEFORE his {{departure}} from Thailand in early 1970, the then British Consul inChiang Mai, D. C. M. Rivette-Carnac, O. B.

Among them was a fragment of a natural, flat water-rolled pebble, which obviously had broken while it. {{was in the process}} of having a biconical central hole drilled from both of the flat sides. Later I had an opportunity to survey the find spot, which is in Ban Nong Chalab approximately 15 km north of Muang Tak, Changwat Tak, quite near the left bank of Mae Nam Ping and between this and the old highway linking Muang Tak with Amphoe Thoen. The whole area is rather disturbed due to its seasonal use as a storage place for teak logs, and the only find during the survey was a small Hoabinhian-like pebble tool. In the course of the same survey another two sites of Hoabinhian affinity were discovered at km 5 and Ian 13 from Muang Tak near the new highway to Thoen. All three sites are located at the lowest river terrace, which is here 6 to 8 m above the <b>low</b> <b>water</b> level <b>of</b> the <b>river.</b> During the general survey of North Thailand undertaken as part of the prehistoric project of the Scandinavian Institute of Asian Studies Field Research Station at Lampang, another 17 fragments of perforated stones were discovered at six different sites. An additional complete specimen was shown to me by Khun Kraisri Nimman-haeminda of Chiang Mai. It was found between Chiang Mai and Fang. Still another fragment, said to be from a cave in the Doi Sakhet area of Chiang Mai, was seen in the National Museum in Chiang Mai. However, neither of the latter stones are dealt with here.
