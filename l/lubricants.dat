40|$|Abstract: This paper {{explains}} {{the effect of}} various <b>lubricant</b> and engine temperatures on the intake mass air flow, engine noise and <b>lubricant</b> pressure behaviour of a motor-driven spark ignition engine. The <b>lubricant</b> pressure, engine noise and mass air flow changes were recorded under a steady state operating condition with an increased engine speed in which both the volume and temperature of the <b>lubricant</b> remained unchanged for each sets of test. The engine was driven by an electric motor at a wide-open throttle and a constant speed ranging from 500 to 3000 rpm with 500 rpm increment. The <b>lubricant</b> and cooling water were set at 32 °C (unheated) and 90 °C (heated) for each run. In general, {{the pressure of the}} <b>lubricant</b> was found to decrease for either increased engine speed or <b>lubricant</b> temperature. It was found that high <b>lubricant</b> viscosity produced high overall engine friction and resulted to a higher engine noise. Heated <b>lubricant</b> started off with a very low pressure with 0. 996 bar compared to unheated <b>lubricant</b> with 2. 497 bar in 500 rpm. Unheated engine <b>lubricant</b> recorded a peak noise of 107. 2 dB at 1500 rpm before it dropped momentarily before increased linearly beyond this speed.

However, it was found from past researches that, at the predefined mileage or timeframe, most <b>lubricant</b> is still acceptably usable and efficient. Approach: This research aimed to calculate useful life of <b>lubricant</b> {{in order to reach}} its maximum usefulness. The method of study began by collecting data that indicates deterioration of <b>lubricant</b> by increasing mileage which includes total base number, viscosity, iron and flash point. Then the data was analyzed by means of Analysis Hierarchy Process (AHP).

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{stability}} and longevity of surface-stabilized <b>lubricant</b> layers {{is a critical}} question in their application as low-and nonfouling slippery surface treatments in both industry and medicine. Here, we investigate <b>lubricant</b> loss from surfaces under flow in water using both quantitative analysis and visualization, testing the effects of underlying surface type (nanostructured versus flat), as well as flow rate in the physiologically relevant range, <b>lubricant</b> type, and time. We find <b>lubricant</b> losses {{on the order of}} only ng/cm 2 in a closed system, indicating that these interfaces are relatively stable under the flow conditions tested. No notable differences emerged between surface type, flow rate, <b>lubricant</b> type, or time. However, exposure of the <b>lubricant</b> layers to an air/water interface did significantly increase the amount of <b>lubricant</b> removed from the surface, leading to disruption of the layer. These results may help in the development and design of materials using surface-immobilized <b>lubricant</b> interfaces for repellency under flow conditions. 1...|$|R
