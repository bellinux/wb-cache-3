5|$|Jeter {{committed}} 18 {{errors in}} 2007, his highest total since finishing with 24 in 2000. After the season, Cashman {{and his staff}} saw Jeter's defense as an area {{that needed to be}} addressed. At the Yankees' request, Jeter embarked on a rigorous training program to combat the effects of age, by focusing on <b>lateral</b> <b>movement</b> and first-step quickness. Jeter's ultimate zone rating (UZR) improved from worst in the AL for shortstops in 2007 to close to league average in 2008.|$|E
5|$|A {{distinct}} defining {{feature of}} a Surtseyan eruption is {{the formation of}} a pyroclastic surge (or base surge), a ground hugging radial cloud that develops along with the eruption column. Base surges are caused by the gravitational collapse of a vaporous eruptive column, one that is denser overall then a regular volcanic column. The densest part of the cloud is nearest to the vent, resulting a wedge shape. Associated with these laterally moving rings are dune-shaped depositions of rock left behind by the <b>lateral</b> <b>movement.</b> These are occasionally disrupted by bomb sags, rock that was flung out by the explosive eruption and followed a ballistic path to the ground. Accumulations of wet, spherical ash known as accretionary lapilli is another common surge indicator.|$|E
5|$|Basin and Range-associated {{stretching}} {{of large}} parts of crust below southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico started around 16millionyears ago and the region is still spreading. This stretching began to affect the Death and Panamint valleys area by 3million years ago. Before this, rocks now in the Panamint Range were on top of rocks that would become the Black Mountains and the Cottonwood Mountains. Lateral and vertical transport of these blocks was accomplished by movement on normal faults. Right-lateral movement along strike-slip faults that run parallel to and {{at the base of}} the ranges also helped to develop the area. Torsional forces, probably associated with northwesterly movement of the Pacific Plate along the San Andreas Fault (west of the region), is responsible for the <b>lateral</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E
40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} hand preference and conjugate <b>lateral</b> eye <b>movements.</b> The sample comprised of 224 persons. The hand preference was assessed using a handedness inventory. Conjugate <b>lateral</b> eye <b>movements</b> were elicited in response to verbal and spatial questions among left-, mixed- and right-handers. The left- and mixed-handers exhibit significantly greater number of conjugate <b>lateral</b> eye <b>movements</b> than the right-handers. On the verbal task, right-handers exhibit rightward conjugate <b>lateral</b> eye <b>movements,</b> and left- and mixed-handers exhibit leftward conjugate <b>lateral</b> eye <b>movements.</b> On the spatial questions, right-handers exhibit leftward conjugate <b>lateral</b> eye <b>movements</b> and left- and mixed-handers also exhibit leftward conjugate <b>lateral</b> eye <b>movements.</b> While right-handers show normal lateralization pattern, the left- and mixed-handers show right brain dominance irrespective {{of the nature of}} questions...|$|R

5|$|Each {{battery-powered}} vehicle, or AGV, {{is made up}} of two platforms. Riders sit on {{the upper}} platform, which provides three degrees of freedom. A lower platform provides omnidirectional <b>lateral</b> <b>movement.</b> Unlike previous ride designs, the trackless system and the wheel and motor configurations allow movements diagonal to a rider's perspective. The vehicles use a dead reckoning system developed by Frog AGV to navigate their way through the environment, allowing a vehicle to cross another's path. Each vehicle features a built-in controller, which wirelessly communicates with a central ride-system controller. Movement commands are issued by the ride-system controller, and executed by the vehicles' controllers. A specially-designed battery and charge system allow the vehicles to be quickly charged while docked at the loading and unloading platforms.|$|E
5|$|Light {{wind shear}} and {{favorable}} ocean temperatures led to steady intensification of the storm, and satellite images indicated that an eye had developed late on August 31. Minimum pressure lowered to , and the maximum winds increased to 100mph, Category2 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm quickly reached Category3, a major hurricane, and soon after, Category4. As it did so, its eye became ragged, while its <b>lateral</b> <b>movement</b> {{to the northwest}} rose to 17mph around the southern periphery of a strong deep-layer ridge over the United States. By September 1, the hurricane reached its peak intensity of 160mph (260km/h) and a minimum pressure of 921mb (hPa). It had reached Category5, the second of three such powerful storms that would do so during the season.|$|E
5|$|The farther forward (closer {{to front}} wheel) {{the center of}} mass of the {{combined}} bike and rider, the less the front wheel has to move laterally {{in order to maintain}} balance. Conversely, the farther back (closer to the rear wheel) the center of mass is located, the more front wheel <b>lateral</b> <b>movement</b> or bike forward motion is required to regain balance. This can be noticeable on long-wheelbase recumbents, choppers, and wheelie bikes. It can also be a challenge for touring bikes that carry a heavy load of gear over or even behind the rear wheel. Mass over the rear wheel can be more easily controlled if it is lower than mass over the front wheel.|$|E

50|$|The {{universal}} {{expansion joint}} can absorb not only axial movements but angular and <b>lateral</b> <b>movements</b> as well. It {{consists of two}} metal bellows with an intermediate pipe and connectors on both sides. As a special form of the axial expansion joint, the universal expansion joint has only a limited pressure resistance for stability reasons and, moreover, loads the adjacent pipe supports with the axial compressive force resulting from the internal pressure. It is usually used to compensate large axial and <b>lateral</b> <b>movements</b> at low pressure.|$|R
5|$|The plasma {{membrane}} is a phospholipid bilayer membrane {{that separates the}} cell from its environment and regulates the transport of molecules and signals {{into and out of}} the cell. Embedded in the membrane are proteins that perform the functions of the {{plasma membrane}}. The plasma membrane is not a fixed or rigid structure, the molecules that compose the membrane are capable of <b>lateral</b> <b>movement.</b> This movement and the multiple components of the membrane are why it is referred to as a fluid mosaic. Smaller molecules such as carbon dioxide, water, and oxygen can pass through the plasma membrane freely by diffusion or osmosis. Larger molecules needed by the cell are assisted by proteins through active transport.|$|E
5|$|Whereas many {{pitchers}} throw with a three-quarter or sidearm motion, Koufax threw with {{a pronounced}} over-the-top arm action. This may have increased his velocity, but reduced the <b>lateral</b> <b>movement</b> on his pitches, especially {{movement away from}} left-handed hitters. Most of his velocity came from his strong legs and back, combined with a high kicking wind-up and long forward stretch toward the plate. Throughout his career, Koufax relied mostly on two pitches. His four-seam fastball gave batters the impression of rising as it approached them, due to underspin. It not only appeared to move very late but also might move two or three distinct times. His overhand curveball, spun with the middle finger, dropped vertically 12 to 24inches due to his arm action. Rob Neyer called it the best curve of all time. He also occasionally threw a changeup and a forkball.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} {{two weeks}} {{on the disabled list}} with a groin strain during the opening month of the 1998 season, Rivera continued to establish himself as one of the major leagues' best closers. Moreover, he became the central figure of a Yankees bullpen that, supported by middle relievers Jeff Nelson and Mike Stanton, contributed to the team's late-1990s dynasty. That year, Rivera made the cutter one of his primary pitches, and it quickly became his signature, earning a reputation for breaking hitters' bats with its sharp <b>lateral</b> <b>movement.</b> He saved 36games in 41opportunities and had a 1.91ERA in the regular season. In the 1998 postseason, he pitched scoreless innings and saved six games, three of which came in the 1998 World Series against the San Diego Padres. Rivera's save in Game 4 of the series clinched the Yankees' championship, capping off a season in which they won an MLB-record 125games combined in the regular season and the postseason. By season's end, Rivera had allowed only two earned runs in 35 career postseason innings pitched—a 0.51ERA—and by passing 30innings pitched, he qualified for the major league record for lowest postseason career ERA; it is a record he still holds after 141innings pitched.|$|E
50|$|The spiral plater rotates {{the dish}} while {{simultaneously}} dispensing the liquid and either linearly moving the dish or the dispensing tip. This creates the common spiral pattern. If all movements {{are done in}} constant speed, the spiral created would have a lower concentration {{on the outside of}} the plate than on the inside. More advanced spiral platers provide different options for spiral patterns such as constant concentration (by slowing down the spinning and / or the <b>lateral</b> <b>movements)</b> or exponential concentration (by speeding up the spinning and / or the <b>lateral</b> <b>movements).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Again, view camera users usually {{distinguish}} between vertical movements (rise and fall) and <b>lateral</b> <b>movements</b> (shift or cross), while small- and medium-format users often refer to {{both types of}} movements as [...] "shift".|$|R

5|$|Margarito, {{traditionally}} {{a sluggish}} starter, anticipated to emerge swift, {{but it was}} Cotto who {{got off to a}} more effective start by throwing numerous punches and applying plenty of movement. Cotto picked up where he left off in the second round, approaching directly at Margarito though easily getting by harm's way once Margarito sought to counterpunch. That, nevertheless, changed approximately a minute into the round, as Margarito landed a right hand that momentarily had Cotto by the ropes. Margarito directed his assault to Cotto's body, but Cotto landed various left hooks. Blood started descending from Cotto's nose, but did not discourage him from closing the round by landing a punch upon Margarito. Mobility represented the key for Cotto in the third round, efficaciously blending boxing and brawling while trying to minimize the blood flow from his nose and a small cut over his left eye. Margarito continued targeting the body, but drew two distinguish warnings for low blows in the span of less than a minute. Margarito closed the gap sufficiency in the fourth round by landing a right uppercut and attacking Cotto's body to slow him down. In the fifth round, Cotto provided plenty of <b>lateral</b> <b>movement</b> which frustrated Margarito. Cotto persisted on the move and would land a flurry of punches prior to directly escaping harm's way. Margarito landed a straight right hand that had Cotto temporarily unsteady with ten seconds to go, but Cotto eluded all of the ensuing punches until the final bell.|$|E
5|$|While Margarito did not land {{a lot of}} punches, he {{remained}} the more engaged fighter in the sixth round. A left hook to the body had Cotto on the defensive early in the seventh round, but {{he was able to}} fend off additional difficulty. A right hand from Cotto slowed Margarito, but he returned with punches that forced Cotto to clinch. Margarito commanded the bulk of the round, throwing 130punches in the round according to Compubox. Cotto was advocated by his corner in between rounds to stay off the ropes. He obliged, providing <b>lateral</b> <b>movement</b> throughout the round but with approximately 30seconds left, Margarito was able to trap Cotto in a corner, but Cotto managed to escape. It was more of the same in the ninth round, with Cotto going back and forth between southpaw and conventional stance. Margarito continued charging ahead, although Cotto would counterpunch sufficiency to avoid Margarito. The same pattern applied as in the previous two rounds, with Margarito charging forward and Cotto using movement while anticipating chances to counterpunch. Margarito immediately concluded the gap in the final 15seconds, landing a left hook, left uppercut and right hand that had Cotto against the ropes. Halfway through the eleventh round, a left uppercut by Margarito left Cotto vulnerable as he took a knee after Margarito landed a right uppercut and two right hands. Cotto managed to get up, but he went down again, despite Margarito not landing another punch. The referee moved in to count, but Evangelista Cotto, Cotto's trainer and uncle, climbed onto the ring apron and threw in the towel. The official time of the stoppage was 2:05of round eleven.|$|E

50|$|Movement outside roads {{was thus}} {{impossible}} for large military formations. Only one road existed from the Soviet border to Salla.

50|$|Shear {{structures}}: These are {{structures such as}} {{reinforced concrete}} or wooden shear walls, which are used in multistory buildings to reduce <b>lateral</b> <b>movements</b> due to wind loads and earthquake excitations.

50|$|A jump {{consists}} of a sprint to the pole (polsstok), jumping and grabbing it, then climbing {{to the top of}} the pole while trying to control its forward and <b>lateral</b> <b>movements</b> over a body of water, and finishing by landing on a sand bed opposite to the starting point.|$|R
25|$|Depending {{upon the}} path of the ball, the batsman will either move forward or back in his attempt to {{intercept}} it. A forward movement is designated a front foot shot, whereas a backwards movement is designated a back foot shot. A front foot shot is typically used to address a ball arriving at between ankle and thigh height. The batsman will step forward towards the ball, bending his front knee to bring his bat down to the anticipated height of the ball. By moving forwards, the batsman is also able to intercept the ball immediately after it has pitched, thus nullifying any potentially dangerous <b>lateral</b> <b>movement.</b> A back foot shot is typically used to address a ball arriving at between thigh and head height. The batsman will step back and, if necessary, stand on his tip toes to raise his bat to the height of the ball. By stepping back towards the wicket, he also receives the advantage of having an extra small amount of time to react to any unexpected <b>lateral</b> <b>movement</b> or variation in bounce.|$|E
25|$|In ichthyosaurs, {{the main}} {{propulsion}} {{was provided by}} a <b>lateral</b> <b>movement</b> of the body. Early forms employed an anguilliform or eel-like movement, with undulations of the entire trunk and tail. This is usually considered rather inefficient. Later forms, like the Parvipelvia, has a shorter trunk and tail and probably used a more efficient carangiform or even thunniform movement, in which {{the last third of}} the body, respectively the tail end, is flexed only. The trunk in such species is rather stiff.|$|E
25|$|An {{interior}} vortex of {{this type}} would explain why no frequency jumps occur. Since the excess fluid in the cavity must be discharged, the jet <b>lateral</b> <b>movement</b> must be considerably larger than that found in the edge tone; this is likely {{the reason for the}} high level sound. The flow over the edge results in an applied force and a dipole-like sound field. The characteristic speed must be U the jet exit speed. The characteristic dimension must be D, the cavity diameter.|$|E

50|$|In 1979, Shprintzen {{advocated}} ‘tailor-made’ flaps, {{with the}} width of the flap determined by the degree of preoperative lateral pharyngeal wall adduction. According to Shprintzen, the base of the pharyngeal flap should be positioned at the site with the greatest level of <b>lateral</b> pharyngeal wall <b>movement.</b> In addition, Shprintzen recommends that a narrower flap be used with pronounced <b>lateral</b> pharyngeal wall <b>movement,</b> while a wider flap should be used with limited <b>lateral</b> pharyngeal wall <b>movement</b> (Sloan, 2000) Use of a narrow flap in individuals with limited preoperative <b>lateral</b> pharyngeal wall <b>movement</b> has the potential to increase <b>lateral</b> pharyngeal wall <b>movement</b> postoperatively (Karling et al., 1999).|$|R
