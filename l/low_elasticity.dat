50|$|The {{effect of}} a change in {{taxation}} level on total tax revenue depends on the good being investigated, and in particular on its price elasticity of demand. Where goods have a <b>low</b> <b>elasticity</b> of demand (they are price inelastic), an increase in tax or duty will lead to a small decrease in demand—not enough to offset the higher tax raised from each unit. Overall tax revenue will therefore rise. Conversely, for price-elastic goods, an increase in tax rate or duty would lead to a fall in tax revenue.|$|E

50|$|The {{platform}} is permanently moored {{by means of}} tethers or tendons grouped {{at each of the}} structure's corners. A group of tethers is called a tension leg.

This allows the platform to have the production wellheads on deck (connected directly to the subsea wells by rigid risers), instead of on the seafloor.

50|$|With price discrimination, (the bottom diagram), {{the demand}} curve {{is divided into}} two {{segments}} (D1 and D2). A higher price (P1) is charged to the <b>low</b> <b>elasticity</b> segment, and a lower price (P2) is charged to the high elasticity segment. The total revenue from the first segment is equal to the area P1,B, Q1,O. The total revenue from the second segment is equal to the area E, C,Q2,Q1. The sum of these areas will always be greater than the area without discrimination assuming the demand curve resembles a rectangular hyperbola with unitary elasticity. The more prices that are introduced, the greater the sum of the revenue areas, and the more of the consumer surplus is captured by the producer.|$|E
50|$|Some {{argue that}} {{countries}} with {{national health care}} may use waiting lists {{as a form of}} rationing compared to countries that ration by price, such as the United States, according to several commentators and healthcare experts. The Washington Post columnist Ezra Klein compared 27% of Canadians reportedly waiting four months or more for elective surgery with 26% of Americans reporting that they did not fulfill a prescription due to cost (compared to only 6% of Canadians). Britain's former age-based policy that once prevented the use of kidney dialysis as treatment for older patients with renal problems, even to those who can privately afford the costs, has been cited as another example. A 1999 study in the Journal of Public Economics analyzed the British National Health Service and found that its waiting times function as an effective market disincentive, with a <b>low</b> <b>elasticity</b> of demand with respect to time.|$|E
5000|$|Elastic {{currency}} (magnitude of {{the money}} multiplier): the success of monetary policy {{is dependent on the}} ability to strongly influence the supply of money available to the citizens.

40|$|The {{response}} of the economy to two major [...] although in important respects offsetting [...] tax reforms has been much smaller than ardent supply-side revolutionaries expected, thus suggesting that a reassessment of the grounds for revolt is in order. This paper offers such a reassessment by first discussing how the evidence from the tax reforms of 1981 and 1986 reflects on {{our understanding of the}} response to taxation [...] with particular reference to savings and capital gains realizations. I then reconstruct a 1992 view about how taxes affect behavior. A unifying theme is that the tax system does much more than alter the relative prices of real variables [...] it also provides incentives to misreport income, restructure financial claims, time transactions, change the legal form of organization, and so on. For this reason, observed <b>low</b> tax <b>elasticities</b> of real variables may be due to either <b>low</b> <b>elasticities</b> of substitution or the fact that tax policy changes opportunity sets in complex ways. Disentangling these explanations requires an emphasis on the transaction-based nature of the tax system and the administration and enforcement of tax laws. ...|$|R

Next, we develop nonparametric procedures to estimate labor supply elasticities based on the graphical evidence and mandated financial incentives. We estimate elasticities of 0. 12 for men and 0. 38 for women. These relatively <b>low</b> <b>elasticities</b> highlight that many retirement decisions are likely to be affected by factors beyond only financial incentives from retirement benefits. ...|$|R
5000|$|... ==Pricing {{based on}} value or elasticity== Ideally, {{companies}} should ask {{the price for}} a product which {{is equal to the}} value a consumer attaches to a product. This is called value-based pricing. As this value can differ from person to person, it is difficult to uncover the perfect value and have a differentiated price for every person. However, consumer's willingness-to-pay {{can be used as a}} proxy for the perceived value. With the price elasticity of products, companies can calculate how many consumers are willing to pay for the product at each price point. Products with high elasticities are highly sensitive to changes in price, while products with low elasticities are less sensitive to price changes (ceteris paribus). Subsequently, products with <b>low</b> <b>elasticity</b> are typically valued more by consumers if everything else is equal. The dynamic aspect of this pricing method is that elasticities change with respect to product, category, time, location and retailers. With the price elasticity of products the margin of the product, retailers can use this method with their pricing strategy to aim for volume, revenue or profit maximization strategies.|$|E
