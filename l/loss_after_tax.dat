50|$|A more {{accurate}} method of calculating this price {{is to look}} at the share price and dividend from the after-tax perspective of a share holder. The after-tax drop in the share price (or capital gain/loss) should be equivalent to the after-tax dividend. For example, if the tax of capital gains Tcg is 35%, and the tax on dividends Td is 15%, then a £1 dividend is equivalent to £0.85 of <b>after</b> <b>tax</b> money. To get the same financial benefit from a capital <b>loss,</b> the <b>after</b> <b>tax</b> capital <b>loss</b> value should equal £0.85. The pre-tax capital loss would be £0.85/(1-Tcg) = £0.85/(1-35%) = £0.85/65% = £1.30. In this case, a dividend of £1 has led to a larger drop in the share price of £1.30, because the tax rate on capital losses is higher than the dividend tax rate.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} is to acknowledge {{the result of the}} application of accounting for income tax according PSAK 46 and the presentation impacts in the financial statement. According PSAK 46 it is compulsory for all companies to realize the tax consequences in the future as a result of temporary differences. The temporary differences are caused by the differences between commercial book value and fiscal book value deductible temporary differences or taxable temporary differences in the future. The recognition of the differences in tax as the result of temporary differences in PSAK 46 was done by using assets liability approach. So far the tax earning in the company was been measured by using taxable method. In taxable method the tax expense has the same amount as taxable. So the company had not used the application of PSAK 46 in their financial statement. After applying PSAK 46 the balance sheet of the company at the end of 2005 and 2006 showed that the company must recognized that deferred tax assets as much as 69. 704. 719, 13 in 2005 and 67. 394. 185, 25 in 2006.

A reduction in capital tax rates generates substantial dynamic responses within the frame-work of the standard neoclassical growth model. The short-run revenue <b>loss</b> <b>after</b> a <b>tax</b> cut is partly or, depending on parameter values, even completely o¤set by growth in the long-run, due to the resulting incentives to further accumulate capital. We study how the dynamic response of government revenue to a tax cut changes if we allow a Ramsey econ-omy to engage in international trade: the open economys ability to reallocate resources between labor-intensive and capital-intensive industries reduces the negative e¤ect of fac-tor accumulation on factor returns, thus encouraging the economy to accumulate more than it would do under autarky. We explore the quantitative implications of this intuition for the US in terms of two issues recently treated in the literature: dynamic scoring and the La¤er curve.

40|$|The {{legal and}} {{strategic}} framework for regional {{development in the}} Republic of Croatia, which includes the development of entrepreneurship, was established almost twenty years after Croatia had gained independence. Until then, less developed areas, i. e., areas with a special status in terms of certain reliefs and exemptions granted to citizens and economic entities had been supported through individual laws. Today, government authorities stimulate entrepreneurial activity through individual regulations in force, by corporate income tax exemptions. The state gives back corporate income tax (tax liability not subject to exemptions) that taxpayers engaged in entrepreneurial activities had paid up to the state budget, to local self-government units as assistance from the state budget. By doing so, the government aims to reduce {{the gap between the}} developed and underdeveloped parts of the Republic of Croatia and encourage entrepreneurial activity in the smaller and less developed regions. The indicators of entrepreneurial activity in the area supported by the state: the number of enterprises, number of employees in an enterprise, the total revenue generated by entrepreneurial activities, profit and <b>loss</b> <b>after</b> <b>tax</b> and net operating profit/loss, provide insight into the performance of enterprises. In view of the above, the authors have analyzed the performance of enterprises entitled to tax relief in the areas of special state concern and provided an overview of financial resources (tax revenue) which state authorities have waived to facilitate a more competitive business performance...|$|E
