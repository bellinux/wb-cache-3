The persistency of work <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> only justify {{the feeling that the}} root of this un-American warfare is due, not so much to what is seen or known of the deeds of missionaries, but the opposition to Christianity itself. The purpose was fixed before China was reached at all, and this murderous spirit stops not at injustice to individuals.|$|E
500|$|In maturity, the exoperidium {{at the top}} of the puffball sloughs away, {{revealing}} a pre-formed hole (ostiole) in the endoperidium, through which the spores can escape. In young puffballs, the internal contents, the gleba, is white and firm, but turns brown and powdery as the spores mature. [...] The gleba contains minute chambers that are lined with hymenium (the fertile, spore-bearing tissue); the chambers collapse when the spores mature. Mature puffballs release their powdery spores through the ostiole when they are compressed by touch or falling raindrops. A study of the spore release mechanism in L.pyriforme using high-speed schlieren photography determined that raindrops of 1mm diameter or greater, including rain drips from nearby trees, were sufficient to cause spore discharge. The puffed spores are ejected from the ostiole at a velocity of about 100cm/second to form a centimeter-tall cloud one-hundredth of a second after impact. A single puff <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> release over a million spores.|$|E
500|$|Vergne {{was angry}} with d'Ambrosio's {{defensive}} driving {{and found the}} manner d'Ambrosio performed the manoeuvres as not being [...] "acceptable and fair". He described d'Ambrosio's tactics as [...] "totally stupid" [...] and that it prevented him from winning the race and questioned his intelligence. Vergne revealed that d'Ambrosio {{wanted to have a}} conservation about the manoeuvres but Vergne did not wish to speak to him. D'Ambrosio argued that his defensive driving was fair, saying that he was doing his own race. He argued that in the event that the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, felt he was overly aggressive, he would be notified and issued a warning D'Ambrosio said that from his point of view, he steered into the corner early and argued that he did not change his line: [...] "Sure, I didn’t give much space but this is racing. I understand it can be frustrating but everyone is doing their own race and it’s what the fans want to see.” He felt he could have achieved a maximum finishing position of fifth but the energy targets displayed on his steering wheel dashboard did not match those provided to him by Dragon, which caused him to push hard until his team realised they were mistaken. Vergne changed his verdict on the clash weeks later after admitting he was not aware that d'Ambrosio had incorrect information relayed to him and felt he had performed [...] "a great race". [...] "Things <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> happen. I don't think there are any more worries about it", he said.|$|E

500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "Fresh Blood" [...] was viewed by an estimated 2.88 million viewers. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. Tina Charles of TV Guide praised the episode, commenting that [...] "it {{was really nice}} to get an enjoyable episode high on intensity, brotherly interaction, blood and gore". Although she had grown a [...] "tad bit weary" [...] of the character's continuous attempts to kill Sam, she was still [...] "really sorry to see Sterling and Gordy go". Charles felt that his transformation was a [...] "good twist", and liked that his [...] "black-and-white beliefs" [...] remained the same even after becoming a vampire. She also enjoyed the character of Lucy and her [...] "really sad" [...] ending, and wished that McNab's role had been larger. It was noted that the [...] "brotherly interaction was front and center", and Charles was [...] "beyond happy" [...] that Sam confronted Dean about is behavior. The [...] "moment that [...] been waiting for all season long" [...] finally came to be when Dean took Sam seriously and actually listened to him instead of replying with sarcasm. Charles also deemed the final scene with the brothers to be [...] "just heartbreaking". Likewise, Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune not only gave the episode an A+, but ranked it as the sixth-best episode of the 2007-2008 television season. She praised writer Sera Gamble and director Kim Manners for [...] "creating the best bonding scene we've had all season", and lauded Padalecki and Ackles for [...] "making us care so much and believe so fully that a scene <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> leave us gasping".|$|E
500|$|The Guardians Andrew Pulver {{was less}} enthusiastic, calling the film {{a mix of}} [...] "wafer-thin psychodrama" [...] and [...] "plot-generator dialogue". Times Richard Corliss said the action was let down by [...] "inert" [...] drama, {{describing}} the film as [...] "45 minutes of awesome encased in 90 minutes of yawnsome." [...] Justin Chang of Variety criticized it as loud and lacking the nuance and subtlety of del Toro's previous films. The New Yorkers Anthony Lane's verdict read as [...] "It is possible to applaud Pacific Rim for the efficacy of its business model while deploring the tale that has been engendered—long, loud, dark, and very wet. You might as well watch the birth of an elephant." [...] The San Francisco Chronicles Mike LaSalle reacted extremely negatively by stating [...] "If {{this is the best}} we can do in terms of movies—hoif something <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> speak to the soul of audiences—maybe we should just turn over the cameras and the equipment to the alien dinosaurs and see what they come up with… Director Guillermo del Toro, who gave us Pan's Labyrinth not too many years ago, used to be known as an artistic and discerning filmmaker, despite his affection for blockbuster action and grotesqueness. But too often he gets lost in his computer…Why go to the movies to look at somebody else's computer after looking at your own all week?… The actors can't make Pacific Rim any better. They can only relieve some of the pain." [...] Slant Magazines Ed Gonzalez, who said the film lacked poignancy, compared it to a video game: [...] "a stylish but programmatic ride toward an inevitable final boss battle". The Wraps Alonso Duralde criticized the choice to set most battles at night or during the rain, feeling it detracted from the action, and said the comic relief actors—Day, Gorman, and Perlman—stole the film from the less interesting leads. Jordan Hoffman of Film.com identified Hunnam as the weak link in the cast, calling him a [...] "charisma black hole". Giles Hardie of The Sydney Morning Herald was particularly critical of the film, awarding the action sequences [...] "five IQ points out of five" [...] as he described the film as an hour and twenty minutes of fight sequences vaguely connected by ten minutes of story.|$|E

2500|$|Fear of {{the unknown}} or irrational fear is caused by {{negative}} thinking (worry) which arises from anxiety accompanied with a subjective sense of apprehension or dread. Irrational fear like any other fears share common neural pathway that engages to mobilize bodily resources {{in the face of}} threat. Many people are scared of the [...] "unknown". The irrational fear can branch out to many areas such as the hereafter, the next ten years, or even tomorrow. Chronic irrational fear has deleterious effects since the elicitor stimulus is commonly absent or perceived from delusions. In these cases specialists use False Evidence Appearing Real as a definition. Such fear can create comorbidity with the anxiety disorder umbrella. Being scared may cause people to experience anticipatory fear of what may lie ahead rather than planning and evaluating for the same. E.g. Continuation of scholarly education, most educators perceive this as a risk that may cause them fear and stress and they would rather teach things they've been taught than go and do research, this can lead to habits such as laziness and procrastination. The ambiguity of a situations that tend to be uncertain and unpredictable can cause anxiety, other psychological and physical problems in some populations; especially those who engage it constantly. E.g. War-ridden or Conflict places, Terrorism, Abuse ...etc. Poor parenting that instills fear can also debilitate children's psyche development or personality. E.g. Parents tell their children not to talk to strangers in order to protect them. In school they would be motivated to not show fear in talking with strangers, but to be assertive and also aware of the risks and the environment that it takes place. Ambiguous and mixed messages <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> affect their self-esteem and self-confidence. Researchers say talking to strangers isn't something to be thwarted but allowed in a parent's presence if required. Developing [...] a sense of equanimity to handle various situations is often advocated as an antidote to irrational fear and essential skill by a number of ancient philosophies.|$|E
2500|$|Coonan's casting as Carl was {{announced}} on 6 May 2013, {{when it was}} revealed that the character is Kirsty Branning's (Kierston Wareing) ex-boyfriend and has been in prison, where he had shared a cell with Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). Coonan said of his casting, [...] "EastEnders {{has been a part of}} my life since I was 12 years old. I even remember talking about the storylines in school playgrounds in Tottenham and I am very happy and proud to now be a small part of its life." [...] Executive producer Lorraine Newman said: [...] "It's wonderful to have Daniel Coonan joining us in Walford to play Carl White. Oozing confidence and with a dangerous edge, will Kirsty be able to resist his bad boy charms for long, or can [...] Max [...] save her from the lure of the dark side?" [...] This is Coonan's second role in EastEnders, as he played David Priors in 2011. Coonan said the four-episode role helped him prepare for a bigger role in the programme, though describing his first day on set as Carl, he said, [...] "it still hits you when you walk on to the Square for the very first time. It's like walking into your TV." [...] Coonan filmed his first scene on the Bridge Street market set. Heat reported that Carl's introduction was part of a [...] "rescue plan" [...] to increase ratings for EastEnders, especially with the announced departures of popular characters Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner), Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) and Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), saying [...] "with ever-dwindling ratings and an unusually bare trophy cabinet, producers have been forced to plan some major shake-ups in an attempt to revive the ailing drama with new characters, returning familiar faces and exciting storylines." [...] Coonan later said of being cast, [...] "When they offered the part of Carl to me, I thought about it as long as it takes to blink your eyelids. I knew it would be a great character and fun to play. Something <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> massively raise your profile. I'm beaming into thousands of people's homes four times a week." [...] Coonan was originally contracted to appear in 28 episodes over a six-month period, but instead filmed over 60 episodes. After Danny Dyer was cast as Mick Carter in the show, he revealed that he was approached to play Carl.|$|E
