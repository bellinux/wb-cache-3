Aside from including a string section, the track features Simpson's breathy vocals, spoken passages and a mid-section breakdown, where her vocals are [...] "funk-fortified". According to author Ben Graham, the lyrics of the song see Simpson stripping her famous virginity image down. Bob Waliszewski of Plugged In gave a similar observation of the lyrics, writing that they point to an imminent sexual compromise.

The lyrics also demand healthy changes in her relationship. [...] "Forever In Your Eyes" [...] explores elements of Latin music, as the song is backed by Spanish guitar and infused with hip-hop beats. The lyrics describe a couple in love lying together [...] "all through the night". [...] "There You Were" [...] is a torchy power ballad which drew comparisons to Simpson's previous song [...] "Where You Are" [...] (2000). The lyrics of the song are a homage to the protagonist's partner, who changed her life. The song received negative response from critics, with some calling it [...] "sappy" [...] and [...] "unnecessary". [...] "What's It Gonna Be" [...] is a bubblegum pop song influenced by '80s funk music, which was compared to outtakes from Spears' Oops!... I Did It Again (2000). The lyrics deal with Simpson expecting a reply from her lover regarding his fear of commitment.|$|E

In Wuthering Heights the reader is shocked, disgusted, almost sickened by details of cruelty, inhumanity, and the most diabolical hate and vengeance, and anon come passages of powerful testimony to the supreme power of love– even over demons in the human form. The women in the book are of a strange fiendish-angelic nature, tantalising, and terrible, and the men are indescribable out of the book itself. Yet, towards the close of the story occurs the following pretty, soft picture, which comes like the rainbow after a storm...

Mullen admits that he was upset that the band entered the studio without him, cognizant that key decisions would be made in the early months of recording.
