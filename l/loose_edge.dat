40|$|Abstract. Zaslavsky proved in 2012 that, up to {{switching}} isomorphism, {{there are}} six different signed Petersen graphs {{and that they could}} be told apart by their chromatic polynomials, by showing that the latter give distinct results when evaluated at 3. He conjectured that the six different signed Petersen graphs also have distinct zero-free chromatic polynomials, and that both types of chromatic polynomials have distinct evaluations at any positive integer. We developed and executed a computer program (running in SAGE) that efficiently determines the number of proper k-colorings for a given signed graph; our computations for the signed Petersen graphs confirm Zaslavsky’s conjecture. We also computed the chromatic polynomials of all signed complete graphs with up to five vertices. Graph coloring problems are ubiquitous in many areas within and outside of mathematics. We are interested in certain enumerative questions about coloring signed graphs. A signed graph Σ = (Γ, σ) consists of a graph Γ = (V,E) and a signature σ ∈ {±}E. The underlying graph Γ may have multiple edges and, besides the usual links and loops, also half edges (with only one endpoint) and <b>loose</b> <b>edges</b> (no endpoints); the last are irrelevant for coloring questions, and so we assume in this paper that Σ has no <b>loose</b> <b>edges.</b> An unsigned graph can be realized by a signed graph all of whose edge...|$|R

This study provides a comprehensive {{description of the}} tissue organization of non- deformed and deformed opercula and vertebrae from gilthead sea bream Sparus aurata juveniles by means of histological, histochemical and immunohistochemical approaches. Two types of oper- cular anomalies are described: the folding of the opercle and subopercle into the gill chamber, starting at the upper corner of the branchial cleft and extending down to its lower third; and the partial lack of the operculum (opercle, subopercle, interopercle and preopercle underdeveloped) with a regression of the <b>loose</b> <b>edge</b> extending down to its lower third. Histological observations revealed a rare type of bone remodelling process in the opercular structure, which consisted of the coalescence of contacting bone tissues (presumably from the preopercle and opercle), resulting in skeletal tissue with a trabecular aspect filled by a single-cell epithelium of cubic osteoblastic-like cells. Differences in collagen fiber thickness and its 3 -dimensional arrangement between normal and deformed opercula were also found. Lordotic vertebrae were characterized by the formation of fibrous cartilage in the haemal and/or neural sides, indicating that a metaplastic shift occurred {{during the process of}} lordosis. Another major histomorphological change found in lordotic verte- brae was the complete loss of notochordal sheath integrity. Histological alterations were coupled with an imbalance of cell death and cell proliferation processes in lordotic vertebrae {{as well as that of}} bone formation/resorption, and extracellular matrix deposition activity differences which might have resulted from the remodelling process occurring in lordotic vertebrae. Altogether, these results provide an increase in our basic knowledge of bone disorders that contribute to our under-standing of the mechanisms by which these skeletal anomalies appear in this fish species and which hamper its production efficiency. © The authors 2014.
