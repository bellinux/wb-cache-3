40|$|Molecular {{diagnostic}} {{testing has}} become an important tool in clinical <b>laboratories.</b> <b>Accreditation</b> {{according to the international}} quality standard ISO 15189 : 2007 for medical laboratories is required for reimbursement of several molecular diagnostic tests in Belgium. Since the ISO 15189 : 2007 standard applies to medical laboratories in general, the particular requirements for quality and competence are mentioned in general terms, not taking into account the specificities of molecular biology testing. Therefore, the working group "MolecularDiagnostics. be" described a consensus interpretation of chapter 5, Technical requirements, of the ISO standard for application in molecular diagnostic laboratories. The manuscript can be used as an instrument to prepare internal and external audits that meet the ISO 15189 : 2007 (chapter 5) criteria. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Medical <b>Laboratories</b> <b>Accreditation</b> {{is covered}} by ISO 15189 : 2012 - Medical Laboratories — Requirements for Quality and Competence. In Portugal, {{accreditation}} processes are held {{under the auspices of}} the Portuguese Accreditation Institute (IPAC), which applies the Portuguese edition (NP EN ISO 15189 : 2014). Accordingly, Medical <b>Laboratories</b> <b>accreditation</b> processes now require the estimate of measurement uncertainty (MU) associated to the results. The Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) describes the calculation of MU, not contemplating the specific aspects of medical laboratory testing. Several models have been advocated, yet without a final consensus. Given the lack of studies on MU in Portugal, especially on its application in the medical laboratory, it is the objective of this thesis to reach to a model that fulfils the IPAC’s accreditation regulations, in regards to this specific requirement. The study was based on the implementation of two formulae (MU-A and MU-B), using the Quality Management System (QMS) data of an ISO 15189 Accredited Laboratory. Including the laboratory’s two Cobas® 6000 –c 501 (Roche®) analysers (C 1 and C 2) the work focused three analytes: creatinine, glucose and total cholesterol. The MU-B model formula, combining the standard uncertainties of the method’s imprecision, of the calibrator’s assigned value and from the pre-analytical variation, was considered the one best fitting to the laboratory's objectives and to the study's purposes, representing well the dispersion of values reasonably attributable to the measurand final result. Expanded Uncertainties were: Creatinine - C 1 = 9, 60 %; C 2 = 5, 80 %; Glucose - C 1 = 8, 32 %; C 2 = 8, 34 %; Cholesterol - C 1 = 4, 00 %; C 2 = 3, 54 %. [...] . [cont. ]...|$|R

Under this philosophy, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) started a forensic toxicology proficiency-testing (PT) program in July 1991. In continuation of the first seven years of the PT findings reported earlier, PT findings of the next seven years are summarized herein. Twenty-eight survey samples (12 urine, 9 blood, and 7 tissue homogenate) with/without alcohols/volatiles, drugs, and/or putrefactive amine(s) were submitted to an average of 31 laboratories, of which an average of 25 participants returned their results. Analytes in survey samples were correctly identified and quantitated by a large number of participants, but some false positives of concern were reported.
