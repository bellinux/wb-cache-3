40|$|Suceava river basin, suprapus {{over the}} eastern {{slopes of the}} Eastern Carpathian and over the Suceava Plateau, is {{strongly}} influenced by the climatic characteristics of tis area, such as very low temperatures during winter, creating a long period with freezing river water. This is why winter is the main season with <b>low</b> <b>waters,</b> when the river discharge drops below a certain values, threating the water supplying for the settlements in the basin, even the depletion of rivers. As follows, there will be presented these periods in which the river’s discharge value drops below a threshold value, specific for <b>low</b> <b>waters</b> using the program HydroOffice. Thiss program helped us better calculating the parameters of <b>low</b> <b>waters,</b> such as their duration, frequency, intensity (severity), minimum discharge, etc. All these will show that this river basin belongs to the Eastern Carpathian water flow regime, with the highest frequency of <b>low</b> <b>waters</b> during winter, followed by autumn <b>low</b> <b>waters...</b>|$|R

Tropical Storm Doria passed about 160miles (260km) east of Charleston, South Carolina, though its large wind field produced 22mph (35km/h) winds in the town. The storm also dropped light rainfall of up to 1.75inches (44mm), and resulted in a storm tide of 5.7feet (1.7m) above the mean <b>low</b> <b>water</b> level.|$|E

5|$|Agricultural {{runoff from}} farms and ranches in the Snake River Plain {{and many other}} areas has {{severely}} damaged {{the ecology of the}} river throughout the 20thcentury. After the first irrigation dams on the river began operation {{in the first decade of}} the 20thcentury, much of the arable land in a strip a few miles wide along the Snake River was cultivated or turned to pasture, and agricultural return flows began to pollute the Snake. Runoff from several feedlots was dumped into the river until laws made the practice illegal. Fertilizer, manure and other chemicals and pollutants washed into the river greatly increase the nutrient load, especially of phosphorus, fecal coliforms and nitrogen. During <b>low</b> <b>water,</b> algae blooms occur throughout the calm stretches of the river, depleting its oxygen supply.|$|E

5|$|During {{the height}} of the typhoon at Cabras Island on Guam, a {{gasoline}} tank caught fire, believed to be from friction caused by extremely high winds running through its ventilation system. The tank exploded, sending its lid airborne and spreading the fire to other nearby tanks. The proximity of the tanks as well as <b>low</b> <b>water</b> pressure hampered firefighting efforts, and the fire was extinguished five days later; it resulted in three destroyed gasoline tanks with two more caught on fire. While the fire was burning, transportation of gasoline from the port to the rest of Guam was suspended resulting in a halt in gasoline sales for the general public.|$|E

5|$|Marasmius rotula is a {{saprobic}} {{species and}} as such obtains nutrients by decomposing dead organic matter. It grows in deciduous forests and fruits in groups or clusters on dead wood (especially beech), woody debris such as twigs or sticks, and occasionally on rotting leaves. The fruit bodies, which are easily overlooked because of their diminutive size, are often present in abundance after rains. The species is relatively intolerant of <b>low</b> <b>water</b> potentials, and will grow poorly {{or not at all}} under water stress conditions. It is unable to degrade leaf litter until it becomes more fragmented and more compacted so that the water-holding capacity increases in the deeper layers of the soil. The magnolia warbler has been noted to line its nests with the fruit bodies' stems.|$|E

5|$|On the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Hurricane Isabel {{produced}} a storm surge peaking at 8feet (2.4m) on the Chesapeake Bay in Hoopers Island and 6.5feet (2m) on the Atlantic coast in Ocean City.

Tolchester Beach recorded a record-breaking high tide of 7.91feet (2.4m) above mean <b>low</b> <b>water.</b> Rainfall in the Maryland portion of the Delmarva Peninsula reached 3.2inches (81mm) in Steeles Neck.

5|$|Sedimentological {{data from}} the Mussentuchit Member {{indicates}} that Eolambia lived on a poorly-drained floodplain, around a system of large, perennial lakes. The lakes fluctuated between high and <b>low</b> <b>water</b> levels in Milankovitch cycles of roughly 21,000 years, caused by the Earth's axial precession. These cycles is reflected by the alternating layers of muddy sandstone and mudstone in present-day rock deposits. During dry periods, the exposed lakebed formed a broad beach devoid of plants. The cracked mud of the lakebed produced mud clasts, while organic debris and scavenged carcasses were scattered around the water's edge as the lake progressively retreated. Meanwhile, during periods in which the sea level rose, small rivers invaded the floodplain, which reworked and displaced the debris that had been deposited during the dry season.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{radiation}} is {{absorbed by the}} Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is <b>low,</b> <b>water</b> vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the water cycle. The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclones and anti-cyclones. Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14°C. By photosynthesis, green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} the zooplankton abundance {{and composition of}} Laguna Grande, a floodplain wetland of the Lower Paraná Basin (Argentina), during an extraordinary drought–flood cycle that affected both {{the environment and the}} biological conditions of the lake. <b>Low</b> <b>waters</b> were characterised by remarkably high conductivities and pH values, and high phytoplankton and bacterioplankton abundances with cyanobacterial blooms, while high waters showed opposite features. In relation to zooplankton, the mean abundances of all the taxonomic groups (rotifers, cladocerans, copepods, ciliates, and heterotrophic nanoflagellates) were slightly higher at <b>low</b> <b>waters.</b> Major changes were observed in the specific composition of metazooplankton: the euryhaline species assemblage that dominated in the dry warm period was replaced by several oligohaline littoral and planktonic species characteristic of the Paraná River Basin, when the water level rose. Mean species richness values at high waters doubled those of <b>low</b> <b>waters</b> and were directly correlated to water depth. Most of the rotifers of the genus Brachionus and the cladoceran Moina micrura switched from parthenogenetic to sexual reproduction during <b>low</b> <b>waters,</b> as a response to a harsh environment and crowding. We suggest that the main changes in the environmental conditions in this eutrophic floodplain lake are driven by the hydrology, which regulates the zooplankton succession. The herein described shifts in the zooplankton structure and dynamics of Laguna Grande over an extraordinary drought–flood cycle contribute {{to the understanding of the}} processes that might occur under the scenarios predicted by climate change models...|$|R
40|$|The Amazon {{floodplain}} lakes {{are subject}} to yearly fluctuations of water levels and rivers and/or igarapés contributions that have influence in their limnological and biological characteristics. Among the organisms found in the plankton the Pinnularia genus stands out as representative in number of species. This study aims to evaluate the richness of Pinnularia in the Tupé Lake, Rio Negro Basin and its hydrological cycle relation. Samplings with plankton net were carried out in bimonthly scale in three different stations in this lake, covering falling and <b>low</b> <b>waters</b> periods (2002 / 2003) and the rising and high waters (2003 / 2004). The {{results showed that the}} falling – <b>low</b> <b>waters</b> period presented a significantly higher richness (52 taxa) in comparison to the rising – high waters period, when we observed 33 taxa. The highest richness in the falling – <b>low</b> <b>waters</b> period is probably related to waters coming from “igarapés” and the vertical circulation of the water column, which in this period keeps a greater interface between water-sediment promoting the benthic organisms suspension in the system.
