40|$|Identifying and {{tracking}} {{cells in the}} brain is a challenging task, requiring advanced molecular biology techniques and precise anatomical information. We have applied the principle of RGB marking to the <b>long-term</b> <b>marking</b> {{and tracking}} of progenitor and mature cells in the adult brain. Briefly, multicolor RGB marking {{is based on the}} simultaneous, lentiviral vector-mediated expression of three genes encoding fluorescent proteins in the three basic colors (red, green, and blue). Here, we show the application of RGB marking to the stable multicolor marking of adult granule cells in the hippocampus. This technique provides each individual cell with a characteristic hue, which facilitates their anatomical identification and spatial tracking. Multicolor RBG marking of mature neurons can provide an effective approach to dissect the function of individual cells, as it allows combination with functional techniques, facilitating the understanding of complex neuronal populations such as that of the dentate gyrus...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. [...] A tag was {{developed}} and tested for the <b>long-term</b> <b>marking</b> of spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias). The tag is retained without corrosion and with minor skin abrasion. They have not been lost from fish held in captivity for up to 3 years. Most recoveries were in the immediate release area, but some fish were recovered 250 to 7, 000 km from the release area. The greatest distance travelled (7, 000 km) was by a fish tagged in June 1980 in Queen Charlotte Sound and recovered in November 1982 off the northeast coast of Japan. The recovery rate for fish tagged and released in the Strait of Georgia and standardized for catch suggested that movement of spiny dogfish throughout heir range is {{an important aspect of}} their biology. Less movement was exhibited by fish tagged in the Hecate Strait region. However, of the fish that did move, the majority were recaptured off Washington and the west coast of Vancouver Island and not in the Strait of Georgia. Spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) have been an important commercial species off the west coast of Canada and are perceived by fishermen to be a serious predator of other commercially important species.

40|$|Lentiviral vectors are {{attractive}} for {{hematopoietic stem cell}} (HSC) gene therapy {{because they do not}} require mitosis for nuclear entry, they efficiently transduce hematopoietic repopulating cells, and self-inactivating (SIN) designs can be produced at high titer. Experiments to evaluate HIV-derived lentiviral vectors in nonhuman primates prior to clinical trials have been hampered by low transduction frequencies due in part to host restriction by TRIM 5 α. We have established conditions for efficient transduction of pigtailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) long-term repopulating cells using VSV-G–pseudotyped HIV-based lentiviral vectors. Stable, long-term, high-level gene marking was observed in 3 macaques using relatively low MOIs (5 - 10) in a 48 -hour ex vivo transduction protocol. All animals studied had rapid neutrophil engraftment with a median of 10. 3 days to a count greater than 0. 5 × 109 /L (500 /μL). Expression was detected in all lineages, with <b>long-term</b> <b>marking</b> levels in granulocytes at approximately 20 % to 30 %, and in lymphocytes at approximately 12 % to 23 %.

40|$|Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is {{associated}} with significant morbidity and mortality from infection. The first CGD gene therapy trial resulted in only short-term marking of 0. 01 % to 0. 1 % of neutrophils. A recent study, using busulfan conditioning and an SFFV retrovirus vector, achieved more than 20 % marking in 2 patients with X-linked CGD. However, oxidase correction per marked neutrophil was less than normal and not sustained. Despite this, patients clearly benefited in that severe infections resolved. As such, we initiated a gene therapy trial for X-CGD to treat severe infections unresponsive to conventional therapy. We treated 3 adult patients using busulfan conditioning and an MFGS retroviral vector encoding gp 91 phox, achieving early marking of 26 %, 5 %, and 4 % of neutrophils, respectively, with sustained <b>long-term</b> <b>marking</b> of 1. 1 % and 0. 03 % of neutrophils in 2 of the patients. Gene-marked neutrophils have sustained full correction of oxidase activity for 34 and 11 months, respectively, with full or partial resolution of infection in those 2 patients. Gene marking is polyclonal with no clonal dominance. We conclude that busulfan conditioning together with an MFGS vector is capable of achieving long-term correction of neutrophil oxidase function sufficient to provide benefit in management of severe infection.

40|$|Leatherbacks {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{endangered}} species of sea turtles. Their global population size had decreased dramatically over the past several decades. Difficulties in applying <b>long-term</b> <b>marking</b> methods on leatherbacks, have significantly hindered our ability to generate an accurate population estimate and to track population changes on the scale of individuals. External marking methods are plagued by high rates of tag loss which compromise the utility of tagging as a means of long-term identification. While having substantially better retention rates, the high cost PIT tags and the specialized equipment necessary to detect them, have limited the expansion of this technique. This project outlined the need for innovative approaches to identifying turtles and sought to resolve some of the issues plaguing traditional tagging protocols by reinvestigating the feasibility of using photo-identification to recognize individual leatherbacks. Pioneering studies of pink spot photo-identification by McDonald and Dutton (1996) showed that the pineal spot of the leatherback is distinct enough to be used as a unique identifier. This research investigated whether individual turtles could be recognized by their “pink spot” when a large sample (~ 400) was drawn from a very large nesting population (~ 3, 000 nesting annually). It also sought to determine whether identification could be automated using photo-identification software. The results indicated that the pineal “pink” spot’s form has sufficient variation to be used as a unique identifier in photo-identification studies. Using the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) function we were able to successfully automate identification. Through a cascade filtering approach the program was able to achieve one hundred percent matching accuracy, while eliminating the possibility of false negatives. Further studies are required to examine the degree of deviation that may occur within the pink spot over time, and to refine our methodologies to expand the use of this method amongst leatherback researchers...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. disseration. March 2015. Major: Conservation Biology. Advisor: Francesca J. Cuthbert. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiii, 135 pages, appendices 1 - 2. The piping plover (Charadrius melodus) {{is a small}} shorebird endemic to North America and restricted to three breeding populations: Atlantic Coast, Great Plains, and Great Lakes. Listed as federally endangered in 1986, the Great Lakes population has numbered from 17 to 71 known breeding pairs. Despite recovery efforts, the population {{is far from the}} federal recovery goal of 150 breeding pairs. The purpose of my dissertation research is to understand the causes and consequences of individual variation in survival and fecundity during key breeding stages through four distinct methods of investigation: life-history theory, quantitative genetic analysis, population demography, and behavioral assessment. Effective conservation of small wildlife populations requires the intersection of many scientific disciplines and I seek to achieve this unification through the four chapters of my dissertation. First, I investigate how age and parental experience with breeding, a mate, and a nesting location influence reproductive success (Chapter 1). In chapter 2, I investigate the heritabilities of three fitness-related traits (chick body mass, natal dispersal distance, and female timing of breeding) to determine which are strongly environmentally-determined and thus susceptible to impacts of global climate change. In chapter 3, I tease apart the relative influences of various developmental and environmental factors at pre-fledging, post-fledging, and adult stages to more precisely inform population recovery actions. In my final chapter, I test the hypothesis that captive-reared chicks have lower survival rates than those reared in the wild {{because of a lack of}} threat recognition. The insights gained from my research not only pertain to this small shorebird breeding in the Great Lakes, but also provide a more comprehensive framework for analyzing data on marked individuals with the goal of shaping conservation actions for an entire population. Further, the new analytical methods applied to ecologically complex data will be important to any study that uses <b>long-term</b> <b>marking.</b> Avian populations are predicted to become more threatened in the future, so it is increasingly critical to understand factors driving vital rates and to develop approaches to alleviate threats to population persistence...|$|E

40|$|Philopatry is the {{selective}} return of individual birds to breed {{close to the}} site of their own hatching. This phenomenon can greatly influence the operation of evolutionary forces within and among populations of a species. Detection of philopatry normally involves <b>long-term</b> <b>mark,</b> release, and recapture studies. As an alternative, we have applied restriction enzyme analysis of mitochondrial DNA to a colonially nesting seabird species, the Fairy Prion (Pachyptila turtur), as a test of philopatry. As the mitochondrial genome is strictly maternally inherited, each colony in a philopatric species should have a unique combination of mitochondrial haplotypes. Twenty-one prions taken from one colony all had identical mitochondrial genomes, and we argue that juveniles as well as experienced adults return to the colony to breed. Philopatry within this colony does not explain the lack of mtDNA sequence variation. The most likely explanation is the recent occurrence of either a bottleneck or founder event within the colony probably involving a maximum of four females and an unspecified number of male prions. Two additional colonies of prions were not genetically homogeneous and did not have significantly different combinations of mitochondrial DNA lineages. It was not possible to confirm the existence of philopatry in these colonies...|$|R
40|$|Avian colony size {{variation}} is an evolutionary puzzle {{in terms of}} unequal fitness payoffs. We used a <b>long-term</b> <b>marked</b> lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) population, where individual fitness increases with colony size, to test whether subordinates are evicted despotically from the largest colonies. Yearlings were smaller and lighter, were more attacked than expected, and lost most disputes over nest holes with older birds. Agonistic interactions increased with colony size; consequently, most first breeders recruited in colonies smaller than those at which they first tried to settle. As expected when subordination is a transient state, birds dispersed to a larger colony as they got older even after breeding successfully. The population consequences of these behavioral processes were that the relative frequency of yearlings and first breeders decreased with colony size. At the same time, breeding colony size was repeatable within individuals, so we estimated the amount of heritable variation in this trait. Estimates of heritability derived from parent-offspring and full-sib analyses were consistently high (h 2 = 0. 53) when individuals reached asymptotic morphological values and presumably overcame subordinate transient states. Age-related dominance asymmetries masked resemblance among relatives in colony size, but both phenomena seem to coexist in this population and explain a considerable proportion of colony size variation.

40|$|Extract] The {{conclusion}} by Souter et al. (1997) that spine pigment band count (SPBC) is not {{an appropriate}} method to estimate age in Acanthaster planci is not justified. They are incorrect {{to suggest that the}} ages derived from the SPBC method bear no relationship to the actual age of the specimen, because their study did not test the SPBC method proposed by Stump and Lucas (1990) and further confirmed by Stump (1994, 1996). Instead, Souter et al. (1997) sampled spines from all over the aboral surfaces of five specimens, including regenerated arms. They found that numbers of pigment bands declined progressively in spines away from the longest spines at the midline base of arms and were less than maximal in regenerating arms. By employing an indiscriminant sampling method, they showed a potential for spines from adult A. planci to have variation in banding patterns. However, the SPBC method recognizes spine banding variation within individuals and specifies that the longest spines must be carefully sampled from the proximal area of whole arms; this allows for possible effects from spine autotomy, sublethal predation and regeneration. In addition, the interpretation of their results is not well founded. Ultimately, the testing of the validity of age-determining methods can be achieved only through medium-term to <b>long-term</b> <b>mark</b> recapture studies or by identifying known-age individuals in populations (Beamish and McFarlane 1983) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{biology and}} {{distribution}} of the threatened Mountain Crayfish Euastacus sulcatus, was examined through widespread sampling and a <b>long-term</b> <b>mark</b> and recapture program in New South Wales. Crayfish surveys were undertaken at 245 regional sites between 2001 and 2005, and the species was recorded at 27 sites in the Clarence, Richmond and Tweed River drainages of New South Wales, including the only three historic sites of record in the state, Brindle Creek, Mount Warning and Richmond Range. The species was restricted to highland, forested sites (220 - 890 m above sea level), primarily in national park and state forest reserves. Adult crayfish disappear from the observable population during the cooler months, re-emerging in October when the reproductive season commences. Females mature at approximately 50 mm OCL, and all mature females engage in breeding during a mass spawning season in spring, carrying 45 - 600 eggs. Eggs take six to seven weeks to develop, and the hatched juveniles remain within the clutch for a further 2. 5 weeks. This reproductive cycle is relatively short, and represents a more protracted and later breeding season than has been inferred for the species in Queensland. A combination of infrequent moulting and small moult increments indicated an exceptionally slow growth rate; large animals could feasibly be 40 - 50 years old. Implications for the conservation and management of E. sulcatus are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aims: Autoimmune {{pancreatitis}} (AIP) is fre-quently {{associated with}} diabetes mellitus (DM). This study evaluated {{the effect of}} steroid therapy on the course of DM in AIP. Methods: Glucose tolerance was examined in 69 pa-tients with AIP. DM onset was classified as either a simulta-neous onset with AIP or an exacerbation of pre-existing DM. Based on {{the changes in the}} HbA 1 c levels and insulin dose, the responses of DM to steroids were classified as improved, no change, or worsened. Results: Thirty (46 %) patients were diagnosed as having DM (simultaneous onset, n= 17; pre-existing, n= 13). Three months after starting the steroid treatment, the DM improved in 13 (54 %) of 24 DM patients. The DM improved in 55 %, had no change in 36 %, and wors-ened in 9 % of the 11 simultaneous onset DM patients, and it improved in 54 %, had no change in 31 %, and worsened in 15 % of the 13 pre-existing DM patients. At approximately 3 years after starting the steroid treatment, the DM improved in 10 (63 %) of 16 patients. The pancreatic exocrine function improved in parallel with the changes in the DM in seven patients. Conclusions: Because approximately 60 % of DM associated with AIP is responsive to steroids in the short- and <b>long-terms,</b> <b>marked</b> DM associated with AIP appears to be an indication for steroid therapy.
