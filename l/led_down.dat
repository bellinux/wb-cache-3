5|$|A 12th century {{stairway}} {{was discovered}} that <b>led</b> <b>down</b> to a lower chapel from the 11th century, in excellent condition, whose existence was completely unknown before 1958. Various other traces of the early buildings have been found.|$|E
5|$|Upon opening, {{the house}} {{featured}} two dining rooms with student rooms arranged along lengthy hallways radiating {{from the center}} of the structure. The nine tower floors were only accessible via the ground level, from the dorm's primary entrance hall. An exterior fire escape <b>led</b> <b>down</b> the back of Jewett's tower but was replaced with an interior stairwell during the 2003 renovation.|$|E
5|$|In 1818 Hope-Weir's {{grandson}} James Hope-Vere (1785–1843) asked Thomas Brown {{to provide}} designs for an attic extension, although this was never carried out. Ten years later, William Burn was commissioned {{to design a}} new north wing, incorporating a dining room, with new kitchens below and bedrooms above. The front of this extension was topped by a pediment matching Bruce's original, complete with pineapples, although this too was removed in the 1950s. The rear is bowed, with a curved stair <b>led</b> <b>down</b> to the garden at the rear. Plans for a matching wing to the south were never carried out. Burn also remodelled the interior, creating a large drawing room from the rooms of the south apartment.|$|E

5|$|On {{the east}} side of the Inner Ward is another barbican, {{enclosing}} the castle garden. This was overlooked by the royal apartments, and changed in style over the years: in the early 14th century there was a lawn, in the late 14th century vines, in the 16th century crab-apple trees and a lawn and in the 17th century formal ornamental flowers. A postern gate originally <b>led</b> <b>down</b> to the river where a small dock was built, allowing key visitors to enter the castle in private and for the fortress to be resupplied by boat, although this gate is now concealed by the later bridges built on the site.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{subsequently}} given by Henry II to Thomas Becket {{when he became}} chancellor in 1155. Becket extended the castle to accommodate his large household, but fell from favour in 1164 and the castle was confiscated by the king. Henry II liked Berkhamsted and subsequently used it himself extensively. By the mid-12th century, the castle had been rebuilt in stone, probably by Becket, with a shell keep and an outer stone wall; the bailey was divided in two by a wall to form an inner and an outer bailey. A gatehouse <b>led</b> <b>down</b> into the town, meeting with Castle Street. Henry II also officially recognised the surrounding settlement of Berkhamsted as a town in 1156.|$|E
5|$|Conwy Castle hugs a rocky coastal {{ridge of}} grey {{sandstone}} and limestone, {{and much of}} the stone from the castle is largely taken from the ridge itself, probably when the site was first cleared. The castle has a rectangular plan and is divided into an inner and outer ward, with four large towers on each side. The main entrance to the castle is through the western barbican, an exterior defence in front of the main gate. The barbican features the earliest surviving stone machicolations in Britain. A postern gate originally <b>led</b> <b>down</b> to the river where a small dock was built, allowing key visitors to enter the castle in private and for the fortress to be resupplied by boat. Conwy's outer ward was originally crowded with administrative and service buildings. The inner ward was separated from the outer by a wall, a drawbridge and a gate, protected by a ditch cut into the rock. Inside, it contained the chambers for the royal household, their immediate staff and service facilities. On {{the east side of the}} inner ward is another barbican, enclosing the castle garden.|$|E

The {{following day}} the same events happened; with both Shu officers retreating quickly. Again, Zhurong did not chase them, however, Wei Yan returned and hurled abuse at her. Enraged, she chased him, only to be <b>led</b> <b>down</b> a narrow valley where a trap lay waiting; entrapped in nets with her horse tripped by rope, Zhurong was ensnared.|$|E
25|$|I was {{initiated}} into a college secret society—a {{couple of hours}} of grotesque and good-humored rodomontade and horseplay, in which I cooperated as {{in a kind of}} pleasant nightmare, confident, even when branded with a red-hot iron or doused head-over heels in boiling oil, that it would come out all right. The neophyte is effectively blindfolded during the proceedings, and at last, still sightless, I was <b>led</b> <b>down</b> flights of steps into a silent crypt, and helped into a coffin, where I was to stay until the Resurrection...Thus it was that just as my father passed from this earth, I was lying in a coffin during my initiation into Delta Kappa Epsilon.|$|E

25|$|Kant {{himself did}} not see himself as a relativist, and was aiming to give {{knowledge}} a more solid basis, but as Richard J. Bernstein remarks, reviewing this same critique of Gadamer:Once we begin to question {{whether there is a}} common faculty of taste (a sensus communis), we are easily <b>led</b> <b>down</b> the path to relativism. And this is what did happen after Kant - so much so that today it is extraordinarily difficult to retrieve any idea of taste or aesthetic judgment that is more than the expression of personal preferences. Ironically (given Kant's intentions), the same tendency has worked itself out with a vengeance with regards to all judgments of value, including moral judgments.|$|E
25|$|The second {{building}} {{phase in}} 25 BCE included {{an addition to}} the Western Palace, a large storage complex for food, and the Northern Palace. The Northern Palace is one of Herod's more lavish palace-fortresses, and {{was built on the}} hilltop {{on the north side of}} Masada and continues two levels down, over the end of the cliffs. The upper terrace of the Northern Palace included living quarters for the king and a semicircular portico to provide a view of the area. A stairway on the west side <b>led</b> <b>down</b> to the middle terrace that was a decorative circular reception hall. The lower terrace was also for receptions and banquets. It was enclosed on all four sides with porticos and included a Roman bathhouse.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Bendix's 7th New York Volunteer Infantry {{had opened}} fire on Colonel Frederick Townsend's 3rd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, who were coming up the narrow road from the {{direction}} of Hampton to the south. The 3rd New York Infantry was being <b>led</b> <b>down</b> the road by General Peirce and his staff on horseback without an advance guard. Bendix knew that no cavalry was with the Union force and mistook the 3rd New York for a Confederate cavalry regiment. More importantly, the 3rd New York Infantry wore gray uniforms, with white bands on their arms such as had been seen previously on the hats, at least, of Confederates. Bendix, who had not been given the watchword or the instructions on armbands, thought the Confederates were behind his regiment as well as in front and ordered his men to fire upon Townsend's men.|$|E
40|$|Solid state {{lighting}} (SSL), specifically {{light-emitting diodes}} (LED), has been advancing {{at a rapid}} pace, and there are presently multiple products available that serve as direct replacements for traditional luminaires. In this demonstration, conventional recessed lights {{in a conference room}} were used to compare conventional incandescent A-lamps, incandescent reflector R-lamps, dimming compact fluorescent lamps (CFL), to an LED replacement product. The primary focus during the study was on light delivered to the task plane as provided by the power required by the lighting system. Vertical illuminance, dimming range, and color shift are also important indicators of lighting quality and are discussed in the report. The results clearly showed that LEDs, with dimming-capable drivers, are much more efficient than incandescent and CFLs. Further, LEDs provide much smoother and consistent dimming than dimmable CFLs. On the potential negative side, {{it is important that the}} dimming switch be identified as compatible with the LED driver. A wide variety of dimmer switches are capable of dimming <b>LEDs</b> <b>down</b> to 15 % of full light output, while select others can be capable of dimming <b>LEDs</b> <b>down</b> to 5 %. In addition, LEDs can be intensive light sources, which can result in uncomfortable glare in some applications and to some occupants. Higher ceiling (9 -foot or greater) or non-specular reflectors can act to alleviate the potential for glare...|$|R

25|$|Servia had public {{rooms of}} a scale and luxury greater than {{previously}} known. Of the three decks, {{the upper deck}} consisted of deck-houses that included a first-class smoking room, and a luxuriously fitted ladies drawing room and a music room. The entrance and grand staircase was the largest that had ever appeared on a liner, and was panelled in polished maple and ash. It <b>led</b> <b>down</b> to the a landing on the main deck which featured a library. Twenty-four first-class state-rooms were situated aft of this landing, while the first-class dining salon was situated forward. The dining salon could sit 220 of Servia's 480 first-class passengers on five long tables, and was richly decorated with carved panels and carpets. In the centre was an open well that rose 17ft to a skylight. Forward of the dining salon were a further 58 staterooms, followed by crew accommodation areas.|$|E
25|$|The Chargers went to Baltimore for {{the first}} time since 2000. The Chargers <b>led</b> <b>down</b> the field first with a 31-yard {{touchdown}} pass to WR Malcom Floyd. However, this was followed two drives later by an interception by OLB Bart Scott (who was named September's Defensive Player of the Month recently before the game), which led to a 5-yard touchdown pass from QB Steve McNair to TE Daniel Wilcox. In the second quarter, 2 Chargers field goals from kicker Nate Kaeding put San Diego in the lead at the half. In the third quarter, the Ravens' defense held the Chargers to no points. They were assisted by a loud stadium, which led to a fourth quarter intentional safety by Chargers punter Mike Scifres. The Ravens took the ball at the 40-yard line with 3:12 to go. After Derrick Mason dropped a possible touchdown pass early in the drive, a 10-yard pass to TE Todd Heap won the game with 30 seconds to play. On the touchdown catch, Heap broke a tackle from Shawne Merriman. With the win, the Ravens were 4–0 {{for the first}} time in their 11-year history. However, Guard Edwin Mulitalo was injured for the entire season with a triceps injury.|$|E
500|$|After an {{abortive}} Turkish {{attack in}} early May, {{from the middle}} of the month the New Zealanders observed their opponents improving their defensive positions. One position in particular was started overnight on 26/27 May, at the foot of the ridge that <b>led</b> <b>down</b> to No.2 Post and only [...] from it. It gave the New Zealanders cause for concern, and therefore it was decided that the position must be captured and denied to the Turks.|$|E
