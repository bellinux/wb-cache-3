50|$|Conventional wisdom used {{to assert}} that a <b>LIBID</b> rate could be {{calculated}} by subtracting a fixed amount (often given as ⅛th of 1%) from the prevailing BBA LIBOR rate, however {{this is no longer}} the case as bid/offer spreads have tightened in recent years. Additionally, it cannot be the case that the LIBOR / <b>LIBID</b> spread is always ⅛th of 1% for all maturities and all currencies all the time.|$|E
5000|$|The London Interbank Bid Rate (<b>LIBID)</b> is a bid rate; {{the rate}} bid by banks on Eurocurrency {{deposits}} (i.e., {{the rate at}} which a bank is willing to borrow from other banks). It is the [...] "other end" [...] of the LIBOR (an offered, hence [...] "ask" [...] rate, {{the rate at which}} a bank will lend). Whilst the British Bankers' Association set LIBOR rates, there is no correspondent official <b>LIBID</b> fixing.|$|E

Three different concentrations of amlodipine (0. 01, 0. 02 and 0. 03 mg/kg body weight) was administered orally to three different groups (B, C, and D) of experimental male wistar albino rats (n = 8) for six weeks. Group A rats were fed normal diet without amlodipine (n = 8) served as the control. The administration of amlodipine significantly reduced testosterone level in the following order, group A (0. 22 &plusmn; 0. 01) &gt; B (0. 18 &plusmn; 0. 01) &gt; C (0. 14 &plusmn; 0. 01) &gt; D (0. 10 &plusmn; 0. 01). The reduction in testosterone levels corresponded {{with an increase in}} the concentration of amlodipine administered to male wistar albino rats. The observation in this study reveals that long-term treatment of male Wistar rats with calcium-channel blocker and antihypertensive (amlodipine) produces a significant reduction in the level of testosterone a hormone associated with decreased ability of men to enjoy sex and to develop good quality erections. There is the need for a large scale study to investigate the potential effect of long-term antihypertensive therapy with amlodipine on sexual dysfunction in men.

He is talking to a young woman seen only partially from the back. The girl is richly dressed, with a satin <b>libade</b> over her jelek, a long necklace of coins, earrings and a filigree belt. Her hair is dressed to the back – no scarf is visible. Her blouse has a collar in the urban fashion of the 1930 s. She is leaning towards the man with her right {{hand on his shoulder}} and half covering her mouth, and is smiling directly into the camera. The girl is probably the man’s daughter. She might be a bride. The costumes are from the surroundings of Sarajevo. Analogue photographic process, negative-positive (Agfa Isopan 17 DIN).

The abilities were related with the potency of Bilimbi {{and can be used}} to solve the hypersexual’s problems. Objective : The study was performed to proved the effect of Bilimbi’s extract on the free testosterone rate and libido in male wistar rat. Methods : This research’s type is pure experimental which the source groups are given by bilimbi’s extract and use device of experimental Randomized Post Test Only Control Group Design. This Research use 30 of male wistar rats are 5 months old and the weight is 250 - 350 grams. These 30 of male wistar rats were divided into 3 groups : Group I : controls group, given by 1, 5 ml of aquadest and standard food Group II : given by bilimbi’s extract 20 gr/kgBW + aquadest to 1, 5 ml and standard food Group III : given by bilimbi’s extract 40 gr/kgBW + aquadest to 1, 5 ml and standard food The free testosterone rate is got from blood which is taken away by rat after 10 treatment days, then conducted by inspection with ELFA method. The data is statistically analyzed by test of Anova to expect the difference of each group. The data of libido is got from the amount introduction and climbing of male rat to female rat is 3 - 4 months old, and then calculated by the area under the curve of data and continued by Kruskall Wallis test to expect the differences of libido of each group. Result : The result of examination, the free testosterone rate is shown the difference meaning among group of I and II (p= 0, 040) and among group of I and III (p= 0, 002). The result of examination of libido is shown the difference meaning among group of I and II (z= 3, 6433), among group of I and III (z= 6, 2084), and among group of II dan III (z= 2, 5651). Conclutions : The bilimbi’s extract can reduce the free testosterone rate and libido in male wistar rat. Keyword : the bilimbi’s extract, free testosterone rate, <b>libid...</b>|$|E
