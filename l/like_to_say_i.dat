2500|$|Since the 2008 presidential {{election}} Griffin has made frequent jokes about Republican vice-presidential contender Sarah Palin and family. Griffin parodied Palin in Glee, {{wearing a red}} power-suit and wide-rimmed glasses, posing as a judge at the regionals singing competition. Griffin also poked fun at Christine O'Donnell in the show by stating, [...] "Before we start, I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> am not a witch." ...|$|E
2500|$|DiFranco {{issued an}} apology on January 2, 2014 {{following}} continued criticism. [...] In it, she wrote [...] "..i would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>i</b> am sincerely sorry. {{it is obvious}} to me now that you were right - all those who said we can't in good conscience go to that place and support it or look past for one moment what it deeply represents. i needed a wake up call and you gave it to me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That is very well; {{but it is}} {{not quite}} what I should have <b>liked</b> you <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> should have <b>liked</b> you <b>to</b> say: 'If my father doesn't think well of you, what does it matter?'" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{got up in}} some irritation. [...] "Can I see him, at any rate?" [...] I asked. [...] "I am a journalist, {{and have}} no earthly motives except curiosity and {{personal}} vanity. <b>I</b> should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that <b>I</b> had shaken hands with the Superman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She'll take it very kindly, your reverence. But {{while you}} are here, sir, there's just a word I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> didn't happen to catch Mr. Henry when he was here the other day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> {{regard the}} fact of falling in love, at {{whatever}} age, as in itself an act of selection. But my being as I am {{at this time of}} day would contradict me too much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{was nothing}} secret about them--to him. Aunt Lora {{brought me to}} the studio in the first place, and she kept on {{bringing}} me. I don't suppose it ever occurred to Kirk to wonder who I was and who my father might be. He has been perfectly straight. If you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> have been underhanded, I admit it. I have. More so than you imagine. I just wanted him, and I didn't care for anything except that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Though I 'm a great ass, all the same, eh? Well, call me {{what you}} will, {{so long as you}} turn out this sort of thing! I don't suppose it makes any {{particular}} difference, but <b>I</b> should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> now <b>I</b> believe in you." ...|$|R
60|$|Now I ask you, is {{this to be}} borne? Here I sit, and {{he talks}} half-impudently and patronisingly about me. And here I sit, and he is glegging {{at me as if}} he saw signs of an aureole under my grey hat. All in ten minutes. And just because, instead of la Germania I turn out to be l'Inghilterra. I might as well be a place on a map, or a piece of goods with a trade-mark. So little {{perception}} of the actual me! so much going by labels! I now could have kicked him harder. <b>I</b> would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> was ten times German, to see the fool change his smirk again.|$|R

6000|$|... 'I do, indeed,' {{replied the}} junior. Mr. Weller seized his son's hand, clasped it, {{and let it}} fall. There was an {{expression}} on his countenance in doing so--not of dismay or apprehension, but partaking more of the sweet and gentle character of hope. A gleam of resignation, and even of cheerfulness, passed over his face too, as he slowly said, 'I ain't quite certain, Sammy; I wouldn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> wos altogether positive, in case of any subsekent disappointment, but I rayther think, my boy, I rayther think, that the shepherd's got the liver complaint!' ...|$|E
6000|$|His eye {{fell on his}} wet boots. The {{whole thing}} was scaring, and jumping up, he began to throw his clothes into his trunks. It was twelve o'clock before he went down, and found his brother and Traquair still at the table {{arranging}} an itinerary; he surprised them by saying that he too was coming; and without further explanation set to work to eat. James had heard that there were salt-mines in the neighbourhood--his proposal was to start, and halt {{an hour or so}} on the road for their inspection; he said: [...] "Everybody'll ask you if you've seen the salt-mines: I shouldn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> hadn't seen the salt-mines. What's the good, they'd say, of your going there if you haven't seen the salt-mines?" [...] He wondered, too, if they need fee the second waiter--an idle chap! ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'I was {{beginning}} to get anxious myself,' he said, 'but did not quite <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> so. <b>I</b> have been in over half an hour, hoping every moment that you would come in, and that perhaps you could give me some reassuring news. I thought that perhaps you had met Mr. Schwarz, and were coming back together.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's not that--only {{they don't}} <b>like</b> me <b>to.</b> They <b>say</b> <b>I</b> care more {{for you than}} for them. And you understand, don't you? You know it's only friendship." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well,' he said, {{becoming}} serious, 'to {{tell the}} truth, I {{have always felt}} myself unfit for this business, though I've never <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> so. <b>I</b> seem <b>to</b> want more room for sprawling; a more open space to strike out in than here among friends and neighbours.

6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] Tom said warmly; [...] "I {{will follow}} your advice, {{which will be}} easy enough. Beyond a glass of beer with my dinner and a tot of grog, perhaps once in three months when I have gone on board a ship, and did not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> no, <b>I</b> have never touched it, and have no wish to do so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do her justice. I do {{her full}} justice," [...] she went on, with soft earnestness. [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be able <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it. She 's full of {{intelligence}} and courage and devotion.

6000|$|... "There is one thing, Andrew," [...] he said, [...] "which <b>I</b> should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you. <b>I</b> {{want you}} to {{remember}} the night in your garden, when {{you asked me to}} come to Paris for you." ...|$|R

6000|$|Then Lizzie, in {{a frightened}} whisper, {{with her eyes}} often turned on the floor, told the whole story.
