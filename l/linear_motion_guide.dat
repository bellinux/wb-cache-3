Based on measurement data study of prediction of <b>linear</b> <b>motion</b> <b>guide</b> rigidity could be conducted to serve as the basis for quality improvement and effective selection. Grey modeling is employed for rigidity prediction to provide references for linear motion guides manufacturers and users. The prediction model established through grey linear differential equation is based on the continuous system, which is superior to that established by grey linear differential equation. The prediction results also show the error of grey linear differential modeling is less significant than that of grey linear difference modeling.

40|$|In this research, {{experimental}} {{studies have been}} performed on the hydrodynamic interaction between a spherical particle and a plane wall by measuring the force between the particle and wall. To approach {{the system as a}} resistance problem, a servo-driving system was set-up by assembling a microstepping motor, a ball screw and a <b>linear</b> <b>motion</b> <b>guide</b> for the particle motion. Glycerin and dilute solution of polyacrylamide in glycerin were used as Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, respectively. The polymer solution behaves like a Boger fluid when the concentration is 1, 000 ppm or less. The experimental results were compared with the asymptotic solution of Stokes equation. The result shows that fluid inertia {{plays an important role in}} the particle-wall interaction in Newtonian fluid. This implies that the motion of two particles in suspension is not reversible even in Newtonian fluid. In non-Newtonian fluid, normal stress difference and viscoelasticity play important roles as expected. In the dilute solution weak shear thinning and the migration of polymer molecules in the inhomogeneous flow field also affect the physics of the problem...|$|E
40|$|In {{microelectronics}} manufacturing, macro–micro actuation stages {{are typically}} applied {{to obtain a}} high-precision positioning at a high acceleration. Macro–micro actuation stage comprises a voice coil motor that achieves a high-acceleration motion and a piezoelectric stack actuator which realizes nano-positioning motion. However, high acceleration and nano-positioning are a pair of interacted contradictions. Especially, vibration generated from the high-acceleration motion is the dominating obstacle for enhancement of the nano-positioning implementation. The concentration of the article is a design of a linear macro–micro actuation stage considering vibration isolation. In particular, a floating stator system is proposed to suppress the stage’s vibration and further guarantee a higher precision positioning. Additionally, a flexure hinge mechanism connected to the voice coil motor serially is proposed to achieve a <b>linear</b> <b>motion</b> <b>guide</b> and preload to the piezoelectric stack actuator.

40|$|Linear flow {{splitting}} is {{a massive}} forming process that allows bifurcated profiles to be formed out of sheet metal in integral style. Linear flow split components have specific technology-induced properties (e. g. ultra fine grained microstructures at {{the surface of the}} flanges and the splitting ground). That is why they are predestined to beused in linear guides. Additionally linear flow split components enable to integrate supplemental functions (e. g. clamping) in linear guides. These functions need to be developed and implemented by emphasizing the advantages of the new technology. Based on a property-focused examination, different design concepts of <b>linear</b> <b>motion</b> <b>guides</b> of <b>linear</b> flow split components are worked out.

Also {{the stage for}} the IRIS Imager is required to survive for 10 years without maintenance. To achieve these requirements, we decided prototyping of a two axis stage with 80 mm clear aperture. The prototype was designed as a double-deck stage, upper rotary stage and lower linear stage. Most of components are selected to take advantage of heritage from existing astronomical instruments. In contrast, mechanical components with lubricants such as bearings, <b>linear</b> <b>motion</b> <b>guides</b> and ball screws were modified to survive cryogenic environment.

40|$|<b>Linear</b> <b>motion</b> (LM) ball <b>guides</b> {{have good}} {{accuracy}} and high efficiency. They are widely applied for precision machinery such as machine tools, semiconductor fabrication machines and robots. However, friction force incurs heat between the balls and grooves. Thermal expansion {{due to the}} heat deteriorates stiffness and accuracy of the LM ball guides. For accurate estimation of stiffness and accuracy during the <b>linear</b> <b>motion,</b> friction models of LM ball guides are required. To formulate accurate frictional models of LM ball guides according to load and preload conditions, rolling and viscous frictional analyses have been performed in this paper. Contact loads between balls and grooves are derived from Hertzian contact analysis. Contact angle variation is incorporated for the precision modeling. Viscous friction model is formulated from the shear stress of lubricant and the contact area between balls and grooves. Experiments confirm validity of the developed friction model for various external load and feedrate conditions...|$|R

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} for the steric interaction between a plasma membrane protein and the membrane cytoskeleton {{in the human}} erythrocyte. The cytoskeleton is treated as a network of polymer chains attached to a flat bilayer, and the membrane protein is a hemisphere of effective radius R(e) with center on the bilayer edge. The simulation is used to investigate the barrier-free path L for <b>linear</b> <b>guided</b> <b>motion</b> of a protein in the bilayer plane. It is shown that the barrier-free paths of small proteins {{can be used to}} extract the effective in-plane diameter of cytoskeletal components. For example, the in-plane diameter of an ankyrin attachment site is found to be approximately 12 nm in the simulation, or twice the computational spectrin diameter. The barrier-free paths of large proteins (R(e) > 23 nm) vanish when the proteins are corralled by the cytoskeleton. For intermediate size proteins, L decreases approximately as L is directly proportional to S- 1. 4 where S is proportional to the sum of the protein and cytoskeleton chain radii...|$|R
