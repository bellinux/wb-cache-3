5000|$|<b>Lee</b> <b>helm</b> is the {{tendency}} of a sailboat {{to turn away from}} the wind while under sail.

50|$|<b>Lee</b> <b>helm</b> is {{considered}} dangerous in a sailboat. While sailing, if left {{to its own}} devices a boat with <b>lee</b> <b>helm</b> will bear (turn) away from the wind, accelerate, and perform an accidental or uncontrolled gybe, perhaps repeatedly. In an uncontrolled gybe {{the force of the}} wind moves the sails and boom {{from one side of the}} boat to the other. In a strong wind this movement will by very fast and forceful and can damage the boat, the sails, injure the crew, and even cause the boat to Broach (lie over on its side).|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally {{there are}} two {{stations}} {{on the bridge of}} a sea going ship for controlling the vessel's maneuvers: the Helm, which uses a wheel (or touchscreen equivalent) to send signals to control the position of the rudder or rudders, and the <b>Lee</b> <b>Helm,</b> which traditionally inputs speed commands by operating an engine order telegraph that sends engine commands to the engineering personnel below decks. On modern US Navy surface vessels that use gas turbine or diesel propulsion, the <b>lee</b> <b>helm</b> actually directly controls the ship's speed via throttle control (either a manual throttle lever or a touch screen on some ships). The bridge throttle control directly manipulates propeller pitch and/or engine RPMs when the bridge station is in control, or switches to a traditional order telegraph when the bridge station relinquishes control or if the control system fails. The <b>lee</b> <b>helm</b> on vessels with nuclear propulsion (carriers and submarines) and conventional steam propulsion (amphibious assault ships prior to LHD-8) still uses a telegraph system. One possible origin for the <b>Lee</b> <b>Helm</b> designation for the Engine Order Telegraph is that large sailing ships had a helmsman at the wheel, plus an auxiliary helmsman, positioned on the leeward side of the helm - hence the term [...] "Lee Helm" [...] - to assist the helmsman in controlling the wheel while coming about or when the vessel is laboring in high winds or an extreme sea state.|$|E

5000|$|Weather helm is the {{tendency}} of sailing vessels to turn towards the source of wind, creating an unbalanced helm that requires pulling the tiller to windward (i.e. 'to weather') in order to counteract the effect. Weather helm {{is the opposite of}} <b>lee</b> <b>helm.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{root cause}} of <b>lee</b> <b>helm</b> is when the center of {{pressure}} exerted by the wind on the sails falls too far forward {{of the center of}} resistance of the hull—the natural point at which the hull tries to pivot. This tends to push the bow of the boat away from the wind. This can be due to a poor design, for example with the mast too far forward.|$|E
50|$|The {{increasingly}} asymmetric underwater {{shape of}} the hull matching the increasing angle of heel may generate an increasing directional turning force into the wind. The sails' centre of effort will also increase this turning effect or force on the vessel's motion due to increasing lever effect with increased heeling which shows itself as increased human effort required to steer a straight course. Increased heeling reduces exposed sail area relative to the wind direction, so leading to an equilibrium state. As more heeling force causes more heel, weather helm may be experienced. This condition has a braking effect on the vessel but has the safety effect in that an excessively hard pressed boat will try and turn into the wind, therefore, reducing the forces on the sail. Small amounts (≤5 degrees) of weather helm are generally considered desirable because of the consequent aerofoil lift effect from the rudder. This aerofoil lift produces helpful motion to windward & the corollary {{of the reason why}} <b>lee</b> <b>helm</b> is dangerous. <b>Lee</b> <b>helm,</b> the opposite of weather helm, is generally considered to be dangerous because the vessel turns away from the wind when the helm is released, thus increasing forces on the sail {{at a time when the}} helmsperson is not in control.|$|E
