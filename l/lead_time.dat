40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to provide a}} deeper {{understanding}} of how e-commerce companies within the fashion industry are working with <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> and illustrate and analyse differences and similarities between companies. Research question - In which ways are e-commerce companies within the fashion industry working with short <b>lead</b> <b>times?</b> Methodology This thesis is based on a qualitative research method in order to achieve a greater understanding of the chosen topic, of how the chosen companies are operating and to provide room to our own interpretations and reflections. Interviews through telephone were used to gather the empirical data from six different e-commerce companies within the fashion industry. Conclusions After completing the theoretical and empirical analysis it can be concluded that <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> are considered essential for all of the participating companies but there is a difference in which way they look at, and how they work with <b>lead</b> <b>times.</b> Some companies stressed that short <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> are an important aspect of competition and claimed that this is something they are constantly working with. For others the balance and matching of supply and demand was the most important factor rather than to achieve short <b>lead</b> <b>times.</b> These differences can be due to different groups of customers with different sensitivity to trends, whether e-commerce is a primary or secondary sales channel as well as the companies ability and willingness to influence their <b>lead</b> <b>times.</b> The key elements in working with <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> is making preparations for activities, to have a good relationship with the suppliers, to conduct analysis of the supply chain processes and to keep a certain stock level in the distribution...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, lot sizing {{decisions}} in inventory management trade-off {{the cost of}} placing orders against the cost of holding inventory. However, when these lot sizes are to be produced in a finite capacity production/inventory system, the lot size has an important impact on the <b>lead</b> <b>times,</b> which in turn determine inventory levels (and costs). In this paper we study the lot sizing decision in a production/inventory setting, where <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> are determined by a queueing model that is linked endogenously to the orders placed by the inventory model. Assuming a continuous review (s,S) inventory policy, we develop a procedure to obtain the distribution of <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> {{and the distribution of}} inventory levels, when <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> are endogenously determined by the inventory model. This procedure allows to determine the optimal inventory parameters within the class of (s,S) policies that minimize the expected ordering and inventory related costs over time. We numerically show that ignoring the endogeneity of <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> may <b>lead</b> to inappropriate lot sizing decisions and significantly higher costs. This cost discrepancy is very outspoken if the lot size based on the economic order quantity deviates significantly from desirable production lot sizes. In these cases, the endogenous treatment of <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> is of particular importance. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|URL] audienceEfficient {{replenishment}} {{planning is}} a very important problem in Supply chain management. A poor inventory control policy leads to overstocking or stockout situations. In the former, the generated inventories are expensive and in the later there are shortages and penalties due to unsatisfied customer demands. Material Requirements Planning (MRP) is a commonly accepted approach for replenishment planning in major companies (AxsÃ¤ter, 2006). The MRP software tools are accepted readily, the majority of industrial decision makers are familiar with them through all the existing production control system software. MRP software has a well developed information system and has been proven over time. However, MRP is based on the supposition that the demand and <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> are known. This premise of deterministic environment seems somewhat off base since most production occurs stochastically. Component and semi-finished product <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> and finished product demands are rarely forecasted reliably. This is because there are some random factors such as machine breakdowns, transport delays, customer demand variations, etc. Therefore, in real life, the deterministic assumptions embedded in MRP are often too limited. Fortunately, the MRP approach can be adapted for replenishment planning under uncertainties by searching optimal values for its parameters. This problem is called MRP parameterization under uncertainties. The planned <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> are parameters of MRP. For the case of random <b>lead</b> <b>times,</b> the planned <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> are calculated as the sum of the forecasted and safety <b>lead</b> <b>times.</b> These safety times are obtained as a trade-off between overstocking and stockout while minimizing the total cost. The search for optimal values of safety <b>lead</b> <b>times,</b> and, consequently, for planned <b>lead</b> <b>times,</b> is a crucial and challenging issue in Supply chain management with MRP approach...|$|R
