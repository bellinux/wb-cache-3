The growth rate approaches some tenth parts of the lower hybrid frequency if the electron drift velocity in the field of the helicon exceeds the ion sound velocity by some times.

40|$|Magnetorotational Instability (MRI), the {{instability}} causing turbulent transport in accretion disks, is {{studied in the}} kinetic regime. Radiatively Inefficient Accretion Flows (RIAFs), like the one around the supermassive black hole {{in the center of}} our Galaxy, are believed to be collisionless. Kinetic MHD formalism, based on the moments of the Vlasov equation, is used for linear analysis and nonlinear simulations. ZEUS MHD code is modified to include key kinetic MHD terms: anisotropic pressure tensor and anisotropic thermal conduction. Simulations use the local shearing box approximation. Pressure anisotropy is created, because of the adiabatic invariance (μ=p_/B), as magnetic field is amplified by the MRI. <b>Larmor</b> <b>radius</b> scale <b>instabilities</b> [...] mirror, ion-cyclotron, and firehose [...] are excited at large pressure anisotropy. Pressure isotropization due to pitch angle scattering by these instabilities is included as a subgrid model. A key result of the kinetic MHD simulations is that the anisotropic (viscous) stress can be as large as the Maxwell stress. A new numerical method to simulate anisotropic thermal conduction with large temperature gradients is suggested. Simple tests show that the centered differencing of anisotropic thermal conduction can result in heat flowing from lower to higher temperatures, giving rise to negative temperatures. Limiting of transverse temperature gradients does not accentuate temperature extrema. Comment: PhD thesis, Princeton University, September 200...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} finite <b>Larmor</b> <b>radius</b> on the {{transport}} of passive charged test particles moving in turbulent electrostatic fields is investigated. The turbulent field is governed by a flexible model which is able to produce turbulence where zonal flows are damped or free to self-generate. A subtle interplay between trapping in small scale vortices and entrainment in larger scale zonal flows determines the rate, character and <b>Larmor</b> <b>radius</b> dependence of the test particle transport. When zonal flows are damped, the transport is classically diffusive, with Gaussian statistics, {{and the rate of}} transport decreases with increasing <b>Larmor</b> <b>radius.</b> Once the <b>Larmor</b> <b>radius</b> is larger than the typical radius of the turbulent vortices, the rate of transport remains roughly constant. When zonal flows are allowed non-Gaussian statistics are observed. Radial transport (across the zones) is subdiffusive and decreases with the <b>Larmor</b> <b>radius</b> at a slower rate.
