The three buildings on the site were a three-story powerhouse (measuring about sixty feet/18 m square), which contained the machinery to operate the lock, and with two identical -story residences for the <b>lock</b> <b>master</b> and for the crew that worked at the site.

5000|$|Masters made a {{claim that}} {{his version of the}} full nelson hold, which he dubbed the <b>Master</b> <b>Lock,</b> was unbreakable. <b>Masters</b> began a series of {{contests}} he would call [...] "Master Lock Challenges" [...] where Masters would put an opponent in the <b>Master</b> <b>Lock</b> and the opponent would try to break free before Masters made him submit or pass out. Masters would go on to log more full nelson submission victories than any wrestler in WWE history, breaking the record previously held by Kurt Angle. Originally he would call out plants from the crowd, placing a $1,000 prize of his own money to be paid to anyone who could break free from the <b>Master</b> <b>Lock.</b> At Backlash, he defeated Melissa Coates in a <b>Master</b> <b>Lock</b> Challenge. He engaged in feuds with lower-card wrestlers, Val Venis and Sgt. Slaughter, who both failed to break the <b>Master</b> <b>Lock.</b> Using villainous tactics, he often attacked the wrestlers beforehand and frequently cheated (for example using a low-blow to escape Sgt. Slaughter's cobra clutch). Masters increased the offered reward each week up to $20,000 and sometimes threw in a bonus. After defeating the 400-pound Rosey on July 18, Masters defiantly stated [...] "it doesn't matter how big they are!", prompting The Big Show to accept a <b>Master</b> <b>Lock</b> Challenge. In accordance with his villainous persona, Masters fled, refusing a match with the Big Show.|$|R

This paper presents a performance study of three dierent implementation strategies for a DLM consider-ing both {{the layout of}} the lock database (centralised or distributed) and the strategy used to assign lock masters (static or dynamic). For each implementation strategy, we develop accurate analytical models of communication cost, resource utilisation and lock request response time. The models highlight bottlenecks in the system and show clearly for what mixes of incoming lock request types it is best to use static or dy-namic <b>lock</b> <b>master</b> positioning. The analytical formulae are validated against a detailed event-driven simulation which uses realistic hardware parameters. This validation re-veals a good agreement between analytical and simulation results, particularly with respect to communication cost, node and CPU utilisation, system capacity and the response time trend. ...|$|E

40|$|The present thesis {{introduces}} the lock scheduling problem and promising decompositions into sub problems. Several combinatorial optimization {{methods have been}} developed for the lock scheduling problem. Single and parallel chamber locks and lock operations in both an inland and mixed-traffic setting are considered, and a mathematical model precisely describing the problem is presented. Three interrelated sub problems can be discerned: ship placement, chamber assignment and lockage operation scheduling. These are closely related to the two dimensional bin packing problem, the assignment problem and the (parallel) machine scheduling problem respectively. After an in-depth analysis the ship placement sub problem is decomposed by exploiting its sequence constraints, and both an exact and a heuristic approach are developed and tested on a large and diverse test set. A decision support tool for <b>lock</b> <b>masters</b> is presented and evaluated during live-tests at mixed-traffic locks in a major port and on an important waterway. These tests reveal that the introduction of fast and high-quality optimization software in the <b>lock</b> <b>master's</b> tool suite can increase lock efficiency by enabling a faster reaction to last-minute changes, quickly producing good solutions during peak traffic and increasing the lock's planning horizon. The lock scheduling problem is solved through Combinatorial Benders' decomposition by combining the assignment and scheduling problems into a master problem and considering ship placement as a sub problem. Efficient cut separation methods are introduced and tested and the performance of an exact and of a heuristic solution method for the packing sub problem are evaluated. Experiments show that the decomposition method outperforms a monolithic branch-and-bound approach, and that the slow convergence of the master problem is currently the decomposition method's limiting factor. nrpages: 160 status: publishe...|$|R

By this time, the buildings had been abandoned for nearly 45 years, but they still remained in their original places and in virtually original condition—a status unequalled by any comparable site.
