5|$|The ridge {{fell under}} German control in October 1914 during the Race to the Sea as the Franco-British and German forces {{continually}} attempted to outflank {{each other through}} northeastern France. The French Tenth Army attempted to dislodge the Germans from the region during the Second Battle of Artois in May 1915 by attacking their positions at Vimy Ridge and Notre Dame de Lorette. The French 1st Moroccan Division managed to briefly capture {{the height of the}} ridge but was unable to hold it owing to a lack of reinforcements. The French made another attempt during the Third Battle of Artois in September 1915 but only captured the village of Souchez at the western base of the ridge. The Vimy sector calmed following the offensive with both sides taking a largely <b>live</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>live</b> approach. In all, the French suffered approximately 150,000 casualties in their attempts to gain control of Vimy Ridge and surrounding territory.|$|E

25|$|The {{fundamental}} principles of Jainism {{revolve around the}} concept of altruism, not only for humans but for all sentient beings. Jainism preaches the view of Ahimsa â€“ to <b>live</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>live,</b> thereby not harming sentient beings, i.e. uncompromising reverence for all life. It also considers all living things to be equal. The first Tirthankara, Rishabhdev introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings, from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation, giving oneself up for others, non-violence and compassion for all living things.|$|E

When the Xbox was released in 2001, the Live service was not online yet so the dashboard's Live feature was unusable.|$|R
6000|$|First, then, [...] "Little Freddy Scoutbush," [...] as his compeers irreverently termed him, was, {{by common}} consent of her Majesty's Guards, a [...] "good fellow." [...] Whether the St. James' Street {{definition}} of that adjective {{be the perfect}} one or not, we will not stay to inquire; but in the Guards' club-house it meant this: that Scoutbush had not an enemy in the world, because he deserved none; that he lent, and borrowed not; gave, and asked not again; envied not; hustled not; slandered not; never bore malice, never said a cruel word, never played a dirty trick, would hear a fellow's troubles out to the end, and {{if he could not}} counsel, at least would not laugh at them, and at all times and in all places <b>lived</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>live,</b> <b>and</b> was accordingly a general favourite.

He also appeared in a parody of the British quiz show Bob's Full House, called [...] "Slob's Full Tum", where contestants had to eat {{as much as they}} could and whoever got a full tum in the quickest time was the winner. The game show was hosted by [...] "Slob Monkhouse", again a parody of the original host name Bob Monkhouse. These strips were all drawn by Jim Petrie, the Minnie the Minx artist at that time.|$|R
25|$|The (white-owned) <b>Live</b> <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> <b>Live</b> pub was {{targeted}} and pelted with bricks, stones, bottles, and then petrol bombs. Cars were driven {{to block the}} fire exits, {{in an attempt to}} stop the patrons from escaping the flames. Cars in the surrounding roads were ignited, and police were called. Police officers were pelted by groups of Asian males. A night of violence began and riot police were quickly drafted in to the Glodwick area, rife with both Pakistani and Bangladeshi rioters. It is understood that both the Asian and white communities were furious with the recent events in the town. Asians were angry with media coverage and police handling of the various incidents and this may have intensified the riot.|$|E

Could a man be happier than I ought to be, sprung as I am from monopolists of all the sources and {{instruments}} of production--of land on the one side, and of machinery on the other? This very ground on which we are resting was the property of my mother's father. At least the law allowed him {{to use it as}} such. When he was a boy, there was a fairly prosperous race of peasants settled here, tilling the soil, paying him rent for permission to do so, and making enough out of it to satisfy his large wants and their own narrow needs without working themselves to death. But my grandfather was a shrewd man. He perceived that cows and sheep produced more money by their meat and wool than peasants by their husbandry. So he cleared the estate. That is, he drove the peasants from their homes, as my father did afterwards in his Scotch deer forest. Or, as his tombstone has it, he developed the resources of his country. I don't know what became of the peasants; HE didn't know, and, I presume, didn't care. I suppose the old ones went into the workhouse, and the young ones crowded the towns, and worked for men like my father in factories. Their places were taken by cattle, which paid for their food so well that my grandfather, getting my father to take shares in the enterprise, hired laborers on the Manchester terms to cut that canal for him. When it was made, he took toll upon it; and his heirs still take toll, and the sons of the navvies who dug it and of the engineer who designed it pay the toll when they have occasion to travel by it, or to purchase goods which have been conveyed along it. I remember my grandfather well. He was a well-bred man, and a perfect gentleman in his manners; but, on the whole, I think he was wickeder than my father, who, after all, was caught in the wheels of a vicious system, and had either to spoil others or be spoiled by them. But my grandfather--the old rascal!--was in no such dilemma. Master as he was of his bit of merry England, no man could have enslaved him, and he might at least have <b>lived</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>live.</b> My father followed his example in the matter of the deer forest, but that was the climax of his wickedness, whereas it was only the beginning of my grandfather's. Howbeit, whichever bears the palm, there they were, the types after which we all strive." ...|$|R
40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that the Nigerian nation is enmeshed in deep and serious crisis now. The most {{disturbing}} is the problem of insecurity. Every now and then, many innocent Nigerians are being killed by members of the Boko Haram sect, robbed and kidnapped. Most painful is the way and manner these innocent citizens are being killed in their own country. Regrettably, the security agents are not only loosing out but appear hopeless. Empty promises by the government have not alleviated the situation. The country is fast drifting into anarchy, chaos and doom to the detriment of millions of her citizens. This situation has once again raised the question of national ethics (morality). How were we living together before as one society observing our national norms espe-cially as it concerns respect for human life and how are we going to live together in the future? Reactions trailing the Boko Haram saga have opened up our sordid past with different groups jus-tifying the actions of Boko Haram instead of facing the issue at stake; the sanctity of human life. This calls for a paradigm shift from the use of force to a moral approach. The Igbo communal mo-rality is a humanist morality spelling out personal relationship onye biri ibe ya ebiri (<b>live</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> others <b>live).</b> This humanist morality is what we need at this time if we are going to forge ahead as...|$|R

In his 2009 National Day Rally speech Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong characterized racial and religious divides as [...] "the most visceral and dangerous fault line" [...] in Singapore society, and earlier he had said that [...] "we must respect one another's religions, we must not deliberately insult or desecrate what others hold sacred because {{if we want to}} live peacefully together, then we must <b>live</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>live,</b> there must be tolerance, there must be mutual respect".|$|E

Then came The Linwoods, or Sixty Years Since in America, in 1835. In 1836, she commenced writing in a new vein, giving a series of illustrations of common life, called The Poor Rich Man, and the Rich Poor Man.

2500|$|In Jainism, {{although}} ahimsa {{is considered}} its foremost vow, {{the extension of}} this to self-sacrifice at times may be considered equivalent to human sacrifice (or ritual suicide), especially by those who oppose the Jain practice of Sallekhana (fasting to death), whereas Jaina scriptures supposedly (or interpretively) counter that Sallekhana leads to Ahimsa, because their concept of simple living could even become excessive to that end (as it may be impossible to exist more or less selflessly), when lifestyle remains a preclusion {{to the state of}} nirvana, and likewise a notion of transcending the problem (of how to <b>live</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>live),</b> with one's bodily sacrifice being a voluntary spiritual practice; perhaps the courts having ruled back and forth on it as a legal matter suggests that the paradox (or debatability) of Ahimsa versus Sallekhana, which is essentially that of nonviolence amounting to violence, involves determining whether such a death is a physical act of human(e) sacrifice or lack thereof.
