50|$|Soon {{after the}} {{introduction}} of the 1000 model, a second model was added, the Royal 1000D. The only difference was the added <b>LW</b> <b>band</b> covering 150 kHz through 405 kHz just below the AM broadcast band. There were also slight cosmetic differences to distinguish the two models. Anthony J. Cascarano was the primary designer of the Royal 1000/1000D cabinets. In 1962 the Royal 3000 was added and the 1000D eliminated while the 1000 remained in production through the 1968 model year. The 3000 added the FM broadcast band and eliminated the 13-meter band. Along with a few cosmetic differences, there wasn't much difference electrically between the new model and earlier 1000 series models aside from the addition of the FM subchassis and IF transformers. The 3000 used many of the same cabinet parts as the 1000/1000D, but required a bulging back cover to accommodate the additional parts used for FM.|$|E

However, since the reaction rate for associative detachment is so large, this process is usually not important (but see Chuzhoy et al. 2007; Glover 2007; Wolcott-Green and Haiman 2012). Furthermore, the direct dissociation of H 2 via radiative excitation to the vibrational continuum is highly forbidden.

(1999). These maps are based on a time-independent surface type map published by the IGBP, and laboratory measurements of spectral reflectances of surface materials. These maps represent a first attempt to characterize emissivity based on surface types, and many improvements to the methodology presented here are already underway. Effects of viewing zenith angle and sea state on the emissivity of ocean surface (Smith et al. 1996, Wu and Smith 1997, Masuda et al. 1988) will be taken into account. Measurements form ASTER and MODIS will be incorporated as they become available. Seasonal variation of emissivity based on changes in the characteristics of vegetation will be considered, and the variability of emissivity of barren land areas will be accounted for with the use of Zobler World Soil Maps (Zobler 1986).

40|$|The {{electronic}} {{absorption spectrum}} of 3 -hydroxyflavone (3 HF) in various solvents exhibits a long-wavelength (<b>LW)</b> <b>band,</b> whose origin has been debated. The excited-state dynamics of neutral and basic solutions of 3 HF in alcohols upon excitation in this <b>LW</b> <b>band</b> {{has been investigated}} {{using a combination of}} fluorescence up-conversion and transient electronic and vibrational absorption spectroscopies. The ensemble of results reveals that, in neutral solutions, LW excitation results in the population of two excited species with similar fluorescence spectra but very different lifetimes, namely 40 – 100 ps and 2 – 3 ns, depending on the solvent. In basic solutions, the relative concentrations of these species change considerably in favor of that with the short-lived excited state. On the basis of the spectroscopic data and quantum chemistry calculations, the short lifetime is attributed to the excited state of 3 HF anion, whereas the long one is tentatively assigned to an excited hydrogen-bonded complex with the solvent. Excited-state intermolecular proton transfer from the solvent to the anion yielding the tautomeric form of 3 HF is not operative, as the excited anion decays to the ground state via an efficient nonradiative transition...|$|E
40|$|A fast {{infrared}} {{radiative transfer}} model (FIRTM 2) appropriate for application to both single-layered and overlapping cloud situations is developed for simulating the outgoing infrared spectral radiance {{at the top}} of the atmosphere (TOA). In FIRTM 2 a pre-computed library of cloud reflectance and transmittance values is employed to account for one or two cloud layers, whereas the background atmospheric optical thickness due to gaseous absorption can be computed from a clear-sky radiative transfer model. FIRTM 2 is applicable to three atmospheric conditions: (1) clear-sky, (2) single-layered ice or water cloud, and (3) two simultaneous cloud layers in a column (e. g., ice cloud overlying water cloud). Moreover, FIRTM 2 outputs the derivatives (i. e., Jacobians) of the TOA brightness temperature with respect to cloud optical thickness and effective particle size. Sensitivity analyses have been carried out to assess the performance of FIRTM 2 for two spectral regions, namely the longwave (<b>LW)</b> <b>band</b> (587. 3 – 1179. 5 cm! 1) and the short-to-medium wave (SMW) band (1180. 1 – 2228. 9 cm! 1).

The BTD (F!D) values for single-layered clouds are generally less than 0. 8 K. For the case of two cloud layers (specifically ice cloud over water cloud), the BTD (F!D) values are also generally less than 0. 8 K except for the SMW band for the case of a very high altitude (415 km) cloud comprised of small ice particles.

During sunlit atmospheric conditions, ICON FUV images the limb altitude profile in the shortwave (SW) band at 135. 6 nm and the longwave (<b>LW)</b> <b>band</b> at 157 nm perpendicular to the satellite motion to retrieve the atmospheric O/N 2 ratio. In conditions of atmospheric darkness, ICON FUV measures the 135. 6 nm recombination emission of O+ ions used to compute the nighttime ionospheric altitude distribution. ICON Far Ultra- Violet (FUV) imager is a Czerny–Turner design Spectrographic Imager with two exit slits and corresponding back imager cameras that produce two independent images in separate wavelength bands on two detectors. All observations will be processed as limb altitude profiles. In addition, the ionospheric 135. 6 nm data will be processed as longitude and latitude spatial maps to obtain images of ion distributions around regions of equatorial spread F. The ICON FUV optic axis is pointed 20 degrees below local horizontal and has a steering mirror that allows {{the field of view}} to be steered up to 30 degrees forward and aft, to keep the local magnetic meridian in the field of view. The detectors are micro channel plate (MCP) intensified FUV tubes with the phosphor fiber-optically coupled to Charge Coupled Devices (CCDs). The dual stack MCP-s amplify the photoelectron signals to overcome the CCD noise and the rapidly scanned frames are co-added to digitally create 12 -second integrated images. Digital on-board signal processing is used to compensate for geometric distortion and satellite motion and to achieve data compression. The instrument was originally aligned in visible light by using a special grating and visible cameras. Final alignment, functional and environmental testing and calibration were performed in a large vacuum chamber with a UV source. The test and calibration program showed that ICON FUV meets its design requirements and is ready to be launched on the ICON spacecraft. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are originated from direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) that are formed at z gtrsim 10 in the primordial gas in the case that H 2 cooling is suppressed by strong external radiation. In this work, we study the critical specific intensity J^crit required for DCBH formation for various radiation spectral shapes {{by a series of}} one-zone calculations of a collapsing primordial- gas cloud. We calculate the critical specific intensity at the Lyman-Werner (<b>LW)</b> <b>bands</b> J^crit_LW, 21 (in units of 10 ^- 21 erg s^- 1 Hz^- 1 sr^- 1 cm^- 2) for realistic spectra of metal-poor galaxies. We find J^crit is not sensitive to the age or metallicity for the constant star formation galaxies with J^crit_LW, 21 = 1300 - 1400, while J^crit decreases as galaxies become older or more metal-enriched for the instantaneous starburst galaxies. However, such dependence for the instantaneous starburst galaxies is weak for the young or extremely metal-poor galaxies: J^crit_LW, 21 = 1000 - 1400 for the young galaxies and J^crit_LW, 21 approx 1400 for the extremely metal-poor galaxies. The typical value of J^crit for the realistic spectra is higher than those expected in the literature, which affects the estimated DCBH number density n_DCBH. By extrapolating the result of Dijkstra, Ferrara and Mesinger, we obtain n_DCBH sim 10 ^- 10 cMpc^- 3 at z = 10, although there is still large uncertainty in this estimation.

40|$|The direct {{collapse}} {{model of}} supermassive black hole seed formation provides an attractive {{solution to the}} origin of the quasars now routinely observed at z ≳ 6. We use the adaptive mesh refinement code Enzo to simulate the collapse of gas at high redshift, including a nine species chemical model of H, He, and H_ 2. The direct collapse model requires that the gas cools predominantly via atomic hydrogen. To this end we simulate the effect of an anisotropic radiation source on the collapse of a halo at high redshift. The radiation source is placed at a distance of 3 kpc (physical) from the collapsing object. The source is set to emit monochromatically {{in the center of the}} Lyman-Werner (<b>LW)</b> <b>band</b> only at 12. 8 eV. The LW radiation emitted from the high redshift source is followed self-consistently using ray tracing techniques. We find that, due to self-shielding, a small amount of H_ 2 is able to form at the very center of the collapsing halo even under very strong LW radiation. Furthermore, we find that a radiation source, emitting > 10 ^ 54 (∼ 10 ^ 3 J_ 21) photons per second is required to cause the collapse of a clump of M ∼ 10 ^ 5 M_. The resulting accretion rate onto the collapsing object is ∼ 0. 25 M_ yr^- 1. Our results display significant differences, compared to the isotropic radiation field case, in terms of H_ 2 fraction at an equivalent radius. These differences will significantly effect the dynamics of the collapse. With the inclusion of a strong anisotropic radiation source, the final mass of the collapsing object is found to be M ∼ 10 ^ 5 M_. This is consistent with predictions for the formation of a supermassive star or quasi-star leading to a supermassive black hole. Comment: 18 pages.

In this study, detailed analyses are performed on the CERES Single Scanner Footprint TOA/Surface Fluxes and Clouds product to understand the radiative effect of thin cirrus. The data are acquired over the Florida area during the Cirrus Regional Study of Tropical Anvils and Cirrus Layers Florida Area Cirrus Experiment (CRYSTAL-FACE) field program. Of particular interest is the anisotropy associated with the radiation field. Measured CERES broadband radiances are compared to those obtained from rigorous radiative transfer simulations. Analysis of results from this comparison indicates that the simulated radiances tend to be larger than their measured counterparts, with differences ranging from 2. 1 % to 8. 3 % for the <b>LW</b> <b>band</b> and from 1. 7 % to 10. 6 % for the WIN band. The averaged difference in radiance is approximately 4 % for both the LW and WIN channels. A potential cause for the differences could be the presence of thin cirrus (i. e., optically thin ice clouds with visible optical thicknesses smaller than approximately 0. 3). The detection and quantitative analysis of these thin cirrus clouds are challenging even with sophisticated multispectral instruments. While large differences in radiance between the CERES observations and the theoretical calculations are found, the corresponding difference in the anisotropic factors is very small (0. 2 %). Furthermore, sensitivity studies show that the influence due to a 1 K bias of the surface temperature on the errors of the LW and WIN channel radiances is of the same order as that associated with a 2 % bias of the surface emissivity. The LW and WIN errors associated with a 5 % bias of water vapor amount in the lower atmosphere in conjunction with a 50 % bias of water vapor amount in the upper atmosphere {{is similar to that of}} a 1 K bias of the vertical temperature profile. Even with the uncertainties considered for these various factors, the simulated LW and WIN radiances are still larger than the observed radiances if thin cirrus clouds are excluded...|$|E
40|$|Contract was {{to pursue}} {{feasibility}} {{studies of the}} SOFIA Widefield Imaging Fabry-Perot (SWIFT). SWIFT was proposed as a two color 18 to 40 microns imaging Fabry-Perot that utilized two Rockwell/Boeing 256 x 256 pixel Si:Sb BIBs as detective devices. The colors were to be split between 26 and 30 microns using a MgO dichroic. The resolution achieving devices were to be a pair of cryogenic fully tunable scanning Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPIs), two in each band. For high resolving powers, a third, fixed FPI is inserted into the beam. The FPI mirrors were {{to be made of}} free standing metal mesh. We also proposed to look into a long wavelength (40 to 210 microns) band during the feasibility study period. We produced a proposal to USRA, submitted in July 1997 that substantially refined our ideas. We decided the long wavelength science was compelling, so the baseline wavelength coverage for SWIFT was widened to 17 to 205 microns. Under typical operations, we proposed to simultaneously image in two bands: 22 to 38 microns, and 50 to 205 microns. The bands were to be split by a cold CaF 2 dichroic. The short wavelength (SW) band was to employ a 256 x 256 pixel Boeing/Rockwell Si:Sb BIB array, and the long wavelength (<b>LW)</b> <b>band</b> was to employ a Goddard 6 x 32 (upgradable to 32 x 32) element array of monolithic silicon "pop-up" bolometers as detective devices. The two color capability doubled the data taking efficiency, and ensured "perfect" registration between the images obtained in each band. For the SW band, the beam was to be fully sampled (0. 7 " pixels, 1. 4 in. beam) at 17 microns, and over sampled at longer wavelengths. Even so, SWIFT has a very large (3 ft x 3 ft) field of view. To match the SW and LW fields of view (initially in one dimension only, but in 2 -dimensions with 32 x 32 upgrade), SWIFT was to under sample at 63 microns (5. 6 in pixels, 5. 2 in beam) resulting in a 0. 56 x 3 in (upgrade to 3 in x 3 in) field of view. Each band has both Lo-Res (R triple bond lambda/Delta(lambda) approx. 30 to 200) and Hi-Res (R approx. 1000 up to 10 (exp 5)) modes, that can be changed in less than a minute. Spectral resolution is obtained with four identical cryogenic, fully tunable, scanning FPIS, two in each band, plus a set of fixed order FPI that can be rotated into the beam for good spectral purity at the highest resolving powers.

30|$|Analytic {{considerations}} {{as well as}} simulations {{have indicated}} that the first stars had masses M_*∼ 100 M_, possibly with a large scatter around this value. For the purpose of stellar evolution, I therefore only consider massive Population III stars, even though calculations for their low-mass counterparts exist (Chieffi et al. 2001; Goriely and Siess 2001; Siess et al. 2002; Gil-Pons et al. 2005, 2007; Suda et al. 2007; Lawlor et al. 2008; Lau et al. 2008; Mocák et al. 2010). Massive Population III stars have low opacities due {{to the absence of}} metals, and ignite nuclear burning at very high temperatures as a result of inefficient proton-proton and CNO burning (e.g. El Eid et al. 1983; Bond et al. 1984; Marigo et al. 2001). They are therefore expected to be smaller and hotter than Population I/II stars of the same mass. The spectral shape of the radiation emitted by Population III stars on the main sequence may be derived by combining stellar structure calculations with detailed LTE and non-LTE model atmospheres (Cojazzi et al. 2000; Tumlinson and Shull 2000; Bromm et al. 2001 b; Schaerer 2002, 2003). These studies concluded that massive Population III stars radiate approximately as blackbodies with an effective temperature of ≃ 10 ^ 5 K, and produce up to an order of magnitude more UV photons per stellar baryon than normal stars. Depending on mass, they emit most of their radiation in the <b>LW</b> <b>bands</b> in the range of ≃ 11.2 - 13.6 eV, or above the H[*] i, He[*]i, or He[*]ii ionizing thresholds of approximately 13.6, 24.6, and 54.4 eV, respectively.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that HD {{molecules}} can form efficiently in metal-free gas collapsing into massive protogalactic halos at high redshift. The resulting radiative cooling by HD can lower the gas temperature to that of the cosmic microwave background, T_CMB= 2. 7 (1 +z) K, significantly below the temperature of a few 100 K achievable via H_ 2 -cooling alone, and thus reduce the masses of the first generation of stars. Here we consider the suppression of HD-cooling by UV irradiation in the Lyman-Werner (<b>LW)</b> <b>bands.</b> We include photo-dissociation of both H_ 2 and HD, and explicitly compute the self-shielding and shielding of both molecules by neutral hydrogen as well as the shielding of HD by H_ 2. We use a simplified dynamical collapse model, and follow the chemical and thermal evolution of the gas, {{in the presence of a}} UV background. We find that a LW flux of J_crit = 1 e- 22 erg/cm^ 2 /sr/s/Hz is able to suppress HD cooling and thus prevent collapsing primordial gas from reaching temperatures below 100 K. The main reason for the lack of HD cooling for J>J_crit is the partial photo-dissociation of H_ 2, which prevents the gas from reaching sufficiently low temperatures (T< 150 K) for HD to become the dominant coolant; direct HD photo-dissociation is unimportant except for a narrow range of fluxes and column densities. Since the prevention of HD-cooling requires only partial H_ 2 photo-dissociation, the critical flux J_crit is modest, and is below the UV background required to reionize the universe at redshift z= 10 - 20. We conclude that HD-cooling can reduce the masses of typical stars only in rare halos forming well before the epoch of reionization. Comment: 14 pages with 9 figures, submitted to MNRA...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We have {{developed}} a new ISOCAM data reduction technique based on wavelet analysis, especially designed {{for the detection of}} faint sources in mid-infrared surveys. This method, the Pattern REcognition Technique for Isocam data (PRETI) has been used to reduce the observations of the Hubble Deep Field (HDF) and flanking fields with ISOCAM at 6. 75 (LW 2) and 15 µm (LW 3) (Rowan-Robinson et al. 1997). Simulations of ISOCAM data allow us to test the photometric accuracy and completeness of the reduction. According to these simulations, the PRETI source list is 95 % complete in the 15 µm band at 200 µJy and in the 6. 75 µm band at 65 µJy, using detection thresholds which minimize the number of false detections. We detect 49 objects in the ISO-HDF at high confidence secure level, 42 in the LW 3 filter, 3 in the LW 2 filter, and 4 in both filters. An additional, less secure, list of 100 sources is presented, of which 89 are detected at 15 µm only, 7 at 6. 75 µm only and 4 in both filters. All ISO-HDF objects detected in the HDF itself have optical or infrared counterparts, except for one from the additional list. All except one of the radio sources detected in the field by Fomalont et al. (1997) are detected with ISOCAM. Using a precise correction for the field of view distortion of ISO-CAM allows us to separate blended sources. This, together with the fact that PRETI allows to correct data on the tail of cosmic rays glitches, lead us to produce deeper source lists than previous authors. Our list of bright sources agree with those of Désert et al. (1998) in both filters, and with those of Goldschmidt et al. (1997) in the LW 3 filter, with systematic difference in photometry.

40|$|Accurate {{accounting}} of surface emissivity {{is essential for}} the retrievals of surface temperature from remote sensing measurements, and for the computations of longwave (LW) radiation budget of the Earth?s surface. Past studies of the above topics assumed that emissivity for all surface types, and across the entire LW spectrum is equal to unity. There is strong evidence, however, that emissivity of many surface materials is significantly lower than unity, and varies considerably across the LW spectrum. We have developed global maps of surface emissivity for the broadband LW region, the thermal infrared window region (8 - 12 micron), and 12 narrow <b>LW</b> spectral <b>bands.</b> The 17 surface types defined by the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP) were adopted as such, and an additional (18 th) surface type was introduced to represent tundra-like surfaces. Laboratory measurements of spectral reflectances of 10 different surface materials were converted to corresponding emissivities. The 10 surface materials were then associated with 18 surface types. Emissivities for the 18 surface types were first computed for each of the 12 narrow spectral bands. Emissivities for the broadband and the window region were then constituted from the spectral band values by weighting them with Planck function energy distribution...|$|R

We present here a study that compares the observed band-by-band CRE over the tropical oceans with those simulated by three different atmospheric GCMs (GFDL AM 2, NASA GEOS- 5, and CCCma CanAM 4) forced by observed SST. The models agree with observation on the annual]mean LW broadband CRE over the tropical oceans within +/- 1 W/sq m. However, the differences among these three GCMs in some bands can be as large as or even larger than +/- 1 W/sq m. Observed seasonal cycles of f(sub CRE) in major bands are shown {{to be consistent with}} the seasonal cycle of cloud top pressure for both the amplitude and the phase.

To aid in this understanding single and multifrequency VLF and RMT responses for some typical resistivity structures are analyzed. An analytic model is presented for obtaining unique transfer functions from measurements of the electromagnetic components on board an air-plane or on the ground. Examples of 2 D inversion of ground and airborne VLF profiles in Sweden are shown to demonstrate the quantitative interpretation of VLF data in terms of both lateral and depth changes of the resistivity in the uppermost crust. Geothermal resources are ideal targets for Electromagnetic (EM) methods since they produce strong variations in underground electrical resistivity. Modelling of Magnetotelluric (MT) data in SW Iceland indicates an alteration zone beneath the surface, where there are no obvious geothermal manifestations, in between Hengill and Brennisteinsfjoll geothermal systems. It suggests that a hydrothermal fluid circulation exists at depth. It also proves that the MT method, with its ability to map deep conductive features can play a valuable role in the reconnaissance of deep geothermal systems in active rift regimes such as in Iceland. A damped nonlinear least-squares inversion approach is employed to invert Controlled Source Tensor MT (CSTMT) data for azimuthal anisotropy in a 1 D layered earth. Impedance and tipper data are inverted jointly. The effects of near-surface inhomogeneities are parameterized in addition to each layer parameter(s). Application of the inversion algorithm to both synthetic and field data shows that the CSTMT method can be used to detect azimuthal anisotropy under realistic conditions with near surface lateral heterogeneities...|$|R
40|$|We {{present results}} of a deep {{mid-infrared}} survey in the SSA 13 field with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). In order to probe the near-infrared light at high redshifts, we surveyed the field with the broad <b>band</b> <b>LW</b> 2 (5 - 8. 5 um) filter of the mid-infrared camera ISOCAM. Adopting a highly redundant imaging strategy for the 23 hour observation and carefully treating gradual changes in the detector responsivity caused by a very high rate of cosmic ray impacts, we succeeded in reaching an 80 % completeness limit of 16 uJy in the central 7 arcmin 2 region. Utilizing the signal-to-noise ratio map, we detected 65 sources down to 6 uJy in the 16 arcmin 2 field. Integral galaxy number counts at 6. 7 um are then derived, reaching 1. 3 e 4 /deg 2 at the faint limit with a slope of - 1. 6 between 13 uJy and 130 uJy. Integrating individual sources in this flux range, the resolved fraction of the extragalactic background light at 6. 7 um {{is estimated to be}} 0. 56 nW/m 2 /sr. These results, which reach a flux limit three times fainter than those in the Hubble Deep Fields, are in fairly good agreement with a model prediction by Franceschini et al. (1997). Finally, we discuss the relation of distant massive E/S 0 galaxies to the faint 6. 7 um galaxy population.

40|$|Satellite ocean color {{data from}} the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) and the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) are {{examined}} to investigate decadal trends in the Yellow and East China Seas (YECS). Our goal is {{to determine whether there}} have been changes in chlorophyll concentration and suspended sediment as indicated by changes in satellite-derived optical properties during the past two decades. We compare water-leaving radiance measurements at 443 nm and 555 nm 1, and discuss possible reasons for the changes observed (whether they are artifacts of the different sensors and algorithms or real changes in the water properties). The CZCS pigment data were converted to chlorophyll concentration using an algorithm derived from in situ data to be consistent with the SeaWiFS chlorophyll derived by the OC 4 algorithm (O'Reilly et al. 2000). The shallow coastal areas of the YECS exhibited high water-leaving radiance in the 555 -nm <b>band</b> (<b>Lw</b> 555) during both time periods, indicating that these waters are sediment-dominated case- 2 waters. Between the CZCS era (1978 - 1984) and the SeaWiFS era (1998 - 2002), Lw 443 increased in these areas by 17 % 67 - 108 %. In the deeper waters that are considered case- 1 during summer, Lw 443 decreased by 25 %chlorophyll and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Between the CZCS and SeaWiFS eras, the average chlorophyll concentration (based on case- 1 algorithms) increased by 15 - 60 % in these offshore deep waters. For comparison with the trends found in satellite data, we examined in situ data from 61 stations located off the western coast of Korea that had been sampled six times per year between 1978 and 2002.
