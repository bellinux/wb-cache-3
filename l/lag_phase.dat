5|$|Bacterial growth follows four phases. When a {{population}} of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase of growth is the <b>lag</b> <b>phase,</b> a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth. The <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced. The second phase of growth is the log phase, {{also known as the}} logarithmic or exponential phase. The log phase is marked by rapid exponential growth. The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the growth rate (k), and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the generation time (g). During log phase, nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The third phase of growth is the stationary phase and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport. The final phase is the death phase where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die.|$|E

25|$|This {{logistic}} model of growth {{is produced by}} a population introduced to a new habitat or with very poor numbers going through a <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> of slow growth at first. Once it reaches a foothold population it will go through a rapid growth rate that will start to level off once the species approaches carrying capacity. The idea of maximum sustained yield is to decrease population density {{to the point of}} highest growth rate possible. This changes the number of the population, but the new number can be maintained indefinitely, ideally.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To explore neurophysiological {{biomarkers}} of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), {{we investigated}} electroencephalography (EEG) of AD patients, and assessed <b>lagged</b> <b>phase</b> synchronization, {{a measure of}} brain functional connectivity.

Results: Patients with AD showed significantly decreased <b>lagged</b> <b>phase</b> synchronization between most cortical regions in delta band relative to controls. There also was a decrease in <b>lagged</b> <b>phase</b> synchronization between the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the right posterior-inferior parietal lobule (pIPL) in theta band.

25|$|Soon after inoculation, yeast {{begin to}} rapidly consume the {{available}} assimilable nitrogen {{with up to}} 46% of YAN being fully consumed by the onset of full fermentation. Because inorganic nitrogen, such as the ammonium salts in DAP, are toxic to yeast in high levels, it is never added during inoculation when the biomass of the newly re-hydrated yeast is low. Many winemakers split up the dosage of DAP with the first addition being made {{at the end of}} the <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> when the yeast enter their period of exponential growth and alcoholic fermentation begins. In most must this is around 48 to 72 hours after inoculation. A second dosage is then often added around a third of the way through sugar fermentation and often before the sugar levels hit 12-10 Brix (6.5 to 5.5 Baumé, 48.3 to 40.0 Oechsle) because as the fermentation progresses yeast cells are no longer able to bring the nitrogen into the cell due to the increasing toxicity of ethanol surrounding the cells. This leaves the nitrogen unused and available for spoilage organisms that may come afterwards.|$|E
2500|$|Beutler {{pursued a}} remarkably eclectic {{research}} career, and made fundamental contributions {{in many different}} areas of science over 56 years of active publication. [...] His first scientific paper was published in 1952, and concerned the effect of X-irradiation on susceptibility to influenza virus in mice. [...] This {{was an attempt to}} determine whether irradiated mice might offer a better experimental model in which to detect human viral infections. [...] Not long afterward, he published a paper on the <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> of E. coli, which is also influenced by X-irradiation. [...] This work, carried out during his residency in the laboratory of Leon O. Jacobson, was aimed at the development of an assay for a humoral radioprotective factor, and reflected a chance observation. [...] Beutler also developed an early interest in iron metabolism, prompted by his clinical observation of the rapid symptomatic improvement of iron deficient patients treated with iron: [...] an improvement that preceded any major hematologic change, and showed that numerous enzymes were sensitive to iron deficiency.|$|E
2500|$|Diacetyl {{production}} is favored in fermentations that run warm with temperatures between 18°C (64.4°F) and 25°C (77°F). It {{also tends to}} be produced at higher levels in wines with lower pH levels (under 3.5), though at levels below 3.2, most strains of LAB desirable for MLF tend to be inhibited. [...] "Wild" [...] (as in uninoculated) malolactic ferments {{have the potential to}} produce more diacetyl than inoculated ferments due to the lower initial populations during the <b>lag</b> <b>phase</b> with inoculated ferments usually having an initial inoculum of 106 CFU/ml. Late MLF inoculations, after alcoholic fermentation, also tend to produce higher levels of diacetyl. Chardonnay producers desiring to make the high-diacetyl [...] "buttery style" [...] will often do late or [...] "wild" [...] inoculation in the barrel after primary fermentation, allowing the wine to spend several weeks or even months sur lie in reductive conditions that promote diacetyl production. Some sources point out that diacetyl is actually decreased by sur lie, due to surviving yeast metabolizing diacetyl, and therefore malolactic fermentation is best performed apart from lees.|$|E
40|$|We find <b>lag</b> <b>phases</b> {{exceeding}} 20 mm {{in measuring}} cre-. atine kinase activity, {{by using the}} kinetic creatine phos-phate- creatine assay, in sera of some patients with carcinoma metastatic to the liver. Such long <b>lag</b> <b>phases</b> are accompanied by a decreased apparent enzyme ac-tivity. These problems are eliminated by adding sulthydryl agents to the serum before assay, but not by adding more of such agents to the assay reagent. fl-Mercaptoethanol is superior to Cleland’s reagents, glutathione, and cysteine. The long <b>lag</b> <b>phases</b> could not be explained by inadequate activity of the coupling enzymes, interference with the coupling steps, high proportions of cardiac isoenzyme activity, simple oxidation of the enzyme, low concentra-tions of albumin, or increased concentrations of glutathione reductase, lactate dehydrogenase, or uric acid. We con-clude that the prolonged <b>lag</b> <b>phases</b> reflect inadequate reactivation of the enzyme by sulfhydryl agents under the usual assay conditions.

40|$|There are {{proposals}} {{to overcome the}} current incompatibilities between the time scales of protein folding and molecular dynamics simulation by using {{a large number of}} short simulations of only tens of nanoseconds (distributed computing). According to the principles of first-order kinetic processes, a sufficiently large number of short simulations will include, de facto, a small number of long time scale events that have proceeded to completion. But protein folding is not an elementary kinetic step: folding has a series of early conformational steps that lead to <b>lag</b> <b>phases</b> {{at the beginning of the}} kinetics. The presence of these <b>lag</b> <b>phases</b> can bias short simulations toward selecting minor pathways that have fewer or faster lag steps and so miss the major folding pathways. Attempts to circumvent the lags by using loosely coupled parallel simulations that search for first-order transitions are also problematic because of the difficulty of detecting transitions in molecular dynamics simulations. Nevertheless, the procedure of using parallel independent simulations is perfectly valid and quite feasible once the time scale of simulation proceeds past the <b>lag</b> <b>phases</b> into a single exponential region...|$|R

Results showed that the optimum aw for growth was at 0. 98 - 0. 995 and 25 Â°C. The limit for growth of the strains was at 0. 92 - 0. 93 aw with minima of 10 Â°C. No growth occurred at 37 Â°C. The <b>lag</b> <b>phases</b> prior to growth were lowest under optimum conditions and extended to > 10 days at marginal conditions. Statistical analyses of intra and inter- strain differences {{in terms of both}} <b>lag</b> <b>phases</b> prior to growth and growth rates were not statistically significant. However, aw and temperature were statistically significant factors. Two dimensional profiles for strains from each country of origin were built to identify optimum and marginal conditions for F. langsethiae for the first time.

Indigenous catabolic activity was measured via the addition of C- 14 -phenanthrene using the respirometric soil slurry assay. Notably, the <b>lag</b> <b>phases,</b> fastest rates and total extents of C- 14 -phenanthrene degradation were relatively comparable in soils with similar TOC content after 1 d contact time. However, natural soils generally exhibited significantly shorter <b>lag</b> <b>phases,</b> faster rates and higher extents of mineralisation, than their artificial counterparts after 42 and 84 d contact time. Such findings suggest that the extrapolation of results from artificial soils to real/natural soils may not be straightforward. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
