40|$|There is an ever-growing {{demand for}} high {{precision}} machining to obtain increased accuracy and surface finish, {{as they are}} key factors in product quality and performance. Machining operations, in general, are associated with errors of varying magnitude originating from different sources. As a result, the sizes of the machined features usually deviate from their desired, nominal values. Identification of error sources, techniques of measurements (on/off line), and efficient strategies for their compensation are the steps required to minimize, and, in some cases eliminate process errors. This paper focuses on modeling and compensation of geometric errors in machining operations specific to the <b>line</b> <b>boring</b> process. It {{is part of an}} undergoing research project focused on design and development of an agile precision <b>line</b> <b>boring</b> station for machining of long bores. After a brief overview of sources of geometric errors and their components, a methodology for their calculation is introduced. In this regard, error equations reflecting the effects of machine tool geometric errors at the tool tip are derived. It is shown that these equations can be further simplified without significantly affecting computational accuracy of the results. This makes the approach more attractive for real-time applications. A set of experimental data obtained from a prototype of the machine is used to study the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the results are reported. The paper concludes with discussions and presentation of different methods and available tools for real time compensation of these errors...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to realize a simple {{simulation}} tool, in order to predict the form defect of cylinder block bore liners in the moment of rough boring process. In this study a simple static FEM model, based on the cylinder block geometry, is proposed to predict the form defect of the bore liners in the moment of process. The simulation results put forward that the clamping condition plays an import role in the bore distortion. Consequently, optimizing the clamping pressure and its localization is critical, before cutting parameters adjustment, in <b>line</b> <b>boring</b> process. Experimental validation is performed in parallel with the simulation. The first correlation between experimentation and simulation results shows that the first influent factor which disturbs the correlation is the initial form defect of rough part due to the casting process. Integration of casting form defect in the simulation is crucial and should be taken into account in the next studies.

40|$|For rotating-tool machining, such as milling, <b>line</b> <b>boring,</b> and {{cylinder}} boring, {{the tool}} rotation causes the machining force on each tooth to rotate repetitively {{relative to the}} inertial coordinate frame. This is quite different than stationary-tool machining, such as turning or boring with a stationary boring bar, in which the force directions are fixed relative to the inertial frame. Although the subject of stability analysis for rotating tools has been studied extensively in milling, the process is intermittent and hence time varying, which leads to analysis methods that are either analytically approximate or employ timedomain simulation. In this paper nonintermittent machining processes that employ a rotating tool are modeled and analyzed in the rotational coordinates both to simplify the stability analysis and to permit an exact solution. Using rotating-bar boring to illustrate, the analytical {{results show that the}} stability limits for boring with a rotating boring bar are quite different from those for boring with a stationary boring bar, and the experimental validation is also provided. Furthermore, the results show a discrepancy to exist between the predicted stability limits for the exact and approximate solutions, especially at low spindle speeds. In both cases an explanation is provided based on the analysis presented. �DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 1536657 �...|$|E

50|$|Another {{key feature}} {{cited in the}} {{reliability}} of the Saiga is that the rifle is designed to have loose tolerances between moving parts. These loose tolerances allow more space between the moving parts of the rifle, and they allow the rifle to push any dirt and debris out of the way when the action cycles. All Saiga rifles have a hammer-forged chrome-lined barrel, which influences the Saiga's reliability by making the inside of the barrel more resilient to corrosion and enabling the rifle to withstand more rounds to be fired out of the barrel without an adverse effect on accuracy. This allows the firearms barrel to be cleaned easier than that of a non-chrome <b>lined</b> <b>bore.</b>|$|R
40|$|The diffractive {{resolution}} on a collisionless shock formed along the spatial {{profile of a}} beam in a nematic liquid crystal is considered, this material being {{an example of a}} self-focusing, nonlocal medium.
