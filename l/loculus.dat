25|$|On May 24, 1802, in the Catacombs of Priscilla on the Via Salaria Nova, an inscribed <b>loculus</b> (space {{hollowed}} {{out of the}} rock) was found, and {{on the following day}} it was carefully examined and opened. The <b>loculus</b> was closed with three terracotta tiles, on which was the following inscription: lumena paxte cumfi. It was and is generally accepted that the tiles had not been positioned in the sequence of the words, and that the inscription originally read, with the leftmost tile placed on the right: pax tecum Filumena ("Peace with you, Philomena"). Within the <b>loculus</b> was found the skeleton of a female between thirteen and fifteen years old. Embedded in the cement was a small glass phial with vestiges of what was taken to be blood. In accordance with the assumptions of the time, the remains were taken to be those of a virgin martyr named Philomena. Her name means 'daughter of light'. Philomena is the patron saint of infants, babies, and youth.|$|E
500|$|The {{origin of}} the puzzle's name is unclear, {{and it has been}} {{suggested}} that it is taken from the Ancient Greek word for throat or gullet, stomachos (...) [...] Ausonius refers to the puzzle as Ostomachion, a Greek compound word formed from the roots of [...] (osteon, bone) and [...] (machē, fight). The puzzle is also known as the <b>Loculus</b> of Archimedes or Archimedes' Box.|$|E
2500|$|The city flourished {{under the}} [...] "Pax Romana", as {{evidenced}} by high-level urban planning and extensive construction, including the best preserved Roman theatre of ancient Samaria, {{as well as a}} hippodrome, a cardo and other trademarks of the Roman influence. Mount Gilboa, [...] away, provided dark basalt blocks, as well as water (via an aqueduct) to the town. Beit She'an is said to have sided with the Romans during the Jewish uprising of 66 CE. Excavations have focused less on the Roman period ruins, so not much is known about this period. The Penn. University Museum excavation of the northern cemetery, however, did uncover significant finds. The Roman period tombs are of the <b>loculus</b> type: a rectangular rock-cut spacious chamber with smaller chambers (loculi) cut into its side. Bodies were placed directly in the loculi, or inside sarcophagi which were placed in the loculi. A sarcophagus with an inscription identifying its occupant in Greek as [...] "Antiochus, the son of Phallion", may have held the cousin of Herod the Great. One of the most interesting Roman grave finds was a [...] with the handle {{in the form of an}} animal leg, or hoof, now in the University of Pennsylvania Museum.|$|E
40|$|The {{continuity}} {{of a number}} of the traditions which are going back to a funeral ceremony of Middle Sarmatiаn culture is observed in the burial grounds of Caspian Dagestan dating back to {{the second half of the}} 2 nd - first half of the 5 th centuries. The signs of this culture are gradually transformed in these traditions. It was complicated by the influences of traditions of Late Sarmatian culture (orientation of some corpses); the traditions of early Sarmatian population are more significant: catacombs of type II, narrow pits and <b>loculuses,</b> the western orientation of the corpse. The author highlights the major importance of the results of contacts between the descendants of the Middle Sarmatiаn culture and the population of Alan North Caucasus culture, manifested in the spread of the catacombs of type I and the formation of the catacombs of type IV under their influence. At the same time there is a sharp decrease in the proportion of burials in narrow rectangular pits and the disappearance of the diagonal position of corpses (middle 3 rd- 4 th Centuries A. D.), that leads to the formation of a ritual complex, fixed in Lvovsky cemeteries. This complex was moved from its native territory of the Terek-Sulak interfluve to the Southern Dagestan in the 1 st half - the middle of the 4 th century A. D., where it was preserved until the 1 st half - the middle of the 5 th century A. D. This completes the process of development of the Middle Sarmatian ritual complex in the region which absorbed a number of traditions of Early Sarmatian time. The complex existed in relative isolation from the late cultural Sarmatian influences, but it was affected by bearers of Alan culture. Considering also that formation of Alan culture passed on the basis of culture of the population of the region in the 2 nd century B. C. - 1 st century A. D. under the influence of a middle Sarmatian migratory impulse, the author assumes that carriers of the Middle Sarmatian traditions with the assistance of the population of plains of the central and East regions of the North Caucasus of early Sarmatian time played the defining role in cultural and historical processes of the 1 st half of 1 st millennium A. D. in this territory...|$|R

'Lifting the <b>Loculus</b> and Body, therefore, {{they carried}} it to the Altar; and I put-to my sinful hand to help in carrying, though the Abbot had {{commanded}} that none should approach except called. And the <b>Loculus</b> {{was placed in the}} Shrine; and the pannel it had stood on was put in its place, and the Shrine for the present closed. We all thought that the Abbot would show the <b>Loculus</b> to the people; and bring out the Sacred Body again, at a certain period of the Festival. But in this we were wofully mistaken, as the sequel shows.|$|E

6000|$|... 'The Festival of St. Edmund now approaching, {{the marble}} blocks are polished, {{and all things}} are in {{readiness}} for lifting of the Shrine to its new place. A fast of three days was held by all the people, the cause and meaning thereof being publicly set forth to them. The Abbot announces to the Convent that all must prepare themselves for transferring of the Shrine, and appoints time and way for the work. Coming therefore that night to matins, we found the great Shrine (feretrum magnum) raised upon the Altar, but empty; covered all over with white doeskin leather, fixed to the wood with silver nails; but one pannel of the Shrine was left down below, and resting thereon, beside its old column of the Church, the <b>Loculus</b> with the Sacred Body yet lay where it was wont. Praises being sung, we all proceeded to commence our disciplines (ad disciplinas suscipiendas). These finished, the Abbot and certain with him are clothed in their albs; and, approaching reverently, set about uncovering the <b>Loculus.</b> There was an outer cloth of linen, enwrapping the <b>Loculus</b> and all; this we found tied on the upper side with strings of its own: within this was a cloth of silk, and then another linen cloth, and then a third; and so at last the <b>Loculus</b> was uncovered, and seen resting on a little tray of wood, that {{the bottom of it}} might not be injured by the stone. Over the breast of the Martyr, there lay, fixed {{to the surface of the}} <b>Loculus,</b> a Golden Angel about the length of a human foot; holding in one hand a golden sword, and in the other a banner: under this there was a hole in the lid of the <b>Loculus,</b> on which the ancient servants of the Martyr had been wont to lay their hands for touching the Sacred Body. And over the figure of the Angel was this verse inscribed: ...|$|E

6000|$|Strange gray old silent Town, rich {{in so many}} memories; {{it stands}} there, straggling up its rocky hill-edge, towards its old Castles and edifices on the top, in a not unpicturesque manner; flanked by the river Lahn and its fertile plains: very silent, except for the delirious screech, at rare intervals, of a railway train passing that way from Frankfurt-on-Mayn to Cassel. [...] "Church of St. Elizabeth,"--high, grand Church, built by Conrad our Hochmeister, in reverence of his once {{terrestrial}} Sister-in-law,--stands conspicuous in the plain below, where the Town is just ending. St. Elizabeth's Shrine was once there, and pilgrims wending to it from all lands. Conrad himself is buried there, as are many Hochmeisters; their names, and shields of arms, Hermann's foremost, though Hermann's dust is not there, are carved, carefully kept legible, on the shafts of the Gothic arches,--from floor to groin, long rows of them;--and produce, with the other tombs, tomb-paintings by Durer and the like, thoughts impressive almost to pain. St. Elizabeth's <b>LOCULUS</b> was put into its shrine here, by Kaiser Friedrich II. {{and all manner of}} princes and grandees of the Empire, [...] "one million two hundred thousand people looking on," [...] say the old records, perhaps not quite exact in their arithmetic. Philip the Magnanimous, wishing to stop [...] "pilgrimages no-whither," [...] buried the <b>LOCULUS</b> away, it was never known where; under the floor of that Church somewhere, as is likeliest. Enough now of Marburg, and of its Teutsch Ritters too.|$|E
60|$|Clearly enough, meanwhile, the Altar, {{whatever}} {{the burning of}} it mean or foreshadow, must needs be reëdified. Abbot Samson reëdifies it, all of polished marble; with the highest stretch of art and sumptuosity, reëmbellishes the Shrine {{for which it is}} to serve as pediment. Nay farther, as had ever been among his prayers, he enjoys, he sinner, a glimpse of the glorious Martyr's very Body in the process; having solemnly opened the <b>Loculus,</b> Chest or sacred Coffin, for that purpose. It is the culminating moment of Abbot Samson's life. Bozzy Jocelin himself rises into a kind of Psalmist solemnity on this occasion; the laziest monk 'weeps' warm tears, as Te Deum is sung.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The Convent {{therefore}} {{being all}} asleep, these Twelve, clothed in their albs, with the Abbot, assembled at the Altar; and opening a pannel of the Shrine, {{they took out}} the Loculus; laid it on a table, near where the Shrine used to be; and made ready for unfastening the lid, which was joined and fixed to the <b>Loculus</b> with sixteen very long nails. Which when, with difficulty, they had done, all except the two forenamed associates are ordered to draw back. The Abbot and they two were alone privileged to look in. The <b>Loculus</b> was so filled with the Sacred Body that you could scarcely put a needle between the head and the wood, or between the feet and the wood: the head lay united to the body, a little raised with a small pillow. But the Abbot, looking close, found now a silk cloth veiling the whole Body, and then a linen cloth of wondrous whiteness; and upon the head was spread a small linen cloth, and then another small and most fine silk cloth, {{as if it were}} the veil of a nun. These coverings being lifted off, they found now the Sacred Body all wrapt in linen; and so at length the lineaments of the same appeared. But here the Abbot stopped; saying he durst not proceed farther, or look at the sacred flesh naked. Taking the head between his hands, he thus spake, groaning: [...] "Glorious Martyr, holy Edmund, blessed be the hour when thou wert born. Glorious Martyr, turn it not to my perdition that I have so dared to touch thee, I miserable and sinful; thou knowest my devout love, and the intention of my mind." [...] And proceeding, he touched the eyes; and the nose, which was very massive and prominent (valde grossum et valde eminentem); and then he touched the breast and arms; and raising the left arm he touched the fingers, and placed his own fingers between the sacred fingers. And proceeding he found the feet standing stiff up, like the feet of a man dead yesterday; and he touched the toes and counted them (tangendo numeravit).|$|E
6000|$|Two other {{important}} sets of catacombs, which I {{will call the}} [...] "buttressed caves," [...] are pierced in the right flank of the same gorge, {{at the base of}} a little conical hill, quaintly capped with a finial of weathered rock. The material is the normal silicious gravel-grit, traversed and cloisonné by dykes of harder stone. Beginning at the south, we find a range of three, facing eastward and separated from one another by flying buttresses of natural rock. No. 1 has a window as well as a door. Next to it is a square with six open loculi ranged from north to south. No. 3 shows a peculiarity--two small pilasters of the rudest (Egyptian?) Doric, the only sign of ornamentation found inside the tombs; a small break in the south-western wall connects it with the northernmost <b>loculus</b> of No. 2. Furthest north are three bevel-holes, noting the beginning of a catacomb; and round the northern flank of the detached cone are six separate caves, all laid waste by the furious northern gales.|$|E
6000|$|But however {{this may}} be, St. Edmund's <b>Loculus,</b> we find, has the veils of silk and linen reverently replaced, the lid {{fastened}} down again with its sixteen ancient nails; is wrapt {{in a new}} costly covering of silk, the gift of Hubert Archbishop of Canterbury: and through the sky-window John of Dice sees it lifted to {{its place in the}} Shrine, the pannels of this latter duly refixed, fit parchment documents being introduced withal;--and now John and his vestrymen can slide down from the roof, for all is over, and the Convent wholly awakens to matins. 'When we assembled to sing matins,' says Jocelin, 'and understood what had been done, grief took hold of all that had not seen these things, each saying to himself, [...] "Alas, I was deceived." [...] Matins over, the Abbot called the Convent to the great Altar; and briefly recounting the matter, alleged that it had not been in his power, nor was it permissible or fit, to invite us all to the sight of such things. At hearing of which, we all wept, and with tears sang Te Deum laudamus; and hastened to toll the bells in the Choir.' ...|$|E
60|$|The rest of St. Edmund's history, for {{the reader}} sees he {{has now become a}} Saint, is easily conceivable. Pious munificence {{provided}} him a <b>loculus,</b> a feretrum or shrine; built for him a wooden chapel, a stone temple, ever widening and growing by new pious gifts;--such the overflowing heart feels it a blessedness to solace itself by giving. St. Edmund's Shrine glitters now with diamond flowerages, with a plating of wrought gold. The wooden chapel, as we say, has become a stone temple. Stately masonries, long-drawn arches, cloisters, sounding aisles buttress it, begirdle it far and wide. Regimented companies of men, of whom our Jocelin is one, devote themselves, in every generation, to meditate here on man's Nobleness and Awfulness, and celebrate and show forth the same, as they best can,--thinking they will do it better here, in presence of God the Maker, and of the so Awful and so Noble made by Him. In one word, St. Edmund's Body has raised a Monastery round it. To such length, in such manner, has the Spirit of the Time visibly taken body, and crystallised itself here. New gifts, houses, farms, katalla[6]--come ever in. King Knut, whom men call Canute, whom the Ocean-tide would not be forbidden to wet,--we heard already of this wise King, with his crown and gifts; but of many others, Kings, Queens, wise men and noble loyal women, let Dryasdust and divine Silence be the record! Beodric's-Worth has become St. Edmund's Bury;--and lasts visible to this hour. All this that thou now seest, and namest Bury Town, is properly the Funeral Monument of Saint or Landlord Edmund. The present respectable Mayor of Bury may be said, like a Fakeer (little as he thinks of it), to have his dwelling in the extensive, many-sculptured Tombstone of St. Edmund; in one of the brick niches thereof dwells the present respectable Mayor of Bury.|$|E
