50|$|In 1998, Miss Fear {{returned}} {{in a somewhat}} different form in the four-issue miniseries Guns of the Dragon, by Timothy Truman, starring Enemy Ace and Bat <b>Lash.</b> <b>Set</b> in China, 1927, this story depicted her as a young, half-Chinese / half-Caucasian spy in service of the communists. The plot also involved a recurring Blackhawk villain, the Thunderer, {{as well as a}} brief appearance by Chop-Chop, although his age at that point seems impossible to reconcile with his later career as Blackhawk's sidekick. The outcome of the adventure led Fear to reconsider her loyalty to the communists and suggested her future as a freelance freedom-fighter. However, her only subsequent appearance thus far has been {{in the form of a}} limited edition 1/6 scale G.I. Joe action figure, produced by Dreams & Visions in 2003, licensed by Hasbro and DC Comics.|$|R
50|$|Following Eleanor Roosevelt's {{death in}} 1962, <b>Lash</b> <b>set</b> to work writing {{a memoir of}} her, {{published}} two years later as Eleanor Roosevelt: A Friend's Memoir. This fair and familiar treatment of his friend kept him in the Roosevelt family's eye. Two years {{after the publication of}} this book, in 1966, Lash received a telephone call from Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr., the literary executor of his mother. Roosevelt asked whether Lash might like {{to take a look at}} Eleanor Roosevelt's personal papers, with a view to writing a biography. Lash accepted this offer with gusto, quit his job at the Post, and began a five-year project which would culminate in the publication of the first installment of a two-part biography, Eleanor and Franklin. This book, which dealt sympathetically but candidly with the Roosevelts' sometimes troubled marriage, made headlines and garnered critical praise. It won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1972, cementing Lash's prominence as an independent writer. A series of literary projects ensued.|$|R
60|$|It hurt me to urge her on, but {{the memory}} of my mother's agonized face {{and the sound of}} my father's groan of pain steeled my heart. I <b>set</b> <b>lash</b> to her side and so kept her to her highest speed.|$|R
60|$|Visiting cards had, of course, come {{in numbers}} to Willow Lawn, but Albinia {{seemed to have}} caught her husband's aversions, {{and it would be}} {{dangerous}} to say how long it was before she <b>lashed</b> herself into <b>setting</b> off for a round of calls.|$|R
5000|$|Wyatt Earp, a {{man whose}} trigger finger had {{considerable}} to do in making the border history of the West, was in Denver for several days last week. He is tall and athletic. His eyes are blue and fringed with light <b>lashes</b> and <b>set</b> beneath blonde eyebrows. His hair, which was once as yellow as gold, is beginning to be stranded with white. A heavy, tawny mustache shades his firm mouth and sweeps below his strong, square chin. He wore ... a neat gray tailor-made suit, immaculate linen and fashionable neckwear. With a Derby hat {{and a pair of}} tan shoes, he was a figure to catch a lady's eye ...|$|R
50|$|The {{houses were}} built so that planks {{on the walls}} and roofs could be taken off and used at other places, as the people moved seasonally. Paired {{uprights}} supported rafters, which, in turn, held roof planks that overlapped like tiles. Wall planks were <b>lashed</b> between <b>sets</b> of poles. The position of these poles depended on the lengths of the boards they held, and they were evidently set and reset through the years the houses were occupied. Walls met at the corners by simply butting together. They stayed structurally independent, allowing for easy dismantling. There were no windows. Light and ventilation came by shifting the position of roof planks, which were simply weighted with rocks, not fastened in position.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the days}} of wooden construction, sprung masts were a serious problem, because their {{structural}} integrity was compromised, and the next gust of wind could easily bring them down. Upper masts were usually just replaced by spares carried for the purpose. The usual recourse for the lower mast was to [...] "fish" [...] it by <b>lashing</b> a special <b>set</b> of spars to the mast along the cracked area.|$|R
50|$|Pentti placed {{second in}} the 10,000 meters at the 1932 United States Olympic Trials, {{qualifying}} for the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles; at the Olympics he failed to finish, due to being sick with fever, as did the two other Americans. He captured his first Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) championship title in the 10,000 meters in 1934; he won the championship again in 1937 and 1938. At the 1936 Olympic Trials Pentti placed second a hundred yards behind Don <b>Lash,</b> who <b>set</b> a new American record of 31:06.9. He qualified for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, where he placed 16th. In 1938 he returned to Berlin for the Germany - USA games and this time won the 10,000 meters race.|$|R
5000|$|... "Chaos Theory" [...] is {{the seventh}} {{episode of the}} third season of the American {{television}} series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division), revolving around the character of Phil Coulson {{and his team of}} S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they deal with the monstrous <b>Lash.</b> It is <b>set</b> in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. The episode was written by Lauren LeFranc, and directed by David Solomon.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{selling of}} slaves, {{that is to}} say, the {{breaking}} up of families and selling them separately, is horrible and abominable. If an estate were sold together with all the slaves upon it, {{there would be no}} more hardship in the matter than there is when an estate changes hands in England, and the laborers upon it work for the new master instead of the old. Were I to liberate all the slaves on this estate to-morrow and to send them North, I do not think that they would be in any way benefited by the change. They would still have to work for their living as they do now, and being naturally indolent and shiftless would probably fare much worse. But against the selling of families separately and the use of the <b>lash</b> I <b>set</b> my face strongly.|$|R
500|$|... "Laws of Nature" [...] is {{the first}} episode of the third season of the American {{television}} series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division), revolving around the character of Phil Coulson {{and his team of}} S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they hunt for Inhumans, who are also being hunted by the new Advanced Threat Containment Unit and the monstrous <b>Lash.</b> It is <b>set</b> in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. The episode was written by Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen, and directed by Vincent Misiano.|$|R
60|$|Under {{the rays}} of the lamp it was {{possible}} to discern more closely the features of the black-jack exponent. There was a subtle but noticeable resemblance to those of Mr. Bat Jarvis. Apparently the latter's oiled forelock, worn low over the forehead, was more a concession to the general fashion prevailing in gang circles than an expression of personal taste. Mr. Repetto had it, too. In his case it was almost white, for the fallen warrior was an albino. His eyes, which were closed, had white <b>lashes</b> and were <b>set</b> as near together as Nature had been able to manage without actually running them into one another. His under-lip protruded and drooped. Looking at him, one felt instinctively that no judging committee of a beauty contest would hesitate a moment before him.|$|R
60|$|It will be {{seen that}} the XXth of the Articles of War provides, that if any person in the Navy negligently perform the duties {{assigned}} him, he shall suffer such punishment as a court-martial shall adjudge; but if the offender be a private (common sailor) he may, {{at the discretion of}} the Captain, be put in irons or flogged. It is needless to say, that in cases where an officer commits a trivial violation of this law, a court-martial is seldom or never called to sit upon his trial; but in the sailor's case, he is at once condemned to the <b>lash.</b> Thus, one <b>set</b> of sea-citizens is exempted from a law that is hung in terror over others. What would landsmen think, were the State of New York to pass a law against some offence, affixing a fine as a penalty, and then add to that law a section restricting its penal operation to mechanics and day laborers, exempting all gentlemen with an income of one thousand dollars? Yet thus, in the spirit of its practical operation, even thus, stands {{a good part of the}} naval laws wherein naval flogging is involved.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} 19 {{individuals}} with a recurrent de novo c. 607 C>T mutation in PACS 1. This specific mutation {{gives rise to a}} recognizable intellectual disability syndrome. There is a distinctive facial appearance (19 / 19), characterized by full and arched eyebrows, hypertelorism with downslanting palpebral fissures, long eye <b>lashes,</b> ptosis, low <b>set</b> and simple ears, bulbous nasal tip, wide mouth with downturned corners and a thin upper lip with an unusual "wavy" profile, flat philtrum, and diastema of the teeth. Intellectual disability, ranging from mild to moderate, was present in all. Hypotonia is common in infancy (8 / 19). Seizures are frequent (12 / 19) and respond well to anticonvulsive medication. Structural malformations are common, including heart (10 / 19), brain (12 / 16), eye (10 / 19), kidney (3 / 19), and cryptorchidism (6 / 12 males). Feeding dysfunction is presenting in infancy with failure to thrive (5 / 19), gastroesophageal reflux (6 / 19), and gastrostomy tube placement (4 / 19). There is persistence of oral motor dysfunction. We provide suggestions for clinical work-up and management and hope that the present study will facilitate clinical recognition of further cases...|$|R
5000|$|The {{desmodromic}} system avoids this problem, {{because it}} does not have to overcome the static energy of the spring. It must work against the momentum of the valve opening and closing, and that force still depends on the effective mass of the moving parts. The effective mass of a traditional valve with spring includes one-half of the valve spring mass and all of the valve spring retainer mass. However, a desmodromic system must deal with the inertia of the two rocker arms per valve, so this advantage depends greatly on the skill of the designer. Another disadvantage is the contact point between the cams and rocker arms. It is relatively easy to use roller tappets in conventional valvetrains, although it does add considerable moving mass. In a desmodromic system the roller would be needed {{at one end of the}} rocker arm, which would greatly increase its moment-of-inertia and negate its [...] "effective mass" [...] advantage. Thus, desmo systems have generally needed to deal with sliding friction between the cam and rocker arm and therefore may have greater wear. The contact points on most Ducati rocker arms are hard-chromed to reduce this wear. Another possible disadvantage is that it would be very difficult to incorporate hydraulic valve lash adjusters in a desmodromic system, so the valves must be periodically adjusted, but this is true of typical performance oriented motorcycles as valve <b>lash</b> is typically <b>set</b> using a shim under a cam follower.|$|R
6000|$|In the Bohemian Club of San Francisco {{there are}} some crack sailors. I know, because I heard them pass {{judgment}} on the Snark {{during the process of}} her building. They found only one vital thing the matter with her, and on this they were all agreed, namely, that she could not run. She was all right in every particular, they said, except that I'd never be able to run her before it in a stiff wind and sea. [...] "Her lines," [...] they explained enigmatically, [...] "it is the fault of her lines. She simply cannot be made to run, that is all." [...] Well, I wish I'd only had those crack sailors of the Bohemian Club on board the Snark the other night for them to see for themselves their one, vital, unanimous judgment absolutely reversed. Run? It is the one thing the Snark does to perfection. Run? She ran with a sea-anchor fast for'ard and a full mizzen flattened down aft. Run? At the present moment, as I write this, we are bowling along before it, at a six-knot clip, in the north-east trades. Quite a tidy bit of sea is running. There is nobody at the wheel, the wheel is not even <b>lashed</b> and is <b>set</b> over a half-spoke weather helm. To be precise, the wind is north-east; the Snark's mizzen is furled, her mainsail is over to starboard, her head-sheets are hauled flat: and the Snark's course is south-south-west. And yet there are men who have sailed the seas for forty years and who hold that no boat can run before it without being steered. They'll call me a liar when they read this; it's what they called Captain Slocum when he said the same of his Spray.|$|R
