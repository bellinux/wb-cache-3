5|$|A 2005 {{report issued}} {{jointly by the}} Ministry of Health (Saudi Arabia) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention details five cases of bubonic plague in humans {{resulting}} from the ingestion of raw camel liver. Four of the five patients had severe pharyngitis and submandibular <b>lymphadenitis.</b> Yersinia pestis was isolated from the camel's bone marrow, from the jird (Meriones libycus) and from fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis) captured at the camel's corral.|$|E
5|$|The touch was {{originally}} meant to cure tuberculous cervical <b>lymphadenitis</b> (commonly {{referred to as}} scrofula or the King's Evil), rheumatism, convulsions, fevers, blindness, goitre and other ailments. Since the reign of Elizabeth I (r. 1558–1603), however, the touch was applied only to people suffering from scrofula. The Henrician practice was rarely modified, and the changes were minor; Elizabeth I {{made the sign of}} the cross above the infected person's head, while her squeamish successor, James I (r. 1603–1625), made stroking motions above the abscesses instead of actually touching them.|$|E
5|$|The royal touch (also {{known as}} the king's touch) {{was a form of}} laying on of hands, whereby French and English monarchs touched their subjects, {{regardless}} of social classes, with the intent to cure them of various diseases and conditions. The thaumaturgic touch was most commonly applied to people suffering from tuberculous cervical <b>lymphadenitis</b> (better known as scrofula or the King's Evil), and exclusively to them from the 16th century onwards. The disease rarely resulted in death and often went into remission on its own, giving the impression that the monarch's touch cured it. The claimed power was most notably exercised by monarchs who sought to demonstrate the legitimacy of their reign and of their newly founded dynasties.|$|E
25|$|BCG vaccine {{should be}} given intradermally. If given subcutaneously, it may induce local {{infection}} and spread to the regional lymph nodes, causing either suppurative and nonsuppurative <b>lymphadenitis.</b> Conservative management is usually adequate for nonsuppurative <b>lymphadenitis.</b> If suppuration occurs, it may need needle aspiration. For nonresolving suppuration, surgical excision may be required. Evidence {{for the treatment of}} these complications is scarce.|$|E
25|$|Since {{alveolar}} osteitis is {{not primarily}} an infection, {{there is not}} usually any pyrexia (fever) and cervical <b>lymphadenitis</b> (swollen glands in the neck), and only minimal edema (swelling) and erythema (redness) {{is present in the}} soft tissues surrounding the socket.|$|E
25|$|Following treatment, {{if there}} are {{systemic}} signs and symptoms, such as facial or neck swelling, cervical <b>lymphadenitis,</b> fever or malaise, a course of oral antibiotics is often prescribed,. Common antibiotics used are from the β-lactam antibiotic group, clindamycin and metronidazole.|$|E
25|$|The UK and WHO {{recommendation}} is 2HREZ/4HR; the US {{recommendation is}} 2HREZ/7HR. There is good evidence from randomised-controlled trials {{to say that}} in tuberculous <b>lymphadenitis</b> and in TB of the spine, the six-month regimen is equivalent to the nine-month regimen; the US recommendation is therefore not supported by the evidence.|$|E
25|$|Steroids may be {{of benefit}} in peritonitis, miliary disease, {{tubercular}} osteomyelitis, TB osteomyelitis, laryngeal TB, <b>lymphadenitis</b> and genitourinary disease, but the evidence is scant and the routine use of steroids cannot be recommended. Steroid treatment in these patients should be considered {{on a case by}} case basis by the attending physician.|$|E
25|$|The {{secondary}} stage most often occurs 10–30 days later, but can present {{up to six}} months later. The infection spreads to the lymph nodes through lymphatic drainage pathways. The most frequent presenting clinical manifestation of LGV among males whose primary exposure was genital is unilateral (in 2/3 of cases) <b>lymphadenitis</b> and lymphangitis, often with tender inguinal and/or femoral lymphadenopathy because of the drainage pathway for their likely infected areas. Lymphangitis of the dorsal penis may also occur and resembles a string or cord. If the route was anal sex the infected person may experience <b>lymphadenitis</b> and lymphangitis noted above. They may instead develop proctitis, inflammation limited to the rectum (the distal 10–12cm) that may be associated with anorectal pain, tenesmus, and rectal discharge, or proctocolitis, inflammation of the colonic mucosa extending to 12cm above the anus and associated with symptoms of proctitis plus diarrhea or abdominal cramps.|$|E
25|$|Sporobolomyces salmonicolor is {{generally}} interpreted to be a Biosafety Risk Group 1 fungus. It {{is considered an}} opportunistic fungal pathogen of immunocompromised individuals and {{has been reported in}} AIDS-related infections. Sporobolomyces salmonicolor has been associated with nasal polyps, <b>lymphadenitis,</b> bone marrow involvement in AIDS patients, infected skin, pseudomeningitis and a case of endophthalmitis. S.salmonicolor is also considered a type 1 allergen and has been known to cause asthma, nosocomial allergic alveolitis, and rhinitis.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{symptoms}} {{may include}} inflammatory {{involvement of the}} perirectal or perianal lymphatic tissues. In females, cervicitis, perimetritis, or salpingitis may occur as well as lymphangitis and <b>lymphadenitis</b> in deeper nodes. Because of lymphatic drainage pathways, some patients develop an abdominal mass which seldom suppurates, and 20–30% develop inguinal lymphadenopathy. Systemic signs which can appear include fever, decreased appetite, and malaise. Diagnosis is more difficult in {{women and men who}} have sex with men (MSM) who may not have the inguinal symptoms.|$|E
25|$|When the lymphatic {{impairment}} {{becomes so}} great that the lymph fluid exceeds the lymphatic system's ability to transport it, an abnormal amount of protein-rich fluid collects in the tissues. Left untreated, this stagnant, protein-rich fluid causes tissue channels to increase in size and number, reducing oxygen availability. This interferes with wound healing and provides a rich culture medium for bacterial growth that can result in infections: cellulitis, lymphangitis, <b>lymphadenitis</b> and in severe cases, skin ulcers. It is vital for lymphedema patients {{to be aware of the}} symptoms of infection and to seek immediate treatment, since recurrent infections or cellulitis, in addition to their inherent danger, further damage the lymphatic system and set up a vicious circle.|$|E
25|$|Sporoidiobolus salmonicolor is a yeast-like fungus in the Basidiomycota more {{commonly}} {{known by the}} name of its asexual yeast-like state, Sporobolomyces salmonicolor. It is generally considered a Biosafety Risk Group 1 fungus; however isolates of S.salmonicolor have been recovered from cerebrospinal fluid, infected skin, a nasal polyp, <b>lymphadenitis</b> and a case of endophthalmitis. It has also been reported in AIDS-related infections. The fungus exists predominantly in the asexual state as a unicellular, haploid yeast yet this species can sometimes produce a sexual state when conjugation of compatible yeast cells occurs. The asexual form consists of a characteristic, pink, ballistosporic yeast. Ballistoconidia are borne from slender extensions of the cell known as sterigma, and are forcibly ejected into the air upon maturity. Levels of airborne yeast cells peak during the night and are abundant in areas of decaying leaves and grains. Three varieties of Sporobolomyces salmonicolor have been described; S.salmonicolor var. albus, S.salmonicolor var. fischerii, and S.salmonicolor var. salmoneus.|$|E

2500|$|Louis-Charles died on 8 June 1795. The {{next day}} an autopsy was {{conducted}} by Pelletan, at which it was stated that a child apparently about ten years of age, [...] "which the commissioners told us was the late Louis Capet's son", {{had died of a}} scrofulous infection of long standing. [...] "Scrofula" [...] as it was previously known, is nowadays called Tuberculous cervical <b>lymphadenitis</b> referring to a <b>lymphadenitis</b> (chronic lymph node swelling or infection) of the neck (cervical lymph nodes) lymph nodes associated with tuberculosis.|$|E
2500|$|Up to 25% of {{patients}} with TB of the lymph nodes (TB <b>lymphadenitis)</b> will get worse on treatment before they get better and this usually happens {{in the first few}} months of treatment. A few weeks after starting treatment, lymph nodes often start to enlarge, and previously solid lymph nodes may soften and develop into tuberculous cervical <b>lymphadenitis.</b> [...] This should not be interpreted as failure of therapy and is a common reason for patients (and their physicians) to panic unnecessarily. [...] With patience, two to three months into treatment the lymph nodes start to shrink again and re-aspiration or re-biopsy of the lymph nodes is unnecessary: if repeat microbiological studies are ordered, they will show the continued presence of viable bacteria with the same sensitivity pattern, which further adds to the confusion: physicians inexperienced in the treatment of TB will then often add second-line drugs in the belief that the treatment is not working. [...] In these situations, all that is required is re-assurance. [...] Steroids may be useful in resolving the swelling, especially if it is painful, but they are unnecessary. [...] Additional antibiotics are unnecessary and the treatment regimen does not need to be lengthened.|$|E
2500|$|Already well-liked by the {{prospective}} bride's domineering grandmother, the middle-aged Earl of Chesterfield proposed marriage by writing from The Hague to the Dowager Duchess on 14 August 1731: [...] "The person, the merit {{and the family}} of Lady Diana Spencer are objects so valuable that they must necessarily have ... caused many such applications of this nature to Your Grace." [...] The Dowager Duchess, however, turned him down too. Waiting for a wealthy suitor with both a title and appropriate political leanings almost {{proved to be a}} great mistake when Lady Diana developed tuberculous cervical <b>lymphadenitis,</b> requiring the Dowager Duchess to pay a prominent surgeon to hide the traces of the disfiguring disease.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lymphadenitis,</b> the {{swelling}} of the lymph nodes, is a commonly recognized symptom of many diseases. An early manifestation of filariasis, <b>lymphadenitis</b> more frequently occurs in the inguinal area during B. malayi infection and can occur before the worms mature.|$|E
50|$|The {{classical}} histologic {{pattern of}} scrofula features caseating granulomas with central acellular necrosis (caseous necrosis) surrounded by granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells.
