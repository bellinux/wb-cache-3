25|$|Locomotives 1100 to 1111 {{were painted}} {{in a plain}} black livery, {{matching}} that of the VR steam locomotive fleet. During the 1960s the ten box-cabs were painted in {{a variation of the}} blue and gold livery applied to the VR diesel fleet. The locomotives were initially based at the Jolimont Workshops along with the suburban electric multiple unit fleet, as steam locomotives were housed at the North Melbourne <b>Locomotive</b> <b>Depot.</b> However {{with the opening of the}} new South Dynon <b>Locomotive</b> <b>Depot</b> in 1964, the entire E class fleet was relocated there in June 1968.|$|E
25|$|The National Railway Museum was {{established}} on its present site, the former York North <b>locomotive</b> <b>depot,</b> in 1975, when it {{took over the}} former British Railways collection located in Clapham and the York Railway Museum located off Queen Street, immediately to the south east of the railway station; since then, the collection has continued to grow.|$|E

25|$|The {{roundhouse}} at Goulburn was {{a significant}} <b>locomotive</b> <b>depot</b> both in the steam and early diesel eras.

Some minor rail operators such as RailPower have used the site to restore diesel locomotives to working order for main line use.|$|E
25|$|Bathurst {{later became}} the centre of an {{important}} coal-mining and manufacturing region. The Main Western railway line from Sydney reached Bathurst in 1876.

It remains today as the railway regional engineering headquarters with a large rail component manufacturing facility.|$|E
25|$|The High Level Bridge was an {{important}} node on the railway network, and as branch line passenger services and mineral traffic built up it became a bottleneck. This was exacerbated by {{the location of the}} main <b>locomotive</b> <b>depot</b> for Newcastle being located at Gateshead; as many train services changed engines at Newcastle this generated a huge number of light engine movements to and from the depot across the bridge.|$|E

25|$|A {{marshalling}} yard, freight terminal, <b>locomotive</b> <b>depot</b> {{and other}} facilities were established at Pandora Point, with a triangle provided to turn trains and giving direct access north and south from the port branch. The Ahuriri yard was closed. The old main line north to Gisborne was realigned to the east to allow a new link road to the Tamatea area of Napier, and railways land was redeveloped as an industrial subdivision. On 7 October 2001 the Bay Express from Wellington to Napier was cancelled and passenger services on the line ceased.|$|E
5000|$|Some of this sub-class were {{equipped}} for towing ICE trains, {{and used in}} multiple on the new (rebuilt) lines of Cologne-Rhine Main and Nuremberg-Ingolstadt.

50|$|The first open-top hopper wagons were {{introduced}} around 1870. Forty wagons were built with 10-ton capacity, {{and used to}} transport imported coal from the Willaimstown, Geelong and Port Melbourne to <b>locomotive</b> <b>depots</b> in the Melbourne area.

25|$|Hamar {{received}} the railway's administration and became its operational center. The station {{was designed by}} Georg Andreas Bull and construction of the wooden buildings were subcontracted to Chr. Eriksen. The line opened on 23 June 1862. The station had limited facilities with shunting being done by horse. In its original configuration the station had three tracks, a main station building, a <b>locomotive</b> <b>depot</b> and a cargo building. Two tracks received a roof. All buildings were wooden, with the two-story main building a log house with paneling in Swiss chalet style. The upper story was used as housing. About forty people worked at the station from the opening.|$|E
25|$|Holmestrand was {{the main}} depot of HVB and {{included}} a series of operations buildings {{in addition to the}} company's administration. It consisted of a station building, a freight building, an outhouse, a <b>locomotive</b> <b>depot,</b> a wagon shed, a coal shed, a turntable and a guardhouse. The station had five tracks, of which three were spurs. Two of these connected to small turnstiles, which were only large enough to handle freight cars. North of the station the line connected to the Vestfold Line at Holmestrand Station. At Gausen there was en engine shed with two tracks. There were gradually built branch lines to major industrial facilities in town, such as the power company Holmestrand Elektrisitetsverk, Nordisk Aluminium and the fish market.|$|E
25|$|Following {{withdrawal}} from service a number of RM class were stored around the country. Several units along with Vulcan RMs were sold to the abortive Southern Rail preservation project at Christchurch where they were scrapped; the cab and baggage car section of the No.1 end of RM 119 on the leading bogie together with some engines and gearboxes were kept at this time. After the project was wound up, the partial section of RM 119 was moved to Linwood <b>Locomotive</b> <b>Depot</b> where it remained in storage for several years. Subsequently the further abbreviated RM 119 consisting of just the cab {{and part of the}} baggage compartment was stored in a Bromley scrapyard, where it was found and purchased by the RM 133 Trust Board.|$|E
