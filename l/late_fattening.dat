40|$|Marbling {{of cattle}} meat is {{dependent}} on the coordinated expression of multiple genes. Cattle dramatically increase their intramuscular fat content in the longissimus dorsi muscle between 12 and 27 months of age. We used the annealing control primer (ACP) -differential display RT-PCR method to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that may participate in the development of intramuscular fat between early (12 months old) and <b>late</b> <b>fattening</b> stages (27 months old). Using 20 arbitrary ACP primers, we identified and sequenced 14 DEGs. BLAST searches revealed that expression of the MDH, PI 4 -K, ferritin, ICER, NID- 2, WDNMI, telethonin, filamin, and desmin (DES) genes increased while that of GAPD, COP VII, ACTA 1, CamK II, and nebulin decreased during the <b>late</b> <b>fattening</b> stage.

40|$|Abstract: In Romania, {{suckling}} {{lamb meat}} is on demand during the Easter, but growing suckling lambs just {{for this purpose}} is not profitable. The paper performed a comparative study of the fattening aptitudes of the lambs from three local sheep breeds to produce carcasses demanded on the international market. The research was done on three groups (Carabash, Tsigai and Tsurcana breeds) of 16 weaned lambs each, with an initial weight between 21 - 27 kg and continued until the animals reached an weight of 35 - 38 kg. The experiment started {{after a period of}} accommodation to the experimental maintenance and feeding conditions. The animals were kept indoors under similar conditions of feeding and microclimate. The body weight of the animals was measured {{at the beginning and end}} of each fattening period, as well as the average daily gain and the total weight gain for each breed. During the <b>late</b> period of <b>fattening,</b> control weighing was performed until the target weight has been achieved. The Carabash lambs, which had the highest lambing weights of all the investigated breeds, proved to be the most precocious as weight gain. Over 44 fattening days they recorded an average daily gain of 0. 258 ± 0. 016 kg, reaching a slaughtering weight of 38. 46 ± 1. 178 kg with a feed conversion ratio of 4. 66 FU. The Tsigai lambs, less precocious than the Carabash lambs, recorded an average daily gain of 0. 191 ± 0. 043 kg, over 86 days 86, reaching a slaughtering weight of 37. 16 ± 0. 130 kg, with a significantly higher feed conversion ratio, of 6. 35 FU.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of chromium methionine (Cr-Met) chelate supplementation on blood metabolites and fatty acid profile of beef from Holstein steers during <b>late</b> <b>fattening</b> period. Fifteen Holstein steers were allotted randomly into two groups including the control (non Cr-Met feeding, NCM, ave. body weight [BW] = 483 ± 25. 7 kg) and the treatment (Cr-Met feeding for 4 months, 4 CM, ave. BW = 486 ± 27. 5 kg) group. The feeding amount of Cr-Met to animals was limited to 400 ppb/cow/d and was supplemented to total mixed ration. No difference in blood albumin, alkaline phosphatase, urea-nitrogen, calcium, creatine, glucose, total protein, triglyceride, and cholesterol were observed between the treatment groups (p> 0. 05). The level of high density lipoprotein was higher in the 4 CM group than the NCM group, whereas low density lipoprotein was lower in the 4 CM group (p 0. 05). The arachidonic acid level tended to be higher in the 4 CM than the NCM group (p = 0. 07). Cr-Met had no influence (p> 0. 05) on the ratio of saturated, unsaturated, unsaturated/saturated, monounsaturated/saturated and polyunsaturated/saturated fatty acids whereas the ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the 4 CM group was comparatively higher than the NCM group (p< 0. 05).

In a 6 month feeding trial, thirty Hanwoo steers (647 ± 32 kg) were allotted to one of 5 treatment groups, control (basal diet contained lasalocid), licorice, clove, turmeric and silymarin, with six steers per pen. All groups received ad libitum concentrate and 1 kg rice straw/animal/d throughout the feeding trial. Blood samples were collected at the beginning, middle, {{and the end of the}} experiment and the steers were slaughtered at the end. Blood glucose, triglyceride, total protein, and albumin concentrations were higher in the turmeric treatment compared with other treatments. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations were highest (p< 0. 003 and p = 0. 071, respectively) in steers treated with silymarin. Alanine aminotransferase activity was lower (p< 0. 06) for licorice and silymarin compared with the control group. There were no alterations in serum aspartate aminotransferase and gamma glutamyltransferase activities as a consequence of herb treatments (p = 0. 203 and 0. 135, respectively). Final body weight, body weight gain, average dairy gain and dry matter intake were not significantly different among treatments. Yield grade, marbling score and quality grade were higher for silymarin group than those of the control group (p< 0. 05). Therefore, the results suggest that silymarin can be used an effective dietary supplement as an alternative to antibiotic feed additive and a productivity enhancer, providing safe and more consumer acceptable alternative to synthetic compounds during the <b>late</b> <b>fattening</b> period of steers...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of medicinal plant by-products (MPB) supplementation to a total mixed ration (TMR) on growth, carcass characteristics and economic efficacy in the <b>late</b> <b>fattening</b> period of Hanwoo steers. Twenty seven steers (body weight [BW], 573 ± 57 kg) were assigned to 3 treatment groups so that each treatment based on BW contained 9 animals. All groups received ad libitum TMR throughout the feeding trial until slaughter (from 24 to 30 months of age) and treatments were as follows: control, 1, 000 g/kg TMR; treatment 1 (T 1), 970 g/kg TMR and 30 g/kg MPB; treatment 2 (T 2), 950 g/kg TMR and 50 g/kg MPB. Initial and final BW were not different among treatments. Resultant data were analyzed using general linear models of SAS. Average daily gain and feed efficiency were higher (p< 0. 05) for T 1 than control, but {{there was no difference between}} control and T 2. Plasma albumin showed low-, intermediate- and high-level (p< 0. 05) for control, T 1 and T 2, whereas non-esterified fatty acid was high-, intermediate- and high-level (p< 0. 05) for control, T 1 and T 2, respectively. Carcass weight, carcass rate, backfat thickness and rib eye muscle area were not affected by MPB supplementation, whereas quality and yield grades were highest (p< 0. 05) for T 1 and T 2, respectively. Daily feed costs were decreased by 0. 5 % and 0. 8 % and carcass prices were increased by 18. 1 % and 7. 6 % for T 1 and T 2 compared to control, resulting from substituting TMR with 30 and 50 g/kg MPB, respectively. In conclusion, the substituting TMR by 30 g/kg MPB may be a potential feed supplement approach to improve economic efficacy in the <b>late</b> <b>fattening</b> period of Hanwoo steers...|$|E
40|$|Gonadotropin {{releasing}} hormone (GnRH) plays {{a pivotal role}} in fertility and reproduction in mammals. It induces the release of luteinising hormone (LH) en follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary. These hormones are responsible for gonadal steroid production and indirectly for gametogenesis. In this thesis, studies are presented which described the development of a highly immunogenic GnRH antigen, as well as the evaluation of this antigen in vaccines in target species. The native GnRH peptide was enlarged to a GnRH-tandem peptide and immunogenicity was further increased by dimerization of the peptide and introduction of foreign amino acids (G 6 k-GnRH-tandem-dimer). This modified peptide construct was conjugated to ovalbumine. It appeared to be highly effective in immunosterilization, i. e. blocking testosterone production, in male piglets. The role of the individual amino acids of the G 6 k-GnRH-tandem-dimer on immunosterilization efficacy was established, using alanine replacements. All amino acids, except amino acids at position 2 and 3, could be individually replaced by alanine without affecting efficacy of the vaccine. Peptides with alanine replacements at position 1 or 4 did induce antibodies that were specific for GnRH and did not cross-react with other GnRH-isoforms present in mammals. Immunosterilization by vaccination against GnRH could be a suitable alternative for surgical castration in male piglets. Surgical castration prevents boar taint, but is an animal unfriendly practice, as it is performed without anaesthesia. Immunosterilization may also be beneficial for growth performance. Effects of the time of onset of effective immunosterilization on growth performance were studied. Effective immunosterilization early during the fattening period resulted in a growth performance similar to surgical castrates. In contrast, when immunosterilization was initiated <b>late</b> during the <b>fattening</b> period, growth performance was improved over surgical castrates and carcass quality appeared to be similar to intact male pigs. In addition, immunosterilized pigs of both groups could easily be distinguished from intact male pigs by the size of their testes. Two vaccines with the G 6 k-GnRH-tandem-dimer antigen in CoVaccine and Carbopol adjuvant were evaluated in sexually mature male ponies. The CoVaccine-treated stallions showed a high antibody response after the second vaccination, subsequently leading to undetectable testosterone levels and affected testis function, while effects in the Carbopol group were only present in one of the four stallions treated. In humane medicine, GnRH vaccination could be an alternative for hormone therapy in prostate cancer patients. Two potential vaccines with the antigen in ISA 51 and in CoVaccine adjuvant were studied in pigs. The latter vaccine appeared to be more effective. It reduced testosterone levels, weights of testes and accessory sex glands in all treated animals. Both vaccines can be considered as non-toxic; no chronic abnormalities were observed in blood, urine, organs or tissues. In conclusion, this vaccine could be a suitable alternative for surgical castration in pigs, eventually leading to a ban on this animal unfriendly practice in the EU. In human medicine, GnRH vaccination could replace hormone therapy in diseases driven by gonadal steroids. In prostate cancer for instance, GnRH vaccination may be a long term effective, cheap and safe alternative...|$|R
40|$|In boars, social {{relationships}} could influence pubertal development and feeding behaviour. The {{objectives of the}} present study were to determine the relationships between behaviour (agonistic, mounting and feeding behaviours), plasma sex steroids (oestradiol, testosterone) and fat androstenone. A total of 270 Pietrain x Large White boars, derived from four distinct genotypes were used. They were raised in groups of 11 - 12 pigs/pen. Animals were observed for about two times 10 h/day at the beginning or about 6 h at the end of fattening. Agonistic (fighting, hitting, biting, threatening, chasing) and sexual (mounting) behaviours were counted in early fattening shortly after a social mixing (for 177 of the 270 animals) and in <b>late</b> <b>fattening</b> after several weeks of social stability. Skin lesions were counted in the same periods and on carcasses. Data obtained from electronic feeders were used to determine the number and duration of meals, and the feed intake over 96 -h periods in the middle {{and at the end of}} fattening. At the end of fattening, blood was sampled to measure oestradiol and testosterone. At slaughter, fat was collected to measure androstenone. Using the agonistic behaviours, a dominance index was calculated (DRrank). As expected, numbers of skin lesions and agonistic acts were higher in early fattening (P < 0. 0001) whereas that of mounting acts was lower in early than in <b>late</b> <b>fattening</b> (P < 0. 05). The feeding characteristics (r = 0. 25 to 0. 39) were significantly correlated between ages, whereas numbers of mountings (r = 0. 18), of skin lesions (r = 0. 05) and agonistic acts (r =- 0. 05) were not. The number of agonistic acts was significantly correlated with that of mountings only-in early fattening (r = 0. 38). At both ages, no difference between dominance groups was observed for feeding characteristics. This was probably related to low competition between boars for access to feed. Dominant boars had a higher concentration of androstenone in fat than subordinates (P < 0. 05) but no difference was observed for plasma steroids. An active role of androstenone in controlling social behaviour but not reproductive function may explain this phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation of catechins and wheat bran on growth performance, carcass characteristics and meat color using forty-eight Hanwoo steers. Each steer was {{randomly assigned to one of}} four treatments. Treatments were as follows: control, catechins, wheat bran, and catechins+wheat bran (CW). At the end of the feeding trial, blood samples were collected for analysis of hemoglobin and iron concentration, and then steers were slaughtered at a commercial abattoir. Catechins, wheat bran, and CW had no effect on growth performance and carcass characteristics. Percentage of myoglobin in M. longissimus dorsi was not affected by treatments. Percentage of oxymyoglobin was increased (p< 0. 05) by CW and maintained at the highest level (p< 0. 05) for CW during meat display time up to 24 h. Percentage of metmyoglobin was the lowest (p< 0. 05) for CW between 5 and 24 h during display time. Although blood iron concentration was not affected by treatments, total concentration of muscle iron was the lowest (p< 0. 05) for CW compared with that of other treatments. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that CW may provide good protection against oxidation of myoglobin, and might be an effective dietary supplement for improving meat color in the <b>late</b> <b>fattening</b> period of Hanwoo steers...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to investigate the physico-chemical properties of Holstein steer beef loin (M. longissimus dorsi) and top round (M. semimembranosus) from 18, 21 and 24 -mon old. The loin and top round muscles from the 24 -mon group had higher intramuscular fat content (%) than the other groups (p 0. 05). With regard to meat color (CIE), the lightness (L*), redness (a*) and yellowness (b*) values of the loin were significantly higher for the 21 - and 24 -mon groups, {{and those of the}} top round were significantly higher for the 21 -mon group than the same cuts in the other groups. The Warner-Bratzler shear force was the lowest at 24 mon for both the loin and top round muscles (3. 69 kg); however, the water holding capacity was significantly higher for loin muscles from the 21 -mon group (54. 53 %, p< 0. 05). The loin muscles from the 24 -mon group contained significantly higher levels of monounsaturated fatty acid and significantly lower levels of saturated fatty acid than those in the other groups (p< 0. 05). The tenderness, juiciness, flavor-likeness and the overall-likeness scores were significantly higher for beef from the 21 - and 24 -mon groups than that from the 18 -mon group.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} feeding a trace minerals-fortified microbial culture (TMC) on the performance and carcass characteristics of late-fattening Hanwoo steers. A mixture of microbes (0. 6 % [v/w] of Enterobacter sp., Bacillus sp., Lactobacillus sp., and Saccharomyces sp.) was cultured with 99 % feedstuff for ensiling and 0. 4 % trace minerals (zinc, selenium, copper, and cobalt). Sixteen late-fattening steers (mean age, 21. 8 months) were allocated to two diets: a control diet (concentrate mix and rice straw) and a treated diet (control diet+ 3. 3 % TMC). At a mean age of 31. 1 months, all the steers were slaughtered. The addition of TMC to the diet did not affect the average daily weight gain of the <b>late</b> <b>fattening</b> steers, compared with that of control steers. Moreover, consuming the TMC-supplemented diet did not affect cold carcass weight, yield traits such as back fat thickness, longissimus muscle area, yield index or yield grade, or quality traits such as meat color, fat color, texture, maturity, marbling score, or quality grade. However, consumption of a TMC-supplemented diet increased the concentrations of zinc, selenium, and sulfur (p< 0. 05) in the longissimus muscle. With respect to amino acids, animals consuming TMC showed increased (p< 0. 05) concentrations of lysine, leucine, and valine among essential amino acids and a decreased (p< 0. 05) concentration of proline among non-essential amino acids. In conclusion, the consumption of a TMC-supplemented diet during the late-fattening period elevated the concentrations of certain trace minerals and essential amino acids in the longissimus muscle, without any deleterious effects on performance and other carcass characteristics of Hanwoo steers...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to determine whether the two-step time-restricted feeding improves the fattening traits of one-step time-restricted feeding in geese. Thirty-six 8 -wk-old geese were allotted into one of three groups. Group R 1 (the 1 -step restricted feeding group) was allowed access to feed for 2 h in the morning from 8 wk to 14 wk of age. Group R 2 (the 2 -step restricted feeding group) was treated as Group R 1, but was additionally fed for 2 h in the afternoon from 12 wk to 14 wk of age. Group C (the control group) was fed ad libitum from 8 wk to 14 wk of age. Feed intake and body weight (BW) were recorded daily and weekly, respectively. At 14 wk of age, the blood samples were collected to determine the fasting plasma levels of glucose, triacylglycerols and uric acid before sacrifice. The results showed that daily feed intake (DFI) was lower, feed efficiency (FE) was higher in both Groups R 1 and R 2 than in Group C, and daily gain (DG) in Group R 2 was higher than in Group R 1 during the whole experimental period (p< 0. 05). Group R 1 exhibited lower abdominal and visceral fat weights in carcass than did Group C (p< 0. 05), and Group R 2 was in intermediate. The fasting plasma glucose levels in Group C were higher, and triacylglycerol levels in Group R 1 were higher, compared with the other groups (p< 0. 05). It is concluded that time-restricted feeding in the fattening period not only increases FE but reduces DFI, and the additional meal during the <b>late</b> <b>fattening</b> period improves the DG without the expense of FE in geese...|$|E

In comparative slaughter trial, thirty animals were divided into three dry matter intake treatments (ad libitum, n = 18; low restricted, n = 6; high restricted, n = 6), and were all slaughtered as baseline, intermediate, and final slaughter groups, to calculate body chemical components and energy retained. In digestibility trial, twelve ewes were housed in individual metabolic cages and randomly assigned to three feeding treatments {{in accordance with the}} design of a comparative slaughter trial, to evaluate dietary energetic values at different feed intake levels. The combined data indicated that, with increasing age, the net energy requirement for maintenance (NEm) decreased from 260. 62 ± 13. 21 to 250. 61 ± 11. 79 kJ/kg 0. 75 of shrunk body weight (SBW) /d, and metabolizable energy requirement for maintenance (MEm) decreased from 401. 99 ± 20. 31 to 371. 23 ± 17. 47 kJ/kg 0. 75 of SBW/d. Partial efficiency of ME utilization for maintenance (km, 0. 65 vs 0. 68) and growth (kg, 0. 42 vs 0. 41) did not differ (p> 0. 05) due to age; At the similar condition of average daily gain, net energy requirements for growth (NEg) and metabolizable energy requirements for growth (MEg) for ewes during <b>late</b> <b>fattening</b> period were 23 % and 25 % greater than corresponding values of ewes during early fattening period.

40|$|The Coastal Zone of Western Desert (CZWD) Egypt, {{extended}} from Alexandria East to Libyan border West, {{is a hot}} dry area of < 150 mm annual rainfall; the area had faced 14 years of drought from 1995 to 2011. Field survey {{has been carried out}} with the Bedouins in the area to assess the effect of such long drought incidence on their socioeconomic vulnerability and livestock production systems, upon which they rely for sustaining their livelihood. The study covered 182 breeders during the Summer 2011, distributed over 3 agro-ecological zones; the rain-fed area (West), the new reclaimed land (East) and Siwa desert oasis (South). The breeders in the rain-fed area who were affected more by the incidence of drought, had to take some radical measures to cope with such prolonged drought. One of which is reducing their flock size from 201 heads, in average, by 1995 to 115 in 2011. Raising more goats was another means in their adaptive strategy to the incidence of long drought. Goat percent in the oasis flocks has been raised from 32 in 1995 to 56 % in 2011, and in the rain-fed area from 20. 7 to 22. 5 %. Twenty percent of the breeders in the oasis raised only goats. The situation differs in the new reclaimed lands, with the availability of the cultivated green fodder and crop residues, the breeders increased their flock size from 161 heads in 1995 to 234 in 2011, mostly from sheep. Goats contribute significantly to the nutritional status of the householders in the 3 agro ecological zones; in average family consumed 15 % of their goats for the family meat requirement in the rain-fed and oasis areas. More than 50 % of the cash income of the breeders in the rain-fed area during 2011 came from selling weaned kids and lambs, 62 % in the oasis from early fattened kids and lambs, and 42 % in the reclaimed land came from selling <b>late</b> <b>fattening</b> lambs. Raising goats seems to be an effective adaptive process to cope with the long drought incidence in the hot dry region. It contributes significantly to the nutritional status of the family, and an efficient source of income for the householders in the rain-fed area and desert oasis, but not in the reclaimed cultivated lands.
