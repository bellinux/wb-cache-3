40|$|The crystal {{structures}} of L-lysine formate [P 2 j,a = 5. 431 (1), b = 7. 546 (1), c = 12. 095 (2) A,/~ = 93. 42 (1) °, Z = 2] and DL-lysine formate [P 21 /c,a = 10. 205 (2), b= 11. 152 (2), c = 8. 491 (1),~,,fl= 97. 51 (1) °, Z= 4] have been determined and refined to R = 0. 039 and 0. 054 for 1060 and 1689 observed reflections, respectively. Both the structures consist of alternating layers of unlike molecules. The aggregation {{pattern in the}} lysine layer in the L-lysine complex, with a straight and a zigzag head-to-tail sequence interconnecting the molecules, is almost {{the same as that}} observed in <b>L-lysine</b> <b>acetate,</b> L-lysine L-aspartate and L-lysine D-aspartate. In the DL-lysine complex, hydrogen-bonded dimers of lysine are inter- connected by head-to-tail sequences, as in DL-lysine hydrochloride. The structures thus demonstrate the relative invariance of certain aggregation and interaction patterns involving lysine. The relative invariance also extends to interactions between the side-chain amino group and the formate ions...|$|E
40|$|Growing protoplasts of Streptococcus faecalis 9790 {{were found}} to {{synthesize}} and excrete soluble peptidoglycan fragments. The presence of soluble peptidoglycan derivatives in culture supernatants was determined by (i) incorporation of three different radioactively labeled precursors (<b>L-lysine,</b> D-alanine, and <b>acetate)</b> into products which, after hen egg-white lysozyme hydrolysis, had the same KD values on gel filtration as muramidase hydrolysis products of isolated walls; (ii) inhibition of net synthesis of these products by cycloserine and vancomycin; and (iii) identification of disaccharide-peptide monomer using the beta-elimination reaction, gel filtration, and high-voltage paper electrophoresis. Under the conditions of these experiments the presence of newly synthesized, acid-precipitable (macromolecular) peptidoglycan was not detected. The predominance of monomer (70 to 80 %) in lysozyme digests of peptidoglycan synthesized by protoplasts was {{in sharp contrast to}} digest of walls from intact streptococci which contain mostly peptide cross-linked products. Biosynthesis and release of relatively uncross-linked, soluble peptidoglycan fragments by protoplasts was related to the absence of suitable, preexisting acceptor wall...|$|R
