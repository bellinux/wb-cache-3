25|$|If {{enough people}} do not think like free-riders, the private and {{voluntary}} provision of public goods may be successful. For example, a free rider might come to a public park to enjoy its beauty, yet discard litter that makes it less enjoyable for others. More public-spirited individuals don't do this (they might even pick up existing litter) – why? There could be several reasons. Perhaps they have lived nearby for years and derive pleasure from helping their community, or at least would feel ashamed if their neighbors or friends saw them. Perhaps they are emotionally attached to the environment, or the park is a national treasure; littering it would offend their patriotism. To the extent that most people behave <b>like</b> <b>this</b> (<b>for</b> any reason), a public good is produced: everyone enjoys a clean park, without the government needing to spend tax money on maintenance crews.|$|E
25|$|The {{geological}} {{age of the}} Caribbean Sea {{is estimated}} to be between 160 and 180million years and was formed by a horizontal fracture that split the supercontinent called Pangea in the Mesozoic Era. It is assumed the proto-caribbean basin existed in the Devonian period. In the early Carboniferous movement of Gondwana to the north and its convergence with the Euramerica basin decreased in size. The next stage of the Caribbean Sea's formation began in the Triassic. Powerful rifting {{led to the formation of}} narrow troughs, stretching from modern Newfoundland to the west coast of the Gulf of Mexico which formed siliciclastic sedimentary rocks. In the early Jurassic due to powerful marine transgression, water broke into the present area of the Gulf of Mexico creating a vast shallow pool. The emergence of deep basins in the Caribbean occurred during the Middle Jurassic rifting. The emergence of these basins marked the beginning of the Atlantic Ocean and contributed to the destruction of Pangaea at the end of the late Jurassic. During the Cretaceous the Caribbean acquired the shape close to that seen today. In the early Paleogene due to Marine regression the Caribbean became separated from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean by the land of Cuba and Haiti. The Caribbean remained <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> most of the Cenozoic until the Holocene when rising water levels of the oceans restored communication with the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

Kolbe also praised the writing saying that [...] "I wish there was more writing <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> television. I think we'd have a much healthier industry." [...] Robinson said that Garak was a complicated character which required the use of subtext, adding that it wasn't {{a simple way to}} portray a character [...] "but when you do it well, you really get people's attention". He was told by the producers that they intended to bring him back onto the show, but in a later interview, he said that this was commonplace in the industry and doesn't usually occur. When he was brought back for the second-season episode [...] "", executive producer Ira Steven Behr apologized for not bringing him back sooner.|$|E

Mainly targeting women, the tour commenced on November2,2008 and concluded on November25,2008. The tour's female-focused concept {{was inspired by}} other male recording artists who [...] "did things special <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> their female fans", such as Teddy Pendergrass, Marvin Gaye and Prince. Enjoying the challenge of a female-only tour, Usher said, [...] "There [...] only a few artists that can pull that off, I feel like I've had such a connection with my audience. This album, I felt like, was definitely the type of one that was more intimate. So {{what better way to}} get up close and personal than to make it all women?" [...] Usher performed the tour with a Dsquared2 wardrobe. At each show, one fan was brought onstage [...] "for an even more intimate experience with the singer". This took place during [...] "Superstar"; a female fan was served champagne and strawberries by Usher while sitting on his lap as he sang to her. Among Usher's own songs, the setlist also included portions of Stevie Wonder's [...] "Rocket Love", Gaye's [...] "I Want You" [...] and Prince's [...] "Do Me, Baby". At the Detroit show he also gave T-Baby's [...] "It's So Cold in the D". Usher was supported by a five-piece band, three backing vocalists and four backup dancers.|$|E

2500|$|The H10 Bletcham Way {{starts as}} a dual {{carriageway}} at the three-way Granby Roundabout with the V6 Grafton Street and V4 Watling Street at Denbigh.

Baby Doe lived <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> 35 years. [...] During these years she wrote incessantly. In diaries, letters, and scraps she called [...] "Dreams and Visions", consisting of about 2000 fragments later found bundled in piles of paper in her cabin, she wrote entries such as: [...] "Nov. 26—1918 Papa Tabor's Birthday I owe my room rent & am in need of food and only enough bread for tonight & breakfast.... my shoes and stockings only 1 pair are in rags."

Six years later, Rucker signed to Capitol Nashville as a country music singer, releasing the album, Learn to Live that year.

2500|$|Parsimony {{affected}} the organisation of the Historical Section {{and the speed}} it could publish the History.... Premises, visits to battlefields {{and the number of}} historians and administrators were limited and in 1922, Edmonds threatened to resign if denied more help. Along with Daniel and Edmonds, the section had only three or four full-time officers, who had to write the volumes, prepare them for publication, maintain the library, study prisoner of war (POW) records and foreign official and non-official publications (in their native language) and provide help for the War Office, War Graves Commission, Staff College, educational establishments and government departments. The section had about [...] a year to its cramped offices in Cavendish Square, until it moved to the Audit Office in 1922. By 1924, Edmonds had five administrators and eight writers, when the French and German equivalents had about [...] the British staff were also underpaid, A. F. Becke being refused a salary increase from £500 per annum. Edmonds got the money instead, from £560 to £800 per annum and then £1,000 per annum in 1924, when he was writing most of the histories, managing the section and working a seven-day-week for three months, then taking ten days off (Edmonds worked <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> much of the [...] of the project). A 1927 proposal for Cyril Falls (2 March 1888 – 23 April 1971) to visit Mesopotamia for £200 was vetoed by the Treasury but £50 was allowed for Aspinall-Oglander to visit Gallipoli.|$|E
2500|$|The {{details of}} the cases vary widely: In the 1444 Frankfurt cases and the 1499 Hanau case, the dogs were dead prior to be hanged, and in the late 1615 and 1661 cases in Frankfurt, the Jews (and dogs) were merely kept in this torture for half an hour, before being garroted from below. In the 1588 Bergen case, all three victims were left hanging till they were dead, ranging from 6 to 8 days after being hanged. In the Dortmund 1486 case, the dogs bit the Jew to death while hanging. In the 1611 Öttingen case, the Jew [...] "Jacob the Tall" [...] thought {{to blow up the}} [...] "Deutsche Ordenhaus" [...] with {{gunpowder}} after having burgled it. He was strung up between two dogs, and a large fire was made close to him, and he expired after half an hour under this torture. In the 1553 Württemberg case, the Jew chose to convert to Christianity after hanging <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> 24 hours; he was then given the mercy to be hanged in the ordinary manner, from the neck, and without the dogs beside him. In the 1462 Halle case, the Jew Abraham also converted after 24 hours hanging upside down, and a priest went up on a ladder and baptised him. For two more days, Abraham was left hanging, while the priest argued with the city council that a true Christian should not be punished in this way. On the third day, Abraham was granted a reprieve, and was taken down, but died 20 days later in the local hospital having meanwhile suffered in extreme pain. In the 1637 case, where the Jew had murdered a Christian jeweller, the appeal to the empress was successful, and out of mercy, the Jew was condemned to be merely pinched with glowing pincers, have hot lead dripped into his wounds, and then be broken alive on the wheel.|$|E
