Traditional gender roles in Pakistan define the woman's place as {{in the home and}} not in the workplace, and define the man as the breadwinner. Consequently, the society invests far less in women than men. Women in Pakistan suffer from poverty of opportunities throughout their lives. Female literacy in Pakistan is 43.6% compared to Male literacy at 68.2%, as of 2008. In legislative bodies, women constituted less than 3% of the legislature elected on general seats before 2002.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} degree to which {{academic}} librarians in Nigeria are committed to accepting the use of impact factor for assessing their academic performance. Fifty copies of a questionnaire were distributed and 41 returned. Descriptive statistics using means and percentages were used to generate data. A majority of the respondents disagreed that impact factor had wider acceptance than any alternative. More than half did not agree that many Nigerian scholars are reluctant to publish in international journals. <b>Lapses</b> in the <b>provision</b> of facilities which should facilitate high quality research are highlighted. It has become compelling on Nigerian universities to provide current state of the art facilities for research in their libraries. This is the first study to determine the degree of acceptance of impact factor as a parameter for appraising academic librarians in Nigeria. It also challenges librarians to publish in impact factor-ranked journals in order to acquire international recognition...|$|R

5000|$|... "On 16 May 2004, the Jatiyo Sangsad (the National Parliament) {{passed the}} 14th {{constitutional}} amendment to reintroduce quotas for women (article 65). The number of seats in parliament is to be raised to 345, 45 (15%) {{of which will be}} reserved for women in the next parliament. The seats will be allocated to parties in proportion to their overall share of the vote. This quota system replaces the previous quota law which expired in 2001. Until 2001 a system of reserved seats for women was used, where 30 seats out of 330 were reserved to women (chosen by indirect election by the 300 directly elected MPs). This provision of guaranteeing women reserved seats expired in April 2001. This quota system was first introduced by the 1972 Constitution (originally providing for 15 reserved seats for women, out of 315 seats, for a period of 10 years). In 1978 a presidential proclamation enlarged the number of reserved seats to 30 and extended the period of reservation to 15 years from the date of promulgation of the constitution of the Republic in December 1972. The constitutional <b>provision</b> <b>lapsed</b> in 1987 and was re-incorporated in the constitution by an amendment in 1990 to be effective for 10 years from the first meeting of the legislature next elected. This <b>provision</b> also <b>lapsed</b> in 2001. The Parliament elected in October 2001 does not have reserved seats for women. Women's groups are lobbying for these seats to become directly elected positions and for the number of reserved seats to be increased." ...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the time <b>lapse</b> prior to <b>provision</b> of emergency dental care and appropriateness of earliest treatment provided {{for children with}} dental trauma. A multi-regional prospective and cross-sectional survey. Paediatric dental departments of Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield. One hundred and fifty referred or emergency paediatric patients with trauma to the permanent incisors. One hundred and fifty subjects were recruited. Mean age of the subjects was 11. 1 years (SD = 2. 6; range = 6. 2 - 16. 6); 100 were male and 50 were female. The mean time interval from injury until initial presentation to a health care professional was 22. 6 hours (SD = 76. 1; range = 0 - 672). Thirty-six percent of children (n = 54) first presented to a general dental practitioner whilst 30 % (n = 45) presented to accident and emergency medical staff. Following initial assessment, a further mean time lapse of 8. 1 hours (SD = 43. 7; range = 0 - 504) was incurred in 25 % of cases prior to dental referral. In 39 % of subjects (n = 58 / 150), treatment was considered inappropriate. The most frequent example of inadequate management was failure to protect exposed dentine, which was found for 71 % (n = 24 / 34) of complicated crown fractures and 40 % (n = 25 / 62) of uncomplicated crown fractures. This study identified marked delays {{in the management of}} some paediatric dental trauma to permanent incisor teeth which, in itself, could be suboptimal. Greater educational and clinical support would seem to be warranted in this area of service provision...|$|R
40|$|D. Cur. Health care professionals, in all settings, {{have become}} {{increasingly}} aware of the consumers' legitimate right to participate in decision-making regarding care to be received. Health professionals have also being criticised for planning and delivering care that {{does not take into}} consideration the client's perceived needs, wishes and expectations of such care. This study is undertaken primarily to explore and describe the expectations of both the care-givers (midwives, student-midwives and doctors) and the health care consumers (mothers and fathers). The focus of the study is the care to be provided to mothers by midwives during labour. It is the aim of the researcher to ameliorate <b>lapses</b> in the <b>provision</b> of comprehensive health care. The study design is exploratory, descriptive, qualitative and contextual in nature. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to formulate guidelines for implementation by the midwife during labour. In order to accomplish this purpose, the research study followed six (6) distinct phases in which different objectives were addressed. In Phase 1, the expectations of mothers and partners/fathers concerning the care to be provided by the midwives during labour were explored. These were described after conducting in-depth qualitative interviews with both the mothers and partners/fathers. In Phase 2, focus group discussions were conducted with the midwives and studentmidwives, to explore and describe their expectations concerning the care to be provided by the midwives during labour. In Phase 3, narratives were gathered from selected doctors, in which they explored and described their expectations concerning the care to be provided to the mothers by midwives during labour. The results of the interviews, focus group discussions and narratives were subsequently analysed based on categories of "Theory for Health Promotion in Nursing (Department of Nursing Science, RAU, 1998) ". The results were also contextualised. A concept analysis was conducted in Phase 4 in order to identify the characteristics of the concept "Caring" using different situations where caring takes place, from literature sources (uses of the concept) as well as the two main themes which emerged from the research results. Thereafter, the identified characteristics of Caring were placed in comparison with the research results obtained from Phase 1, 2 and 3 and were reduced under the following headings: Prerequisites, Process and Consequences. From this process the concept "Caring" was defined. In Phase 5 of the study, a conceptual framework was developed out of all the characteristics determined from the concept analysis and was discussed in three phases namely, the initial, integration and termination. In the final phase, that is Phase 6, the guidelines for operationalising caring during labour were formulated from all the characteristics determined from the concept analysis and the following headings were maintained that is, Prerequisites, Process and Consequences. These guidelines were evaluated and refined by the midwives and student-midwives from the specific hospital where data was collected. The conclusions and trustworthiness of this study were discussed. Recommendations were made in terms of highlighting the possibilities of application of the guidelines for operationalising caring during labour in nursing education, nursing practise and nursing research...|$|R
