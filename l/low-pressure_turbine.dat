5|$|Improvements {{are due to}} its 61-inch {{titanium}} wide chord fan, 3D aerodynamics designed new {{core and}} <b>low-pressure</b> <b>turbine</b> with single crystal high-pressure turbine and Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC). Fan blades are reduced from 38 to 24 and it incorporates features from the CFM56-5 series such as a double-annular combustor as an option.|$|E
5|$|With a {{thrust rating}} of between 31,200 and 34,000lbf (139kN and 151kN), the CFM56-5C series {{is the most}} {{powerful}} of the CFM56 family. It powers Airbus' long-range A340-200 and -300 airliners, and entered service in 1993. The major changes are a larger fan, a fifth <b>low-pressure</b> <b>turbine</b> stage, and the same four-stage low-pressure compressor found in the -5B variant.|$|E
5|$|The work {{split between}} the two {{companies}} gave GE responsibility for the high-pressure compressor (HPC), the combustor, and the high-pressure turbine (HPT); SNECMA {{was responsible for the}} fan, the low-pressure compressor (LPC), and the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>turbine</b> (LPT). SNECMA was also responsible for the initial airframe integration engineering, mostly involving the nacelle design, and was initially responsible for the gearbox, but shifted that work to GE when it became apparent that it would be more efficient for GE to assemble that component along with their other parts.|$|E
50|$|BWR steam {{turbines}} employ a high-pressure turbine {{designed to handle}} saturated steam, and multiple <b>low-pressure</b> <b>turbines.</b> The high-pressure turbine receives steam directly from the reactor. The high-pressure turbine exhaust passes through a steam reheater which superheats the steam to over 400 degrees F for the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>turbines</b> to use. The exhaust of the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>turbines</b> {{is sent to the}} main condenser. The steam reheaters take some of the reactor's steam {{and use it as a}} heating source to reheat what comes out of the high-pressure turbine exhaust. While the reheaters take steam away from the turbine, the net result is that the reheaters improve the thermodynamic efficiency of the plant.|$|R
2500|$|Power station {{furnaces}} {{may have}} a reheater section containing tubes heated by hot flue gases outside the tubes. [...] Exhaust steam from the high-pressure turbine is passed through these heated tubes to collect more energy before driving the intermediate and then <b>low-pressure</b> <b>turbines.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2012, Drax {{power station}} {{completed}} a five-year £100 million project - the largest steam turbine modernisation programme in UK history - upgrading its high-pressure and <b>low-pressure</b> <b>turbines.</b> This saves one million tonnes of CO2 a year, {{which is the}} equivalent of taking 275,000 cars off the road.|$|R
5|$|King George V {{had four}} sets of Parsons geared {{turbines}}. Two main turbines were arranged in series and drove a shaft through double helical gears. An astern turbine was incorporated in the exhaust casing of the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>turbine,</b> and a cruising turbine was coupled directly to the high-pressure turbine. A speed of 28.5 knots was expected at standard displacement and 27.5 knots at full-load displacement on normal output; corresponding speeds at overload condition were 29.25 and 28.25 knots respectively. The turbine unit was a low-speed type (2,257 rpm) coupled to a single reduction gear which produced 236 rpm at the propeller shaft.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, 1987, {{improperly}} assembled bearings in Il-62M engine number 2 on LOT Polish Airlines Flight 5055 overheated {{and exploded}} during cruise over {{the village of}} Lipinki, causing the shaft to break in two; this caused the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>turbine</b> disc to spin to enormous speeds and disintegrate, damaging engine number 1 and cutting the control pushers. The crew managed to return to Warsaw, using nothing but trim tabs to control the crippled aircraft, but on the final approach, the trim controlling links burned and the crew completely lost control over the aircraft. Soon after, it crashed {{on the outskirts of}} Warsaw; all 183 on board perished. Had the plane stayed airborne for 40 seconds more, it {{would have been able to}} reach the runway.|$|E
25|$|The F3 is a two-shaft (or two spool) low-bypass turbofan. It {{features}} a two-stage fan (low-pressure compressor) on the low-pressure shaft, {{followed by a}} five-stage high-pressure compressor on the high-pressure shaft. The engine uses an annular combustor, which feeds a single-stage high-pressure turbine followed by a single-stage <b>low-pressure</b> <b>turbine.</b> The XF3-400 variant includes an afterburner after the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>turbine,</b> the production F3 does not.|$|E
50|$|In {{nuclear power}} plants, boiling water {{reactors}} present unique challenges since the steam {{going through the}} turbines may be radioactive. This means that the turbine hall has to be slightly contained and much unique maintenance must be performed. A typical plant will house one high-pressure <b>turbine</b> and two <b>low-pressure</b> <b>turbines.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{high-pressure}} turbine blades are single-crystal blades, {{and they are}} cooled by a thin film of air from inside of the blades. The <b>low-pressure</b> <b>turbine</b> blades, like the high-pressure compressor, were improved between the F3 and the XF3-400 using 3D CFD.|$|E
25|$|Attempts {{to develop}} and refine OTEC {{technology}} started in the 1880s. In 1881, Jacques Arsene d'Arsonval, a French physicist, proposed tapping the thermal energy of the ocean. D'Arsonval's student, Georges Claude, built the first OTEC plant, in Matanzas, Cuba in 1930. The system generated 22 kW of electricity with a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>turbine.</b> The plant was later destroyed in a storm.|$|E
25|$|The surface {{condenser}} is a {{shell and tube}} heat exchanger in which cooling water is circulated through the tubes. The exhaust steam from the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>turbine</b> enters the shell, where it is cooled and converted to condensate (water) by flowing over the tubes {{as shown in the}} adjacent diagram. Such condensers use steam ejectors or rotary motor-driven exhausts for continuous removal of air and gases from the steam side to maintain vacuum.|$|E

5000|$|Bismarck was {{propelled}} {{by a set}} of quadruple screws driven by four direct drive Parsons turbines. The port centre propeller shaft was driven by a high-pressure turbine, which exhausted to an intermediate pressure turbine that drove the starboard centre shaft. These two turbines were located in the forward watertight compartment. Exhaust from the intermediate turbine was divided equally and fed into two <b>low-pressure</b> <b>turbines</b> on the outer shafts located in a separate compartment aft. The steam turbines generated approximately [...] when running at 180 rpm. Each one of the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>turbines</b> weighed 375 tons. Steam was supplied to the turbines at 260 psi by 48 Yarrow & Normand water-tube boilers located in four watertight compartments. The boilers had a heating surface of [...] and there was a total of 240 oil burners fitted to them. Three funnels were fitted to the vessel but only the forward two were used to carry boiler exhaust. As with many large liners, the third funnel was used to ventilate the engines rooms. Bismarck was originally designed to burn coal but was converted to oil while being completed at Blohm & Voss.|$|R
25|$|Systems may {{be either}} closed-cycle or open-cycle. Closed-cycle OTEC uses working fluids that are {{typically}} {{thought of as}} refrigerants such as ammonia or R-134a. These fluids have low boiling points, and are therefore suitable for powering the system’s generator to generate electricity. The most commonly used heat cycle for OTEC to date is the Rankine cycle, using a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>turbine.</b> Open-cycle engines use vapour from the seawater itself as the working fluid.|$|E
500|$|All {{variants}} of the CFM56 feature a single-stage high-pressure turbine (HPT). In some variants, the HPT blades are [...] "grown" [...] {{from a single}} crystal superalloy, giving them high strength and creep resistance. The <b>low-pressure</b> <b>turbine</b> (LPT) features four stages in most {{variants of}} the engine, but the CFM56-5C has a five-stage LPT. This change was implemented to drive the larger fan on this variant. Improvements to the turbine section were examined during the Tech56 program, and one development was an aerodynamically optimized <b>low-pressure</b> <b>turbine</b> blade design, which would have used 20% fewer blades for the whole <b>low-pressure</b> <b>turbine,</b> saving weight.
