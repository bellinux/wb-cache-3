30|$|Depending {{on various}} mass flux and growth rate, {{the growth of}} 2 D TMCs is divided into four routes (Fig.  3 c). The {{formation}} of nucleus {{and the growth of}} domains depends on mass flux, especially metal precursor, while the grain size is determined by growth rate. High mass flux of metal precursor but <b>low</b> growth <b>rate</b> tends to form polycrystalline film with small grains and lots of grain boundaries (Route I), while high growth rate can produce smoother monolayer film with large grain size and limited grain boundaries (Route II). However, at low mass flux, it prefers to form single-crystalline with small domains at <b>low</b> growth <b>rate</b> (<b>Route</b> III), large monolayer single-crystal at high growth <b>rate</b> (<b>Route</b> IV) [52]. In order to decrease the nucleation density, without changing the amounts of precursors or growth parameters, some additional attempts have been successfully made. For example, NiO foam was used to grow centimeter scale continuous monolayer MoS 2 by trapping chemical precursors [63]. Metal precursors (MoO 3) reacted with NiO and form a Ni–Mo complex, thus the precursor concentration as well as nucleation density decreased. Recently, “liquid-state” substrates show a new possibility to grow large grain size TMDs materials. Because of the low nucleation density together with low migration coefficient, large MoSe 2 and MoS 2 monolayer single-crystals up to ~[*] 2.5  mm successfully deposited on the low-defect and homogeneous molten glass surface [64]. Similarly, another report has further demonstrated that the uniform distribution of Na in soda-lime glass will promote the growth rate of monolayer MoS 2. A face-to-face metal precursor supply route was designed to synthesize 6 -inch uniform monolayer MoS 2 with grain edge length larger than 400  μm. The DFT calculations proved that during the MoS 2 growth, the energy barrier was reduced with Na adsorption [65]. On the other way, due to the different facet-dependent binding energy between Au and MoS 2, it is found that at relative high growth temperatures, large single-crystal domains prefer to grow on Au (100) and Au (110) than on Au (111) facets [66].|$|R

40|$|Abstract — <b>Low</b> <b>rate</b> DoS {{attacks are}} {{emerging}} {{threats to the}} TCP traffic, and the VoIP traffic in the Internet. They are hard to detect as they intelligently send attack traffic inside the network to evade current router based congestion control mechanisms. We propose a practical attack model in which botnets that can pose {{a serious threat to}} the Internet are considered. Under this model, an attacker can scatter bots across the Internet to launch the <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> DoS attack, thus essentially orchestrating the <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> DoS attack that uses random and continuous IP address spoofing, but with valid legitimate IP addresses. It is difficult to detect and mitigate such an attack. We propose a <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> DoS attack detection algorithm, which relies on the core characteristic of the <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> DoS attack in introducing high rate traffic for short periods, and then uses a proactive test based differentiation technique to filter the attack packets. The proactive test was originally proposed to defend DDoS attacks and <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> DoS attacks which tend to ignore the normal operation of network protocols, but it is tailored here to differentiate the legitimate traffic from the <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> DoS attack traffic instigated by botnets. It leverages on the conformity of legitimate flows, which obey the network protocols. It mainly differentiates legitimate connections by checking their responses to the proactive tests which include puzzles for distinguishing botnets from human users. We finally evaluate and demonstrate the performance of the proposed <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> DoS attack detection and mitigation algorithm on the real Internet traces.
