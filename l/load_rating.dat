500|$|Some smaller bridges have {{a weight}} limit (or gross weight <b>load</b> <b>rating)</b> {{indicated}} by a sign posted in a visible position {{in front of}} the bridge (hence the reference to a [...] "posted bridge"). These are necessary when the weight limit of the bridge is lower than the federal or state gross weight limit for trucks. Driving a truck over a bridge that is too weak to support it usually does not result in an immediate collapse. The bridge may develop cracks, which over time can weaken the bridge and cause it to collapse. Most of these cracks are discovered during mandated inspections of bridges. Most bridge collapses occur in rural areas, result in few injuries or deaths, and receive relatively little media attention. While the number varies from year to year, as many as 150 bridges can collapse in a year. About 1,500 bridges collapsed between 1966 and 2007, and most of those were the result of soil erosion around bridge supports. In 1987, the Schoharie Creek Bridge collapsed in upstate New York, due to erosion of soil around the foundation, which sparked renewed interest in bridge design in inspection procedures.|$|E

The M880/M890s had several failings: a gasoline powerplant, 12-volt electrical systems (a separate 24 volt system was added to communications units), and no power steering, due to the PS pump location being used for the 24V generator. The 318 gasoline engine proved to be a fatal flaw as the military moved increasingly to diesel engines during this time period. The lack of power steering was a hindrance in off-road, close quarters, and snow-plowing duties (although most civilian and Air Force models had power steering).

In the 3 N specimen, the dependence of the <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> on the <b>load</b> was slight at <b>loading</b> <b>rates</b> of 0. 7 and 7 mN/s, whereas the load at the <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> of 70 mN/s was higher than the <b>loads</b> at <b>loading</b> <b>rates</b> of 0. 7 and 7 mN/s. On the other hand, the load for the 5 N specimen increased with the increasing <b>loading</b> <b>rate.</b> Thus, the effect of the <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> on the load-displacement curve for the 3 N and 5 N specimens was similar to the strain rate dependence of strength for theses metals. In addition, the micro-indentation test was demonstrated to be strongly affected by high strain <b>rate</b> at a <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> of 70 mN/s...|$|R

The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the dynamic shear failure behavior of RC beams under rapid loading through an experimental study and also to set up a strut-and-tie model with <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> effect to predict the dynamic shear resistance of RC beams. Thus, rapid loading test with 24 RC beams with a shear span-to-deep ratio of 1. 9 was performed, in which shear reinforcement ratio and <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> were variable. All of the RC beams exhibited shear compression failure. Although the shear resistance increases with increasing <b>loading</b> <b>rate,</b> the influence of <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> on the shear resistance clearly depends on shear reinforcement ratio. The strut-and-tie model with <b>loading</b> <b>rate</b> effect was finally developed, in which the thickness of the compression strut was formulated to be increased with an increase in <b>loading</b> <b>rate.</b> The developed strut-and-tie model was good agreement with the experimental results...|$|R
