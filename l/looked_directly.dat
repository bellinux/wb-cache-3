5|$|The next match pitted the Undertaker against Kamala, who was {{accompanied}} by his manager, Harvey Wippleman, and his handler, Kim Chee. Kamala attacked before the match but the Undertaker blocked the attack and punched Kamala repeatedly before performing a chop from the top rope on his opponent. The Undertaker attempted the same move again, but Wippleman knocked the Undertaker off the rope. Kamala knocked the Undertaker outside the ring, where the Undertaker attacked Wippleman and Kim Chee. Back inside the ring, the Undertaker gained the advantage by executing a chokeslam and a clothesline. When the Undertaker attempted his signature move, the Tombstone Piledriver, Kim Chee ran into the ring and hit the Undertaker with a pith helmet. As a result, Kamala was disqualified and the Undertaker won the match. Kamala kept on attacking and hit Undertaker {{with a series of}} splashes and seemingly left his opponent unconscious. When the Undertaker suddenly sat up and <b>looked</b> <b>directly</b> at the Ugandan Giant, Kamala, Whippleman and Kim Chee panicked and fled ringside with The Undertaker and Paul Bearer slowly walking in pursuit.|$|E

Both he and the other agents reported that Dillinger turned his head and <b>looked</b> <b>directly</b> at the agent as he walked by, glanced across the street, then moved ahead of his female companions, reached into his pocket but failed to extract his gun, and ran into a nearby alley. Other accounts stated Dillinger ignored a command to surrender, whipped out his gun, then headed for the alley. Agents already had the alley closed off, but Dillinger was determined to shoot it out.|$|E
500|$|From about 630 BC, Etruscan {{architecture}} {{was heavily}} influenced by Greek architecture, which was itself developing through the same period. [...] In turn it influenced Roman architecture, which in its early centuries {{can be considered as}} just a regional variation of Etruscan architecture. [...] But increasingly, from about 200 BC, the Romans <b>looked</b> <b>directly</b> to Greece for their styling, while sometimes retaining Etruscan shapes and purposes in their buildings.|$|E
500|$|The Transit Telescope was a [...] {{parabolic}} reflector zenith telescope built at Jodrell Bank in 1947. At the time, {{it was the}} largest radio telescope in the world. It consisted of a wire mesh suspended from a ring of [...] scaffold poles, which focussed radio signals to a focal point [...] above the ground. The telescope mainly <b>looked</b> <b>directly</b> upwards, but the direction of the beam could be changed by small amounts by tilting the mast to change the position of the focal point. The focal mast was originally going to be wood, but this was changed to a steel mast before construction was complete. The telescope was replaced by the fully steerable [...] Lovell Telescope, and the Mark II telescope was subsequently built on the same location.|$|E

500|$|The Great Dictator {{spent a year}} in {{production}} and was released in October 1940. The film generated a vast amount of publicity, with a critic for The New York Times calling it [...] "the most eagerly awaited picture of the year", {{and it was one of}} the biggest money-makers of the era. The ending was unpopular, however, and generated controversy. Chaplin concluded the film with a five-minute speech in which he abandoned his barber character, <b>looked</b> <b>directly</b> into the camera, and pleaded against war and fascism. Charles J. Maland has identified this overt preaching as triggering a decline in Chaplin's popularity, and writes, [...] "Henceforth, no movie fan would ever be able to separate the dimension of politics from [...] star image". The Great Dictator received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor.|$|E
500|$|The ending {{sequence}} with Pam and Jim in {{the hospital}} was filmed at the North Hollywood Medical Center using the Sacred Heart Hospital set from Scrubs. Although the good news Jim and Pam learn {{in the hospital}} was never specifically stated, episode writer Jen Celotta confirmed that the news was that Pam was pregnant; the script included an off-hand question from a nurse to Pam about whether she was pregnant so that viewers would make the connection later. Celotta said {{the idea of the}} pregnancy came as the writers were working on this specific episode, although she felt the show had always been heading in that direction. The series producers considered filming the scene with audible dialogue, but they thought the scene was more powerful without audio and felt actors John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer [...] "are such great actors and have the ability to convey so much without hearing their dialogue." [...] Celotta said the show's producers have no plans to release the scene with audio. While filming Jim Halpert's emotional reaction to the pregnancy news, Krasinski and director Ken Kwapis discussed the fact that Jim has been surrounded by this camera crew for the last five years, so he would be glad to share this moment with them. The moment when Jim <b>looked</b> <b>directly</b> at the camera, in particular, was meant to convey the idea that he was celebrating the news with the crew. The script did not call for tears, but Krasinski cried naturally as part of his performance.|$|E
2500|$|Brynner died of {{lung cancer}} on October 10, 1985, in New York City. A few days after his death, the {{recorded}} anti-cigarette public service announcement was shown on all the major US television networks and in many other countries. In it, he expressed his desire to make an anti-smoking commercial after discovering how sick he was, and that his death was imminent. He then <b>looked</b> <b>directly</b> into the camera for 30 seconds and said, [...] "Now that I'm gone, I tell you: Don't smoke. Whatever you do, just don't smoke. If I could take back that smoking, we wouldn't be talking about any cancer. I'm convinced of that." ...|$|E

Together with the Stooges he sang raucous versions of two Madonna hits, [...] "Burning Up" [...] and [...] "Ray of Light." [...] Before leaving the stage he <b>looked</b> <b>directly</b> at Madonna, quoting [...] "You {{make me feel}} shiny and new, like a virgin, touched {{for the very first}} time.", from Madonna's hit song [...] "Like a Virgin". According to guitarist Ron Asheton, Madonna asked the Stooges to perform in her place, as a protest to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for not inducting the Stooges despite six appearances on the nomination ballot. Pop also sang on the [...] "No Fun" [...] cover by Asian Dub Foundation on their 2008 album Punkara.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{not having}} the Republican nomination, Lindsay {{was still on the}} ballot as the {{candidate}} of the New York Liberal Party. In his campaign he said [...] "mistakes were made" [...] and called being mayor of New York City [...] "the second toughest job in America." [...] Two television advertisements described his position: In one he <b>looked</b> <b>directly</b> into the camera and said, [...] "I guessed wrong on the weather before the city's biggest snowfall last winter. And that was a mistake. But I put 6,000 more cops on the streets. And that was no mistake. The school strike went on too long and we all made some mistakes. But I brought 225,000 more jobs to this town. And that was no mistake... And we did not have a Detroit, a Watts or Newark. And those were no mistakes. The things that go wrong are what make this the second toughest job in America. But the things that go right are those things that make me want it." [...] The second opened with a drive through the Holland Tunnel from lower Manhattan toward New Jersey and suggested that, [...] "Every New Yorker should take this trip at least once before election day..." [...] followed by video of Newark, New Jersey which had been devastated by race riots.|$|E
2500|$|More {{and more}} Thérèse {{realised}} {{that she felt}} no attraction to the exalted heights of [...] "great souls". She <b>looked</b> <b>directly</b> for the word of Jesus, which shed light on her prayers and on her daily life. Thérèse's retreat in October 1892 pointed out to her a [...] "downward" [...] path. If asked where she lived, she reflected, must not she {{be able to answer}} with Christ, [...] "The foxes have their lairs, the birds of heaven their nests, but I have no place to rest my head." [...] (Matthew 8:20). She wrote to Céline (letter 19 October 1892), [...] "Jesus raised us above all the fragile things of this world whose image passes away. Like Zacchaeus, we climbed a tree to see Jesus and now let us listen to what he is saying to us. Make haste to descend, I must lodge today at your house. Well, Jesus tells us to descend?" [...] "A question here of the interior," [...] she qualified in her letter, lest Céline think she meant renouncing food or shelter. [...] "Thérèse knew her virtues, even her love, to be flawed, flawed by self, a mirror too clouded to reflect the divine." [...] She continued to seek to discover the means, [...] "to more efficiently strip herself of self." [...] "No doubt, [...] are already empty of creatures, but, alas, I feel mine is not entirely empty of myself, and {{it is for this reason}} that Jesus tells me to descend." ...|$|E
