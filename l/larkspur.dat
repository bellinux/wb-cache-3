5|$|After {{being struck}} from the Naval Vessel Register in October 1941, and a brief, {{unsuccessful}} attempt at merchant service early in World War II, she {{was transferred to}} the War Department for use by the United States Army in November 1942. The ship was selected for employment as a Hague Convention hospital ship and renamed USAHS <b>Larkspur.</b> She made three round trips to the United Kingdom before an extended tour of duty in the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|<b>Larkspur</b> {{conducted}} {{two more}} voyages to England before she sailed for the Mediterranean where she operated for several months, visiting Oran, Algeria; Marseille, France; and Naples, Italy, among other ports. She {{then returned to}} Atlantic waters before being selected for conversion to an Army transport in January 1946. Reclassified as a United States Army Transport (USAT) and resuming operation under her old name, USAT Bridgeport was reconfigured to carry war brides and other military dependents at the Todd Shipyard in Hoboken, New Jersey. She made several voyages between England and the United States in this capacity, operating well into 1947.|$|E
5|$|Savage and {{his second}} wife, Janet, have two children, a {{daughter}} and a son; his son, Russell Weiner, {{is the founder of}} the company that produces the Rockstar energy drink. Russell's mother, Janet, served as CFO of his company until July 2009. Daughter Rebecca Lin Yops has worked as an elementary school teacher.

5|$|Surveyed {{and found}} {{suitable}} for conversion {{to a hospital}} ship, Bridgeport underwent modernization at the Merrill-Stevens Drydock & Repair Co. in Jacksonville, Florida from September 1943 to August 1944, during which time she was renamed USAHS <b>Larkspur.</b> Her maiden voyage as an Army hospital ship took her from Charleston, South Carolina to the British Isles. After visits to the River Clyde and to Belfast, Northern Ireland, she underwent repairs at Newport, Wales, before sailing for home. The ship reached Charleston on 16 October 1944 with her first group of patients.|$|E
5|$|While {{working at}} his bar, Wever made {{a return to}} {{baseball}} in a coaching role. He was named varsity baseball coach at Redwood High School in <b>Larkspur,</b> California in 2008, after having volunteered for the freshman team the year before. He {{was forced to resign}} in 2010 due to a diagnosis of large-cell lymphoma. He went on to continue coaching youth baseball camps and leagues, and was bench coach for the San Rafael Pacifics in 2013. He now spends three days a week feeding the homeless at SF's St. Anthony's Dining Room.|$|E
5|$|Yellow-bellied marmots are diurnal, and {{are less}} active during the night. They are omnivores, but {{generally}} eat {{a wide variety of}} plants, as they are generalist herbivores.They mostly feed on grass, grains, leaves, flowers, legumes, bird eggs, and insects. Occasionally, they are also known to eat fruits and bark of fruit trees. In food choice experiments, yellow-bellied marmots are known to reject plants containing defensive compounds. Due to this, they consume flowers of lupinus, <b>larkspur,</b> and columbine, but avoid their shoots containing toxic compounds. Their food choice depends upon the fatty acid and protein concentrations, which are well present in cinquefoil, cow-parsnip, and leaves of dandelion, which are also present in their diet. In late summer, however, grasses, forbs, and seeds make up most of their diet. They also like to feed on alfalfa and clover. They drink less water, as their plant diet mostly serves their water requirements.|$|E
50|$|In July 2002, county-hired road crews mowing weeds in the {{critical}} habitat area cut down 30 to 50 Baker's <b>larkspurs.</b> Scientists initially believed the action may have caused the species' extinction.|$|R

50|$|Methyllycaconitine (MLA) is a diterpenoid {{alkaloid}} {{found in}} many species of Delphinium (<b>larkspurs).</b> In common with many other diterpenoid alkaloids, it is toxic to animals, although the acute toxicity varies with species. Early research was focused on identifying, and characterizing the properties of methyllycaconitine {{as one of the}} principal toxins in <b>larkspurs</b> responsible for livestock poisoning in the mountain rangelands of North America. Methyllycaconitine has been explored as a possible therapeutic agent for the treatment of spastic paralyses in man, and it has been shown to have insecticidal properties. Most recently, it has become an important molecular probe for studying the pharmacology of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.|$|R
25|$|When the 1914-1918 war ended, {{operative}} work {{started by}} Louis Goaziou recommenced. Headquarters in <b>Larkspur</b> Colorado {{was established in}} 1916. Within a few years, the mortgage of the property was paid off. The administrative building in <b>Larkspur</b> was built between 1921â€“1924 in order to replace the first building, which had become too small. In 1922 the potash mines in Colorado went bankrupt and this led to about 100 Italian members of Le Droit Humain losing their jobs. Despite their real interest for the building of <b>Larkspur,</b> many of these miners felt they had {{no option but to}} leave Masonry. In addition to these departures, an economic downturn have taken hold in North American. It was no longer possible, through lack of funds, to realize the initial project to construct, next door to the administrative offices at <b>Larkspur,</b> an orphanage and a home for the elderly. However Louis Goaziou's hard effort to achieve these goals were not successful. With the coming of the Great Depression, membership went into steep decline, which did not recover until after World War II, in the time of his successor, Edith Armour.|$|E
25|$|The San Rafael Fire Department {{has signed}} {{agreements}} with the fire departments of both the community of Marinwood and the City of <b>Larkspur</b> to pool together their equipment and facilitate the exchange of employees {{to make up for}} any labor shortages at any of the fire departments. <b>Larkspur</b> and San Rafael announced that they intended to merge the administrative structures of both fire departments, though legally, the employees would still be considered employees of the fire department that hired them.|$|E
25|$|Morgan {{later told}} biographer Myra Friedman that, as a non-musician, {{he had felt}} {{excluded}} whenever he had visited Sunset Sound Recorders. Instead, he stayed at Joplin's <b>Larkspur</b> home while she stayed alone at the Landmark, although several times she visited <b>Larkspur</b> {{to be with him}} and to check the progress of renovations she was having done on the house. She told her construction crew to design a carport to be shaped like a flying saucer, according to biographer Ellis Amburn, the concrete foundation for which was poured the day before she died.|$|E
50|$|In botany, a {{follicle}} is a dry unilocular fruit {{formed from}} one carpel, containing {{two or more}} seeds. It is usually defined as dehiscing by a suture in order to release seeds, for example in Consolida (some of the <b>larkspurs),</b> peony and milkweed (Asclepias).|$|R
50|$|On retirement, Clark, {{gave him}} to the British National Stud. He was {{champion}} sire in 1962, thanks to <b>Larkspur's</b> Derby victory. He also sired the Epsom Oaks and 1,000 Guineas winner Never Too Late and other good winners in Die Hard and Sostenuto, stayers who both won the Ebor Handicap.|$|R

25|$|In 1947 Arrowhead {{was sold}} for {{conversion}} to a whale-catcher with a gross register tonnage of 757 tons, emerging in 1948. She was renamed Southern <b>Larkspur.</b> Eventually, the vessel was broken up at Odense, Denmark in December 1959 by H.I. Hansen.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 2006, Redwood art {{students}} created a 40-foot mural of the Marin County countryside. The mural was created on an exterior wall of the cafeteria. The 100th anniversary of <b>Larkspur,</b> 2009, is also the 50th anniversary of Redwood High School.|$|E
25|$|Some of the dyestuffs like indigo or madder were {{goods of}} trade, and thus {{commonly}} available. Yellow or brown dyestuffs more substantially vary from region to region. Many plants provide yellow dyes, like Vine weld, or Dyer's weed (Reseda luteola), Yellow <b>larkspur,</b> or Dyer's sumach Cotinus coggygria. Grape leaves and pomegranate rinds, {{as well as}} other plants, provide different shades of yellow.|$|E
50|$|Bumblebees and {{hummingbirds}} use the nectar {{from the}} flowers. The bee species Bombus nevadensis, Bombus insularis, Bombus appositus and B. flavifrons and the hummingbirds Selasphorus platycercus, S. rufus, and Stellula calliope have been observed. Both types of pollinators prefer the <b>larkspurs</b> {{with the largest}} flower displays. The sphinx moth Hyles lineata and anthomyiid flies also visit the flowers.|$|R
50|$|The {{theater is}} <b>Larkspur's</b> only Art Deco building. It {{originally}} seated 400 people and featured both {{heating and air}} conditioning at the time it opened. Its neon sign and stopped tower are typical details used for 1930s movie theaters. The two small buildings {{on either side of the}} theater were originally used as office and storage space for the theater.|$|R
50|$|Drycry - The {{nickname}} of {{the manager}} of the local Co-op store, Mr. McKelvie. McKelvie owns several of <b>Larkspur's</b> major supply businesses and is the town's leading employer. Don gave him the name after noticing his voice always sounds like he is crying, but he never sees any tears. Drycry is clearly the most untrustworthy character in the series and is always trying to take advantage of Walt.|$|R
25|$|When Joplin {{returned}} to the United States, she began using heroin again. Her relationship with Niehaus soon ended because he witnessed her shooting drugs at her new home in <b>Larkspur,</b> California. The relationship was also complicated by her ongoing romantic relationship with Peggy Caserta, who also was an intravenous addict, and Joplin's refusal {{to take some time}} off and travel the world with him.|$|E
25|$|On April 11, 1994, The American Federation of Human Rights formed under {{members of}} the Sovereign Grand Inspector General(S.G.I.G.) of the Thirty-third Degree and founded The Honorable Order of American Co-Masonry. Also known as American Co-Masonry, this now-independent obedience, which has its {{headquarters}} in <b>Larkspur,</b> Colorado, has since become a Co-Masonic organization in the United States and has established Lodges in Brazil, Chile, and Argentina.|$|E
25|$|Plant {{communities}} {{range from}} low-elevation grasslands and ponderosa pine forest to alpine meadows. Engelmann spruce, mountain hemlock, subalpine fir and whitebark pine {{can be found}} in the higher elevations, with Douglas-fir, white fir, western larch, and lodgepole pine elsewhere. Wildflowers include clarkia, Indian paintbrush, sego lily, elephanthead, <b>larkspur,</b> shooting star, and bluebell. Rocky bluffs in the Hells Canyon area support prickly pear cactus and poison ivy.|$|E
60|$|Kitty {{rose and}} dressed herself, {{and sat at}} the window, and watched the morning come into the garden below: first, a tremulous flush of the heavens; then a rosy light on the silvery roofs and gables; then little golden aisles among the lilacs and hollyhocks. The tiny flower-beds just under her window were left, with their snap-dragons and <b>larkspurs,</b> in dew and shadow; the small dog stood on the threshold, and barked uneasily when the bell rang in the Ursulines' Chapel, where the nuns were at matins.|$|R
60|$|In {{the middle}} of her white drawing-room, whose {{latticed}} window ran the whole length of one wall, stood a little table on which was a silver jar full of early <b>larkspurs,</b> evidently from her garden by the river. And Lennan waited, his eyes fixed on those blossoms so like to little blue butterflies and strange-hued crickets, tethered to the pale green stems. In this room she passed her days, guarded from him. Once a week, at most, {{he would be able to}} come there--once a week for an hour or two of the hundred and sixty-eight hours that he longed to be with her.|$|R
5000|$|Sugarloaf Ridge State Parkâ€™s forests {{consist of}} Douglas firs, big-leaf maple, madrone, coastal redwoods, California buckeye and alder trees {{as well as}} an {{abundance}} of oaks including live, laurel, and mixed oaks. Poison oak and stinging nettles are found along the Sonoma Creek and can be a threat to hikers. Shrubs of the chaparral include manzanita, chamise, California lilac, coyote bush, toyon, and winebush. Sugarloaf experiences a colorful spring with a wide array of wildflowers California poppies, cream cups, lupines, penstemons, buttercups, peas, shooting stars, trilliums, Indian warriors and mariposa lily. Golden fairy lantern, zigadene, and fritillarias are in certain regions of the enclosure as well. [...] Summer boasts the blossoming of even more flowers including clarkias, scarlet <b>larkspurs,</b> farewell-to-springs, Mariposa lilies, monkey flowers, and Indian pinks and yellow star thistles and tarweeds. [...] At least 400 plants species are found in Sugarloaf Ridge State Park.|$|R
25|$|Joplin {{checked into}} the Landmark Motor Hotel in Hollywood on August 24, 1970, near Sunset Sound Recorders, where she began rehearsing and {{recording}} her album. During the sessions, Joplin continued a relationship with Seth Morgan, a 21-year-old UC Berkeley student, cocaine dealer, and future novelist who had visited her new home in <b>Larkspur</b> in July and August. She and Morgan were {{engaged to be married}} in early September, even though he visited Sunset Sound Recorders for just eight of Joplin's many rehearsals and sessions.|$|E
25|$|In 1911 {{the family}} moved from Oregon to <b>Larkspur</b> in Marin County, California. In 1915 Kanaga {{got a job as}} a reporter, feature writer and {{part-time}} photographer for the San Francisco Chronicle. Dorothea Lange later said that Kanaga was the first female newspaper photographer she had ever encountered. It was there that she discovered Alfred Stieglitz's journal Camera Work and decided to become a photographer. Lange encouraged her to take up photography as a career and introduced her to the growing San Francisco Bay Area community of artistic photographers, notably Anne Brigman, Edward Weston, Francis BruguiÃ¨re, and Louise Dahl-Wolf.|$|E
25|$|This French {{speaking}} Lodge {{continued until}} 1973. Six other Lodges were founded in 1904, three working in French, one in Slav, one in Italian {{and one in}} English (under the direction of John Goaziou, a brother of Louis). Soon Lodges were founded in Chicago, St. Louis and in California. The Rose-Croix degrees were given to Louis Goaziou by communication in November, 1904 (please note, Goaziou's Grand Lodge Eternal record in <b>Larkspur,</b> CO, indicates he received this degree from Muzzarelli September 1, 1905) and he {{became a member of}} Chapter Nr.1 in the valley of Paris. The first American Chapter (Nr.?) was formed in Charleroi with six charter members.|$|E
6000|$|I {{confess that}} gardens {{in most cases}} affect me disagreeably; hence I avoid them, and think and know little about garden flowers. It is of course {{impossible}} not to go into gardens. The large garden is the greatly valued annexe of the large house, and is {{as much or more}} to the mistress than the coverts to the master; and when I am asked to go into the garden to see and admire all that is there, I cannot say, [...] "Madam, I hate gardens." [...] On the contrary, I must weakly comply and pretend to be pleased. And when going the rounds of her paradise my eyes light by chance on a bed of tulips, or scarlet geraniums, or blue <b>larkspurs,</b> or detested calceolarias or cinerarias--a great patch of coloured flame springing out of a square or round bed of grassless, brown, desolate earth--the effect is more than disagreeable: the mass of colour glares at and takes possession of me, and spreads itself over and blots out a hundred delicate and prized images of things seen that existed in the mind.|$|R
60|$|And it did. North {{dispatched}} a second letter to Maria {{saying that he}} had already made other arrangements for the baby. Pleased with her easy victory, Miss Bessy became more than usually gracious, and the next day bowed her shapely neck meekly to the yoke of her teacher, and became a docile pupil. James North could not have helped noticing her ready intelligence, even had he been less prejudiced in her favor than he was fast becoming now. If he had found it pleasant before to be admonished by her there was still more delicious flattery in her perfect trust in his omniscient skill as a pilot over this unknown sea. There was a certain enjoyment in guiding her hand over the writing-book, that I fear he could not have obtained from an intellect less graciously sustained by its physical nature. The weeks flew quickly by on gossamer wings, and when she placed a bunch of <b>larkspurs</b> and poppies in his hand one morning, he remembered for the first that it was spring.|$|R
60|$|He {{finds in}} June, at Blackdown, the blaze {{of the yellow}} azalea-bush, or in another spot the strong pink of the rhododendron, beneath the silver firs that deepen {{the blue of the}} sky. He finds the Vicarage Walk, at King's Langley, a smother of old-fashioned flowers--a midsummer vista for the figures of a happy lady and a lucky dog. He finds the delicious huddle of the gabled, pigeon-haunted roof of a certain brown old {{building}} at Frame, with poppies and gladiolus and hollyhock crowding the beautiful foreground. He finds--apparently in the same place--the tangle of the hardy flowers that come while the roses are still in bloom, with the tall blue <b>larkspurs</b> standing high among them. He finds the lilies, white and red, at Broadway, and the poppies, which have dropped most of their petals--apparently to let the roses, which are just coming out, give their grand party. Their humility is rewarded by the artist's admirable touch in the little bare poppy-heads that nod on their flexible pins.|$|R
