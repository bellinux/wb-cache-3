Petrol prices were raised by 75% from 4,000 to 7,000 rials ($0.16 to $0.28) per <b>litre,</b> which is far from the target price of approx. $0.90 per <b>litre.</b> As a consequence, fuel smuggling and gasoline imports increased again.|$|E
5|$|In September 2007, the 2008 NZETS was {{expected}} to increase the GST-inclusive retail price of petrol by 3.7 cents a <b>litre</b> (2.5%) under a $15 carbon price scenario and 6.1 cents (4%) under a $25 scenario. The Labour Government predicted that the NZETS may cause petrol prices to rise by about 4 cents a <b>litre.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between 1 July 2010 and February 2015, the {{estimated}} NZETS {{component of the}} retail petrol price has ranged from a maximum of 2.4 cents per <b>litre</b> from late 2010 to June 2011 to a minimum of half a cent from July 2013 to December 2014.|$|E

The front passenger seat can also optionally fold fully forward, creating a load space which is up to 2,484 mm long.|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, work was {{commissioned}} to precisely determine {{the mass of}} a cubic decimetre (one <b>litre)</b> of water. Although the decreed definition of the kilogram specified water at 0°C—its highly stable temperature point—the French chemist Louis Lefèvre-Gineau and the Italian naturalist Giovanni Fabbroni {{after several years of}} research chose to redefine the standard in 1799 to water's most stable density point: the temperature at which water reaches maximum density, which was measured at the time as 4°C.|$|E
5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{supplied}} by a separate 1,074 <b>litre</b> (276 US Gallon, 230 Imperial Gallon) fuel tank using dual booster pumps. Optional {{fourth and fifth}} tanks {{can be added to}} act as a reservoir supply, topping up the main tanks during flight, increasing range or endurance. The AW101 can also be outfitted with a probe for aerial refuelling. Self-sealing fuel tanks are an optional item to be selected by the customer. An inlet particle separator system can be installed, protecting the engine when operating in sandy environments.|$|E
5|$|For 1966 the Formula One engine {{capacity}} limit was increased to 3.0 litres from the 1.5 litres {{of the previous}} five seasons. McLaren considered and discounted British Racing Motors (BRM), Maserati, Coventry Climax and Oldsmobile engines before opting for a Ford V8 engine. This engine was originally designed for the Indianapolis 500, the premier single-seater oval track race in the United States, {{and had to be}} reduced in capacity from 4.2 litres to the 3.0 <b>litre</b> limit. This choice was partly motivated by the belief that it might bring financial support from Ford, although this never materialised. Ex BMW and Daimler-Benz engineer Klaus von Rucker was initially appointed to carry out the conversion of the engine in England. However, progress was slow so the project was transferred to Traco Engineering in California, United States, where extensive modifications were made to the internals under the oversight of McLaren's Gary Knutson. In its 4.2 <b>litre</b> form the Ford engine produced 470bhp and McLaren expected the reduced capacity version to produce about 335bhp. In fact, it produced 300bhp in a narrow power band and was further handicapped by its large size and weight; combined with the gearbox it weighed nearly as much as rival team Brabham's entire car. In order to allow time to further develop the Ford, McLaren also used a Serenissima M166 3.0 <b>litre</b> V8 engine for some of the races. This engine produced about 260bhp and required modifications to be made to the monocoque but was at least relatively light and compact. Four- and five-speed ZF transaxle gearboxes and a Borg & Beck clutch were employed.|$|E

The increased length yields an extra 150 <b>litres</b> of boot capacity, taking the total to 528 <b>litres.</b> With the rear seats folded, the total cargo capacity is 1642 <b>litres,</b> {{an increase of}} 326 <b>litres</b> over the hatch.|$|R
5|$|In Chinese, Japanese, and Korean {{language}} computing (CJK), some of {{the commonly}} used units, prefix–unit combinations, or unit–exponent combinations have been allocated predefined single characters taking up a full square. Unicode includes these in its CJK Compatibility and letter-like symbols sub-ranges for back compatibility, without necessarily recommending future usage. These are summarised in Unicode symbols. The cursive ℓ, a letter-like symbol, {{has been used in}} a number of countries in addition to China and Japan as a symbol for the <b>litre,</b> but this is not currently recommended by any standards body.|$|E
5|$|In {{temperate}} climates {{there is}} a sudden movement of sap {{at the end of}} the winter as trees prepare to burst into growth. In North America, the sap of the sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is most often used in the production of a sweet liquid, maple syrup. About 90% of the sap is water, the remaining 10% being a mixture of various sugars and certain minerals. The sap is harvested by drilling holes in the trunks of the trees and collecting the liquid that flows out of the inserted spigots. It is piped to a sugarhouse where it is heated to concentrate it and improve its flavour. One <b>litre</b> of maple syrup is obtained from every forty litres of sap and has a sugar content of exactly 66%. Similarly in northern Europe the spring rise in the sap of the silver birch (Betula pendula) is tapped and collected, either to be drunk fresh or fermented into an alcoholic drink. In Alaska, the sap of the sweet birch (Betula lenta) is made into a syrup with a sugar content of 67%. Sweet birch sap is more dilute than maple sap; a hundred litres are required to make one <b>litre</b> of birch syrup.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} Bond stories Fleming gave Bond a battleship-grey Bentley 4½ <b>Litre</b> with an Amherst Villiers supercharger. After Bond's car was written off by Hugo Drax in Moonraker, Fleming gave Bond a Mark II Continental Bentley, {{which he used}} in the {{remaining}} books of the series. During Goldfinger, Bond was issued with an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device, which he used to track Goldfinger across France. Bond returned to his Bentley for the subsequent novels.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} {{coherence}} was only {{introduced into the}} metric system {{in the third quarter}} of the 19th century; in its original form the metric system was non-coherent—in particular the <b>litre</b> was 0.001m3 and the are (from which the hectare derives) was 100m2. However the units of mass and length were related to each other through the physical properties of water, the gram having been designed as being the mass of one cubic centimetre of water at its freezing point.|$|E
5|$|This system {{continued}} {{the tradition of}} having separate base units for geometrically related dimensions, e.g., mètre for lengths, are (100m2) for areas, stère (1m3) for dry capacities, and <b>litre</b> (1 dm3) for liquid capacities. The hectare, equal to a hundred ares, the area of a square 100 metres on a side (about 2.47 acres), is still in use. The early metric system included only a few prefixes from milli (one thousandth) to myria (ten thousand).|$|E
5|$|A unique form of {{circulating}} specie is {{the fuel}} ration coupon, {{which has been}} issued in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. Known denominations include 1, 5, 10, 20, 25, & 50 litres of petrol (gasoline), kerosene and/or diesel, and translate roughly into the local petrol price (about 1 UK pound sterling per <b>litre</b> or US$1.50 in late 2008). Businesses, including Western Union, have been reported paying employees with these coupons, and even auctions have been transacted in this currency. As with much Zimbabwe currency, printing standards are crude and counterfeiting is rampant; the RBZ has been dissuading this widespread use.|$|E
50|$|According to the University of Ferrara, who {{conducted}} tests on Indurain, his strength {{came from his}} body's superior physiology.

5|$|John Boscawen of the Act Party {{commented that}} the NZ ETS was a grand experiment, without {{precedent}} in any other nation in the world. Boscawen was critical of {{the effect that the}} ETS will have on households and farmers, stating that the average power bill will rise 10%, fuel bills will rise by 7 cents per <b>litre</b> and dairy farms will face an increase in costs before agriculture enters the scheme of NZ$7,500 per year as a result of associated increases in fuel, electricity and the cost of processing milk products. Boscawen called for the NZ ETS to be scrapped or delayed indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Monocytes {{develop in}} the bone marrow and reach {{maturity}} in the blood. Mature monocytes have large, smooth, lobed nuclei and abundant cytoplasm that contains granules. Monocytes ingest foreign or dangerous substances and present antigens to other cells of the immune system. Monocytes form two groups: a circulating group and a marginal group that remain in other tissues (approximately 70% are in the marginal group). Most monocytes leave the blood stream after 20–40 hours to travel to tissues and organs {{and in doing so}} transform into macrophages or dendritic cells depending on the signals they receive.
