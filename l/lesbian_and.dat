40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{compared}} {{the prevalence of}} cigarette smoking and alcohol use among <b>lesbians</b> <b>and</b> bisexual women with that among heterosexual women. METHODS: Logistic regression models were created with data from an extensive member health survey at a large health maintenance organization. Sexual orientation was the primary predictor, and alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking were outcomes. RESULTS: <b>Lesbians</b> <b>and</b> bisexual women younger than 50 years {{were more likely than}} heterosexual women to smoke cigarettes <b>and</b> drink heavily. <b>Lesbians</b> <b>and</b> bisexual women aged 20 to 34 reported higher weekly alcohol consumption and less abstinence compared with heterosexual women <b>and</b> older <b>lesbians</b> <b>and</b> bisexual women.

5|$|According to {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by the Williams Institute, nine million Americans, or roughly 3.4% of the adult population identify themselves as homosexual, bisexual, or transgender. A 2016 Gallup poll also concluded that 4.1% of adult Americans identified as LGBT. The highest percentage came from the District of Columbia (10%), while the lowest state was North Dakota at 1.7%. In a 2013 survey, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 96.6% of Americans identify as straight, while 1.6% identify as gay or <b>lesbian,</b> <b>and</b> 0.7% identify as being bisexual.|$|E

A total of 292 participants, aged between 18 and 27 (M = 21) responded to a questionnaire measuring attitudes toward parenting by gay men <b>and</b> <b>lesbians,</b> gay <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> rights, <b>and</b> beliefs about the etiology of homosexuality. Results revealed that the majority of students were against gay <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> parenting, gay <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> equal rights, <b>and</b> believed that homosexuality has a social/environmental basis. It was found that sexual prejudice is highly prevalent in Portuguese university students, and implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
5|$|In Hall's time, Paris {{was known}} for having a {{relatively}} large and visible gay and lesbian community– in part because France, unlike England, had no laws against male homosexuality. Marcel Proust's novels continued in their influence upon 1920s Parisian society depicting <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay subculture. When Stephen first travels to Paris, {{at the urging of}} her friend Jonathan Brockett– who may be based on Noël Coward– she has not yet spoken about her inversion to anyone. Brockett, acting as tour guide, hints at a secret history of inversion in the city by referring to Marie Antoinette's rumoured relationship with the Princesse de Lamballe.|$|E

5|$|Some {{women were}} able {{to arrive at the}} {{recruiting}} station in a man's suit, deny ever having been in love with another woman, and be easily inducted. Sexual activity, however, was forbidden, and blue discharge was almost certain if one identified oneself as a lesbian. As women found each other, they formed into tight groups on base, socialized at service clubs, and began to use code words. Historian Allan Bérubé documented that homosexuals in the armed forces either consciously or subconsciously refused to identify themselves as homosexual or <b>lesbian,</b> <b>and</b> also never spoke about others' orientation.|$|E

5|$|Although {{homosexuality}} among females {{has taken}} place in many cultures in history, a recent phenomenon is the development of family among same-sex partners. Before the 1970s, the idea that same-sex adults formed long-term committed relationships was unknown to many people. The majority of lesbians (between 60% and 80%) report being in a long-term relationship. Sociologists credit the high number of paired women to gender role socialization: the inclination for women to commit to relationships doubles in a lesbian union. Unlike heterosexual relationships that tend to divide work based on sex roles, lesbian relationships divide chores evenly between both members. Studies have also reported that emotional bonds are closer in <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay relationships than heterosexual ones.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} and depression {{are the most}} common mental health issues for women. Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women, although generalized anxiety disorder is more likely to appear among <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> bisexual women than heterosexual women. Depression is a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide their sexual orientation from friends and family, or experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or endure relationship difficulties with no support system. Men's shaping of women's sexuality has proven to have an effect on how lesbians see their own bodies. Studies have shown that heterosexual men and lesbians have different standards for what they consider attractive in women. Lesbians who view themselves with male standards of female beauty may experience lower self-esteem, eating disorders, and higher incidence of depression. More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had suicidal thoughts, and 18% had attempted suicide.|$|E

He seeks the legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as non-toxic but is still not approved. The judge is compassionate toward him and admonishes the FDA, but lacks the legal tools to do anything. As the film ends, on-screen text reveals that the FDA later allowed Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use and that he died of AIDS in 1992, seven years later than his doctors initially predicted.|$|E

5|$|Feminist {{views on}} {{sexuality}} vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality {{have taken a}} few different directions. Matters such as the sex industry, sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in {{what came to be}} known as the feminist sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism, and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates. Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the sexual revolution from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> bisexual women as part of feminism.|$|E

When the issue of affirmative action for gay <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> people is raised at all, it is almost always mentioned as a feared result of enacting antidiscrimination laws, is occasionally cited briefly in a footnote, or is simply presented alongside affirmative action for racial minorities and women, without any attention drawn to the novel issues raised by the sexual orientation component of such affirmative action. Even the National Gay <b>and</b> <b>Lesbian</b> Task Force, a leading gay <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> civil rights <b>and</b> public education organization, has no position on affirmative action for <b>lesbians</b> <b>and</b> gay men. Perhaps proponents of affirmative action simply do not welcome the additional controversy that would likely accompany inclusion of <b>lesbians</b> <b>and</b> gay men; perhaps gay <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> community leaders fear alienating potential supporters by appearing to demand 2 ̆ 2 special rights 2 ̆ 2 or preferential treatment over heterosexual workers; perhaps employers, affirmative action supporters, and society at large are still too homophobic even to broach the subject of affirmative action for <b>lesbians</b> <b>and</b> gay men...|$|R
5|$|Michael Moorcock {{was one of}} {{the first}} scifi authors to depict {{positive}} portrayals of homosexual, <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> bisexual relationships and sex in his novels. For example, in his 1965 novel, The Final Programme, most of the leading characters, including the central 'hero' Jerry Cornelius, engage in same sex relationships on multiple occasions and same sex relationships are depicted as entirely normal and without any moralising, negative consequences or gratuitous titillation, this is the case in the whole Jerry Cornelius series and in Moorcock's fiction generally (particularly in the Dancers at the End of Time series) sexuality is seen as polymorphic and fluid rather than based in fixed identities and gender roles.|$|E
