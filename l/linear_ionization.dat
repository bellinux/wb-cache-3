It is capable to cool transverse emittance of a beam from 2 - 3 mm to 0. 5 mm at the channel length of about 130 m.

40|$|An {{investigation}} into wave interactions between self-excited ionization waves - striations - in the positive column {{of a direct}} current argon discharge is described. Since such self-excited ionization waves {{are determined by the}} ionization processes in the discharge, they are inherently nonlinear and a variety of nonlinear effects may be observed. After reviewing the theory and experimental observations for small amplitude <b>linear</b> <b>ionization</b> waves in gas discharges, experimental data obtained from an argon discharge, 5 cm in diameter, 110 cms in length, run at gas pressures between 0. 1 - 1. 5 torr and discharge currents of 20 - 250 mA, are presented. Linear interactions between large amplitude self-excited waves of the same frequency, and nonlinear mode coupling between waves of different frequencies and wave numbers are reported and the characteristics of each wave type are described. In order to interpret some of the phenomena observed for the self-excited waves, experiments where an external alternating voltage was applied across the discharge were performed. Following a general discussion of wave modulation the wave-wave mode coupling is interpreted as due to nonlinear interactions which may arise during the initial nonlinear growth of ionization waves. A physical model for the nonlinear behaviour is described. By including a nonlinear term in the basic theory of striations expressions are derived which account for the mode-coupling and support the physical interpretation. - 2 -Theoretical techniques previously used to describe the nonlinear behaviour of water waves are outlined, and then applied to ionization waves to predict further nonlinear effects which could not be obtained from the modified linear theory. Finally, a general overall view of two-wave interactions between ionization waves in a discharge is presented using, as an example, the results from a neon discharge. The experimental observations are related to the linear and nonlinear growth of the waves. <p...|$|E
40|$|The {{transient}} ICP-MS {{intensity of}} a particle {{depends on the}} rates of particle vaporization and ionization and diffusion of the analyte atoms in the ICP. In this study, a mathematical model has been developed to investigate the relative contribution of these three processes on the relative ICP-MS intensity along the ICP central channel. Gold nanoparticles were used as the model particles. The input parameters of the computer model are optimized by comparing the calculated depth profiles of ICP-MS intensity of the model particles to the experimental profiles. The computer model previously developed in this research group has been updated in this study. The rates of vaporization of the model particles in the ICP by both heat-transfer-limited and mass-transfer-limited vaporization mechanisms are compared for each time step. The slower process {{is used to calculate}} the number of gold atoms vaporized in that time step. The degree of ionization of the vaporized gold atoms is then calculated using Saha equation. The ionization temperature was determined experimentally by comparing the intensity ratio of Cd and I. The profile of ionization temperature is sigmoidal and gives more accurate estimation of the ICP-MS intensity than the hypothetical <b>linear</b> <b>ionization</b> temperature profile used in the previous study. The vaporized atoms diffused rapidly to form a plume. The number of ions in the ion plume that passes through the sampler cone is calculated as the ICP-MS intensity. The effect of gas dynamics is taken into consideration by introducing a new parameter of effective aperture of the sampler cone. The previous model suffers from underestimation of the number of ions sampled by using the physical diameter of the sampler cone in ion sampling calculation. With the improvements on the ionization and diffusion calculation, the shape and relative sensitivity of the simulated depth profiles of ICP-MS intensity of the model gold nanoparticles agree with the experimental results. Vaporization and ionization are the main processes in the computer model that determine the ion production rate. The limiting process for the smaller particles is ionization while that for the larger particles is vaporization. The ionization-limiting process gives the linear calibration curves. The depth profiles of ICP-MS intensity for the particles and standard solutions are also identical and the sensitivity ratio of solution to particles is constant along the sampling depth for the smaller particles. The particle diameter at which the limiting process changes from ionization-limiting to vaporization-limiting is the transition diameter. The calibration curves roll off for particle diameter larger than the transition diameter. The linear dynamic range of the calibration curves, or the transition diameter, is dependent on molecular weight, density, ionization potential, and boiling point of the particles. The transition diameter also depends on the ICP forward power and carrier gas flow rate. High gas flow rate and low power are preferred for larger linear dynamic range. Particles within the linear dynamic range can be calibrated using standard solution with the sensitivity ratio between solution and particle corrected. published_or_final_versionChemistryDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

However, new measurements of the established methods allow deeper insight into the dose distributions and reasons for possible deviations from uniform dose. Materials and methodsThe TSEI technique applied at Heidelberg University Hospital since 1992 consists of irradiating the patient with a superposition of two beams of low energy electrons at gantry angles of 72 ° and 108 ° while he is rotating in a standing position on a turntable at 370 cm distance from the accelerator.

An approach based on collision-induced dissociation (CID) MSⁿ spectra acquired by electrospray <b>ionization</b> <b>linear</b> ion trap time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-LIT-TOFMS) in the positive- and negative-ion modes {{has been proposed}} as a direct method of assigning N-glycans without releasing them from N-glycopeptides. In the positive-ion mode of this approach, the MS² spectrum of N-glycopeptide was acquired so that a glycoside-bond cleavage occurs in the chitobiose residue (i. e., GlcNAcβ 1 - 4 GlcNAc, GlcNAc: N-acetylglucosamine) attached to asparagine (N), and two charges on the [M+H+Na]²+ precursor ion are shared with both of the resulting fragments. These fragments are sodiated Bn-type fragment ions of oligosaccharide (N-glycan) and a protonated peptide ion retaining one GlcNAc residue on the asparagine (N) residue. The structure of N-glycan was assigned by comparing MS³ spectra derived from both the sodiated Bn-type fragment ions of N-glycopeptide and the PA (2 -aminopyridine) N-glycan standard (i. e., MSⁿ spectral matching). In a similar manner, the structural assignment of sialylated N-glycan was performed by employing the negative-ion CID MSⁿ spectra of deprotonated Bn-type fragment ions of N-glycopeptide and the PA N-glycan standard. The efficacy of this approach was tested with chicken egg yolk glycopeptides with a neutral and a sialylated N-glycan, and human serum IgG glycopeptides with neutral N-glycan isomers.

Using both calculation algorithms, different configuration of symmetric and asymmetric fields varying the wedge’s angle were tested. Accuracy of the treatment planning system was evaluated in terms of percentage differences between measured and calculated values for wedge factors, depth doses, and profiles. As far as the absolute dose distribution was concerned, the gamma index method (Low et al. (13)) was used with 3 % and 3 mm as acceptance criteria for dose difference and distance-to-agreement, respectively. Wedge factors and percentage depth doses were within 1 % deviation between calculated and measured values. The comparison of measured and calculated dose profiles shows that the Van Dyk’s acceptance criteria (Van Dyk et al.

Several characteristic differences were observed between the positive- and negative-ion CID MSn (n = 2, 3) spectra. In the positive-ion MS 2 spectra, the peptide moiety was presumably stable, but the neutral N-glycan moiety caused several B-type fragmentations and the sialylated N-glycan almost lost sialic acid(s). In contrast, in the negative-ion MS 2 spectra, the peptide moiety caused several side-chain and N-glycan residue (e. g., N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue) fragmentations {{in addition to}} backbone cleavages, but the N-glycan moieties were relatively stable. The positive-ion MS 3 spectra derived from the protonated peptide ion containing a GlcNAc residue (203. 1 Da) provided enough information to determine the peptide amino-acid sequence including the glycosylation site, while the negative-ion MS 3 spectra derived from the deprotonated peptide containing a 0, 2 X 1 -type cross-ring cleavage (83. 1 Da) complicated the peptide sequence analysis due to side-chain and 0, 2 X 1 residue related fragmentations. However, for the structural information of the N-glycan moiety of the glycopeptides, the negative-ion CID MS 3 spectra derived from the deprotonated 2, 4 A 6 -type cross-ring cleavage ion (neutral N-glycan) or the doubly deprotonated B 6 -type fragment ion (sialylated N-glycan) are more informative than {{are those of the}} corresponding positive-ion CID MS 3 spectra.

Specifically, we exposed C 57 BL/ 6 J mice to 0. 1, 0. 25 and 1. 0 Gy whole body 16 O (600 MeV/n) irradiation and examined the effects on peripheral blood (PB) cells, and bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) at {{two weeks after the}} exposure. The results showed that the numbers of white blood cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils and platelets were significantly decreased in PB after exposure to 1. 0 Gy, but not to 0. 1 or 0. 25 Gy. However, both the frequency and number of HPCs and HSCs were reduced in a radiation dose-dependent manner in comparison to un-irradiated controls. Furthermore, HPCs and HSCs from irradiated mice exhibited a significant reduction in clonogenic function determined by the colony-forming and cobblestone area-forming cell assays. These acute adverse effects of 16 O irradiation on HSCs coincided with an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), enhanced cell cycle entry of quiescent HSCs, and increased DNA damage. However, none of the 16 O exposures induced apoptosis in HSCs. These data suggest that exposure to low doses of 16 O irradiation induces acute BM injury in a dose-dependent manner primarily via increasing ROS production, cell cycling, and DNA damage in HSCs. This finding may aid in developing novel strategies in the protection of the hematopoietic system from space radiation...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundModern medical accelerators {{are usually}} {{equipped}} with a dynamic wedge option. It {{is a form of}} dose-rate modulation which makes use of the dynamic movement pairs of collimator jaws. Dynamic wedges may replace physical wedges but their use requires more complex dosimetry and quality control procedures. Film dosimetry has been proposed as a quality control tool in dynamic dose distribution. We present examples of extensive systematic calculation errors which were detected during complex dosimetry quality control procedures in two treatment planning systems. AimThe aim, in presenting QA procedures and examples of systematic errors which were detected and corrected, is to focus attention on the QA of dynamic accessories used in TPS before they are used in the clinical practice. This is an important issue which may have been frequently overlooked as the configuration of dynamic wedges in many treatment planning systems requires no dose measurement data. Measurements of verifications are often, overlooked. Materials/MethodsDynamic wedge dose distributions were generated by Clinac 2300 C/D accelerators (Varian) for beam energies of 6 and 15 MV. Measurements were performed with LA 48 <b>linear</b> array of <b>ionization</b> chambers (PTW), and with dosimetric films X-Omat V and EDR- 2 (Kodak). The dosimetric characteristics of the film were examined {{for a wide range of}} dose values and beam parameters. The results of the measurements were compared with dose distribution calculations produced by the treatment planning systems Helax and CadPlan/Eclipse. ResultsThe initial results showed considerable differences between measurements and calculations. Larger differences were observed for larger wedge angles and lower energies. On the basis of these results, TPS manufacturers were able to tune their calculation algorithms which effectively reduced the observed differences from a level of − 5. 5 % and − 8 % (for 15 and 6 MV respectively) for 60 ° wedges to a level of ± 2 % for the Helax system. ConclusionsA comprehensive quality control procedure for a broad range of dynamic wedge parameters, on a Clinac 2300 C/D, made it possible to achieve an improved agreement between measured and calculated results in radiotherapy. Such measurement procedures should be included in the recommendations for periodic quality control tests of accelerators...|$|R
40|$|CONSPECTUS: Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs), consisting of laterally fused benzene rings, {{are among the}} most widely studied small-molecule organic semiconductors, with potential applications in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Linear acenes, including tetracene, pentacene, and their derivatives, have received particular attention due to the synthetic flexibility in tuning their chemical structure and properties and to their high device performance. Unfortunately, longer acenes, which could exhibit even better performance, are susceptible to oxidation, photo-degradation, and, in solar cells which contain fullerenes, Die Is Alder reactions. This Account highlights recent advances in the molecular design of two-dimensional (2 -D) PAHs that combine device performance with environmental stability. New synthetic techniques have been developed to create stable PAHs that extend conjugation in two dimensions. The stability of these novel compounds is consistent with Claes sextet rule as the 2 -D PAHs have greater numbers of sextets in their ground-state configuration than their <b>linear</b> analogues. The <b>ionization</b> potentials (IPs) of nonlinear acenes decrease more slowly with annellation in comparison to their linear counterparts. As a result, 2 -D bistetracene derivatives that are composed of eight fused benzene rings are measured to be about 200 times more stable in chlorinated organic solvents than pentacene derivatives with only five fused rings. Single crystals of the bistetracene derivatives have hole mobilities, measured in OFET configuration, up to 6. 1 cm(2) V- 1 s(- 1), with remarkable I-on/I-off ratios of 10 (7). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations can provide insight into the electronic structures at both molecular and material levels and to evaluate the main charge-transport parameters. The 2 -D acenes with large aspect ratios and appropriate substituents have the potential to provide favorable interstack electronic interactions, and correspondingly high carrier mobilities. In stark contrast to the 1 -D acenes that form mono- and bis-adducts with fullerenes, 2 -D PAHs show less reactivity with fullerenes. The geometry of 2 -D PAHs plays a crucial role in determining both the barrier and the adduct stability. The reactivity and stability of the 2 -D PAHs with regard to Diels Alder reactions at different reactive sites were explained via DFT calculations of the reaction kinetics and of thermodynamics of reactions and simple Huckel molecular orbital considerations. Also, because of their increased stability in the presence of fullerenes, these compounds have been successfully used in OPVs. The small-molecule semiconductors highlighted in this Account exhibit good charge-transport properties, comparable to those of traditional linear acenes, while being much more environmentally stable. These features have made these 2 -D PAHs excellent molecules for fundamental research and device applications...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe aim of {{the modern}} {{radiotherapy}} {{is to get a}} homogenous dose distribution in PTV, which is obtained by using for example physical or dynamic wedges. The using of a physical wedge has provided such isodose distributions but their use resulted in detrimental dosimetric consequences, for example beam hardening effects and practical consequences of filter handling or possible misalignment. Linear accelerators are now equipped with collimator jaws systems and controlled by modern computers and it is possible to generate wedge shaped isodose distributions dynamically. Because of a more comfortable use of a dynamic wedge, there are alternatives to the standard physical wedge. During the treatment, different segments of the treatment field can be exposed to the primary beam at different intervals of time. This process of shrinking the field while modulating the collimator jaw velocity and dose rate creates the desired wedge-shaped isodose gradient across the treatment field. Dynamic wedges can replace physical wedges but they need more precise dosimetry and quality control procedures. AimThe aim {{of this study was to}} perform a multienergetic verification of dynamic wedge angles using the multichannel detector PTW LA 48 linear array. Material and methodsThe measurements of angle value of dynamic wedges were performed for Clinac 2300 C/D accelerators (Varian). The accelerator was equipped with the EDW option for 6 MV and 15 MV photon beams. In this case, 7 wedge angle values were used: 10 °, 15 °, 20 °, 25 °, 30 °, 45 ° and 60 °. The dynamic wedges are realized by continuous movement of one collimator jaw. The field size is gradually reduced until the collimator is almost completely closed or the field increases, while the beam is on. The measurements were divided in two steps: in the first step, the dynamic wedges were verified with the recommended values and in the second step there the planned and measured angles of dynamic wedges were compared. Measurements were made by means of LA 48 <b>linear</b> array of <b>ionization</b> chambers (PTW). The results of the measurements were compared with the reference profile produced by the treatment planning system ECLIPSE 8. 5 (Varian). ResultsThe results showed differences between measured and calculated angle of dynamic wedges. The differences were observed for both energies in the case of a small angle value. For energies 6 MV and 15 MV, almost all percentage difference between the measured and calculated profile was lower than 5 %. The biggest difference was observed in the first step of measurements when the angle of Dynamic Wedge was verified. The comparison between the planned and measured angle value of Dynamic Wedge showed the difference between 0. 1 % and 4. 5 %. The difference for 6 MV for the angle value of 10 ° in orientation IN was 1. 1 % and for energy 15 MV in the same case the difference was 3. 8 %. Thinner wedges exhibit less difference. ConclusionIt is necessary to provide comprehensive quality control procedure for enhanced dynamic wedges. Verification measurements should be an obligatory procedure in the recommendation for the testing of medical accelerators. These results are the preliminary results to provide measurements in other Polish Cancer Centres...|$|R
