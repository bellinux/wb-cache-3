5|$|In 2008, the Northern Territory Wildlife Park in Australia {{recorded}} {{their first}} <b>litter</b> <b>of</b> quoll pups in the park. The quolls bred well in captivity, with over 15 litters in the 2008 breeding season alone.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{particularly}} steep descent the following day, half of Mawson's team of dogs—reattached to his sledges—were almost lost when they {{fell into a}} crevasse. They were hauled out, but Mawson decided to camp {{when one of the}} dogs, Ginger Bitch, gave birth to the first in a <b>litter</b> <b>of</b> fourteen pups.|$|E
5|$|Geastrum quadrifidum, {{commonly}} known as the rayed earthstar or four-footed earthstar, is an inedible species of mushroom belonging to the genus Geastrum, or earthstar fungi. First described scientifically by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1794, G.quadrifidum is a cosmopolitan—but not common—species of Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australasia. The fungus is a saprobe, feeding off decomposing organic matter present in the soil and <b>litter</b> <b>of</b> coniferous forests.|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} <b>of</b> 54 <b>litters</b> <b>of</b> individual versus 54 <b>litters</b> <b>of</b> group housed organic {{lactating sows}} (grouped at three) beginning with day 14 after birth demonstrated that – despite significant behavioural adaptation and agonistic behaviour {{of the group}} housed lactating sows – the piglets’ body weight development, diseases and loss rates were similar between the two housing systems. In consequence {{there were no differences}} in productivity between the <b>litters</b> <b>of</b> single and group housed lactating sows...|$|R
25|$|A pair in the Washington Park Zoo {{produced}} 10 <b>litters,</b> each consisting <b>of</b> one kitten; two <b>litters</b> <b>of</b> {{a single}} kitten each were {{born at the}} Wassenaar Zoo in the Netherlands; and a single kitten was reported for another <b>litter.</b> Two <b>litters</b> <b>of</b> two kittens each were born at a private cat breeding facility in California, but neither litter survived.|$|R

5|$|Hagenbeck's modern zoo {{techniques}} proved effective, and Edinburgh quickly {{gained a}} reputation for its good animal conditions. 1934 saw the births in captivity of a sea lion and beaver, and in 1936 a baby chimpanzee followed. A <b>litter</b> <b>of</b> wolves was born in 1938, and soon afterwards the first orangutan to be born in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Tatuidris, or {{armadillo}} ant, {{is a rare}} genus of ants {{consisting of}} a single species, Tatuidris tatusia. The ants are small in size and inhabit the leaf <b>litter</b> <b>of</b> Neotropical forests in Central and South America, from Mexico to Brazil. Workers are ferruginous-colored to dark red and present a distinctive morphology, consisting of a shield-like head with a broad vertex, ventrally-turned heavy mandibles which do not overlap at full closure, and unique among ants– an antenna socket apparatus sitting upside-down. Little {{is known about the}} biology of the ants, but they are likely nocturnal and specialist predators.|$|E
5|$|The adult {{wolves and}} their pups {{remained}} east of Medford in the Rogue River watershed, and in early 2015 officials named the group the Rogue Pack, the ninth contemporary wolf pack in Oregon. By July, wildlife biologists {{found evidence that}} OR-7 and his mate had produced a second <b>litter</b> <b>of</b> pups. A month later, trail cameras identified two new pups, bringing the known total of wolves in this pack to seven. By 2016, the pack size had grown to nine.|$|E
50|$|Females {{are capable}} of {{becoming}} pregnant immediately after giving birth, and can nurse one litter while pregnant with another. Females are able to produce and raise two healthy <b>litters</b> <b>of</b> normal size and weight without significantly changing their own food intake. However, when food is restricted, females can extend pregnancy by over two weeks, and give birth to <b>litters</b> <b>of</b> normal number and weight.|$|R
50|$|Female voles {{have two}} to four <b>litters</b> <b>of</b> two to eight young in a year.|$|R

5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{cycle of}} the fisher lasts almost a year. Female fishers {{give birth to a}} <b>litter</b> <b>of</b> three or four kits in the spring. They nurse and care for their kits until late summer, when they are old enough to set out on their own. Females enter estrus shortly after giving birth and leave the den to find a mate. Implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until the following spring, when they give birth and the cycle is renewed.|$|E
5|$|Wartime interruptions in {{the supply}} of gas for heating {{resulted}} {{in the deaths of}} all the zoo's tropical fish and several other animals, including a lioness called Pearl and her <b>litter</b> <b>of</b> cubs. Although Manchester was heavily bombed during the Blitz, the gardens sustained only minor damage. The Scenic Railway was hit by an incendiary bomb and the Reptile House was damaged by shell splinters from ack-ack guns, which also caused the death of a bull bison.|$|E
5|$|Wellard is {{a fictional}} Belgian Tervuren dog from the BBC soap opera EastEnders. He first {{appeared}} in the series on 18 October 1994, and became EastEnders longest-serving pet, before being killed off on 15 August 2008. Although the character is male, he has been played primarily by three female dogs: Zenna, her daughter Chancer, and her granddaughter Kyte. A fourth dog briefly served as a replacement for Zenna in 1996, when she was given time off from the show to have a <b>litter</b> <b>of</b> puppies.|$|E

5|$|Canids {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, having arrived {{independently}} or accompanied human beings over {{extended periods of}} time. Canids vary in size from the 2-m-long (6ft 7 in) gray wolf to the 24-cm-long (9.4in) fennec fox. The body forms of canids are similar, typically having long muzzles, upright ears, teeth adapted for cracking bones and slicing flesh, long legs, and bushy tails. They are mostly social animals, living together in family units or small groups and behaving cooperatively. Typically, only the dominant pair in a group breeds, and a <b>litter</b> <b>of</b> young is reared annually in an underground den. Canids communicate by scent signals and by vocalizations. They are very intelligent. One canid, the domestic dog, long ago entered into a partnership with humans and today {{remains one of the}} most widely kept domestic animals.|$|E
5|$|Capybara {{gestation}} is 130–150 days, {{and produces}} a <b>litter</b> <b>of</b> four capybara young on average, but may produce {{between one and}} eight in a single litter. Birth is on land and the female rejoins the group {{within a few hours}} of delivering the newborn capybaras, which join the group as soon as they are mobile. Within a week, the young can eat grass, but continue to suckle—from any female in the group—until weaned around 16 weeks. The young form a group within the main group. Alloparenting has been observed in this species. Breeding peaks between April and May in Venezuela and between October and November in Mato Grosso, Brazil.|$|E
5|$|He and Doctor Phlox then tend to Porthos, and Archer {{spends the}} night in Sickbay {{to be with his}} pet. Throughout the night, as Porthos' immune system weakens, Archer {{experiences}} Phlox's side of life in Sickbay. During the night, as he dreams of Porthos' funeral, Archer also deals with unresolved and suppressed sexual tension with T'Pol. He also relates to Phlox how he met Porthos, and how he was the last in a <b>litter</b> <b>of</b> four male puppies, the 'Four Musketeers'. Through it all, Archer struggles to reach an emotional understanding with Phlox and T'Pol, as the two alien senior-crew members have little grasp of the human-pet relationship, and Phlox keeps offering Archer unsolicited advice about dealing with his apparent feelings for T'Pol.|$|E

50|$|Singing voles breed from May to September, {{and each}} female can {{give birth to}} up to three litters in a {{breeding}} season. Gestation lasts 21 days, and typically results in the birth of eight young, although <b>litters</b> <b>of</b> between 6 and 14 young have been reported. Since, like other voles, the female has only eight teats, <b>litters</b> <b>of</b> more than eight young are unlikely to survive.|$|R
50|$|Females are {{pregnant}} between January and June, and {{give birth to}} <b>litters</b> <b>of</b> up to four young.|$|R
5|$|It {{is active}} {{throughout}} the year, primarily at night. Gestation {{is about three}} weeks, and the female has a <b>litter</b> <b>of</b> three or four young. Nests in the wild, built from shredded bark, are in a tunnel or under a log. Marsh shrews typically live about 18 months, and males are not thought to reach sexual maturity during their first summer. Since their lifespan is short, they apparently breed for only one season. Although no breeding data exist for British Columbia, the breeding season elsewhere is from late January to late August; most young are born in March. The number of litters a female rears is unknown.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May 1948, {{the pair}} left {{to work on}} a {{government-funded}} groundnut food scheme in East Africa. There was some difficulty in getting permission for Judy to travel, and it was feared that she and Williams would be split up. This issue was promoted in the Evening Standard, and after the involvement of William Lever, 2nd Viscount Leverhulme, permission was given for Judy to travel with Williams. She had a third and final <b>litter</b> <b>of</b> puppies during her time in Africa. After two years there, Judy was discovered to have a mammary tumour; an operation removed the growth, but a tetanus infection soon set in, and she was euthanized on 17 February 1950 at the age of nearly 14. She was buried in her RAF jacket, with her campaign medals, the Pacific Star, the 1939–1945 Star, and the Defence Medal. Frank spent two months building a granite and marble memorial in her memory, which included a plaque that told of her life story.|$|E
5|$|Small rodents {{form the}} largest {{part of the}} least weasel's diet, but it also kills and eats rabbits, other mammals, and {{occasionally}} birds, birds' eggs, fish and frogs. Males mark their territories with olfactory signals and have exclusive home ranges which may intersect with or include several female ranges. Least weasels use pre-existing holes to sleep, store food and raise their young. Breeding {{takes place in the}} spring and summer, and there is a single <b>litter</b> <b>of</b> about six kits which are reared exclusively by the female. Due to its small size and fierce nature, the least weasel plays an important part in the mythology and legend of various cultures.|$|E
50|$|Reproduction {{begins in}} mid-May {{with two or}} three <b>litters</b> <b>of</b> between four and nine young {{produced}} annually.|$|R
50|$|The North African sengi {{typically}} {{gives birth}} to <b>litters</b> <b>of</b> 1 to 4 young twice a year.|$|R

5|$|Meat, {{mainly from}} farmed animals, {{is a major}} source of dietary protein around the world, {{averaging}} about 8% of man's energy intake. The actual types eaten depend on local preferences, availability, cost and other factors, with cattle, sheep, pigs and goats being the main species involved. Cattle generally produce a single offspring annually which takes more than a year to mature; sheep and goats often have twins and these are ready for slaughter in less than a year; pigs are more prolific, producing more than one <b>litter</b> <b>of</b> up to about 11 piglets each year. Horses, donkeys, deer, buffalo, llamas, alpacas, guanacos and vicunas are farmed for meat in various regions. Some desirable traits of animals raised for meat include fecundity, hardiness, fast growth rate, ease of management and high food conversion efficiency. About half of the world's meat is produced from animals grazing on open ranges or on enclosed pastures, the other half being produced intensively in various factory-farming systems; these are mostly cows, pigs or poultry, and often reared indoors, typically at high densities.|$|E
5|$|Often found {{lying on}} the bottom buried in sediment, the roughtail {{stingray}} is a generalist predator that feeds {{on a variety of}} benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous, with the embryos receiving nourishment initially from yolk, and later from histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. In the northwestern Atlantic, females bear an annual <b>litter</b> <b>of</b> 4–6 young in fall and early winter, after a gestation period of 9–11 months. By contrast, in the Mediterranean there is evidence that females bear two litters of 2–6 young per year after a gestation period of only four months. Rays in the northwestern Atlantic are also larger at birth and at sexual maturity than those from the Mediterranean. The venomous tail spine of the roughtail stingray is potentially dangerous to humans. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern overall and in the northwestern Atlantic, where it is not commercially utilized. However, in the Mediterranean and southwestern Atlantic it is subject to heavy fishing pressure and has been assessed as Near Threatened.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} long-coated Russian Toy {{is arguably}} a dog named Chikki born on 12 October 1958 to two smooth-coated dogs that both had slightly longer hair than was typical. Initially, the puppy {{was not to}} be registered as its coat was too long meet the breed standard, and usually such dogs would not participate in breeding programs and would often be put down. Chikki, however, was registered with a pedigree and purchased by Evgeniya Fominichna Zharova. Zharova is thus the long-coated variety's founding breeder as the first breeder to intentionally retain and breed a dog with a longer coat. Chikki developed an ear fringe and was mated with a female named Irma, who also had a longer coat than most smooth-coated dogs, and together they produced a <b>litter</b> <b>of</b> three long-coated puppies. Zharova developed the breed in Moscow, and so it {{came to be known as}} the Moscow Toy Terrier. The breed made its first appearance at a dog show in 1964 and the standard was set in 1966. Ten years after Chikki's birth, between 1968 and 1969, approximately 300 long-coated dogs were registered – a significant number considering that Russian Toy litters tend to be small, typically one to three puppies. Today, the long-coated variety has an established presence in Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, the Ukraine and a number of other countries, but the breeding program is particularly strong in Finland.|$|E
