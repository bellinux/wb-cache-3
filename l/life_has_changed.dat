Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, or traditional knowledge, such as storytelling, mythology, music and dancing remain important parts of the culture. Family and community are very important.

When the Spanish arrived in 1494, except for small agricultural clearings, {{the country was}} deeply forested. The European settlers cut down the great timber trees for building and ships' supplies, and cleared the plains, savannas, and mountain slopes for intense agricultural cultivation. Many new plants were introduced including sugarcane, bananas, and citrus trees.|$|E

500|$|The {{tour was}} chronicled in the {{documentary}} titled I'm Going to Tell You a Secret. Originally called The Re-Invented Process {{in reference to the}} tour and the exhibition X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS, the documentary was filmed during Madonna's visit to North America and Europe from May 24 to September 14, 2004. It was directed by Jonas Åkerlund, whose previous endeavors included music videos, commercials and the cult film, Spun (2003). The documentary emerged from Madonna's urge to show her artistic side on the tour and her devotion towards the Jewish mysticism Kabbalah. Unlike her 1991 documentary, , which portrayed Hollywood glamour, I'm Going to Tell You a Secret clarified from its beginning that it was about the singer's views on life and spirituality. [...] "It's a different me, I have a husband, I have a family, my whole <b>life</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed.</b> It would be pretty strange if I was behaving the same way I did 12 years ago— that would be a little freaky. No more Evian bottles!", Madonna told MTV, with the last bit referring to a scene of her performing fellatio on an Evian bottle in Truth or Dare.|$|E
500|$|In the {{original}} animated film, the Beast does little singing {{apart from a}} brief solo during [...] "Something There" [...] because Menken and Ashman {{had not been able}} to agree upon a suitable moment within the film during which the Beast could have performed his own song. However, Menken considered it imperative that the character sing a solo in both the stage and live-action adaptations because he believes the Beast is actually the story's protagonist [...] "whose <b>life</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> in the most dramatic way." [...] In the stage production, the Beast performs the ballad [...] "If I Can't Love Her" [...] after he frightens Belle away from the castle, wondering if he will ever be able to love anyone since he struggles to love her. Menken and Condon had deliberated whether or not the song should be re-used in the remake; despite Menken's strong attachment to [...] "If I Can't Love Her", the musical number was ultimately omitted because it had been written specifically to conclude the first act of a Broadway musical. Screenwriter Stephen Chbosky had originally suggested that the character receive a new song to perform some time after he has saved Belle from the wolves. Due to the remake's three-act structure, Menken and Condon concluded that it would be best to replace [...] "If I Can't Love Her" [...] with a song that better depicts the Beast's feelings for Belle after he has finally learned to love her and realizes she is no longer his prisoner, while accepting the grimm reality that releasing her would ultimately decrease his chances of becoming human again. Rice, who co-wrote [...] "If I Can't Love Her" [...] with Menken, further convinced the composer to substitute [...] "If I Can't Love Her" [...] with a more appropriate song, joking, [...] "it would be like writing 'Don't Cry for Me Brazil'," [...] referring to [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina", a song he famously wrote for the stage musical Evita.|$|E

Isn't it, after all, the most sensible, the only way out of a situation that has become impossible? Times have changed, Nancy, and you yourself have been the first to admit it. Marriage is no longer what it was, and people are coming to look upon it more sensibly. In order to perpetuate the institution, as it was, segregation, insulation, was the only course. Men segregated their wives, women their husbands,--the only logical method of procedure, but it limited the individual. Our mothers and fathers thought it scandalous if husband or wife paid visits alone. It wasn't done. But our modern <b>life</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> all that. A marriage, to be a marriage, should be proof against disturbing influences, should leave the individuals free; the binding element should be love, not the force of an imposed authority.

But I shouldn't really like to prophesy which will adapt itself to the other--education or {{business}}. Let us hope there will be mutual concessions. There are some pessimists who say that business methods, especially on the large scale of the trusts and combinations, have grown worse instead of better; but this may be merely {{what is called a}} 'transition state.' Hamlet must be cruel to be kind; the darkest hour comes before dawn--and so on. Perhaps when business gets the whole affair of life into its hands, and runs the republic, as its enemies now accuse it of doing, the process of purging and living cleanly will begin. I have known lots of fellows who started in life rather scampishly; but when they felt secure of themselves, and believed that they could afford to be honest, they became so. There's no reason why the same thing shouldn't happen on a large scale. We must never forget that we are still a very novel experiment, though we have matured so rapidly in some respects that we have come to regard ourselves as an accomplished fact. We are really less so than we were forty years ago, with all the tremendous changes since the war. Before that we could take certain matters for granted. If a man got out of work, he turned his hand to something else; if a man failed in business, he started in again from some other direction; as a last resort, in both cases, he went West, pre-empted a quarter-section of public land, and grew up with the country. Now the country is grown up; the public land is gone; business is full on all sides, and the hand that turned itself to something else has lost its cunning. The struggle for <b>life</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> from a free-fight to an encounter of disciplined forces, and the free-fighters that are left get ground to pieces between organized labor and organized capital. Decidedly, we are in a transition state, and if the higher education tried to adapt itself to business needs, there are chances that it might sacrifice itself without helping business. After all, how much education does business need? Were our great fortunes made by educated men, or men of university training? I don't know but these young fellows are right about that." ...|$|E
