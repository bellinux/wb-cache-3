500|$|After being weighed, {{a loaded}} wagon, which would hold about [...] of coal, was {{pulled from the}} weighbridge, onto a raisable or <b>lowerable</b> cradle at the hoist to suit the coal chute and a vessel's open hold.|$|E
50|$|An airdrop {{is a type}} of airlift, {{developed}} during World War II to resupply otherwise inaccessible troops, who themselves may have been airborne forces. In some cases, it is used to refer to the airborne assault itself. Early airdrops were conducted by dropping or pushing padded bundles from aircraft. Later small crates with parachutes were pushed out of the aircraft's side cargo doors. Later cargo aircraft were designed with rear access ramps, <b>lowerable</b> in flight, that allowed large platforms to be rolled out the back.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the need}} to run up onto a {{suitable}} beach, World War II landing craft were flat-bottomed, and many designs had a flat front, often with a <b>lowerable</b> ramp, rather than a normal bow. This made them difficult to control and very uncomfortable in rough seas. The control point (too rudimentary to call a bridge on LCA and similar craft) was normally at the extreme rear of the vessel, as were the engines. In all cases, they were known by an abbreviation derived from the official name rather than by the full title.|$|E
5000|$|The company {{initially}} {{used the}} trade name of [...] "Atlas" [...] for the accessory and supply segment, producing vehicle lights, signaling equipment, fuel and oil canisters, jacks and air pumps. In October 1926, the company patented its crank drive for <b>lowerable</b> windows. After buying {{the rights to}} use the patent for the wrap sling brake from the American company Ternstedt, series production of mechanical window regulators started in 1928. Commonly {{referred to as a}} window crank apparatus, this device was also manufactured for buses, trains and streetcars. Windshields and ventilation systems expanded the range of products in the years following.|$|E
5000|$|USS California and {{her sister}} ship, [...] were {{equipped}} with two single-armed Mk 13 launchers, fore and aft, for the Standard Missile, one ASROC missile launcher, and two Mk-141 launchers for the Harpoon missiles. These cruisers were equipped with two 5-inch/54 calibre Mk 45 guns rapid-fire cannons, fore and aft. The two cruisers also had a unique arrangement aft of their superstructures with a flight deck and <b>lowerable</b> safety fences. Both cruisers also had full suites of anti-submarine warfare equipment. Thus, these warships were designed to combat all threats, in the air, on the surface, and underwater.|$|E
50|$|Each LLWAS {{equipped}} airport {{may have}} {{as few as}} six or as many as thirty-two remote stations. Each remote station uses a 150 ft tall pole with anemometer and radio-telecommunication equipment mounted on a <b>lowerable</b> ring. Remote station wind measurements are transmitted to a master station at the Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT), which polls the remote stations, runs wind shear and gust front algorithms, and generates warnings when windshear or microburst conditions are detected. Current observations and warnings are displayed for approach controllers in the Terminal Radar Approach Control Facility (TRACON) and for local and ground controllers in the Air Traffic Control Tower.|$|E
50|$|The coal tipping cranes, (referred to as coal-tips, hoists or staiths by the Barry Railway Co) were {{elevated}} {{well above}} water level. After being weighed, a loaded wagon, which would hold about 10 LT of coal, was {{pulled from the}} weighbridge, onto a raisable or <b>lowerable</b> cradle at the hoist to suit the coal chute and a vessels open hold.The cradle was held within a tower, and usually had a downhill gradient railtrack of 1 in 233 towards the weighbridge but a 1 in 70 downhill incline out.The cradle could also be raised or lowered as the dock water level varied.Using hydraulic power, the cradle was tilted to an angle, so the coal {{ran out of the}} wagon and down a coal chute into the hold of the vessel below.At the start of loading, the coal would run into a suspended anti-breakage box, which was hydraulically lowered into the hold and emptied through a hinged flap at the bottom.As loading proceeded, a cone of coal built up below the anti-breakage box until it reached the height {{of the end of the}} chute.At this stage the anti-breakage box was swung out of the way and the coal allowed to run directly down the chute and down the sides of the cone at its angle of repose.Coal trimmers in the hold would level the coal.|$|E

40|$|Let (X, T) be a topological {{dynamical}} system (TDS), and h (T, K) the topological entropy of {{a subset}} K of X.

40|$|The device (1) has comb-type bearing {{supporting}} bars (4) {{provided for}} passage of goods {{to be transported}} between rollers (9) of a running surface (2). An upper edge of the supporting bars is slightly higher than the running surface formed by the transport rollers. Stripping stoppers for the goods are provided in a driving direction behind the transport rollers. The supporting bars are designed in a raised or <b>lowerable</b> manner in a transport vehicle (3), where the supporting bars exhibit a front abutting chamfer and a rear running chamfer in a driving direction...|$|E

The positioning units are equipped with driven rollers mounted in movable bearings above the positioning table and <b>lowerable</b> onto the positioning table, whereby the rotary axes of the rollers are about parallel to the service of the positioning table.

40|$|The {{algebraic}} {{notion of}} openings of a map-germ is introduced in this paper. An opening separates the self-intersections {{of the original}} map-germ, preserving its singularities. The notion of openings {{is different from the}} notion of unfoldings. Openings do not unfold the singularities. For example, the swallowtail is an opening of the Whitney’s cusp map-germ from plane to plane and the open swallowtail is a versal opening of them. Openings of map-germs appear as typical singularities in several problems of geometry and its applications. The notion of openings has close relations to isotropic map-germs in a symplectic space and integral map-germs in a contact space. We describe the openings of Morin singularities, namely, stable unfoldings of map-germs of corank one. The relation of unfoldings and openings are discussed. Moreover we provide a method to construct versal openings of map-germs and give versal openings of stable map-germs (R 4, 0) ! (R 4, 0). Lastly the relation of <b>lowerable</b> vector fields and openings is discussed. ...|$|E
