The production of human milk (lactogenesis) {{is dependent on}} factors in the blood therefore deranged blood parameters in HIV patients are expected to reflect in the components of breast milk. Study on effects of HIV infection on nutritional components of breast milk and plasma is scarce. This study assessed the impact which HIV infection might have on the nutritional quality of human breast milk and plasma by determining the levels of biochemical nutritional factors such as albumin, pre-albumin, transferrin and retinol binding in HIV infected <b>lactating</b> <b>mothers</b> (n= 20) and HIV-negative <b>lactating</b> <b>mothers</b> (n= 30) using immunoplates. The mean plasma level of albumin was significantly reduced in HIV infected <b>lactating</b> <b>mothers</b> (HIM) compared with HIV-negative <b>lactating</b> <b>mothers</b> (control).

5000|$|While {{the goal}} of {{vegetarian}} ecofeminism is to end all oppression, it does focus on the connections between the oppression of nonhuman animals and the oppression of women. Both are objectified by men within the dominate discourse of the patriarchy, though in different ways: women are seen as sex objects and nonhuman animals are seen as food. In both instances, both beings {{are considered to be}} less than men, and therefore are able to be used, abused, and consumed by those with more privilege. There are often essentialistic and empathetic connections made between human mothers and nonhuman mothers, and ecofeminist scholar Carol Adams exemplifies this when she states [...] "As a <b>lactating</b> <b>mother,</b> I empathize with the sow whose reproductive freedoms have been denied and whose nursing experience seems so wretched." [...] Generalizing women as mothers is problematic because not all women identify as mothers, yet there often is a strong link made between women and nonhuman animals due to their shared experience and oppression as mothers.|$|E
5000|$|As an oral form, the supplementation {{of vitamin}} A is {{effective}} for lowering {{the risk of}} morbidity, especially from severe diarrhea, and reducing mortality from measles and all-cause mortality. Studies have shown that vitamin A supplementation of children under five {{who are at risk}} of VAD can reduce all‐cause mortality by 23 per cent. Some countries where VAD is a public health problem address its elimination by including vitamin A supplements available in capsule form with National Immunization Days (NIDs) for polio eradication or measles. Additionally, the delivery of vitamin A supplements, during integrated child health events such as child health days, have helped ensure high coverage of vitamin A supplementation in a large number of least developed countries. Child health events enable many countries in West and Central Africa to achieve over 80 per cent coverage of vitamin A supplementation. According to UNICEF Data, in 2013 worldwide, 65 per cent of {{children between the ages of}} 6 and 59 months were fully protected with two high-dose vitamin A supplements. Vitamin A capsules cost about US$0.02. The capsules are easy to handle; they don’t need to be stored in a refrigerator or vaccine carrier. When the correct dosage is given, vitamin A is safe and has no negative effect on seroconversion rates for Oral Polio Vaccine or measles vaccine. However, because the benefit of vitamin A supplements is transient, children need them regularly every four to six months. Since NIDs provide only one dose per year, NIDs-linked vitamin A distribution must be complemented by other dose programs to maintain vitamin A in children Maternal high supplementation benefits both mother and breast-fed infant: high-dose vitamin A supplementation of the <b>lactating</b> <b>mother</b> in the first month postpartum can provide the breast-fed infant with an appropriate amount of vitamin A through breast milk. However, high-dose supplementation of pregnant women should be avoided because it can cause miscarriage and birth defects.|$|E

40|$|Background: Iodine is {{essential}} for normal growth, mental development and survival of infants. Bangladesh is an iodine deficient region. Breast milk is {{the only source of}} iodine for exclusively breast-fed infants. Routine measurement of breast milk iodine concentration is very difficult in our country due to some social and religious barriers. So, we designed this study in our population using urinary iodine as the indicator for assessing iodine status. Objectives: To assess the iodine status of <b>lactating</b> <b>mothers</b> and their breast-fed infants and to propose a method on how to predict the iodine concentration in breast milk. Materials and Methods: This observational analytical study was carried out in the department of Biochemistry, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka with active cooperation of Kumudini Women’s Medical College Hospital, Mirzapur, Tangail involving fifty <b>lactating</b> <b>mothers</b> and their exclusively breast-fed infants. Early morning urine and breast milk samples were collected in dry and clean plastic container free from any chemical contamination. All statistical analyses were done by using SPSS (Statistical Programme for Social Science) 12 version software package for windows. Results: The median (range) urinary iodine concentration of <b>lactating</b> <b>mothers</b> and their breast-fed infants were 225. 25 μg/L (61. 50 - 530. 00) and 225. 75 μg/L (100. 50 - 526. 50). 96 % (48) mothers had no biochemical iodine deficiency (UIE ≥ 100 μg/L), only 4 % (2) mothers had mild biochemical iodine deficiency (UIE 50 - 99 μg/L). There was no biochemical deficiency of breast-fed infants. The median (range) breast-milk iodine concentration was 157 μg/L (54. 50 - 431. 50) which was more than three times of recommended minimum concentration (50 μg/L). Iodine in breast milk of <b>lactating</b> <b>mothers</b> positively correlated with their urinary iodine excretion (P< 0. 01). Infant’s urinary iodine positively correlated with iodine concentration in breast milk (P< 0. 01) and also positively correlated with urinary iodine excretion of <b>lactating</b> <b>mothers.</b> Conclusion: <b>Lactating</b> <b>mothers</b> and their breast-fed infants in this study were found iodine sufficient.

40|$|Objective: The {{cross-sectional}} study {{was carried out}} to assess the iodine status of pregnant and <b>lactating</b> <b>mothers,</b> using median urinary iodine excretion (UIE) as the measure of outcome, to document the prevalence of iodine deficiency. Materials and Methods: The present study assessed the UIE in the morning urine samples from 237 pregnant women, 73 <b>lactating</b> <b>mothers</b> and 59 healthy non-pregnant female controls. Results: Out of 237 pregnant women, 88 (37 %) exhibited insufficient iodine nutrition (UIE < 150 μg/l), out of 73 <b>lactating</b> <b>mothers,</b> 24 (33 %) exhibited insufficient iodine nutrition (UIE < 100 μg/l) and only 3 % female control subjects exhibited insufficient iodine nutrition (UIE < 100 μg/l). Additionally, a number (32. 3 %) of babies born of iodine deficient mothers had respiratory distress at birth. Conclusion: It appears that the present salt iodination program is adequate for the general population but insufficient for the pregnant and <b>lactating</b> <b>mothers.</b> They need to be targeted with iodine supplements throughout pregnancy and lactation. Increased incidence of respiratory distress in the new born of iodine deficient mothers merits further study...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Lactating</b> <b>mothers</b> from low-income {{countries}} including Ethiopia are {{considered as a}} nutritionally vulnerable group due to different socio demographic factors which impact on the health and wellbeing of children. Adequate nutrition for the mothers during lactation is therefore important for their good health {{as well as for}} that of their offspring. We aimed to assess nutritional status, and associated factors among <b>lactating</b> <b>mothers</b> in Nekemte Hospital and Health Centers, East Wollega, Ethiopia. Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2014 to June 2014.

40|$|Background: Nutritional {{status of}} women is {{particularly}} important, because it is through women and their off-spring that the pernicious effects of malnutrition are propagated to future generations. The extra calories and nutrients required to support breastfeeding makes <b>lactating</b> <b>mothers</b> among groups with special nutritional needs. Nevertheless, many African <b>lactating</b> <b>mothers,</b> including Ethiopians, remained to be undernourished and there is scarcity of studies both nationally and in the study locality. Objectives: This study was aimed to assess factors associated with malnutrition among <b>lactating</b> <b>mothers</b> living in Home-based food production and child centered counseling project Kebeles in Dedo and Seqa-Chekorsa districts of Jimma zone, south-west Ethiopia from Feb. 3 to March 2, 2014.
