40|$|Abstract. Road scene {{segmentation}} {{is important in}} computer vision for different applications such as autonomous driving and pedestrian detection. Recovering the 3 D structure of road scenes provides relevant contextual information to improve their understanding. In this paper, we use a convolutional neural network based algorithm to learn features from noisy labels to recover the 3 D scene <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>road</b> image. The novelty of the algorithm relies on generating training labels by applying an algorithm trained on a general image dataset to classify on–board images. Further, we propose a novel texture descriptor based on a learned color plane fusion to obtain maximal uniformity in road areas. Finally, acquired (off–line) and current (on–line) information are combined to detect road areas in single images. From quantitative and qualitative experiments, conducted on publicly available datasets, it is concluded that convolutional neural networks are suitable for learning 3 D scene layout from noisy labels and provides a relative improvement of 7 % compared to the baseline. Furthermore, combining color planes provides a statistical description of road areas that exhibits maximal uniformity and provides a relative improvement of 8 % compared to the baseline. Finally, the improvement is even bigger when acquired and current information from a single image are combined. ...|$|E
40|$|Safety Performance Indicators for roads; Searching for a {{quantitative}} road safety assessment method. Safety Performance Indicators (SPIs) are {{factors that have}} a strong causal relationship with road safety. Typical of SPIs for roads is that different road features in varying combinations can influence {{the safety of a}} road. In a multi-year project SWOV performs research into data and existing initiatives in the field of SPIs. This is done with the purpose to develop a new method to quantitatively describe, evaluate and monitor the road safety of the road network and road design. In the second year of this research project the central question was: How can the road safety of existing and future roads be integrally measured and assessed ? For an answer to this question, the authors first searched for possible SPIs for the road safety of roads. They performed a zero measurement and a pilot monitor of the two most appropriate tools: the Sustainable Safety Indicator and VSGS (Safe Speeds, Credible Limits). The Sustainable Safety Indicator can be used {{to determine the extent to}} which the <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>road</b> conforms to the requirements of sustainable safety. VSGS is a tool to assess ‘safe speeds and credible speed limits’. In this framework, the following activities were carried out: 1. The Sustainable Safety Indicator and VSGS were used to assess a total of 154 roads in the Dutch towns Harderwijk en Leeuwarden; these roads were urban 50 km/h roads. 2. For each road the crash density was determined based on the registration of serious road injuries during the period 1998 - 2009. 3. The convergent validity of the instruments was determined. 4. The relationship between the scores of the instruments and crash density was determined (impression). This research failed to establish a relationship between Sustainable Safety Indicator scores, the VSGS scores and the crash rate. Because essential recent data on traffic volume and speeds driven was unavailable in this study, we have been unable to determine to what extent the Sustainable Safety Indicator or VSGS are valid instruments that can be used to classify composite features of road infrastructure as SPIs. However, a relationship was found between Sustainable Safety scores of roads, safe speeds and credible speed limits, which can be interpreted in terms of road safety. Recommendations of this study were: 1. Not all relations between the Sustainable Safety Indicator, VSGS and crash density that were found in this study are entirely explicable. Follow-up research, in which traffic volume and actual speeds driven are also included, is necessary in order to determine the extent to which these instruments can explain risk differences. 2. The ultimate goal is to determine SPI’s for urban infrastructure that can be used to quantitatively describe, assess and monitor the (road safety) quality of the road network and road design. This requires further study into among other things: a. The development of the traffic safety on different types of sustainably safe roads: is the road layout partly or fully in accordance with Sustainable Safety requirements ? Are these roads safer than roads without a sustainably safe layout? And: can these road safety relationships be determined with the Sustainable Safety Indicator and/or VSGS ? b. The relationship between the individual features that are included in the Sustainable Safety Indicator and VSGS on the one hand, and road safety on the other (which features are/are not decisive in the relationship with road safety ?) c. The question of whether the safety of a road is determined by the most extreme (high or low) value of a road feature, or by the calculated average for the entire road. In addition, additional research is required on the relationship between, the scores of the Sustainable Safety Indicator and VSGS in relation with speeds driven and traffic volume on the one hand, and the risk of a (serious) crash on the other hand. d. The suitability of the Sustainable Safety Indicator scores and VSGS-scores as an alternative for road crash data to assess the road safety of roads: are all features that are measured relevant as a measure of safety ? And: are the results of both instruments valid when it comes to a demonstrable relationship with road safety ? An important prerequisite is that the quality (registration rate, substantive registration of facts) of the crash registration increases...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes an {{optimisation}} model and a meta-heuristic algorithm for solving the urban network design problem. The problem consists in optimising the <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> urban <b>road</b> network by designing directions of existing roads and signal settings at intersections. A non-linear constrained {{optimisation model}} for solving {{this problem is}} formulated, adopting a bi-level approach {{in order to reduce}} the complexity of solution methods and the computation times. A Scatter Search algorithm based on a random descent method is proposed and tested on a real dimension network. Initial results show that the proposed approach allows local optimal solutions to be obtained in reasonable computation times. Network design Transportation Scatter Search...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} are {{examined}} two milestones <b>of</b> the “via <b>a</b> Karalibus Sulcos” found in Sardinia {{in the territory}} of Villamassargia (CI). The first, unpublished and dating back to 108 - 109 AD, shortly before {{the decision of the}} emperor Trajan to give back the administration of Sardinia to proconsuls sent by the Senate, is another example of the great attention paid to this road during Trajan’s age. Moreover the location of its discovery might reopen the matter <b>of</b> the exact <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> the <b>road.</b> <b>A</b> more extensive reading is proposed about the second milestone, already published and dated to {{the second half of the}} IIIrd century AD; in particular a new hypothesis is made for the reconstruction of the name of the governor mentioned therein, which could be compared to others remembered in Sardinian inscriptions of the time. Finally both documents can give information about the name of the road that does not seem to have been always the same...|$|R
40|$|In {{the report}} of late 2001 Safe, What is Safe?, SWOV {{indicated}} how the annual number of traffic casualties could be reduced considerably. These proposals were {{to be regarded as}} an addition to the proposals as were developed in the then National Traffic and Transport Plan of the Ministry of Transport. In Safe, What is Safe?, besides <b>a</b> speeding-up <b>of</b> the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sustainably-safe infrastrucure, a qualitatively better implementation was advocated. During the last few years, the introduction of Sustainably-Safe has become widespread. What the <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sustainably-safe <b>road</b> infrastructure should preferably look like has, in the meantime, become generally well known; it can be found in various publications about this subject. Apart from this, it should be noted that, for by no means all layout elements, is known precisely a) how they influence the accident chance, and b) the extent to which this chance would change if a preferable layout was deviated from. A second problem yet to be solved is that not all Sustainably-Safe principles have been transformed into design requirements. In particular, requirements for being able to plan sustainably-safe road networks are missing. A third problem refers to the realisation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sustainably-safe infrastructure. In practice it seems that it is not always so simple to meet the requirements and to decide whether the actual, practical experiences already indicate the need to modify the requirements. The underlying question in this is whether <b>a</b> greater <b>road</b> safety improvement in the Netherlands can be achieved if a higher quality implementation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sustainably-safe infrastructure was achieved. This study attempts to investigate {{the extent to which the}} current and planned road infrastructures meet the Sustainably-Safe requirements. To do this, both the network features (road categorizing) and the road segment and crossroads features have been tested. This testing was carried out in a region in the Netherlands (part of the southern province of Limburg). Based on this sample, there is, at the most, an indication for the situation in the whole country; there is no reason to suppose that the situation in that part of Limburg differs widely. SWOV has formulated new draft requirements for network features. These additional requirements concern the function <b>of</b> <b>a</b> connection in an area, the crossroads type, the detour factor, and the route choice. SWOV recommends including these requirements in the next review. Our study shows that, to a large extent, the tested network meets the requirements made. However, it is striking that only <b>a</b> limited number <b>of</b> intersections of two distributor roads now meet the current requirement, namely a roundabout. In this study, an extensive addition to the layout requirements was also drawn up for crossroads and road sections. Most of these requirements can be traced back to the requirement that certain conflicts on <b>a</b> Sustainably-Safe <b>road</b> category should not occur and, if a conflict cannot be avoided, only small speed differences are permitted. SWOV hereby recommends that these extra features be added to the existing requirements. Our study shows that the tested road network sometimes scores well, whereas other features score less well. That is why SWOV recommends examining why there is such a large spread in the results. In this situation, SWOV further recommends, for <b>a</b> limited number <b>of</b> requirements (namely those for which there are strong indications that they have a relation with severe accidents), that such agreements be made that they will always be met. The present study indicates that there is a need for such agreements...|$|R
