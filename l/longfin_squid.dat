Also, increasing ocean acidity {{is believed to}} have a range of direct consequences. For example, increasing acidity has been observed to: reduce metabolic rates in jumbo squid; depress the immune responses of blue mussels; and make it harder for juvenile clownfish to tell apart the smells of non-predators and predators, or hear the sounds of their predators. This is possibly because ocean acidification may alter the acoustic properties of seawater, allowing sound to propagate further, and increasing ocean noise. This impacts all animals that use sound for echolocation or communication.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This report summarizes the status marine fisheries resources, management, and related activities in Rhode Island for 2007. Rhode Island commercial fisheries landed almost 34 thousand metric tons valued at approximately $ 77 million in 2007, all species combined. The recreational fisheries harvested 2, 065 metric tons in 2007. Over half of recreational anglers were non-residents, as has been the case the past twenty-seven years. The most recent stock assessment information suggests that ten marine species important to Rhode Island are not overfished and overfishing is not occurring. These are the stocks of Atlantic herring, Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic menhaden, Atlantic striped bass, bluefish, <b>longfin</b> <b>squid</b> (Loligo), silver hake—Southern stock, little skates, spiny dogfish, and witch flounder.

40|$|Ocean {{acidification}} {{is predicted}} to lead to global oceanic decreases in pH of up to 0. 3 units within the next 100 years. However, those levels are already being reached currently in coastal regions due to natural CO 2 variability. Squid are a vital component of the pelagic ecosystem, holding a unique niche as a highly active predatory invertebrate and major prey stock for upper trophic levels. This study {{examined the effects of}} a range of ocean acidification regimes on the early life history of a coastal squid species, the Atlantic <b>longfin</b> <b>squid,</b> Doryteuthis pealeii. Eggs were raised in a flow-through ocean acidification system at CO 2 levels ranging from ambient (400 ppm) to 2200 ppm. Time to hatching, hatching efficiency, and hatchling mantle lengths, yolk sac sizes, and statoliths were all examined to elucidate stress effects. Delays in hatching time of at least a day were seen at exposures above 1300 ppm in all trials under controlled conditions. Mantle lengths were significantly reduced at exposures above 1300 ppm. Yolk sac sizes varied between CO 2 treatments, but no distinct pattern emerged. Statoliths were increasingly porous and malformed as CO 2 exposures increased, and were significantly reduced in surface area at exposures above 1300 ppm. Doryteuthis pealeii appears to be able to withstand acidosis stress without major effects up to 1300 ppm, but is strongly impacted past that threshold. Since yolk consumption did not vary among treatments, it appears that during its early life stages, D. pealeii reallocates its available energy budget away from somatic growth and system development in order to mitigate the stress of acidosis...|$|E
40|$|Multispecies {{interactions}} (predation and competition) {{are known}} to have important consequences for the dynamics of marine fish populations. These interactions depend on the spatial overlap among fish species in the community. Several approaches have been used to quantify species interactions, including production models and age- (or length) structured multispecies models. In this study, multi-species biomass dynamics models were extended to account for food-web interactions in multiple spatial areas (Gulf of Maine, Southern New England, and Georges Bank). A total of 15 fish species collected from the study areas were aggregated into four trophic groups: non-migrating benthivores (haddock, yellowtail flounder, winter flounder, and little skate), non-migrating piscivores (Atlantic cod and summer flounder), migrating piscivores (silver hake, spiny dogfish, winter skate, goosefish, pollock, and white hake), and migrating planktivores (Atlantic herring, Atlantic mackerel, <b>longfin</b> <b>squid).</b> The spatial distribution of each species group was determined from trawl-survey data, taking into account distributional shifts. We assumed that the migratory groups (planktivores and piscivores) range over the entire study area, such that their production can be described with a single set of model parameters (r and k). By contrast, production of non-migrating groups (piscivores and benthivores) was assessed with a different set of model parameters (r and k) for each spatial area. A hierarchical model fitting procedure was used to estimate the production parameters (r and k) and interaction coefficients among migrating and non-migrating species groups. In our study, migrating groups (F and P) played a spatially essential role in species interactions across multiple areas, indicating that the three spatial areas are functionally connected through the high degree of connectivity and direct linkages between migrating groups (F and P) and non-migrating groups (B and S). Our results demonstrate that accounting for trophic interactions improves the model fit and that the strength and direction of these interactions vary among spatial areas. Based on the area-specific interaction effects, this approach can help us understand the functional connections among multiple areas and thus inform current fisheries management. ...|$|E

5|$|The sand {{devil is}} an ambush {{predator}} that spends much time {{buried in the}} bottom sediment. Its diet consists mainly of demersal teleost fishes such as croakers, goatfishes, and butterfishes. However, some types of demersal fishes such as jacks are rarely eaten, perhaps {{because they are more}} active and thus likely to escape attacks. Squid are a major secondary food source, particularly for smaller sharks. Crabs, shrimp, mantis shrimp, skates, and bivalves are infrequently eaten. This species feeds both during the day and at night. It tends to select prey approximately 50–60% as long as its mouth is wide; this size is consistent with what is predicted from optimal foraging theory to yield the most efficient rate of energy return. The variety of prey taken is greatest in fall and least in winter, and smaller sharks have a more varied diet than larger ones. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey species are Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), longspine porgy (Stenotomus caprinus), spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Gulf butterfish (Peprilus burti), red goatfish (Mullus auratus), dwarf goatfish (Upeneus parvus), and <b>longfin</b> inshore <b>squid</b> (Doryteuthis pealeii). The relative importance of each differs across seasons (for example, squid are more important in winter), perhaps due to seasonal variation in their availability.

In 1939, Alan Lloyd Hodgkin returned from the USA {{to take up a}} fellowship at Trinity College, and Huxley became one of his postgraduate students. Hodgkin was interested in the transmission of electrical signals along nerve fibres. Beginning in 1935 in Cambridge, he had made preliminary measurements on frog sciatic nerves suggesting that the accepted view of the nerve as a simple, elongated battery was flawed. Hodgkin invited Huxley to join him researching the problem. The work was experimentally challenging. One major problem was that the small size of most neurons made it extremely difficult to study them using the techniques of the time. They overcame this by working at the Marine Biological Association laboratory in Plymouth using the giant axon of the <b>longfin</b> inshore <b>squid</b> (Doryteuthis (formerly Loligo) pealeii), which have the largest neurons known. The experiments were still extremely challenging as the nerve impulses only last a fraction of a millisecond, during which time they needed to measure the changing electrical potential at different points along the nerve. Using equipment largely of their own construction and design, including one of the earliest applications of a technique of electrophysiology known as the voltage clamp, they were able to record ionic currents. In 1939, they jointly published a short paper in Nature reporting on the work done in Plymouth and announcing their achievement of recording action potentials from inside a nerve fibre.|$|R
40|$|Cephalopods provide forage to a {{wide range}} of predators in marine food-webs. Despite their {{ecological}} importance, a basic understanding of the mechanisms controlling predation risk and demand is lacking. This is true of one of the most common species of squid found in the northwest Atlantic, the <b>longfin</b> inshore <b>squid</b> (Loligo pealeii). In this dissertation, I address this shortcoming by investigating the role that size and behavior play in influencing squid’s vulnerability to predation. ^ I used long-term food habits, population survey, and commercial landings data, to quantify size-based patterns of predation respective to 25 species of predators. Additionally, I estimated the amount of overlap between predatory consumption and the fishery catch for squid by size. I found that finfish and elasmobranchs generally consumed juvenile and sub-adult squid, while marine mammals primarily targeted adults. Consequently, marine mammals had the highest overlap with the fishing industry for squid size resources. Although large squid were not common in predator diets, predators did not appear to be gape-limited when feeding on squid. This suggested that other factors, including behavior, were important in shaping size-based patterns of predation. ^ I used a laboratory-based approach to quantify attack and capture behaviors towards squid by two predators representing contrasting foraging tactics. Bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) and summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) were chosen as cruising and ambush predators, respectively. Patterns in attack rates suggested that size-selection on squid was constrained by passive processes rather than active choice in both predators. Size-dependent profitability functions were calculated by combining capture success rates, handling times, and relative prey mass, and determined that bluefish was the more efficient predator of squid. Lastly, I evaluated the occurrence and effectiveness of anti-predator responses used by squid in the presence of bluefish and flounder. Squid behavior depended on the type of predator present, and the survival value of primary and secondary defense behaviors differed during interactions with each predator. ^ The results of this project are intended to improve the quality of management of squid and their predators by providing a better understanding of predator-prey interactions in the northwest Atlantic. ...|$|R
