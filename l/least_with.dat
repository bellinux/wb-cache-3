5|$|As of August 27, 2017, 115 golden point {{games have}} been played, with 14 {{remaining}} a draw after the {{ten minutes of}} golden point extra-time. Johnathan Thurston has scored the winning points on four occasions, more {{than anyone in the}} NRL. Clinton Schifcofske, Chris Sandow, Trent Hodkinson, Cooper Cronk, Josh Reynolds and Daly Cherry-Evans have each scored the winning points on three occasions. Todd Carney, Jarrod Sammut, Luke Burt, Luke Walsh, Darren Lockyer, Stacey Jones and Mitchell Pearce have also achieved the feat more than once. The Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks have played the most golden point games with 18 in total, while Manly-Warringah have played the <b>least</b> <b>with</b> eleven.

5|$|Computer science {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the automatic processing of information (or at <b>least</b> <b>with</b> physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned) by means of such things as computers. From the beginning, computer programmers {{have been able to}} develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It is not clear whether computers could be said to have a mind. Could they, someday, come to have what we call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).|$|E
5|$|Life {{expectancy}} in India is at 68 years, {{with life}} expectancy for women being 69.6 years and for men being 67.3. There are around 50 physicians per 100,000 Indians. The number of Indians living {{in urban areas}} has grown by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001. Yet, in 2001, over 70% lived in rural areas. The level of urbanisation increased from 27.81% in 2001 Census to 31.16% in 2011 Census. The slowing down of the overall growth rate of population {{was due to the}} sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since 1991. According to the 2011 census, there are 53 million-plus urban agglomerations in India; among them Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, in decreasing order by population. The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among females and 82.14% among males. The rural urban literacy gap which was 21.2 percentage points in 2001, dropped to 16.1 percentage points in 2011. The improvement in literacy rate in rural area is two times that in urban areas. Kerala is the most literate state with 93.91% literacy; while Bihar the <b>least</b> <b>with</b> 63.82%.|$|E

5|$|Willow bark {{preparations}} {{became a}} standard {{part of the}} materia medica of Western medicine beginning at <b>least</b> <b>with</b> the Greek physician Hippocrates in the fifth century BC; he recommended chewing on willow bark to relieve pain or fever, and drinking tea made from it to relieve pain during childbirth. The Roman encyclopedist Celsus, in his De Medicina of ca. 30 AD, suggested willow leaf extract to treat the four signs of inflammation: redness, heat, swelling and pain. Willow treatments also appeared in Dioscorides's De Materia Medica, and Pliny the Elder's Natural History. By the time of Galen, willow was commonly used throughout the Roman and Arab worlds, as {{a small part of}} a large, growing botanical pharmacopoeia.|$|E
5|$|The {{first century}} in the {{championship}} was scored by Dennis Amiss of England when he made 137 against India in the 1975 World Cup. The same day New Zealand's Glenn Turner scored 171 not out against East Africa. It remained the highest individual total {{over the next two}} editions until Indian cricketer Kapil Dev scored 175 not out against Zimbabwe in 1983. Following that, the record was broken successively by Viv Richards (181) in 1987, Gary Kirsten (188 not out) in 1996, Chris Gayle (215) and Martin Guptill (237 not out) both in 2015. India cricketer Sachin Tendulkar holds the record for the highest number of centuries with six, followed by Australia's Ricky Ponting and Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara with five each. Mark Waugh, Sourav Ganguly, Mahela Jayawardene, AB de Villiers and Tillakaratne Dilshan are joint-third with four centuries. Three players have scored three centuries in a single tournament– Waugh, Ganguly, and Matthew Hayden– in 1996, 2003, 2007 respectively, while Sangakkara made four consecutive centuries in the 2015 World Cup. Ireland's Kevin O'Brien recorded the fastest century when he reached the figure in 50 balls, against England in the 2011 World Cup. In 1992, Andy Flower of Zimbabwe– making his ODI debut in a World Cup– scored a century. In the 2015 tournament, 38 centuries were scored, making it the highest number in a single tournament, while the 1979 competition had the <b>least</b> <b>with</b> two.|$|E
