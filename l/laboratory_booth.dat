40|$|PATHOGENICITY of Clostridium botulinum type-A spores in vivo {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied in our <b>laboratory</b> (<b>Booth,</b> Suzuki and Grecz, 1971 a; Suzuki et al., 1971) and by others (Coleman and Meyer, 1922; Starin and Dack, 1925; Keppie, 1951). When spores of Cl. botulinum type A are introduced into the peritoneal cavity of experimental animals, they are engulfed by macrophages and polymorphonuclear (PMN) leucocytes and they then germinate (Booth, Suzuki and Grecz, 1971 b). In in-vitro studies, spores of CZ. botulinum {{have been shown to}} germinate and to release spore-bound toxin within 8 hr in guinea-pig leucocyte systems (Suzuki, Booth and Grecz, 1970). Although botulism is primarily regarded {{as the result of the}} ingestion of preformed toxin, it may be argued that the unexplained delay in the appearance of symptoms in some cases might be attributable to the delayed release of cell-bound toxin. Ingestion of sublethal amounts of Cl. botulinum spores, vegetative cells, or toxin in contaminated food, or growth of Cl. botulinum in the gastrointestinal tract or in wounds, may subject the host to minute quantities of toxin, but it is unlikely that significant amounts of antitoxin would arise in the host in this way, since the immunising dose is probably much greater than the lethal dose. The presence of spores in the host has been reported in cases of botulinal food poisoning (Coleman and Meyer) and wound infections (Davis, Mattma...|$|E

He was forced to take an extended vacation to Europe in 1856, and again in 1867/1868. He died suddenly {{of a heart attack}} on 12 October 1872 the day after the new university building had been inaugurated in West Philadelphia.|$|R

5000|$|The {{site was}} {{initially}} explored in the 1930s by Jorge Acosta. He was {{only able to}} examine {{the ends of the}} large ball court. He speculated that the constructions at this site were ceremonial and defensive in nature, constructed in the 7th to 9th centuries to protect a growing Monte Alban. Formal excavation was not considered for the site until recently due to its distance from the main Monte Alban site. The site is still being excavated with plans to open it to the public in 2012. Starting in 2010, work has intensified in building the infrastructure needed for the Santa Maria Atzompa archeological site, to be opened to the public in 2012 as an adjunct to the Monte Alban site. A <b>laboratory</b> and security <b>booths</b> have been built, paid for by the INAH. The laboratory is for the testing and dating of ceramic pieces and other artifacts. Walking paths are being constructed by the state government. The archeological work displaced about 100 people from their homes, but the promise of tourism in the future has satisfied the community. [...] As of November 2012 this site is open to the public.|$|R
40|$|Local exhaust {{ventilation}} system (LEV’s) is an engineering safety devices {{used to control}} hazardous airborne contaminant exposure to an acceptable limit. This study was performed to establish performance test method to determine performance of LEV’s. The LEV’s have potential to loss it performance if does not inspected and maintain regularly. Inadequate control of airborne contaminant in the workplace especially in enclosed space may cause poor and deterioration of lung. A significant configuration and regular documentation of current condition of exhaust system related to process involve is helpful to let management detect malfunction {{of the system and}} performing upgrading process. The outcome of this study helpful to make LEV’s user perform an inspection and maintenance of current employed LEV’s. There are 11 <b>laboratories</b> fume <b>booth</b> (LFB) in UTHM was assessed following recommended procedure and guidelines as in BS 5726, BS 7258, ASHRAE 110 : 1995, ACGIH and DOSH. From the result, inconstant face velocities was found when sash window open at different height at all measured LFB’s. Throughout tracer gas test, application of LFB during operation can reduce 50 - 60 % concentration of CO 2. A statistical analysis result shows only face velocity data have significant relationship with IP with r > 0. 5 at all dynamic test. From the regression analysis, {{it was found that the}} most significant relationship between IP and FV is when data measured at full sash height with r = 0. 757. The equation consist of FV to determine IP value was developed by considering 100 % sash height as standard measurement of face velocity of LFB. The equation then executed in LEV’s Smart Tools Analysis provided with new developed pocket guideline as in Appendix G and H. Meanwhile result for FES 1, FES 2 and FES 3 shows that proper usage of duct hood contribute to efficiency of exhaust system. For sustainable inspection and maintenance of LEV’s, it is recommended to do further research about development of analysis tool which able to record measured data in report format provided with graph analysis according to type of contaminant and process involve...|$|R
