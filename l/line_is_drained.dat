50|$|The St. Joseph River {{is a major}} {{geographical}} feature, flowing mostly {{north and}} west through the county from Niles to its mouth on Lake Michigan at St. Joseph. The southwest of the county is drained by the Galien River and its tributaries. Paw Paw Lake is {{in the north of}} the county, along with the Paw Paw River, which flows into the St. Joseph River just before it enters Lake Michigan. A tiny portion along the Indiana state <b>line</b> <b>is</b> <b>drained</b> by small tributaries of the Kankakee River, which ultimately flows into the Mississippi River. This {{is one of the few}} areas of Michigan drained by the Mississippi River, the other being an area of Michigan's Upper Peninsula near the Wisconsin border.|$|E
5000|$|The {{additional}} {{expense of}} leak prevention devices (LPDs) or check valves are recommended to be fitted at each watering distribution point along {{the system to}} insure even distribution of water.

40|$|Percutaneous {{aortic valve}} replaceme r b, 1 mi ersity ospita sity o ersity f Mun 10; ac selec y, the mod European Journal of Cardio-thoracic Susutured into a porcine annulus (N = 9). Both {{coronary}} arteries were separated and each was anastomized to a silicon <b>line,</b> which <b>was</b> <b>drained</b> {{off into a}} measuring beaker. Then valvuloplasty was performed (Thyshak II, 20 mm, 1. 5 atm). After removal of the balloon, 100 ml of sodium chloride solution irrigated the ascending aorta. After passing through the separated coronary arteries, the solution was filtered (filter size 0. 45 mm), dried, and {{the total amount of}} particles was analyzed microscopically. Results: Nine experiments were analyzed. After valvuloplasty, all hearts showed a median of 18 particles larger than 1 mm in the coronary arteries (range 0 — 307). The amount of particles smaller than 1 mm was 6574 (median, range 2207 — 14200). In five cases, coronary arteries were completely occluded by bulky particles. Conclusion: This study demonstrated a large amount of calcific particles after valvuloplasty with a consequently high risk for coronary embolic events in case of highly calcified aortic valves. In times of valvuloplasty rediscovering as part of transcatheter valve implantation, the risk of embolization should be taken into consideration and filtering techniques have to be developed...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Valvuloplasty of the {{aortic valve}} is {{currently}} used in selected patients for severe calcified aortic valve disease, but clinical effectiveness {{is low and}} complication rate remains high. In this study, the total particle load after valvuloplasty and the embolization risk of calcific debris into the coronary arteries was analyzed in an in vitro model. Methods: Three highly calcified human aortic leaflets have been sutured into a porcine annulus (N= 9). Both coronary arteries were separated and each was anastomized to a silicon <b>line,</b> which <b>was</b> <b>drained</b> off into a measuring beaker.

30|$|The {{screening}} for submergence tolerance {{was carried out}} in Nepal (Hardinath, Nepalgunj) and India (Faizabad, Madhepura, Dhangain, Patna). The protocol for the {{screening for}} submergence tolerance was as described in Dixit et al. (2017). Selected NILs were planted in the nursery beds along with Swarna, Swarna-Sub 1 and susceptible check IR 42. The field was submerged for about two weeks from 14 [*]days after seeding (DAS) to 27 [*]days after seeding and then field <b>was</b> <b>drained.</b> The final recovery was recorded seven days after draining (Dixit et al. 2017). The tolerance to submergence was recorded on 1 – 9 scale of increasing order of susceptibility based on the standard evaluation system for submergence tolerance (IRRI 2002). In dry season, the submergence screening was conducted in a concrete tank facility. The selected <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> seeded in the seeding trays and at 14 DAS the trays were submerged along with IR 42. The concrete tanks <b>were</b> <b>drained</b> on 30 DAS depending upon the survival of IR 42, the susceptible check. The numbers of seedlings survived per <b>line</b> <b>were</b> recorded before submergence and at 2, 7, 14, and 21 [*]days after draining the tanks, and percentage survival was calculated (Dixit et al. 2017). Survival percentage[*]=[*](number of seedling survived after submergence/total number of seedlings planted)* 100.|$|R
