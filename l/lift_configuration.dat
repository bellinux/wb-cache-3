Preliminary design of the wing was influenced by both cruise and low speed considerations. The aft-mounted engine location was selected after extensive analysis and design iterations considering aerodynamic, structural, and ground clearance requirements. Airfoil geometry was developed to maximum sweep benefit from the selected planform. [...] The interference problem at the wing-body juncture was treated by modification of the airfoil shape and thickness over the inner third of the wing span. The basic airfoils for the main area of the wing {{are similar to those}} of the Grumman A-6 Intruder aircraft and utilize NACA 6-series thickness distributions combined with an in-house mean line. A buffet boundary commensurate with the M=.85 speed capability was attained by incorporating a row of co-rotating vortex generators on the outer wing panel. In developing the wing contours, attention was paid to the aircraft's low speed requirements by tailoring the leading edge radius to preclude leading edge separation.

In order to validate the CFD code prediction capability of high <b>lift</b> <b>configuration</b> of swept wing with high aspect ratio, AIAA held two workshops of CFD high lift prediction in 2010 and 2012.

Based on the published work of the 1 st and 2 nd high lift prediction workshop, some numerical simulation research to validate the rationality of mesh generation are done in this paper. The two configurations of NASA Trapwing and DLR F- 11 are simulated by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navior-Stokes equations with the S-A turbulence model. The numerical data in linear region agree very well with the experiments but the discrepancy between numerical data and experiment data near the stall region is perceptible.
