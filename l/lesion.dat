5|$|A bypass {{platform}} is provided to these polymerases by Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Under normal circumstances, PCNA bound to polymerases replicates the DNA. At {{a site of}} <b>lesion,</b> PCNA is ubiquitinated, or modified, by the RAD6/RAD18 proteins to provide a platform for the specialized polymerases to bypass the <b>lesion</b> and resume DNA replication. After translesion synthesis, extension is required. This extension {{can be carried out}} by a replicative polymerase if the TLS is error-free, {{as in the case of}} Pol η, yet if TLS results in a mismatch, a specialized polymerase is needed to extend it; Pol ζ. Pol ζ is unique in that it can extend terminal mismatches, whereas more processive polymerases cannot. So when a <b>lesion</b> is encountered, the replication fork will stall, PCNA will switch from a processive polymerase to a TLS polymerase such as Pol ι to fix the <b>lesion,</b> then PCNA may switch to Pol ζ to extend the mismatch, and last PCNA will switch to the processive polymerase to continue replication.|$|E

30|$|Subtle endometriosis is scored {{separately}} from typical <b>lesions.</b> By pathology, they are different, the former being active <b>lesions,</b> {{the latter being}} burnt-out <b>lesions.</b> Subtle <b>lesions</b> in contrast with typical <b>lesions</b> are not associated with the LUF syndrome while no data indicate today that subtle <b>lesions</b> cause pain or infertility. Another important argument to score subtle <b>lesions</b> separately is that typical <b>lesions</b> are readily recognized during laparoscopy, whereas the recognition of subtle <b>lesions</b> varies with the expertise and the scrutiny of the surgeon. A separate classification will permit to evaluate whether subtle <b>lesions</b> are clinically important for pain, infertility, progression, and most importantly whether subtle <b>lesions</b> predict more severe <b>lesions</b> in the future. For the patient, it indeed would be important to know whether subtle <b>lesions</b> herald the onset of more severe <b>lesions</b> or whether they should be considered less important.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND A {{multitude}} of <b>lesions</b> {{occur in the}} neck and patients come to hospital on account of morbidity associated with these <b>lesions.</b> Therefore a histopathological study of the spectrum of neck <b>lesions</b> was undertaken. MATERIALS AND METHODS All histologically diagnosed <b>lesions</b> of the neck from January 2014 to December 2015 were noted. Details of gender, age, location and diagnosis were recorded. The <b>lesions</b> were classified based on anatomic location, gross and histological features and clinically. Clinically, <b>lesions</b> were classified as congenital, inflammatory/infective and neoplastic. Incidence of age, gender and location of different <b>lesions</b> was calculated using percentage, and median. The findings were compared with other studies. RESULTS A total of 140 neck <b>lesions</b> {{were included in the}} current study. Neck <b>lesions</b> were predominant in females with 94 cases. The median age group involved was the 21 - 30 group. Anterior neck <b>lesions</b> were more common. Anterior midline <b>lesions</b> were 74 and mostly thyroid and thyroglossal duct origin. <b>Lesions</b> of the lymph node were greater in the posterior triangle. 122 <b>lesions</b> were solid and 18 were cystic. Histologically, there were 64 thyroid gland <b>lesions,</b> 40 lymph node <b>lesions,</b> 13 soft tissue tumours, 8 salivary <b>lesions,</b> 10 thyroglossal cysts and 5 skin/adnexal <b>lesions.</b> Clinically, congenital/developmental <b>lesions</b> were 11, inflammatory/infective <b>lesions</b> were 68 and neoplastic <b>lesions</b> were 61. Of the neoplastic <b>lesions,</b> 17 were malignant. CONCLUSION Non-neoplastic <b>lesions</b> of the neck were common in our study in accordance with findings in other studies.

40|$|AbstractDirectional {{coronary}} atherectomy, a new transluminal {{procedure for}} treatment of obstructive <b>lesions</b> in coronary arteries by excision and removal of tissue, was performed on 447 <b>lesions</b> in 382 procedures. Successful outcome, defined as a reduction of stenosis by ≥ 20 % with a 80 % and the combined atherectomy and angioplasty success rate was > 90 % for complex morphologic features such as eccentric <b>lesions,</b> lengthy <b>lesions,</b> <b>lesions</b> with abnormal contour, angulated <b>lesions,</b> ostial <b>lesions</b> and <b>lesions</b> with branch involvement. In the presence of calcific deposition, atherectomy success rate was 52 % for primary <b>lesions</b> and 83 % for restenosed <b>lesions.</b> Among angiographically complex <b>lesions,</b> calcium was the predictor for failed atherectomy (p < 0. 0001). In summary, directional coronary atherectomy is safe and effective {{for treatment of}} obstructive <b>lesions</b> in coronary arteries in selected cases. In particular, it achieves a high success rate in <b>lesions</b> with complex morphologic characteristics, such as eccentricity, abnormal contour and ostial involvement...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} is to present an {{analysis}} of orbital <b>lesions</b> by classifying them ac-cording to the site of origin in patients of all ages presenting at a tertiary care eye hospital from 1996 till 2012. Methods: 1637 patients were initially enrolled in this descriptive case series. Clin-ical data of 1246 patients who completed the study during 17 years were analyzed. Orbital <b>lesions</b> of the patients were examined and managed medically or surgically as per requirement. The his-topathological reports of these patients were used to classify the <b>lesions.</b> Results: Out of all cases 54. 57 % (n = 680) were neoplastic and 45. 42 % (n = 566) were nonneoplastic <b>lesions.</b> Amongst the neoplastic <b>lesions</b> 86. 17 % (n = 586) were malignant and 13. 82 % (n = 94) were benign. Primary orbital <b>lesions</b> were the most common orbital <b>lesions</b> being 963 (77. 29 %) followed by secondary orbital <b>lesions</b> being 232 (18. 62 %), hematopoietic reticuloendothelial being 47 (3. 77 %) and me-tastatic <b>lesions</b> being 04 (0. 32 %). Conclusion: Orbital <b>lesions</b> are more common in adults as com-pared to children. Neoplastic <b>lesions</b> are more common than nonneoplastic <b>lesions,</b> and amongst the neoplastic <b>lesions</b> malignant <b>lesions</b> are more common than benign ones.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) {{visibility of}} magnetic resonance (MR) <b>lesions.</b> METHODS: Data from 34 patients with 56 MR <b>lesions</b> and prostatectomy were used.

RESULTS: TRUS visibility occurred in 43 % of all MR <b>lesions</b> and in 62 % of PIRADS 5 <b>lesions.</b> Visible <b>lesions</b> {{had a significantly}} lower localization variability. On prostatectomy, 58 % of the TRUS-visible <b>lesions</b> had a Gleason 4 or 5 component. CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of the MR <b>lesions</b> were visible on TRUS.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The precise {{clinical}} {{characteristics of}} acute encephalopathy with bilat-eral reduced diffusion {{are not fully}} understood. We compared clinical, laboratory, and neuroimaging findings according to the patterns of brain <b>lesions</b> among children with reduced diffusion in the bilateral hemispheres. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine patients were analyzed. The patterns of brain <b>lesions</b> were divided into diffuse <b>lesions</b> and central-sparing <b>lesions.</b> Diffuse <b>lesions</b> were defined as reduced diffusion in the whole cortex and/or subcortical white matter. Central-sparing <b>lesions</b> were defined as the lack of reduced diffusion in the areas around the bilateral Sylvian fissures. Clinical, laboratory, and neuroim-aging findings were compared between groups. RESULTS: Five patients showed diffuse <b>lesions</b> and 4 showed central-sparing <b>lesions.</b> Coma was significantly more common in patients with diffuse <b>lesions,</b> whereas a biphasic clinical course was more common in those with central-sparing <b>lesions.</b> Outcome was worse in patients with diffuse <b>lesions.</b> Maximal aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and kinase levels were also significantly higher in patients with diffuse <b>lesions.</b> In 2 patients with diffuse <b>lesions,</b> diffusion-weighted images during the acute phase revealed reduced diffusion in the bilateral frontal and occipita...|$|R

In many species (for example, L. major) the <b>lesion</b> often spontaneously heals with atrophic scarring. In some species (for example, L. braziliensis) the <b>lesion</b> may spontaneously heal with scarring, but then reappear elsewhere (especially as destructive mucocutaneous lesions).
