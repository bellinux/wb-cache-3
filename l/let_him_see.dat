Oliver has Barry perform a {{paternity}} test on William and it confirms that Oliver is William's father. Confronting Samantha, she agrees to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>see</b> William on the condition he tell no one, including William himself, {{that he is the}} boy's father. Felicity learns of Oliver's paternity and feels betrayed because Oliver is still willing to keep secrets from her, so she ends their relationship.|$|E
5|$|At Elizabeth's first {{interrogation}} session, the Japanese {{told her}} that some ships had been sunk in the harbour {{and they wanted to}} know the location of a large amount of money. She claimed no knowledge of the matter but was repeatedly interrogated and beaten. At various times, the Kempeitai forced Elizabeth to kneel on some angled bars of wood on the floor. They stripped her topless and tied her to the wood so she could not go either forwards or backwards. Then they applied electric shocks to her. They even brought in her husband to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>see</b> her being tortured. After nine months in captivity, Elizabeth had lost half her body weight.|$|E
25|$|Ichihachi is an {{entertainer}} at a geisha house and professes {{his devotion to}} Ume, one of the geisha. After he falls off the roof because of a stunt, Ume offers to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>see</b> her, though warning him to not drink so he remembers. Later, a patron asks for his services and Ichihachi ends up going home drunk anyway and oversleeps.|$|E

25|$|Belbo goes to Agliè privately and {{describes}} The Plan {{to him as}} though it were the result of serious research. He also claims to be in possession of the secret Templar map. Agliè becomes frustrated with Belbo's refusal to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>see</b> this (non-existent) map. He frames Belbo as a terrorist suspect in order to force him to come to Paris. Agliè has cast himself as the head of a secret spiritual brotherhood, which includes Mr. Garamond, Colonel Ardenti and many of the Diabolical authors. Belbo tries to get help from De Angelis, but he has just transferred to Sardinia after an attempted car bombing, and refuses to get involved.|$|E
25|$|Woodwind and harp {{accompany}} a pensive {{version of}} the 'Dmitriy Motif'. The Pretender dreams of an assignation with Marina {{in the garden of}} her father's castle. However, to his annoyance, Rangoni finds him. He brings news that Marina longs for him and wishes to speak with him. The Pretender resolves to throw himself at Marina's feet, begging her to be his wife and Tsaritsa. He entreats Rangoni to lead him to Marina. Rangoni, however, first begs the Pretender to consider him a father, allowing him to follow his every step and thought. Despite his mistrust of Rangoni, the Pretender agrees not to part from him if he will only <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>see</b> Marina. Rangoni convinces the Pretender to hide as the Polish nobles emerge from the castle dancing a polonaise (Polonaise). Marina flirts, dancing with an older man. The Poles sing of taking the Muscovite throne, defeating the army of Boris, and capturing him. They return to the castle. The Pretender comes out of hiding, cursing Rangoni. He resolves to abandon wooing Marina and begin his march on Moscow. But then Marina appears and calls to him. He is lovesick. She, however, only wants to know when he will be Tsar, and declares she can only be seduced by a throne and a crown. The Pretender kneels at her feet. She rejects his advances, and, attempting to spur him to action, dismisses him, calling him a lackey. Having reached his limit, he tells her he will depart the next day to lead his army to Moscow and to his father's throne. Furthermore, as Tsar he will take pleasure in watching her come crawling back looking for her own lost throne, and will command everyone to laugh at her. She quickly reverses course, tells him she adores him, and they sing a duet ("O Tsarevich, I implore you"). Rangoni observes the amorous couple from afar, and, joining them in a brief trio, cynically rejoices in his victory.|$|E
500|$|Mr. Samukai also {{complains}} {{that he feels}} sidelined from {{the formation of an}} army that, as defense minister, he is supposed to oversee. Neither the State Department nor DynCorp will <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>see</b> the company's contract, for instance. And the U.S. insists that instead of talking directly to DynCorp managers, he go through Major Wyatt [...] on all matters related to the training.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Marshall {{was very}} proud of his son's success in college, but he had no {{intention}} of <b>letting</b> <b>him</b> <b>see</b> it. He loved this boy of his, with the dead mother's eyes, better than anything on earth, and all his hopes and ambitions were bound up in him.|$|R
5000|$|Next, Bugs saws {{a circle}} around Rocky's chair, only <b>letting</b> <b>him</b> <b>see</b> the tool near the end. Bugs then slips it into Mugsy's hands and hides, while Rocky shoots wildly and confronts Mugsy with some hitting while screaming, [...] "I don't know how ya's done it, but I know ya's done it!!!".|$|R
500|$|Lee {{was also}} arrested but was {{released}} without charge {{after two days}} when the investigation cleared him of any involvement in Lody's espionage. He complained about his treatment and the British authorities' refusal to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>see</b> an American consul, and promised to take the matter up with the US State Department on his return. An [...] officer named R.H. Price smoothed things over with him on his release on 4 October, explaining what had prompted his arrest and paying his fare back to his hotel. Price reported, [...] "I think he was quite soothed and he shook hands with me on parting." [...] Lee was unaware {{that the police had}} already recommended that both he and [...] "Inglis" [...] should be court-martialled and shot if found guilty.|$|E
500|$|Momolo {{set out for}} Rome {{again on}} 11 October 1858, this time {{bringing}} Marianna {{with him in the}} hope that her presence might make a stronger impression on the Church and Edgardo. Anxious about the possible consequences of a dramatic reunification between mother and son, the rector Enrico Sarra took Edgardo from Rome to Alatri, his [...] own home town about [...] away. The Mortaras tracked them to a church in Alatri, where from the door Momolo saw a priest saying mass—and Edgardo by his side assisting him. Momolo waited outside, and afterwards persuaded the rector to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>see</b> his son. Before this meeting could take place, the Mortaras were arrested on the orders of the Mayor of Alatri, himself following a request from the town's bishop, and despatched back to Rome. Antonelli was not impressed, thinking this an undignified line of action that would give obvious ammunition to the Church's detractors, and ordered Sarra to bring Edgardo back to the capital to meet his parents.|$|E
500|$|As {{surveys were}} still in {{progress}} Darwin set off on another [...] "galloping" [...] trip in Banda Oriental to see the Uruguay River and visit the Estancia of Mr Keen near Mercedes on the Río Negro. On 25November he [...] "heard of some giants bones, which as usual {{turned out to be}} those of the Megatherium" [...] but could only extract a few broken fragments, then on the next day visited a nearby house and bought for about two shillings [...] "a head of a Megatherium which must have been when found quite perfect", though the teeth had since been broken and the lower jaw had been lost. Mr Keen arranged to ship the skull down river to Buenos Aires. At Las Piedras a clergyman <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>see</b> fossils including a club-like tail which he sketched and called an [...] "extraordinary weapon". His notes included a page showing his realisation that the cliff banks of the rivers exposed two strata formed in an estuary interrupted by an undersea stratum, indicating that the land had risen and fallen.|$|E

2500|$|Lewis {{said after}} the fight [...] "Bruno did his {{homework}} and kept me from throwing my right hand early... but he must have forgotten I have a terrific left hook. I said to myself, 'I'm going to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>see</b> my hook'". Bruno's manager, Mickey Duff, said [...] "Frank (Bruno) has no chin... once he gets hit clean on the button, he goes".|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Simlai deduced from [...] {{that one}} should always first praise God at the {{beginning}} of prayer, for Moses praised God in [...] before he asked God in [...] to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>see</b> the good land. Rabbi Eleazar deduced from [...] that God let Moses see the Promised Land only because Moses prayed, and thus Rabbi Eleazar concluded that prayer is more effective than good deeds, for no one was greater in good deeds than Moses, and yet God let Moses see the land only after Moses prayed.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Encyclical {{follows the}} lines of the {{traditional}} teaching concerning the rights and duties of property and the relations of employer and employee, it applies the old doctrines specifically to modern conditions. Leo first quotes Thomas Aquinas in affirming that private property is a fundamental principle of natural law. He then quotes Gregory the Great regarding its proper use: [...] ""He that hath a talent, <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>see</b> that he hide it not; he that hath abundance, let him quicken himself to mercy and generosity; he that hath art and skill, let him do his best to share the use and the utility hereof with his neighbor." [...] Liberalism also affirms the right to private property, but socialism and communism do not.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the second}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Jacob's sight had dimmed with age, so Joseph brought his sons near, and Jacob kissed them and embraced them. Jacob told Joseph {{that he had}} not thought to see his face, and now God had <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>see</b> his children, as well. Joseph took them from between his knees, bowed deeply, and brought them to Jacob, with Ephraim in his right hand toward Jacob's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Jacob's right hand. But Jacob laid his right hand on Ephraim, the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh, the firstborn, and prayed that God bless the lads, let Jacob's name be named in them, and let them grow into a multitude. The second reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
2500|$|He spent {{a seven-year}} period on a {{houseboat}} called Mona with Helen Torr, known as [...] "Reds" [...] for the fiery {{color of her}} hair. Torr was also a painter. Although the psychological consequences benefited Dove’s art, his life with Torr was difficult. Florence Dove never cared about Dove's passion for art, and was more socially inclined. After 25 years of marriage, Dove left Florence. Florence would not grant him a divorce and flatly refused to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>see</b> his son. When he departed, he left behind everything except his copies of Camera Work and Stieglitz’s letters. When Dove’s wife Florence died unexpectedly, he paid $250.00 for the funeral expenses and sent flowers, but {{did not go to}} the funeral in Geneva. Although distressed about her death, he was now able to see his son and marry Torr. For the first time in eight years, Dove met with his then nineteen-year-old son, Bill, who was also an artist. The two established a friendship and later in life his son became a help to Dove with creating a technique for silvering frames. Dove and Torr were not able to wed immediately as Torr had not divorced her first husband. Dove and Torr did eventually marry on April 1932 in the New York City Hall with a brief service and using a ten-cent store ring. Dove identified himself as a [...] "frame maker" [...] on his marriage registry. The 1933 Gallery 291 exhibition was the only time Stieglitz allowed Torr and Dove to exhibit together. [...] "Seven Americans" [...] brought Dove back into the coverage of major newspapers and art magazines, as well as back into the public eye. Dove's work influenced later abstract landscape painters, such as Hatton and O'Keeffe, in terms of having an [...] "unbridled love of pure, hot color." ...|$|E
