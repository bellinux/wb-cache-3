5000|$|In a {{reference}} to the Lotophagi, there is an area on the Penelope quest called [...] "Land Of The Lotus Eaters". Approaching one of the chests in this area causes the hero, always out of curiosity, to consume the nearby <b>lotus</b> <b>fruit</b> instead of taking the treasure, transforming the victim permanently into a mindless non-player character.|$|E
50|$|A {{promontory}} {{jutting out}} into the sea from the country of the Gindanes is inhabited by the lotus-eaters, who live entirely on {{the fruit of the}} lotus-tree. The <b>lotus</b> <b>fruit</b> {{is about the size of}} the lentisk berry and in sweetness resembles the date. The lotus-eaters even succeed in obtaining from it a sort of wine.Polybius identifies the land of the lotus-eaters as the island of Djerba (ancient Meninx), off the coast of Tunisia. Later this identification is supported by Strabo.|$|E
5000|$|In Greek mythology the lotus-eaters (λωτοφάγοι, lōtophagoi), also {{referred}} to as the lotophagi or lotophaguses (singular lotophagus [...] ) or lotophages (singular lotophage [...] ), were a race of people living on an island dominated by lotus plants. The <b>lotus</b> <b>fruits</b> and flowers were the primary food of the island and were a narcotic, causing the inhabitants to sleep in peaceful apathy.|$|R
50|$|On {{the banks}} of the river, the golden swan spends some time singing and dancing, eating <b>lotus</b> <b>fruits</b> and then rests on a lotus leaf. Nalan observes that swan of {{exquisite}} beauty during his wandering in the garden distraught in his thoughts about the damsel Damayanthi. He catches the bird unawares in its sleep without disturbing it. The swan, finding itself captured, starts crying loud that the king is killing it. It is worried about its fate and the thought of its old mother, wife and children becoming orphans in its absence. The King says that he had no intentions of hurting it. He only thought of possessing that virtuous and golden bird. He allows the bird to fly away freely. When the bird is gone, Nalan once again falls back into his reverie about Damayanthi.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{explanations}} {{have been}} put forward to explain {{the origin of the}} goddess and the meaning of her name. Older sources speculated that the name is related to the Greek λήθη lḗthē (oblivion) and λωτός <b>lotus</b> (the <b>fruit</b> that brings oblivion to those who eat it). It would thus mean [...] "the hidden one".|$|R
50|$|Consisting of a {{ship that}} also {{simultaneously}} bears the <b>lotus</b> <b>fruit</b> and flower, the Tzu Chi logo symbolizes that {{the world can be}} made a better place by planting good karmic seeds. Followers believe that these seeds are required for flowers bloom and bear fruit, which is a metaphor for their beliefs that a better society can be created with good actions and pure thoughts. The Ship represents Tzu Chi steering a ship of compassion, representing their goal in saving all beings that suffer, while the Eight Petals represent the Noble Eightfold Path in Buddhism, which Tzu Chi uses as their guide.|$|E
40|$|Sacred lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) {{has been}} {{cultivated}} as a crop in Asia {{for thousands of}} years. An � 1300 -yr-old <b>lotus</b> <b>fruit,</b> recovered from an originally cultivated but now dry lakebed in northeastern China, is the oldest germinated and directly 14 C-dated fruit known. In 1996, we traveled to the dry lake at Xipaozi Village, China, {{the source of the}} old viable fruits. We identified all of the landmarks recorded by botanist Ichiro Ohga some 80 yr ago when he first studied the deposit, but found that the fruits are now rare. We (1) cataloged a total of 60 lotus fruits; (2) germinated four fruits having physical ages of 200 – 500 yr by 14 C dating; (3) measured the rapid germination of the old fruits and the initially fast growth and short dormancy of their seedlings; (4) recorded abnormal phenotypes in their leaves, stalks, roots, and rhizomes; (5) determined �-radiation of � 2. 0 mGy/yr in the lotus-bearing beds; and (6) measured stratigraphic sequences of the lakebed strata. The total �-irradiation of the old fruits of 0. 1 – 3 Gy (gray, the unit of absorbed dosage defined as 1 joule/kg; 1 Gy � 100 rad), evidently resulting in certain of the abnormal phenotypes noted in their seedlings, represents the longest natural radiobiology experiment yet recorded. Most of the lotus abnormalities resemble those of chronically irradiated plants exposed to much higher irradiances. Though the chronic exposure of the old fruits to low-dose �-radiation may be responsibl...|$|E
50|$|Certain {{indigenous}} yams colloquially named innala (Lecranthus) and kiri ala (Xanthasoma sagittifolium), underwater {{stems of}} kohila (Lasia spinosa) and nelum ala (Nymphea <b>lotus)</b> and <b>fruits</b> and pods of perennial {{crops such as}} bread fruit, young jak and murunga are foreign exchange spinners of the country. It is the same with special flavored Sri Lankan Pineapple, Mangosteen, ripe jak, avocado, rambutan, star fruit and anoda etc.|$|R
5000|$|Horimono (彫り物, 彫物, {{literally}} carving, engraving), {{also known}} as chōkoku (彫刻, [...] "sculpture"), are the engraved images in the blade of a Japanese sword, which may include katana or tantō blades. The artist is called a chōkokushi (彫刻師), or a horimonoshi (彫物師, [...] "engraver"). There {{are a variety of}} designs, which include kozumi (claws), kusa kurikara (草倶利伽羅) (Arabesque style), Munenagabori (created in Munenaga), rendai (<b>lotus</b> pedastal), <b>fruit,</b> dragons, and many others.|$|R
50|$|The day {{on which}} it is {{traditionally}} eaten {{is commonly known as}} the Laba Festival. The earliest form of this dish was cooked with red beans and has since developed into many different kinds. It is mainly made up of many kinds of rice, beans, peanuts, dried <b>fruit,</b> <b>lotus</b> seeds, etc. Depending on region-based variations in China, it can also include tofu, potato, meat and vegetables.|$|R
5000|$|A {{statue of}} Mae Nak and her infant form the {{centerpiece}} of the shrine. Devotees often make offerings, accompanied by a request for help, generally by women seeking easy childbirth or for their husband to be exempt from military conscription. These are usually lengths of colored cloth, wrapped around the trunk of the Bo tree. Other offerings include <b>fruit,</b> <b>lotuses,</b> and incense sticks left in different locations.|$|R
50|$|Like {{all aspects}} of Ganesha Mahaganapati has an {{elephant}} head. Sindoor, is generally used for his red colour, in depictions. His colour is {{a reference to the}} dawn. He is often depicted with a third eye on his forehead, a crescent moon over his head, ten arms which hold; a <b>lotus,</b> a pomegranate <b>fruit,</b> a gada (mace), a chakra (discus), his own broken tusk, a pasha (noose), a jewelled water vessel or a pot of jewels, a blue lotus, a rice sprig and a sugarcane bow.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to tree and shrub leaves, {{sheep and goats}} consume the seed pods of Robinia pseudoacacia, Acacia modesta and Acacia nilotica in autumn. Diospyros <b>lotus</b> is a <b>fruit</b> tree. However, the leaves are lopped during years of extended summer drought {{at the expense of}} fruit production. The leaves of Aesculus indica are lopped during autumn and dried for feeding during winter. Dodonaea viscosa is a lowland unpalatable shrub. However, the transhumant herders force their sheep and goats to browse these leaves as they are believed to have a de-worming effect. Cotoneaster nummularia and Impatiens bicolor are not only browsed, but also lopped by transhumant herders for feeding the kids and lambs at the barn when the dams are away grazing on pastures.|$|R
6000|$|We {{left our}} young {{stranger}} in France situated more comfortably {{than he had}} found himself since entering the territories of the ancient Gauls. The breakfast, as we hinted in {{the conclusion of the}} last chapter, was admirable. There was a pate de Perigord, over which a gastronome would have wished to live and die, like Homer's lotus eaters [see the Odyssey, chap. ix, where Odysseus arrives at the land of the Lotus eaters: [...] "whosoever of them ate the <b>lotus's</b> honeyed <b>fruit</b> resolved to bring tidings back no more and never to leave the place, but with the Lotus eaters there desired to stay, to feed on lotus and forget his going home." [...] Palmer's Translation.], forgetful of kin, native country, and all social obligations whatever. Its vast walls of magnificent crust seemed raised like the bulwarks of some rich metropolitan city, an emblem of the wealth which they are designed to protect. There was a delicate ragout, with just that petit point de l'ail [a little flavor of garlic. The French is ungrammatical.] which Gascons love, and Scottishmen do not hate. There was, besides, a delicate ham, which had once supported a noble wild boar in the neighbouring wood of Mountrichart. There was the most exquisite white bread, made into little round loaves called boules (whence the bakers took their French name of boulangers), of which the crust was so inviting, that, even with water alone, {{it would have been a}} delicacy. But the water was not alone, for there was a flask of leather called bottrine, which contained about a quart of exquisite Vin de Beaulne. So many good things might have created appetite under the ribs of death. What effect, then, must they have produced upon a youngster of scarce twenty, who (for the truth must be told) had eaten little for the two last days, save the scarcely ripe fruit which chance afforded him an opportunity of plucking, and a very moderate portion of barley bread? He threw himself upon the ragout, and the plate was presently vacant--he attacked the mighty pasty, marched deep into the bowels of the land, and seasoning his enormous meal with an occasional cup of wine, returned to the charge again and again, to the astonishment of mine host, and the amusement of Maitre Pierre.|$|R
