40|$|Purpose – Manufacturing firms {{primarily}} organise <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> internally, externally {{or through}} a hybrid arrangement. This paper aims to analyse how firm-, offering-, and market-specific factors influence {{the way in which}} a firm organise its <b>service</b> <b>provision.</b> In addition, the paper analyses the specific challenges that each organisational arrangement presents for a firm. Design/Methodology/Approach – The study employed a qualitative, multiple-case research design that involved seven manufacturing firms with different organisational arrangements <b>for</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision.</b> Findings – Contrary to certain explicit assumptions, few firms organise <b>for</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> solely through an in-house organisation. Analysis of firms {{in a wide variety of}} industries has shown that the organisational arrangements (internal, external or hybrid configuration) are contingent on factors such as market strategy, customer relationships, product-service linkages, internal competences and market channel characteristics. Research Limitations/Implications – This article is an initial attempt to understand the strategic choices that firms make in terms of inter-organisational arrangements <b>for</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision.</b> The research should be extended by way of a cross-sectional survey in order to test and further validate the importance of the determinants of the organisational arrangements <b>for</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision.</b> Originality/Value – This article contributes to the service marketing and management literature by examining factors that determine whether firms organise <b>for</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> internally, externally {{or through a}} hybrid configuration. Prior research has not explicitly addressed this issue.

40|$|Next Generation Networks (NGNs), as {{envisioned by}} ITU-T, are packet-based networks, capable of {{provisioning}} consistent and ubiquitous services to end-users, {{independently of the}} network, the access technology and the devices used. RESTful Web services are now being contemplated as a technology <b>for</b> <b>service</b> <b>provisioning</b> in NGNs. They are emerging as an alternative, which may be more adequate than SOAPbased Web services in some cases. SOAP-based Web services are modular applications that can be discovered and invoked over a network. RESTful Web services, on the other hand, are defined as a network architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems. This paper presents a survey on RESTful Web <b>services</b> <b>for</b> <b>service</b> <b>provisioning</b> in NGNs. It introduces the concept of RESTful Web services and reviews the state-of-the-art of RESTful-based-service provisioning in NGNs. It also provides {{an evaluation of the}} overall suitability of RESTful Web <b>services</b> <b>for</b> <b>service</b> <b>provisioning</b> in NGNs, and discusses research directions. RESTful Web services do show significant potential <b>for</b> <b>service</b> <b>provisioning</b> in NGNs. However, open issues such as publication/discovery and mechanisms for the development of complex session-based services need to be solved before its full potential can be realized...|$|R

A quantitative model and experimental measurements are performed to compare Java RMI and mobile agents in the special context of software downloading. The results show that significant performance improvements can be obtained using mobile agents. In addition, two agent-based services, namely Service Download and Service Discovery, are proposed to illustrate the benefits of using mobile agents <b>for</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> and their potential impacts on mobile computing environments. 1...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{deregulation}} efforts UMTS envisages the existence of several competing service providers. However, it is very questionable whether the designated concepts of INs will ever provide the required powerful mechanisms needed <b>for</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision,</b> numbering and location management in multi-service-provider environments. The TINA framework addresses problemes like these, but unfortunately, TINA ignores certain aspects of mobile cellular networks. This contribution presents an approach how TINA concepts may be applied for UMTS. According to the TINA business model, it is shown how service providers and brokers may interact <b>for</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> and numbering in mobile networks and how location management functionality is splitted between these two roles. ...|$|R
