50|$|The play {{takes place}} in 1947 England {{in the home of}} Professor Robert Linden, who holds the Chair of Modern History at the provincial University of Burmanley. Rationing and {{austerity}} seem to have fostered opportunism, escapism and confrontation within the <b>Linden</b> <b>family,</b> who have gathered to celebrate Professor Linden's 65th birthday and each of whom is struggling with their own crises. Professor Linden wants only to continue teaching in a world that no longer seems to share his quiet ideals. His family urge him to retire, but he is not so easily deterred.|$|E
5000|$|The large {{flowering}} plant genus Grewia [...] is today placed by most authors in the mallow family Malvaceae, in the expanded sense {{as proposed by}} in the APG. Formerly, it was placed in either the <b>linden</b> <b>family</b> (Tiliaceae) or the Sparrmanniaceae. However, these were both not monophyletic with respect to other Malvales - as already indicated by the uncertainties surrounding placement of Grewia and similar genera - and have thus been merged into the Malvaceae. Together with {{the bulk of the}} former Sparrmanniaceae, Grewia is in the subfamily Grewioideae and therein the tribe Grewieae, of which it is the type genus.|$|E
40|$|The Troubles is {{the most}} {{defining}} conflict {{in the history of}} Northern Ireland. However, as Glenn Patterson suggests, {{it is not the only}} story, and the effects of the Troubles on the lives of individuals is just as important, as it can also be seen in his second novel, Fat Lad (1992). In my thesis I focus on the family history of the Lindens, and its connections to the Troubles. In the first chapter I analyse the roots and effects of the protagonist's, Drew Linden's, trauma. Furthermore, I describe the role of transgenerational trauma in the <b>Linden</b> <b>family's</b> story. In the second chapter, I give an overview of the important factors that play a role in Drew Linden's work-through process, which eventually leads him towards reconciliation. MSc/MAAnglisztik...|$|R

50|$|Colt died August 13, 1921, of {{complications}} from a stroke at <b>Linden</b> Place, the <b>family</b> home in Bristol. A farm owned by Colt was later purchased {{by the state of}} Rhode Island and transformed into Colt State Park.|$|R
5000|$|Burret made {{numerous}} {{travels in}} Europe and Africa, {{as well as}} South America. He was invited by the Brazilian government to make a trip to that country, specifically {{for the study of}} the various species of palm trees indigenous to the region. Shortly after his return to Germany, he voyaged to the Old World tropics, visiting Sri Lanka, the Malay Peninsula, Java, and Sumatra in 1938 and 1939. Burret was among the first botanists to conduct ground-breaking research on palms, beginning in Africa and later in South America and Indomalaysia. He identified, named and classified dozens of palm species, including Rhapis multifida (finger palm) and Livistona beccariana. He also named and classified other tropical flora, chiefly those of the <b>linden</b> <b>family.</b> The names of several genera of palm trees were named after him, including the genera Maxburretia and Burretiokentia.|$|E
50|$|In 1564, a play {{house or}} little castle {{was located in}} the Kwikstraat (name of a local road): the van Grave Court (Dutch: Hof van Grave). The van Grave family (or 'de Grez' family) {{has always been an}} {{important}} noble family, starting during the Middle Ages. Maria-Anna van Grave married Juste-Philibert de Spangen, Baron of Herent. By inheritance, the Counts de Gage and the van der <b>Linden</b> <b>family,</b> Barons d'Hoogvorst, became the rightful owners of the castle. At the end of the 18th century, the building was property of Nicolas Blairon from Frameries in Hainaut. He established a school out of it. In 1886, Jan-Baptist Jossa ‘Tiske de Scheper now settled himself in this homestead. He tended his own sheep, and the sheep of de Merode Castle. The 16th century play house was restorated and was made into a house for two families.|$|E
5000|$|Eric Linden {{was born}} in New York City to Phillip and Elvira (née Lundborg) Linden, both of Swedish descent. His father was a {{professional}} pianist and an actor on stage with the Theater Royal when he lived in Stockholm, Sweden. When Eric was six, Phillip <b>Linden</b> deserted his <b>family</b> in New York City.|$|R
50|$|Rick van der Linden {{was born}} in the village of Badhoevedorp, not far from Amsterdam, the second of five van der <b>Linden</b> children. His <b>family</b> moved when Rick was only 5 weeks old to Rotterdam, where they lived until 1957. He started piano lessons at age 7, but gave them up two years later because he wasn't enjoying them. When he was 11, his family moved again, to Haarlem where van der Linden {{attended}} the Triniteitslyceum. At 13, his father convinced Rick to try the piano again, so he was enrolled at the highly regarded Haarlem School of Music. Two years later he became a private pupil of the famous Haarlem professor, Piet Vincent. At 17, he entered the Haarlem Conservatory where Aad Broersen and Albert de Klerk tutored him in the organ. Van der Linden finished his studies two years later and in 1965 passed exams at the Royal Conservatory in Den Haag, winning honours in piano, organ, harmony and counterpoint. Van der Linden thought he might become a teacher at the Haarlem Conservatory.|$|R
