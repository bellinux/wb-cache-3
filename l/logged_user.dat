Our approach automatically builds statistical models of user sessions and automatically derives test cases from these models. We provide several alternative modeling approaches based on statistical machine learning methods. We investigate {{the effectiveness of the}} test suites generated from our methods by performing a preliminary study that evaluates the generated test cases. The results of this study demonstrate that our techniques are able to generate test cases that achieve high coverage and accurately model user behavior. This study provides insights into improving our methods and motivates a larger study with a more diverse set of applications and testing metrics. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Improving the user’s {{interaction}} {{with a video}} retrieval system requires to examine the search behavior of real users. We present in this article a study comparing the video search behavior between professional archivists and novice users. The comparison focuses on the use and effectiveness of different state-of-the-art video search methods offered by our retrieval system, and the result investigation behavior of the two user groups. We conducted our experiments {{in the context of}} TRECVID’s 2009 interactive search task, using the provided collection and topics for our evaluation. The findings are based on a qualitative questionnaire analysis and a quantitative examination of the <b>logged</b> <b>user</b> actions on the search interface. The experimental results indicate that today’s visual search techniques have improved in effectiveness, confirming a trend found in previous user studies. To our surprise, professional archivists used visual concept search in many of their searches. Queries containing visual concepts were more effective, resulting in more relevant shots found than the alternative methods. Overall, we conclude that professional archivists are more focused on recall in carrying out their search tasks, and are better at reflecting on their own search performance. ...|$|E

40|$|System {{operators}} play {{a critical}} role in maintaining server dependability yet lack powerful tools to help them do so. To help address this unfulfilled need, we describe Operator Undo, a tool that provides a forgiving operations environment by allowing operators to recover from their own mistakes, from unanticipated software problems, and from intentional or accidental data corruption. Operator Undo starts by intercepting and logging user interactions with a network service before they enter the system, creating a record of user intent. During an undo cycle, all system hard state is physically rewound, allowing the operator to perform arbitrary repairs; after repairs are complete, lost user data is reintegrated into the repaired system by replaying the <b>logged</b> <b>user</b> interactions while tracking and compensating for any resulting externally-visible inconsistencies. We describe the design and implementation of an application-neutral framework for Operator Undo, and detail the process by which we instantiated the framework in the form of an undo-capable e-mail store supporting SMTP mail delivery and IMAP mail retrieval. Our proof-of-concept e-mail implementation imposes only a small performance overhead, and can store days or weeks of recovery log on a single disk...|$|E

Desktop electronic document manipulation {{is one of the}} most common activities performed by computer users, yet there remains little empirical research into how documents are used in common document navigation systems. This paper presents a 14 participant, 120 day study that <b>logged</b> <b>user</b> actions in Microsoft Word and Adobe Reader, with the aim of char-acterising document use. The study found that Microsoft Word documents are likely to be significantly shorter but have longer pe-riods of interaction compared to Adobe Reader documents. Word documents averaged 6 pages in length and Reader documents 38 pages. Documents that were ten pages or less made up 80 % of those that were opened. Approximately half of the documents viewed were reopenings of ones previously used, however history mechanisms were poorly utilised. Document coverage in Microsoft Word was approximated by a normal distribution, while Reader document coverage decrea-sed in a linear fashion, the further one moved toward the end. The time spent with multiple documents open decreased exponentially as the number of documents open increased. We briefly discuss the implications these findings have for the design of document navi-gation systems...|$|E
