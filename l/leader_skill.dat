5000|$|Each card {{is given}} an {{attribute}} and contains three statistics: health, attack and recovery, {{as well as}} its own Active skill and <b>Leader</b> <b>skill</b> which increases the dynamics of the game. Players form teams of Monsters of up to five cards with one leader, whose <b>leader</b> <b>skill</b> will apply {{to the rest of the}} team. The team's health, attack, recovery depends on the individual statistics of the cards as well as the <b>leader</b> <b>skill</b> applied. Players can form and store an increasingly large number of teams corresponding to their level in-game. Before gameplay, users can choose an ally from the friends in-game as well as 3 random player's avatars. The <b>leader</b> <b>skill</b> of the ally will also apply to the team. During gameplay, players face monsters with a specific health, attack and defence. The number of moves the player makes before the monster attacks is represented by the letters [...] "CD", standing for cooldown, above the monster. The active skill of a player's cards also needs a certain number of rounds before being ready to activate.|$|E
5000|$|The various {{statistics}} different monsters possess add to {{the strategic}} nature of the game. One monster on the team is designated as the [...] "Leader", and will have a passive <b>leader</b> <b>skill</b> that affects either the offensive or defensive abilities of the player's team throughout play in a dungeon. In addition, nearly all monsters also possess active skills that the player can use to their advantage in play, but these possess a cooldown timer, which requires the player to take several turns before being {{able to use the}} skill. During play, the player also picks a monster from other players to {{add to the}}ir party. Prior to version 7.4.1, only the player's friends would have their <b>leader</b> <b>skill</b> activated and [...] "adventurers" [...] could only be chosen to possibly become friends after; version 7.4.1 makes the [...] "adventurer" [...] players' monsters have leader skills active as well. Players are limited to what monsters they can use on their teams based on their rank and the monster's associated team cost which is based on the monster's rarity and strength. When the player increases his or her player rank through completing dungeons and earning experience points, the total team cost is increased, as well. Players can save multiple teams to use in the game, starting out at six possible combinations to set up. Teams can be tailored to defeat a particular dungeon, or be set up to best utilize the team's <b>leader</b> <b>skill.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Players {{are able}} to acquire new cards, which called Members, by doing Lives or {{scouting}} through student scouting. They can be [...] "idolized" [...] by combining two same cards.

Each rarity except N rarity has a different <b>leader</b> <b>skill</b> (passive) and active skill. Cards and songs are also divided into attributes that represent each cards' idol type: Smile, Cool, and Pure.|$|E

5000|$|The game {{features}} {{several types}} of dungeons that the player chooses to participate in. All dungeons have an associated Stamina cost, {{which is based on}} the player's rank in the game; this cost is scaled to the dungeon's difficulty, and if the player does not have enough stamina, they must wait until it is restored in real time or use an in-game currency to restore it. At the start, only the Normal Dungeons are available to the player. Enemy monsters in these dungeons will only ever cause standard damage during gameplay. After successful completion of a series of the Normal Dungeons, the Technical Dungeons (added in version 3.0) are unlocked. Technical Dungeons are more difficult, as enemy monsters now possess their own skills to increase their damage output or change the player's board by changing colors, obscuring the view, or adding the block and poison orbs that are unique to enemy monster skills. Some Technical Dungeons also impose restrictions on the player, such as restricting what monsters the player can use or deactivating all monsters' passive skills. After successfully clearing a series of the Technical Dungeons, a new [...] "Challenge Mode" [...] is unlocked, where the player creates a team from friends' monsters, relying on only their own monster's <b>leader</b> <b>skill.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The [...] arcade {{game was}} {{released}} in collaboration with Square Enix on April 24, 2014. Gameplay in Battle Tournament {{is similar to the}} mobile game. The player uses a team of monsters and solves a tile-matching puzzle to determine how powerful their monsters' attacks are, and can activate their monsters' active skills during play for various effects and choose one monster to serve as team leader to use the passive <b>leader</b> <b>skill.</b> However, several changes were made to suit the arcade version, which uses the NESiCA smart card to save playing data for individual players. The puzzle is now on an 8-by-5 grid, allowing for greater movement and combos. The player's team of monsters consists only of their leader monster, three sub members, and a friend monster, however the player can also choose three reserve monsters that they can switch into play. Players choose avatars to play through the game's story mode as well as its online mode to play against other players in real time, and these avatars have their own active skills that can be used during play. Monsters' HP is not pooled, and individual monsters can be temporarily knocked out of play if they lose all HP. If more damage is dealt by the player's monsters when any have run out of HP, then the opponent receives direct damage. When either player's HP runs out, they lose the match. Throughout play, players can obtain special items used to either evolve their collected monsters or to use the game's Rare Egg Machine to obtain new monsters.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} acquisition, measurement, {{and impact of}} leader skills in {{relation}} to business managers' performance in an Australian context. The central problem explored in this thesis is whether effective managers {{are the same as}} successful managers, and the role of leader skills in that respect. Studies of managers commonly equate effectiveness with success. However, Luthans, Hodgetts and Rosenkrantz (1988) have shown that effectiveness and success are not identical concepts. In this thesis, research results are classified into four categories. Managers recognised as achieving both individual success and leader effectiveness are classified as excellent. Those who are comparatively high in individual success but low in leader effectiveness are classified as career managers. Highly effective managers with low individual success are classified as achievement managers. Finally, those low in individual success and low in leader effectiveness are classified as student managers. This classification framework is named the Manager Quad. It is presented in Figure 3. 1. The quadrant categories are {{based on the results of}} a quantitative survey of 185 work unit members and 43 managers drawn from 49 work units employed in 17 companies. These results are reported in Chapter Five. Qualitative data derived from 16 interviews of managers are also analysed and reported in Chapters Six and Seven. The theoretical framework for this thesis, resulting in the four categories, involves a Reality Management Theory of individualised leadership developed within a Symbolic Interactionist paradigm. This theory is summarised in Section 3. 4. It is theorised that outcomes like effectiveness and success depend upon leader skills accrued from life-long learning processes. It is proposed that excellent managers' behaviours form a highly proficient, integrated set of leader skills within what is described in this thesis as the Leader Action Characteristics Set (LACS). This thesis presents a <b>leader</b> <b>skill</b> instrument referred to as the Leader Interaction Skills Inventory (LISI). The instrument demonstrates parsimony, reliability, and validity in an Australian business context. Statistical analysis of data shows <b>leader</b> <b>skill</b> proficiencies are related to managers' leader effectiveness, individual success, and work unit performance. Additionally, qualitative analyses indicate four Differential, Interpreted Life Patterns (DILPs), which provide important conceptual extension of the quad. DILPs are shown to distinguish managers' abilities to define situations that produce desirable business results. In this thesis it is argued that leader skills are relative rather than absolute. The data analysis classifies a number of respondents as excellent managers, indicating that Australia has a reasonable number of business managers with highly proficient leader skills, and shows many other Australian managers possess very sound, though incomplete sets of leader skills...|$|E

40|$|Admiration is the other-praising emotion {{elicited}} by {{the display}} of outstanding skills, talents, or achievements. Most leadership theories state that effective leaders are admired role models that followers emulate. Nevertheless, no demonstration has been provided so far about the actual role of admiration in the leader-follower relationship. This paper shows that leaders who display technical and managerial competences motivate employees {{by means of the}} positive emotion of admiration they elicit. Specifically, we hypothesized and demonstrated that admiration elicited in employees by their <b>leader’s</b> <b>skills</b> increases both their goal orientation to prove and improve their own skills and their contextual performance. In a first field experiment on 137 sales representatives we observed an indirect positive relationship between <b>leader’s</b> <b>skills</b> and followers’ state-goal orientations. Admiration mediated the positive effect of <b>leader’s</b> <b>skills</b> on employees’ motivation. In this study, we also observed a direct and detrimental impact of leaders’ skills on employees learning and proving goal orientations. In a second, cross-sectional, study on 146 full-time teachers we observed that admiration –compared with happiness and gratitude– is the best predictor of state-learning-goal orientation and organizational citizenship behaviors. Implications and limits are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This mixed-methods study {{explores the}} {{reliability}} of portfolios as evidence of mastery of the Interstate School Leaders Licensure Consortium (ISLLC) leader standards. The quantitative portion {{of the study was}} conducted to determine to what extent are portfolios reliable as evidence of mastery of ISLLC standards and functions of students enrolled in educational leadership specialist programs when measured by intra-class correlation. The qualitative portion {{of the study was to}} explore why consistency or inconsistency existed among the portfolio raters. Many colleges and universities utilize portfolios as performance-based assessments to measure growth of educational leadership students. The results of this study are provided as evidence of what is working and what is not working in regard to the utilization of portfolios as evidence of <b>leader</b> <b>skill</b> mastery. iii The two-phase sequential mixed-methods study was used. Portfolios from two cohorts of educational specialist students were rated (N= 30) using a six-point Likert-type scale at the function and standard levels. Three raters from a pool of nine were randomly assigned to each of the thirty portfolios, so that each of the nine raters evaluated between six and nine portfolios, and that each portfolio was evaluated by three of the nine raters. After establishing normal distribution of ratings, the data were evaluated through intra-class correlation to determine agreement of the raters regarding standards mastery for each of the ISLLC functions. The intra-class correlation coefficients ranged from -. 257 to. 626 at the function level and from 105 to. 521 at the standard level. Although no agreement was found at the function or standard level, five themes which were supported by prior research emerged from the qualitative data provided by raters. Weak artifacts, confusing or unclear artifacts, misplaced or incorrectly aligned artifacts, incomplete artifacts, and implied artifacts contributed to discrepancies in scores earned by participants in the Educational Leadership Specialist program. Poor reflections lowered scores portfolios earned. Some raters gave credit for characteristics while others did not. A number of raters gave full credit for all functions in a standard if some of the functions were met, while other raters gave credit only for functions which were explicitly represented. Raters also lacked agreement regarding quality of particular artifacts. All of these issues led to poor consensus among the raters of these portfolios. In conclusion, students who participate in performance-based programs which required a portfolio to document the action component need to be well-trained on the purpose of the portfolio and how to create its components. Additionally, students enrolled in Ed. S. Leadership programs need to internalize the importance of reflection, as it is a practice which will iv assist them in creating a high-quality portfolio. Finally, extensive rater training and practice is essential to reliably scoring educational leadership portfolios. ...|$|E
