40|$|The {{inclusion}} of L. monocytogenes {{in the list}} of organisms subject to HACCP has recently driven the search for detection methods suitable for on-line monitoring. The aim of the work presented in this thesis was the development of a biosensor-based immunoassay for the detection of <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> using SPR. Two polyclonal antibodies were generated from <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> MB extract and heat-treated <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> cells. Both antibodies were purified and characterised by ELISA, SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. An inhibition ELISA-based immunoassay was developed with each antibody for the detection of <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes.</b> Intra- and interday studies were performed to evaluate the accuracy and intermediate precision of the assays. The feasibility of detecting <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> cells in chocolate milk, a food matrix which has been reported to have been the cause of a well known Listeria monocytogenes-&ssoc< food poisoning outbreak, was also examined. To determine the potential cross reactivity of each antibody, inhibition ELISAs were performed with a number of bacterial strains. It was concluded that both antibodies can be used as valuable tools for the genus-specific detection of Listeria cells, but were severely limited for the species-specific detection of <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> cells. Expressing <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> invasion-associated proteins in E. coli allows the safe and efficient production of high quantities of pure protein for use in the generation of <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> specific antibodies and immunoassay development. Two <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> invasion-associated proteins, Intemalin B (InlB) and p 60 (also known as iap), were cloned and expressed in E. coli XL- 10 Gold cells. Expressed protein was purified by immobilised affinity chromatography (IMAC) and used for the selection of specific antibodies (Chapter 5) and for the development a biosensor-based immunoassay for the detection of <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> (Chapter 6). The emergence of recombinant antibody phage display technology has transformed the way we generate antibodies for the specific detection of a chosen analyte. Chapter 5 describes the development of two combinatorial antibody libraries from mice immunised with <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> cells and InlB protein extract. Phage scFv antibodies were selected from both murine antibody libraries and from a large naive human antibody library against <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> cells and invasion associated protein. A number of the selected phage-scFv antibodies could not be expressed as soluble scFv and also showed tendencies to cross react with various bacterial strains tested. A soluble scFv antibody was selcctcd that recognised the <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> invasion-associated protein, Internalin B, but did not recognise <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> cells. An inhibition ELISA was developed with this antibody to indircctly detect <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes.</b> The two polyclonal antibodies and the selected anti-InlB scFv antibody were used in development of three biosensor-based immunoassays using a BIAcore 3000 instrument (chapter 6). Various assay formats and sensor chip surfaces were evaluated. Intra- and interday assay variability studies performed to determine the precision and reproducibility of each assay. The assay developed with the polyclonal anti-InlB polyclonal proved to be most sensitive and cost effective while the assay developed with the anti-InlB scFv antibody fragment proved most specific for the detection of <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes...</b>|$|R

Salt type did not affect (P > 0. 05) <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> populations during pre-blend storage. However, salts (MgCl 2 and NaCl) allowed growth (P < 0. 05) of aerobic populations during storage. Emulsified beef and pork products were processed with NaCl, KCl, sea salt and a NaCl/KCl blend (2 %) and post-processed surface inoculated with <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> (five-strain cocktail) to determine growth/survival at 4 °C for 28 d.

The contribution of individual peptides to bind was investigated using FRED, a protein-ligand docking program. Ten peptides were selected for experimental analysis taking as selection parameters the length, the position in the docking pocket and the score of simulated binding energy. A series of competition assays were carried out using high density colorimetric microarray using various bacteria species (<b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes,</b> <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> genetically modified without internalin A, Listeria innocua and Lactococcus lactis) in solution with computationally selected peptides. The data demonstrated that peptides could be able to distinguish <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> with an EC 50 up to 10 (7) cfu x mL(- 1).

40|$|Introduction. <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of {{bacterial}} central nervous system infections in adults. It often affects immunicompromised and elderly patients. Even with appropriate antimicrobial treatment, mortality due to <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> meningoencephalitis is among the highest of all causes of bacterial central nervous system infections. Case report. We presented a previously healthy, 79 -year-old farmer with typical clinical features of meningoencephalitis. The initial treatment with vancomycin and meropenem did not produce any clinical effect. On day six, <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid and blood culture and identified by using conventional and automated microbiology methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by E test method. After bacterial isolation and identification, the administration of ampicillin and gentamicin was followed by the complete recovery of our patient. Conclusion. This case is presented to emphasize the negative outcome of empirical treatment when <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> is not taken into consideration. Furthermore, the administration of ampicillin and gentamicin combination for treatment should be considered as the best therapeutic option in <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> meningoencephalitis...|$|R
40|$|<b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> is {{pathogenic}} bacterium that can contaminate food products {{during and after}} processing. As ready-to-eat food does not undergo any treatment to ensure its safety before consumption, the risk of foodborne disease must be considered if this pathogen {{is present in the}} food. As diseases caused by contaminated food are an important public health problem today, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence of <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> in different ready-to-eat food products. In the seven-month period from June 1 to December 31, 2011, a total of 1 380 food samples were examined in the Division of Sanitary Bacteriology, Center for Microbiology, Institute of Public Health of Vojvodina in Novi Sad. A total of 912 samples were analyzed for the presence of <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> according to ISO 11290 - 2. The identity of suspected <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> was confirmed using the VITEK 2 Compact system (BioMerieux, France). Out of 912 samples, <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> was detected in 18 (1. 97 %). <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> was mostly found in cooked meals (in 6 samples out of 18), sandwiches (4 samples) and frozen food, such as ice-cream and frozen vegetables (4 samples). It was also found in tofu bread spreads (2 samples), cream cheese (1 sample) and cakes (1 sample). The presence of <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> in some ready-to-eat food could present a public health hazard, particularly to the high-risk population group, because of the high mortality rate associated with listeriosis and the widespread nature of the organism.
