5|$|A few teams {{expressed}} interest in St. Louis. He chose to sign with the Tampa Bay Lightning as he believed {{they were the most}} <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him playing time in the NHL. He made his debut with the team on October 6, 2000. He struggled at first, failing to score a goal in the first six weeks of the season and again found himself out of the lineup at times. Realizing that he was at a career crossroads, St. Louis abandoned the changes to his game that his NHL coaches had impressed on him, trusting his own instincts. He scored his first goal of the season in late November, and finished the season with 18 goals and 40 points – 34 of which came after December 1.|$|E

25|$|Brauer et al. {{studied the}} {{relationship}} between air pollution and proximity to a highway with pregnancy outcomes in a Vancouver cohort of pregnant woman using addresses to estimate exposure during pregnancy. Exposure to NO, NO2, CO PM10 and PM2.5 were associated with infants born small for gestational age (SGA).

25|$|Similarly, {{populations in}} rural Tajikistan {{experience}} spatial health inequities. A study by Jane Falkingham noted that physical access to healthcare {{was one of}} the primary factors influencing quality of maternal healthcare. Further, many women in rural areas of the country did not have adequate access to healthcare resources, resulting in poor maternal and neonatal care. These rural women were, for instance, far more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> birth in their homes without medical oversight.|$|E
25|$|A 2007 {{study by}} the California Department of Public Health {{found that women who}} lived near farm fields sprayed with {{endosulfan}} and the related organochloride pesticide dicofol during the first eight weeks of pregnancy are several times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> birth to children with autism. This is the first study to look for an association between endosulfan and autism, and additional study is needed to confirm the connection. A 2009 assessment concluded that epidemiology and rodent studies that suggest male reproductive and autism effects are open to other interpretations, and that developmental or reproductive toxicity in rats occurs only at endosulfan doses that cause neurotoxicity.|$|E
25|$|Ovarian {{cancer has}} low prevalence, {{even in the}} high-risk group of women from the ages of 50 to 60 (about one in 2000), and {{screening}} of women with average risk is more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> ambiguous results than detect a problem which requires treatment. Because ambiguous results {{are more likely than}} detection of a treatable problem, and because the usual response to ambiguous results is invasive interventions, in women of average risk, the potential harms of having screening without an indication outweigh the potential benefits. The purpose of screening is to diagnose ovarian cancer at an early stage, when it {{is more likely to be}} treated successfully.|$|E

50|$|Parental {{educational}} attainment {{is the most}} significant socioeconomic factor in predicting the child’s cognitive abilities, those with a mother with high IQ are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have higher IQs themselves. Similarly, maternal occupation is associated with better cognitive achievement. Those whose mothers’ job entails problem-solving are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>given</b> stimulating tasks and games, and are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> achieve more advanced verbal competency.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to social}} pressure, parents of sick {{children}} in childcare {{may be willing}} <b>to</b> <b>give</b> unnecessary medical care to their children when advised {{to do so by}} childcare workers and even if it is against the advice of health care providers. In particular, children in childcare are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>given</b> antibiotics than children outside of childcare.|$|R
25|$|Dominant pairs are {{the only}} {{breeding}} pair within their groups, and the female generally has authority over the breeding male. While nonbreeding group members can be the leading pair's offspring, immigrant adults may also live with and cooperate in these groups. This social grouping in cotton-top tamarins is hypothesized to arise from predation pressure. Cotton-top tamarins exhibit prosocial behavior that benefits {{other members of the}} group, and are well known for engaging in cooperative breeding whereby the group's subordinate adults help in rearing the offspring of the dominant pair. The dominant female is more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> birth to nonidentical twins than a singleton, so it would be too energetically expensive for just one pair to raise the young.|$|E
25|$|The framing arch of each {{panel is}} historiated, {{containing}} {{series of small}} and imagined but highly detailed and symbolic, protruding or raised, marble statues which augment the narrative of the particular episode from Christ's life. The triptych {{is often associated with}} van der Weyden's other John the Baptist altarpiece as both utilise imagined stone reliefs both as framing devices and as a means to develop on the main theme of the particular panel. The arches are painted in browns, <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the appearance of timber. They are fantastic rather than realistic, serving as a device to include the small relief figures located in the archivolts which reflect on and accentuate the narrative and theme of the panel on which they appear.|$|E
25|$|An individual's FOK {{judgments}} {{are not necessarily}} accurate, and attributes of all three metamemory hypotheses are apparent in {{the factors that influence}} FOK judgments and their accuracy. For example, a person is more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> a higher FOK rating, indicating that they do know the answer, when presented with questions they feel they should know the answer to. This is in keeping with the cue familiarity hypothesis, as the familiarity of the question terms influences the individual's judgment. Partial retrieval also impacts FOK judgments, as proposed by the accessibility hypothesis. The accuracy of an FOK judgment is dependent upon the accuracy of the partial information which is retrieved. Consequently, accurate partial information leads to accurate FOK judgments, while inaccurate partial information leads to inaccurate FOK judgments. FOK {{judgments are}} also influenced by the number of memory traces linked to the cue. When a cue is linked to fewer memory traces, resulting in a low level of competition, a higher FOK rating is given, thus supporting the competition hypothesis.|$|E

500|$|Studies {{suggest that}} slow lorises are polygynandrous. Infants are either parked on {{branches}} while their parents find food or else are carried {{by one of}} the parents. [...] Due to their long gestations (about six months), small litter sizes, low birth weights, long weaning times (three to six months), and long gaps between births, slow loris populations have one of the slowest growth rates among mammals of similar size. Pygmy slow lorises are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> birth to twins—from 50% to 100% of births, depending on the study; in contrast, this phenomenon is rare (3% occurrence) in Bengal slow lorises. A seven-year study of captive-bred pygmy slow lorises showed a skewed sex distribution, with 1.68males born for every 1female.|$|E

500|$|In {{his closing}} argument, Coakley {{described}} a chronological sequence of mutinous occurrences, beginning at Camp Shoemaker {{shortly after the}} explosion when {{two and a half}} companies were mixed together for two weeks. Coakley stated that conspiratorial talk among the men about refusing to work and {{trying to get out of}} loading ammunition was the root of their August 9 mass refusal. Coakley described how the mutiny continued in the barge when Joe Small spoke to the men and asked them to stick together. Coakley entered into the record his definition of mutiny: [...] "Collective insubordination, collective disobedience of lawful orders of a superior officer, is mutiny." [...] He gave his opinion that men who admitted in time of war that they were afraid to load ammunition were of a low moral character and were <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> false testimony.|$|E
500|$|During {{the same}} session, cleric Mohamed Habib al-Miqdad made a long {{testimony}} {{in which he}} described alleged torture and renounced his accusation that Nasser Al Khalifa, {{the son of the}} king had tortured him in person. The thirteen asked their defense lawyers to stop representing them after the judge decided to continue hearings in secret and subsequently banned media coverage of the case, due to [...] "national security reasons". New lawyers were appointed by court and the judge declared that the final judgment would be given even if the defendants refused to attend. The Court originally expected to give its final verdict on 14 August was attended by a number of foreign diplomats, but the session was deferred until 4 September with no specific reason given. The verdict was expected to {{have a significant impact on}} the course of the uprising and analysts suggested that the government was uncertain how to deal with the defendants who became popular heroes, given that their release was <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> new impetus to the protest movement.|$|E
500|$|Bell et al. {{found that}} {{homosexual}} {{men were more}} likely than heterosexual men to have felt especially close to their mothers. Male respondents who were unusually close to their mothers were more likely to describe themselves as having been feminine children, but only a minority of boys with this kind of background became homosexual. Bell et al. concluded that male homosexuality is not the [...] "result of an unusually strong maternal identification", and that mothers have only a small influence on their sons′ psychosexual development. Homosexual men were less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> positive descriptions of their fathers, but more likely to have negative feelings toward their fathers, to dislike, hate, or fail to feel close to them, or to consider them hostile or detached. They {{were also more likely to}} feel more similar to their mothers than to their fathers, or to prefer to be like their mothers. Bell et al. concluded that, [...] "Unfavorable relationships with fathers" [...] have a weak connection to [...] "gender nonconformity and early homosexual experiences".|$|E
