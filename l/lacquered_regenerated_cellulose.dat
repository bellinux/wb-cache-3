The {{purpose of this}} research is to extract cellulose from mahang (Macaranga gigantea) wood and convert the extracted cellulose (MCC) to nanocellulose using ionic liquid pretreatment. 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride (BMIMCl) was used to treat cellulose that has been extracted from mahang wood. Three different <b>regenerated</b> <b>celluloses</b> were obtained from the different weight ratio of celluloses treated with BMIMCl (2 wt %, 5 wt % and 8 wt %).

The results of characterizations indicated that 2 wt % of <b>regenerated</b> <b>celluloses</b> with the highest amount of ionic liquid used obtained high crystallinity compared to 5 wt % and 8 wt % <b>regenerated</b> <b>celluloses.</b> Hence, from all of the characterizations of <b>regenerated</b> <b>celluloses,</b> only 2 wt % <b>regenerated</b> <b>celluloses</b> can be correlate to the real properties and characteristics of nanocellulose (NCCs) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} study we {{evaluated}} spontan-eous and stimulated adherence of human monocytes to <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> and polyacrylonitrile (AN 69) membranes. Spontaneous adherence at 60 min was significantly higher for <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> (28 ± 2 %, P< 0. 001) than for AN 69 (11 ± 2) membranes. Stimuli such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide, TNFa, interleukin- 1 and- 6 as well as platelet-activating factor, but not IL- 4, significantly enhanced adherence at 60 min to AN 69 (28 to 30 %). In contrast, adherence was not further inducible {{in the presence of}} <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose.</b> Both spontaneous and cytokine/bacterial lipopolysaccharide-stimulated adherence were signi-ficantly reduced by SDZ- 63072, a specific platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist. This difference in sensitivity of monocyte adherence reflects probably the intrinsic ability of <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> to provide maximal spontaneous monocyte adhesion. These data suggest that PAF may act as an adherence mediator. This is in line with the ability of <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> to directly stimulate monocytes to synthesize platelet-activating factor and with the ability of cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide to stimulate its synthesis.

The influence of both calcium chloride (CaCl(2)) and sodium chloride (NaCl) on CMC adsorption was examined.

The CMC layers adsorbed onto <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> surfaces from CaCl(2) solutions exhibited greater stability upon exposure to flowing water than layers adsorbed from NaCl solutions. Both QCM-D and SPR results showed that CMC adsorption onto <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> surfaces from CaCl(2) solutions increased with increasing CaCl(2) concentration up to the solubility limit (10 mM).

40|$|Cellulose is {{the most}} {{abundant}} polymer in nature {{and it is an}} important constituent in most flowers, trees, and even some animals. Cellulose has an established use in many important products, such as textile fibers, paper and paperboard, and recently new applications have received increased attention. The crystalline parts of the cellulose wood fiber can be extracted and this material can be used for applications such as forming thin films or as stabilizers in emulsions. New and more environmentally friendly processes to dissolve cellulose and produce textile fibers are also of interest. However, both native and <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> build up complicated supramolecular structures that are, to some extent, still not completely resolved.

In the work covered in this thesis, solid-state NMR was used to gain information of the supramolecular structure of cellulose. Measurements were conducted on both native and <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose,</b> exposed to a range of different treatments. Using the 1 D solid-state NMR spectrum, the effects on the material after a certain treatment could be followed and elucidated.

In addition, the influence of drying procedure on the structure of <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> was studied. Complete conversion of the starting material into <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> was seen regardless of the choice of coagulation medium. Coagulation in water predominantly formed cellulose II, whereas coagulation in alcohols mainly generated non-crystalline structures.

This phenomenon was observed for all used coagulants in this study, but to various degrees with regard to the polarity of the coagulant. From NMR cryoporometry, it was concluded that drying induced hornification generates an increase of nano-sized pores. A bimodal pore size distribution with pore radius maxima of a few nanometers was observed, and this pattern increased as a function of drying.
