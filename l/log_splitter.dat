5000|$|Although a good <b>log</b> <b>splitter</b> {{can save}} the {{operator}} hours of labor, {{it is not possible}} to make it completely safe. Only trained adults should operate a <b>log</b> <b>splitter,</b> since anything caught between the log and the splitting blade will receive at least 10 tons of pressure. Most hydraulic machines now have 'two handed operation' for safety which means that both of the operator's hands are needed to actuate the splitter thus keeping them out of the way of the moving blade.|$|E

40|$|We {{estimated}} {{costs associated with}} injuries to hands from <b>log</b> <b>splitters</b> and circular saws used to cut up firewood and assessed the value of prevention. The study was carried out as a cost of illness study with an incidence approach based on 57 consecutive patients (median age 51; range 8 [...] 81) with injuries to the hand or forearm. Twenty-six of the 57 had an amputation which required microsurgery and 31 / 57 had various injuries. Median Hand Injury Severity Score (HISS) reflecting the severity of all injuries was 67 (range 6 [...] 332). Median DASH score after 2 [...] 7 years was 12. 5 (0 [...] 73. 3). Total cost (direct costs, costs of lost productivity, and lost quality of life) was estimated to roughly EUR 14 million (EUR 2. 8 million/year), where the cost of lost {{quality of life is}} 82 % of the total cost and loss of productivity and direct costs are 9 % each. Injuries sustained from <b>log</b> <b>splitters</b> and circular saws account for considerable costs, but first and foremost human suffering...|$|R
25|$|The {{growth in}} {{popularity}} of wood heat {{also led to}} the development and marketing of a greater variety of equipment for cutting, splitting and processing firewood. Consumer grade hydraulic <b>log</b> <b>splitters</b> were developed to be powered by electricity, gasoline, or PTO of farm tractors. In 1987 the US Department of Agriculture published a method for producing kiln dried firewood, on the basis that better heat output and increased combustion efficiency can be achieved with logs containing lower moisture content.|$|R
50|$|A <b>log</b> <b>splitter</b> is a {{piece of}} {{machinery}} or equipment used for splitting firewood from softwood or hardwood logs that have been pre-cut into sections (rounds), usually by chainsaw or on a saw bench. Many log splitters consist of a hydraulic or electrical rod and piston assembly and these are often rated by the tons of force they can generate. The higher the pressure rating, the greater the thickness or length of the rounds that can be split. The <b>log</b> <b>splitter</b> consists of all four major hydraulic components.|$|E
50|$|No {{matter what}} the power source, a <b>log</b> <b>splitter</b> either uses a {{hydraulic}} piston to drive the log through a stationary blade or a rotating cone shaped screw mandrel that pulls the log up over a wedge. Some models have attachments that prevent the split logs from falling to the ground allowing the operator to reposition the logs quickly for a second pass on the <b>log</b> <b>splitter.</b> Some cone or screw splitters are mounted on steel platforms mounted on a 3-point linkage that allow the log to be repeatedly split into smaller pieces without putting the wood down and up again.|$|E
50|$|The {{behavior}} of each log {{can not be}} predicted, so a safety zone should be established around the splitter to prevent injury from flying splinters of wood. Helpers {{can pick up the}} individual pieces of firewood, but should not stand near the <b>log</b> <b>splitter</b> while it is in operation.|$|E
50|$|Circuit {{breakers}} and fuses {{are used}} to detect short circuits between the line and neutral or ground wires or the drawing of more current than the wires are rated to handle (overload protection) to prevent overheating and possible fire. These protective devices are usually mounted in a central panel—most commonly a distribution board or consumer unit—in a building, but some wiring systems also provide a protection device at the socket or within the plug. Residual-current devices, also known as ground-fault circuit interrupters and appliance leakage current interrupters, {{are used to}} detect ground faults - flow of current in other than the neutral and line wires (like the ground wire or a person). When a ground fault is detected, the device quickly cuts off the circuit. In northern and central Europe, residential electrical supply is commonly 400 V three-phase electric power, which gives 230 V between any single phase and neutral; house wiring may be a mix of three-phase and single-phase circuits, but three-phase residential use is rare in the UK. High-power appliances such as kitchen stoves, water heaters and maybe household power heavy tools like <b>log</b> <b>splitters</b> may be supplied from the 400 V three-phase power supply.|$|R
50|$|For {{production}} agriculture, {{past and}} present, two-wheel tractors accept {{a wide range}} of implements, such as the following: For soil-working: rototillers, moldboard plows, disc-plows, rotary plows, root/tuber harvesting plows, small subsoiler plows, powered and non-powered harrows, seeders, transplanters, and planters. Even zero till/no-till planters and seeders have become available. In plant protection and weed control, two-wheel tractor implements consist of various inter-cultivators and sprayers. For harvesting, available implements are: Forage: Sickle bar mowers, disk mowers, hayrakes, hay tedders, haybalers and bale wrappers silage production. For grain harvest: reaper/grain harvesters, reaper-binders, and even combine harvesters are available typically only for Asian two-wheel tractors. For transport, trailers with capacities from 0.5 to 5 plus ton cargoes are available. General mowing implements consist of lawn mowers, brush mowers, and flail mowers. For snow removal, implements consist of snowblowers, power sweepers, and snow/dozer blades. Other implements include: chipper/shredders, <b>log</b> <b>splitters,</b> electrical generator, pressure washer, crimper-roller, fertilizer/salt/lime spreader, and stump grinder. This list of implements (which may not be complete) means that two-wheel tractors can execute practically all of the chores done by larger 4-wheel tractors, with the exception of items like front-loaders, which obviously have the physical stability requirements of a 4-wheel (two-axle) tractor.|$|R
50|$|A simple <b>log</b> <b>splitter</b> may be {{powered by}} an {{electric}} motor driving a hydraulic pump or by gasoline or diesel engine {{with or without a}} tractor. The non-electric versions can be used remotely where the splitter can be moved to the location of the cut wood source. Split logs can then be loaded into trucks, trailers or bulk bags.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>log</b> <b>splitter</b> {{models for}} home use have a rating around 10 tons, but {{professional}} hydraulic models may exert 25 tons of force or more. There are also manual log splitters, which use mechanical leverage to force logs through a sharpened blade assembly and screw or 'corkscrew' types that are driven directly from an agricultural tractor's power take-off shaft where the splitter is mounted on the three point linkage.|$|E
5000|$|Scheitholz is a German {{term for}} log {{sections}} that that been split lengthways with an axe or <b>log</b> <b>splitter</b> {{and that are}} primarily used for firewood or the manufacture of wood shingles. The individual pieces of timber are called Holzscheite (obs.: Holzscheiter), derived from the Old High German word scît = [...] "piece". Scheitholz boilers are used to burn quantities of Scheithölzer. The expression [...] "auf Scheitholz knien" [...] ("to kneel on scheitholz) was a disciplinary measure used in times when corporal punishment in schools was still permitted.|$|E

[...] In 1959 the University recognized O'Brien's lifetime contributions by awarding him {{the title of}} [...] "dean emeritus" [...] and a LL.D. concurrent with his retirement. He was also awarded a D.Sc. by Northwestern University and a D.Eng. by Purdue. O'Brien Hall, the home of Berkeley's Hydraulic Engineering Lab, was named in his honor. In 1962 O'Brien and colleague Dwight Vorkoeper received a patent for their hydraulically-actuated divisible-wedge <b>log</b> <b>splitter.</b> 12 linear feet of O'Brien's documents are archived in University of California, Riverside's Water Resources Collection.|$|E
50|$|Most {{firewood}} {{also requires}} splitting, which {{also allows for}} faster seasoning by exposing more surface area. Today most splitting is done with a hydraulic splitting machine, {{but it can also}} be split with a splitting maul. More unusual, and dangerous, is a tapered screw-style design, that augers into the wood, splitting it, and can be powered by either a power take-off drive, a dedicated internal combustion engine, or a rugged electric pipe-threading machine, which is safer than the other power sources because the power can be shut off more easily if necessary. Another method is to use a kinetic <b>log</b> <b>splitter,</b> which uses a rack and pinion system powered by a small motor and a large flywheel used for energy storage.|$|E
50|$|Log {{splitting}} is {{the act of}} splitting firewood from logs {{that have}} been pre-cut into sections (rounds, bolts, billets). This {{can be done by}} hand, using an axe or maul, or by using a mechanical <b>log</b> <b>splitter.</b> When splitting a log by hand, it is best to aim for the cracks (called checks), if there are any visible. Some types of wood are harder to split than others, including extremely hard woods, as well as types like gum which an axe will often bounce off of, and cherry, which is typically so twisted it's near impossible to get a clean split, and elm. Any type of wood, being thick or tall, having large knots or twisted grain can make it difficult to split. In some cases, it is easiest to aim for the edges and split the log into multiple pieces. Batoning is splitting small pieces of wood for kindling or other purposes sometimes with a batoning chisel, a special chisel with one sharp side used for splitting.|$|E
40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{the proper design of}} {{agricultural}} machines for both professional and non-professional use has assumed a relevant role in workers protection and accident avoidance. The {{activities related to}} cutting and sawing of firewood is the main cause of injuries or death of the operator. This is often due to the use of inadequately built or modified machines, improper use of equipment and use of tools intended for other purposes. This study aimed to design a conical screw <b>log</b> <b>splitter</b> that meets the criteria of the European Directive 2006 / 42 /EC and the technical standards of EN 609 - 2 : 1999 +A 1 : 2009 (E) guideline. For a proper design we determined the forces that influence the machine during its use, and sized the machine accordingly. The <b>log</b> <b>splitter</b> was scanned and digitalized in three dimensions. From the digital model we obtained a real model in 5 : 1 scale. Comparing the created <b>log</b> <b>splitter</b> with other solutions available on the market we confirmed its similar costs with the costs of tools currently marketed. The productivity of the machine was only slightly lower than that of machines not equipped with protections, but its safety was significantly improve...|$|E

40|$|A <b>log</b> <b>splitter</b> is a gasoline- or {{diesel-powered}} {{machine that}} uses a hydraulic-powered cutting wedge {{to do the work}} of an axe. Log-splitter injuries that do not result in amputation of digits or limbs are uncommon and not well described in the literature. We present a unique case of a patient who sustained a log-splitter injury that resulted in thrombosis of the radial artery and avulsion laceration of the ulnar artery leading to acute hand ischemia, in addition to scapholunate ligament disruption leading to a DISI deformity. In this case, thrombolytic therapy was contraindicated and surgical revascularization was the best possible treatment option. Our case illustrates the pitfalls of using this modality in a crush injury, since the use of thrombolytics in this instance would have resulted in severe hemorrhage. An important clinical caveat is the potentially misleading arteriographic diagnosis of thrombosis and/or spasm...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{framework}} that improves a designer’s capability to determine near-optimal sizes of components for a given system architecture.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{framework}} for automated component sizing to extend a designer’s ability to evaluate a particular configuration during the architecture exploration phase of a design process. Component sizing is a hard problem to solve, both from a computational and modeling aspect.

In current approaches, designers rely on heuristics and iterate over the multiple objectives and requirements until a satisfactory solution is found.

40|$|The broad {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to contribute knowledge that enables improvements in how designers model decision alternatives at the systems level—i. e., how they model different system configurations and concepts. There are three principal complications: (1) design concepts and systems configurations are partially-defined solutions to a problem that correspond to a large set of possible design implementations, (2) each concept or configuration may operate on different physical principles, and (3) decisions typically involve tradeoffs between multiple competing objectives that can include "non-engineering" considerations such as production costs and profits. This research is an investigation of a data-driven approach to modeling partially-defined system alternatives that addresses these issues. The approach is based on compositional strategy in which designers model a system alternative using abstract models of its components. The component models are representations of the rational tradeoffs available to designers when implementing the components. Using these models, designers can predict key properties of the final implementation of each system alternative. A new construct, called a parameterized efficient set, is introduced as the decision-theoretic basis for generating the component-level tradeoff models. Appropriate efficiency criteria are defined for the cases of deterministic and uncertain data. It is shown that the model composition procedure is mathematically sound under reasonable assumptions for the case of deterministic data. This research also introduces an approach for describing the valid domain of a data-driven model based on the use of support-vector machines. Engineering examples include performing requirements allocation for a hydraulic <b>log</b> <b>splitter</b> and architecture selection for a hybrid vehicle. Ph. D.

40|$|Today s {{market is}} driven by the desire for {{increasingly}} complex products that perform well from manufacturing to disposal. Designing these products for multiple lifecycle phases requires effective management of engineering knowledge and integration of this knowledge across multiple disciplines. By managing this knowledge, products can be realized faster, perform better and be more complex. However, management techniques are often very costly and managers can easily become bogged down with large quantities of information, slowing the design process and degrading knowledge transfer. Thus, a need exists for effective yet inexpensive knowledge management. One approach for decreasing the costs associated with generating design knowledge is to reuse modules of existing knowledge. In Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), information about a design is stored formally in many knowledge structures, or models, including requirements, stakeholders, and analyses. To support the reuse of the existing knowledge in design, MBSE is used as a basis for integrating engineering analysis models. In this thesis, a framework is presented for model classification that organizes models by components and aspects. This scheme is found to be useful in classifying engineering analysis models for reuse by storing them as a set in containers known as Multi-Aspect Component Models (MAsCoMs). Each model in a MAsCoM is related to the formal structure model of a physical component, and to the many aspects of the component that the model represents. The Systems Modeling Language, OMG SysML, is used to implement MAsCoMs and support MBSE. Validation of the MAsCoM concept is performed with fluid-power design examples, including a <b>log</b> <b>splitter,</b> scissor lift, and hydraulic excavator. In these examples, MAsCoMs improve design value by 1) Classifying modular and composable engineering analysis models for reuse in multiple disciplines, and 2) Providing knowledge modules to computer-automated algorithms for the future automated composition of component models into system models to perform system-level analyses.

40|$|In this research, {{the focus}} is on {{improving}} a designer's capability to determine near-optimal sizes of components for a given system architecture. Component sizing is a hard problem to solve {{because of the presence of}} competing objectives, requirements from multiple disciplines, and the need for finding a solution quickly for the architecture being considered. In current approaches, designers rely on heuristics and iterate over the multiple objectives and requirements until a satisfactory solution is found. To improve on this state of practice, this research introduces advances in the following two areas: a.) Formulating a component sizing problem in a manner that is convenient to designers and b.) Solving the component sizing problem in an efficient manner so that all of the imposed requirements are satisfied simultaneously and the solution obtained is mathematically optimal. In particular, an acausal, algebraic, equation-based, declarative modeling approach is taken to solve component sizing problems efficiently. This is because global optimization algorithms exist for algebraic models and the computation time is considerably less as compared to the optimization of dynamic simulations. In this thesis, the mathematical programming language known as GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System) and its associated global optimization solvers are used to solve component sizing problems efficiently. Mathematical programming languages such as GAMS are not convenient for formulating component sizing problems and therefore the Systems Modeling Language developed by the Object Management Group (OMG SysML) is used to formally capture and organize models related to component sizing into libraries that can be reused to compose new models quickly by connecting them together. Model-transformations are then used to generate low-level mathematical programming models in GAMS that can be solved using commercial off-the-shelf solvers such as BARON (Branch and Reduce Optimization Navigator) to determine the component sizes that satisfy the requirements and objectives imposed on the system. This framework is illustrated by applying it to an example application for sizing a hydraulic <b>log</b> <b>splitter.</b> M. S.
