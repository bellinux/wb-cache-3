The answer to that problem came as the members looked for good names in their <b>local</b> <b>phone</b> book. When they stumbled upon Lake Bodom, they realized that it was a name with impact and one which had an interesting story behind it. A long list of possible names involving the word Bodom was then made, and they settled with Children of Bodom. The band's name is derived from the Lake Bodom murders.|$|E

500|$|A January 1947 contest on WINC was {{responsible}} for knocking out the entire telephone system {{for the city of}} Winchester. Mark Sheeler, a disc jockey at WINC, gave a [...] "wolf whistle" [...] as the signal for Winchester area [...] "housewives" [...] to call the studio. The first one to reach him would win [...] "a free pair of nylon hose and a $10 handbag". The station received around 4,000 simultaneous phone calls; the first call to get through was from the telephone company. [...] Sheeler was informed that his contest was jamming <b>local</b> <b>phone</b> lines. [...] He quickly made an on-air announcement calling off the contest.|$|E

2500|$|Local number {{portability}} (LNP) allows a subscriber to request moving an existing telephone number to another telephone service provider. Number portability usually has geographic limitations, {{such as an}} existing <b>local</b> <b>phone</b> company only being able to port to a competitor within the same rate centre. [...] Mobile carriers may have much larger market areas, and can assign or accept numbers from any area within the region.|$|E
2500|$|The {{format and}} {{allocation}} of <b>local</b> <b>phone</b> numbers {{are controlled by}} each nation's respective government, either directly or by sponsored organizations (such as NANPA in the US or CNAC in Canada). [...] In the United States, each state's public service commission regulates, as does the Federal Communications Commission. [...] In Canada, which shares the same country code with the U.S. (due to Bell Canada's previous ownership by the U.S.-based Bell System), regulation is mainly through the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.|$|E
2500|$|In {{rural areas}} with magneto crank {{telephones}} connected to party lines, the <b>local</b> <b>phone</b> number {{consisted of the}} line number plus the ringing pattern of the subscriber. To dial a number such as [...] "3R122" [...] meant making a request to the operator the third party line (if making a call off your own local one), followed by turning the telephone's crank once, a short pause, then twice and twice again. Also common was a code of long and short rings, so one party's call might be signaled by two longs and another's by two longs followed by a short. [...] It was not uncommon to have over a dozen ring cadences (and subscribers) on one line.|$|E

40|$|High {{error rate}} in speech {{recognition}} is {{largely due to}} effects of <b>phone</b> <b>local</b> mismatch caused by unclear speaking or noises. In this paper, we propose an approach of using <b>local</b> mismatch <b>phone</b> to improve the reliability of confidence measure. The features of <b>local</b> mismatch <b>phone</b> can be extracted from the recognition phone sequence by computing occurrence frequency of each phone and comparing with a preset threshold. Occurrence frequency is defined as occurrence time of recognition phone in its frame best phone sequence divided by interval. Frame best phone is the symbol of HMM state at the end of maximum likelihood token at certain frame. The effectiveness of this feature is evaluated on standard and accented Mandarin speech databases. It gives significant Equal Error Rate reduction of 19. 7 % and 8. 4 %, respectively. In addition to fast computation, this feature is independent of acoustic model, and is convenient for combination with other features...|$|R
2500|$|In the 1960s, the FCC began {{allowing}} other long-distance companies, namely MCI, {{to offer}} specialized services. [...] In the 1970s, the FCC allowed other companies to expand offerings to the public. [...] A lawsuit in 1982 {{led by the}} Justice Department after AT underpriced other companies, resulted in the Breakup of the Bell System from AT [...] Beginning in 1984, the FCC implemented a new goal that all long-distance companies had equal access to the <b>local</b> <b>phone</b> companies' customers. Effective January 1, 1984, the Bell System’s many member-companies were variously merged into seven independent [...] "Regional Holding Companies", also known as Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs), or [...] "Baby Bells". This divestiture reduced the book value of AT by approximately 70%.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first public}} dial-up BBS was {{developed}} by Ward Christensen and Randy Suess. According to an early interview, when Chicago was snowed under during the Great Blizzard of 1978, the two began preliminary work on the Computerized Bulletin Board System, or CBBS. The system came into existence largely through a fortuitous combination of Christensen having a spare S-100 bus computer and an early Hayes internal modem, and Suess's insistence that the machine be placed at his house in Chicago {{where it would be}} a <b>local</b> <b>phone</b> call to millions of users. Christensen patterned the system after the cork board his local computer club used to post information like [...] "need a ride". CBBS officially went online on 16 February 1978. CBBS, which kept a count of callers, reportedly connected 253,301 callers before it was finally retired.|$|E
2500|$|The {{telecommunications}} industry has gravitated to Omaha {{over the last}} 30 years. After the U.S. government relocated the Strategic Air Command here after World War II the city became {{home to one of}} the world's most advanced and secure phone systems. Other factors in the city's success include Omaha's location in the Central Time Zone, making it more convenient to call either coast during the work day, as well as local speech patterns, described as [...] "pure American," [...] making it easily understood everywhere. Nebraska state regulators granted <b>local</b> <b>phone</b> companies wide latitude to deploy new services rapidly, and Omaha's Metropolitan Community College created telecommunications-related courses and training programs. Since the early 1980s a number of large hotel and travel reservation operations, including those for Marriott, Hyatt, Radisson and Westin hotels, as well as the traffic information center for Greyhound Bus Lines have all been located in the city. After the AT breakup, US West, the phone company whose 14-state territory includes Nebraska, adopted the slogan [...] "Dial 800 and get Omaha" [...] to promote its services. Worldwide telecommunications company West Corporation was founded in Omaha in 1986 and is currently still headquartered there. Other nationwide companies with major call center operations located in Omaha include Paypal, Cox Communications, and Aflac.|$|E

2500|$|The {{telephony}} {{segment is}} dominated by private-sector and two state-run businesses. Most companies were formed by a recent revolution and restructuring launched within a decade, directed by Ministry of Communications and IT, Department of Telecommunications and Minister of Finance. Since then, most companies gained 2G, 3G and 4G licences and engaged fixed-line, mobile and internet business in India. On landlines, intra-circle calls are considered local calls while inter-circle are considered long distance calls. Foreign Direct Investment policy which increased the foreign ownership cap from 49% to 74%.Now it is 100%. The Government is working to integrate the whole country in one telecom circle. For long distance calls, the area code prefixed with a zero is dialled first which is then followed by the number (i.e., to call Delhi, 011 would be dialled first followed by the phone number). For international calls, [...] "00" [...] must be dialled first followed by the country code, area code and <b>local</b> <b>phone</b> number. The country code for India is 91. Several international fibre-optic links include those to Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Russia, and Germany. Some major telecom operators in India include Airtel, Vodafone, Idea, Aircel, BSNL, MTNL, Reliance Communications, TATA Teleservices, Infotel, MTS, Uninor, TATA DoCoMo, Videocon, Augere, Tikona Digital.|$|E

40|$|Technology {{is rapidly}} {{expanding}} in to {{every part of}} daily life {{as evidenced by the}} increase in the number of new mobile phone devices appearing on the market while older models remain in use and are reused. The rapid emergence of different and new mobile devices presents challenges for mobile phone forensic investigation. Some models cannot be supported by mobile forensic tools and others have ways of preventing access. XRY is one of the best known mobile forensic tools and it is constantly updating signatures and producing new connectors to keep up with the market. However, the speed of new mobile devices’ release and the emergence of new designs will always result some being overlooked. The purpose of this research project is to conduct an investigation to identify some models on the New Zealand market that are not currently supported by XRY and to perform forensic extraction on one or two as well as a supported model. The research is to identify configuration signatures or characteristics of <b>local</b> mobile <b>phone</b> devices that are absent from the XRY database. The result was that four <b>local</b> mobile <b>phone</b> devices (test phones) that are sold and operate in New Zealand were located. Some of these models were manufactured specifically for local Network Service Providers. They were tested following a methodology derived from previous research literature including the use of practise standards and procedures for digital forensics. The research findings determine the capability of XRY 6. 5 to extract data from these <b>local</b> mobile <b>phone</b> devices. As a result, two of these test devices (Phones 2 and 4) were not officially recognised by XRY and were absent from its database. Phones 1 and 3 were in the database. XRY was able to extract data from each test phone device (logical extraction) however not all the data was extracted. Thus, some of the test devices already recognised by the tool were not fully supported. XRY was able to extract most of the data from some test devices while others had incomplete data. Most of the deleted test data was not able to be recovered. A discussion of the findings indicates that <b>local</b> mobile <b>phone</b> devices can be supported by forensic tools such as XRY; however there are limitations due to each tool’s performance criteria. These <b>local</b> mobile <b>phone</b> devices can be included in the XRY’s list of supported device profiles and this research provides implications for digital forensic analysts about how these test phones can be recognised and supported. There are also further possible aspects for future work within this research area that can focus on improving the capability of forensic tools to conduct physical analyses for these <b>local</b> test <b>phones...</b>|$|R
