5|$|Last Man Standing: Similar to Deathmatch, the player's {{objective}} is to remain alive longer than their opponents, putting an emphasis on number of deaths rather than kills. Players start with all weapons (except the Redeemer) available, fully <b>loaded,</b> <b>and</b> have a set number of lives. Power-ups, including health and ammunition packs, are unavailable. Once a player runs out of lives, they lose.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} two platforms, one for {{unloading}} {{and one for}} loading. Two trains are <b>loaded</b> <b>and</b> unloaded while the third train is running the course. There is also a separate line in the station where riders can wait for the first seat. The loading platform has red overhead lights, which are located above the train. Millennium Force's theme song is played in the station while riders are boarding.|$|E
5|$|These {{analyses}} are conducted when traveling empty, loading and unloading, when partially and fully <b>loaded,</b> <b>and</b> {{under conditions of}} temporary overloading. Places subject to the largest stresses are studied carefully, such as hold-bottoms, hatch-covers, bulkheads between holds, and the bottoms of ballast tanks. Great Lakes bulkers also must be designed to withstand springing, or developing resonance with the waves, which can cause fatigue fractures.|$|E

50|$|Memory {{dependence}} {{prediction is}} a technique, employed by high-performance out-of-order execution microprocessors that execute memory access operations (<b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores) out of program order, to predict true dependencies between <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores at instruction execution time. With the predicted dependence information, the processor can then decide to speculatively execute certain <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores out of order, while preventing other <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores from executing out-of-order (keeping them in-order). Later in the pipeline, memory disambiguation techniques {{are used to}} determine if the <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores were correctly executed and, if not, to recover.|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} of its {{construction}} the Albert Dock was considered a revolutionary docking system because ships were <b>loaded</b> <b>and</b> unloaded directly from/to the warehouses. Two years after it opened it was modified to feature the world's first hydraulic cranes. Due to its open yet secure design, the Albert Dock became a popular store for valuable cargoes such as brandy, cotton, tea, silk, tobacco, ivory and sugar. However, despite the Albert Dock's advanced design, the rapid development of shipping technology meant that within 50 years, larger, more open docks were required, although it remained a valuable store for cargo.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the reactor}} itself {{commenced}} in February 1944. Watched by Compton, Matthias, DuPont's Crawford Greenewalt, Leona Woods and Fermi, who inserted the first slug, the reactor was powered up beginning on 13 September 1944. Over {{the next few}} days, 838 tubes were <b>loaded</b> <b>and</b> the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production. At first all appeared well but around 03:00 the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The cooling water was investigated {{to see if there}} was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor started up again, only to shut down once more.|$|E

5|$|During its review, Sandia {{determined}} that a significant overram of the powder bags into the gun had occurred as it was being <b>loaded</b> <b>and</b> that the overram could have caused the explosion. A subsequent test by the Navy of the overram scenario confirmed that an overram could have caused {{an explosion in the}} gun breech. Sandia's technicians also found that the physical evidence did not support the U.S. Navy's theory that an electronic or chemical detonator had been used to initiate the explosion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} and {{deciding}} game of the 1984 World Series against the San Diego Padres, Kuntz pinch-hit for designated hitter Johnny Grubb with the bases <b>loaded</b> <b>and</b> the score tied at three. Kuntz hit a pop-up to short right field that Tony Gwynn was unable to see. Second baseman Alan Wiggins made the catch, {{but was unable to}} prevent Kirk Gibson from racing home from third with the go-ahead run. The Tigers maintained their lead after that, giving Kuntz an unlikely game-winning RBI.|$|E
5|$|In {{the top of}} the eighth, Mueller led {{off with}} a single to right and Nixon {{followed}} with his third double of the game. Jason Isringhausen came in to pitch for the Cardinals with the bases <b>loaded</b> <b>and</b> nobody out, and was able the finish the inning without allowing a run to score. Kevin Millar pinch hit for the Red Sox starting pitcher Lowe during this inning. It was the third straight game in which the Red Sox starting pitcher had not allowed an earned run.|$|E

40|$|Measuring icing <b>load</b> <b>and</b> icing rate are {{important}} parameters for an atmospheric icing sensor. A new icing sensor {{has recently been}} designed and developed at Narvik University College for measuring atmospheric icing rate, icing <b>load</b> <b>and</b> icing type. Unlike the existing atmospheric icing sensors commercially available in market, which uses the axial loading for measuring icing <b>load</b> <b>and</b> icing rate, this new sensory system measures icing <b>load</b> <b>and</b> icing rate using the torque loading physics.

5|$|The Königsberg-class cruisers had a {{standard}} crew of 21officers and 493enlisted men. This later increased to 23officers and 588591enlisted men, and during World War II, the crew size rose to between 820 and 850 officers and men. The ships carried {{a number of}} smaller vessels, including two picket boats, two barges, two launches, one cutter, and one dinghy. The ships were moderately good sea boats, but {{had the potential to}} capsize if internal stores were improperly <b>loaded,</b> <b>and</b> suffered from a slight lee helm. They heeled up to twenty degrees with the rudder hard over. They were nevertheless very maneuverable and lost little speed in a head sea. In a hard turn, they lost up to 20percent speed.|$|E
5|$|They were hauled by two {{or three}} margoulins, men who walked on the towpaths pulling the barge with a harness over their shoulder. It took about 18 hours to pull a barge through the canal. A marinier stood {{on the front of}} the barge {{steering}} it with a wooden pole. Lock-keepers operated the locks and helped manoeuver the barges using a boat hook. Porters <b>loaded</b> <b>and</b> unloaded the barges. They were called crocheteurs after the iron hooks that they used to move bales of goods.|$|E
5|$|To {{implement}} {{the transformation of}} the creature based on its alignment, Alex Evans developed an exporter program to export 3D Studio Max's models and animations, and Roberts created one to import them and apply them to the lion. Each version of the creature was then <b>loaded,</b> <b>and</b> interpolation code was written, as well as a blended animation between two similar ones. The system has a two-way blend: one for the alignment, and the other for how fat the creature is. As there {{was not going to be}} many creatures on one map, the team were able to use CPU resources to run many animations simultaneously on a single creature.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the great}} {{prosperity}} the dock afforded the city, within 20 {{years of its}} construction the Albert Dock was beginning to struggle. Designed and constructed to handle sailing ships of up to 1,000tonnes, {{by the start of}} the 20th century only 7% of ships into the Port of Liverpool were sailing vessels. The development of steam ships in the later 19th century meant that soon the dock simply wasn't large enough, as its narrow entrances prevented larger vessels from entering it. Its lack of quayside was also becoming an issue. Generally steamships could be <b>loaded</b> <b>and</b> unloaded far quicker than sailing ships, and in a cruel twist of irony, the dockside warehouses that had once made the Albert Dock so attractive, were now hindering its future development. Nonetheless the Albert Dock remained {{an integral part of the}} dock system in Liverpool and in 1878 the pump house was built as part of redevelopment that saw the majority of the cranes converted to hydraulic use, whilst in 1899, part of the north stack was converted to allow for ice production and cold storage.|$|E

A fourth unit, Sturzkampfgeschwader 3 (StG 3 or Dive Bombing Wing 3), sent 22 Ju 87s to attack Gosport. The dive-bombers were supported by 157 Bf 109s; 70 from JG 27; 32 from JG 53 acting as close escort; and 55 from JG 2 which was to sweep the Portsmouth area {{in advance of the}} main raid independently. The Ju 87s were based around Caen, too far away for the attacks. So in the morning the Stukas were moved into closer airfields around Cherbourg, right on the Channel coast.

An {{important}} defensive play was on September 20 against the Cubs. With the bases <b>loaded</b> <b>and</b> no outs in the eighth inning, Addison Russell hit a fly ball that Heyward caught running and threw home to catcher Yadier Molina to tag out Anthony Rizzo by two steps, preserving a 4–3 win. In the second game of a doubleheader against Pittsburgh on September 30, Heyward hit his second career grand slam in an 11–1 win, giving the Cardinals their 100th victory of the season while clinching their third consecutive National League Central division title. He also robbed both Francisco Cervelli and Michael Morse of hits in this game.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ninth}} inning, Sad Sam Jones, a 22-year veteran in the American League, {{replaced}} Dutch Ruether, who had replaced pitcher Shawkey. Jones gave up an inside-the-park home run to Thevenow. Thevenow {{had only two}} other home runs in his career, {{both of which were}} inside-the-park and during the 1926 regular season. Jones then walked Douthit and Hornsby and gave up a single to Southworth. With the bases <b>loaded</b> <b>and</b> two outs {{in the top of the}} ninth inning, Bottomley hit a fly ball to center fielder Earle Combs. The Yankees did not score in the bottom of the ninth inning, and lost the game to the Cardinals by a 6–2 score. Alexander pitched a complete game, allowed hits in only two of the nine innings and did not allow a Yankee hit after the third inning. He also had a series-high 10 strikeouts, allowing four hits, one earned run and one walk. Meanwhile, the Yankees' starter Shocker allowed ten hits and five earned runs, including a home run, in seven innings of work. Shawkey had a perfect inning with two strikeouts, while Jones gave up two hits and allowed two walks in the ninth inning.|$|E
5|$|The {{most likely}} {{cause of the}} {{accident}} {{seemed to be that}} the fireworks attached to her balloon had been knocked out of position by a tree as she ascended; possibly the balloon was heavily <b>loaded</b> <b>and</b> failed to rise quickly enough. When she had lit the fuses the fireworks headed towards the balloon instead of away from it; one of them burned a hole in the fabric, igniting the gas. One man reportedly spotted the problem and shouted to her not to light the fuses, but his cries were drowned out by the cheering of the crowd. Later reports suggested she had left the gas valve open, allowing sparks to ignite the gas and set fire to the balloon, or that her balloon was of poor construction and allowed gas to escape throughout the ascent.|$|E

Cumulative distribution function results show that certain combinations of thermal loads with mechanical loads reduce the probabilistic buckling <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> increase the magnitude of the member axial forces for aluminum truss. However, the reverse is true for composite truss due to very low coefficient of thermal expansion and higher stiffness of the composite. Finally, the sensitivities associated with the uncertainties in the structural, material, <b>and</b> <b>load</b> variables (primitive variables) are investigated.
