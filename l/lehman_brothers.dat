5|$|Following its sale to <b>Lehman</b> <b>Brothers</b> in 1995, One Times Square was re-purposed as an {{advertising}} location {{to take advantage}} of its prime location within the square. Most of the building's interior remains vacant (aside from its only major tenant, a Walgreens pharmacy which occupies its lower levels), while its exterior features a large number of traditional and electronic billboards.

Instead, they decided to market the tower as a location for advertising to capitalize on its prominent location within the Square. The entire exterior of One Times Square above the ticker was modified to add a grid frame for mounting billboard signs.|$|E
40|$|My {{interest}} in this research topic {{was inspired by the}} apparently global consensus on the mandate for central clearing in the credit default swaps market. At the first glance, the central clearing mechanism with its central counterparties is the hero who saved many market participants from substantial losses following <b>Lehman</b> <b>Brother’s</b> collapse. It was heralded for debunking the complex interconnection among financial counterparties and resolving <b>Lehman</b> <b>Brother’s</b> positions in a timely and orderly manner. Nonetheless, after coming into the spotlight, central counterparties raise significant concern about their potential to concentrate systemic risk and grown into ‘too important to fail’ institutions. Any collapse of a ‘too important to fail’ institution is undoubtedly disastrous and likely results in a cascade of defaults by other market participants. Therefore, it is highly questionable whether central clearing can ultimately maintain and protect the market robustness and sustainability. It is even criticised as the Maginot Line of the financial market for being a costly but inefficient bulwark and creating a “false sense of security”. Therefore, this research paper aims to address the aforementioned concern, whether the central clearing regime should be promoted to mitigate the counterparty risk even when it simultaneously propagates another type of systemic risk to the financial market. As the legal framework and the risk management practices of CCP have not been battle test, it is impossible to reach any final and ex post conclusion on the ultimate efficiency of CCP. Nevertheless, historically CCP managed to withstand severe market distress whereas currently policymakers and regulators are spending increasing efforts on addressing and mitigating the systemic risk concentrated through CCP. Compared to other alternative clearing infrastructures, it is evident that central clearing is the optimal approach to address the counterparty risk and to enhance the market stability. Further, the research demonstrates that despite central counterparties’ potential to concentrate and re-distribute systemic risk, their shortcomings and contagious fallouts are not insurmountable. They can be efficiently controlled and mitigated through the implementation of adequate regulations and supervision...|$|R

50|$|UK {{regulators}} {{announced a}} temporary ban on short-selling of financial stocks on September 18, 2008. Short-selling {{is a method}} of profiting when a stock declines in value. When large, speculative short-sale bets accumulate against a stock or other financial asset, the price can be driven down. Short sales were among the causes blamed for rapid price declines in <b>Lehman</b> <b>Brother's</b> stock price prior to its bankruptcy. On September 19 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) followed by placing a temporary ban of short-selling stocks of financial institutions. In addition, the SEC {{made it easier for}} institutions to buy back shares of their institutions. The halt of short-selling in the US was set to expire on October 2, but was extended until it expired at 11:59PM EDT on October 8. The action was based on the view that short selling in a crisis market undermines confidence in financial institutions and erodes their stability.|$|R

In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices.

The aim of the paper is to verify this predictive power of the yield curve for the European Union at 16 countries in the 1995 - 2008 years. With this regard we propose two VAR models. The former is derived from the standard approach, the later is an extended version considering explicitly the macroeconomic effects of the risk premium. We propose the estimates of the models and their out-of-sample forecasts through both the European Union GDP (Gross Domestic Product) quarterly series and the European Union IPI (Industrial Production Index) monthly series. We show that the our extended model performs better than the standard model and that the out-of-sample forecasts of the IPI monthly series are better than ones of the GDP quarterly series. Moreover the out-of-sample exercises seems us very useful because they show the crowding out arising from <b>Lehman</b> <b>Brother’s</b> unexpected crash and the becoming next fine tuning process. ...|$|R

40|$|Starting with <b>Lehman</b> <b>Brother’s</b> demise in September 2008, the Brazilian real fell 42 % vis-à-vis the US dollar. Such large {{exchange}} rate depreciation would typically cheer exporters up. However, {{it was later}} found that many export firms, including multibillion dollar ones, had suffered large financial losses. These capital losses came not from garden variety currency mismatches, but from complex derivative products. We analyze the problems created by this misuse of derivatives by export companies in Brazil in 2008. Besides a careful description of the most relevant cases and of the derivative that caused the problems, we also present evidence that the derivative was not used as a hedge, but as a speculative instrument. The Brazilian case—just one among many where export firms in emerging markets sold USD short much beyond the point necessary to hedge their USD revenues—shows {{that the benefits of}} international reserves accumulation by the government may be jeopardized by perverse incentives generated to the private sector.

40|$|The {{financial}} markets across globe have become distinctly integrated owing to liberalization and globalsiation policy {{as well as}} advancement of information technology. The contagion effect of macroeconomic disturbances or financial crisis, internally and externally, is rapidly disseminating across various economies. The recent global recession of 2007 - 09 started with US subprime crises and subsequently followed by <b>Lehman</b> <b>brother</b> crisis affected all most all major economies of the world. In this contenxt, the present paper explores the stock market integration of leading stock exchanges across various countries during pre and post economic crisis of 2007 - 09.

Further efforts have also been made to examine changing pattern of relationship among stock prices using bivariate and multivariate cointegration techniques. The study suggests that although stock markets are integrated globally, the integration is very weak. This proposes that stock prices as well as returns are not strongly interrelated across markets.

40|$|Following {{the episodes}} of WorldCom, Enron, Parmalat, <b>Lehman</b> <b>Brother,</b> Nortel (in Canada), {{corporate}} governance {{and its impact}} on shareholder value has been brought into the forefront of the debate. Studies on the relationship between corporate governance and the performance of firms to date suggest a positive association between corporate governance and various measures of performance of companies. Unlike the widely dispersed ownership in countries like United States and United Kingdom, the ownership of companies in Canada is concentrated a controlling shareholder (usually a wealthy family) owns majority of the equity and ownership of firms. In Canada studies on the relationship between corporate governance and various performance indicators of firms are mixed. The present study examines the relationship between corporate governance and firm performance in Canada using financial performance data of 152 firms in 2009 and corporate governance ranking of those firms. The empirical results based on regression (ordinary least squares) showed that an overall corporate governance variable has a positive impact on firm's performance in Canada. These results are invariant to the choice of firm performance indicators like Return on Asset (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE). These results are broadly in conformity with earlier studies (although there were mixed results in earlier empirical investigation). These results are also interesting given the fact that Canadian ownership structure is more concentrated. Most of the Canadian companies are listed also in US markets and that provides impetus for corporate governance practices to be implemented in Canada as well. Given these facts, the empirical results are not surprising. Apart from these facts, these results are based on data set of 152 Canadian companies for 2009 only there is need for more empirical verification and calibration.

In 1989, KKR closed in on a $31.1 billion takeover of RJR Nabisco. It was, at that time and for over 17 years following, the largest leverage buyout in history. The event was chronicled in the book (and later the movie), [...] KKR would eventually prevail in acquiring RJR Nabisco at $109 per share marking a dramatic increase from the original announcement that Shearson Lehman Hutton would take RJR Nabisco private at $75 per share. A fierce series of negotiations and horse-trading ensued which pitted KKR against Shearson Lehman Hutton and later Forstmann Little & Co. Many of the major banking players of the day, including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers, and Merrill Lynch were actively involved in advising and financing the parties. After Shearson Lehman's original bid, KKR quickly introduced a tender offer to obtain RJR Nabisco for $90 per share – a price that enabled it to proceed without the approval of RJR Nabisco's management. RJR's management team, working with Shearson <b>Lehman</b> and Salomon <b>Brothers,</b> submitted a bid of $112, a figure they felt certain would enable them to outflank any response by Kravis's team.
