50|$|The deerstalker is {{most often}} made of cloth, often a light or heavy wool tweed, {{although}} deerstalkers made of suede, white cotton duck and even denim are not unknown. The cap is made of six (or eight) triangular panels with rounded sides which are sewn together. If {{the sides of the}} panels are cut in a way giving them slightly rounded shoulders midway, the crown will become more squared and flatter rather than hemispherical. The cap may be deep or shallow, barely touching the tops of the ears, according to the whim of the hatter. Either way it is usually lined with an inner cap of satin, polished cotton or similar <b>lining</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Occasionally one can find a deerstalker with a lightly quilted satin lining. The deerstalker's main features are a pair of bills or visors worn in front and rear. These are usually stiffened with pasteboard, cardboard or layers of heavy canvas.|$|E
50|$|B. Cohen & Co. {{pioneered the}} use of these {{synthetic}} fabrics as lining materials and took the market by storm as expensive silk was substituted for these new fabrics. By the 1950s, B. Cohen & Co. along with Collins and Cawthorn, were the foremost merchant converters in Europe, with ranges of <b>lining</b> <b>fabrics</b> woven and dyed to their own specification. The major supplier of loom state fabric to both companies was Carrington & Dewhurst of Eccleston near Chorley; who were also innovators in the production of cellulosic and synthetic fibres. These complex fabrics were dyed by Thomas Robinson, a traditional northern dye house owned by B. Cohen & Co at Ramsbottom, Lancashire. Thomas Robinson with the help of ICI had developed nylon and polyester and then futuristic spun fabric blends of viscose and acetate. With their fine silk handle and vibrant colour these fabrics proved to be ideal for lining garments. It is estimated that around 1,700,000,000 garments were made with linings sold under the brand name Morada.|$|E

30|$|The {{direction}} of pant <b>lining</b> <b>fabric</b> used was a cross grain (92.3 %, 12 out of 13). This {{is because it}} has several benefits. The cross grain direction has less shrinkage than a lengthwise direction. In addition, the selvage of <b>lining</b> <b>fabric</b> {{can be used for}} hemming of the pants lining without an additional overlocking process, saving both time and fabric consumption. Interesting results were obtained in contrast to that of the women’s pants and other garments, which used the selvage direction as vertical use of grain in a traditional manner.|$|R
30|$|As {{illustrated}} above, most menswear brands {{provided the}} pants lining pattern to the garment factories. The pants style (suit pants and casual pants), {{as well as}} both circumference and length ease were important factors. The connecting method was overlocking the <b>lining</b> <b>fabric</b> onto the outer shell fabric. The direction of the <b>lining</b> <b>fabric</b> used was crosswise grain line, which {{is in contrast to}} the information for the womenswear manufacturers and designers. Therefore, {{the results of this study}} could be a great asset for new menswear and womenswear manufacturers and fashion designers.|$|R

They were all white, plain weave, light-weight and commonly-sold <b>lining</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The experimental fabrics were analyzed for their basic characteristics such as fabric count, weight, thickness, twist and yarn number to find out the possible relationship which existed between these characteristics and the serviceability properties. Standard test methods of the American Society for Testing Materials and the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists were conducted under the standard atmospheric conditions. Analysis of variance and correlation coefficients were calculated for data obtained from all tests. <b>Lining</b> <b>fabrics</b> were ranked in terms of fiber content for each fabric performance test. Polyester showed great resistance to abrasion, high yarn and fabric breaking strength and little dimensional change. Rayon showed great resistance to tearing and good yarn and fabric breaking strength. Cotton had good resistance to abrasion and the least yarn slippage at the seams. Acetate consistently ranked the lowest in the majority of serviceability tests. Since linings with different fiber components did not always rank in the same order in all tests, it would be desirable for the consumer to determine what serviceability qualities she desires most...|$|E
30|$|<b>Lining</b> <b>fabrics</b> are {{typically}} {{made in a}} lighter weight and smoother texture than the outer shell fabric. Generally, the <b>lining</b> <b>fabrics</b> do not stretch, but occasionally, a stretchable garment will be lined with a stretch lining fabric (Knowles 2006). If the degree of stretch in the lining fabric {{is less than the}} outer shell fabric, the lining pattern size is increased from the outer shell pattern (Kim and Suh 2007). The amount of increase in overall size for non-stretch fabric lining patterns from the non-stretch outer shell patterns results in a pattern piece larger than the non-stretch outer shell fabric. The non-stretch outer shell pattern size is larger than the stretch outer shell fabric pattern size to accommodate for more ease in the garment.|$|E

The pant style (suit or casual) {{and the outer}} shell fabric’s degree of stretch were important factors {{with regards to the}} patternmaking method of the pants lining. The sewing method of pants lining has several steps. For example, attaching the <b>lining</b> <b>fabric</b> onto the outer shell fabric using an overlocking stitch must be done first. Then, the sewing of both layers together can be done to construct the remainder of the pant. Interestingly, it was noted that the direction of the grain line was crosswise instead of lengthwise for the <b>lining</b> <b>fabric.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} linings on comfort were {{investigated}} for pleasantness in texture and movement performance in stretch pants. We conducted wearing tests {{in two different}} patterns. At first, comfort of six same stretch pants, five with different <b>lining</b> <b>fabrics</b> and one with no lining, was compared, Then, another waring test was conducted to compare comfort {{in order to obtain}} data on appropriate selection of linings for closer and looser fitting designs, The results were as follows: 1) Stretch pants with linings gained higher evaluation than pants without linings, in terms of pleasantness in texture, slipperiness on the skin and easiness of body movement. The results revealed that the use of <b>lining</b> <b>fabrics</b> improved the comfort of stretch pants. 2) For pants with relatively sufficient ease, it was revealed that the use of supple and smoothsurfaced linings produced more pleasantness to the skin. It was also revealed that easier vertical slipperiness of the lining towards the body deformation improved mobility. Since human body stretches vertically when in action, less vertical friction with the lining yields easier slippage and mobility. 3) For the linings of closer-fitting pants such as stretch pants, we found that elasticity was more effective than slippage on the skin for maintaining mobility...|$|E

Peel and lap shear mechanical tests on specific samples were then done in order to study the adhesion effectiveness. After the tests, cross-sections of samples were observed under optical microscope to examine the adhesive distribution; moreover, the samples were examined with SEM analysis to evaluate the adhesive invasiveness. Also, a series of removal tests of <b>lining</b> <b>fabrics</b> from an original painting were done in order to establish the method allowing the highest degree of reversibility.

40|$|All seams of {{garments}} shall {{withstand the}} established force {{effect in the}} longitudinal and transverse directions. Resistance to thread slippage along the seam is a major property of fabrics that is regulated by strict guidelines. In many research works, <b>lining</b> <b>fabrics</b> are chosen {{as the object of}} research as thread slippage is the most typical of them. What concerns the reports exploring slippage of linen fabric threads along the seam, just very few papers are available. Studies dealing with the influence made by industrial washing and cyclic load on the defect under investigation, thereby taking into account operational properties of garments are not readily available at all. The objective of the paper is to define the influence of industrial washing and cyclic tensile on slippage of linen fabric threads along the seam. For the research, five 100  % linen fabrics of plain weave have been selected. Control test specimens, unwashed and processed with different washing methods, have been analysed. Cyclic tensile of the test specimens has been carried out by a tensile machine “Tinius Olsen” at tensile force P =  20  N, tensile speed of 12. 55  mm/s, number of cycles of 100. The carried-out testing has demonstrated that industrial washing decreased resistance of linen fabrics to thread slippage along the seam in the most cases. Analysis of the results obtained has shown that cyclic tensile led to particularly significant increase in the seam gap. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} and compare the elastomeric performance and comfort-related attributes of knitted fabrics used in garments for scar management and venous insufficiencies. Pressure garments used for scar management and venous insufficiencies need to provide sustainable pressure to the underlying limb from the time the garment is donned by the wearer to assist in recovery. In addition, fabrics used in the construction of pressure garments must be able to transport heat, vapour and moisture from the human body to the environment, leaving the wearer dry and comfortable. By adding a fabric assembly (two separate pieces of fabric layered on top of one another) to the pressure garment, pressure generating and comfort properties of the garment are expected to be enhanced. Six commercial knitted fabric samples were studied. Their selection was based on a representative sample of fabrics currently used for pressure garments, for scar management and venous diseases. Pressure garments have been comprehensively studied for their material composition, construction, pressure delivery and physiological benefits as single layers in the past, while the amount of research carried out on fabric assemblies is limited. All fabrics were tested in both single layers and as fabric assemblies to compare their elastic performance and comfort attributes. Fabrics&rsquo; physical parameters and structural properties were analysed for mass per unit area, thickness, stitch density, optical porosity and air permeability. The elastic characteristics of the six fabrics were tested at 25 %, 40 % and 60 % strain to determine their properties relevant to pressure generation. In addition, the fabrics were tested for tension decay. The fabrics were also assessed for thermal resistance (Rct) and water vapour resistance (Ret). Additionally, selected fabrics were tested for moisture management properties. It was found that fabric assemblies influenced and enhanced the overall elastic and comfort properties of the single layer fabrics. For elastic characteristics it was found that the most powerful fabrics are the powernet fabrics in both warp and weft direction as single layers. The powernet fabrics are able to generate the most pressure on the underlying limb of the patient wearing a garment made from these, in comparison with the <b>lining</b> <b>fabrics.</b> When a second fabric was introduced as a second layer in a fabric assembly, the power also increased in the warp and weft direction for powernets. For moisture management capabilities, single layer brushed-back powernet had better moisture management characteristics. However, as a fabric assembly the non-brushed powernet paired with the <b>lining</b> <b>fabrics</b> had better moisture management capabilities. Also, a fabric assembly, lining on the inside next to skin, facilitates the removal of sweat from the skin and the evaporation into the environment better compared with powernet when next to skin. For thermal and water vapour resistance non-brushed powernet had the lowest thermal and water-vapour resistance as the next to skin side of the fabric is not brushed and doesn&rsquo;t entrap air which acts as an insulator. Also, as a fabric assembly, the non-brushed powernet next to skin has the lowest thermal and water vapour resistance compared with the lining next to skin and powernet outside. For thermal and water vapour resistance in garment form different segments of the body had different thermal and water vapour resistance, which have to be taken into account at all stages of garment design and engineering...|$|E
