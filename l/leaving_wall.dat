This was done at Rukeyser's insistence, so that WLIW, the secondary PBS station in the New York area, could offer the program to its viewers on the weekend.|$|E

40|$|In Portugal {{there has}} been a {{continuing}} enhancement of fathers’ leave entitlements over the last two decades. Policy goals have underlined the improvement of workfamily balance for both parents and the well-being of the child as well as the promotion of gender equality, in particular through the increased involvement of fathers in child care. The last reform of the parental leave system, in 2009, addressed all these objectives but put a strong emphasis on fatherhood and gender equality by increasing paternity leave to 4 weeks of fully-compensated leave (taken with the mother after childbirth) and, more importantly, by introducing a 1 -month ‘bonus scheme’ in case of gender sharing of <b>leave</b> (<b>Wall</b> and Leitão 2014). info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{similarities}} and differences between three theories for predicting the sound transmission due to the structural connections of a double leaf cavity wall. The first of the theories does not include the effects of the resonant vibration of the <b>wall</b> <b>leaves</b> below the critical frequency. Above the critical frequency, this theory does include the effects of resonant vibration in both <b>wall</b> <b>leaves.</b> The second of the theories does by accident effectively include an empirical correction factor which accounts for some {{of the effects of the}} resonant vibration below the critical frequency, but the theory itself is not valid above the critical frequency. The third of the theories does include the effects of the resonant vibration of the <b>wall</b> <b>leaves</b> across the whole frequency range. It is shown that the first and third theories, although very different, are in very good agreement with regard to the radiation of sound from the receiving room side wall leaf above the critical frequency. This validates this aspect of these two theories. The amount by which ignoring the resonant vibration of the <b>wall</b> <b>leaves</b> alters the predicted sound transmission depends on the damping loss factor of the walls...|$|R
