40|$|In hand reared {{birds and}} mammals, it is {{generally}} considered {{that the development of}} hoarding behavior is the result of an interaction between the development and maturation of the nervous system and learning from individual experience. However, few studies have been done on wild animals. We tested differences in hoarding behavior between captive reared and wild individuals of two sympatric small rodents, Korean field mice Apodemus peninsulae and Chinese white-bellied rats Niviventer confucianus. Our aim was to identify if lack of experience from the wild would result in poorly developed hoarding behavior. The Korean field mice perform scatter- and larder-hoarding behaviors whereas Chinese white-bellied rats hoard food in larders only. Within outdoor enclosures we compared seed-hoarding behavior in reared juveniles (RJ, 40 - 50 d old, pregnant mothers were captured in the wild), wild juveniles (WJ, as young as the RJ) and wild adults (WA, over-winter animals). We found that a lack of experience from the wild had significant effects on seed-hoarding behavior for both species. The RJ-group removed and hoarded fewer seeds than the WJ- and WA-groups. The two latter groups hoarded seeds in a similar way. In the Korean <b>filed</b> <b>mouse</b> the RJ-group placed more seeds on the ground surface than other groups. These findings suggest that wild experience is important for the acquisition of an appropriate food-hoarding behavior (especially for scatter-hoarding) in these species [Current Zoology 57 (6) : 725 – 730, 2011]...|$|R
40|$|Haemorrhagic fever with renal {{syndrome}} (HFRS) is {{an acute}} zoonotic viral disease, caused by hantaviruses. Hantaviruses infect rodents worldwide. They are transmitted to humans by aerosol from rodent excreta. Several hantaviruses {{are known to}} infect humans with varying severity. In Europe, three hantaviruses pathogenic for humans are well documented. Puumala virus (PUUV) carried by C. glareolus (bank vole) and causing a milder form of HFRS (Nephropathia epidemica) is reported throughout Europe and western Russia [1]. Dobrava virus (DOBV) is carried by Apodemus flavicollis, the yellow-necked <b>filed</b> <b>mouse,</b> and {{is associated with a}} severe form of a disease with up to 12 % mortality in the Balkans [2, 3]. Saaremaa virus (SAAV) is carried by Apodemus agrarius, the striped field mouse, and is found in the Baltic and Central Europe causing mild HFRS similar to PUUV infection [4, 5, 6]. The first hantavirus infection was diagnosed in Slovenia in 1952. Both severe and mild clinical courses of the disease have been observed, with an overall lethality rate of 4. 5 percent [7]. We have demonstrated that DOBV and PUUV co-exist in a single endemic region of Slovenia and are capable of causing HFRS with significant differences in severity [2]. Earlier epidemiological surveys indicated that A. flavicollis and C. glareolus, which are common rodent species throughout central Europe, were most often infected with hantaviruses [8, 9, 10]. Notification of all hantavirus infections has been mandatory in Slovenia since 1978. They are reported to regional institutes of public health as HFRS (in the following text, all hantavirus infections caused by PUUV or DOBV will be addressed as HFRS). As of 16 April, 11 sporadic cases of HFRS have been reported i...|$|R

This problem is outlined by the growth of files in our personal inventory, which causes increasing difficulty to find, retrieve and organise files. As part of an EPSRC 1 sponsored project, we move into investigate the automatic association of files by user behaviour. User behaviour is defined by how users interact with desktop applications and <b>files</b> through <b>mouse</b> motions. To evaluate the relationships built on by mouse actions and time, we constructed a windows based prototype tracking system and relationship builder FRUBO (File Relationship User Behaviour Ontology) that tracks the mouse actions passively.

40|$|Abstract Background DNA {{sequence}} polymorphisms {{analysis can}} provide valuable {{information on the}} evolutionary forces shaping nucleotide variation, and provides an insight into the functional significance of genomic regions. The recent ongoing genome projects will radically improve our capabilities to detect specific genomic regions shaped by natural selection. Current available methods and software, however, are unsatisfactory for such genome-wide analysis. Results We have developed methods {{for the analysis of}} DNA sequence polymorphisms at the genome-wide scale. These methods, which have been tested on a coalescent-simulated and actual data <b>files</b> from <b>mouse</b> and human, have been implemented in the VariScan software package version 2. 0. Additionally, we have also incorporated a graphical-user interface. The main features of this software are: i) exhaustive population-genetic analyses including those based on the coalescent theory; ii) analysis adapted to the shallow data generated by the high-throughput genome projects; iii) use of genome annotations to conduct a comprehensive analyses separately for different functional regions; iv) identification of relevant genomic regions by the sliding-window and wavelet-multiresolution approaches; v) visualization of the results integrated with current genome annotations in commonly available genome browsers. Conclusion VariScan is a powerful and flexible suite of software for the analysis of DNA polymorphisms. The current version implements new algorithms, methods, and capabilities, providing an important tool for an exhaustive exploratory analysis of genome-wide DNA polymorphism data. </p...|$|R
30|$|Injections of [18 F]FPyPEGCBT-c(RGDfK) to anesthetised mice were {{conducted}} as described above. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 700  μL of 132  mg/mL meglumine ioxitalamate (Telebrix, 6  % m/v iodide, Guerbet AG, Zürich, Switzerland) to allow abdominal organs discrimination {{and subjected to}} CT scans in a Triumph microPET/SPECT/CT system (Trifoil, Chatsworth, CA, USA). Images were obtained at 80 kVp, 160  μA, and 1024 projections were acquired during the 360 ° rotation with a field of view of 71.3  mm (1.7 × magnification). After 20  min of uptake, PET scans were started for a total duration of 110  min allowing the reconstructions of PET frames of 30 [*]±[*] 10  min, 60 [*]±[*] 10  min and 120 [*]±[*] 10  min of uptake. PET scans were reconstructed with the LabPET software using an OSEM 3 D (20 iterations) algorithm and images were calibrated in Bq/mL by scanning a phantom cylinder. The Triumph XO software, which uses a back-projection engine, was used to reconstruct the CT scans with a reconstruction matrix of 512 and a voxel size of 0.135  mm. Reconstructed CTs were then co-registered with the PET scans using the plugin Vivid (Trifoil) for Amira (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) and exported as dicom <b>files</b> for <b>mice</b> anatomy visualisation. The software Osirix (Pixmeo, Geneva, Switzerland) was used to quantitatively analyse the datasets and generate pictures. PET series were converted to display Standardised Uptake Values (SUV) adjusted to the body weight of the animals and merged with CT sets. Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn on contiguous slides according to CT scans. ROIs were subsequently computed to 3 D volumes allowing the quantification of the [18 F]FPyPEGCBT-c(RGDfK) uptake in the different organs.|$|R

40|$|Male mice emit {{ultrasonic}} vocalizations (USVs) towards females during male-female interaction. It {{has been}} reported that USVs of adult male mice have the capability of attracting females. Although the waveform pattern of USVs is affected by genetic background, differences among strains with respect to USV and the effects of these differences on courtship behavior have not been analyzed fully. We analyzed USV patterns, as well as actual social behavior during USV recording, in 13 inbred mouse strains, which included laboratory and wild-derived strains. Significant effects of strain were observed for the frequency of USV emission, duration, and frequency of the waveform category. Principal component (PC) analysis showed that PC 1 was related to frequency and duration, and PC 2 - 4 were related to each waveform. In the comparison of USV patterns and behaviors among strains, wild-derived KJR mice displayed the highest scores for PC 2 - 4, and female mice paired with KJR males did not emit rejection-related click sounds. It is assumed that the waveforms emitted by KJR males have a positive effect in male-female interaction. Therefore, we extracted waveforms in PC 2 - 4 from the USV recordings of KJR mice to produce a sound file, "HIGH 2 - 4 ". As a negative control, another sound file ("LOW 2 - 4 ") was created by extracting waveforms in PC 2 - 4 from strains with low scores for these components. In the playback experiments using these sound <b>files,</b> female <b>mice</b> were attracted to the speaker that played HIGH 2 - 4 but not the speaker that played LOW 2 - 4. These results highlight the role of strain differences in the waveforms of male USVs during male-female interaction.

40|$|Background: Copy number {{variation}} {{is an important}} dimension of genetic diversity and has implications in development and disease. As an important model organism, the mouse is a prime candidate for copy number variant (CNV) characterization, but this {{has yet to be}} completed for a large sample size. Here we report CNV analysis of publicly available, high-density microarray data <b>files</b> for 351 <b>mouse</b> tail samples, including 290 mice that had not been characterized for CNVs previously. Results: We found 9634 putative autosomal CNVs across the samples affecting 6. 87 % of the mouse reference genome. We find significant differences in the degree of CNV uniqueness (single sample occurrence) and the nature of CNV-gene overlap between wild-caught mice and classical laboratory strains. CNV-gene overlap was associated with lipid metabolism, pheromone response and olfaction compared to immunity, carbohydrate metabolism and amino-acid metabolism for wild-caught mice and classical laboratory strains, respectively. Using two subspecies of wild-caught Mus musculus, we identified putative CNVs unique to those subspecies and show this diversity is better captured by wild-derived laboratory strains than by the classical laboratory strains. A total of 9 genic copy number variable regions (CNVRs) were selected for experimental confirmation by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Conclusion: The analysis we present is a comprehensive, genome-wide analysis of CNVs in Mus musculus, which increases the number of known variants in the species and will accelerate the identification of novel variants in future studies...|$|R

40|$|Flow cytometry (FCM) {{bioinformatics}} is a sub-field of bioinformatics, {{aimed at}} developing {{effective and efficient}} computational tools to store, organize, and analyze high-throughput/dimensional FCM data. Flow cytometers are capable of analyzing thousands of cells per second for up to 40 features. These features primarily signal the presence of different proteins on cells in the bloodstream. Hence contributing large amounts of data towards the big biological data paradigm. The data that a flow cytometer outputs from a biological sample, is called a FCS <b>file.</b> The International <b>Mouse</b> Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) is a collaboration between 23 international institutions and funding organizations. Its aim is to decipher the function of 20, 000 mouse genes. IMPC is doing so by breeding mice with a certain gene knocked out (KO), cancelling the function of that gene. In turn, FCM is {{used to measure the}} immunological changes correlated to this knockout. 	Many tools exist to classify FCS files. However, {{there is a lack of}} tools to conduct unsupervised clustering of FCS files. One goal of IMPC is to compare and contrast KO genes, hence IMPC becomes a prime motivation for this problem. 	As such, this thesis outlines a data processing pipeline used to isolate features for each FCS file. We then test the different types of features extracted on a benchmark data set from the FlowCAP-II challenge, containing data from healthy persons and patients with AML (acute myeloid leukemia). We then evaluate how well these features separate out FCS files of different origin (i. e. healthy vs AML) ...|$|R
40|$|A diverse {{range of}} tools and {{techniques}} can be used to observe the clinical consultation and the use of information technology. These technologies range from transcripts; to video observation with one or more cameras; to voice and pattern recognition applications. Currently, these have to be observed separately and there is limited capacity to combine them. Consequently, when multiple methods are used to analyse the consultation a significant proportion of time is spent linking events in one log <b>file</b> (e. g. <b>mouse</b> movements and keyboard use when prescribing alerts appear) with {{what was happening in the}} consultation at that time. The objective of this study was to develop an application capable of combining and comparing activity log-files and with facilities to view simultaneously all data relating to any time point or activity. Interviews, observations and design prototypes were used to develop a specification. Class diagram of the application design was used to make further development decisions. The application development used object-orientated design principles. We used open source tools; Java as the programming language and JDeveloper as the development environment. The final output is log file aggregation (LFA) tool which forms part of the wider aggregation of log files for analysis (ALFA) open source toolkit (www. biomedicalinformatics. info/alfa/). Testing was done using sample log files and reviewed the application's utility for analysis of the consultation activities. Separation of the presentation and functionality in the design stage enabled us to develop a modular and extensible application. The application is capable of converting and aggregating several log files of different formats and displays them in different presentation layouts. We used the Java Media Framework to aggregate video channels. Java extensible mark-up language (XML) package facilitated the conversion of aggregated output into XML format. Analysts can now move easily between observation tools and find all the data related to an activity. The LFA application makes new analysis tasks feasible and established tasks much more efficient. Researchers can now store multiple log file data as a single file isolate and investigate different doctor-computer-patient interaction...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of genetically}} {{modified}} (GM) mice for biomedical research has tremendously increased since 1980 ’s. Housing the rapidly expanding number of mouse lines has become a problem and specific lines were even accidentally lost {{due to the lack}} of space or loss of fertility during breeding for maintenance. Cryopreservation is a strongly recommended approach to solve these problems, also from an ethical point of view. There are also technical risks by small-scale breeding, including genetic drift, microbiological or genetic contamination, disease, or large-scale disasters. The investigations presented in this thesis focus on cryopreservation of mouse ovaries to maintain the expanding populations of GM mice, and the target strains (C 57 BL/ 6, FVB, BALB/c) utilized are those commonly used as the genetic background. The major aim of the research is to develop an efficient, economic and ethically sound cryopreservation and validation protocol for archiving the mutant mouse lines. In chapter 2, a comparison is made of the currently used technologies for cryopreservation of germplasm in mice and the subsequent retrieval of these mutant lines. Detailed managerial information concerning animal use, and time and cost related to these technologies is evaluated. In chapter 3, a cryopreservation protocol for mouse ovaries using high concentrations of cryoprotectants and instrumented ultra-rapid freezing for vitrification is developed and validated by ovary transplantation and subsequent breeding. The robustness of the developed freezing protocol is investigated from various genetically modified lines with different genetic backgrounds (chapter 4). The over-time functionality of the transplanted ovaries is investigated with regard to efficiency in delivering mutant offspring. In chapter 5, the in vivo development of cryopreserved ovarian tissue is investigated by in vivo imaging after allotransplantation. The optimal donor age is also evaluated. The use of a spontaneous albino mutant of the (black) C 57 BL/ 6 as a recipient is also evaluated as a rapid method for identifying the parentage of delivered pup. In chapter 6, the application of transplantation of fresh grafts is evaluated in propagating a subfertile mutant mouse line and the reduced reproduction efficiency related to a particular genetic modification is investigated. Specific attention is focused on the origin of the abnormality. Finally, an overview of the results presented in these studies and their possible implications for future practice and researches are discussed in chapter 7. “There is really no limit to the number of mutant mouse strains that could be generated and expanded to infinity” is practically true in the <b>filed</b> of <b>mouse</b> genetics. Thus, how to manage the mouse colonies in a responsible way is an urgent issue and is an obligated responsibility of researchers. In this thesis, we present the practical information about cryopreservation of germplasm for the management of mutant mouse colonies. The successful application on cryopreservation of juvenile ovaries provides an instant solution to animal facilities that are facing space problems of housing mouse colonies and may also provide useful information to cryopreservation of human ovarian tissue, serving as a model for autotransplantation and studying graft/host interactions in a variety of models for human diseases...|$|R
