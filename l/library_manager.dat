A cute girl introducing herself as Yua—who is the goddess of happiness—comes bursting out of the book, and informs Tomoki that all his happiest memories will be recorded in his diary.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine how {{accessibility}} is handled by the public <b>library</b> <b>managers</b> in selected rural municipalities. We investigated how the concept of accessibility is perceived by <b>library</b> <b>managers</b> in these municipalities and their opinions on local conditions for and solutions to accessibility problems in rural areas. Semistructured interviews were carried out with <b>library</b> <b>managers</b> in six rural municipalities. The results were analyzed using a theoretical model of accessibility. The model consists of five dimensions; physical, social, psychological, organizational and economic accessibility. The study revealed that the <b>library</b> <b>managers</b> perceived accessibility as a complex concept and were of the opinion that circumstances for libraries in rural municipalities are special. Circumstances related primarily to the physical dimension of accessibility, such as distance, and the economic dimension, such as lack of resources. Furthermore, they described the different approaches used to increase accessibility to the users and the analysis revealed that measures had been taken within all the five dimensions. An important finding was that cooperation within the local community and with nearby municipalities was considered crucial by the <b>library</b> <b>managers</b> for providing a high standard of library service in a small community...|$|R
40|$|This article aims {{to analyse}} {{the role of}} <b>library</b> <b>managers</b> as change agent when {{implementing}} Library 2. 0, using transformational leadership and stakeholder management approaches. To do so, {{a case study in}} a Latin American academic library was performed. The experiences acquired for a period of six years were analysed, during which three <b>library</b> <b>managers</b> were involved in managing change. Qualitative data from documents, interviews, and observations were collected, and qualitative analysis methods were used to obtain in-depth understanding of the change process. Results show that lack of transformational leadership and stakeholder management contribute to delayed implementation and limited adoption of innovations. Although <b>library</b> <b>managers</b> recognized the importance of different stakeholders to implement changes, they did not apply systematic and proactive strategies to define and manage them. All in all, <b>library</b> <b>managers</b> should be trained as change agents, with emphasis on transformational leadership and stakeholder management skills. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: This {{paper will}} present a study that explores {{the way in which}} librarians in Turkey use their {{knowledge}} and evidence upon which to base their decision making. Method: One method is to carry out a questionnaire of literature on the subject. The other method is to use analytical data by interviewing <b>library</b> <b>managers.</b> Analysis: The problem of the lack of recognition of the Evidence-Based Library Management (EBLM) concept in Turkey can result particularly in <b>Library</b> <b>managers</b> making uninformed decisions based on on-trend practices. Results:. This study has found that managers and executives of Turkish libraries have inadequate knowledge of the EBLM concept. <b>Library</b> <b>managers</b> need to consider and plan for practical steps that could be taken to introduce the concept of evidence based practice in their decision-making process. Conclusion: <b>Library</b> <b>managers</b> will {{have to be able to}} learn to change from a culture of institution-based decision making to an evidence-based decision making process based on analytics and concrete results...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} master {{thesis is}} to examine how <b>library</b> <b>managers</b> have handled {{situations}} involving controversial lectures at their libraries. Lately, controversial lectures have upset public opinion and caused critical writing in local newspapers. Questions posed are: How do <b>library</b> <b>managers</b> handle controversial lectures, concerning freedom of speech, library directives and respect for human rights? The theoretical starting-point is Joacim Hansson’s definition of two ideological views on libraries, one educational and one liberal, and also an article about thoughts in post-modernism and modernism by Emily Knox. I have used the theoretical framework to define two ideological standpoints; the perspective of freedom and the perspective of responsibility, to illustrate {{the views of the}} informants. Semistructured interviews with <b>library</b> <b>managers</b> were conducted, and the results show that the informants more often expressed views close the perspective of freedom, than views close to the perspective of responsibility. The conclusion {{is that there is no}} complete consensus on how to interpret and follow the many directives being applicable to Swedish libraries. Public opinion and the risk of receiving criticism seem to have an important influence on decisions concerning controversial lectures. However, the study shows that both the perspective of freedom and the perspective of responsibility, in dealing with controversial speech, can be motivated by <b>library</b> <b>managers</b> in terms of acting in line with democratic values and library directives...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2009. This {{study has}} been {{undertaken}} to determine and examine the managerial competencies required by <b>library</b> <b>managers</b> at different managerial levels in effectively managing change in university libraries in South Africa. South African universities have experienced {{a large number of}} changes since 1994 which have inevitably affected the libraries of these universities. <b>Library</b> <b>managers</b> have been faced with a number of challenges. The study includes a literature review which highlights the findings that <b>library</b> <b>managers</b> in university <b>libraries</b> in South Africa, are not prepared to manage change. The literature review also identifies the competencies that are required to manage change. These are: • Communication • Planning and administration • Teamwork • Strategic action • Global awareness • Self-management. The following management functions are also highlighted in the literature review: • Job descriptions • Job/person specifications • Human resource planning • Recruitment and selection of staff • Staff appraisal • Staff training and development. Questionnaires were used to gather data from the population of the study. The data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS) Version 15. The main findings of the study are: • <b>Library</b> <b>managers</b> in the university libraries are not equipped to manage change • First line managers do not require any of the competencies to manage change. • Middle managers require communication competencies and teamwork competencies. • Communication competencies, planning and administration competencies, teamwork competencies and strategic action competencies are required by senior managers to manage change. Based on the descriptive statistics and the hypotheses tested, this study provides a basis for a model that identifies the competencies and managerial functions that are required by the different managerial levels to manage change in university libraries in South Africa. Recommendations include that: • Library schools introduce a module on change management • Competencies to be work shopped to all levels of <b>library</b> <b>managers</b> • Structured training needs to be undertaken that cover all managerial functions • A management qualification must become a minimum requirement for all managerial jobs in university libraries • All senior managers should at least have a management major in their first degree or a Master of Business Administration (MBA) ...|$|R
