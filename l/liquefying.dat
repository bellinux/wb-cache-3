5|$|By {{the late}} 19th century {{scientists}} realized that air could be liquefied and its components isolated by compressing and cooling it. Using a cascade method, Swiss chemist and physicist Raoul Pierre Pictet evaporated liquid sulfur dioxide {{in order to}} liquefy carbon dioxide, which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it. He sent a telegram on December 22, 1877 to the French Academy of Sciences in Paris announcing his discovery of liquid oxygen. Just two days later, French physicist Louis Paul Cailletet announced his own method of <b>liquefying</b> molecular oxygen. Only {{a few drops of}} the liquid were produced in each case and no meaningful analysis could be conducted. Oxygen was liquified in a stable state {{for the first time on}} March 29, 1883 by Polish scientists from Jagiellonian University, Zygmunt Wróblewski and Karol Olszewski.|$|E

25|$|Faraday worked {{extensively}} {{in the field of}} chemistry, discovering chemical substances such as benzene (which he called bicarburet of hydrogen) and <b>liquefying</b> gases such as chlorine. The <b>liquefying</b> of gases helped to establish that gases are the vapours of liquids possessing a very low boiling point and gave a more solid basis to the concept of molecular aggregation. In 1820 Faraday reported the first synthesis of compounds made from carbon and chlorine, C2Cl6 and C2Cl4, and published his results the following year. Faraday also determined the composition of the chlorine clathrate hydrate, which had been discovered by Humphry Davy in 1810. Faraday is also responsible for discovering the laws of electrolysis, and for popularizing terminology such as anode, cathode, electrode, and ion, terms proposed in large part by William Whewell.|$|E

40|$|Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) sawdust {{was used}} to produce <b>liquefied</b> wood by the polyhydric method with acid catalysis. The process was {{optimized}} to produce the highest amount of <b>liquefied</b> wood. Wood <b>liquefied</b> at 160 ºC for 90 min {{was used in the}} adhesion tests. The bond strength of veneer glued with urea-formaldehyde and melamine-urea-formaldehyde resins and several mixtures of <b>liquefied</b> wood with urea- formaldehyde and melamine-urea-formaldehyde wasevaluated by automated bonding evaluation system. With the increase in <b>liquefied</b> wood content the bond strength decreased. Nevertheless for 20 % <b>liquefied</b> wood the reduction of internal bond strength is relatively small and still within the minimum standards required. When 70 % of <b>liquefied</b> wood is employed there is a significant decrease in bond strength. In conclusion it is possible to use a small amount of maritime pine sawdust <b>liquefied</b> wood as a partial substitute of urea-formaldehyde and melamine-urea-formaldehyde resins in the particleboard production, thus decreasing the formaldehyde content. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{formulae}} are deduced for the floatation {{response of}} pipeline buried in <b>liquefied</b> soil. The beam model {{based on the}} theory of beam on elastic foundation {{is used for the}} pipeline buried in non-liquefied and <b>liquefied</b> soil. The soil property is nonlinear, the floating force induced by the soil liquefaction is related to the position of pipeline, is nonlinear also. For the convenience and simplification of analysis, the nonlinear increment element method was used and lots of numerical analysis was conducted, including: the floatation response of pipeline buried in homogeneous soil, the floatation response of pipeline buried in non-homogeneous soil, and the floatation response of pipeline buried in discontinuous <b>liquefied</b> area. The influential factors on the floatation response of buried pipeline buried in <b>liquefied</b> soil including spring stiff of <b>liquefied</b> soil, the initial deformation, the length of <b>liquefied</b> area, the axial force acting on the pipeline, the material of pipeline, and the diameter of pipeline. The calculation results of discontinuous <b>liquefied</b> area draw a significant conclusion that for a long <b>liquefied</b> area, to make the soil non-liquefied in the middle of <b>liquefied</b> area may decrease the length of <b>liquefied</b> area and reduce the flotation displacement of pipeline greatly...|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{floaters}} is shrinkage of the vitreous humour. This gel-like substance consists of 99% water and 1% solid elements. The solid portion consists of a network of collagen and hyaluronic acid, with the latter retaining water molecules. Depolymerization of this network makes the hyaluronic acid release its trapped water, thereby <b>liquefying</b> the gel. The collagen breaks down into fibrils, which ultimately are the floaters that plague the patient. Floaters caused in this way tend to be few in number and of a linear form.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{investigation}} board the capsizing of Finn-Baltic was {{a direct result of}} cargo shifting, caused by the bottom layer of the ore concentrate becoming saturated with water and <b>liquefying.</b> When the vessel encountered heavy seas and began to roll, the cargo in the forward part of the hold shifted, resulting in a permanent list of roughly two degrees. When the crew attempted to turn the combination against the wind, a standard procedure in such situation, the remaining cargo moved as a single mass due to the centrifugal force, sliding against the port side coamings and capsizing the vessel.|$|E
25|$|Quicksand forms {{when water}} {{saturates}} {{an area of}} loose sand and the ordinary sand is agitated. When the water trapped in the batch of sand cannot escape, it creates liquefied soil that can no longer support weight. Quicksand can be formed by standing or (upwards) flowing underground water (as from an underground spring), or by earthquakes. In the case of flowing underground water, {{the force of the}} water flow opposes the force of gravity, causing the granules of sand to be more buoyant. In the case of earthquakes, the shaking force can increase the pressure of shallow groundwater, <b>liquefying</b> sand and silt deposits. In both cases, the liquefied surface loses strength, causing buildings or other objects on that surface to sink or fall over.|$|E

Faraday was specifically involved in the study of chlorine; he discovered two new compounds of chlorine and carbon. He also conducted the first rough experiments on the diffusion of gases, a phenomenon that was first pointed out by John Dalton. The physical importance of this phenomenon was more fully revealed by Thomas Graham and Joseph Loschmidt. Faraday succeeded in <b>liquefying</b> several gases, investigated the alloys of steel, and produced several new kinds of glass intended for optical purposes. A specimen of one of these heavy glasses subsequently became historically important; when the glass was placed in a magnetic field Faraday determined the rotation of the plane of polarisation of light.

25|$|The {{physiological}} function of KLK3 is {{the dissolution of}} the coagulum, the sperm entrapping gel composed of semenogelins and fibronectin. Its proteolytic action is effective in <b>liquefying</b> the coagulum so that the sperm can be liberated. The activity of PSA is well regulated. In the prostate it is present as an inactive pro-form which is activated through the action of KLK2, another kallikrein-related peptidase. In the prostate, zinc ion concentrations are ten times higher than in other bodily fluids. Zinc ions have a strong inhibitory effect on the activity of PSA and on that of KLK2, so that PSA is totally inactive. Further regulation is achieved through pH variations. Although its activity is increased by higher pH, the inhibitory effect of zinc also increases. The pH of semen is slightly alkaline and the concentrations of zinc are high. On ejaculation, semen is exposed to the acidic pH of the vagina, due to the presence of lactic acid. In fertile couples, the final vaginal pH after coitus approaches the 6-7 levels, which coincides well with reduced zinc inhibition of PSA. At these pH levels, the reduced PSA activity is countered by a decrease in zinc inhibition. Thus, the coagulum is slowly liquefied, releasing the sperm in a well regulated manner.|$|E

40|$|<b>Liquefied</b> wood is a {{potential}} alternative to the synthetic adhesives which are used for the bonding of wood. Despite the ability of <b>liquefied</b> wood to self-crosslink, bonds formed during the bonding of wood with <b>liquefied</b> wood do not achieve sufficient shear strength and have poor resistance to water.

It was found that the chemical curing of <b>liquefied</b> wood started after water and solvent had been removed from it. When bonding wood, the curing of <b>liquefied</b> wood takes place faster because, in addition to evaporation, the transition of both vaporous components from the <b>liquefied</b> wood to the lamellas also occurs. During the bonding of 5 mm thick beech lamellas with <b>liquefied</b> wood having a negative pH, at optimal bonding conditions (180 °C, 12 min), a specific type of bond was formed.

2500|$|There are two {{processes}} for <b>liquefying</b> natural gas in large quantities.
