25|$|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has {{an active}} missionary program. Young men {{between the ages}} of {{eighteen}} and twenty-five are encouraged to prepare themselves to serve a two-year, self-funded, full-time proselytizing mission. Young women who desire to serve as missionaries can serve starting at the age of nineteen, for one and a half years. Retired couples also have the option of serving a mission. Missionaries typically spend two weeks in a Missionary Training Center (or two to three months for those <b>learning</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>language)</b> where they study the scriptures, learn new languages when applicable, prepare themselves to teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and learn more about the culture and the people among whom they will be living. As of January 2014, the LDS Church has over 80,000 missionaries worldwide and over 10,000 Welfare Services Missionaries.|$|E
25|$|While some whites {{responded with}} {{violence}} or exploitation of Mexicans, another recurring effort was Americanization. Since many Mexicans were now {{a part of}} the United States, it was expected that they would act like Americans. The national language in the U.S. is English, so it was thought that the Mexican Americans should be speaking English like the rest of Americans. In 1907, United States’ President Theodore Roosevelt wrote, “We have room for but one language in this country, and that is the English language, for we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, of American nationality, and not as dwellers in a polyglot boarding house”. It was clear that a lot of Americans were hostile towards Spanish speaking Mexicans. The English Only movement is a political movement for establishing English as the only official language in the U.S., and using only English in official government operations. <b>Learning</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>language</b> as an adult is a very difficult thing to do, so this effect of imperialism was challenging for a lot of new Americans.|$|E
2500|$|Some EVP enthusiasts {{describe}} {{hearing the}} words in EVP as an ability, much like <b>learning</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>language.</b> [...] Skeptics suggest that the claimed instances may be misinterpretations of natural phenomena, inadvertent influence of the electronic equipment by researchers, or deliberate influencing of the researchers and the equipment by third parties. EVP and ITC are seldom researched within the scientific community, so most {{research in the field}} is carried out by amateur researchers who lack training and resources to conduct scientific research, and who are motivated by subjective notions.|$|E

60|$|This command I obeyed. Every day I practised {{for hours}} in burying forever the old Avis Everhard beneath the skin of another woman whom I may call my other self. It was only by long {{practice}} that such results could be obtained. In the mere detail of voice intonation I practised almost perpetually till the voice of my new self became fixed, automatic. It was this automatic assumption of a role that was considered imperative. One must become so adept as to deceive oneself. It was like <b>learning</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>language,</b> say the French. At first speech in French is self-conscious, {{a matter of the}} will. The student thinks in English and then transmutes into French, or reads in French but transmutes into English before he can understand. Then later, becoming firmly grounded, automatic, the student reads, writes, and THINKS in French, without any recourse to English at all.|$|E

50|$|Learner {{autonomy}} is {{very useful}} in <b>learning</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>language.</b> It {{is much more}} beneficial to learn a language by being exposed to it in comparison to learning patterns of different tenses. According to neo-Vygotskian psychology, which supports the idea of autonomous learning, {{the development of a}} students learning skills is never entirely separable from the content of their learning, seeing as <b>learning</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>language</b> is quite different to learning any other subject. It is important that the students discover the language for themselves, with only a little guidance from their teacher so that they can fully understand it.|$|E

3000|$|When {{developers}} adopt a framework, {{the need}} to <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> programming <b>language</b> adds to the initial learning curve. Most Qt adopters have to <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>language,</b> since Qt uses a proprietary language, QML. According to practitioners, if a developer needs to <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>language,</b> this is <b>a</b> possible negative factor against selecting the framework. This <b>learning</b> curve from <b>a</b> <b>new</b> programming <b>language</b> was also experienced in the student survey. In general, most students were willing to invest in learning: 56.8 % wanted to <b>learn</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> framework during the course. However, some students felt it took too much time to learn QML, {{despite the fact that}} QML resembles JavaScript and thus was designed to be relatively easy to adopt for UI developers. According to one student, [...] "a fundamental issue, like how to add functionality to QML elements, required several hours of brainwork [to learn]". Similarly, some students were not familiar with C++ and reported having difficulties every time they had to write their applications in C++.|$|R

50|$|There {{are also}} views that SMS {{language}} {{has little or}} no effect on grammar. Proponents of this view feel that SMS language is merely another language, and since <b>learning</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>language</b> does not affect students' proficiency in English grammar, it cannot be said that SMS language can affect their grammar. With proper instruction, students should be able to distinguish between slang, SMS language and correct English and use them in their appropriate contexts.|$|E

Activities such as reading, <b>learning</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>language,</b> playing cards and board games and playing a musical instrument can postpone the onset and slow the progression of both Alzheimer's and vascular dementia. The risk decrease is proportional to frequency of activity, with slower cognitive decline being associated with both late-life and early-life increased cognitive activity.|$|E
