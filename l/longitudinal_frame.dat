Strong tie bars extend from the face angle on the transverses to the tank top plating.

5000|$|The barn {{measures}} 58.55 m long, 11.3 m wide, and 11.9 m high, with twelve bays, {{running in}} a north-south direction.

The exterior of the barn is weatherboarded, with a hipped tiled roof. It was originally a much larger structure, with two wings, but the north wing was dismantled in 1774 and rebuilt in the now-demolished hamlet of Heathrow, {{on the site of the}} modern airport. The vast majority of the surviving structure is original; it has been estimated that 95 per cent of the timbers, including the external weatherboarding, have survived from the original building. It has been described by English Heritage as [...] "a supreme example of late-medieval craftsmanship - a masterpiece of carpentry containing one of the best and most intact interiors of its age and type in all of Europe."It is an outstanding example of a late medieval aisled barn and is the largest timber-framed building in England. Barns of this type were based on a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>frame,</b> with two rows of posts connected by arcade plates. Because such barns tend to be both long and high, they experience high structural loads from the wind. They therefore have numerous internal braces, acting in much the same way as buttresses, to strengthen the structure. This gives the barn its distinctive internal appearance, with a lattice of beams and braces holding up the roof. The techniques used in its construction are similar to those employed on the great cathedrals being built at the time, and some of the same craftsmen were probably involved.The barn's main posts are made of oak. Each is about 14 in square and sits on a block of Reigate sandstone, a common building material in medieval London. The posts were cut into shape using axes, adzes and saws, the marks from which can still be seen in some instances. The builders cut and fitted the timberwork together on the ground and scratched Roman numerals, called assembly marks, on the joints to indicate where pieces of timber were to be combined. Some of the pairs of main posts were made from the trunks of very large individual trees which were cut in two. They were all placed upside down, relative to the original direction of the tree. This was because the bottom of a tree is always wider than the top; the greater width was needed to accommodate the joints with the beams that support the roof. Despite the care that the builders took to get the joints right, they may have made some mistakes along the way, as some of the timbers have holes for pegs and mortises that were never used. Alternatively, the timbers may have been reused from another construction.The rows of arcade posts support tie beams, with curved braces to strengthen the frame. The collar beam, which supports the opposing principal rafters, is supported by the crown post. Roof purlins run the length of the barn and are tenoned into the principal rafters, with additional support from curved wind braces. Some aspects of this design are unusual, both in the way that they are executed and in terms of their early date. A number of features in the barn's carpentry are described by English Heritage as [...] "experimental, precocious and regionally unusual," [...] which is attributed to the very high level of skill of the master carpenters who built it.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 In the {{construction}} of a cab-over-engine semi tractor, Freightliner Corporation of Portland, Oregon uses brackets to make the connection between the front leaf spring mounts, bumper, front hinges for the tilt-cab and the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>frame</b> rails. One bracket is used on each side. The integrity of these brackets is essential to the safe operation of the truck. This investigation was undertaken to make an estimate of the stress levels in some special brackets during the various possible load combinations which simulate actual operation. This estimate will be used to justify further more precise measurements of the stresses in the brackets. The geometry of the brackets was too complex to use analytical methods and, also, the prototypes were not available. Quarter scale photoelastic models were built from laminated sheets of epoxy. This kind of model enables one to detect flat plate bending as well as in-plane tension and compression stresses with a reflection polariscope. After the critical load combination was determined from these models, a second model was prepared and stress frozen to determine the magnitude and location of the maximum stress occurring in the bracket. Dimensional analysis was used to relate the model properties to the prototype. The results of this investigation indicated that stress levels higher than the yield strength of the material would occur in the right-hand bracket when braking during a right turn. Strain gages should be applied at the point of maximum stress so that the actual stress in the bracket can be measured for this particular loading condition...|$|E
40|$|Since {{integral}} abutment bridges {{decrease the}} initial and maintenance costs of bridges, they provide an attractive alternative for bridge designers. The {{objective of this}} project is to develop rational and experimentally verified design recommendations for these bridges. Field testing consisted of instrumenting two bridges in Iowa to monitor air and bridge temperatures, bridge displacements, and pile strains. Core samples were also collected to determine coefficients of thermal expansion for the two bridges. Design values for the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of concrete are recommended, as well as revised temperature ranges for the deck and girders of steel and concrete bridges. A girder extension model is developed to predict the longitudinal bridge displacements caused by changing bridge temperatures. Abutment rotations and passive soil pressures behind the abutment were neglected. The model is subdivided into segments that have uniform temperatures, coefficients of expansion, and moduli of elasticity. Weak axis pile strains were predicted using a fixed-head model. The pile is idealized as an equivalent cantilever with a length determined by the surrounding soil conditions and pile properties. Both the girder extension model and the fixed-head model are conservative for design purposes. A <b>longitudinal</b> <b>frame</b> model is developed to account for abutment rotations. The frame model better predicts both the longitudinal displacement and weak axis pile strains than do the simpler models. A lateral frame model is presented to predict the lateral motion of skewed bridges and the associated strong axis pile strains. Full passive soil pressure is assumed on the abutment face. Two alternatives for the pile design are presented. Alternative One is the more conservative and includes thermally induced stresses. Alternative Two neglects thermally induced stresses but allows for the partial formation of plastic hinges (inelastic redistribution of forces). Ductility criteria are presented for this alternative. Both alternatives are illustrated in a design example...|$|E
