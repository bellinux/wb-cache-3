25|$|Mariners' {{compasses}} {{can have}} two or more magnets permanently attached to a compass card, which moves freely on a pivot. A <b>lubber</b> <b>line,</b> {{which can be a}} marking on the compass bowl or a small fixed needle, indicates the ship's heading on the compass card. Traditionally the card is divided into thirty-two points (known as rhumbs), although modern compasses are marked in degrees rather than cardinal points. The glass-covered box (or bowl) contains a suspended gimbal within a binnacle. This preserves the horizontal position.|$|E
2500|$|At sea, a ship's compass {{must also}} be {{corrected}} for errors, called deviation, caused by iron and steel in its structure and equipment. The ship is swung, that is rotated about a fixed point while its heading is noted by alignment with fixed points on the shore. A compass deviation card is prepared so that the navigator can convert between compass and magnetic headings. The compass can be corrected in three ways. First the <b>lubber</b> <b>line</b> can be adjusted {{so that it is}} aligned with the direction in which the ship travels, then the effects of permanent magnets can be corrected for by small magnets fitted within the case of the compass. The effect of ferromagnetic materials in the compass's environment can be corrected by two iron balls mounted {{on either side of the}} compass binnacle. The coefficient [...] representing the error in the <b>lubber</b> <b>line,</b> while [...] the ferromagnetic effects and [...] the non-ferromagnetic component.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>lubber</b> <b>line</b> is a {{fixed line}} on a compass {{binnacle}} or radar {{plan position indicator}} display pointing towards {{the front of the}} ship or aircraft [...] and corresponding to the craft's centerline (being the customary direction of movement).|$|E
50|$|Directional Gyros on {{aircraft}} {{also have}} additional forty-five degree <b>lubber</b> <b>lines.</b> These {{are useful for}} intercepting tracks and making procedure turns.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the true}} heading {{is set at}} the <b>lubber's</b> <b>line,</b> true {{bearings}} are observed directly. Similarly, compass bearings can be observed if the compass heading is set at the <b>lubber's</b> <b>line,</b> etc. However, the vessel must be on the heading to which the pelorus is set if accurate results are to be obtained, or else a correction must {{be applied to the}} observed results. Perhaps the easiest way of avoiding error is to have the steersman indicate when the vessel is on course. This is usually done by calling out [...] "mark, mark, mark" [...] as long as the vessel is within a specified fraction of a degree of the desired heading. The observer, who is watching a distant object across the pelorus, selects an instant when the vessel is steady and is on course. An alternative method is to have the observer call out [...] "mark" [...] when the relative bearing is steady, and the steersman note the heading. If the compass is swinging at the moment of observation, the observation should be rejected. The number of degrees between the desired and actual headings is added if the vessel is {{to the right of the}} course, and subtracted if to the left. Thus, if the course is 060° and the heading is 062° at the moment of observation, a correction of 2° is added to the bearing.|$|R
50|$|In {{appearance}} and use, a pelorus resembles a compass or compass repeater, with sighting vanes or a sighting telescope attached, {{but it has}} no directive properties. That is, it remains at any relative direction {{to which it is}} set. It is generally used by setting 000° at the <b>lubber's</b> <b>line.</b> Relative bearings are then observed. They can be converted to bearings true, magnetic, grid, etc., by adding the appropriate heading. The direct use of relative bearings is sometimes of value. A pelorus is useful, for instance, in determining the moment at which an aid to navigation is broad on the beam. It is also useful in measuring pairs of relative bearings which can be used to determine distance off and distance abeam of a navigational aid.|$|R
50|$|Compasses on sailboats {{may have}} {{additional}} lubber lines at forty-five {{degrees from the}} centerline. This represents about {{as close to the}} wind as the average boat will sail. These lubber lines may be used when sailing close hauled to see if you are on the closest course to your destination, without having to add or subtract the 45 degrees every few minutes, or recalculate your required heading every time you tack. The main line on the compass reads your current (close-hauled) heading and the leeward <b>lubber</b> <b>line</b> will read the bearing to your destination, regardless of whether you are on port or starboard tack. Lubber lines also help you to see windshifts when racing. If you are sailing close-hauled with good trim and you notice that your bearing to the windward mark starts to drift outside the <b>lubber</b> <b>line</b> (angle becoming greater than 45 degrees) you are being headed, and should consider tacking.|$|E

5000|$|In 1928, Gunnar Tillander, a Swedish {{unemployed}} instrument {{maker and}} avid {{participant in the}} sport of orienteering, invented a new style of bearing compass. Dissatisfied with existing field compasses, which required a separate protractor {{in order to take}} bearings from a map, Tillander decided to incorporate both instruments into a single instrument. It combined a compass with a protractor built into the base. His design featured a metal compass capsule containing a magnetic needle with orienting marks mounted into a transparent protractor baseplate with a <b>lubber</b> <b>line</b> (later called a direction of travel indicator). By rotating the capsule to align the needle with the orienting marks, the course bearing could be read at the <b>lubber</b> <b>line.</b> Moreover, by aligning the baseplate with a course drawn on a map - ignoring the needle - the compass could also function as a protractor. Tillander took his design to fellow orienteers Björn, Alvid, and Alvar Kjellström, who were selling basic compasses, and the four men modified Tillander's design. [...] In December 1932, the Silva Company was formed with Tillander and the three Kjellström brothers, and the company began manufacturing and selling its Silva orienteering compass to Swedish orienteers, outdoorsmen, and army officers.|$|E

5000|$|It is to {{be noted}} that the height of the echoes {{increases}} with the distance to the radar, as represented in the adjacent image. This change is not a straight line but a curve as the surface of the Earth is curved and sinks below the radar horizon. For fixed-site installations, north is usually represented {{at the top of the}} image. For moving installations, such as small ship and aircraft radars, the top may represent the bow or nose of the ship or aircraft, i.e., its heading (direction of travel) and this is usually represented by a <b>lubber</b> <b>line.</b> Some systems may incorporate the input from a gyrocompass to rotate the display and once again display north as [...] "up".|$|E
5000|$|A {{bearing compass}} is a {{magnetic}} compass mounted {{in such a way}} that it allows the taking of bearings of objects by aligning them with the <b>lubber</b> <b>line</b> of the bearing compass. A surveyor's compass is a specialized compass made to accurately measure heading of landmarks and measure horizontal angles to help with map making. These were already in common use by the early 18th century and are described in the 1728 Cyclopaedia. The bearing compass was steadily reduced in size and weight to increase portability, resulting in a model that could be carried and operated in one hand. In 1885, a patent was granted for a hand compass fitted with a viewing prism and lens that enabled the user to accurately sight the heading of geographical landmarks, thus creating the prismatic compass. [...] Another sighting method was by means of a reflective mirror. First patented in 1902, the Bézard compass consisted of a field compass with a mirror mounted above it. [...] This arrangement enabled the user to align the compass with an objective while simultaneously viewing its bearing in the mirror.|$|E
