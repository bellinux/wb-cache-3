25|$|Histon Road Cemetery, {{formerly}} Cambridge General Cemetery, is {{a cemetery}} in north Cambridge, England, lying off Histon Road, opened in 1842. It is notable {{as one of}} only three designs by John Claudius Loudon, who covers it in detail in his influential book On the <b>Laying</b> <b>Out,</b> <b>Planting</b> and Managing of Cemeteries (1843); the other cemeteries associated with Loudon are Bath Abbey Cemetery, and Southampton Old Cemetery (where his plan was rejected). These experiences of practical planning directly affected Loudon's writing on the subject.|$|R

50|$|In 1853 {{this led}} to the {{purchase}} of land owned by the 2nd Duke of Wellington, forming most of the Manor of Aldersbrook. The 200 acre of land suited the construction of the cemetery because it was accessible (only 7 mi to the centre of the City of London), had attractive planting and porous, gravelly, well drained soil. This former farm land was sold to the Corporation for £30,721 and the cemetery was founded in 1854. It was laid out in 1855 by William Haywood, who designated 89 acre for burial but also reserved land for plots sold in perpetuity, buildings, landscaping and roads. He was helped by landscape gardener Robert Davidson. In selecting planting, Haywood and Simon were guided by John Claudius Loudon's On the <b>Laying</b> <b>Out,</b> <b>Planting,</b> and Managing of Cemeteries (1843). The total cost is estimated at over £45,000, which is approximately £26,000 more than originally planned.|$|R

50|$|The {{layout of}} the Mackay General Cemetery is typical of that {{employed}} in late Victorian cemeteries both in Australia and Britain, which were strongly influenced by {{the principles of the}} cemetery design movement encapsulated in the book by horticultural journalist, author and landscape architect, John Claudius Loudon, On the <b>laying</b> <b>out,</b> <b>planting</b> and managing of cemeteries (1843). Above all Loudon recommended a practical approach to cemetery design that was responsive {{to the nature of the}} selected site; so on level sites formal layouts of orthogonal grave rows, walks and drives were employed, while on hilly sites broad sweeps were used to ease gradients. Other standard features included a central carriageway lined by evergreen trees, as were other paths in preference to groupings of trees, leading to a focal structure in the centre of the cemetery, use of plant species with some symbolism related to death or mourning, and a grid pattern of graves accessible by paths or roadways. The aesthetic qualities of these layouts represented a shift in the preferred balance of formal and informal elements within the cemetery landscape towards an increased degree of formality and often symmetry, which had a practical advantage in being easier and less expensive to <b>lay</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R

Ford. A striking water fountain, which can still be seen today, was donated by Lady Maple.|$|R

His work caught the attention of former San Diego County Horticultural Commissioner and chairman of the advisory board for the Little Landers, George P. Hall, who encouraged Fleming to study botany. In 1911 he worked in the nursery preparing for the 1915 Panama-California Exposition; during the fair, he became a guide, giving talks on plants and landscaping.|$|R

40|$|In Europe several mapping {{techniques}} {{exist to}} <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> <b>plant</b> distribution. Most of them, however, {{are focused on}} actual and not on potential species distribution range. Spatial predictions become more important for rare and endangered taxa because their conservation is related to existing as well as potential biotopes. The large part of detailed distribution models applies advanced statistics on a large data-set of environmental variables. Data-input availability limits {{the choice of the}} prediction model for species distribution and application of results in a detailed scale. Distribution pattern accuracy determinates its applicability in environmental management (for tracing edges, defining protected areas, etc.). A simple distribution model for endangered taxa is outlined here, based on ecologically homogenous units (land-units) defined with a deductive process. Land-units defined with a hierarchical classification approach are usually employed for modelling phytocoenosis distribution. The spatial model used is based on main structural factors: bioclimate, lithology and landforms. The data set is implemented with land-use information. This model was tested with two case study in Sicily: Erica sicula subsp. sicula and Abies nebrodensis. The former is nowadays confined only to Mt. Cofano (W Sicily) but was reported also from Mt. San Giuliano (Erice) and Marettimo Island (W Sicily), the latter occurs with a natural population of 32 individuals in the Madonie Mountains (N Sicily). This predicting method allowed to identify suitable areas for reintroduction or where the taxa could still occur and floristic investigation should be focused...|$|R
5000|$|The north wing (now the Bishop's House) {{was added}} in the 15th century by Bishop Beckington, with further {{modifications}} in the 18th century, and in 1810 by Bishop Beadon. It was restored, divided, and the upper storey added by Benjamin Ferrey between 1846 and 1854. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1548, Bishop Barlow sold Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset the palace and grounds. These were recovered after the Duke's execution in 1552.In the 1550s, Bishop Barlow sold the lead from the roofs of the great hall. This resulted in it falling into a ruined state.

40|$|The nineteenth century’s {{long term}} {{planning}} and successive construction of new burial grounds and new ways of burial, {{with the help of}} among others scientific, technical and ideological strategies, have been quite successful in institutionalising a consciousness of what a proper place of death should be like. For the architect Augustus Welby Pugin the promotion of a revival of the Gothic style in ecclesiastical architecture and design was, for instance, not merely a matter of style, but rather of principle. The same can be said of the landscape architect John C. Loudon who in an 1843 treatise, On the <b>Laying</b> <b>Out,</b> <b>Planting,</b> and Management of Cemeteries, remarks that a cemetery, after having provided a decent place of burial, should function so as to improve ‘the moral sentiments and tastes of all classes’, with a focus on ‘neatness, order, and high keeping’. New ways of dealing with the deceased has continuously left traces in the space of death. From the churchyard, as the sacred heart of the city, to park-like burial blocks in extra-urban cemeteries, to the more recent practice of strewing the ashes outside the borders of the cemetery, in an environment that is specific to the deceased. Some researchers even speak of a shift: from an institutional to an individual notion of death. An important issue, which often collides with this individualisation of death, is the continual demand of efficiency and order on cemeteries of today pared with the latest requirement - to express spiritual character without religious codes. Hence the space of death can be said to reveal a tension between private and public as well as between sacred and secular interests. As a further example of this tension we may regard the spontaneous sacralisation and personalisation of public space, at the sites of motor vehicle accidents, murders, terrorist acts or other catastrophes, which expresses a strong need somewhat opposite to the current demand for efficient public environments, free from religious and persona-oriented symbols. It also reflects society’s religious structures and social orderings as well as changes in these matters over time. If we as architects and designers are to constructively support and reflect such tensions, needs, and changes I suggest {{it is important that we}} in the twenty-first century start employing an inclusive approach to design strategies. So as to provide more creative ways of defining a place as proper than by excluding that which is improper...|$|R
