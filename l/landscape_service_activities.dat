40|$|The {{wide variety}} of <b>landscape</b> <b>services,</b> e. g. food production, water quality, and recreation, necessitates {{the use of a}} wide range of data sources for their identification. Subsequently, an array of {{approaches}} is required to analyse and map differ different <b>landscape</b> <b>services,</b> which we have explored in this study. Approaches to identify and map four <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> are illustrated for the municipalities Deurne and Asten in province Noord-Brabant, The Netherlands: wetland habitat, forest recreation, land-based animal husbandry, and recreation for hikers. The <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> were identified through ground observations at 389 locations. Spatial indicators were used to identify and map the <b>landscape</b> <b>services.</b> Based on the ground observations, correlations between the <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> and spatial characteristics (e. g. elevation, soil, road-type) were calculated within a neighbourhood with a radius of 0 m, 50 m, and 100 m. These correlations identified several site-specific indicators to map the <b>landscape</b> <b>services.</b> The accuracy of the <b>landscape</b> <b>service</b> maps created was assessed. The indicators proved to be adequately reliable for forest recreation and reasonably reliable for land-based animal husbandry and recreation for hikers. Only <b>landscape</b> <b>service</b> map forest recreation was shown to be highly accurate. The four <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> rarely coincide, but within a 1 km radius it is apparent that some occur closer together. The approach that we have used is applicable for a wide range of different services and establishes a fundamental basis for determining their spatial variation. As such, it should provide vital information for policy makers and spatial planner...|$|R

In particular, in 2011 a bank Foundation (Fondazione Cariplo) has supported the studies for ten proposals and afterwards the activation of six cultural districts in Northern Italy. For this Foundation the cultural district is a territory {{in which there are}} numerous pieces of heritage and of <b>landscape,</b> <b>services</b> and productive <b>activities</b> in synergy one with the others. In this scenario, a group of researchers of Laboratorio TEMa (Politecnicodi Milano) has participated to the definition and activation of two cultural districts in the area of Mantova (cultural district DOMinUS and cultural district Le Regge dei Gonzaga) and, after a start up period, the group is working on their transformation in permanent organizations. Starting from a common bottom-up approach, these two example has been developed following different organization and management models according to the specific local opportunities and resources, to administrative and cultural peculiarities, and also to a diverse participative model.

Results show that milk, and wildlife and <b>landscape</b> <b>services,</b> are substitutes. Moreover, there are economies of scope for only relatively few farms.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{a service}} {{economic}} analysis framework is developed and applied {{in order to}} define, understand, explain and improve <b>landscape</b> <b>services.</b> Together with the ecosystem functions and externalities approach, <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> are understood as intentionally provided targeted outcomes of agricultural production, with the objective to improve landscape quality. Based on this conceptualisation, a five-step analysis framework is developed and applied to analyse the supply chain of three different <b>landscape</b> <b>services.</b> Empirical evidence was collected from two case studies located in France and Austria, whereas the French case study is the national grassland premium and the Austrian case study is on a local landscape scheme. It could be shown that a key strength of the utilised service economic perspective lies in its formalised structure which allowed the identification of involved actors, the organisation of their relation {{and the way they}} are acting within their institutional systems (i. e. how <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> are organised). Moreover, the standardised analysis structure allows for comparisons of supply chains of <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> and helps to identify scope for further improvements, independently from its geographic and administrative context. We conclude with potential risks and benefits of the service economics perspective for <b>landscape</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{theoretical}} and empirical model is developed for analysing the decisions of individual farmers {{whether or not to}} produce wildlife and <b>landscape</b> <b>services,</b> how much of these services to produce and form an environmental co-operative in order to reduce transaction costs or to build up bargaining power. The model is applied for Dutch dairy farmers as the main users of agricultural land in the Netherlands. Simulations show that the reduction of transaction costs makes it attractive for farmers to form an environmental cooperative in case of a fixed price for wildlife and <b>landscape</b> <b>services.</b> Therefore more wildlife and <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> are produced and more farmers are involved compared to a situation with individual supply. If demand is no longer perfectly elastic an increase in wildlife and <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> production leads to lower prices offsetting part of the production and profit increase caused by lower transaction costs. However, if the environmental co-operative acts like a monopolist its bargaining position leads to a decrease in the production of wildlife and <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> and higher prices. wildlife and landscape management, micro-econometrics, transaction costs, co-operation, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R

40|$|The <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> concept {{provides}} a lens to study relations within the social-ecological networks that landscapes are, {{and to identify}} stakeholders as either providers or beneficiaries. However, <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> {{can also be used}} as a boundary concept in collaborative landscape governance. We demonstrate this by analysing the case of Gouwe Wiericke in the rural west of the Netherlands. Here, a collaborative landscape governance process started off with low levels of trust between farmers and regional governments, as a result of previous processes. The introduction of the <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> concept helped to bridge social boundaries, which eventually resulted in collective action: farmers and governments reached an agreement on adapted management of ditches and shores to improve water quality and biodiversity. However, we propose that bridging the social boundaries was achieved not merely due to the <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> concept, but also {{due to the fact that}} multiple boundaries were managed simultaneously, and additional arrangements were used in boundary management...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the {{potential}} impact of an integrated policy package for the Gelderse Vallei region in the Netherlands on seven <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> (residential use, intensive livestock husbandry, drinking water supply, attractiveness for overnight tourism, habitat provision for rare, endemic and indicator plant species, arable agricultural production, and attractiveness for leisure cycling). The spatially explicit methodology focuses on the changes in landscape properties resulting from the implementation of these policies and its effects on the supply of <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> and economic values of the <b>landscape</b> <b>services.</b> After the policy implementation the strongest increase in services supply is expected in rural areas while the strongest increase in value is expected to occur in (peri-) urban areas of the study area.

40|$|Shifting {{societal}} needs {{drive and}} shape landscapes {{and the provision}} of their services. This paper presents a modelling approach to visualize the regional spatial and temporal dynamics in <b>landscape</b> <b>service</b> supply as a function of changing landscapes and societal demand. This changing demand can result from different policy targets. In this paper we conceptualise the system in which these dynamics take place by explicitly addressing (i) the multifunctional character of a landscape, (ii) the different spatial levels at which interactions between <b>landscape</b> <b>service</b> supply, demand, and land management occur, and (iii) trade-offs in service supply as a result of land management actions. Next, we translate the resulting conceptual framework into an operational model. As a demonstration, this model is applied to simulate changes in <b>landscape</b> <b>service</b> supply driven by regional policies in a rural region of the Netherlands. This application demonstrates potential trade-offs, which emerge in a spatially explicit way in the region over time. It illustrates the potential relevance of modelling <b>landscape</b> <b>service</b> dynamics for environmental management and decision makin...|$|R

Many {{of these services}} {{are the result of}} farmers' decision making to allocate resources to other activities than food production and therefore are the result of farm the adoption of on-farm rural activities. With changing agricultural and rural policies, the future provision of <b>landscape</b> <b>services</b> to fulfill societal demands is not guaranteed. This study aims at mapping the spatial distribution of the adoption of on-farm rural activities under different explorative scenarios. For a Dutch landscape, storylines at the landscape scale were developed by combining global storylines, resulting from the Global Environmental Outlook, with local storylines resulting from key informant interviews. Subsequently these storylines were translated into quantitative scenarios that were implemented into a simulation procedure based on spatially explicit econometric models of farmer's decision making.
