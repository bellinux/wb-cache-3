500|$|The Neo-Gothic {{style that}} had become almost {{universal}} for church building {{in the late nineteenth}} century continued in to the twentieth, with examples including L. G. Thomson's Reid Memorial Church, Edinburgh (1929–33). However, the most common forms in this period were plain and massive Neo-Romanesque buildings. Protestant examples included H. O. Tarbolton's Bangour Village Church (1924–30) and Roman Catholic examples included Reginald Fairlie's Immaculate Conception Church, Fort William (1933–34). The reunification of the Church of Scotland in 1929 removed much of the need for new Presbyterian church-building, which was replaced by a tendency towards renovating nineteenth-century churches. The main tendency in church design in the 1930s was a move towards classicism. There were isolated large classical Protestant commissions, such as Bristo Baptist Church, Edinburgh (1933–35), but the major buildings in this form were in the Catholic Church where there was a movement towards worshipper-centred basilican plans, after the pontificate of Pius X (1903–14). This movement reached its peak in the 1960s after the Second Vatican Council. The leading figure in pursuing this style was Giacomo Antonio (Jack) Coia of Gillespie, Kidd & Coia. From the later 1920s he pursued a brick style of Catholic architecture. Coia's first church, St Anne's, Dennistoun (1931), utilised the engineering techniques of Beaux-Arts architecture, resulting in a broad, centralised space, with narrow arcades rather than aisles, with a monumental facade of red-brick. He used a more <b>linear</b> <b>plan</b> in subsequent designs, including St Patrick, Greenock (1934–35). Coia's partner T. Warnett Kennedy's temporary, open-roofed Catholic chapel at the Empire Exhibition (1938) was fronted by a Mackintosh-like grid of metalwork, and with his St Peter in Chains Church, Ardrossan (1938), with austere walls and towers, showed the influence of the [...] "abstract compositions" [...] of contemporary Swedish architecture and pointed to the future influence of modernism.|$|E

From the later 1920s he pursued a brick style of Catholic architecture, pioneered by Macpherson in Edinburgh and combined with the classical tendencies of Fairlie's refacing of St Patrick's, Cowgate (1928–29). Coia's first church, St Anne's, Dennistoun (1931), utilised the engineering techniques of Beaux-Arts architecture, resulting in a broad, centralised space, with narrow arcades rather than aisles, with a monumental facade of red-brick.

The early Christian and Byzantine character of the most striking of these, St Patrick's, was enhanced by carvings by Archibald Dawson. Coia's use of selective details was probably indebted to Mackintosh. Later in the decade Coia took into partnership T. Warnett Kennedy. Kennedy's temporary, open-roofed Catholic chapel at the Empire Exhibition (1938) was fronted by a Mackintosh-like grid of metalwork, and with his St Peter in Chains Church, Ardrossan (1938), with austere walls and towers, showed the influence of the [...] "abstract compositions" [...] of contemporary Swedish architecture and pointed to the future influence of modernism.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} thesis {{focuses on}} the <b>linear</b> <b>planning</b> method. The method is particularly useful when <b>planning</b> <b>linear</b> objects, such as roads, pipelines, tunnels, railways, sewerage {{and in some instances}} multi-storied buildings. The advantage of <b>linear</b> <b>planning</b> is primarily its two-dimensionality. One axis shows time and the other location, which enables a clear comparison between the planned and {{the current state of the}} plan. When using the network <b>planning</b> method, the <b>linear</b> object must be divided into sections, and each section must have a network structure of activities applied. The more sections, the more precise and complex the plan, which can lead to difficulties monitoring the project. Computer support has an important role in schedule-planning. It enables fast updating or correcting the plan, the use of an existing similar plan and working with a distant-access simultaneously. In the program Tilos, which supports <b>linear</b> <b>planning,</b> I analyzed the existing schedule-plan for the Kidričevo- Rogatec pipeline that was made in MS Project. My focus was primarily on the possible mistakes in the existing plan due to the use of the network planning method for <b>planning</b> <b>linear</b> objects, such as collisions and incorrect sequence of activities.

The generated repairs serve two purposes: as they describe possible worlds in which the goal holds, they can be used to reason about these worlds and eliminate those, which have undesired properties. Moreover, the repairs can be used for driving the actual planning procedure such that the generated plans lead to the selected possible world.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a well known problem in AI planning: {{detecting}} and resolving conflicts in nonlinear plans. We sketch a theory of restricted conflict detection and resolution that subsumes conflict handling in classical nonlinear planners. By relaxing the restrictions, we develop a more general concept of conflicts suggesting practical and theoretical limitations of conflict handling in nonlinear plans. 1 The problem Nonlinear planning was invented [Saccrdoti, 1977, Tate, 1977] as a lea,st commitment strategy for operator ordering. A nonlinear plan specifies a strict partial ordering on operators that can be interpreted to represent every linear ordering compatible with it. (Note that NOAH [Saccrdoti, 1977], e. g., uses a specialization of this interpretation as it does not allow every compatible linear ordering but considers ordering whole branches only.) While being efficient in that it allows whole areas of the space of <b>linear</b> <b>plans</b> to be searched at once, nonlinear planning poses a new problem compared to linear planning: one has to decide whether really every linear ordering of operators in a nonlinear plan results in a correct operator sequence to be executed. This is the well known problem of detecting and if necessary—resolving conflicts in nonlinear plans. Of course, conflicts also arise in linear plans: a STRIPS [Fikes et. a/., 1971] plan, e. g., containing {{what we call a}} conflict would simply be incorrect or incomplete. But as <b>linear</b> <b>plans</b> are special cases of nonlinear ones, conflict handling in <b>linear</b> <b>plans</b> proves to be less complex. Although every nonlinear planner has to detect and resolve conflicts in one way or another, there is no coherent theory of conflict handling. Instead, this is described anew for every planner, and it seems that some planner implementors have deviated from the path of generality without mentioning that they have done so. In this paper, we deliver a sketch of a theory of conflict detection and resolution in nonlinear plans. The emphasis is on the coherence of the theory developed; we do not claim all the ideas we present here are new. 2 Th...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the question of}} how a sales manager should design the optimal compensation scheme for his salesforce when it consists of salespersons of varying selling skills, i. e., when the salesforce is heterogeneous. The manager's problem is to reward the salespersons based on observable, uncertain sales achieved by the salespersons. Under the assumption that both the manager and the salespersons are risk neutral, the optimal compensation scheme is derived. It consists of the manager offering a menu of plans, consisting of a quota, a payment for meeting quota, and a constant commission rate for sales above or below quota. Such schemes using constant commission rates are also called menus of <b>linear</b> <b>plans.</b> Salespersons choose the quota which best suits them, achieve sales, and are then rewarded based on their actual performance. This scheme, variants of which are often observed in practice, is shown to be optimal for sales environments characterized by commonly encountered sales response functions, and a large class of frequency distributions of selling skills in the salesforce. The problem is solved using the methods of principal-agent models. The key differences in managing homogeneous and heterogeneous salesforces are highlighted. Finally, the paper discusses the issues involved in practically implementing the optimal compensation scheme. salesforce compensation, selling skill, heterogeneous salespersons, menu of <b>linear</b> <b>plans,</b> principal-agent models...|$|R
