50|$|Jeremy Moon {{became a}} leading figure in British art during the 1960s and 1970s. His work was {{abstract}} and geometric in form. His early paintings until 1964 used oil on canvas, switching {{then to the}} new acrylic paints. He generally applied paint in a flat and unmodulated way using masking tape to delineate clear areas of colour. He was an early exponent of the shaped canvas and also produced {{a small number of}} 3D and relief works. Reoccurring motifs and elements within his paintings included grid-like forms composed of vertical, horizontal or diagonal <b>lines.</b> <b>Drawing</b> was a central part of his practice and he used pencil, pen and pastels incessantly on A4 letter-writing paper to develop ideas for works. His peers included John Hoyland, Bridget Riley, Ian Stephenson, Bernard Cohen, Patrick Caulfield, Phillip King and Anthony Caro.|$|E

5000|$|After a {{great deal}} of touring in both the US and Europe, The Showdown went back to the studio to record their second full length album. This album took a {{different}} direction trading in the screaming double-bassing death metal for a more southern approach mixed with elements of their older style such as heavy guitar riffs, some screams (although not as dominated by them), and distinct bass and drum <b>lines,</b> <b>drawing</b> also from 1980s to early 1990s-era metal like Pantera, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, and Metallica. In the fall of 2006, The Showdown joined the Christian rock/alternative band Pillar on The Days of the Reckoning tour. The tour lasted from mid-October through November 2006 and also featured Christian rock bands Day of Fire and Decyfer Down. In late 2006, after completing the album, Andrew announced he was leaving the band(and possibly to pursue a career in professional wrestling). Andrew was soon replaced by another Andrew - A.J. Barrette of Still Remains. Although the album was already completed, The Showdown along with A.J. hit the studio once more to record the track [...] "Head Down" [...] which would be added to the album before its release. The completed album, Temptation Come My Way was released on February 20, 2007. Unknown to the public until release, two different versions were released, one with the song [...] "Fanatics and Whores", and one without, probably to avoid controversy in the Christian market. This upset many fans who had pre-ordered the CD and received the incomplete album, even though most distributors listed the song in their track listing. Temptation Come My Way received high popularity in the underground culture, and The Showdown was soon signed on March 21 of 2007 to play at Ozzfest 07.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} thirty years since the {{beginning}} of the second wave feminist movement in the US, serious economic changes around have dramatically reconfigured and expanded the global division of labor along racial, ethnic and gendered <b>lines.</b> <b>Drawing</b> from Marxist-feminist theorizing about the division of labor, I argue that a neoliberal global reconfiguration of the division of labor has produced new gendered and racialized identities. In the United States, changes in dominant cultural constructions of gender can be seen typified in one gendered construction in particular???the New Single Woman. In this thesis, I examine important changes in dominant constructions of the ???New Single Woman???, through a case study of the postfeminist television show Sex and the City. My examination of dominant constructions of the New Single Woman situates these postfeminist constructions of femininity within a larger economic and political context...|$|E

40|$|Hatching is a shading {{technique}} in which tone {{is represented by}} a series of strokes or <b>lines.</b> <b>Drawing</b> using this technique should follow three criteria: the lighting, the object geometry and its material. These criteria respectively provide tone, geometric motif orientation and geometric motif style. We present a GPU real time approach of hatching strokes over arbitrary surfaces. Our method is based on a coherent and consistent model texture mapping and takes into account these three criteria. The triangle adjacency primitive is used to provide a coherent stylization over the model. Our model computes hatching parameter per fragment according to the light direction and the geometry and generates hatching rendering taking into account these parameters and a lighting model. Dedicated textures can easily be created off-line to depict material properties for any kind of object. As our GPU model is designed to deal with texture resolutions, consistent mapping and geometry in the object space, it provides real time rendering while avoiding popping and shower-door effects...|$|E

40|$|The {{combination}} {{of the changes in}} the US hospital industry and resulting pressures on the workforce with the relative immobility of hospitals has led to the growth of unions in this industry while unions are losing members in most other industries. In the last four decades the vast majority of US hospitals have become organised into corporate systems along classically capitalist profit-making <b>lines.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on theoretical work that places changing work experience as a major factor in pro-union behaviour, the article will examine how the rise of competition among private hospital systems has led hospital managements to adopt ???lean production??? methods borrowed from manufacturing. The consequent pressures on the workforce have encouraged workers to join unions. These same forces have shaped the content of collective bargaining and divergent styles of unionism. As the transformation of hospitals are a piece of the broader neoliberal era in which they occur, this analysis should be applicable to certain other industries as well...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the politics of}} identification in antiracist struggles and asks how people begin and sustain social movement work across lines of difference. The project follows a series of activists and public intellectuals to sites of conflict in order to explore how actors confront failures in solidarity by summoning people to understand their freedom as bound to antiracist struggles. In work by James Baldwin from the 1960 s and work by three contemporary social movement organizations—Black Lives Matter, antiracist LGBTQ organization Southerners on New Ground (SONG), and immigrant justice organization #Not 1 More—actors construct shared forms of identification across racial lines using kinship language and references to the body. Undergirding these rhetorical and organizing strategies is a concept—boundness—with a history in black political thought; a paradigm in which people’s lives are understood to be co-constituted and their freedom bound together. The first chapter traces the concept of boundness in James Baldwin’s political thought and explores how boundness offers an alternative and embodied way to theorize racial identity, racialized violence, and interracial solidarity. Chapter II examines interviews with James Baldwin in 1963 and #BlackLivesMatter activists in 2014 - 2015 to explore how their overlapping interventions reorient public discussions about racial violence. Chapters III and IV examine how contemporary activists in SONG and #Not 1 More generate shared forms of identification across racial <b>lines.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on archival research and ethnography, this study employs a close reading approach to specific moments in political discourse and organizing to theorize how {{people on the ground}} are crafting and contesting forms of identification. Ultimately, this project offers an account {{of the ways in which}} forms of political identification are structured by ethical and emotional orientations, and contends that contestations over these structures are a primary site of politics.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of five {{individual}} nautical archaeological finds from North Wales. They are the Llyn Peris logboat, Pwll Fanog wreck, Llyn Peris boat, Llyn Padarn boat and the Talsarnau boat. The five vessels are {{used to assess the}} inter-reliability of coefficients and ratios of form. The main body of the thesis consists of a record of the five vessels {{to gain a better understanding}} of their construction, hull form and a general understanding of the boat building tradition of North Wales. Therefore the production of a descriptive catalogue of hull timbers recovered accompanied by illustrations where applicable forms the core of this thesis. The variations in date and location ofthe vessels gives a maritime in-site into the various historical periods and geographical areas of North Wales. Each vessels is considered in its historical context. The inter-reliability and usability of coefficients ofform generated are accessed against McKee's (1989), descriptive variations of form and the Great Lakes historic ships research project classification of form, termed GHLS (Wilson, 1989 : 212). The use of a computer software package, Hull Form 8, to generate the coefficients and ratios ofform is also assessed. The body of the thesis is concluded by a discussion on objectives reached and lessons learnt. It is concluded that McKee's ratio of form are inter-reliable whilst the use of coefficients of form are not. The use ofa computer software package is deemed viable and of use, however certain cautions must be expressed when using such a package. It should be used as an analytical tool and not a design tool. No further enhancement of the archaeological <b>lines</b> <b>drawing</b> should be carried out. A full bibliography and glossary of terms finalises the thesis...|$|E
