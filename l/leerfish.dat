25|$|The giant {{trevally}} is {{the largest}} member of the genus Caranx, and the fifth-largest {{member of the family}} Carangidae (exceeded by the yellowtail amberjack, greater amberjack, <b>leerfish</b> and rainbow runner), with a recorded maximum length of 170cm and a weight of 80 kg. Specimens this size are very rare, with the species only occasionally seen at lengths greater than 80cm. It appears the Hawaiian Islands contain the largest fish, where individuals over 100lbs are common. Elsewhere in the world, only three individuals over 100lbs have been reported to the IGFA.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>leerfish,</b> also garrick (Lichia amia) is {{a species}} of marine fish in the family Carangidae, and is native to the Mediterranean and the coastal waters of western Africa to the coastal waters of eastern South Africa. Also {{recorded}} in the Black Sea These fish can reach 1.5 m in length and 18.8 kg in weight. They inhabit the coastal wave zone where they form small shoals to hunt other smaller fish, favouring Pomatomus saltatrix.|$|E
50|$|The port of Finike {{is now a}} yacht marina, and has a small fishing fleet. The {{coast is}} rich in marine life, {{including}} sea turtles, and fish, including local specialities red porgy (Sparidae) and grouper (Epinephelus); other fish found along the coast include <b>leerfish</b> (Carangidae) and the more widespread Mediterranean varieties such as bluefish, sea bream, sea bass, with swordfish, sardines and others found further out to sea. However, the coast suffers from overfishing, and many varieties, including the porgy, are in decline.|$|E

40|$|A {{specimen}} of the <b>leerfish</b> Lichia off. amia is described from the Messinian evaporite succession of the Vena del Gesso basin, in the Romagna Apennines. The single specimen available is solely {{represented by a}} strongly incomplete left pectoral girdle and a caudal vertebra. The palaeoecological analysis of the <b>leerfish</b> and its associated fish biota suggests thai it represented a top predator in the coastal lagoons of the Vena del Gesso basin, in which it entered opportunistically, attracted by the abundani food resources available. The composition and ecological structure of the fish assemblage indicate that the lagoons of the Vena del Gesso basin were characterized by a brackish waterbody, periodically influenced by seawater inputs. The marine influences evocated {{by the presence of}} the <b>leerfish</b> unequivocally suggest that normal marine conditions occurred close to the coastal lagoons of the Vena del Gesso basin during the deposition of the primary evaporites...|$|E
40|$|Excessive {{truncation}} of a population's size {{structure is}} often {{identified as an}} important deleterious effect of exploitation, yet the effect on population persistence of size-structure truncation caused by exploitation is often not quantified due to data limitations. In this study, we estimate changes in eggs per recruit (EPR) using annual length-frequency samples over a 9 year period to assess persistence {{of the two most}} important recreational fishes in southern Angola: west coast dusky kob (Argyrosomus coronus) and <b>leerfish</b> (Lichia amia). Using a length- and age-structured model, we improve on an existing method to fit this type of model to length-frequency data and estimate EPR. The objectives of the methodological changes are to add flexibility and robustness to the approach for assessing population status in data-limited situations. Results indicate that dusky kob presents very low levels of EPR (5 %- 10 % of the per recruit reproductive capacity in the absence of fishing) in 2013, whereas large inter-annual variability in <b>leerfish</b> estimates suggest caution must be applied when drawing conclusions about its exploitation status. Using simulated length frequency data with known parameter values, we demonstrate that recruitment decline due to overexploitation leads to overestimation of EPR values. Considering the low levels of EPR estimated for the study species, recruitment limitation is not impossible and true EPR values may be even lower than our estimates. It is, therefore, likely that management action, such as the creation of Marine Protected Areas, is needed to reconstitute the west coast dusky kob population...|$|E
40|$|Stable {{isotopes}} {{of carbon}} and nitrogen {{were used to}} test the hypothesis that stomach content analysis has systematically overlooked the consumption of gelatinous zooplankton by pelagic mesopredators and apex predators. The results strongly supported a major role of gelatinous plankton in the diet of bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus), little tunny (Euthynnus alletteratus), spearfish (Tetrapturus belone) and swordfish (Xiphias gladius). Loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the oceanic stage and ocean sunfish (Mola mola) also primarily relied on gelatinous zooplankton. In contrast, stable isotope ratios ruled out any relevant consumption of gelatinous plankton by bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix), blue shark (Prionace glauca), <b>leerfish</b> (Lichia amia), bonito (Sarda sarda), striped dolphin (Stenella caerueloalba) and loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the neritic stage, all of which primarily relied on fish and squid. Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) were confirmed as crustacean consumers. The ratios of stable isotopes in albacore (Thunnus alalunga), amberjack (Seriola dumerili), blue butterfish (Stromaeus fiatola), bullet tuna (Auxis rochei), dolphinfish (Coryphaena hyppurus), horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), mackerel (Scomber scombrus) and pompano (Trachinotus ovatus) were consistent with mixed diets revealed by stomach content analysis, including nekton and crustaceans, but the consumption of gelatinous plankton could not be ruled out completely. In conclusion, the jellyvorous guild in the Mediterranean integrates two specialists (ocean sunfish and loggerhead sea turtles in the oceanic stage) and several opportunists (bluefin tuna, little tunny, spearfish, swordfish and, perhaps, blue butterfish), most of them with shrinking populations due to overfishing...|$|E
