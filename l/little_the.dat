5|$|At {{the end of}} 1967, Nixon {{told his}} family he planned to run for {{president}} a second time. Although Pat Nixon did not always enjoy public life (for example, she had been embarrassed by the need to reveal how <b>little</b> <b>the</b> family owned in the Checkers speech), she was supportive of her husband's ambitions. Nixon believed that with the Democrats torn over the issue of the Vietnam War, a Republican had a good chance of winning, although he expected the election to be as close as in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Cagney made a rare TV {{appearance}} in the lead role of the movie Terrible Joe Moran in 1984. This was his last role. Cagney's health was fragile and more strokes had confined him to a wheelchair, but the producers worked his real-life mobility problem into the story. They also decided to dub his impaired speech, using the impersonator Rich <b>Little.</b> <b>The</b> film made use of fight clips from Cagney's boxing movie Winner Take All (1932), {{despite the fact that}} the TV movie is about an entirely different character.|$|E

5|$|Charles XI {{had complained}} of stomach pains since 1694. In {{the summer of}} 1696, he asked his doctors for an opinion on the pain as it had {{continuously}} become worse, {{but they had no}} viable cure or treatment for it. He continued to perform his duties as usual, but, in February 1697, the pains became too severe for him to cope and he returned to Stockholm where the doctors discovered he had a large, hard lump in his stomach. At this point there was <b>little</b> <b>the</b> doctors could do except alleviate the King's pain as best they could. Charles XI died on 5 April 1697, in his forty-first year. An autopsy showed that the King had developed cancer and that it had spread through his entire abdominal cavity.|$|E

5|$|Moving very <b>little,</b> <b>the</b> {{depression}} was disorganized due to continued shear, leaving {{the center of}} circulation west of the convective activity. By later in the morning hours of May27, the system began to show overall signs of organization, primarily related to a burst of convection in the eastern semicircle. At the same time, the center of circulation either reformed or began to move farther north, possibly north-northeast. Embedded within the steering currents of a ridge, most forecasts anticipated the storm would drift northward for several days, though some computer models predicted the storm would eventually move inland near Acapulco. At 1800UTC on May27, the depression organized into a tropical storm, and as such was named Aletta by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E

5|$|The administration's {{response}} to racial violence was minimal, {{causing him to}} lose black support. When black postmasters at Hogansville, Georgia in 1897, and at Lake City, South Carolina the following year, were assaulted, McKinley issued no statement of condemnation. Although black leaders criticized McKinley for inaction, supporters responded by saying there was <b>little</b> <b>the</b> president could do to intervene. Critics replied by saying that he could at least publicly condemn such events, as Harrison had done.|$|E
5|$|After the {{elections}} {{in the fall of}} 1862, Governor Morton feared that the legislature's Democratic majority would attempt to hinder the war effort, reduce his authority, and vote to secede from the Union. After the legislative session convened in 1863, all but four Republican legislators stayed away from Indianapolis to prevent the general assembly from attaining the quorum it needed to pass legislation, including funding the state government or making tax provisions. This rapidly led to a crisis as the state government began to run out of money to conduct its business and was nearly bankrupt. Going beyond his constitutional powers, Morton solicited millions of dollars in federal and private loans to avert the crisis. To obtain funds to run the state government, Morton turned to James Lanier, a wealthy banker from Madison, Indiana. On two occasions, Lanier provided the state with more than $1 million (USD) in unsecured loans. Morton's move was successful, he was able to fund the state government and the war effort in Indiana. There was <b>little</b> <b>the</b> legislature could do but watch.|$|E

5|$|Roméo Dallaire, from October 1993 to August 1994, {{served as}} the Force Commander for the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda. In January 1994 he passed along {{information}} to the UN from a Hutu informant about a planned extermination of Tutsi citizens and a massacre of Belgian peacekeepers. After the UN denied him permission to protect the informant, or seize any weapons, Dallaire made a plea to the Canadian government who also denied him any assistance. Dallaire continued his pleas to the UN after the genocide began and devised a plans to end the violence. The UN ordered the peacekeepers to withdraw and not interfere. Dallaire, believing the order unethical and unlawful, disobeyed and with 450 Ghanaian soldiers, protected Tutsi hideouts. He received help from non-governmental organizations, foreign journalists, and the Canadian government. With the media reporting on the massacre, the UN authorized 5,500 troops to protect civilians. Dallaire was denied permission to arrest fleeing Hutu leaders. In August Dallaire asked to be replaced after he recognized signs of posttraumatic stress disorder. Once back in Canada, he became appalled at how <b>little</b> <b>the</b> general public knew, and how much the world leaders knew, of what happened. In the aftermath, blame was assigned to various people, including Dallaire, but Off argues that blame lies with the UN and its Security Council who refused to act when called upon.|$|E
5|$|The Persians {{preferred}} a {{battle in the}} open sea, where they could better utilize their superior seamanship and numbers. For the Greeks, the only realistic hope of a decisive victory was to draw the Persians into a constricted area, where their numbers would count for <b>little.</b> <b>The</b> battle at Artemisium had seen attempts to negate the Persian advantage in numbers, but ultimately the Allies may have realised that they needed an even more constricted channel in order to defeat the Persians. Therefore, by rowing into the Straits of Salamis to attack the Greeks, the Persians were playing into the Allies' hands. It seems probable that the Persians would not have attempted this unless the Persians were confident {{of the collapse of}} the Allied navy, and thus Themistocles's subterfuge appears to have {{played a key role in}} tipping the balance in the favor of the Greeks. Salamis was, for the Persians, an unnecessary battle and a strategic mistake.|$|E
5|$|With {{her right}} leg held {{straight}} and her left leg bent a <b>little</b> (<b>the</b> pratyalidha stance), Chhinnamasta stands in a fighting posture on the love-deity couple of Kamadeva (Kama)– a symbol of sexual lust– and his wife Rati, who are engaged in copulation with the latter usually on the top (viparita-rati sex position). Kamadeva is generally blue-complexioned, while Rati is white. Below the couple is a lotus with an inverted triangle, and in the background is a cremation ground. The Chhinnamasta Tantra describes the goddess sitting on the couple, rather than standing on them. Sometimes, Kamadeva-Rati is replaced by the divine couple of Krishna and Radha. The lotus beneath the couple is sometimes replaced by a cremation pyre. The coupling couple is sometimes omitted entirely. Sometimes Shiva– the goddess's consort– is depicted lying beneath Chhinnamasta, who is seated squatting on him and copulating with him. Dogs or jackals drinking the blood sometimes appear in the scene. Sometimes Chhinnamasta is depicted standing on a lotus, a grass patch, or the ground.|$|E
