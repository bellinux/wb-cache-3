25|$|On 17 July 2007, {{as part of}} the {{financing}} for the Tussauds deal, the freeholds of Alton Towers, Thorpe Park, Warwick Castle and Madame Tussauds were sold to private investor Nick Leslau and his investment firm Prestbury, with a subsequent <b>leaseback</b> agreement. Although the attraction sites are owned by Leslau, they are operated by Merlin based on a renewable 35-year lease.

Thunderbird alumni would have the option to purchase the campus from Laureate within two years or the school may repurchase their campus {{at the end of the}} twenty-year lease agreement.

50|$|The {{classification}} of large transactions, such as sale and <b>leasebacks</b> of property, {{may have a}} significant effect on the accounts and on measures of financial stability such as gearing. However, it is worth remembering that an improvement in financial gearing may be offset by a worsening of operational gearing and vice versa.|$|R
50|$|The {{system is}} well {{regarded}} {{as a model for}} other markets and credited with having allowed northern Colorado to adjust to short and long term shifts in water demand and supply. In 1962, irrigators owned 82% water allotments, down to 64% in 1982, and 55% in 1992, but still were able to use 71% of the water in 1992 through water <b>leasebacks.</b> Between 1970 and 1993 there were 2,698 transactions of one-third of the water allotments to another use or for use at a different location.|$|R
25|$|The {{welfare and}} <b>leaseback</b> {{programs}} got an abrupt ending as well. Eventually rulings {{were made on}} the tax issues making the sale-and-lease-back model less favorable. This {{as well as the}} bad media coverage of Brixtofte meant that investors lost faith in the administration. This caused the collapse of various plans that should have kept the scheme going, such as the sale of certain building sites. On top of that came increasing rent costs from the previous sales and eventually the municipality was forced to abandon the extraordinary welfare programs and dramatically raise its taxes. It went from being one of the cheapest {{to one of the most}} expensive municipalities in Denmark.|$|E
25|$|The {{market was}} forced to restructure. An ambitious plan {{entitled}} Reconstruction and Renewal was produced in 1995, with proposals for separating the ongoing Lloyd's from its past losses. Liability for all pre-1993 business was to be compulsorily transferred (by RITC) into a special vehicle named Equitas (which would require {{the approval of the}} UK's Department of Trade & Industry (DTI)) at a cost of around $21bn. Many Names faced large bills, but the plan also provided for a settlement of their disputes, a tax on recent profits, and the write-off of nearly $5bn of debts, skewed towards those with the most severe losses. The plan was debated at length, modified, and eventually strongly supported by the Association of Lloyd's Members (ALM) and most leaders of Names' action groups. Money was raised in many ways, including the sale and <b>leaseback</b> of the Lloyd's building, and a tax on future business. Individual offers were accepted by 95 per cent of Lloyd's names. The past liabilities of all Names were transferred to Equitas in September 1996.|$|E
25|$|Founder Steve Sullivan {{grew up in}} Los Gatos, California, and {{enrolled}} at the University of California, Berkeley in 1975, intending to major in rhetoric. He earned money as a busboy at Chez Panisse. While riding his bike through England during a summer trip to Europe he bought English Bread and Yeast Cookery, Elizabeth David's 1977 book on breadmaking and bread history. Excited by the book, and wanting to recreate the bread he had enjoyed in Paris, he began experimenting with baking for himself. In 1979, when ChezPanisse's then-supplier, the Cheese Board Collective, could {{not keep up with}} its demands, Sullivan became the restaurant's in-house breadmaker. However, his breadmaking and the restaurant's food preparation were both competing for the restaurant's limited physical space. In 1983 he left, with the restaurant's encouragement, to open his own company, Acme. Jeremiah Tower, then head chef, encouraged Sullivan to study breadmaking at Narsai David's bakery. He and wife Susan launched Acme with approximately $180,000 of seed capital, half funded by Doobie Brothers guitarist Patrick Simmons through a <b>leaseback</b> arrangement.|$|E
50|$|The {{community}} was incorporated in 1947. After World War II, {{a number of}} industrial developments, including Burns Harbor, were built to the west, and by the 1950s environmental organizations had begun to push for preservation of the area. The Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore was established in 1966. During the 1970s, there was a movement to purchase all the homes in Beverly Shores and incorporate the entire town into the National Lakeshore. This initiative did not succeed, but many local properties were acquired, {{especially those in the}} wetlands that constitute the southern portion. The acquisition process is ongoing. The owners of lots fronting on the beach were granted lifetime <b>leasebacks</b> with the proviso that the property would revert to the National Lakeshore; many of these houses have since been demolished.|$|R
50|$|Several types if {{stakeholders}} {{are recognized}} as potential participants in a water market, including agricultural users, industrial, and urban, {{as well as those}} who value in stream uses for recreation, habitat preservation, or other environmental benefits. Water rights holders—particularly agricultural users—can make water available for trade by employing water conservation technology, through permanent fallowing, seasonal fallowing, shifts in crop choice, or voluntary water conservation (for example, residential water conservation practices). Trades can then be long-term leases, permanent transfers, short-term leases, or a callable transfer, which is the ability of a city to lease water under specified drought conditions. There are other flexible trade tools used by urban areas, such as water <b>leasebacks,</b> wherein the municipality purchases the water right from agricultural users and then can lease it back to those users in non-drought years, as a way to ensure the urban water supply. Banking water is a related tool, wherein water is stored underground in non-drought years to be used in drought years, though this is not to be confused with water banks, which are brokering institutions. Water ranching is a method of accessing unclaimed water rights that are legally bound to land rights. While many areas have detached these two types of rights from one another, some still prohibit the severing of rights and thus continue to promote water ranching. In the event of water ranching, the groundwater removed from the property is often much greater than that which would be used for average agricultural use, which can be harmful to the ecosystems which rely on it. This practice also creates inefficiency in the dispersal of land and water access ownership, as non-agricultural parties, such as municipalities, may purchase a plot of land simply for its water.Water credits: The idea is to have a tradable certificate which notifies the quantity of water saved by an institution, organization or an individual this would help in maximum utilization of every available drop of water. It may be defined as a permit that allows the holder to trade the conserved water in the international market at their current market price.|$|R

2500|$|AI made {{a loss of}} £15million in {{the year}} to 30 June 1989, {{compared}} to £3.7million in the preceding year and £5.1million the year before that. [...] In early 1990, after refinancing efforts failed, the firm sought to improve its financial position through a sale and <b>leaseback</b> of the Cardington facilities, an attempted sale of its US operations to Lou Pearlman's Airship International and efforts to renegotiate the YEZ-2A contract from fixed-price to cost plus. However, share trading in AI's Isle of Man–based holding company was suspended in August 1990, and administrative receivers were appointed in September. About 7-% of its debts of £50 million were owed to Alan Bond.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Leaseback,</b> {{short for}} [...] "sale-and-leaseback," [...] is a {{financial}} transaction {{in which one}} sells an asset and leases it back for the long term; therefore, one continues {{to be able to}} use the asset but no longer owns it. The transaction is generally done for fixed assets, notably real estate, as well as for durable and capital goods such as airplanes and trains. The concept can also be applied by national governments to territorial assets; prior to the Falklands War, the government of the United Kingdom proposed a <b>leaseback</b> arrangement whereby the Falklands Islands would be transferred to Argentina, with a 99-year <b>leaseback</b> period, and a similar arrangement, also for 99 years, had been in place prior to the handover of Hong Kong to mainland China. <b>Leaseback</b> arrangements are usually employed because they confer financing, accounting or taxation benefits.|$|E

50|$|<b>Leaseback</b> of {{residential}} property has been popular in France {{for more than}} 30 years, and there are significant tax advantages. Under the scheme, the purchaser may use the property usually between 1 and 8 weeks per year (with a maximum of 6 months per year). The French government encourages the development of <b>leaseback</b> schemes in touristic areas to alleviate shortages in rental accommodation. The government rebates the local VAT (which is 19.6%), when the property is purchased off plan.|$|E

50|$|After {{purchasing}} an asset, {{the owner}} enters a long-term agreement {{by which the}} property is leased back to the seller at an agreed rate. One reason for a <b>leaseback</b> is to transfer ownership to a holding company while keeping proper track of the ongoing worth and profitability of the asset. Another reason is for the seller to raise money by offloading a valuable asset to a buyer who is presumably interested in making a long-term secured investment. <b>Leaseback</b> arrangements are common in the REIT industry.|$|E
50|$|<b>Leaseback</b> is {{very often}} used in {{commercial}} aviation to essentially take back the cash invested in assets. Airlines, for example, sell aircraft and engines to lessors, banks or other financial institutions who, in turn, lease the assets back to them. Tax deductions can also be realized by the airline since the asset is no longer owned but leased. Due to {{the high price of}} aircraft and engines, especially new, the cash from such a <b>leaseback</b> is used by airlines to improve their financial performance.|$|E
