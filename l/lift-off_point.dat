40|$|Data {{from field}} surveys and stream gages were {{analyzed}} from southern Lake Michigan {{in order to}} characterize the physical, biological, and chemical environments associated with river plumes. Five Lake Michigan tributaries were examined: Burns Ditch (IN); Trail Creek (IN); St. Joseph River (MI); Grand River (MI); and Muskegon River (MI). The field surveys indicate that specific conductance is a robust parameter for distinguishing river water from lake water for most of these southern watersheds. For most of the year, the plumes {{were found to be}} buoyant, {{with the exception of a}} brief period in late fall when air (and hence river) temperatures typically fall below the receiving lake water temperature. Field surveys indicate that the <b>lift-off</b> <b>point</b> for stronger buoyant plumes is consistently close to the river mouth, which agrees reasonably well with analytical predictions. For tributaries with very small flowrates, the plume <b>lift-off</b> <b>point</b> is upstream of the river outlet, causing an estuary-like environment in the river with buoyant river water atop colder lake water. The vertical extent of the surface plumes is found to be modest, less than 2 m thick at most in-lake locations. The horizontal extent of the plumes is also found to be relatively small, ranging from 0. 13 to 8. 5 km 2 in area, suggesting in-plume residence times of 0. 2 to 21. 8 hours. Application of recently-developed plume classification charts for wind-affected buoyant plumes indicates that most buoyant plumes are expected to be shore attached, offshore spreading, or diffuse offshore spreading. ...|$|E

3000|$|It can be {{seen that}} the dynamic {{displacement}} of the beam during vibration always varies in each time step. Thus, the contact surface between beam and subgrade can occurs gap or opposite, which corresponds with two conditions of the contact. The gap appearing between the beam and subgrade is not bonded while in the opposite case the beam is bonded to the elastic foundation. Two-condition contact between the beam and elastic foundation can be expressed as follows: u_i([...] ξ,t) > 0 —unbonded case and u_i([...] ξ,t) < 0 —bonded case, and especially u_i([...] ξ,t) = 0 is <b>lift-off</b> <b>point.</b> It is clear from Eq. (10), the dynamic displacement function u_i([...] ξ,t) is expressed by power-three polynomial in the local coordinate, and thus it is only able to have maximum three lift-off points on the length of the beam element solved from equation u_i([...] ξ,t) = 0. Based on two-condition contact and number of lift-off points, three beam element types which describe problem contact between the beam and tensionless elastic foundation are suggested in this paper as follows.|$|E
30|$|From these literatures, {{the problem}} of the dynamic {{analysis}} of beams subjected to a moving load on tensionless elastic foundation considering discontinuous contact by finite element method has limitation, and thus, this paper presents the contact element of beams to consider unbonded contact phenomenon between beam and foundation in this problem. Based on two contact conditions of the tensionless elastic foundation (bonded and unbonded to the tensionless elastic foundation) and number of <b>lift-off</b> <b>points,</b> three element types are suggested in this study including the full-bonded, full-unbonded and half-bonded element. This contact element uses to analyze dynamic responses of the beams under moving loads on tensionless elastic foundation considering discontinuous.|$|R
40|$|The {{voltages}} {{at which}} microelectromechanical actuators and sensors become unstable, known as pull-in and lift-off voltages, are critical parameters in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) design. The state-of-the-art MEMS simulators compute these parameters by simply sweeping the voltage, leading to either excessively large computational cost or to convergence failure near the pull-in or <b>lift-off</b> <b>points.</b> This paper proposes {{to simulate the}} behavior at pull-in and lift-off employing two continuation-based algorithms. The first algorithm appropriately adapts standard continuation methods, providing {{a complete set of}} static solutions. The second algorithm uses continuation to trace two kinds of curves and generates the sweep-up or sweep-down curves, which can provide more intuition for MEMS designers. The algorithms presented in this paper are robust and suitable for general-purpose industrial MEMS designs. Our algorithms have been implemented in a commercial MEMS/integrated circuits codesign tool, and their effectiveness is validated by comparisons against measurement data and the commercial finite-element/boundary-element (FEM/BEM) solver CoventorWare...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMany {{engineering}} {{materials and}} foundations such as soils demonstrate nonlinear and viscoelastic behaviour. Yet, {{it is challenging to}} develop static and dynamic models of systems that include these materials {{and are able}} to predict the behaviour over a wide range of loading conditions. This research is focused on a specific example: a pinned–pinned beam interacting with polyurethane foam foundation. Two cases, when the foundation can react in tension and compression as well as only in compression, are considered. The model developed here is capable of predicting the response to static as well as dynamic forces, whether concentrated or distributed. Galerkin’s method is used to derive modal amplitude equations. In the tensionless foundation case, the contact region changes with beam motion and the estimation of the co-ordinates of the <b>lift-off</b> <b>points</b> is embedded into the solution procedure. An efficient solution technique is proposed that is capable of handling cases where there are multiple contact and non-contact regions. Depending on the loading profiles a high number of modes may need {{to be included in the}} solution and to speed up computation time, a convolution method is used to evaluate the integral terms in the model. The adaptability of the solution scheme to complicated loading patterns is demonstrated via examples. The solution approach proposed is applicable to dynamic loadings as well and in these cases the automated treatment of complicated response patterns makes the convolution approach particularly attractive. The influence of various parameters on the static response is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the context}} of oceanographic {{research}} on northern estuaries in James Bay and Hudson Bay, and in relation with hydroelectric developments {{and their impact on}} the physical environment, two studies were undertaken. Both concern the importance of bottom topography, tidal motion and fresh water input on the estuarine processes in these areas. The first one, in Rupert Bay (south-eastern corner of James Bay), describes tidal and local wind effects on circulation and mixing patterns for summer conditions. An estimate of terms in the lateral momentum equation shows that the centrifugal acceleration, the Coriolis force and the baroclinic pressure gradient are the most important forces at a mid-bay cross section transect. The second study is concerned with the freshwater plume of Great Whale River (south-eastern Hudson Bay). CTD measurements were used to examine the <b>lift-off</b> <b>point</b> of the plume for under-ice and increasing discharge conditions. Comparison with existing models shows them to be inappropriate for under-ice conditions. Finally, the presence of supercooled water masses in the region of the study is reported...|$|E
40|$|Laser-induced {{fluorescence}} measurements {{have been}} performed in turbulent non-premixed flames close to the <b>lift-off</b> <b>point</b> and in laminar premixed acetylene flames. The spectrally analyzed fluorescence signal showed good correspondence to known spectra from glyoxal (C 2 H 2 O 2). Laser-induced fluorescence spectra from glyoxal vapor using the same excitation wavelength of 428 nm showed the same strongest lines as the signal from the flame. Glyoxal was visualized in two different modes; two-dimensional imaging and a spatial-spectral mode where spectra were obtained at different spatial positions in the flame simultaneously. For the premixed laminar rich flame it is shown that glyoxal is produced early in the flame, before the signals for C 2 and CH appear. For the turbulent non-premixed flames it is shown that glyoxal is produced in a layer on the fuel rich side of the flames. Here the fuel is premixed with ambient air. This layer is thin and has a high spatial resolution. The general trend was that the glyoxal signal appeared in regions with a lower temperature compared with the emission from C 2 and CH. The imaging of glyoxal in turbulent acetylene flames is a promising tool for achieving new insight into flame phenomena, as it gives very good structural information on the flame front. Tests so far do not indicate that the detected glyoxal {{is a result of}} photo-production. To our knowledge, this is the first detection of glyoxal in flames using laser-induced fluorescence...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{dynamics}} of an internal hydraulic jump in a river plume and associated suspended sediment dispersal. Field investigations were undertaken into the river plume generated by the Herbert River, Australia, following a moderate flood event induced by Cyclone Fritz in 2004. The forced plume experiences an abrupt transition from supercritical to subcritical via an internal hydraulic jump, as defined by a mode- 1 internal Froude number computed using the phase speeds from the Taylor- Goldstein equation. The hydraulic theory of a two-layer stratified flow was used to identify the plume shape and the mechanical energy loss within the jump. The hydraulic jump energy loss is primarily transferred to the buoyancy-driven potential energy, uplifting the river plume. Intense stratification decreases the bottom stress, damping the resuspension. Therefore, a separative nepheloid dispersal system occurs at the jump section. Both {{the upper and lower}} nepheloid flows are confined to the inner shelf, but have different dispersal behaviors and mechanisms. The upper nepheloid flow, which is primarily controlled by advection and settling, satisfies an exponential decay law of the total suspended sediment concentrations versus the offshore distance. The lower nepheloid flow dominated by deposition is detached seaward near the <b>lift-off</b> <b>point</b> of the river plume. A turbidity front associated with the jump may accumulate a large quantity of suspended sediments, enhancing sediment release from the river plume. These findings will promote in-depth understanding of both the cross-shelf sediment dispersal and muddy deposit on the shelf. No Full Tex...|$|E
30|$|Recently, the tensionless contact {{problem of}} an Euler–Bernoulli beam of finite length {{resting on a}} tensionless Pasternak is {{investigated}} by Andrea and Luca (2011). The unilateral nature of the beam–soil contact gives the problem a nonlinear feature and the contact region behavior was investigated under the action of a concentrated force located at midspan and a concentrated couple at either of the beam ends in three contact scenarios. Bhattiprolu et al. (2011) have studied the static and dynamic responses of a beam on a nonlinear tensionless viscoelastic foundation subjected to concentrated static and harmonic loads. The modal amplitude equations also involve co-ordinates of unknown “lift-off points” determined {{as a part of}} the solution for structural response through the constraints imposed on the solution derived by the Galerkin method using linear modal bases. Celep et al. (2011) have presented the static and dynamic responses of a completely free elastic beam resting on a two-parameter tensionless Pasternak foundation subjected to a concentrated force at the middle and a uniformly distributed load. Governing equations of the problem are obtained and solved by paying attention to the boundary conditions of the problem in the case of complete contact and lift-off condition of the beam in a two-parameter foundation and the nonlinear governing equation of the problem is evaluated numerically by adopting an iterative procedure. Ma et al. (2009) analyzes the static response of an infinite beam supported on a tensionless two-parameter Pasternak foundation with the transfer displacement function method and the <b>lift-off</b> <b>points</b> employed to determine the initially unknown lengths. Sapountzakis and Kampitsis (2010) used the boundary element method for the nonlinear dynamic behavior of beam supported on tensionless Winkler foundation. Zhang and Murphy (2012) have studied a general formulation developed for the contact behavior of a finite circular plate with a tensionless elastic foundation. The gap distance between the plate and elastic foundation incorporated as an important parameter is reduced to zero when the plate radius becomes large enough and the contact area varies with the plate radius, boundary conditions and gap distance. Contact problem for an elastic layer on an elastic half plane loaded by means of three rigid flat punches is studied by Ozsahin and Taskiner (2013). In this study, the frictionless contact problem for an elastic layer resting on an elastic half plane is solved by the theory of elasticity and integral transformation technique, and different parameters are researched for various dimensionless quantities for both continuous and discontinuous contact cases. Konstantinos and Dimitrios (2013) have presented the buckling of axially compressed beams resting on elastic foundation considering discontinuous (unbonded) contact between beam and subgrade. A two-region contact/non-contact configuration is revealed using Galerkin’s method as the only possible post-buckling deformation for both pinned–pinned and fixed–fixed boundary conditions.|$|R
40|$|Transient {{eddy current}} {{inspection}} is being developed for detection of flaws located at depth in airplane wing structures. The input transient signal induces eddy currents, which interact with the flaws in a conducting structure to produce an output signal that provides information about the flaw. The output signal may depend strongly {{on a number of}} probe design parameters in addition to probe lift-off from the sample surface. The present work is aimed at investigating the effect of some of these parameters on the output signal by using three-dimensional finite element modeling employing the COMSOL Multiphysics commercial package. The model incorporates a reflection-type probe that consists of a driver coil, a pickup coil and a ferrite core and is placed on a multilayer aluminum structure with a variable lift-off. The parameters such as number of turns of the driver, length of the ferrite core and permeability of the core were varied to study the variation in current distribution and penetration depth within the sample. The modeled results were validated against experimental observations taken in the laboratory by using a probe configuration of identical geometry and electrical parameters. A TecScan System was employed to record and analyze the data. The variation of pickup voltage with lift-off revealed the existence of a <b>lift-off</b> intersection <b>point</b> for flat plates in agreement with experiment. The variations of pickup voltage with number of turns of the driver, length of the core, and permeability of the core are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{continuous}} casting process is controlled automatically because various sensors and control unitsare {{connected to the}} mold and lower tundish roll. The solidification point in the process has a major factor onthe quality of products, but the point has been predicted depending on the inaccurate calculated results from acomputer simulation until now. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} paper is to develop the EMAT sensors for themeasurement of the solidification point made by a through transmission technique based on the relationshipbetween ultrasonic speed and measured temperature. Design/methodology/approach: The EMAT sensor is composed of an Elongated Spiral (ES) forming an eddycurrent and a permanent magnetic core generating a static magnetic field. ES coils of the sensor to measure 0. 08 mm, 0. 2 mm and 0. 45 mm as solidification points were employed respectively. Probes for receiving andtransmitting which included 4 permanent magnets measuring 5 × 5 × 10 mm, were placed together in one unit. Each coil was used to magnetic cores measuring 0. 08 mm and 0. 45 mm wound around it forty three times. TheAI 75 × 75 mm and 75 × 100 mm simulators to identify whether the solidification point can be detected using anEMAT sensor, were machined with 2 mm, 4 mm, 8 mm, 16 mm and 32 mm holes in diameter respectively. Findings: The electromagnetic interaction decreases in a high sphere of <b>lift-off.</b> Solidification <b>point</b> in a{{continuous casting}} processing could be detected through a series of tests with the use of a fabricated probe andthe amplitude extent of ultrasonic wave decreases as the hole diameter of the simulators increases, Furthermore,the sensor developed is useful for measuring things such as lift-off.

40|$|The dynamic {{steady-state}} {{response of}} a viscoelastic cylinder cover subjected to circumferentially moving constant point and distributed loads is studied using a 1 D Pasternak-type foundation model. The cover material is modeled {{according to the}} generalized Maxwell model as an incompressible frequency-dependent viscoelastic material spanning a wide relaxation spectrum. The vibration response of the cover for a moving twin point load is obtained using a modal expansion approach. On {{the basis of the}} solution, additional moving load cases are derived. In the case of a single moving point load, representing a load resultant due to rolling contact, numerical calculations show that regardless of the viscoelastic damping in the model, the critical load speed for the system can be well estimated by a resonance condition. In the vicinity of the critical speed, an incipient traveling wave arises behind the moving load. The viscoelastic cover stiffens for increasing excitation frequencies, thus, the cover response dividesinto two separate mode branches, of which the low-mode branch is dominant. A method to suppress the traveling wave vibrations in the cover at supercritical speeds using a moving twin point load, adjusted according to a dominant resonating mode, is presented. Using a distributed moving load, it is shown that depending on the wavelength, a traveling wave generated at {{the leading edge of the}} load may be reinforced at the trailing edge, the <b>lift-off</b> <b>point,</b> of the load. The developed model offers a fast and reliable way for practitioners to estimate the critical speeds of rolling contact machines with viscoelastic covers. Peer reviewe...|$|E
30|$|The {{most popular}} {{features}} {{to be used}} in order to minimize the effects of lift-off is called <b>lift-off</b> <b>point</b> of intersection (LOI), which is a point at which PEC signals intersect when only lift-off distance varies. Therefore, LOI is inherently immune to lift-off variations, which makes a LOI point one of desirable features to remove lift-off effect for PEC evaluation. LOI phenomenon was originally observed in experiments and proposed to avoid false indication due to lift-off effect when material loss in a two-layer assembly was evaluated by PEC technique [65], [66]. It is reported that the signals of LOI points have been successfully adopted to measure the thickness of a plate [67] and quantify defects and their locations in a layered sample [68]. To enable the interpretation of LOI signals, the characteristics of LOI signals in terms of time and amplitude were revealed under a wide variety of conditions. The results demonstrate that LOI signals including both the time and amplitude follow a unique curve against thickness and conductivity [69]. At the early stage, LOI phenomenon could only exist when a PEC probe using a coil as the receiver is placed above a nonferrous sample. Tian, et al [70] obtained LOI points by doing the derivative of the output of a Hall-based probe, and Li [71] extended the method to a PEC probe in which a solid-state magnetic field sensor could be placed at arbitrary positions. Further, Lefebvre and Mandache [72] recorded LOI phenomenon by covering a conductive but nonferrous layer on a ferromagnetic substrate. Also, Mandache and Lefebvre [73] made an attempt to disclose the physics of the LOI phenomenon. It is found that the LOI phenomenon is a general characteristic of the eddy currents, not only to transient eddy currents. Kral, et al [74] presented a linear transformer model to investigate the origin of LOI phenomenon, and obtained LOI points from the time derivatives of the output of a GMR-based probe. Interestingly, a LOI point is recently observed in the spectral PEC signals [67].|$|E
40|$|Steady, inviscid, {{supersonic}} flow past conical wings is studied {{within the context}} of irrotational, nonlinear theory. An efficient numerical method is developed to calculate cones of arbitrary section at incidence. The method is fully conservative and implements a body conforming mesh generator. The conical potential is assumed to have its best linear variation inside each cell; a secondary interlocking cell system is used to establish the flux balance required to conserve mass. In regions of supersonic cross flow, the discretization scheme is desymmetrized by adding the appropriate artificial viscosity in conservation form. The algorithm is nearly an order of magnitude faster than present Euler methods. It predicts known results as long as the flow Mach numbers normal to the shock waves are near 1; qualitative features, such as nodal <b>point</b> <b>lift-off,</b> are also predicted correctly. Results for circular and thin elliptic cones are shown to compare very well with calculations using Euler equations. This algorithm is then implemented in the design of conical wings to be free from shock waves terminating embedded supersonic zones adjacent to the body. This is accomplished by generating a smooth cross-flow sonic surface by using a fictitious gas law that makes the governing equation elliptic inside the cross-flow sonic surface. The shape of the wing required to provide this shock-free flow, if such a flow is consistent with the sonic surface data, is found by solving the Cauchy problem inside the sonic surface using the data on this surface and, of course, the correct gas law. This design procedure is then demonstrated using the simple case of a circular cone at angle of attack...|$|R
