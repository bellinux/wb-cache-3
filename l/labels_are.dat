5|$|It {{also led}} to the birth and {{diffusion}} of small independent record labels, often an extension of record shops and independent recording studios, which sometimes produced both punk and metal releases. Indie <b>labels</b> <b>are</b> considered important to the movement's evolution, because they removed the intrusion of corporate business which had hindered rock music in the late 1970s, giving local bands the chance to experiment with more extreme forms of music.|$|E
5|$|In {{many of the}} works, {{including}} the original series, Warhol drastically simplified the gold medallion that appears on Campbell's Soup cans by replacing the paired allegorical figures with a flat yellow disk. In most variations, the only hint of three-dimensionality came from the shading on the tin lid. Otherwise the image was flat. The works with torn <b>labels</b> <b>are</b> perceived as metaphors {{of life in the}} sense that even packaged food must meet its end. They are often described as expressionistic.|$|E
5|$|The {{permutations}} of B1 are {{the number}} of ways to relabel the 9 digits, 9! = 362880. Counting the permutations for B2 is more complicated, because the choices for B2 depend on the values in B1. (This is a visual representation of the expression given above.) The conditional calculation needs a branch (sub-calculation) for each alternative. Fortunately, there are just 4 cases for the top B2 triplet (r21): it contains either 0, 1, 2, or 3 of the digits from the B1 middle row triplet(r12). Once this B2 top row choice is made, {{the rest of the}} B2 combinations are fixed. The Band1 row triplet <b>labels</b> <b>are</b> shown on the right.|$|E

40|$|Glutamine {{synthetase}} was localized in nodules, roots, stems, {{and leaves}} of {{red kidney bean}} (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) by immunocytochemistry. Affinity purified antibodies reactive with glutamine synthetase were prepared using purified nodule-enhanced glutamine synthetase. Immunogold <b>labeling</b> <b>was</b> observed in the cell cytoplasm in each plant organ. In nodules, the <b>labeling</b> <b>was</b> more intense in the infected cells than in the uninfected cells. No <b>labeling</b> <b>was</b> observed in nodule bacteroids, peribacteroid spaces, or in peribacteroid membranes, while previous reports of glutamine synthetase immunolabeling of legume nodules showed labeling in the bacteroid fraction. Significant <b>labeling</b> <b>was</b> observed in nodule proplastids which contained starch granules. Substantial <b>labeling</b> <b>was</b> also observed in leaf chloroplasts. No <b>labeling</b> <b>was</b> observed in other organelles including mitochondria, peroxisomes, and endoplasmic reticulum. Preimmune IgGs did not bind to any structure in the tissues examined...|$|R
5|$|The {{basic unit}} of Maya hieroglyphic text is the glyph block, which transcribes {{a word or}} phrase. The block is {{composed}} {{of one or more}} individual glyphs attached to each other to form the glyph block, with individual glyph blocks generally being separated by a space. Glyph blocks are usually arranged in a grid pattern. For ease of reference, epigraphers refer to glyph blocks from left to right alphabetically, and top to bottom numerically. Thus, any glyph block in a piece of text can be identified: C4 would be third block counting from the left, and the fourth block counting downwards. If a monument or artefact has more than one inscription, column <b>labels</b> <b>are</b> not repeated, rather they continue in the alphabetic series; if there are more than 26 columns, the labelling continues as A', B', etc. Numeric row labels restart from 1 for each discrete unit of text.|$|E
