40|$|Abstract. The {{elemental}} and phase compositions of cornstalk ash {{are largely}} {{different from that}} of <b>lean</b> <b>coal</b> ash. In comparison with pure <b>lean</b> <b>coal,</b> co-firing of cornstalk and <b>lean</b> <b>coal</b> may result in serious corrosion to the heating surface of superheater. This paper presents a composition comparison between the two ashes by means of Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) analysis and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis. A number of experiments were carried out in a tubular furnace to investigate the ash corrosion characteristics. Measured corrosion characteristic curves show the agreement of parabolic rule, and the corrosion is mainly effected by ash compositions and temperature. It was also found that alkali-chloride, alkali metal sulphide in ash and HCl in flue gas significantly aggravate the corrosion. The corrosion speed increases as the temperature increase, and becomes significantly high when the temperature is above 550 ℃...|$|R

Technical measures taken in the burners {{as well as the}} firing systems are described and results are compared with those obtained in bituminous <b>coal</b> and <b>lean</b> <b>coal.</b> The HBC burner was capable of abating NOx emission by up to 54 % and ensuring the boiler to operate at a rate as low as 45 % of MCR without resorting to supporting fuel oil, with an improvement in shut-down ratio by 20 ~ 35 %. Other merits of HBC burners like avoiding slagging and increasing combustion efficiency are also shown. It is a technology of multifunction and of great promise...|$|R
40|$|Taking natural coal as a {{seed bank}} of {{bacterial}} strains able to degrade lignin that is with molecular structure similar to coal components, we isolated 393 and 483 bacterial strains from a meager <b>lean</b> <b>coal</b> sample from Hancheng coalbed and a brown coal sample from Bayannaoer coalbed, respectively by using different media. Statistical {{analysis showed that}} isolates were significantly more site-specific than medium-specific. Of the 876 strains belonging to 27 genera in Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria, 612 were positive for lignin degradation function, including 218 strains belonging to 35 species in Hancheng and 394 strains belonging to 19 species in Zhongqi. Among them, the dominant lignin-degrading strains were Thauera (Hancheng), Arthrobacter (Zhongqi) and Rhizobium (both). The genes encoding the laccases- or laccase-like multicopper oxidases, key enzymes in lignin production and degradation, were detected in three genera including Massilia for the first time, which was in high expression by real time PCR (qRT-PCR) detection, confirming coal as a good seed bank...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{studied the}} deep-seat coal seam in Wangfenggang mine Huainan area, and {{analyzed}} {{the characteristics of}} coal petrology and coal type distribution, then discussed the influences of regional geothermal history and tectonic subsidence history on regional coal metamorphism process.

The metamorphism developing tend is same with coal seam structural shape. It presents that the tectonic stress on hydrostatic pressure state can affect coal metamorphism process. It was predicted that the metamorphic type of Wangfenggang minefield is superposition from the effect of energy transformation from tectonic stress on hydrostatic pressure state and katogenic metamorphism, which is long term regional extrusion has promoted and controlled coal metamorphism. The study on coal metamorphism on deep seated seam can be very important on coking coal's development in China and also contribute to present metamorphism theory...|$|R
40|$|The coal-based carbon counter {{electrodes}} (CEs) with low-cost and high-performance {{were prepared}} from different coal powders such as gas coal, coking <b>coal</b> and <b>lean</b> <b>coal,</b> {{and they were}} used to substitute both conductive glass substrate and catalyst layer. The effects of impregnation and surface modification of the coal-based carbon CEs on their structure and photovoltaic performance were investigated. XRD, SEM and electrochemical impedance spectroscope were used to character the structure and performance of coal based carbon CEs. Results show that the coal based carbon CE after impregnated is the integrative CE with porous top surface and dense bottom. The solar cell with coal based carbon CE with surface modified demonstrates high photovoltaic performance with open circuit photo-voltage (V oc) of 0. 79 V, short circuit photocurrent density (J sc) of 13. 48 mA/cm 2, fill factor (FF) of 0. 67, and solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) of 7. 16 %, which is 30 % higher than that of the cell with graphite electrode, and comparable to that of the cell with Pt electrode.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a process to}} convert coal and natural gas to a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons, which {{is intended to be}} sold as a feedstock for a refinery. Given that the region has a large amount of coal production and sits atop the Marcellus shale with its expanding natural gas production, as well as the proximity to refineries in Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania is a natural location for such a venture. 2600 tons per day of coal and 66 million standard cubic feet per day of natural gas are converted to syngas in separate, parallel process trains. The hydrogen rich natural gas syngas is mixed with the hydrogen <b>lean</b> <b>coal</b> syngas to give the desired syngas composition. Fischer-Tropsch chemistry is used to convert syngas with a 2 to 1 H 2 :CO molar ratio to a distribution of alkanes. The alkanes are separated to give 15, 500 barrels per day of liquid product. The total capital investment of the project was estimated to be $ 1, 308 million. Using the EIA baseline projection for the price of oil and a 15 % discount rate, the project is expected to have a net present value of -$ 258 million, with an internal rate of return of 11 %.

40|$|Five coal-containing dusts from {{materials}} of the Ruhr coal mining area {{were applied to}} female Wistar rats by intratracheal instillation of a suspension of 6 mg dust 10 or 20 times weekly. The content of SiO 2 in two dusts from milled <b>coal</b> (<b>lean</b> <b>coal</b> and lower rich coal) was not detectable (means < 0. 1 %) and ash content was low (5 and 6 %). The other coal-containing dusts (fine fractions of dusts collected from the air in mines) contained more SiO 2 (1. 3 %, 9 %, 16. 7 %) and more ash (~ 40 %, ~ 60 %, 86 %). The median metric diameters were between 1. 8 and 4. 0 nm and the density between 1. 4 (milled coal) and 2. 4 g/mL (stone dust). The tumor response was dose-dependent. After treatment with the lower dose, malignant and/or benign lung tumors were found in 57 - 72 % {{with the exception of}} 34 % of the stone dust with 86 % ash and 16. 7 % quartz. The results show that relatively coarse coal dusts with a lung burden of about 40 mg induced unexpectedly high lung tumor rates wiht the sensitive intratracheal model. Taking earlier results into consideration, the volume of low toxic dusts seems to be more important for the tumor repsonse than particle size. The different quartz contents of the coal-containing dusts tested did not detectably influence the carcinogenicity...|$|R

Reaction of CuO and Fe 2 O 3 mixed oxygen carrier (OC) with a Chinese <b>lean</b> <b>coal</b> was experimentally investigated by thermogravimetric (TGA) coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and further thermodynamically simulated using HSC software. TGA-FTIR experiments {{indicated that the}} reaction of LPS with CuO and Fe 2 O 3 mixed OC was more advantageous than that of LPS with CuO or Fe 2 O 3 separately. And especially at the later reaction stage, high concentration of CO 2 and H 2 O obtained from the reaction of LPS with CuO promoted LPS gasification and its further reaction with Fe 2 O 3, and the maximum weight loss rate for the reaction of LPS with Fe 2 O 3 was 0. 326 wt%/min, far close to that of LPS with CuO at the initial reaction stage. Furthermore, thermodynamic simulation of the reaction of LPS with CuO and Fe 2 O 3 mixed OC revealed that, in terms of LPS coal transformation, CO 2 and H 2 O were the dominant products. Meanwhile, during the reaction of LPS with CuO and Fe 2 O 3 mixed OC, CuO was mainly reduced to Cu, but besides Fe 3 O 4, deep reduction of Fe 2 O 3 into FeO occurred. Finally, CuO was preferred to react with FeS 2 inherent in LPS to form Cu 2 S but the reduced Fe 2 O 3 was easily reacted with SiO 2 in LPS to form FeSiO 3...|$|R

The structures of raw coal and super pure coal {{were characterized by}} thermogravimetry and Fu Liye infrared spectrum. The {{results showed that the}} heat extraction rate of super pure coal was decreased with the increasing of coalification degree. The ash of raw coal which were silicate and alumina can be concentrated by heat extraction technology into coal residue and the mixtures of various structure were mainly composed of aromatic hydrocarbons also can be extracted effectively. With the production capacity of China's iron and steel industry continues to expand, the amount of coke continued to rise. Coking process is current still in coking coal (coking coal, fat coal, fat gas coal, gas coal, 1 / 3 coking <b>coal,</b> <b>lean</b> <b>coal,</b> etc.). Although coking coal is the full range in our country, it is a relatively small species, especially the quality of coking coal is scarce varieties. It is mainly distributed in the Permian and Carboniferous, Permian coal-bearing strata in Southern China. In the international market coking coal supply is tight, and the foreign monopoly on coking coal trend is clearly. Experiment 1. 1 Coal samples In the experiments Coal samples were used of the Hebei Xingtai well-off village 1 / 3 coking coal (XKZ), Ningxia state water bridge (YSQ) and Inner Mongolia Wuhai coal (WH), Shanxi Liulin coal (LL) and Sima of Shanxi coal (SM). According to the national standard GB 474 - 1996 for sample preparation, the coal samples were crushed and divided less than 100 µm in 150 min at 100 ℃ in drying and vacuum conditions.

40|$|China {{has a huge}} {{demand for}} energy. Under the present energy {{structure}} of rich <b>coal,</b> <b>lean</b> oil, less gas, limited and low-rising rate renewable energy, discussion focus {{is now on the}} high-efficient mining of coal as well as its clean-and-low-carbon use. In view of this, based on an analysis of the problems in the coal chemical industry and the present coal utilization ways such as Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC), this paper proposes that underground coal gasification (UCG) technology is a realistic choice. By virtue of its advantages in many aspects such as safety & environment, integrated use of superior resources, economic feasibility, etc. this technology can serve as the front-end support and guarantee for coal chemical industry and IGCC. Under the present situation, the following proposals were presented to promote the development of this technology. First, R&D of technical products should be strengthened, a comprehensive feasibility study assessment system should be established, and the relevant criteria in the industry should be formulated. Second, precise market positioning of UCG products should be made with much concern on the integrated economic indicators of each product's complete flow scheme, following the principle of “Technical Feasibility First, Economic Optimization Followed”. Third, a perfect operation and management pattern should be established with strict control over high-efficient, environmentally-friendly, safe, harmonious & compact objectives in the whole industry chain. In conclusion, to realize the large-scale UCG commercial production will strongly promote the optimization and innovation of fossil fuels supply-side economics in China...|$|R
40|$|The coal-bearing Upper Carboniferous Barachois Group {{of western}} Newfoundland {{consists}} of the youngest known rocks in the St. George's Bay Lowlands. These lowlands {{are part of the}} Bay St. George Subbasin, which, in turn, is part of a network of Carboniferous depositional areas in eastern Canada. A detailed sedimentological study of the Barachois Group was undertaken as part of a more general study (involving geology and geophysics) to assess the fossil-fuel potential of the western Newfoundland Carboniferous subbasins. [...] Cores and exposures of the Barachois Group in the St. George's Bay Lowlands define a lower coarse unit and an upper fine unit. The coarse unit consists of alternating red-brown mudstone-dominated units and grey sandstone and conglomerate-dominated units. The fine unit consists of thick grey or red-brown mudstone-dominated units with interspersed sandstone units. Eleven facies (A to K) are recognized in the two units. The facies are organized into three facies associations and eight subassociations. Facies association I includes fluvial channel sandstones and conglomerates found in outcrops and the BSG£ 1 core (subassociation IA) and channel and minor sheetflood deposits found in the FB 2 - 76 core (subassociation IB). Facies association II comprises sandstones and mudstones deposited in proximal crevasse channel and levee environments (subassociation IIA), in undifferentiated crevasse splay, levee, and floodplain environments (subassociation IIB), and by progradation of crevasse splay, levee, and delta environments (subassociation IIC). Facies association III includes mudstone-dominated subassociations which represent the deposits of floodplain lakes (subassociation IIIA), poorly-drained swamps (subassociation IIIB), and well-drained swamps (subassociation IIIC). [...] Sandstones of the Barachois Group are classified predominantly as arkose and subarkose, with up to 65 % feldspar. The sandstones include a variety of authigenic minerals such as kaolinitie, chlorite, illite, calcite, and silica. Sandstone mineralogy does not identify any distinctive provenance. Potential sources of the arkoses could have included several of the presently exposed igneous intrusive complexes in the Long Range Mountains located southeast, east, and north of the study area. [...] X-ray diffraction of the < 2 micrometer fraction shows that mudstones contain illite, chlorite, kaolinite and mixed-layer clay minerals. Illite predominates in non-grey mudstone; chlorite is the most abundant clay mineral in grey mudstones. Variations in clay mineralogy are due to a combination of initial detrital mineralogy and relative stability of clay minerals through a variety of depositional and diagenetic environments. [...] Kerogen types in the Barachois Group are dominated by woody (type III) kerogen with lesser amounts of amorphous and herbaceous types. Thermal maturation indices and kerogen type indicate that mudstones have a fair gas potential, but potential reservoir rocks exhibit poor to fair porosity. Oil shales are <b>lean</b> and <b>coals</b> exhibit considerable variation both between and within seams in terms of ash and sulfur contents.
