The pact formalized relations both between the two major leagues and {{between them and the}} National Association of Professional Base Ball Leagues, representing most of the country's minor professional leagues. The World Series, pitting the two major <b>league</b> champions against each other, was inaugurated that fall, albeit without express major <b>league</b> sanction: The Boston Americans of the American <b>League</b> defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National <b>League.</b> The next year, the series was not held, as the National <b>League</b> champion New York Giants, under manager John McGraw, refused to recognize the major <b>league</b> status of the American <b>League</b> and its champion. In 1905, the Giants were National <b>League</b> champions again and team management relented, leading to the establishment of the World Series as the major leagues' annual championship event.|$|E

5|$|An {{exception}} to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions <b>League</b> the year before, but did not finish in a Champions <b>League</b> qualification place in the Premier <b>League</b> that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions <b>League,</b> giving England five qualifiers. UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic <b>league</b> placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions <b>League,</b> this meant that if the Champions <b>League</b> winner finished outside the top four in its domestic <b>league,</b> it would qualify {{at the expense of}} the fourth-placed team in the <b>league.</b> At that time, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions <b>League.</b> This occurred in 2012, when Chelsea – who had won the Champions <b>League</b> that summer, but finished sixth in the <b>league</b> – qualified for the Champions <b>League</b> in place of Tottenham Hotspur, who went into the Europa <b>League.</b>|$|E
