Aboveground and belowground {{processes}} in plants are intimately linked because the resources that must be divided among growth, maintenance, and development of essential structures are finite. To determine how aboveground insect herbivory affects root-system size, morphology, interactions with soil biota, and temporal patterns {{in the development of}} root systems, we grew the legume <b>Lespedeza</b> <b>capitata</b> in sunken pots in a restored prairie in south-central Kansas. The plants were manipulated in a factorial experiment that involved reduction of natural herbivory with insecticide and age of plant at harvest (2, 4, or 6 months). Herbivory reduced the aboveground sizes of plants throughout the growing season but did not affect their belowground size or root-system branching ratio. Further, the failure of aboveground insect herbivory to affect density of nitrogen-fixing nodules on L. capitata roots suggests that plants did not shift allocation of carbon to compensate for naturally occ! urring levels of folivory. We suggest that conservation of root-system structure or low rates of change in root-system structure in response to aboveground insect herbivory may be an adaptive strategy in environments with scarce soil resources, for example near species' xeric range limits.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of bioactive molecules from botanical sources is an expanding field, preferentially oriented to plants having {{a tradition of}} use in medicine and providing high yields and availability. Temperate forage legumes are Fabaceae species that include worldwide-important crops. These plants possess therapeutic virtues {{that have been used}} in veterinary and folk medicine, but have also attracted the interest of official medicine. We have examined here Medicago sativa (alfalfa), Trifolium pratense and T. repens (clovers), Melilotus albus and M. officinalis (sweet clovers), Lotus corniculatus (birdsfoot trefoil), Onobrychis viciifolia (sainfoin), <b>Lespedeza</b> <b>capitata</b> (roundhead lespedeza), and Galega officinalis (goat's rue). The phytochemical complexes of these species contain secondary metabolites whose pharmacological potentials deserve investigation. Major classes of compounds include alkaloids and amines, cyanogenic glycosides, flavonoids, coumarins, condensed tannins, and saponins. Some of these phytochemicals have been related to anti-hypercholesterolemia, antidiabetic, anti-menopause, anti-inflammatory, antiedema, anthelmintic, and kidney protective effects. Two widely-prescribed drugs have been developed starting from temperate forage legumes, namely the antithrombotic warfarin, inspired from sweet clover's coumarin, and the antidiabetic metformin, a derivative of sainfoin's guanidine.

Fabaceae are major agricultural crops and potential sources of bioactive compounds with possible applications in human health and skin care. This study concerns the biological activities of the legume crops Melilotus officinalis (L.) Pall. and <b>Lespedeza</b> <b>capitata</b> Michx. for their potential use in skin care applications. The effects of plant ethanolic extracts at doses ranging from 0. 25 to 50 Î¼g/mL (from 1 to 5000 Î¼g/mL in cell viability assays) were evaluated using in vitro tests on HaCaT human keratinocytes, 46 BR. 1 N fibroblasts, and adipocyte cell cultures, and on matrix-degrading enzymes. MTT assay revealed weak effects on cell viability (IC 50 > 1000 Î¼g/mL) and significant increase of fibroblast growth rate with both extracts. Similar induction of cell motility by the two extracts was observed on keratinocytes, while on fibroblasts M. officinalis induced a stronger effect with respect to L. capitata. Cell-free enzymatic assays showed stronger collagenase inhibition by L. capitata, while an ELISA assay revealed more efficient stimulation of fibroblast collagen production by M. officinalis. Oil-Red-O adipocyte staining showed more pronounced lipolytic effect of M. officinalis with respect to L. capitata. Both extracts showed the ability of stimulating skin cells in order to promote tissue regeneration, prevent skin aging, and reduce fat deposition. In most cases, different patterns of activation/inhibition were observed. Data indicate that these legume crops could be profitably exploited in skin care applications, possibly in combined formulations for the development of antiaging and anticellulite products...|$|E

Because prairies are often nitrogen (N) limited, prairie legumes can have significant {{impacts on the}} nitrogen (N) dynamics of these communities because {{of their ability to}} add fixed N to their surroundings through symbiotic biological N 2 -fixation and their N-rich tissues that can stimulate net nitrogen mineralization. Predicted increases in temperature have the potential to alter legume traits and functioning, which can feedback to affect ecosystem dynamics. The goal of this dissertation was to examine the effect of elevated temperature on the growth, phenology, and N nutrition of four prairie legumes: Amorpha canescens, Dalea purpurea, <b>Lespedeza</b> <b>capitata,</b> and Lupinus perennis, using both a growth chamber experiment and a manipulative field warming experiment. In the growth chamber experiment, seedlings of Lespedeza exhibited higher biomass and shoot N content at 28 Â°C than 25 Â°C, while Lupinus seedlings displayed decreased nodulation and lower shoot N concentration at the higher temperature. In the field warming study, Dalea and Lupinus displayed higher biomass under warming and all species exhibited lower shoot N concentrations under warming. Neither N 2 -fixation nor net N mineralization were affected by warming. Warming accelerated flowering for several species, including Amorpha and Dalea, and accelerated spring green-up, as evidenced by higher normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values in warmed communities in May. These results indicate that prairie legumes are responsive to increases in temperature in a species-specific manner and that warming may alter N-cycling by changing legume abundance and tissue N chemistry. Additionally, significant interannual variation in many variables and in their responses to warming emphasizes the need for long term studies to better understand and predict potential consequences of elevated temperature on plants and their ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Resource {{abundance}} and plant diversity are two predominant factors hypothesized {{to influence the}} amount of damage plants receive from natural enemies. Many impacts of these environmental variables on plant damage are likely indirect and result because both resource availability and diversity can influence plant traits associated with attractiveness to herbivores or susceptibility to pathogens. We used a long-term, manipulative field experiment to investigate how carbon dioxide (CO 2) enrichment, nitrogen (N) fertilization, and plant community diversity affect plant traits {{and the amount of}} herbivore and pathogen damage experienced by the common prairie legume <b>Lespedeza</b> <b>capitata.</b> We detected little evidence that CO 2 or N affected plant traits; however, plants growing in high-diversity treatments (polycultures) were taller, were less pubescent, and produced thinner leaves (higher specific leaf area). Interestingly, we also detected little evidence that CO 2 or N affect damage. Plants growing in polycultures compared to monocultures, however, experienced a fivefold increase in damage from generalist herbivores, 64 % less damage from specialist herbivores, and 91 % less damage from pathogens. Moreover, within diversity treatments, damage by generalist herbivores was negatively correlated with pubescence and often was positively correlated with plant height, while damage by specialist herbivores typically was positively correlated with pubescence and negatively associated with height. These patterns are consistent with changes in plant traits driving differences in herbivory between diversity treatments. In contrast, changes in measured plant traits did not explain the difference in disease incidence between monocultures and polycultures. In summary, our data provide little evidence that CO 2 or N supply alter damage from natural enemies. By contrast, plants grown in monocultures experienced greater specialist herbivore and pathogen damage but less generalist herbivore damage than plants grown in diverse communities. Part of this diversity effect was mediated by changes in plant traits, many of which likely are plastic responses to diversity treatments, but some of which {{may be the result of}} evolutionary changes in response to these long-term experimental manipulations...|$|E

Plant impacts on nutrient use profiles among rhizosphere microbes are poorly understood. We {{examined the effects}} of plant host and plant species richness on nutrient use profiles of Streptomyces isolated from the rhizosphere of the prairie plants Andropogon gerardii (Ag) and <b>Lespedeza</b> <b>capitata</b> (Lc) growing in communities of 1 (monoculture) or 16 (polyculture) plant species. Growth on 95 carbon sources was assessed over time. Mean niche width and mean growth were significantly greater for isolates from polyculture vs. monoculture plots, and for Streptomyces from Lc vs. Ag. Isolates from high-carbon (polyculture) or high-nitrogen (Lc) soils had larger niche widths than isolates from low-C (monocultures) or low-N (Ag) soils. Isolates from polycultures were significantly more niche (nutrient) differentiated than isolates from monocultures. We also characterized antagonistic phenotypes and nutrient use among sympatric Streptomyces and Fusarium. Streptomyces from monocultures were more antagonistic against sympatric Fusarium populations than isolates from polycultures. In contrast, Fusarium isolates from polycultures were more inhibitory against sympatric Streptomyces than isolates from monocultures. Fusarium isolates from monocultures had greater niche overlap with Streptomyces than those from polycultures, suggesting greater potential for Fusarium to compete with Streptomyces in monoculture plant communities. In contrast, Streptomyces from polycultures had greater niche overlap with sympatric Fusarium than those from monocultures, suggesting that Fusarium experience greater competition from Streptomyces in polyculture than monoculture. These patterns are consistent with selection for Fusarium-antagonistic Streptomyces populations in the presence of strong Fusarium competition in monocultures, and selection for Streptomyces-inhibitory Fusarium populations in the presence of Streptomyces resource competition in polycultures. Finally, we found evidence for local adaptation between Fusarium and Streptomyces populations as evidenced by the presence of significantly greater inhibition among sympatric than allopatric populations in prairie soil. Additionally, for both taxa, there was a significant positive correlation between the strength of inhibition against each taxon and the intensity of resource competition from that taxon, supporting the hypothesis that antibiotics act as weapons in soil communities. Collectively, these results suggest that coevolutionary antagonistic interactions between Fusarium and Streptomyces in soil are driven by resource competition...|$|E
40|$|Strategies that utilize and {{increase}} native prairie species can improve fragmented and degraded grasslands in the Great Plains of North America {{and result in}} improved forage resources for domestic livestock, increased topsoil conservation, restoration of biodiversity, and enhanced wildlife habitat. One of the primary constraints to establishing native grasses, legumes, and forbs is weed interference. Studies were conducted from 1994 to 1998 {{to evaluate the use}} of imidazolinone herbicides for establishing and managing native grasses, legumes, and forbs. In experiments conducted in eastern Nebraska, imazethapyr [2 -[4, 5 -dihydro- 4 -methyl- 4 -(1 -methylethyl) - 5 -oxo- 1 H-imidazol- 2 yl]- 5 -ethyl- 3 -pyridinecarboxylic acid] and imazapic [(Â±) - 2 -[4, 5 -dihydro- 4 -methyl- 4 -(Imethylethyl) - 5 -oxo- 1 H-imidazol- 2 -yl]- 5 -methyl- 3 -pyridinecarboxylic acid] applied preemergence at 70 g ha- 1 improved the establishment of Illinois bundleflower [Desmanthus illinoensis (Michx.) MacMill. ], crownvetch (Coronilla varia L.), showy partridgepea, (Cassia chamaecrista L.), purple prairieclover (Dalea purpurea Vent.), and spiked liatris [Liatris spicata (L.) Willd. ]. Imazethapyr was less injurious than imazapic and also improved establishment of Canada tickclover [Desmodium canadense (L.) DC. ] and roundhead lespedeza (<b>Lespedeza</b> <b>capitata</b> Michx.). In other studies, imazethapyr and imazapic improved the establishment and dry matter yield of mixtures of Illinois bundleflower and big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman) when herbicides were applied in late-spring and annual grasses were controlled. In experiments with a seeded mixture of native mid-grasses, legumes, and asters, imazethapyr improved sideoats grama [Bouteloua curtipendulda (Michx.) Torr. ], little bluestem [Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash], purple prairieclover, Canada tickclover, and leadplant (Amorpha canescens Pursh.) establishment. Imazapic was more injurious to the planted species than in these experiments, particularly at a site in west-central Nebraska that had lower soil organic matter and higher pH than sites in eastern Nebraska. In experiments conducted on established stands of Illinois bundleflower and big bluestem, imazethapyr and imazapic applied post-emergence up to 105 g ha- 1 did not affect forage yields or big bluestem tiller development. Herbicide treatments often resulted in increased in vitro dry matter disappearance and crude protein and decreased neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber.

Research {{completed}} at Department of Biological Sciences, Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and SciencesUnderstanding the mechanisms that influence plant species diversity is critical to sustaining current levels of biodiversity. It is now recognized that soil microbial communities impact plant species interactions, but most {{studies have focused on}} mutualists such as mycorrhizae and rhizobium, while soil pathogens remain poorly understood. To address this bias, we tested the response of 17 plant species to the native, fungal pathogen Macrophomina phaseolina, the causative agent of charcoal rot disease. Species selection was based on anecdotal reports of genera susceptible to infection and common grassland plants in the area. Additionally, these species represented the three most common plant functional groups (graminoids, legumes, nonleguminous forbs) and all species were native to Kansas grasslands with the exception of Lespedeza cuneata, an invasive legume that outcompetes many native plants, and Glycine max (soybean), an agricultural crop that is a known host plant. Plants were grown under greenhouse conditions with each species exposed to either control soil or soil inoculated with M. phaseolina. Following a 3 month growth period, plant biomass was harvested and weighed. Additionally, for species of legumes, the total number and mean mass of nodules was quantified. The presence of M. phaseolina generally led to a reduction in total plant mass with the exception of Asclepias syriaca which appeared to tolerate the pathogen. Despite reduced performance, only Amorpha canescens experienced high levels of mortality (75 %) suggesting that this species is highly susceptible to charcoal rot. Root nodule formation occurred in three of the seven legume species examined: <b>Lespedeza</b> <b>capitata,</b> Lespedeza cuneata, and Lespedeza virginica. Of these species, differences in the number and mean mass of nodules was only observed in L. cuneata and L. virginica. Specifically, although the mean mass of nodules produced by L. cuneata remained constant between treatments, the number produced decreased when exposed to M. phaseolina. In contrast, the presence of M. phaseolina resulted in decreased nodule mass in L. virginica, however this also resulted in {{an increase in the number}} of nodules produced. These results suggest that the presence of M. phaseolina may influence grassland plant diversity by promoting the establishment of unique species assemblages throughout the community. Although most species experienced a decrease in performance, the amount of M. phaseolina used was potentially higher than natural levels. Future research should therefore examine varying densities of M. phaseolina in the soil and test the effects of M. phaseolina on competitive interactions between species.

40|$|Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV) {{and bean}} leaf beetles, Cerotoma trifurcata (Forster), both reduce yield and seed quality in soybean, Glycine max (L.). Numerous beetle species can {{transmit}} BPMV; however, recent outbreak populations of bean leaf beetles {{have contributed to}} an epidemic of BPMV in soybean in Iowa. The objective {{of this research was}} to understand or identify the contributing sources of the BPMV epidemic in nature and to study novel chemical control tactics for the management of this pest complex. To facilitate the measurement of leaf herbivory of leaves, a tool was developed for the digital measurement of leaf surface area. The effects of shape, size, and capture resolution on digital area measurement were investigated to accurately and precisely estimate leaf surface area. The results indicated that image capture resolutions of either 118. 16 or 236. 27 pixels cm- 1 (300 or 600 pixels in- 1, respectively) had the least bias for a variety of sizes and were least affected by shape geometry. Eighteen field-collected, perennial plant species were tested for the presence of BPMV and acceptability to bean leaf beetle herbivory. Five new food hosts, <b>Lespedeza</b> <b>capitata</b> (Michaux), Lotus corniculatus L., Trifolium alexandrinum L., T. ambiguum Bieberstein, and T. incarnatum L., were discovered for bean leaf beetles and one new host, Desmodium illinoense Gray, for BPMV. All of these plant species emerge prior to normal emergence times for soybean in Iowa. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence from the D. illinoense BPMV isolate (I-Di 1) was characterized. I-Di 1 was determined as a new natural reassortant of BPMV belonging to RNA- 1 subgroup I, RNA- 2 subgroup II. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences from BPMV isolates (I-P) from an adjacent soybean field were partially characterized. The I-P isolates were all of RNA- 1 subgroup II and thus {{do not appear to be}} related to I-Di 1. However, based on nucleotide sequence analysis the within-field isolate diversity is high. Soybean growers desire earlier planting dates and given the spring-feeding activity of the bean leaf beetle and the potential of early-season injury of soybean from BPMV infection, early planting dates are at risk. Therefore the effects of seedapplied and foliar insecticides on this pest complex were studied within the context of the currently-recommended management strategy: the use of insecticides to reduce F 0 and F 1 bean leaf beetle populations. The use of a seed-applied insecticide to target F 0 beetles (followed by a foliar insecticide application targeting F 1 bean leaf beetles) gave the greatest improvement in yield (0. 9 q ha - 1 [â¼ 1. 3 bu a- 1] at two locations in one year. However, seed quality was protected most if a foliar insecticide was used to suppress F 0 and F 1 beetles.

40|$|Restoration of {{resilient}} plant {{communities in}} response to environmental degradation is a critical task, and a changing climate necessitates the introduction of plant communities adapted to anticipated future conditions. Ecotypes of dominant species can affect associated organisms as well as ecosystem function. The extent of ecotypic variation in dominant tallgrass prairie species {{and the consequences of}} this variation for ecosystem functioning were studied by manipulating two potential drivers of plant community dynamics: climate and the soil microbial community. Climate was manipulated indirectly through the use of reciprocal restorations across a rainfall gradient where regional sources of dominant grasses Andropogon gerardii and Sorghastrum nutans were seeded with 8 other native species that occur in tallgrass prairie. Four dominant grass sources (originating from central Kansas [CKS], eastern Kansas [EKS], southern Illinois [SIL], or a mixture of these) were reciprocally planted within four sites that occurred across a precipitation gradient in western KS (Colby, KS), CKS (Hays, KS), EKS (Manhattan, KS) and SIL (Carbondale, IL). The three grass sources and mixture of sources were sown into plots according to a randomized complete block design at each sites (n= 16, 4 plots / block at each site). Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) was measured {{at the end of the}} 2010 and 2011 growing season at each site. In 2010, total ANPP declined from western to eastern Kansas, but increased across the geographic gradient in 2011. The dominant grasses did not comprise the majority of community ANPP in WKS, CKS or SIL in either year but did contribute most to total ANPP at the EKS site in 2011. In 2010, volunteer forbs comprised the largest proportion of ANPP in WKS, whereas and in both years planted forbs comprised the largest proportion of ANPP in SIL. Ecotypic variation in ANPP of A. gerardii was not evident, but Sorghastrum nutans ANPP exhibited a site by source effect in 2010 that did not suggest a home site advantage. Variation in the competitive environment at each site may have masked ecotypic variation during community assembly. Further, ANPP responses suggest that grasslands in early stages of establishment may respond more stochastically to climatic variation than established grasslands. Longer term studies will clarify whether ecotypes of dominant prairie grasses affect ecosystem function or community trajectories differently during restoration. Ecotypes of dominant species may support different soil microflora, potentially resulting in plant-soil feedback. A second experiment tested for local adaptation of prairie plant assemblages to their soil microbial community. Native plant assemblages from Kansas and Illinois were tested for local adaptation to their `home 2 Ì 7 soil by reciprocally crossing soil and plant source in a greenhouse experiment. Seeds and soil were obtained from two remnant prairies, one in eastern Kansas and one in central Illinois, with similar species composition but differing climate. Seeds of four species (Andropogon gerardii, Elymus canadensis, <b>Lespedeza</b> <b>capitata,</b> Oligoneuron rigidum) common to both locations were collected, germinated, and transferred to pots to create 4 -species assemblages from each region. Non-prairie (NP) soil from the edge of an Illinois agricultural field was also included as an inoculum treatment to increase relevance to restoration. Kansas and Illinois plant assemblages were subjected to a fully factorial combination of soil inocula [with associated microbial communities] (3 sources: KS, IL, NP) and soil sterilization treatment (sterilized or live). Plants were harvested after 20 weeks and soil was analyzed for microbial composition using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) markers. Soil sources had different nutrient concentrations and sterilization resulted in a flush of NH 4 +, which complicated detection of soil microbial effects. However, plant sources did exhibit variation in productivity responses to soil sources, with Kansas plants more responsive to live soil sources than Illinois plants. Despite confounding variation in soil fertility, soil inoculation was successful at manipulating soil microbial communities, and plant sources responded differently to soil sources. Consideration of feedback between soil and plants may be a missing link in steering restoration trajectories...|$|E
