5|$|Artificial <b>lighting</b> discourages nesting and {{interferes with}} the hatchlings' ability to {{navigate}} to the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of artificial <b>lighting.</b> On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around tall buildings, perhaps because they block out the man-made light sources. Loggerhead hatchlings are drawn toward the brighter area over the water which is the consequence of the reflection of moon and star light. Confused by the brighter artificial light, they navigate inland, away from the protective waters, which exposes them to dehydration and predation as the sun rises. Artificial <b>lighting</b> causes {{tens of thousands of}} hatchling deaths per year.|$|E

5|$|Both Edmundston and Rimouski were {{fitted with}} about 60 light projectors: {{those on the}} hull were on {{retractable}} supports; those on the superstructure were on fixed supports. Each ship's diffused <b>lighting</b> system was tested systematically in St Margaret's Bay, and then trialled when actually escorting Atlantic convoys in 1943. Experimentally, the diffused <b>lighting</b> reduced the ships' visibility by up to 70%, but at sea the electrical equipment proved too delicate, and frequently malfunctioned. Worse, the system was slow to respond to changes in background <b>lighting,</b> and the Canadian Navy considered the <b>lighting</b> too green.|$|E

5|$|Over the Stock Exchange floor, Pflueger {{mounted a}} ceiling {{composed}} of interconnected sheet metal strips above {{which he used}} indirect <b>lighting</b> to soften the edges and reduce shadows made by traders on the floor below. The result was so effective that Pflueger used it on a much larger scale above the audience seating at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, where it extended from and formed a continuity with the incised art on the proscenium. In Oakland, Pflueger flanked the stage with structures {{that appeared to be}} pillars supporting the proscenium but were instead layered, curved sheets of thin metal behind which <b>lighting</b> instruments cast light indirectly to give the columns a suffused glow. In 1931, he used the same concept to frame the stage at the Bal Tabarin (now Bimbo's 365 Club), and to bring a changing palette of color to the ceiling above the dance floor. Pflueger filed for and, in 1934, received two architectural <b>lighting</b> design patents, one for his ceiling grid with indirect <b>lighting</b> and one for the thin metal panels hiding <b>lighting</b> instruments.

5|$|According to John Carmack, {{the lead}} {{graphics}} engine developer at id Software, {{the technology of}} Doom 3 was supported by three primary features: unified <b>lighting</b> and shadowing, complex animations and scripting that showed real-time with fully dynamic per-pixel <b>lighting</b> and stencil shadowing, and GUI surfaces that add extra interactivity to the game. The key advance of the id Tech 4 graphics engine developed for Doom 3 is the unified <b>lighting</b> and shadowing. Rather than computing or rendering lightmaps during map creation and saving that information in the map data, most light sources are computed in real-time. This allows lights to cast shadows even on non-static objects such as monsters and machinery, which was impossible with static non-directional lightmaps. A shortcoming {{of this approach is}} the engine's inability to render soft shadows and global illumination.|$|E
