The knowledge base contains a generic hierarchical description of the document structure in terms of layout objects labeled logically. This allows the generation of hypothetic networks of linked objects in the blackboard. The specialists cooperate indirectly through the blackboard by updating the <b>layout</b> <b>object</b> descriptors. A blackboard modification causes an "event " to propagate up to some specific tasks. A task could then choose another subset of specialists to carry on with the process. Finally, a synthesized blackboard summary allows a task selector to focus efficiently on the most useful <b>layout</b> <b>object</b> to process. ...|$|E
40|$|An IC layout has {{to satisfy}} many {{technological}} design requirements. One {{of these is}} spacing, i. e., a <b>layout</b> <b>object</b> has {{to be separated from}} another one by some minimal distance. In addition, any spacing requirement (e. g. minimal distance between layout objects) varies depending on the particular features of the layout objects, e. g. the layer the objects belong to, the purpose of these objects, etc. A rule set (or script) of DRC commands allows a designer to separate objects with particular features and then to check them according to technological requirements. An important characteristic of a <b>layout</b> <b>object</b> is that it belongs to an electrical node as almost every geometrical object is a part of an electrical circuit, e. g. a wire, a drain, a gate, etc. The technological requirements for objects can be different depending on whether these objects belong to the same electrical node. Figure 1. DRC Spacing Check operation with the option C'. Object 1 and 2 belong to the layer NBL, object 3 - to the layer METL 1. Object 1 and 3 belong to the same electrical node. The information that defines whether layout objects belong to the same electrical node is called "connectivity data". This data can be used along with any spacing requirements during the rule checking If a designer is going to use DRC spacing check operations which take into account the connectivity information the option C or C ’ must be specified. The option C in a DRC check operation means the operation checks a spacing requirement only between the objects that belong to different electrical nodes. The option C ' means the operation checks the spacing requirement only between objects that belong to the same electrical node...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} a computer-based site layout model and focuses primarily on the project setup phase. The developed model has four modules: user interface, database, project module, and layout module. Setting up the project in the proposed model is {{carried out by the}} project module, utilizing open architecture concept. The main advantage in the open architecture is to allow for the incorporation of user-defined objects if they are not readily available in the model. The objects required to define a site layout problem are clustered into three tires: 1) Site Objects, 2) Construction Objects, and 3) Constraint Objects. The model is implemented in a CAD environment using an object-based approach. The structure of each of the three tires is described, and the mechanism of object selection/creation for a site layout project is explained. The paper describes the components required to implement an open architecture for site <b>layout</b> <b>object</b> selection along with their respective environments.

We present a migration flow which consists of two process steps: (1) conversion where shapes (such as polygons) are converted to simple geometric objects (such as sticks) while the topology is maintained, and (2) grid legalization for RDRs where the simple geometric objects are placed on grid subject to the given set of ground rules by using a novel legalization algorithm, the Minimum Perturbation-driven Graph-based Grid Legalization(MP-GGL) algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the flow by successfully migrating a set of library cells in the conventional shape-based technology to the simplified layouts with RDR constraints. 1...|$|E

40|$|Gestural {{interaction}} {{has been}} investigated as an interaction technique {{for many years and}} could potentially deliver more natural and intuitive methods for human computer interaction. As a novel input mode compared to traditional input devices such as keyboard and mouse, researchers have been applying gestural interaction in many dif- ferent domains. There are many different gestural interaction methods and systems which have been built for both research and mass production. However, most previous gesture user interfaces rely on hand held devices or the wearing of fiducial markers for gesture tracking. The freehand gestures, which are tracked by distance sensors with- out requiring users to hold or wear special devices, are not fully explored in previous research. Considering that freehand gestural interaction could be easier to use and deployed for ordinary users in every day life, further research should be conducted for designing effective freehand gestural interaction. In an effort to extend the knowledge and understanding of human factors and inter- action design issues relating to freehand gestural interaction, we first provided a review of related works, and analysed the characteristics, design space as well as the design challenges and opportunities of freehand gestural interaction. We then progressively investigated several aspects of freehand gestural interaction including option selection in 2 D and 3 D <b>layout,</b> <b>object</b> selection in densely populated environments and 3 D navi- gation in public settings. Based on the interaction design, prototype development and user evaluations, we gave the results of user performance, behaviour and preference. We also compared our findings with previous research to extend the state of art. Further- more, we extended the discussions to a set of practical design suggestions for effective freehand gestural interaction design for different scenarios and interaction tasks.

But because {{of a lot of}} shortcomings, such as inefficiency, simulated annealing algorithm will spend much time in solving a layout design question to complex mechanical products. Moreover, a lot of professional knowledge and expertise are required in practical layout design. So itfs limited to use simulated annealing algorithm in practical engineering. A Simulated Annealing Algorithm based on parallel cluster, and its application in optimal design for layout is presented. With the thinking of parallel cluster computing, ameliorative algorithm will be superior to the general simulated annealing algorithm. Because of the randomicity, the temperature of simulated annealing algorithm can be divided into small pieces, and each piece can be computed on different computer in LAN. We will collect results on current stage from every computer, {{so that we can get}} the best conclusion after comparing them. Then, the condition of computers in LAN will be adjusted in order to continue with a better point. The best number of computers which join in computing in the LAN and the best size of the temperature pieces are discussed, and the conclusion will be given. Mixing Message Passing Interface (MPI) and Visual C++, we will integrate Simulated Annealing Algorithm based on Parallel Cluster and Engineering Layout Design Support System. The <b>layout</b> <b>object</b> model and the process model of layout design are shared. Restraint and space of layout are defined. So the optimal algorithm, knowledge based on engineering and human computer interaction can be integrated in work. A simple object 3 D model based on XMLieXtensible Markup Languagejis developed to fit for the message translation. A grid server search strategy about computing resource based on Parallel Cluster is added in the algorithm, and a scheduling strategy based on remanent power of CPU resource is presented. The dynamic scheduling of computing power can fit for various internet environments and different nodes conditions. The cost of waiting time during synchronous process can be reduced. An engineering example about vehicle dynamical cabin layout design is presented to test validity of Simulated Annealing Algorithm based on parallel cluster. The result of testing shows that the computing time can be reduced more than 20 %, if appropriate temperature piece is chosen and seemly number of nodes is used. The integration of Simulated Annealing Algorithm based on parallel cluster and Engineering Layout Design Support System works with high efficiency, and it is convenient for engineers to use.
