50|$|The picture {{theory of}} language, {{also known as}} the picture theory of meaning, is a theory of {{linguistic}} reference and meaning articulated by Ludwig Wittgenstein in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.

50|$|Pictures {{have what}} Wittgenstein calls Form der Abbildung or {{pictorial}} form, which they share {{with what they}} depict. This means that all the logically possible arrangements of the pictorial elements in the picture correspond to the possibilities of arranging the things which they depict in reality. Thus if the model for car A stands {{to the left of}} the model for car B, it depicts that the cars in the world stand in the same way relative to each other. This picturing relation, Wittgenstein believed, was our key to understanding the relationship a proposition holds to the world. Although language differs from pictures in lacking direct pictorial mode of representation (e.g., it doesn't use colors and shapes to represent colors and shapes), still Wittgenstein believed that propositions are <b>logical</b> <b>pictures</b> of the world by virtue of sharing logical form with the reality which they represent (TLP 2.18-2.2). And that he thought, explains how we can understand a proposition without its meaning having been explained to us (TLP 4.02), we can directly see in the proposition what it represents as we see in the picture the situation which it depicts just be virtue of knowing its method of depiction: propositions show their sense (TLP 4.022).|$|R

The verbal subtests assess information (29 questions of general knowledge), comprehension (16 questions which focus on issues of social awareness), arithmetic (14 mental arithmetic brief story-type problems), digit span (sets of digits to repeat initially forwards then backwards), similarities (subjects asked to say how two seemingly dissimilar items might in fact be similar), and vocabulary (subject is asked to define 35 words). The performance part consists of tests arranging pictures (the subject is asked to arrange ten sets of small <b>pictures</b> into a <b>logical</b> sequence), <b>picture</b> completion (20 small pictures that all have one vital detail missing), block design (involves putting sets of blocks together to match patterns on cards), object assembly (four small jig-saw type puzzles), and digit symbol (Involves copying a coding pattern).|$|R
40|$|In {{this book}} chapter, we provide a {{tutorial}} introduction to one-way quantum computation {{and many of}} the techniques one can use to understand it. The techniques which are described include the stabilizer formalism and the <b>logical</b> Heisenberg <b>picture.</b> We highlight ways in which it is useful to understand one-way computation beyond simple equivalence with the quantum circuit model. We briefly review current proposals of implementations and experimental progress and summarize some recent related theoretical developments. Although the chapter is primarily didactic in focus, we include a number of new methods and observations. These include: a simpler and more compact formulation of one-way quantum computation in the stabilizer formalism; A new way of implementing unitaries diagonal in the computational basis; New results on the family of operations which may be implemented in a single round of measurements; A method for constructing compact one-way patterns by decomposing unitaries in terms of diagonal unitaries and Clifford group transformations.

Reynolds also said that [...] "getting philosophy into the game" [...] was one of the attractions of the game. Believing good science fiction thrives on constraint, the developers began with near-future technologies. As they proceeded into the future, they tried to present a coherent, <b>logical,</b> and detailed <b>picture</b> of future developments in physics, biology, information technology, economics, society, government, and philosophy. Alien ecologies and mysterious intelligences were incorporated into Alpha Centauri as external [...] "natural forces" [...] intended to serve as flywheels for the backstory and a catalyst for many player intelligences. Chris Pine, creator of the in-game map of Planet, strove to make Planet look like a real planet, which resulted in evidence of tectonic action.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} <b>logical</b> {{characterizations}} of <b>picture</b> languages of any dimension by syntactical fragments of existential second-order logic. Two classical classes of picture languages are studied: - {{the class of}} "recognizable" picture languages, i. e. projections of languages defined by local constraints (or tilings) : it {{is known as the}} most robust class extending the class of regular languages to any dimension; - the class of picture languages recognized on "nondeterministic cellular automata in linear time" : cellular automata are the simplest and most natural model of parallel computation and linear time is the minimal time-bounded class allowing synchronization of nondeterministic cellular automata. We uniformly generalize to any dimension the characterization by Giammarresi et al. (1996) of the class of "recognizable" picture languages in existential monadic second-order logic. We state several logical characterizations of the class of picture languages recognized in linear time on nondeterministic cellular automata. They are the first machine-independent characterizations of complexity classes of cellular automata. Our characterizations are essentially deduced from normalization results we prove for first-order and existential second-order logics over pictures. They are obtained in a general and uniform framework that allows to extend them to other "regular" structures...|$|R
40|$|A {{principal}} {{goal of the}} Budget Period I was {{to demonstrate}} that surface geochemistry {{could be used to}} locate bypassed hydrocarbons in old fields. This part of the program was successful. A surface geochemical survey, employing 5 different techniques, was carried out in the Spring and Summer of 2000 and a demonstration well, the State Vernon & Smock 13 - 23 HD 1 (permit number: PN 53945) was drilled in Vernon Township, Isabella County, Michigan in the late fall of 2000. A demonstration well was selected and drilled based on geologic considerations and surface geochemistry. Over 460 soil samples were collected and analyzed over the drill site. A good anomaly was detected near the proposed well site and the demonstration well, the Smock 13 - 23, was drilled to a depth of 3157 feet by November 17, 2000. Two laterals were drilled, and hydrocarbons were located in a zone approximately 175 feet in length. However, it was determined that the pay zone was too small and difficult reservoir conditions (water production) prevented putting the well in production. The Smock 13 - 23 was shut in and abandoned January 15, 2001. A post-mortem determined that the main reason the well was not economic was because the zone was nearly completely flushed by earlier recovery operations. The post mortem also revealed the presence of an unmapped shale plug crossing the first lateral. It appears that this shale was detected by the geochemical survey, but its significance was not appreciated at the time. It is possible that sections of the well were faulty, ''porposing'' up and down so as to create water blockages. We are continuing to use the Vernon Field and the demonstration well to calibrate the geochemical data. Eventually, this study may provide a standard site {{that can be used to}} test and calibrate geochemical anomalies, something that does not presently exist. A postmortem report on the well, including the geology and geochemistry used to site the well, is presented in Appendix I. Five geochemical techniques have been tested in Phase I. These include surface iodine, microbial, enzyme leaching, soil gas and subsurface iodine. We are most comfortable with the results of the microbial surveys but feel that direct measurement of soil gas is the best method if analytical difficulties can be overcome. The reason the microbial surveys are presently favored is because they provide a <b>logical,</b> consistent <b>picture</b> that is easy to interpret and easy to explain. This in turn is because the microbial anomaly is manifested as an ''apical'' as opposed to an ''edge'' or ''halo'' anomaly. Several lessons were learned during Phase I activities. The main one was that surface geochemistry could locate anomalies over old fields such as Vernon. We also learned that horizontal drilling has advantages and disadvantages in situations such as this. On the plus side, it does provide a means to probe for pockets of bypassed oil, but it is expensive relative to vertical (or slant wells?) and is difficult to control in a narrow pay zone. We tentatively conclude that horizontal wells do not provide a cost-effective solution in this setting and suggest that geochemical anomalies be investigated via a single vertical well or multiple vertical wells...|$|R

The goal of the thesis is to give a clear and <b>logical</b> <b>picture</b> of problems and situation. The analysis of both of those elements gives assumptions suitable for formulating of conclusions that may be taken as certain warnings and possible recommendations to potential investors...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} is {{an investigation into}} a visual language as my response and reading of the narrative related {{to a sense of}} place in an altered landscape: a space where humans have carved their autobiography into the earth. Robert Smithson, in the 1960 s characterised regions like these as the edges of post-industrialism or Nonspaces. They also exist as communities, holding onto an identity forged by their definitive history and cultural influences. Incorporated in the {{research is}} the exploration of ordinary or everyday landscapes within the context of Cultural Landscape studies. In focussing on the 'shaping' of the town and environs of Zeehan, a once burgeoning mining settlement on the West Coast mining strip of Tasmania, history, industrial archaeology and the impact on the natural environment are taken into account. Zeehan is a shadow of its dynamic past, a boom and bust story that is now enshrined in a local museum, and evident in the relics adorning the main street and surrounding countryside. It is a place of hidden history inextricably linked to the development of Tasmania. However in the new millennium the underground continues to be the lifeblood of this former silver boomtown. Seeking an appropriate format of presentation of this cultural landscape resulted in the development of installation-based artwork: an intersection between digital media, large-scale drawing and sculptural concepts. Re-interpreting and re-presenting the spirit of nature and technological interaction in the so-called Nonspace incorporates the exploration of a phenomenological approach as well as more formal methodologies. The research also examined the concept of the Nonsite. According to Smithson, the Nonsite was a representation or interpretation of a particular site: an abstract three-dimensional <b>logical</b> <b>picture.</b> With its integration of diverse media, the project relates to a field of artists and filmmakers working within the themes of Cultural Landscape (Jan Senbergs, Susan Norrie and Jem Cohen), Museum Strategy/Archaeology as Myth (Mark Dion, Alan McCollum), and The Grand Narrative (Joan Jonas, Kutlag Ataman and Bill Viola). I discuss their works in relation to matters concerning landscape and human intervention, historical discourse, fragmentation of time, the blurring of boundaries and the overlapping of genres. My original contribution to the field is to extend the presentation of the documentary film/video genre from an ostensibly two-dimensional medium to an installation based artwork within an art gallery space utilising the seemingly incongruent mediums of large-scale drawings and sculptural elements. Within this context the resulting narrative creates an environment, which both immerses the viewer and provides contemplation, presenting a re-interpretation of the Nonsite as reading of the Nonspace...|$|E
40|$|Astronauts find it {{difficult}} to recognize their orientation while facing any of the viewing directions in 6 -ported space station node modules. Our previous experiments tested the spatial memory of human subjects in 1 -G in an analogous cubic virtual environment and showed that humans are able to learn to orient when instructed to imagine different body orientations while facing in two different directions. Can subjects do the task when facing in all 6 directions? Does training help? Does spatial memory depend on the direction of remembered targets relative to the body? Does performance depend on the subject's ability to rotate himself mentally and use imagery? How long is ability retained after training? 3 D spatial learning was studied in two virtual cubic chambers, in which a picture of an animal was drawn on each wall. Through trial-by-trial exposures to a virtual chamber, subjects (n= 24) had to memorize the spatial relationships among the 6 pictures around them and learn to predict the direction to a specific picture if they were facing any wall in any roll orientation. After learning in one chamber, the procedure was repeated in a second. Before being tested, subjects received computer-based instructions and practice. Half of subjects were taught to remember <b>logical</b> <b>picture</b> groupings (strategy), while the remaining (control) subjects were free to do the task as they saw fit. Subjects' retention of configurational knowledge (both chambers) and spatial ability (second chamber only, without feedback) were re-tested 1, 7, and 30 days after initial training. Response time (RT) and percent correct (% correct) learning curves were measured on all four days, while configurational knowledge was tested on the last three. All subjects ultimately learned to do the task within 36 trials in either test environment, but performed faster in the second environment than in the first (especially the strategy-trained group). The strategy group showed superior % correct and RT for above/behind targets and generally better configurational knowledge. Retention of configurational knowledge and spatial ability for both groups was good over 30 days. The subjects who reported using mental imagery (n= 8) had higher scores on figure rotation tests and % correct for left/right targets. Performances by the control group on the experimental tasks were significantly correlated with those on conventional tests of field independence and 2 / 3 D figure rotation ability. Strategy training helped those who had poorer mental rotation skills, and those who could not use mental imagery.
