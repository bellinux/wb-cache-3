5|$|Nine years later, {{the four}} are {{once more the}} only beings on the ship. Rimmer is again a hologram, Holly is offline, and <b>Lister</b> is {{mourning}} Kochanski, lost to him out of an airlock some time previously. A chance {{to get back to}} Earth through a dimension warp presents itself; although it is not quite what it appears to be, it gives <b>Lister</b> new hope when he learns that Kochanski is still alive after all.|$|E
5|$|Temple had {{an older}} brother (John) and a sister (Susan). As {{a result of his}} mother's first marriage, he had two half-brothers (including Sir Thomas Peniston) and two half-sisters. He was born into a well {{connected}} family. His uncles included Sir Thomas Temple, 1st Baronet, of Stowe and William Fiennes, 1st Viscount Saye and Sele. His sister, Susan Temple, Lady <b>Lister,</b> was the mother of Martin <b>Lister</b> and the grandmother of Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough.|$|E
5|$|Zoe Carpenter is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the British Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks, played by Zoë <b>Lister.</b> The character first appeared on-screen on 1 September 2006, {{as one of}} three new students at Hollyoaks Community College. It was announced in 2009 that <b>Lister</b> had quit her role in order to pursue other projects; she subsequently left the series in January 2010. During Zoe's time in Hollyoaks she has been portrayed as a bubbly tomboy who often makes the wrong choices in life and has {{had a number of}} failed relationships. In March 2017, it was reported that <b>Lister</b> would be reprising the role and it was later confirmed that she would return for Amy Barnes' (Ashley Slanina-Davies) funeral. Her return aired on 24 April 2017.|$|E
50|$|Alfred Hitchcock is {{referenced}} by Rimmer {{when describing}} <b>Listers</b> silhouette. While using the toilet with <b>Listers</b> body, Rimmer hums The Grand Old Duke of York tune to himself. It is {{from this experience}} that Rimmer references Star Treks Spock when describing <b>Listers</b> urine. Rimmer also recites Clint Eastwoods line from Sudden Impact.|$|R

She was the {{daughter}} of Richard Jennings (or Jenyns), a Member of Parliament, and Frances Thornhurst; her paternal grandfather was Sir John Jennings, father, by his wife Alice Spencer, of an extraordinarily large family. Her uncle (Martin <b>Lister)</b> was a prominent naturalist. Richard Jennings came into contact with James, Duke of York (the future James II, brother of King Charles II), in 1663, during negotiations for the recovery of an estate in Kent (Agney Court) that had been the property of his mother-in-law, Susan <b>Lister</b> (nee Temple). James's first impressions were favourable, and in 1664 Sarah’s sister, Frances, was appointed maid of honour to the Duchess of York, Anne Hyde.|$|E
5|$|Several {{redundant}} locomotives {{were bought}} for preservation by Cliff Lawson of Tring. The group included three machines made by Ruston and Hornsby, two made by Hunslet, and two made by <b>Lister.</b> The eighth engine bought was the Diema, {{which was a}} hybrid made from the frames of two machines. Restoration involved splitting the components apart, and using them to rebuild both of the original locomotives, resulting in nine locomotives being preserved. Lawson re-gauged {{all of them to}} , and they have all been restored to working order. <b>Lister</b> 53977 was loaned to the Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery in 2007.|$|E

5|$|The series explores many science-fiction staples such as time-travel paradoxes (including the {{grandfather}} paradox), {{the question of}} determinism and free will (on several episodes), {{the pursuit of happiness}} in virtual reality and, crucially to the show's premise of <b>Lister</b> being the last human, the near-certainty of the human species' extinction some time in the far future.|$|E
5|$|The tenth series sees <b>Lister</b> still {{travelling}} with Rimmer, Kryten and Cat on Red Dwarf, {{in hopes}} of eventually locating Kochanski above getting back to Earth.

5|$|After {{passing the}} {{required}} examinations, Negus proceeded in 1909 {{to the next}} stage of his basic medical education at the nearby King's College Hospital, at that time located on Portugal Street between the Strand and Lincoln's Inn Fields. Three more years of study led to the attainment in 1912 of the MRCS and LRCP (Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons and Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, known as the 'conjoint diploma'), marking his formal qualification to practice medicine. In the final year of these studies, Negus was an usher at the funeral service for Lord <b>Lister</b> at Westminster Abbey. Another connection with Lister's generation came when Negus worked as surgical dresser and house surgeon under Sir William Watson Cheyne, who had himself been house surgeon to <b>Lister.</b> The postgraduate stages of Negus's training involved specialisation in diseases of the ear, nose and throat, a direction influenced and guided by the otorhinolaryngologist St Clair Thomson (1857–1943). In the years following his qualification in 1912, Negus worked at King's College Hospital, and had started further clinical training at the Hospital for Diseases of the Throat in Golden Square, Soho, but this was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War.|$|E
5|$|As can {{be discerned}} from the {{previous}} description, the 1945 campaign was anything but genteel and polite. Jolliffe replied by giving a radio speech (written {{with the assistance of}} <b>Lister</b> Sinclair) that accused Drew of running a political Gestapo in Ontario. In the speech excerpt below, Jolliffe alleged that a secret department of the Ontario Provincial Police was acting as a political police – spying on the opposition and the media.|$|E
5|$|Dave <b>Lister,</b> {{played by}} Craig Charles, is a genial Liverpudlian and {{self-described}} bum. He was the lowest-ranking of the 169 crew {{members on the}} ship before the accident. He has a long-standing desire to return to Earth and start a farm and/or diner on Fiji (which is under three feet of water following a volcanic eruption), but is left impossibly far away by the accident, which renders him the last (known) surviving member of the human race. He likes Indian food, especially chicken vindaloo, which is a recurring theme in the series.|$|E

There he encountered Major Charles Martin, formerly Professor of Physiology at the University of Melbourne and Director of the <b>Lister</b> Institute from 1903 to 1930.

5|$|In 1840, King's {{opened its}} own {{hospital}} on Portugal Street near Lincoln's Inn Fields, an area composed of overcrowded rookeries characterised by poverty and disease. The governance of King's College Hospital was later {{transferred to the}} corporation of the hospital established by the King's College Hospital Act 1851. The hospital moved to new premises in Denmark Hill, Camberwell in 1913. The appointment in 1877 of Joseph <b>Lister</b> as professor of clinical surgery greatly benefited the medical school, {{and the introduction of}} Lister's antiseptic surgical methods gained the hospital an international reputation.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, {{representative}} William J. Hughes of Whatcom County {{proposed the}} formation of a commission to adopt the state flag, consisting of the Governor, Secretary of State, and Adjutant General. Governor Ernest <b>Lister</b> became a supporter of the idea, issuing a call for designs from the state's citizens and city organizations. The campaign for a state flag, however, was opposed by patriotic groups like the Sons of the American Revolution and Sons of Veterans, finding the use of a state flag to be detrimental to the national flag.|$|E
