The Law, first {{introduced}} in 2011 by the Swiss federal government, aimed to lower, among other requirements, the residency requirement from 12 years to 8 years. During the parliamentary debates {{and the ensuing}} disagreements between the more conservative National Council (lower house) and the more liberal Council of States (upper house), the residency requirements were increased to 10 years. The time spent in Switzerland {{between the ages of}} 8 and 18 is doubled for purposes of applying for naturalisation, however, an applicant must spend at least 6 years in Switzerland. The new law also requires cantons to set a minimum residency requirement of between 2 and 5 years, as well as requiring applicants to have a permanent residency permit (Autorisation d'établissement), which is known as a C permit. Additionally, time spent in Switzerland with temporary admission (Permis d'admission provisoire) halved for purposes of applying for naturalisation. The 2014 Total Revision of the Federal Law Concerning the Acquisition and Loss of Swiss Nationality is scheduled to enter into force on 1 January 2018.|$|E

She auditioned unsuccessfully for Yves Boisset's Bleu comme l'enfer and Robin Davis's Hors <b>la</b> <b>loi,</b> but was eventually cast in My Brother-in-Law Killed My Sister (1986) by Jacques Rouffio opposite the popular French stars Michel Serrault and Michel Piccoli. This film was a critical and commercial failure. Binoche has commented that Rouffio's film is very significant to her career as it taught her to judge roles based {{on the quality of}} the screenplay and her connection with a director, not on the reputation of other cast members. Later in 1986, she again starred opposite Michel Piccoli in Leos Carax's Mauvais Sang. This film was a critical and commercial success, leading to Binoche's second César nomination. Mauvais Sang is an avant-garde thriller in which she plays Anna the vastly younger lover of Marc (Piccoli) who falls in love with Alex (Denis Lavant), a young thief.

2500|$|The {{ultimate}} task of a {{judge is}} to settle a legal dispute in a final and public manner, and thus affirm the rule of law. Before the trial, a pre-trial investigation collecting the facts has been conducted by police officials, such as police officers and coroners, prosecutors or public procurators. The court usually has three main legally trained court officials: the judge, the prosecutor and the defence attorney. The role {{of a judge}} varies between legal systems. In an adversarial system (common law), as in effect in the U.S. and England, the judge functions as an impartial referee, mainly ensuring correct procedure, while {{the prosecution and the}} defense present their case to a jury, often selected from common citizens. The main factfinder is the jury, and the judge will then finalize sentencing. Nevertheless, in smaller cases judges can issue summary judgments without proceeding to a jury trial. In an inquisitorial system (civil law), as in effect in continental Europe, there is no jury and the main factfinder is the judge, who will do the presiding, judging and sentencing on his own. As such, the judge is expected to apply the law directly, as in the French expression Le juge est la bouche de <b>la</b> <b>loi</b> ("The judge is the mouth of the law"). Furthermore, in some system even investigation may be conducted by the judge, functioning as an examining magistrate.|$|E

He had so put in evidence an empirical law. The importance which he granted to this result translates methodological conceptions very remote from those that Walras defended and we are, then, worn to think that Pareto takes back simply the methodological principles which Mill and Jevons had developed. This idea must be qualified. In his first works, Pareto appears as a heir of Mill, but, from 1897, he evolves towards a methodology which he considers as experimental. He pushes aside, in particular, the arguments upon which Mill called when he supported that the political economy is essentially an abstract science which leans on reasoning a priori.

40|$|The "Shōbōgenzō" {{preserved}} two sermons {{about life}} and death. The first, "Total operation" (1242), was written by Dōgen when he was fully mature. It is a treatise of a very intellectual type, discussing an active immanent process which holds {{the world to be}} a manifestation of the Buddha. The second one, "Life and death," of unknown date, was integrated much later, in the Ashikaga period, in a work called "The Secret Thesaurus" in the Edo period. The doctrine expounded shows affinity to those of "Total operation": the cycle of life and death is seen as constitutive {{of the life of the}} Buddha, as in other sermons in the "Thesaurus. " Nevertheless, the idea of an "extremely easy way," a quietist faith, and the fluid, non-rhetorical style, surprise us with their tone, so different from most of the other sermons. It has been thought that this sermon might be a fake, or a text written for a layperson, possibly even for the great Amidist Shinran. It also has been seen as a profession of faith from Dōgen himself. While other of his sermons reveal an essentially intellectual agnosticism, this one reflects a devotional pietism. Does this indicate the possibility that there were two separate individuals named of Dōgen, or rather was there an evolution in the thought the founder of Sōtô? At this time it seems impossible to choose between these two possibilities. In addition, it seems certain that this sermon is not part of the "Thesaurus. " Its interest lies in the fact that it brings to the exegete questions about interpretation of Dōgen 's work as well as questions about history of the compilation of his "Grand Œuvre"?Girard Frédéric.
