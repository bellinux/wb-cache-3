25|$|North-west of {{the station}} {{building}} is a steel-framed pedestrian overbridge and a <b>luggage</b> <b>lift,</b> both replacements for the original items, which are not of cultural heritage significance. North-west of the <b>luggage</b> <b>lift</b> is a 2005 stone cairn memorial to {{the building of the}} Kuranda Range Railway. A series of large garden beds continue along the platform to the north-west. An old steel telephone pole is located near the overbridge, on the town side. The former station master's residence is located north-west {{of the station}} platform, {{on the west side of}} the line. It is a timber building, clad in chamferboard with enclosed front and side verandahs and a hipped metal roof. A railway turntable is located further north-west.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} stations {{to be built in}} Australia using standard precast concrete units, Kuranda is the second oldest remaining example of its type in Queensland. Two earlier examples at Northgate (1911–12) and Chelmer (1913) in Brisbane have both been demolished, while another example opened at Ascot (Eagle Farm Racecourse) in February 1914 survives. A <b>luggage</b> <b>lift</b> from the overbridge to the platform, installed in 1915, was demolished after 1939, but a new lift with a shed at its base has been built since 1994.|$|E

50|$|Following {{the success}} of their go-karts, Rupp began {{manufacturing}} mini bikes beginning in 1962 until the mid 1970s. Models included the Dart Cycle, Continental, Roadster, Scrambler, Hustler, Chopper, Black Widow, Enduro, Roadster 2, Swinger, Sprint, Digger, Goat, Ram, TT-500, XL-500, XL-350 and others. Rupp minibikes were made in a variety of styles with various features, including varying engine sizes, lighting kits and color options. Rupp offered upgrades to their bikes as well, including speedometers, <b>luggage</b> racks, <b>lift</b> bars, horns, mud flaps and crash bars.|$|R
5000|$|Sōran Bushi {{accompanies the}} bon dance {{in many parts}} of Japan, and it has its own dancing styles that date back generations. The dance acts by acting ocean waves, {{fishermen}} dragging nets, pulling ropes and <b>lifting</b> <b>luggage</b> over their shoulders. This dance is taught in many schools across Japan as part of the curriculum.|$|R
50|$|The {{large number}} of tracks at the station can be {{explained}} by the density of rail traffic on the Dresden-Werdau line at that time. Originally the line between Hainsberg and Tharandt consisted of four tracks. At least two bank engines were always stationed at Tharandt station. As the trains on the line, such as the Dresden-Munich express, consisted of at least about seven four-axle express carriages, they needed pilot and bank engines to meet the time table. After the world wars nothing changed. In photographs, the Interzone trains from Görlitz to Munich, which had to make the climb on this section, are depicted with ten four-axle express carriages.The Dresden-Werdau railway was electrified in 1966. This had tremendous advantages for operations, since Tharandt station’s bank engines were no longer required. Heavy goods trains were hauled by two class E 42 locomotives and passenger trains were hauled by one locomotive of the same class. The track systems were subsequently simplified. An undated track plan no longer shows a locomotive shed. The largest structural changes were completed after 1989; the <b>luggage</b> transfer <b>lifts</b> on the island platforms were removed, but the exact date of this change is not known. Today only a single-storey building is visible on this platform. The tracks on the station forecourt were removed and replaced by a bus stop and extensive bicycle stands.|$|R

50|$|North-west of {{the station}} {{building}} is a steel-framed pedestrian overbridge and a <b>luggage</b> <b>lift,</b> both replacements for the original items, which are not of cultural heritage significance. North-west of the <b>luggage</b> <b>lift</b> is a 2005 stone cairn memorial to {{the building of the}} Kuranda Range Railway. A series of large garden beds continue along the platform to the north-west. An old steel telephone pole is located near the overbridge, on the town side.

50|$|Early {{passengers}} {{included many}} day visitors coming {{in large numbers}} from the Staffordshire Potteries to visit nearby Alton Towers, the country estate of the Earl of Shrewsbury. A <b>luggage</b> <b>lift</b> was installed to hoist the Earl's baggage up to Alton Towers. The station also comprised a three-storey tower which contained the Earl's suite of waiting rooms and its platform was made particularly long to satisfy the Earl's desire to have impressive surroundings in which to receive his guests.|$|E
500|$|In July 2014, Nash {{announced}} that the 2014–15 season would be his last. During the preseason, he experienced back pain, and further aggravated his back while <b>lifting</b> <b>luggage.</b> On October 23, {{less than a week}} before the start of what would have been the 40-year-old Nash's 19th year in the NBA, he was ruled out for the season due to a recurring back injury. Nash only played in three preseason games before he started to feel more pain in his back. Nash on injuring his back: [...] "Being on the court this season has been my top priority, and it is disappointing to {{not be able to do}} that right now. I work very hard to stay healthy, and unfortunately my recent setback makes performing at full capacity difficult. I will continue to support my team during this period of rest and will focus on my long-term health." ...|$|R
40|$|Kneeling in a {{restricted}} posture during manual materials handling {{has been associated}} with increased risk of low back pain. Little is known about the effect of kneeling posture on spinal loads. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare differences in spinal loading between kneeling and standing postures for lifting tasks. Twelve subjects asymmetrically <b>lifted</b> <b>luggage</b> of three weights to three heights from floor while kneeling. Three subjects also performed the same tasks from waist height while standing. An adapted free-dynamic EMG-assisted biomechanical model was used to calculate spinal loads. Statistical analysis showed that there was no difference in compression between kneeling and standing (p= 0. 9605), but kneeling resulted in increased anterior-posterior and lateral shear forces on the lumbar spine (p = 0. 0002 and p< 0. 0001, respectively). Spinal loading changes while kneeling in {{a restricted}} posture may increase the risk of low back injury and must be considered in ergonomic job design...|$|R

50|$|No {{information}} can be given on the station’s original tracks and platforms. After the expansion around 1909, the station had two intermediate platforms. The passengers {{had access to the}} island platforms via an underpass. The baggage was carried in a luggage transfer tunnel under the main tracks. There was access to the underpass and the <b>luggage</b> <b>lift</b> at the entrance building. The remains of the entrances to the island platforms can still to be seen on the railway side of the station building. The station originally did not have a platform next to the station building and the tracks next the station building were used for bank engines and for access to the goods shed.|$|E
50|$|The present Michaelstowe Hall {{dates from}} 1903, but the Michaelstowe Estate {{has a long}} and varied history which can readily {{be traced back to}} the Domesday Book of 1086. Located a few hundred yards to the east of Ramsey Parish Church, Essex Michaelstowe Hall is set back from the main Harwich road in 17 acres of {{landscaped}} grounds.Grade ll listed in 1987, the main three storey 1903 structure is of red Berkshire brick with white stone facings and a slated roof. Electric lighting was provided from the private lighting plant located near the stables. The main residence included seven family bedrooms, two fitted bathrooms, and a billiards room. A <b>luggage</b> <b>lift</b> and speaking tube served all three floors.|$|E
