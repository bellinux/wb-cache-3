Combs returned to Prestonsburg, set up a savings and <b>loan</b> <b>company,</b> and re-established his law practice. During the four years of Chandler's term, Combs accepted a number of speaking engagements, but otherwise remained out of the public eye. Meanwhile, the state's need for funds compelled Chandler to raise the state sales tax and other taxes, despite his campaign promises not to do so. Consequently, Chandler lost credibility and Combs gained a reputation as a courageous, forthright, and honest politician for having acknowledged the state's financial need during the campaign.|$|E

Despite crippling interest rates, high-cost credit sources (for example, doorstep lending, catalogue, rent-to-own and payday <b>loan</b> <b>companies)</b> are increasingly used by households that are excluded from mainstream financial services. The article discusses the range of credit sources used, reasons for reliance on high-cost credit and the exploitative practices of <b>loan</b> <b>companies.</b> It explores possible actions at household level through financial mentoring; the potential for developing alternative low-cost sources of credit; and campaigns for regulation of <b>loan</b> <b>companies...</b>|$|R

25|$|The Tennessee {{income tax}} {{does not apply}} to {{salaries}} and wages, but most income from stock, bonds and notes receivable is taxable. All taxable dividends and interest which exceed the $1,250 single exemption or the $2,500 joint exemption are taxable at the rate of 6%. The state's sales and use tax rate for most items is 7%. Food is taxed at a lower rate of 5.25%, but candy, dietary supplements and prepared food are taxed at the full 7% rate. Local sales taxes are collected in most jurisdictions, at rates varying from 1.5% to 2.75%, bringing the total sales tax to between 8.5% and 9.75%, one of the highest levels in the nation. Intangible property is assessed on the shares of stock of stockholders of any <b>loan</b> <b>company,</b> investment company, insurance company or for-profit cemetery companies. The assessment ratio is 40% of the value multiplied by the tax rate for the jurisdiction. Tennessee imposes an inheritance tax on decedents' estates that exceed maximum single exemption limits ($1,000,000 for deaths in 2006 and thereafter).|$|E

Menage's assistant, Donald Streeter, was tried twice but both trials ended with a hung jury. In an 1895 letter, Menage protested his innocence, blaming the Lyndale Farm lawsuit for hurting his finances and also noting (correctly) that: [...] "the practice of using another's name on a note or mortgage is not unknown in the business world." [...] In 1899, the charges against Menage were dropped after several key witnesses had died and others appeared reluctant to testify. By some accounts Menage was present in the courtroom at the time; others suggest he never returned to Minneapolis.|$|E
