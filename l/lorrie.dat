5000|$|In the mid 80's Scott and Carson asked Grand Ole Opry backup singer,Lorrie Morgan, {{to record}} {{some of their}} demos. Morgan had {{originally}} been signed to a record deal in 1979 but the arrangement advanced only limited success and her career was floundering. A couple of years later, Morgan married country singer Keith Whitley, and was signed to RCA at which point she recorded the album [...] "Leave the Light On", which included the song, [...] "Dear Me" [...] by Mateer and the late Carson Whitsett. It was doing well, climbing the charts of Billboard Magazine. Then, when her star husband, Keith Whitley, died of alcohol poisoning, the lyrics to Morgan's song suddenly took a new meaning. The lyrics perfectly fit this [...] "event" [...] that was happening in <b>Lorrie's</b> life. His death inadvertently changed Morgan's musical career. It became her first top ten single off the album.|$|R

Palmer departed at approximately 8:30a.m., informing Whitley {{to be ready to}} leave within an hour. Upon returning, Palmer found Whitley face down on his bed, fully clothed.|$|E
25|$|Whitley was a {{longtime}} alcoholic, who began drinking {{early in his}} career at bluegrass gigs, long before he was legally allowed to drink alcohol. Many times, he had attempted to overcome his alcoholism, but failed; and his pre-existing depression made it more challenging for him to quit. Moreover, Whitley preferred to drink alone, making it difficult for anyone to detect that he had a problem. According to <b>Lorrie</b> Morgan, she tried to conceal all alcoholic beverages from him at the home they shared, even going to the extent of binding their legs together before going to bed to make it impossible for Whitley to awaken {{in the middle of the}} night to consume a drink without her knowledge - only to discover that he would drink various items such as perfume and nail polish remover to get intoxicated.|$|E
25|$|Female {{artists such}} as Reba McEntire, Patty Loveless, Faith Hill, Martina McBride, Deana Carter, LeAnn Rimes, Mindy McCready, <b>Lorrie</b> Morgan, Shania Twain, and Mary Chapin Carpenter all {{released}} platinum-selling albums in the 1990s. The Dixie Chicks {{became one of the}} most popular country bands in the 1990s and early 2000s. Their 1998 debut album Wide Open Spaces went on to become certified 12x platinum while their 1999 album Fly went on to become 10x platinum. After their third album, Home, was released in 2003, the band made political news in part because of lead singer Natalie Maines's comments disparaging then-President George W. Bush while the band was overseas (Maines stated that she and her bandmates were ashamed to be from the same state as Bush, who had just commenced the Iraq War a few days prior). The comments caused a rift between the band and the country music scene, and the band's fourth (and most recent) album, 2006's Taking the Long Way, took a more rock-oriented direction; the album was commercially successful overall but largely ignored among country audiences. After Taking the Long Way, the band broke up for a decade (with two of its members continuing as the Court Yard Hounds) before embarking on a reunion tour in 2016.|$|E
