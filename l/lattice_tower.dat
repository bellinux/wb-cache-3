5|$|Tokyo is {{the most}} {{populated}} of Japan's 47prefectures. In Tokyo, there are 46buildings and structures that stand taller than 185metres (607ft). The tallest structure in the prefecture is Tokyo Skytree, a <b>lattice</b> <b>tower</b> that rises 634metres (2,080ft), which was completed in 2012. It also stands as the tallest structure in Japan, the tallest tower {{in the world and}} the 2nd-tallest freestanding structure in the world. The tallest building and third-tallest overall structure in Tokyo is the 256-metre-tall (838ft) Toranomon Hills, which was completed in 2014. The prefecture's second tallest building is Midtown Tower, which rises 54stories and 248metres (814ft) in height. Overall, of the 25tallest buildings and structures in Japan, 16are in Tokyo.|$|E

25|$|Most of the MOD-series wind {{turbines}} went to sites outside of Ohio, {{but the first}} unit, the MOD-0 operated at NASA's Plum Brook facility near Sandusky from 1975 to 1988. Initially the wind turbine had a <b>lattice</b> <b>tower,</b> a 38.1m diameter two-bladed rotor mounted downwind from the tower, and a capacity of 100kW. Lockheed Corporation manufactured the aluminum rotor blades. The discovery of severe stress resulting from the rotor blades passing through the tower's wind shadow led to several redesigns. In 1979, NASA rebuilt the MOD-0 with an upwind rotor mounted on a teetering hub, with a steel spar reinforcing the blades. In 1982, a tubular tower replaced the <b>lattice</b> <b>tower.</b> Finally, in 1985 NASA tested a single-bladed rotor with a teetering hub. In 1981, two NASA Glenn engineers, Larry Viterna and Bob Corrigan, used the adjustable-pitch blade feature of the MOD-0 to invent an analytical method for calculating wind turbine output in high winds, which has since become widely used in the wind power industry as the Viterna method.|$|E

500|$|The ground {{breaking}} {{happened on}} 22 June 1896, before {{the formation of}} the new company, completion of land purchase and announcement of contracts on 26 July 1896. The construction of the steel <b>lattice</b> <b>tower</b> started in July 1897 and was completed some time between 1898 and 1900, 10 years after the Blackpool Tower had been finished. The grounds were opened before then for a short period in 1897 however. New Brighton Tower was the tallest building in England, standing [...] tall, and [...] above sea-level. [...] A total of 1000 tons (1,016,047kg) of mild or low-carbon steel was used, at a cost of £120,000, in contrast to the earlier Blackpool and Eiffel towers, both constructed using wrought iron. The building below the New Brighton Tower, which was to contain the ballroom, was constructed by Peters and Sons of Rochdale. It was a four-storey red-brick building with arched windows and hexagonal, copper-domed turrets.|$|E

2500|$|The steel gridshells of the {{exhibition}} pavilions of the 1896 All-Russian Industrial and Handicrafts Exposition in Nizhny Novgorod were the first publicly prominent examples of Shukhov's new system. Two pavilions of this type were built for the Nizhni Novgorod exposition, one oval in plan and one circular. The roofs of these pavilions were doubly curved gridshells formed entirely of a lattice of straight angle-iron and flat iron bars. Shukhov himself called them azhurnaia bashnia ("lace tower", i.e., <b>lattice</b> <b>tower).</b> The patent of this system, for which Shukhov applied in 1895, was awarded in 1899.|$|E

30|$|<b>Lattice</b> <b>towers</b> {{are used}} in many civil {{engineering}} applications, typically including roofing structures and telecommunications and electrical power transmission towers. These structures are suited for weight minimisation and for reducing wind resistance. For structural design and analysis of <b>lattice</b> <b>towers,</b> the current industrial tools are finite element (FE) software packages combined with established design codes [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The majority {{of the work in}} published literature with regard to <b>lattice</b> <b>towers</b> concerns the analysis of electricity transmission towers [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. For the purpose of the work presented here, electricity transmission towers are particularly interesting because they have a mode of loading similar to that of wind turbines.|$|R
