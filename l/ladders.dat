5|$|Ryu has {{the ability}} to jump on and off <b>ladders</b> and walls, and by using the {{directional}} pad, he can climb up or down <b>ladders.</b> Ryu can spring off walls by holding the directional pad in the opposite direction he is facing and pressing the jump button. He cannot attack while on walls or <b>ladders.</b> Players can use this technique to get Ryu to climb up spaces between walls and columns by holding down the jump button and alternating between left and right on the directional pad. Ryu can also vertically climb a single wall by springing off it and then quickly pressing the directional pad back towards the wall.|$|E

5|$|The {{installation}} of dams dramatically altered {{the landscape and}} ecosystem of the river. At one time, the Columbia {{was one of the}} top salmon-producing river systems in the world. Previously active fishing sites, such as Celilo Falls in the eastern Columbia River Gorge, have exhibited a sharp decline in fishing along the Columbia in the last century, and salmon populations have been dramatically reduced. Fish <b>ladders</b> have been installed at some dam sites to help the fish journey to spawning waters. Chief Joseph Dam has no fish <b>ladders</b> and completely blocks fish migration to the upper half of the Columbia River system.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} the Raw Money in the Bank match, {{where all the}} wrestlers brought <b>ladders.</b> During the match, Evan Bourne {{performed}} his signature Air Bourne aerial maneuver, diving from a ladder and landing on the other wrestlers at ringside. Bourne and Miz went for the briefcase but Del Rio toppled their ladder, and Miz was taken backstage with a knee injury. The seven remaining wrestlers simultaneously climbed four <b>ladders</b> in the ring, but fell off one by one. With nobody left in the ring, Miz hopped down to the ring and climbed the ladder with one leg, but Mysterio stopped him by slamming him off the ladder with a sunset flip powerbomb. As Mysterio and Del Rio battled {{on top of the}} <b>ladders</b> for the briefcase, Del Rio distracted Mysterio by unmasking him and then pushing him onto another ladder, which tipped over and sent both wrestlers to the mat. Del Rio regrouped and unhooked the briefcase to win the match.|$|E
5|$|Although some in {{the front}} of the Mexican ranks wavered, {{soldiers}} in the rear pushed them on. As the troops massed against the walls, Texians were forced to lean over the walls to shoot, leaving them exposed to Mexican fire. Travis became one of the first defenders to die, shot while firing his shotgun into the soldiers below him, though one source says that he drew his sword and stabbed a Mexican officer who had stormed the wall before succumbing to his injury. Few of the Mexican <b>ladders</b> reached the walls. The few soldiers who were able to climb the <b>ladders</b> were quickly killed or beaten back. As the Texians discharged their previously loaded rifles, however, they found it increasingly difficult to reload while attempting to keep Mexican soldiers from scaling the walls.|$|E

5|$|Grant planned another assault for May 22, {{but this}} time with greater care; they would first reconnoiter {{thoroughly}} and soften up the defenses with artillery and naval gunfire. The lead units were supplied with <b>ladders</b> to ascend the fortification walls. Grant did not want a long siege, and this attack was to be by the entire army across a wide front.|$|E

Game length is approximately two to four hours, and it consists of ten levels.|$|E
