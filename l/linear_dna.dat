5|$|The {{cell nucleus}} {{contains}} {{the majority of}} the cell's genetic material in the form of multiple <b>linear</b> <b>DNA</b> molecules organized into structures called chromosomes. Each human cell contains roughly two meters of DNA. During most of the cell cycle these are organized in a DNA-protein complex known as chromatin, and during cell division the chromatin can be seen to form the well-defined chromosomes familiar from a karyotype. A small fraction of the cell's genes are located instead in the mitochondria.|$|E
5|$|Cell nuclei contain {{most of the}} cell's genetic material, {{organized}} as multiple long <b>linear</b> <b>DNA</b> molecules in complex with a large variety of proteins, such as histones, to form chromosomes. The genes within these chromosomes are the cell's nuclear genome and are structured {{in such a way}} to promote cell function. The nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression—the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell. The main structures making up the nucleus are the nuclear envelope, a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular cytoplasm, and the nuclear matrix (which includes the nuclear lamina), a network within the nucleus that adds mechanical support, much like the cytoskeleton, which supports the cell as a whole.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{methods for}} {{harnessing}} this system {{for use in}} editing mutations or insertions of specific E. coli sequences were published. This method includes constructing a plasmid consisting of the cas9 gene and CRISPR loci containing the matching target DNA, called single guide RNA (sgRNA). After expression is induced, Cas9 is {{able to identify the}} target DNA sequence of the cellular genome by finding the sgRNA complement and initiate strand breaks in the E. coli genome. This allows a transfected, <b>linear</b> <b>DNA</b> sequence to be incorporated into the genome, relying on the cellular machinery to use the <b>linear</b> <b>DNA</b> flanked by homologous regions specific to the cleaved location as a template to rebuild using homology directed repair.|$|E
40|$|Heretofore the DNA-directed coupled transcription-translation system, {{most useful}} in gene {{expression}} analysis, {{has been limited}} {{to the use of}} circular or long <b>linear</b> <b>DNAs.</b> <b>Linear</b> <b>DNAs</b> are degraded in this system by an exonucleolytic activity that can be eliminated by making the synthetic extracts from a suitable recB mutant of Escherichia coli. Using these extracts, we have examined the gene expression of a variety of <b>linear</b> <b>DNAs.</b> In particular, the complex pattern of expression of ribosomal protein genes and RNA polymerase genes in the rpoBC-rplLJ region has been analyzed by comparing the protein products obtained when using lambda rifd 18 DNA with the product obtained when using the same DNA segmented with various restriction enzymes. The results obtained confirm the conclusions of others obtained by much more elaborate in vivo techniques. It seems highly likely that this cell-free system will have extensive applications in the area of analysis of gene expression...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBAL 31 {{nuclease}} {{is known}} to possess two sorts of catalytic activities: one is a single-strand-specific endonuclease activity that converts negatively supercoiled UNA to the unit-length linear form, the other being a quasi-processive exonuclease activity that simultaneously degrades both 3 '- and 5 '-termini of <b>linear</b> dúplex <b>DNA.</b> Netropsin, a bactericidal and antiviral compound, was found to enhance the former activity but inhibit the latter. Netropsin-bound supercoiled plasmid DNA {{had a tendency to}} be fragmented by BAL 31 into several species of <b>linear</b> <b>DNAs</b> smaller than full-length size. Size reduction of <b>linear</b> plasmid <b>DNA</b> by BAL 31 was significantly inhibited by netropsin binding...|$|R
40|$|Large {{circular}} amplified DNAs (30 and 85 kb) {{present in}} methotrexate-resistant Leishmania major appear to migrate anomalously in pulsed field-gradient electrophoresis (PFGE), exhibiting pulse time-dependent mobility and migrating along a different apparent path {{relative to the}} large <b>linear</b> chromosomal <b>DNAs.</b> Quantitative studies indicate that the relative pulse-time dependence is actually conferred by the mobility properties of the large <b>linear</b> <b>DNAs.</b> One contributing factor to the difference in migration path is variability in the intrinsic voltage-dependence of mobility of supercoiled and <b>linear</b> <b>DNAs,</b> {{in combination with the}} asymmetrical/inhomogeneous voltage gradients. Certain linear chromosomes exhibit a previously undescribed pulse-time dependence in the voltage-dependence of mobility. When enzymatically relaxed or physically nicked the large circular DNAs fail to leave the well using any pulse time, a property also observed in conventional electrophoresis. These findings are relevant to PFGE theory, and its application to the study of circular DNA amplification in Leishmania and other species...|$|R
25|$|The λ-red {{system has}} also been {{optimized}} for scarless recombination; however, this is a two-step system consisting of selection and counterselection. In this case, a gene cassette with a dual selectable marker {{can be incorporated into}} the DNA at the specific location of mutagenesis. After selection of recombinants, a subsequent transformation to transfect <b>linear</b> <b>DNA</b> with the desired mutation is performed, which will then be homologously recombined into the cellular DNA in place of the marker. Therefore, counterselection against the cells containing the marker needs to be performed in order to identify the cells that have successfully incorporated the <b>linear</b> <b>DNA</b> into the target sequence. This can be verified using PCR screening.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{dimerized}} λ gam binds to {{the host}} RecBCD and SbcCD nucleases, inhibiting all of their known activities, which prevents degradation of the linear foreign DNA. λ exo binds to double stranded linear transformed DNA and processively degrades it in a 5’ to 3’ direction. Exo is a globular, trimeric protein that forms a ring shape with a hollow center that positions the <b>linear</b> <b>DNA</b> for cleavage. One side of the ring {{is large enough to}} admit double stranded DNA, but the other end can only accommodate single stranded DNA, therefore providing details into the exo mechanism of action. This process results in single stranded 3’ overhangs on the <b>linear</b> <b>DNA.</b> Subsequently, λ beta, a member of a recombinase family, binds to the 3’ overhangs and mediates annealing to the complementary E. coli DNA. This process occurs through invasion of the single stranded 3’ overhang into the complementary target DNA on the lagging strand during DNA synthesis, allowing beta-facilitated annealing.|$|E
25|$|Reisch and Prather pioneered a {{technique}} that combines both the λ-red and CRISPR/Cas9 recombination systems to form a novel methodology called no-SCAR (Scarless Cas9 Assisted Recombineering) for E. coli genome modifications. In this method, a plasmid containing the gene for Cas9 expression (cas9) is first transformed into E. coli cells. After selecting for the transformants using antibiotic resistance, another plasmid containing the targeted gene {{of interest in the}} form of sgRNA and the λ-red operon is transfected. After induced expression of the λ-red recombineering system, <b>linear</b> <b>DNA</b> to be incorporated into the E. coli genome is transformed into the cells. The expression of Cas9 and the sgRNA are then induced, which results in the Cas9 locating the E. coli target DNA based on the sgRNA complement. Cas9 is able to initiate a double strand break and the λ-red system is able to bring the <b>linear</b> <b>DNA</b> to E. coli genome for homologous recombination. The cells are then cured of the plasmid containing the specific sgRNA and then the next plasmid containing the specific sgRNA target sequence can be transformed and the process is repeated.|$|E

These regions were distributed across the genome and, on average, were primarily of plus-strand DNA.

25|$|A {{human cell}} has genetic {{material}} {{contained in the}} cell nucleus (the nuclear genome) and in the mitochondria (the mitochondrial genome). In humans the nuclear genome is divided into 46 <b>linear</b> <b>DNA</b> molecules called chromosomes, including 22 homologous chromosome pairs {{and a pair of}} sex chromosomes. The mitochondrial genome is a circular DNA molecule distinct from the nuclear DNA. Although the mitochondrial DNA is very small compared to nuclear chromosomes, it codes for 13 proteins involved in mitochondrial energy production and specific tRNAs.|$|E
25|$|DNA ligase only recognizes {{and acts}} {{on the ends}} of <b>linear</b> <b>DNA</b> molecules, usually {{resulting}} in a complex mixture of DNA molecules with randomly joined ends. The desired products (vector DNA covalently linked to foreign DNA) will be present, but other sequences (e.g. foreign DNA linked to itself, vector DNA linked to itself and higher-order combinations of vector and foreign DNA) are also usually present. This complex mixture is sorted out in subsequent steps of the cloning process, after the DNA mixture is introduced into cells.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} transformation efficiency, transformed cells are grown in super optimal broth to expedite the recovery process after transformation. In this method, two subsequent transformations must be performed in order to incorporate the pCas9cr4 and pKDsg-XXX plasmids necessary for recombination. This is because preliminary studies found that when both Cas9 and sgRNA were expressed {{at the same time}} without the <b>linear</b> <b>DNA</b> to be incorporated into the genome, cell death was induced due to the disruption of the crucial gene. Therefore, the expression of the recombination machinery and sgRNA were kept under strict control and transformed stepwise to reduce cell lethality.|$|E

40|$|<b>Linear</b> viral <b>DNA</b> {{present in}} cytoplasmic {{extracts}} of cells newly infected with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 can be induced to form 1 -LTR and 2 -LTR circles by incubation of the extracts {{in the presence of}} added nucleoside triphosphates. No circular DNA forms are detected when extracts are incubated in the absence of added nucleoside triphosphates. Restriction enzyme analysis and polymerase chain reaction analysis with selected primers, as well as DNA sequence analysis of the polymerase chain reaction products, show that most of the 2 -LTR circles are the result of autointegration reactions, while 1 -LTR circles result from recombination between the long terminal repeats on the <b>linear</b> viral <b>DNA.</b> In addition, a small amount of simple 2 -LTR circles, formed by end-to-end joining of the <b>linear</b> viral <b>DNA,</b> is formed in vitro. Integration of the <b>linear</b> viral <b>DNA</b> into heterologous DNA competes effectively with the formation of 2 -LTR circles by autointegration. However, concentrations of target DNA which completely block autointegration have no effect on the formation of 1 -LTR circles or simple 2 -LTR circles. Factors present in extracts of uninfected cells can mediate the formation of 1 -LTR circles and simple 2 -LTR circles from purified deproteinated <b>linear</b> viral <b>DNA,</b> indicating that viral proteins are not necessary for the formation of these two types of circular viral DNA. These experiments demonstrate that all the transformations of <b>linear</b> viral <b>DNA</b> which occur in the nuclei of cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 can be reproduced in vitro...|$|R
25|$|First, optimal oligo {{length for}} the {{transfected}} <b>linear</b> <b>DNA</b> should be between 60 and 90 base pairs. This guideline {{is based on}} previous observations that this length has the highest allelic replacement efficiency. Longer oligos are prone to forming hairpin structures that are not only inhibitory, but also are more expensive to synthesize. Shorter oligos have lower hybridization energies, resulting in decreased stability of the oligo to the chromosomal target. Of this sequence, at least 15 base pairs should be homologous to the target sequence at both the 5’ and 3’ ends to provide sufficient oligo annealing.|$|E
25|$|The λ-red recombineering {{system was}} {{published}} in 2000 and allows for insertion, deletion, or mutations to E. coli genes. In this system, the red operon from bacteriophage λ is transfected into E. coli cells to facilitate incorporation of linear target DNA into the E. coli genome. The bacteriophage λ-red operon consists of the exo, bet, and gam genes which, together, are responsible for recombineering. Phage λ exonuclease (exo) degrades transfected linear target DNA from the 5’ end. Beta binds to the resulting single stranded 3’ end and incorporates it into the target DNA to form the recombinant DNA. Phage λ gamma is necessary to inhibit E. coli nuclease activity and protect the transformed <b>linear</b> <b>DNA</b> in vivo.|$|E
25|$|Animal herpes viruses {{all share}} some common properties. The {{structure}} of herpes viruses {{consists of a}} relatively large double-stranded, <b>linear</b> <b>DNA</b> genome encased within an icosahedral protein cage called the capsid, which is wrapped in a lipid bilayer called the envelope. The envelope is joined to the capsid {{by means of a}} tegument. This complete particle is known as the virion. HSV-1 and HSV-2 each contain at least 74 genes (or open reading frames, ORFs) within their genomes, although speculation over gene crowding allows as many as 84 unique protein coding genes by 94 putative ORFs. These genes encode a variety of proteins involved in forming the capsid, tegument and envelope of the virus, as well as controlling the replication and infectivity of the virus. These genes and their functions are summarized in the table below.|$|E
40|$|<b>Linear</b> {{hepadnavirus}} <b>DNA</b> {{in primary}} hepatocyte cultures efficiently participates in intra- and intermolecular nonhomologous recombination at its ends. The products of this recombination are (i) monomeric covalently closed circular DNAs (cccDNAs) with deletions and insertions around {{the site of}} joining and (ii) oligomeric forms in which monomers are joined near the ends in random orientation. A fraction of monomeric cccDNAs can serve as intermediates in further DNA replication through at least five generations of nonhomologous recombination in a process we call illegitimate replication. We suggest that the monomeric and oligomeric <b>linear</b> <b>DNAs</b> produced by illegitimate replication may be precursors of the integrated and other high-molecular-weight hepadnaviral DNA forms seen in chronic infection...|$|R

25|$|Following λ-red operon {{activity}} induction, a linear, double-stranded cassette encoding a selectable marker, such as antibiotic resistance, {{is transformed}} into the cells {{in place of the}} target gene and incorporated into the DNA behind a specific inducible promoter. This allows for growth selection of the recombinant cells with proper insertion location verified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Specific incorporation can be achieved by including flanking PCR primers around the inserted <b>linear</b> <b>DNA</b> that are complement to the targeted insertion site. After selection of the recombinants, a second transformation is needed to remove the selective marker. A plasmid expressing flippase (FLP) can be transformed into the recombined cells, which can specifically cleave FLP recognition target sites (FRTs) flanking the antibiotic resistance gene. While this successfully removes the selective marker from the genome, it leaves FRT scars in place of the target gene.|$|E
25|$|Unlike eukaryotes, the {{bacterial}} DNA is not enclosed {{inside of}} a membrane-bound nucleus but instead resides inside the bacterial cytoplasm. This means that the transfer of cellular information through the processes of translation, transcription and DNA replication all occur within the same compartment and can interact with other cytoplasmic structures, most notably ribosomes. The bacterial DNA is not packaged using histones to form chromatin as in eukaryotes but instead exists as a highly compact supercoiled structure, the precise nature of which remains unclear. Most bacterial chromosomes are circular although some examples of <b>linear</b> <b>DNA</b> exist (e.g. Borrelia burgdorferi). Along with chromosomal DNA, most bacteria also contain small independent pieces of DNA called plasmids that often encode for traits that are advantageous but not essential to their bacterial host. Plasmids can be easily gained or lost by a bacterium and can be transferred between bacteria {{as a form of}} horizontal gene transfer. So plasmids can be described as an extra chromosomal DNA in a bacterial cell.|$|E
25|$|Following {{successful}} recombination of the <b>linear</b> <b>DNA</b> to {{the target}} genome, plasmid origins and markers can be re-used {{as a result of}} the plasmid curing method. The pKDsgRNA contains a temperature sensitive open reading frame which, when grown at 37oC, denatures the plasmid. This allows for easy plasmid curing that does not include any additional reagents. This is useful because upon curing of the pKDsg-XXX plasmid, another pKDsg-XXX plasmid with a different sgRNA can subsequently be transfected into the E. coli cells to introduce further mutations {{to the target}} cellular sequences. After all mutations are introduced, both plasmids should be cured. Unfortunately, the pCas9cr4 plasmid lacks an inherent curing mechanism, so Reisch and Prather pioneered a plasmid curing mechanism by introducing a pKDsgRNA whose sgRNA is complement to the pCas9cr4 plasmid. Specifically, they constructed a pKDsg-p15A which targeted the p15A origin of replication of the pCas9cr4 plasmid. After recombinants were selected for, expression of Cas9 and sgRNA was induced with the addition of aTc. After plating on selective plates and growing at 37oC, they observed no colony formation on the LB plates containing chloramphenicol indicating loss of the pCas9cr4 plasmid due to a Cas9-mediated double strand break in the plasmid. Additional plasmid mini-preps demonstrated that neither plasmid was retained in the cells, therefore indicating plasmid curing. This technique can easily be applied to curing other plasmids as well.|$|E

40|$|Avian {{leukosis}} viruses of subgroups B, D, and F are cytopathic {{for chicken}} cells, whereas viruses of subgroups A, C, and E are not. The amounts of unintegrated <b>linear</b> viral <b>DNA</b> in cells {{at different times}} after infection with cytopathic or noncytopathic viruses were determined by hybridization and transfection assays. Shortly after infection, there is a transient accumulation of unintegrated <b>linear</b> viral <b>DNA</b> in cells infected with cytopathic avian leukosis viruses. By 10 days after infection, the majority of this unintegrated viral DNA is not present in the infected cells. The transient cytopathic effect seen in these infected cells also disappears by this time. Low amounts of unintegrated <b>linear</b> viral <b>DNA</b> persist in these cells. Cells infected with noncytopathic viruses do not show this transient accumulation of unintegrated viral DNA. Cells infected with cytopathic viruses and subsequently grown {{in the presence of}} neutralizing antibody do not show the transient accumulation of unintegrated viral DNA or cytopathic effects. These results demonstrate a correlation between envelope subgroup, transient accumulation of unintegrated <b>linear</b> viral <b>DNA,</b> and transient cell killing by avian leukosis viruses.

500|$|The most {{controversial}} model, known as viral eukaryogenesis, posits that the membrane-bound nucleus, {{along with other}} eukaryotic features, originated from the infection of a prokaryote by a virus. The suggestion is based on similarities between eukaryotes and viruses such as <b>linear</b> <b>DNA</b> strands, mRNA capping, and tight binding to proteins (analogizing histones to viral envelopes). One version of the proposal suggests that the nucleus evolved in concert with phagocytosis to form an early cellular [...] "predator". Another variant proposes that eukaryotes originated from early archaea infected by poxviruses, {{on the basis of}} observed similarity between the DNA polymerases in modern poxviruses and eukaryotes. It has been suggested that the unresolved question of the evolution of sex could be related to the viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis.|$|E
2500|$|In calcium {{chloride}} transformation, the cells are prepared by chilling {{cells in the}} presence of [...] (in [...] solution), making the cell become permeable to plasmid DNA.

Protocols, however, exist for making supercompetent cells that may yield a transformation efficiency of over 109. The chemical method, however, usually does not work well for <b>linear</b> <b>DNA,</b> such as fragments of chromosomal DNA, probably because the cell's native exonuclease enzymes rapidly degrade <b>linear</b> <b>DNA.</b> [...] In contrast, cells that are naturally competent are usually transformed more efficiently with <b>linear</b> <b>DNA</b> than with plasmid DNA.|$|E
