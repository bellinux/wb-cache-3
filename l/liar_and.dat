5|$|The Bible {{is central}} in Zwingli's {{work as a}} {{reformer}} and is crucial {{in the development of}} his theology. Zwingli appealed to scripture constantly in his writings. This is strongly evident in his early writings such as Archeteles (1522) and llarity and Certainty of the Word of God (1522). He believed that man is a <b>liar</b> <b>and</b> only God is the truth. For him scripture, as God's word, brings light when there is only darkness of error.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the main}} characters, only Otho is not morally contemptible. Agrippina is an unscrupulous schemer; Nero, while not yet the monster he would become, is pampered and hypocritical; Claudius is pompous, complacent, and {{something}} of a buffoon, while Poppaea, the first of Handel's sex kittens, is also a <b>liar</b> <b>and</b> a flirt. The freedmen Pallas and Narcissus are self-serving and salacious. All, however, have some redeeming features, and all have arias that express genuine emotion. The situations in which they find themselves are sometimes comic, but never farcical—like Mozart in the Da Ponte operas, Handel avoids laughing at his characters.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Ben tells Jack {{that they}} had a perfect plan to convince Jack to operate on Ben's spine, but it failed when Jack saw the X-rays. Afterwards, Juliet brings to Jack's cell a movie, which consists of Juliet speaking through cue cards. As Juliet discusses how the surgery will proceed, on the tape she tells Jack that Ben is a <b>liar</b> <b>and</b> very dangerous, and thus the surgery should be intentionally botched to kill Ben, and that she will protect Jack if he does so.|$|E

5|$|After leaving politics, Hastings {{returned}} to {{his work as a}} barrister, and eventually surpassed even his previous reputation and success as an advocate. His first major case after returning was representing F. A. Mitchell-Hedges, a noted professional explorer, in his libel action against London Express Newspapers, the owner of the Daily Express. The Daily Express had published two articles saying that he was a <b>liar,</b> <b>and</b> had planned out a bogus robbery to advertise a device known as the Monomark. The case opened on 9 February 1928 in front of Lord Hewart, with Hastings and Norman Birkett representing Mitchell-Hedges and William Jowitt and J.B. Melville representing London Express Newspapers. Despite the skills of both Hastings and Birkett, who later became a much-lauded barrister in his own right, Mitchell-Hedges lost his case and had his reputation destroyed as a result.|$|E
5|$|After several failed {{attempts}} to find another school for Chris, Lois asks her father, Carter Pewterschmidt, to utilize his superior influence to get Chris admitted to the upper-class Morningwood Academy, which he agrees to {{on the condition that}} Peter humiliate himself by starring in a shot-by-shot remake of Liar <b>Liar,</b> <b>and</b> eventually succeeds in doing so. At his new school, Chris is shunned by the wealthy students at the academy, being both verbally and physically assaulted, including being hit with socks full of paper money. After hearing this, Lois again turns to her father to help Chris, by inviting him to {{become a member of the}} Skull and Bones society with the other students, who eventually come to accept him.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{resuming}} his naval duties, Scott {{revealed to}} the Royal Geographical Society his intention to return to Antarctica, but the information was not at that stage made public. Scott was forestalled by Shackleton, who early in 1907 announced his plans to lead an expedition with the twin objectives of reaching the geographic and magnetic South Poles. Under duress, Shackleton agreed not to work from McMurdo Sound, which Scott was claiming as his own sphere of work. In the event, {{unable to find a}} safe landing elsewhere, Shackleton was forced to break this promise. His expedition was highly successful, its southern march ending at 88°23′, less than 100 geographical miles from the South Pole, while its northern party reached the location of the South Magnetic Pole. However, Shackleton's breach of his undertaking caused a significant break in relations between the two men, with Scott dismissing his former companion as a <b>liar</b> <b>and</b> a rogue.|$|E

5|$|Teresa Elena De Simone (24 June 19575 December 1979) {{was murdered}} in Southampton, England, in 1979. Her murder led {{to one of the}} longest proven cases of a {{miscarriage}} of justice in English legal history. The murder occurred outside the Tom Tackle pub and {{was the subject of a}} three-year police investigation which resulted in the arrest of Sean Hodgson. Over the course of his 15-day trial it was revealed that Hodgson was a pathological <b>liar</b> <b>and</b> had confessed to numerous crimes, including some that he could not have committed and others that did not appear to have happened. Hodgson was convicted of the murder by a unanimous jury verdict in 1982 and was sentenced to life imprisonment. After serving 27 years in prison he was exonerated and released in March 2009. DNA analysis of semen samples that had been preserved from the original crime scene showed that they could not have come from him.|$|E
5|$|In the 1959 gubernatorial primary, Chandler {{threw his}} support to Lieutenant Governor Harry Lee Waterfield. The anti-Chandler forces {{eventually}} put forth Bert Combs as their nominee again. Having {{learned from his}} previous campaign, Combs now attacked Chandler for allegedly requiring state employees to donate 2% of their salaries to his campaign. According to Combs, Chandler had deposited the money in a Cuban bank, but the money was lost when Fidel Castro overthrew {{the government in the}} Cuban Revolution. Ultimately, Combs prevailed in the primary by a vote of 292,462 to 259,461. Republicans nominated John M. Robsion, Jr. to oppose Combs, and when Democratic President Harry S. Truman came to Paducah to campaign for Combs, Chandler refused to welcome him to the state, a customary duty of the sitting governor. Instead, in a letter to Truman, Chandler launched a blistering attack on his party's nominees, calling Combs a <b>liar</b> <b>and</b> alleging that his running mate, Wilson W. Wyatt, who had previously served in Truman's administration, had actually tried to undermine Truman by helping found Americans for Democratic Action. Combs ultimately won the general election by a wide margin.|$|E
5|$|The series {{revolves}} around the lives of Jaypaw, Lionpaw and Hollypaw, kits of Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight and grandchildren of the ThunderClan leader Firestar. The three slowly {{come to terms with}} their unique paths in life; Lionpaw worries about his thirst for blood on the battlefield, Hollypaw considers {{what it means to be}} truly loyal to her Clan, and Jaypaw is bitter that he was born blind. One day, Jaypaw unintentionally discovers a prophecy that he believes refers to him and his siblings. The three attempt to understand their new destinies, and realize that Lionpaw has the power to never be harmed in battle, whilst Jaypaw can walk in the dreams and read the minds of other cats. Hollypaw, on the other hand, struggles to determine what her unique power is. Hollypaw and Lionpaw are made warriors, becoming Hollyleaf and Lionblaze respectively, whilst Jaypaw becomes a medicine cat and is later given the name Jayfeather. They seek the advice of a mysterious loner named Sol, who promises to give them the answers to their destinies; however, they eventually realize him to be a deceptive <b>liar,</b> <b>and</b> he is banished from the forest. Although uncertain of their powers, the three cats are always secure in the knowledge that they are deeply loved by their parents. This safe haven is shattered when they are forced into a fire by Ashfur, another ThunderClan warrior. Ashfur wishes to murder the three cats in order to punish their mother, Squirrelflight, for rejecting his love years earlier. However, Squirrelflight admits that the three cats are not her offspring, and Ashfur lets them go. The siblings are deeply distressed by this confession, and attempt to discover who their true parents are. They eventually learn that their mother is Leafpool, the ThunderClan medicine cat, and their father is Crowfeather, a WindClan warrior. Hollyleaf is devastated by this, and murders Ashfur in revenge. Unsatisfied, she then publicly announces to the rest of the Clans the true story of her heritage. When the Clans do not praise her for her honesty, but rather react with shock and confusion, Hollyleaf runs away into a series of collapsing tunnels. Presuming her to be dead, and numb with grief for their sister, Lionblaze and Jayfeather realize that Hollyleaf never had a power in the first place. They instead turn their eyes to two kits newly born in the Clan, one of whom could fulfill the third role in the prophecy.|$|E

25|$|After much research, Houdini wrote a {{collection}} of articles {{on the history of}} magic, which were expanded into The Unmasking of Robert-Houdin published in 1908.

Many of the allegations in the book were dismissed by magicians and researchers who defended Robert-Houdin. Magician Jean Hugard would later write a full rebuttal to Houdini's book.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fifth}} book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the Ministry of Magic has been waging a smear {{campaign}} against Harry and Dumbledore, disputing their claims that Voldemort has returned. Harry {{is made to}} look like an attention-seeking <b>liar,</b> <b>and</b> Dumbledore a trouble-maker. A new character is introduced when the Ministry of Magic appoints Dolores Umbridge as the latest Hogwarts' Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor (and Ministry spy). Because the paranoid Ministry suspects that Dumbledore is building a wizard army to overthrow them, Umbridge refuses to teach students real defensive magic. She gradually gains more power, eventually ousting Dumbledore and seizing control of the school. As a result, Harry's increasingly angry and erratic behaviour nearly estranges him from Ron and Hermione.|$|E

25|$|Finding {{the barrio}} Capaya {{completely}} deserted, the platoon ganged-up on Duman who was brusquely interrogated regarding the Katupunero band that raided Bo. Capaya and {{the whereabouts of}} the entire barrio population. The poor Duman, knowing nothing of what transpired in his village as his field was quite far from the village, answered he knew nothing what the soldiers were talking about. Immediately, he was branded as a big <b>liar</b> <b>and</b> was quickly {{accused of being a}} Katipunero himself! The guards took turns in hitting him with their rifle butts on the head, chest and back to force him to talk, but Duman only wept in pain and insisted that he knew nothing. The soldiers continued to beat him up until nothing but blood came out of his mouth, nose and ears. Exasperated, the soldiers tied his elbows in miquit-a-sicu fashion, and with a long rope tied around his neck, the bloodied Duman was taken on foot to the town hall for further interrogation. Once inside the municipal jail, the guards mercilessly beat him up with solid bamboo clubs to extract revolutionary information to no avail. No food or water was given him.|$|E
