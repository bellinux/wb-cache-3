25|$|The Timberwolf {{action is}} a {{manually}} operated stainless steel bolt action with a right-hand side bolt and ejection port. The bolt is a rotary bolt with dual front locking lugs plus one <b>locking</b> <b>lug</b> at the rear. It requires a 90-degree bolt rotation. the bolt is partly helically fluted which reduces weight and stops bolt debris jams. A double plunger ejector and hook type extractor are used to remove fired cartridge cases. This helps create a very smooth action which is very reliable. The extra <b>locking</b> <b>lug</b> at the rear assists in preventing the bolt from becoming jammed when chambering another round.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{centerfire}} rifle cartridges, however, {{can generate}} pressures {{that may be}} too great for a single <b>locking</b> <b>lug,</b> {{if it is not}} stout enough. The Thompson Center Contender, for example, was limited to [...]30-30 Winchester level cartridges. To fire more powerful cartridges requires a much larger <b>locking</b> <b>lug,</b> such as that which Thomson Center used on the larger Encore model. By comparison, while bolt-action shotguns may only use a single <b>locking</b> <b>lug,</b> almost all bolt-action rifles use multiple locking lugs {{around the perimeter of the}} bolt to provide an even distribution of the forces of firing, giving a much higher intrinsic strength. Since many break open rifles, such as the inexpensive H&R models, are built on large frames originally meant for shotguns, the action is very heavily built and capable of handling moderate to high pressures. Still, belted magnum cartridges such as [...]300 Winchester Magnum are generally only found in the highest quality break action rifles.|$|E
5000|$|Versions of the Mauser action {{designed}} {{prior to}} the Gewehr 98's introduction, {{such as that of}} the Swedish Mauser rifles and carbines, lack the third <b>locking</b> <b>lug</b> and feature a [...] "cock on closing" [...] operation.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the {{previous}} Schmidt-Rubin series of rifles, the K31's <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> <b>lock</b> up immediately behind the chamber. This forward {{positioning of the}} <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> affords several advantages. The entire action is strengthened as the <b>lugs</b> <b>lock</b> into the much thicker forward part of the receiver. Lock-up is also more precise.|$|R
50|$|The <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> of K31 rifles {{can develop}} cracks {{that can be}} {{visually}} determined by the naked eye or {{with the help of}} a loupe. Rifles with substandard <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> should be immediately be redrawn from shooting and professionally repaired to prevent dangerous situations.|$|R
50|$|The CZ 550 system {{consists}} of a receiver {{that serves as the}} systems shroud and a bolt group of which the bolt body has three <b>locking</b> <b>lugs,</b> two large main lugs at the bolt head and the bolt handle serves as a backup in case the primary <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> failed. The bolt handle is permanently attached to the bolt and is turned-down and backwards for use with optical sights.|$|R
50|$|The four tyre changers, one at {{each corner}} of the car, have the sole {{responsibility}} of using a pneumatic wrench to remove the car's single <b>locking</b> <b>lug</b> nut from each tyre, then reinstall it on the new tyre.|$|E
50|$|The 1922M2 variant was {{introduced}} in 1933. This version featured a simplified bolt and a shallower pistol grip on the stock. All versions of the M1922 used {{what would be the}} safety lug on the 1903 bolt as the <b>locking</b> <b>lug.</b>|$|E
5000|$|It {{was only}} {{manufactured}} between 1908 and 1915, {{for a total}} of 15,376 revolvers, a stock that sold out completely by 1917. It was replaced by a [...]44 Hand Ejector 2nd Model, most visibly different in lacking the ejector shroud and third <b>locking</b> <b>lug.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Triaxial BNC connector. Newer {{variants}} {{have three}} <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> {{rather than the}} two used here to prevent accidental interconnection with regular BNC connectors.|$|R
50|$|The M 98 system {{consists}} of a receiver {{that serves as the}} systems shroud and a bolt group of which the bolt body has three <b>locking</b> <b>lugs,</b> two large main lugs at the bolt head and a third safety lug {{at the rear of the}} bolt which serves as a backup in case the primary <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> failed. This third lug is a distinctive feature and was not present on previous Mauser bolt action designs. The two main <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> display a <b>locking</b> surface of 56 mmÂ², whilst the third safety lug normally plays no part in locking the action to avoid asymmetric and hence unbalanced bolt thrust forces. The diameter of the receiver was also enlarged compared to previous Mauser receivers for additional strength and safety. The bolt handle is permanently attached to the bolt and on the Mauser M 98 series is turned-down for use with optical sights.|$|R
5000|$|The 760 {{featured}} a detachable box magazine, dual action bars, and a removable aluminum trigger group. The bolt featured 14 <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> {{laid out in}} an interrupted-thread pattern. These <b>lugs</b> <b>locked</b> into corresponding <b>lugs</b> in a barrel extension {{by means of a}} cam-rotated bolt. [...] This bolt arrangement was problematic and the interrupted thread lugs were replaced with more conventional lugs on the Model 7600 that replaced it.|$|R
5000|$|Its popular name {{refers to}} its extra (third) <b>locking</b> <b>lug</b> on the {{cylinder}} crane. This extra locking mechanism was deemed necessary {{due to the}} increased power of the [...]44 Special cartridge (a lengthened [...]44 Russian, and itself the parent of the [...]44 Magnum), first chambered in the Triple Lock.|$|E
50|$|Initial {{problems}} with this lug cracking drove further development of the M1922 resulting in the final M2 version. the main distinguishing change in the M2 variant was the incorporation of an adjustable headspace mechanism in the <b>locking</b> <b>lug.</b> This mechanism consisted of an Allen key screw that passed through the <b>locking</b> <b>lug</b> bearing against the right rear receiver wall. This headspace screw was locked in place, after adjustment, by a brass pin that bore against headspace screws' threads. the brass pin was not threaded but {{held in place by}} a lead plug. The lead plug shows a small eagle that was pressed into the plug by the special tool used by the armourer. If the eagle was disturbed the armourer would know that an attempt had been made to change the headspace by unauthorised personnel.|$|E

50|$|In 1997, Sako {{launched}} the M75, named for Sako's 75th anniversary. The 75 was externally similar to previous Sako models, but the construction was radically different featuring three symmetrical <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> and a detachable magazine.|$|R
50|$|Model 1907 and 1905/1910 Match Target Rifle These very {{important}} single-shot rifles (two rifles {{are known to}} exist) are bearing special feature {{that would make the}} M1910 so different; the threaded <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> and receiver.|$|R
5000|$|In {{manually}} operated firearms, such as bolt-action, lever-action, and pump-action rifles and shotguns, the bolt is held fixed by its <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> during firing, forcing all the expanding gas forward, and is manually withdrawn to chamber another round.|$|R
5000|$|In 1992, Winchester began {{producing}} a controlled round feed Model 70 that was marketed as the [...] "Classic" [...] model. This version reintroduced the CRF feature, while retaining the [...] "anti-bind" [...] <b>locking</b> <b>lug</b> groove bolt guide of the 1968 push feed model. The use of modern CNC manufacturing techniques allowed Winchester to re-introduce the CRF feature {{at a competitive}} price.|$|E
5000|$|The HK416 is {{equipped}} with a proprietary accessory rail forearm with MIL-STD-1913 rails on all four sides. This lets most current accessories for M4/M16-type weapons fit the HK416. The HK416 rail forearm can be installed and removed without tools by using the bolt <b>locking</b> <b>lug</b> as the screwdriver. The rail forearm is [...] "free-floating" [...] and does not contact the barrel, improving accuracy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{now well}} known Mauser [...] "wing" [...] type safety lever was {{developed}} for the Gewehr 71. The Gewehr 71 is a conventional looking bolt action chambered in 11mm using black powder cartridges. The action included only a bolt guide rib as its single <b>locking</b> <b>lug,</b> locking forward of the receiving bridge. The original design was a single-shot. The design was updated in 1884 with an 8-round tubular magazine designed by Alfred von Kropatschek, making this Germany's first repeating rifle. This version was designated the Gewehr 1871/84. A version of this repeater {{was adopted by the}} Ottoman Empire. Designated the M1887, it differentiated from the M71/84 in that it had a side mounted cleaning rod, a second <b>locking</b> <b>lug</b> on the rear of the bolt, and it was in caliber 9.5Ã60mmR, which Paul Mauser touted as the most efficient (black powder) cartridge.In the early 20th century a few were converted to 7.65Ã53mm smokeless by the arsenal in Ankara.|$|E
25|$|The Galil {{series of}} rifles are {{selective}} fire weapons {{operated by a}} Kalashnikov-pattern gas-driven piston system with no regulator. The weapon is locked with a rotary bolt with two <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> that <b>lock</b> into recesses milled into the receiver.|$|R
50|$|The RK 95 TP is a select-fire, gas-operated firearm {{using the}} Kalashnikov-pattern {{operating}} {{system with a}} long stroke gas piston rod coupled to the bolt carrier as in the AK rifle. The rotating bolt locks into battery via two <b>locking</b> <b>lugs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The A-Bolt rifle is a bolt-action rifle. It uses a {{non-rotating}} bolt sleeve (partial sleeve {{on first}} generation A-bolt rifles). When the bolt is unlocked, smoothness is achieved with three guide ribs aligned with three <b>locking</b> <b>lugs,</b> enabling precise movement (only {{on the second}} and third generation A-bolt rifles). These three <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> also greatly increase bolt strength. The bolt's smoothness is also increased with a unique cartridge depressor; the cartridge depressor stays in place independent of the bolt's position. Near the end of the reloading cycle, when the bolt is re-inserted, the bolt moves gently over the cartridges in the magazine. The barrel is free-floating and the recoil lug is glass bedded.|$|R
5000|$|These rifles, {{like other}} pre-M 98 system Mauser rifles, lack the third safety <b>locking</b> <b>lug</b> {{at the rear}} of the bolt and feature [...] "cock-on-closing" [...] (similar to the {{contemporary}} Lee-Enfield rifle) instead of the [...] "cock-on-opening" [...] style found on the German Gewehr 98 and most subsequent bolt-action rifles. The rear sight was graduated for 6.5Ã55mm service cartridges from 300 to 2000 m in 100 m increments.|$|E
5000|$|This was {{followed}} by the Model 1888 which was a top-eject action like the 1881 with several improvements, most important was the incorporation of a <b>locking</b> <b>lug</b> locking the breech. It was chambered in the WCF (Winchester centerfire) family of cartridges originally developed for the Winchester 1873 rifle: [...]44 WCF, [...]38 WCF, and [...]32 WCF (also known as the [...]44/40, [...]38/40, and [...]32/20). The Model 1889 that followed was the first lever-action rifle to have a solid top with side ejection of spent cartridges. This model was chambered for the same cartridges as the 1888. Design improvements to the Model 1889, such as a one-piece trigger and a two-piece firing pin to prevent the rifle from firing unless the finger lever was fully closed or if the <b>locking</b> <b>lug</b> were missing, resulted in the Model 1894. Additionally, the finger lever lock of the Model 1889 was eliminated on the Model 1894 and replaced by a latch built into the lever itself. This model was chambered in the same calibers with the addition of the [...]25/20 and later [...]218 Bee.|$|E
50|$|Break-open {{actions are}} also not as {{inherently}} strong as other action types, rendering them capable of withstanding only relatively low pressures. The action is usually held closed {{by a single}} <b>locking</b> <b>lug,</b> usually below the barrel in a single shot or between the barrels of a double barreled gun. The single lug must carry all of the force of firing the cartridge. For shotguns, which operate at very low pressures, {{this is not an}} issue.|$|E
5|$|The Model 1200 was {{the first}} shotgun to utilize a rotary bolt with four <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> secured within the barrel extension. The 1200 was Winchester's first shotgun to {{incorporate}} the company's patented Winchoke system, a quick change tube to allow the easy replacement of chokes.|$|R
50|$|It is {{essentially}} a scaled-down Model 1893 Mauser with two rear-mounted <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> and a Mauser-style two-position flip safety. The Destroyer fired the same ammunition as the standard-issue police handgun but used a 5-shot single stack magazine. The longer rifle barrel resulted in greater muzzle velocity, accuracy, and range.|$|R
2500|$|Behind {{the bolt}} carrier is a plastic or metal buffer, which rests {{in line with}} a return spring. The buffer spring begins to push the bolt carrier and bolt back toward the chamber once it is {{compressed}} sufficiently. A groove machined into the upper receiver guides the bolt cam pin and prevents it and the bolt from rotating into a closed position. The bolt's <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> push a fresh round from the magazine as the bolt moves forward. The round is guided by feed ramps into the chamber. As the bolt's <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> move past the barrel extension, the cam pin twists into a pocket milled into the upper receiver. This twisting action follows the groove cut into the carrier and forces the bolt to twist and [...] "lock" [...] into the barrel extension.|$|R
5000|$|The Gewehr 71 is a {{conventional}} looking bolt action single-shot rifle that uses black-powder cartridges. The action included only a bolt guide rib as its single <b>locking</b> <b>lug,</b> locking {{forward of the}} receiving bridge. The now well recognized Mauser [...] "wing" [...] type safety lever was developed for the Gewehr 71. The cartridge was a metallic 11 Ã 60R bottlenecked case, holding a charge of [...] of black powder, capped with a [...] round-tipped bullet.|$|E
5000|$|The Mauser M 98 bolt {{system was}} {{introduced}} in the Mauser Gewehr 98 and is the most common bolt-action system in the world, being in use in nearly all modern hunting rifles and the majority of military bolt-action rifles until the middle of the 20th century. The Mauser system is stronger than that of the Lee-Enfield due to two locking lugs just behind the bolt head which make it better able to handle higher pressure cartridges (i.e. [...] "Magnum" [...] calibre centrefire rifle cartridges). The 8Ã68mm S and 9.3Ã64mm Brenneke magnum rifle cartridge [...] "families" [...] were designed for the Mauser M 98 bolt action. A novel safety feature was the introduction of a third <b>locking</b> <b>lug</b> present {{at the rear of the}} bolt that normally did not lock the bolt, since it would introduce asymmetrical locking forces. The Mauser system features [...] "cock on opening", meaning the upward rotation of the bolt when the rifle is opened cocks the action. A drawback of the Mauser M 98 system is that it cannot be cheaply mass-produced very easily. Many Mauser M 98 inspired derivatives feature technical alterations, such as omitting the third safety <b>locking</b> <b>lug,</b> to simplify production.|$|E
50|$|The two tire changers {{remove the}} lug nuts and (if not {{done by the}} jackman) the old tire and tighten the lug nuts on the new tire. One tire changer is solely {{responsible}} for the front tires, while the other {{is responsible for the}} rears. NASCAR requires a wheel to have five traditional lug nuts, as opposed to the single <b>locking</b> <b>lug</b> nut seen in Formula One. Many jackmen watch the tire changers to make sure the lug nuts are tight.|$|E
2500|$|L59A1 Drill Rifles were {{rendered}} {{incapable of}} being fired, and of being restored to a fireable form, by extensive modifications {{that included the}} welding of the barrel to the receiver, modifications to the receiver that removed the supporting structures for the bolt's <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> and blocking the installation of an unaltered bolt, {{the removal of the}} striker's tip, the blocking of the striker's hole in the bolt head and the removal of most of the bolt body's <b>locking</b> <b>lugs.</b> Most bolts were copper plated for identification. A plug was welded in place forward of the chamber, and a window was cut {{in the side of the}} barrel. The stock and fore end was marked with broad white painted bands and the letters [...] "DP" [...] for easy identification.|$|R
5000|$|Behind {{the bolt}} carrier is a plastic or metal buffer, which rests {{in line with}} a return spring.

The bolt's <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> push a fresh round from the magazine as the bolt moves forward. The round is guided by feed ramps into the chamber. As the bolt's <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> move past the barrel extension, the cam pin twists into a pocket milled into the upper receiver. This twisting action follows the groove cut into the carrier and forces the bolt to twist and [...] "lock" [...] into the barrel extension.|$|R
50|$|The 9 Lug/Magnum {{action was}} the {{original}} design which went into production and was also the design which was subject to the strength testing conducted by Weatherby. The original 9 Lug design lacked the bolt fluting and featured a safety mounted on the receiver. These rifles were made by PFI and J.P. Sauer & Sohn in the early 1960s. The refinements to the original design included a fluted bolt and a redesigned safety allowing for smoother feeding and extraction and a safer design. The 9 Lug action is considered the archetypal Mark V action. The 9 Lug design features a bolt head with nine <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> arranged in three rows with each row having three <b>locking</b> <b>lugs.</b> The Magnum Mark V bolt is the heaviest bolt available in a commercially produced rifle.|$|R
