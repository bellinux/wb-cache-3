The first {{is home to a}} pair of pied tamarins with pygmy marmosets, and the second is shared by three emperor tamarins and three golden-headed <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins.</b> Azara's agoutis, Geoffrey's marmosets, black-tailed marmosets, black <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins,</b> Red Titi and white-faced sakis have also been housed here in the past but have been moved out for various reasons.|$|E
25|$|The {{forests that}} golden <b>lion</b> <b>{{tamarins}}</b> {{need in order}} to survive are cut down for timber and to make room for cattle ranches, farms and urbanization. Sometimes very small areas or 'pockets' of forest are left but these are too small for the tamarins to survive in. In the past, tamarins were collected for sale to the pet trade or for use in research laboratories. The golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> are located in the South American house.|$|E

25|$|Dublin Zoo's South American House is {{sponsored}} by Kellogg's Coco Pops, and houses various species from Central and South America, including golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins,</b> Goeldi's marmosets, two-toed sloths, squirrel monkeys, military macaws, white-faced saki monkeys, painted wood turtles and pygmy marmosets.|$|E
25|$|This tiny monkey, {{named for}} its {{beautiful}} golden colour and the long hair around its head which resembles a lion's mane, {{is one of the}} rarest primates in the world. Golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins,</b> like many of the other tamarins found in South America, are threatened with extinction in their natural habitat. Dublin Zoo is involved in the international breeding programme and helps to fund researchers who study the tamarins in Brazil.|$|E
25|$|Expanding {{knowledge}} about the needs of zoo animals and commitment to their well being has changed {{the look of the}} National Zoo. Today, animals live in natural groupings rather than individually. Rare and endangered species, such as golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins,</b> Sumatran tigers, and sarus cranes, breed and raise their young – showing the success of the zoo's conservation and research programs. The zoo's research team studies animals both in the wild and at the zoo. Its research encompasses reproductive biology, conservation biology, biodiversity monitoring, veterinary medicine, nutrition, behavior, ecology, and bird migration.|$|E

50|$|The black <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> (Leontopithecus chrysopygus), {{also known}} as the golden-rumped <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin,</b> is a <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> endemic to the Brazilian state of São Paulo, almost {{exclusively}} at the Morro do Diabo State Park. Its limited geographical range makes it the rarest of the New World monkeys, with little known about it. It was thought to be extinct for 65 years until its rediscovery in 1970.In 2016 an adult couple was found to the east, in the Caetetus Ecological Station, after six years with no sightings.|$|R

25|$|World of Birds, which {{originally}} {{opened in}} 1972, is an indoor bird house spanning two floors and featuring several walk-through aviaries. The building closed for repairs and upgrades {{in the summer}} of 2010, and reopened the following year. The exhibit has multiple educational displays focusing on deforestation and the illegal wildlife trade and their affects on wild bird populations. The most prominent residents of the exhibit include the maleos, a pair of Sanford's tarictic hornbills (Penelopides exarhatus sanfordi), green junglefowl, fawn-breasted bowerbirds, Cuban amazons, pink pigeons, Andean cocks-of-the-rock, plate-billed mountain toucans, Oriental pied hornbills, Abdim's storks, keas, three species of birds-of-paradise, a golden-headed quetzal, blue-billed curassows, white-throated bee-eaters, western capercaillies, white-fronted bee-eaters and common hoopoes. Emus can be found in an outdoor yard. Golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins,</b> Bolivian grey titis, cotton-top tamarins, and red-footed tortoise make up the exhibit's non-bird species. In mid-2009, the zoo's hand-reared pair of great blue turacos successfully raised chicks, the first known instance of a hand-reared pair doing so. In March 2013, three maleo chicks hatched at the zoo, bringing their total number of birds to 12. The zoo, along with the WCS, works towards preserving this species in the wild as well.|$|E

[...] Following in the {{footsteps}} of Spanish explorers, visitors enter the Americas through the south eastern United States, where alligators roam the swamps and wetlands. [...] The path continues to the Tropics Treehouse, home to golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins,</b> pygmy marmosets and cotton top tamarins. [...] The tropics precinct provided a new home for the zoo's American alligator, 26-year-old, Doris. [...] Doris was joined later that month by four new females, all eight years old, named Dakota, Dixie, Tallulah and Georgia. In November 2010, male golden lion tamarin, Janeiro, arrived from Adelaide Zoo as a companion for the zoo's female, Gabrielle.|$|E
50|$|The black-faced <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> or Superagüi <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> (Leontopithecus caissara) {{is a small}} New World monkey of {{the family}} Callitrichidae. It is {{critically}} endangered and endemic to coastal forests in southeastern Brazil. There are several conservation projects and the total populations is unlikely to exceed 400 individuals. It is overall golden-orange with contrasting black head, legs and tail.|$|R

50|$|The diet of {{the black}} <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> is {{seasonal}} and varies with the habitats it moves through. When the tamarin is in the dryland forest, it usually eats a variety of fruits, whereas in a swampy environment it predominantly feeds on the gum of various trees. In addition to seasonal variation, the black <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> exhibits daily and monthly cycles of food preferences.|$|R
50|$|Secondly, in {{an effort}} to save the golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> from extinction, some of the golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> have been removed from small, {{isolated}} unsafe forests and placed into a larger, protected forest; specifically they were moved to União Biological Reserve and Poço das Antas reserve. This effort to move the golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> into União Biological Reserve in Brazil began in 1991. The golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> faced the potential of getting new diseases that they had not been previously exposed to. Many were exposed to callitrichid hepatitis, and contracted the disease.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} home to 77 known species of mammals. Currently, the mammal {{population}} is threatened due to many reasons such as wildfires and poaching.The reserve {{is famous for its}} golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> (Leontopithecus rosalia), which represent most part of the few remaining wild golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> in the world. There is estimated to be 1000 tamarins in the reserve and surrounding areas. Currently the Golden Lion Tamarin Conservation Project (GLTCP) is attempting to save the golden <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> from extinction.|$|E
