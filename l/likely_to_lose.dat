5|$|Sodium atoms have 11 electrons, {{one more}} than the {{extremely}} stable configuration of the noble gas neon. Because of this and its low first ionization energy of 495.8 kJ/mol, the sodium atom is much more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> the last electron and acquire a positive charge than to gain one and acquire a negative charge. This process requires so little energy that sodium is readily oxidized by giving up its 11th electron. In contrast, the second ionization energy is very high (4562 kJ/mol), because the 10th electron {{is closer to the}} nucleus than the 11th electron. As a result, sodium usually forms ionic compounds involving the Na+ cation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Current {{understanding}} of the associations between actual body weight status, weight perception, body dissatisfaction, and weight control practices among low-income urban African American adolescents is limited. The knowledge can help direct future intervention efforts. Methods Cross-sectional data including measured weight and height and self-reported weight status collected from 448 adolescents in four Chicago Public Schools were used. Results The prevalence of overweight and obesity (BMI ≥ 85 th percentile) was 39. 8 %, but only 27. 2 % considered themselves as obese, although 43. 4 % reported trying <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight. Girls were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> express weight dissatisfaction than boys, especially those with BMI ≥ 95 th percentile (62. 9 % vs. 25. 9 %). BMI ≥ 85 th percentile girls were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight than boys (84. 6 % vs. 66. 7 %). Among all adolescents, 27. 2 % underestimated and 67. 2 % correctly judged their own weight status. Multinomial logistic models show that those with BMI ≥ 85 th percentile, self-perceived as obese, or expressed body dissatisfaction were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight; adjusted odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were 4. 52 (2. 53 – 8. 08), 18. 04 (7. 19 – 45. 30), 4. 12 (1. 64 – 10. 37), respectively. No {{significant differences were found}} in diet and physical activity between those trying <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight and those not trying, but boys who reported trying <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight still spent more television time (P Conclusion Gender differences in weight perception, body dissatisfaction, and weight control practices exist among African American adolescents. One-third did not appropriately classify their weight status. Weight perception and body dissatisfaction are correlates of weight control practices. Adolescents attempting <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight need be empowered to make adequate desirable behavioral changes. </p...|$|R
5|$|Teaching {{commitments}} left MacLaren {{unavailable for}} the start of the 1896 season, and his first appearance came in July. Although he had only batted once in the season, he was chosen to play in the second Test match of the summer between England and Australia, a selection made controversial by his lack of cricket. As the Test was played at Old Trafford, the England team was chosen by the Lancashire committee, who recognised that MacLaren would attract spectators as a local player. He was dismissed by the first ball he faced in the first innings, and scored 15 runs in the second as England were defeated. Shortly after the Test, he scored 226 against Kent to take Lancashire to a draw in a match they seemed <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose.</b> This was enough for him to retain his place in the team for the final Test match, where he scored 20 and 6. He batted effectively for the rest of the season, finishing with 713 runs for Lancashire at 54.85. Critics praised his batting, but his absences may have prevented the team from winning the Championship; they finished second. In all first-class matches, he scored 922 runs at 36.88.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose's height, and the {{accuracy}} {{with which he}} bowled, {{made it difficult for}} batsmen to play forward to the ball; instead they were forced to play with their weight going back. His accuracy meant that he was effective if the pitch favoured batsmen. He bowled an effective yorker, and unlike other fast bowlers, used short-pitched deliveries sparingly, although he could bowl a hostile bouncer, and concentrated on bowling a full length aimed at the wickets. Ambrose rarely engaged in verbal sparring with batsmen, although in later years he occasionally inspected the pitch in an area close to the batsman before an innings began and rubbed his hands to suggest that he would enjoy bowling there. He always aimed to concede as few runs as possible when bowling, and frequently berated himself when he offered an easy delivery from which to score. Following his dismissal of a batsman, Ambrose often celebrated by pumping the air with his fists. With Courtney Walsh, Ambrose developed a reputation for performing at his best when his team seemed <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose,</b> and he often took wickets in clusters which devastated the opposition. In addition, he was often most effective against the leading batsmen on a team; he was also capable of exploiting vulnerabilities in the techniques of other batsmen.|$|E

Approximately two-thirds of consumers in the United States and slightly over half of consumers in Italy indicated a desire <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight. Married consumers with children in the household in both countries are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> desire <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight. Furthermore, consumers from both countries who desire <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> agree that â€œthe main meal of the day is the most important time of the day for my household. â€ Although the main meal of the day is more important to consumers from both countries who desire <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight, consumers in the United States who desire <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> indicate that every member of their families eat the main meal together. Consumers in Italy who desire <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight were less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> indicate that every member of their families eat the main meal together. The self-described overweight consumers in both countries enjoy cooking and have sufficient food for their families. However, the overweight consumer in the United States is often too busy to cook. This research finds no difference in the number of meals eaten away from home in a typical week between those in each country who desire <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight and those who do not. Furthermore, in the United States the sources of foods eaten away from home, such as fast food, are not related to the importance to the consumer of weight loss.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Adolescence is {{a period}} of {{accelerated}} growth and change, bridging the complex transition from childhood to adulthood. This period offers adolescents an opportunity to begin planning for their futures and to adopt healthy attitudes about risk behaviors that can continue into adulthood, thus setting the stage for a lifetime of desirable health behaviors. This study used the Youth Risk Behavior Survey on middle school students and examined the gender differences of health risk behaviors among 674 8 th-graders from an urban setting. The results showed that males were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be involved in ®ghts, to initiate alcohol use, and to participate in physical activity; whereas females were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight with unhealthy practices, such as fasting and laxatives.

25|$|Terracotta {{feeding bottles}} {{surviving}} {{from the third}} millennium BC in Sumeria indicate that children who were not being breastfed were receiving animal milk, probably from cows.

Unless another lactating woman was available, a mother who lacked enough breast milk was <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> her child. To avert that possibility if a wet nurse was not available, an animal such as a donkey, cow, goat, sheep or dog could be employed. Suckling directly was preferable to milking an animal and giving the milk, as contamination by microbes during the milking process could lead to the infant contracting a deadly diarrheal disease. It was not until as late as the 1870s that stored animal milk became safe to drink due to the invention of pasteurisation and sterilisation.|$|E
25|$|Over time, Moroccan {{women have}} gained {{more access to}} employment. However, this {{quantitative}} increase in labor participation for women has not been accompanied by higher qualitative standards of labor. The labor of rural women in Morocco remain unacknowledged and unpaid. Women are put into {{a higher risk of}} poverty as their domestic workload is added onto their unpaid labor. This balance of domestic labor and work outside the home imposes a burden on rural women. Since the socioeconomic exclusion of women deprive them of the capabilities to be educated and trained for certain employment skills, their susceptibility to poverty is heightened. Low educational skills of women directly relate to the limited employment options they have in society. Although both men and women are affected by unemployment, women are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> their jobs than men.

40|$|For the {{prevention}} of falling in the elderly, gait training has been proposed using tasks such as the multi-target stepping task (MTST), in which participants step on assigned colored targets. This study presents a gait measurement system using a laser range sensor for the MTST to evaluate the risk of falling. The system tracks both legs and measures general walking parameters such as stride length and walking speed. Additionally, it judges whether the participant steps on the assigned colored targets and detects cross steps to evaluate cognitive function. However, situations in which one leg is hidden from the sensor or the legs are close occur and are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> lead <b>to</b> <b>losing</b> track of the legs or false tracking. To solve these problems, we propose a novel leg detection method with five observed leg patterns and global nearest neighbor-based data association with a variable validation region based {{on the state of}} each leg. In addition, methods to judge target steps and detect cross steps based on leg trajectory are proposed. From the experimental results with the elderly, it is confirmed that the proposed system can improve leg-tracking performance, judge target steps and detect cross steps with high accuracy...|$|R

25|$|In West Germany, {{the battle}} becomes {{a war of}} {{attrition}} that the Soviets expect to win through slow and sustained advances. The Soviets refuse to acknowledge NATO air superiority, and many West German towns are completely destroyed by artillery fire during the advance. A NATO air attack on the Soviet lines kills CINC-West (a Moscow favourite); Alekseyev's superior is assigned to replace him. Alekseyev becomes second-in-command of the attacking Soviet army group based in Stendal, and is angered to see the Soviet Army's failure to achieve a rapid victory, witnessing a failed advance towards the village of Bieben. He temporarily takes over command of a decapitated tank division and leads a successful attack on the town of Alfeld, finally giving the Red Army the breakthrough it needs. Eventually, Sergetov, after a meeting with his father, presents Alekseyev with documents that suggest that West Germany has been negotiating with the Soviets for a ceasefire under relatively favourable terms in neutral India, although he suspects {{it to be a}} trap.

40|$|The {{plunge in}} world oil prices has brought further {{difficulties}} to U. S. oil production, {{which has been}} declining in recent years. At the current low prices, most domestic oil wells are not profitable. This {{calls into question the}} long-run viability of oil production in the United States. Whether oil production remains a viable part of the U. S. economy in the next century will depend on how long oil prices remain at their current low levels. > Lamb and Wilkerson show how the recent low prices for oil on world markets reflect a combination of demand and supply effects, with both short-run and long-run forces at work. For example, sluggish demand growth reflects both milder weather {{in some parts of the}} world (a short-run phenomenon) and the impacts of the Asian financial crisis, which could persist for some time. Meanwhile, supply has mushroomed, in part due to the short-run effect of Iraq's return to higher levels of oil production. In the main, however, the increase in supply reflects sharp declines in the cost of discovering and extracting oil reserves. On balance, the current low prices appear to be mainly the result of longer run demand and supply forces, suggesting that prices are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> remain low for some time to come. If world oil prices do remain low, U. S. oil is unlikely to be competitive in world markets. Therefore, the domestic oil sector is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> market share for the foreseeable future. Petroleum industry and trade; Prices...|$|R
