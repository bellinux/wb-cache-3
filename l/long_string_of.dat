5|$|There was a <b>long</b> <b>string</b> <b>of</b> {{conflicts}} with Tibet over territories in the Tarim Basin between 670–692, and in 763 the Tibetans even captured {{the capital of}} China, Chang'an, for fifteen days during the An Shi Rebellion. In fact, {{it was during this}} rebellion that the Tang withdrew its western garrisons stationed in what is now Gansu and Qinghai, which the Tibetans then occupied along with the territory of what is now Xinjiang. Hostilities between the Tang and Tibet continued until they signed a formal peace treaty in 821. The terms of this treaty, including the fixed borders between the two countries, are recorded in a bilingual inscription on a stone pillar outside the Jokhang temple in Lhasa.|$|E
5|$|Moisture {{associated}} with Utor was partially blamed for heavy rains which produced extensive flooding in Peninsular Malaysia; these floods {{were the first}} in a <b>long</b> <b>string</b> <b>of</b> flood events that would plague the region until February2007. The tropical moisture acted in tandem with wind shear and a monsoonal flow to produce continuous precipitation over the Malaysian states of Pahang, Johor, and Malacca. Rainfall peaked at 567.8mm (22.35in) in Bandar Muadzam Shah over a four-day period, with similar rainfall totals occurring elsewhere. These floods were considered the worst in the history of southern Malaysia. The worst-affected areas were Segamat and Kota Tinggi, where both towns were inaccessible by land after all main roads leading to those towns were flooded. Eight fatalities resulted from the historical flooding.|$|E

In the spring of 670, Tibet attacked the remaining Chinese territories in the western Tarim Basin after winning the Battle of Dafeichuan against the Tang dynasty. With troops from Khotan they conquered Aksu, upon which the Chinese abandoned the region, ending two decades of Chinese control. They thus gained control over all of the Chinese Four Garrisons of Anxi in the Tarim Basin in 670 and held them until 692, when the Chinese finally managed to regain these territories.|$|E

25|$|García joined Magallanes {{during the}} 1949–1950 VPBL season {{in a game}} against the Cervecería Caracas club.

The young García went 2-for-4 against Carrasquel and recorded an RBI in the 5–2 victory over Caracas, quickly gaining the trust of Magallanes manager Lázaro Salazar, who gave him a place in the starting lineup as everyday third baseman.
