The Berg report generated criticism from some scholars of international development and African studies, particularly for the way it represents “the balance of responsibility for development failure.” The report prioritizes “domestic policy inadequacies” as a major cause for under-performing economies, and some have argued that the report downplays “the importance of external factors in shaping policy and performance in Sub-Saharan Africa.” In 1981, when the report was published, an important external factor was the instability of the global economy, particularly the stagflation of the 1970s, and the 1979 energy crisis.|$|E

Yet few systematic studies have been carried out to examine what determines these programs' loan repayment performance. We attempt to fill this gap by studying the determinants of loan repayment for four of the oldest group-based microcredit programs in the US. Our findings suggest that these programs are faced with a set of social and institutional environments that are both similar to and different from those faced by their third-world counterparts. On the one hand we find that higher levels of education and proximity to the <b>lending</b> <b>agency</b> increase the chances of loan repayment. Low transaction costs for accessing loans and high borrower-costs in the event of default also enhance loan repayment performance. On the other hand key variables such as gender and homogeneity of borrowers are not significantly related to loan repayment.

Systems theory formed the conceptual framework for the study. A purposive sample of 20 participants from Gwinnett County, Georgia completed semistructured interviews and described their personal experiences. Data analysis incorporated van Kaam 2 ̆ 7 s technique to code and cluster information into topics. The following themes emerged from the analysis indicating what these business leaders considered when they established subprime mortgage loans: (a) creditable subprime mortgage lending, (b) preferred subprime mortgage type, (c) length of the approval process, (d) pressures and limited options, and (e) the benefits of a subprime mortgage. The findings indicated these creditworthy subprime borrowers received better loans options. Findings also showed that subprime mortgage borrowers preferred fixed rate mortgages, creditworthiness determined the extent of their subprime process, the number of first time homebuyers increased, and mortgage borrowers with credit problems preferred subprime mortgage loans. The information from this study could assist mortgage borrowers looking for loan options and mortgage lenders looking to build stronger relationships with the borrowers and communities they serve.

40|$|As an {{official}} multilateral <b>lending</b> <b>agency,</b> the IMF has {{a daunting task}} to keep its finances in balance. Its mandate requires it to lend to countries in difficult financial straits after private sector lenders have pulled out and official bilateral lenders have become wary of the risks. In the 1990 s, the rapid growth and increasing complexity and instability {{of international trade and}} capital flows raised the stakes immensely. The value of world trade more than doubled from the 1980 s to the 1990 s. The aggregate current account deficit of all deficit countries rose from $ 223 billion a year in the 1980 s to $ 366 billion in the 1990 s. The size and volatility of international financial flows grew much more rapidly. In response, IMF credit outstanding rose from $ 28 billion to $ 41 billion. Despite the size of new lending, the Fund was covering a smaller portion of its members ’ financial needs. Raising the capital to keep this contribution from shrinking further provided a constant challenge throughout the decade. The Financial Evolution of the IMF The IMF began life in 1946 as a single fund: a pool of financial resources deposited by its member countries, mostly in the form of gold, U. S. dollars, and countries ’ own currencies. Those nondollar currency balances were {{a major part of the}} IMF’s assets, even though they were—at the time—not traded or convertible internationally and therefore not usable for IMF lending. Over time, the number of “usable currencies” gradually grew. The financial assets of what eventually became the General Depart-ment of the IMF comprised gold, usable currencies, and other currencies. The First Amendment of the Articles of Agreement, adopted in 1969, enabled the IMF to allocate (i. e., issue) special drawing rights (SDRs) through a separate SDR Department, which then had its own balance sheet. 1 Beginning in 1976, the IMF 1 The division of the IMF’s accounts into separate “departments ” (General and SDR) should not be confused with the organizational division into area and functional departments such as the African Department and the Fiscal Affairs Department.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this thesis is {{to contribute to the}} debate on the reasons behind Russia's poor economic performance in its first decade after the fall of communism, by examining the role of IMF economic programs in the reform process. In particular, we are interested in the failure of neo-classical models of the market economy, upon which economic reform programs were based, to predict the outcomes in Russia. The purpose of the work is to offer a number of theoretical models which incorporate certain characteristics, such as political and economic motivations of both the IMF and Russian government, large-scale public sector corruption, a substantial underground economy, and a weak tax base, and which are capable predicting the resulting failings in the IMF-Russia economic reform program. In chapter 2, we present a theory of conditionality in which the recipient, aware that the lender faces political and economic motivations in the conditional development lending process, undertakes a game with the lender in which the recipient attempts to undertake the least amount of compliance that guarantees it future loans. There is an exogenous conflict between economics and politics within the <b>lending</b> <b>agency</b> that determines its degree of tolerance for policy (non-) compliance. We then analyse how the donor, in an attempt to regulate its internal conflict, may adopt "rules of thumb" in the lending process which pre-define the actions it will take in response to the lender's level of compliance. The recipient's strategy depends on the payoffs it obtains from the actions available to the lender under each "rule of thumb". We examine how the IMF-Russia relationship from 1992 - 2002 has elements of the games we model. In chapter 3, we model corruption a proportional tax on labour income in a three-sector economy with a corrupt bureaucracy, a legitimate private sector, and a shadow economy, and examine how tighter fiscal policies may result in a rise in corruption. The rise in corruption negatively affects legitimate private sector employment and output. We suggest that the Russian economy has a similar three sector structure and analyse the impact of reduced spending and increased taxation on corruption and employment. In chapter 4, we modify Alesina and Tabellini's (1987) model of time inconsistency to allow for a weak tax base and then apply it to post-communist Russia. In particular we examine two non-consecutive time periods in which, for different reasons, public debt could not be used to finance the government's budget deficit: 1992 - 94 and post August 17 1998. We suggest that Russia did in fact move from one sub-optimal position to another, and we raise questions about the optimality of Russia's current monetary policies. In chapter 5, we examine the optimality of monetary policy in the presence of bureaucratic corruption. We model corruption as a proportional tax on firm revenue and a positive function of the official tax rate. The higher the official tax, the higher the corruption tax levied by public bureaucrats in order to supplement their decreasing official net wage, and the lower is output. We find that under both discretion and commitment, inflation is higher, and output and taxation are lower, than when there is no corruption...|$|E
