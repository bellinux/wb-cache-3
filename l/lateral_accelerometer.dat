50|$|One of {{the most}} common uses for MEMS accelerometers is in airbag {{deployment}} systems for modern automobiles. In this case the accelerometers are used to detect the rapid negative acceleration of the vehicle to determine when a collision has occurred and the severity of the collision. Another common automotive use is in electronic stability control systems, which use a <b>lateral</b> <b>accelerometer</b> to measure cornering forces. The widespread use of accelerometers in the automotive industry has pushed their cost down dramatically. Another automotive application is the monitoring of noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH), conditions that cause discomfort for drivers and passengers and may also be indicators of mechanical faults.|$|E

40|$|Summary. The {{yawing moment}} of inertia has been {{obtained}} by measuring the acceleration in yaw resulting from {{the release of a}} wing-tip parachute. <b>Lateral</b> <b>accelerometers</b> mounted near the fore and aft extremities of the aircraft on a line parallel to the principal axis of inertia were used to measure the yawing acceleration. The principal axis is known in this case from previous ground measurements, but it is shown that 1 degree error in axis inclination would only produce an error of about 3 per cent in the measured inertia. The results obtained from the flight tests are encouraging and are about 3 per cent lower than earlier measurements on a ground rig and about 2 per cent greater than the manufacturer's original estimate. Operational problems are discussed and some improvements to the parachute equipment are als...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Accurate {{detection}} {{of the danger}} of an impending rollover is necessary for active vehicle rollover prevention. A real-time rollover index is an indicator used for this purpose. A traditional rollover index utilizes lateral acceleration measurements and can detect only un-tripped rollovers that happen due to high lateral acceleration from a sharp turn. It fails to detect tripped rollovers that happen due to tripping from external inputs such as forces when a vehicle strikes a curb or a road bump. Therefore, this paper develops a new rollover index that can detect both tripped and un-tripped rollovers. The new rollover index utilizes vertical accelerometers in addition to a <b>lateral</b> <b>accelerometer</b> and is able to predict rollover in spite of unknown external inputs acting on the system. The accuracy of the developed rollover index is evaluated with experimental tests on a 1 / 8 th scaled vehicle. The experimental results show that the new rollover index can reliably detect both tripped and un-tripped rollovers. I...|$|E

This area aims to understand why drivers are distracted and how they adapt when distracted. Video data will be used assessing the situation {{in front of the}} driver as well as identifying safety-critical events. A close view of the driver face is needed to see the gaze direction and a view inside the vehicle to identify whether and which secondary tasks are performed. A smart camera measures the distance to potential crash objects and pedal positions, vehicle speed, longitudinal and <b>lateral</b> <b>accelerometers</b> will be used to identify driver reactions such as avoidance manoeuvres.

40|$|This master thesis {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of a car navigation system using <b>lateral</b> <b>accelerometers,</b> yaw rate and bearings relative three known radio beacons. Accelerometer, gyroscope and position data has been collected by an IMU combined with a GPS receiver, where the IMU was installed in the approximate motion center of a car. The bearing measurements are simulated using GPS data and the measurement noise model is derived from an experiment where the direction of arrival to one transmitter was estimated by an antenna array and the signal processing algorithm MUSIC. The measurements are fused in a multi-rate extended Kalman filter which assumes that all measurement noise is Gaussian distributed. This is not the case for the bearing measurement noise which contains outliers and therefore is modelled as a Gaussian uniform noise mixture. Different methods to deal with this have been investigated where the main focus is on the principle to use the Kalman filter’s innovation for each bearing measurement as an indication of its quality and discarding measurements with a quality above a certain threshold...|$|R

40|$|This project {{involved}} {{the development of}} a fault diagnostic system for Safetruck, an intelligent vehicle prototype. The fault diagnostic system continuously monitors the health of vehicle sensors, detects a failure when it happens, and identifies the source of the failure. The fault diagnostic system monitors several key components: the Global Positioning System, <b>lateral</b> <b>accelerometer,</b> and yaw-rate gyroscope, which constitute the set of lateral dynamic sensors, as well as the forward-looking radar that measures distance, relative velocity, and azimuth angle to other vehicles and objects on the highway. To design the project's lateral fault diagnostic system, researchers exploited the model-based dynamic relationships that exist between the three lateral sensors. They verified the system's performance through extensive experiments on the Safetruck. This project also explored a number of new approaches to creating a reliable fault detection system for radar. Monitoring the radar's health poses a special challenge because the radar measures the distance to another independent vehicle on the highway. In the absence of inter-vehicle communications, the fault diagnostic system has no way of knowing the other vehicle's motion, which means that model-based approaches cannot be used. Experimental results indicate that an inexpensive redundant sensor combined with a specially designed nonlinear filter would provide the most reliable method for radar health monitoring.

By using CMOS-MEMS technology, the micro sensors can be implemented with promising results. One of the central micro inertial sensors is an accelerometer which has the capability of sensing position change, vibration and shock of a device.

40|$|Cracking of {{cylindrical}} shafts is {{an important}} area for research, since the changes observed in their vibration characteristics even during large-sized cracking are much smaller than those observed for rectangular beams; hence early identification of crack existence becomes essential to prevent sudden failures in rotating shafts. In this paper experimental and numerical investigations are carried out to identify {{the presence of a}} crack in a cylindrical overhanging shaft with a propeller at the free end. In the experimental study, cracks of different depths are located at the (un-cracked) maximum bending moment position. Shaft response parameters for <b>lateral</b> (using an <b>accelerometer)</b> and torsional vibrations (using shear strain gages fixed at three different locations) are obtained using the modal analysis software, LMS Test Lab TM. The experimental results are used to validate the numerical results obtained using the three-dimensional isoperimetric elements available in the ANSYS FEM program; the open crack is embedded in the shaft and the mesh generation is suitably modified to incorporate the stress intensity effects present at the crack tip. The results indicate that the use of the rate of change of frequencies, modal amplitudes (of displacements, velocities and accelerations) as a function of crack depth ratio will indicate the presence of crack in the shaft from a crack depth ratio of 0. 2. Also the use of the rate of change of torsional frequency will indicate the presence of a crack in the shaft from the initiation of the crack. The approach indicated in this paper will provide a sound and robust procedure for a first level of damage assessment by using vibration techniques...|$|R
