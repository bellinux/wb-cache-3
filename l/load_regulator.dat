40|$|A {{method of}} on-line {{monitoring}} of the low-dropout voltage regulator's operation in a radiation environment is developed in this paper. The method had to enable detection of the circuit's degradation during exploitation, without terminating its operation in an ionizing radiation field. Moreover, it had to enable automatic measurement and data collection, {{as well as the}} detection of any considerable degradation, well before the monitored voltage regulator's malfunction. The principal parameters of the voltage regulator's operation that were monitored were the serial pnp transistor's base current and the forward emitter current gain. These parameters were procured indirectly, from the data on the voltage <b>regulator's</b> <b>load</b> and quiescent currents. Since the internal consumption current in moderately and heavily loaded devices was used, the quiescent current of a negligibly <b>loaded</b> voltage <b>regulator</b> of the same type served as a reference.

40|$|The main {{examined}} {{value in}} an experiment performed on moderately <b>loaded</b> voltage <b>regulators</b> was the serial pnp transistor’s minimum dropout voltage, followed by the data on the base current and forward emitter current gain. Minimum dropout voltage decreased by up to 12 %, while the measured values of the forward emitter current gain decreased by 20 - 40 % after the absorption of a total ionizing dose of 500 Gy. The oxide trapped charge increased the radiation tolerance of the serial lateral pnp transistor owing to the suppression of interface trap formation above the base area. Current flow through the serial transistor of the voltage regulator had an influence on the decrease in the power pnp transistor’s forward emitter current gain. Due to the operation with a moderate load of 100 mA, loss of emitter injection efficiency was {{not as important as}} during the operation with high current density, thus eliminating the negative influence of emitter crowding on the radiation hardness of the voltage regulator. For a moderate load, gain in the negative feedback reaction was enough to keep output voltage in the anticipated range. Only information procured from tests of the minimum dropout voltage on the moderately <b>loaded</b> voltage <b>regulators</b> were not sufficient for unequivocal determination of the examined integrated circuit’s radiation hardness.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{proposed}} and tested a new method for creating synthetic workloads. Our method takes the dynamic behaviour into consideration, whereas previous studies only consider the static behaviour. This {{was done by}} recording performance monitor counters (PMC) events from a reference application. These events were then {{used to calculate the}} hardware load characteristics, in our case cache miss ratios, that were stored for each sample and used as input to a <b>load</b> <b>regulator.</b> A signalling application was then used together with a <b>load</b> <b>regulator</b> and a cache miss generator to tune the hardware characteristics until they were {{similar to those of the}} reference application. For each sample, the final parameters from the <b>load</b> <b>regulator</b> were stored in order to be able to simulate it. By simulating all samples with the same sampling period with which they were recorded, the dynamic behaviour of the reference application could be simulated. Measurements show that this was successful for L 1 D$ miss ratio, but not for L 1 I$ miss ratio and only to a small extent for L 2 D$ miss ratio. We were also able to show that the total convergence time for the regulator could be reduced by using case-based reasoning to select the initial parameters from similar samples...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Queueing {{networks}} {{are used to}} model {{the performance of the}} Internet, of manufacturing and job-shop systems, supply chains, and other networked systems in transportation or emergency management. Composed of service stations where customers receive service, and then move to another service station till they leave the network, queueing {{networks are}} based on probabilistic assumptions concerning service times and customer movement that represent the variability of system workloads. Subject to restrictive assumptions regarding external arrivals, Markovian movement of customers, and service time distributions, such networks can be solved efficiently with “product form solutions” that reduce the need for software simulators requiring lengthy computations. G-networks generalise these models to include the effect of “signals” that re-route customer traffic, or negative customers that reject service requests, and also have a convenient product form solution. This paper extends G-networks by including a new type of signal, that we call an “Adder”, which probabilistically changes the queue length at the service center that it visits, acting as a <b>load</b> <b>regulator.</b> We show that this generalisation of G-networks has a product form solution...|$|E
