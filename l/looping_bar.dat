40|$|This paper {{shows the}} design, {{development}} and experimental checking of a modified type of structural joint with limited length between concrete segments cast “in-situ”. The design concept {{is based on}} the development length of an anchorage hook stiffened by transverse reinforcement bars and is particularly suited for the case of in-situ construction of staged box girder bridges, seeking to the possibility of using lighter scaffolding. The studies focusing on the strength, stiffness and serviceability of the proposed joint are presented. The research work comprises the bending behaviour of reinforced concrete slabs with loop joints with regard to the diameter of <b>loop</b> <b>bar,</b> <b>loop</b> joint width and ultimate and fatigue load. The results are compared to the behaviour of reinforced concrete slabs without joints. A total of 16 slabs were tested by static and fatigue loading tests. The present paper evaluates the flexural behaviour under static loading test. The results of fatigue tests have also shown an excellent performance. In the static tests, crack width and crack pattern were observed at service load levels, and the ultimate behaviour was evaluated by means of up to failure tests. From the test results, the service performance of the loop joints was confirmed similar to slabs without joints. The static loading tests confirm the good performance and effectiveness of this loop joint type under static loads. Details of loop joints design criteria are also suggested.

In {{order to}} reveal the motion center track of boring bar during {{heavy-duty}} deep-hole boring trepanning processing, a new model is proposed considering both linear item and cubic item to describe nonlinear factors of the bar’s stiffness. The study mainly investigates two factors: vortex instability caused by outside cutting fluid, and perturbation instability caused by inside cutting fluid of the boring bar. Vibration amplitude of the bar changes with the nonlinear stiffness coefficient while the bar works at the same rotation speed. The results of numerical calculation and simulation are obtained, when the processing parameters match the combinative operation parameters under the different motion status. It shows the bar interaction with external cutting fluid while it is subjected to unbalanced force. These behaviors will induce self-exited vibration of bar, meanwhile the center track will be a closed curve <b>loop.</b> Boring <b>bar’s</b> vibration is always in a certain vibration amplitude.

40|$|Today’s design teams deliver {{engineering}} models sophisticated {{enough to}} serve as blueprints for production and construction work. However, issues of adoption persist for the on-site use of building information modelling (BIM). It is known how delivery and placement of material such as reinforcing bars influences the productivity of the overall construction process. This article presents an early pilot case of BIM implementation for facilitating on-site placement of reinforcing bars. No traditional shop drawings were used throughout the fabrication and placement of the reinforcing bars. The research question asked is: Will BIM technology be accepted or rejected by concrete reinforcement ironworkers in carrying out their work? This question was considered worthwhile since whether or not individuals accept or resist using a new technology depends on whether they perceive it as beneficial or detrimental for doing their jobs. The technology acceptance model was used to structure the inquiry in this article. Data were collected based {{on a series of}} semi-structured interviews with reinforcement workers in Oslo’s new airport terminal T 2 project. The workers used a highly sophisticated virtual model indicating the position, type and dimension of reinforcement <b>loops</b> and <b>bars.</b> Findings are that even less IT-literate workers perceived the virtual models to provide them with a large relative advantage over paper workshop drawings. Thus, BIM systems, handheld devices, and apps can be considered sophisticated enough for replacing workshop drawings. A prerequisite is careful preparation work by structural and site engineers. Several issues hindering a more wide spread adoption could be identified: (1) information technology capability of structural engineers; (2) appropriate contracts, and (3) additional workload incurred by structural and site engineers. Our work indicates that substantial building process productivity improvements are possible when BIM adoption in reinforcing bar placement is introduced. However, there are costs which may outweigh some of the advantages. It was beyond the scope of our study to establish the added value of BIM for the reinforcement and the overall construction process...|$|R
50|$|The flat racing saddle is {{designed}} to not interfere with a running horse and to be as lightweight as possible (including the stirrup irons). The racing saddle has a very long seat without a dip to it, combined with extremely forward flaps that accommodate the very short stirrups and extreme forward seat used by jockeys. It also has a flat pommel and cantle so nothing interferes with the rider. Flat-racing saddles are built on a half-tree to reduce weight; because the rider spends {{most of the time}} up over the horse's withers, {{there is no need for}} the protection to the horse's spine that a full tree provides. The stirrups, instead of being <b>looped</b> over stirrup <b>bars,</b> are generally <b>looped</b> directly over the wooden bars of the half tree to prevent the loss of a stirrup during a race and to reduce bulk. This saddle provides very little security, placing the rider in a position that allows a horse the freedom of movement needed to achieve maximum speed, but at the cost of giving the rider less leverage to control the horse, and less protection for the horse's back from a sitting rider. Therefore, racing saddles are not suited for general equestrian riding.|$|R
40|$|The {{parametric}} quantification of geological {{bodies from}} high-resolution seismic data helps {{to understand and}} predict their occurrences, but is often hampered by layer distortions caused by postdepositional processes. A method called GeoTime cube overcomes this by creating a seismic volume between two time-equivalent geological markers in which the vertical axis corresponds approximately to relative geologic time. This volume is no longer affected by post-depositional deformations, a feature that greatly facilitates the extraction and correct parameterisation of sedimentary bodies. A case study of a fluvio-estuarine reservoir from Suriname (Guyana coast, South America) has demonstrated how to successfully extract fluvial point bars, channel fills, and crevasse splays from the GeoTime cube. The goal of this work is to quantitatively describe these objects with a minimum number of parameters thereby using recent analogues to validate the approach. The most basic element to parameterise is the channel path, which is described with a cubic spline. The paths of the meandering rivers studied are found to show characteristic patterns, notably a relatively constant curvature of each meander loop, and a characteristic spacing of the meander loops. The main depositional products of these meandering rivers are point bars, which are caused by lateral accretion of sand on the inner banks of the evolving meander <b>loops.</b> The point <b>bar</b> shape can be approximated b...|$|R
40|$|ASAP 1 is an Arf GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that {{functions}} on membrane surfaces {{to catalyze}} the hydrolysis of GTP bound to Arf. ASAP 1 contains a tandem of BAR, pleckstrin homology (PH), and Arf GAP domains {{and contributes to}} the formation of invadopodia and podosomes. The PH domain interacts with the catalytic domain influencing both the catalytic and Michaelis constants. Tandem BAR-PH domains have been found to fold into a functional unit. The results of sedimentation velocity studies were consistent with predictions from homology models in which the BAR and PH domains of ASAP 1 fold together. We set out to test the hypothesis that the BAR domain of ASAP 1 affects GAP activity by interacting with the PH and/or Arf GAP domains. Recombinant proteins composed of the BAR, PH, Arf GAP, and Ankyrin repeat domains (called BAR-PZA) and the PH, Arf GAP, and Ankyrin repeat domains (PZA) were compared. Catalytic power for the two proteins was determined using large unilamellar vesicles as a reaction surface. The catalytic power of PZA was greater than that of BAR-PZA. The effect of the BAR domain was dependent on the N-terminal <b>loop</b> of the <b>BAR</b> domain and was not the consequence of differential membrane association or changes in large unilamellar vesicle curvature.

40|$|Outline This was {{my first}} solo {{performance}} using spatial music technologies. The system I am using is the sixth generation realisation of a hemispherical speaker system, first designed by Perry Cook and Dan Trueman at Princeton University in 1997. Analysis This piece is {{three and a half}} minutes in duration and uses a very pared-back aesthetic, the simplicity of approach in this piece is influenced by the Gagaku tradition, which is directly referred to timbrally. [1] Dutch composer Ton De Leeuw, who carried out ethnomusicological work in Japan during the 1960 s was one of many western musicians who were inspired by the shō in Gagaku music:[2] In order to represent some of the soundworld and atmosphere of Gagaku (continuous drones, chord clusters, slow tempo, repetition) I used three processes: looping, harmonizer and reverb. Unusually, in this current research practice, once these loop, harmonizer and reverb settings are selected, I did not change, nor use any additional, DSP settings. Underpinning the piece is a continuous loop. This was created in the performance by sampling a short section of a clarinet drone which also contained a note simultaneously sung a perfect fifth above the clarinet. This sample was then pitched an octave lower. This loop is also sent through a band-pass filter which serves to accentuate mid-frequency details. The loop has a drone quality (in the sense that it establishes a tonal centre) as well as much timbral detail. It also contains complex rhythmic qualities: on a macro level it can be heard as a one <b>bar</b> <b>loop</b> in 7 / 4 at approximately 110 bpm, however other poly-rhythms disguise this structure, yielding a satisfyingly ambiguous rhythmic feel suitable for a figure, which is maintained for over three minutes. [1] Gagaku is “The traditional court music of medieval Japan, originally derived from China… The style is smooth and precise; the tempo is initially slow but later fast. ” See Oxford Grove Music Encyclopedia. [2] The shō is a mouth organ from the same family as the khaen (Thailand) and the sheng (China). The sheng was the precursor to the development of reed organs, the harmonium and the accordion. See Jeremy Montagu, Origins and Development of Musical Instruments (Lanham: Scarecrow Press, 2007), 95 - 97. The shō has been featured in the work of contemporary composers such as Toshi Ichiyanagi, Toru Takemitsu and John Cage.
