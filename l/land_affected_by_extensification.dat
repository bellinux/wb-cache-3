In addition, naturally halotolerant plants or microorganisms could be developed into useful agricultural crops or fermentation organisms.|$|R

50|$|Urbanization {{has indeed}} had a {{profound}} effect on the environment, on both local and global scales. Difficulties in actively constructing habitat corridor and returning biogeochemical cycles to normal raise the question as to whether such goals are feasible. However, some groups are working to return areas of <b>land</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> the urban landscape to a more natural state. This includes using landscape architecture to model natural systems and restore rivers to pre-urban states.|$|R

40|$|The {{cause of}} dryland {{salinity}} {{and the impact}} on the environment and agricultural productivity of agricultural land is well documented. A significant proportion of agricultural land in Australia is degraded as a result of dryland salinity and the land at risk of degradation from rising water tables is even greater. Much of the area of <b>land</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> salinity cannot be reclaimed profitably and may have adverse consequences for neighbouring properties, reserves and waterways. Introducing production systems that are adapted to waterlogged and saline soils {{is likely to be the}} only feasible management option for these areas. Only salt land pasture is likely to be profitable at the scale required to provide a management option for the majority of <b>land</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> salinity. The Sustainable Grazing for Saline Land (SGSL) initiative was developed with a number of partner organisations throughout southern Australia to identify and promote profitable grazing systems on otherwise unproductive land. Six key issues were identified and research was conducted across five sites in the four southern mainland states of Australia. The broad issues researched were: salt and water movement, pasture performance, animal performance, biodiversity, additional pasture species and systems economics.

30|$|Mining {{produces}} {{materials that}} are essential to human needs. Reclamation of <b>land</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> mining to a useful and productive state is also essential to meeting those needs. Effective reclamation of land {{is important to the}} long-term success and profitability of the mining business and to the future economic well-being of the landowner (ACSMP 2011). The federal law governing coal surface mining in the USA requires reclamation to achieve a post-mining land use potential that is equal to or better than the pre-mining capability. Laws governing mining in other nations have similar requirements.|$|R

40|$|This review {{deals with}} the {{establishment}} of wetlands on <b>land</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> mining, but it is useful to recall that the mining industry may have an impact in a number of ways, including direct impacts on existing wetlands, for example, physical obliteration, altered groundwater contours, heavy metal contamination, and eutrophication (nutrient enrichment and its consequences). Our emphasis is not so much on these impacts, or on techniques to rehabilitate wetlands after such disturbance, but on creating wetlands as a form of rehabilitation of mined lands rather than returning them to agricultural or forest production. However, some of these impacts leave a heritage that {{must be taken into account}} when attempting to create wetlands in a landscape <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> mining...|$|R

APCEC Regulation 15, the Arkansas Open Cut Mining and Land Reclamation (Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission, 2012c), set performance standards that must be followed during mining and the process of reclaiming land to a beneficial use.

5000|$|Some people {{strongly}} believe that dry toilets (and [...] "dry sanitation") {{are the more}} sustainable way for sanitation, whereas others argue that a generalisation is not possible and all the different sanitation systems have their place for all the different contexts. Dry toiletsâ€”or [...] "dry sanitation systems"â€”can lead to reduced water consumption, the recovery of valuable resources from domestic wastewater, reduced eutrophication, and reduced toxicity of agricultural soils. They therefore offer potential benefits in areas with low water availability, limited access to synthetic fertilizers, surface water bodies impacted by eutrophication, and agricultural <b>lands</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> heavy metals. However, these advantages need to be evaluated for each case and weighed against the potential disadvantages related {{to the loss of}} economy of scale.|$|R
