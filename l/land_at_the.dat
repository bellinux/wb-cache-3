5|$|Brean Down Fort {{was built}} on the {{headland}} between 1864 and 1871 on the recommendations of the 1859 Royal Commission. It was the most southerly of a chain of defences across the Bristol Channel, protecting the access to Bristol and Cardiff. Four acres of <b>land</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of Brean Down were requisitioned in 1862, with construction beginning in 1864 and completed in 1871.|$|E
5|$|Commander of the {{artillery}} Henry Knox persuaded Washington to transfer 400 to 500 soldiers, who lacked muskets or guns, to crew {{the artillery}}. In early June, Knox and Greene inspected the <b>land</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{north end of}} Manhattan and decided to establish Fort Washington. Fort Constitution, later renamed Fort Lee, was planned opposite Fort Washington on the Hudson River. The forts were hoped to discourage the British ships from sailing up the Hudson River.|$|E
5|$|From 1961 to 1968, UM leased {{buildings}} on its South Campus {{to serve as}} the covert headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency's JMWAVE operation against Fidel Castro's government in Cuba. In 1968, after Ramparts magazine exposed CIA operations on other campuses, JMWAVE was moved off the UM campus out of concern for embarrassing the university. The University no longer owns <b>land</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> south campus.|$|E

5|$|In 1921, Reynolds {{rented a}} large plot of <b>land</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> corner of Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street with the {{intention}} of building a tall building on the site. After several years of delays, Reynolds hired the architect William van Alen in 1927 to build a forty-story building on the plot.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Parachute Brigade (Brigadier James Hill) {{began to}} <b>land</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{same time as}} the main {{elements}} of 5th Parachute Brigade, and suffered from the same problems.

5|$|The {{precursor}} to Hurricane Donna brought severe weather to the Dakar area of Senegal. Air France Flight AF343, which was flying from Paris, France to Abidjan, Ivory Coast, attempted to <b>land</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Léopold Sédar Senghor International Airport as a layover. However, due to squally weather, the plane instead {{crashed into the}} Atlantic Ocean, killing all 63people on board. Heavy rainfall was also reported in Cape Verde on August30.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Pola, Tegetthoff kept his fleet {{in the northern}} Adriatic, where it patrolled against a possible Italian attack. The Italian ships never came, and on 12 August, the two countries signed the Armistice of Cormons; this ended the fighting {{and led to the}} Treaty of Vienna. Though Austria had defeated Italy at Lissa and on <b>land</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Custoza, the Austrian army was decisively defeated by Prussia at the Battle of Königgrätz. As a result, Austria, which became Austria-Hungary in the Ausgleich of 1867, was forced to cede the city of Venice to Italy. In {{the immediate aftermath of the}} war, the bulk of the Austrian fleet was decommissioned and disarmed.|$|E

5|$|During December 1796 {{and early}} January 1797, the French army {{repeatedly}} attempted {{to land in}} Ireland. Early in the voyage, the frigate Fraternité carrying de Galles and Hoche, was separated from the fleet and missed the rendezvous at Mizen Head. Admiral Bouvet and General Grouchy decided to attempt the landing at Bantry Bay without their commanders, but severe weather made any landing impossible. For {{more than a week}} the fleet waited for a break in the storm, until Bouvet abandoned the invasion on 29December and, after a brief and unsuccessful effort to <b>land</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mouth of the River Shannon, ordered his scattered ships to return to Brest. During the operation and subsequent retreat a further 11ships were wrecked or captured, with the loss of thousands of soldiers and sailors.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Vergas, Ibrahim {{decided to}} attack the Maniots from the rear. His plan was to send a small fleet with a few {{soldiers}} to <b>land</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Bay of Diros, 2 kilometers south of Areopolis. The aim of this was to capture the unguarded Areopoli, which cut the communication lines of the defenders at Vergas and demoralize them as well. He would then be able {{to attack the}} Maniots from the rear and control the mountain passes to eastern Mani and Gytheio. Authors Peter Greenhalgh and Edward Eliopoulos describe this plan as excellent.|$|E
5|$|Exactly 33 years later, on December 8, 2005, Southwest Airlines Flight 1248, a Boeing 737-700 inbound from Baltimore-Washington International Airport in Baltimore, Maryland, {{slid off}} the runway while {{attempting}} to <b>land</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> airport in a heavy snow storm. The airplane broke through the barrier fence of the airport, and came to rest {{at the intersection of}} 55th Street and Central Avenue bordering the airport at its northwest corner.

5|$|Following the United States gaining {{independence}} {{after their}} American Revolutionary War, in 1784, about 10,000 United Empire Loyalists settled in Upper Canada (what is now southern Ontario), chiefly in Niagara, around the Bay of Quinte, {{and along the}} St. Lawrence River between Lake Ontario and Montreal. The Crown granted them land in these areas {{in order to develop}} Upper Canada and to compensate them for losses in the United States. With former First Nations lands available for purchase, these new settlers were soon followed by many more Americans, attracted by the availability of inexpensive, arable <b>land.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, large numbers of Iroquois who had been allied with Britain arrived from the United States and were settled on reserves west of Lake Ontario as compensation for lands they lost in what was now the United States.|$|E
5|$|In 1824 Mary Ann Channer Davis, who {{had moved}} to St. Augustine {{with her husband in}} 1821, bought the Fornells claim to Key Biscayne from one of the Fornells' heirs for US$100. Mary and her husband William Davis, a deputy U.S. Marshal, {{probably}} were aware of plans to build a lighthouse on the Florida coast somewhere between St. Augustine and Key West, and knew that Key Biscayne was a likely location for it. Mary and William sold three acres (about one-and-a-quarter hectares) of their newly acquired <b>land</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> southern tip of the island (Cape Florida) to the U.S. government for US$225. The federal government built the Cape Florida lighthouse on that land in 1825.|$|E
5|$|In 1851, a large party led by Luther Collins made a {{location}} on <b>land</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{mouth of the}} Duwamish River; they formally claimed it on September 14, 1851. Thirteen days later, members of the Collins Party {{on the way to}} their claim passed three scouts of the Denny Party. Members of the Denny Party claimed land on Alki Point on September 28, 1851. The rest of the Denny Party set sail from Portland, Oregon, and landed on Alki point during a rainstorm on November 13, 1851.|$|E

5|$|In the Battle of Britain, Mayer often {{flew over}} the English Channel as the wingman of Helmut Wick. He claimed three further {{victories}} in this campaign, all over Royal Air Force (RAF) Supermarine Spitfires, but was himself shot down or forced to <b>land</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> French Coast. Once he had to swim in the Channel for an hour before he was rescued. At the end of 1940 Mayer had four victories to his credit and JG2 was withdrawn from combat to replenish the heavy losses it had sustained. Following a short tour as fighter pilot instructor at the Jagdfliegerschule (fighter pilot school) in Werneuchen, Mayer {{was sent back to}} the Channel Front.|$|E
5|$|Initial plans {{called for}} the United States Air Force to {{dispatch}} two transport aircraft to Mogadishu International Airport, but diplomats were unable to contact anyone in the Somali government to obtain clearance for the aircraft to <b>land</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> airport and it also became {{clear that it was}} too dangerous to travel from the embassy to the airport. Meanwhile, the USS Guam and USS Trenton began transit from the coast of Oman towards Mogadishu with forces from the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade.|$|E
