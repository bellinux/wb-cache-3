5|$|The Dorniers were {{devoid of}} German equipment, {{including}} engines. The Yugoslavs found a French manufacturer {{to supply the}} powerplants instead. Gnome et Rhône was the supplier chosen, and the Gnome-Rhône Mistral Major engine was {{to be used in}} the Dornier. The French had inflated the performance data of the engine, claiming it to have 649kW (870hp) and a speed of 420km/h (261mph) at 3,850m (12,320ft). The constant-speed propellers were also poor, and delivered <b>late.</b> <b>This</b> led to trials with Piaggio Aero and Ratier propellers.|$|E

25|$|Although the molad of Tishrei is {{the only}} molad moment that is not ritually announced, it is {{actually}} {{the only one that}} is relevant to the Hebrew calendar, for it determines the provisional date of Rosh Hashanah, subject to the Rosh Hashanah postponement rules. The other monthly molad moments are announced for mystical reasons. With the moladot on average almost 100 minutes <b>late,</b> <b>this</b> means that the molad of Tishrei lands one day later than it ought to in (100 minutes) ÷ (1440 minutes per day) = 5 of 72 years or nearly 7% of years.|$|E

25|$|As CMP, Collins's {{training}} was {{completely different from}} that for the LM and lunar EVA and was sometimes done without Armstrong or Aldrin being present. Along with simulators, there were size measurements for pressure suits, centrifuge training to simulate the 10 g reentry, and practicing docking with a huge rig at NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia, {{just to name a}} few. Since he would be the active participant in the rendezvous with the LM, Collins compiled a book of 18 different rendezvous schemes for different scenarios including where the LM did not land, or launched too early or too <b>late.</b> <b>This</b> book ran for 117 pages.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} {{was handled}} via the United States foreign military sales program, {{which in turn}} contracted McDonnell Douglas. Costs for the conversion were initially estimated at $89.5million (FY 1994). The aircraft was to be equipped with both a boom and a probe and drogue system. However, because McDonnell Douglas {{did not have any}} experience with the requested Remote Aerial Refueling Operator (RARO) system, and because the third aircraft differed from the original two, the program could not be completed at budget. By omitting the probe and drogue system and a fixed partition wall between the cargo and passenger, the cost could be limited at $96million. To make up for the cost increase McDonnell Douglas hired Dutch companies to do part of the work. The actual converting of the aircraft was done by KLM. Conversion of the aircraft was done from October 1994 to September 1995 for the first aircraft and from February to December 1995 for the second. This was much longer than planned, mostly because McDonnell Douglas delivered the parts <b>late.</b> <b>This</b> would have again increased the cost, but in the contract for the AH-64 Apaches which the Royal Netherlands Air Force also bought from McDonnell Douglas, the price was agreed to be kept at $96million.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the period, the Ostoja families in Lithuania and Poland avoided engagement in this political chaos. The king was appointing those that supported his own ambitions, which was {{the beginning}} of some new great fortunes. This political disaster ended in Partitions of Poland, 1772 when Prussia, Austria and Russia decided to divide defenseless Commonwealth between them. Poniatowski's reign until 1795 became the darkest chapter in Polish history. The Constitution of May 3, 1791 came far too <b>late.</b> <b>This</b> {{was the first time that}} the Commonwealth included Ruthenians and not just Poland and Lithuania. New Commonwealth was to be formed of three nations. Also this intention came far too late. However, the Constitution of May 3 united families that wanted to make necessary changes and that would serve the nation. In this movement we suddenly see lot of activity from the Ostoja families. Almost all of them supported the movement and in many cases all members of the family joined, women and men. In the first half of the century, the Ostoja families hold many offices and was still prospecting. In the second half of the century, they clearly turned into military commanders and supporters of the resistance, leading Confederations and armies against foreign forces and specially against Russia.|$|E

500|$|On 24 April 1976, McCartney and Lennon were {{watching}} {{an episode of}} Saturday Night Live together at Lennon's home in the Dakota, when Lorne Michaels made a $3,000 cash offer for the Beatles to reunite. While they seriously considered going to the SNL studio a few blocks away, they decided it was too <b>late.</b> <b>This</b> was their last time together. VH1 fictionalised this event in the 2000 television film Two of Us. McCartney's last telephone call to Lennon, days before Lennon and Ono released Double Fantasy, was friendly; he said this about the call: [...] " [...] a consoling factor for me, because I do feel it was sad that we never actually sat down and straightened our differences out.

500|$|Inside Thessalonica, {{the siege}} led to much suffering, and the populace quickly became {{dissatisfied}} with their new masters. By the winter of 1426–1427, conditions in the besieged city approached the point of famine. The Thessalonians were forced to subsist on bread alone, and even that proved problematic—the authorities were forced to request more shipments of wheat from Venice when supplies ran dangerously low. The conditions of [...] "extreme poverty, death, and destitution" [...] made the Greek population more and more restless, and even those who had formerly welcomed the Venetians began to waver. The lack of food even jeopardised the city's defences, {{since many of the}} mercenary guards on the walls, paid by Venice with wheat instead of cash, defected to the Turks when their rations were <b>late.</b> <b>This</b> situation became progressively worse, and {{by the time of the}} final Ottoman attack in 1430, many soldiers had no weapons because they had sold them for food.|$|E

500|$|Much of the {{criticism}} towards the Avatar spoof [...] "In the Na'Vi" [...] goes towards {{the timing of the}} episode. Surette thought that it was [...] "n Avatar spoof that came about two years too <b>late.</b> <b>This</b> sketch had no redeeming qualities and should be erased from the minds of all Simpsons fans immediately." [...] Similarly, Marnell commented that in the episode [...] "The Simpsons' finally gets around to parodying 'Avatar' — a movie picked to death by 'South Park' and other series a year or two ago" [...] and further elaborated that [...] "t's almost a straight forward retelling of 'Avatar' without the biting satire that made the film parodies of previous years so much fun." [...] In general, Treehouse of Horror episodes take about a year to complete for the staff. This is because they have to do many original designs, such as characters and backgrounds. Prior to the airing of the episode, Jean revealed that the staff was already working on [...] "Treehouse of Horror XXIII".|$|E
500|$|The protagonists in Argento's giallo films {{almost always}} suffer from vision {{impairment}} of some kind. It is these characters' chronic inability {{to find the}} missing pieces of a puzzle the puzzle being the solution of a murder or series of murders) that generally provides much of the films' narrative thrust. [...] Most obviously is the blind Franco Arno (Karl Malden) in The Cat o' Nine Tails, who must use his heightened aural sense in combination with visual clues supplied {{to him by his}} niece to solve a mystery. [...] In The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, Sam Dalmas (Tony Musante) witnesses a murder attempt but admits to the police that something seems to be [...] "missing"; as the film's surprise ending makes clear, he did not [...] "miss" [...] anything, but simply misinterpreted what happened in front of his eyes. In Deep Red, Marcus (David Hemmings) has a similar problem in both seeing and not seeing the murderer {{at the scene of the}} crime, and does not realize his mistake until it is almost too <b>late.</b> <b>This</b> recurring theme, according to Douglas E.

500|$|At 10:00 on 27 May 1909, {{loaded with}} over 1,000passengers headed for Europe, Princess Alice {{departed}} the Lloyd pier in Hoboken, New Jersey. As she neared The Narrows {{in a heavy}} fog, she steamed to stay clear of outbound French Line steamer [...] and ran hard aground on a submerged rocky ledge near the seawall of Fort Wadsworth {{a few minutes after}} 11:00. After the fog lifted, it was revealed that the bow of Princess Alice had stopped some [...] from the outer walls of the Staten Island fort. Lighthouse tender Larkspur was the first ship to {{come to the aid of}} the Princess, followed by U.S. Army Quartermaster's ship General Meigs and revenue cutter Seneca. No passengers were hurt in the incident and it was determined there was no damage to the hull of the liner. But, despite the effort of attending ships, she remained stuck on the ledge. Eventually, after offloading [...] of cargo from her front hold onto lighters called to the scene, ten steam tugs and power from Princess Alices own engines freed the ship at 01:47 on 28May, almost 15hours after running aground. The force required to free the liner was great enough that she was then propelled into SSMarken, at anchor some distance away, damaging one of that ship's fenders. After then making her way to the nearby New York City Quarantine Station, Princess Alice anchored to reload her cargo, and by 09:05, she was underway again. However, she ran aground again in soft mud in Ambrose Channel at 10:15. This time she was able to free herself and proceeded on to Bremen, a little more than 24hours <b>late.</b> <b>This</b> voyage was further marred by the apparent suicide of a despondent New York attorney on 30 May. The man, headed to the spa town of Bad Nauheim in Hesse, had previously suffered a nervous breakdown and was under the care of a doctor on board the ship at the time he jumped overboard.|$|E

2500|$|The idea of {{characteristic}} earthquakes was {{the basis}} of the Parkfield prediction: fairly similar earthquakes in 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934, and 1966 suggested a pattern of breaks every 21.9 years, {{with a standard deviation of}} ±3.1 years. Extrapolation from the 1966 event led to a prediction of an earthquake around 1988, or before 1993 at the latest (at the 95% confidence interval). The appeal of such a method is that the prediction is derived entirely from the trend, which supposedly accounts for the unknown and possibly unknowable earthquake physics and fault parameters. [...] However, in the Parkfield case the predicted earthquake did not occur until 2004, a decade <b>late.</b> <b>This</b> seriously undercuts the claim that earthquakes at Parkfield are quasi-periodic, and suggests the individual events differ sufficiently in other respects to question whether they have distinct characteristics in common.|$|E
