The book was longer than the previous installments of the series and Tripathi clarified that all the loose ends <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous book would be addressed, {{with the death of}} certain characters. Following the release of the cover art, it was announced that the publication rights of the books have been bought by both US and UK publisher houses. Like The Immortals of Meluha and The Secret of the Nagas, the book contained innovative marketing techniques, including launching interactive apps, merchandise and a music album titled Vayuputras, containing music inspired by different events in the series.|$|E
5|$|The Javan rhino {{can live}} around 30–45years in the wild. It {{historically}} inhabited lowland rain forest, wet grasslands, and large floodplains. It is mostly solitary, except for courtship and offspring-rearing, though groups may occasionally congregate near wallows and salt licks. Aside from humans, adults have no predators in their range. The Javan rhino usually avoids humans, but will attack when it feels threatened. Scientists and conservationists rarely study the animals directly {{due to their}} extreme rarity and the danger of interfering with such an endangered species. Researchers rely on camera traps and fecal samples to gauge health and behavior. Consequently, the Javan rhino is the least studied of all rhino species. Two adult rhinos with their calves were filmed in a motion-triggered video released on February 28, 2011, by WWF and Indonesia's National Park Authority, which proved it is still breeding in the wild. In April 2012, the National Parks Authority released video showing 35 individual Javan rhinos, including mother/offspring pairs and courting adults. As of 2016 there are only 63 individuals <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild and none captive.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantage}} of a DH laser is that the region where free electrons and holes exist simultaneously—the active region—is confined to the thin middle layer. This means that many more of the electron-hole pairs can contribute to amplification—not so many are <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> poorly amplifying periphery. In addition, light is reflected from the heterojunction; hence, the light is confined to the region where the amplification takes place.|$|E

25|$|One {{style of}} Maury known as rancio is {{produced}} when the wine is racked into clear glass demi-johns or bonbonne and <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer sun to oxidize and age.

Once the wine has finished aging for the summer it is usually blended with wine that has spent time aging in large foudres oak cask or sold separately as Maury Rancio.|$|E

25|$|It was {{immediately}} clear that most media markets which had stations that were owned by Tribune would receive the CW affiliation, leaving Fox Television Stations, UPN's second largest affiliate group (after the UPN O owned by CBS Television Stations), without any network programming during primetime hours.

25|$|In media {{markets where}} there were {{separate}} affiliates of The WB and UPN, one local station was <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> merger. Many of these stations signed with MyNetworkTV including {{the vast majority of}} the Fox stations acquired in the 2001 acquisition of BHC Communications (the former Chris-Craft stations). Additionally, MyNetworkTV signed with three Tribune stations that did not take the CW affiliation: WPHL (channel 17) in Philadelphia, WATL (channel 36) in Atlanta and KTWB (channel 20) in Seattle. Tribune had indicated interest in Fox-developed programming blocks such as MyNetworkTV for stations that did not pick up the CW affiliation; the company announced on May 15 that the aforementioned stations would join MyNetworkTV. In contrast, CBS initially seemed more hostile to MyNetworkTV, and announced its remaining UPN affiliates – KTXA (channel 21) in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex, WSBK-TV (channel 38) in Boston, WBFS-TV (channel 33) in Miami/Fort Lauderdale, and WUPL (channel 54) in New Orleans as well as WB affiliate WTCN-CA (channel 50) in West Palm Beach – would all become independent stations. Four of the five stations, excluding KTXA, eventually all joined MyNetworkTV.|$|E

500|$|The {{standard}} way {{of measuring}} rainfall or snowfall {{is the standard}} rain gauge, {{which can be found}} in 100-mm (4-in) plastic and 200-mm (8-in) metal varieties. The inner cylinder is filled by [...] of rain, with overflow flowing into the outer cylinder. Plastic gauges have markings on the inner cylinder down to [...] resolution, while metal gauges require use of a stick designed with the appropriate [...] markings. After the inner cylinder is filled, the amount inside it is discarded, then filled with the remaining rainfall in the outer cylinder until all the fluid in the outer cylinder is gone, adding to the overall total until the outer cylinder is empty. Other types of gauges include the popular wedge gauge (the cheapest rain gauge and most fragile), the tipping bucket rain gauge, and the weighing rain gauge. For those looking to measure rainfall the most inexpensively, a can that is cylindrical with straight sides will act as a rain gauge if <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open, but its accuracy will depend on what ruler is used to measure the rain with. Any of the above rain gauges can be made at home, with enough know-how.|$|E

When he was hired to direct the film, Pakula only offered the role to Harrison Ford, believing that the actor possessed an [...] "Everyman quality" [...] that best suited the character. [...] Ford's casting was confirmed in March 1989. He received a $7 million salary for the role. Turow was initially uncertain of Ford portraying Rusty but relented after seeing {{a few of the}} actor's films. Ford said, [...] "Friends warned me this was a tough role because Rusty is such a passive, interior character. Though Rusty's in every scene, all the action takes place around him. Things happen to him." [...] Upon being cast, Ford read the novel to avoid arguments over events and details that were <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book. Ford also suggested to Pakula that Rusty have a buzz cut. He explained, [...] "There are many things I found I could express with that short haircut.

500|$|The {{hospital}} corpsman and sniper of a four-man reconnaissance {{and surveillance}} team, SEAL Team 10. Wahlberg {{was the first}} actor to sign on as a star of the film during its early stages of development. He agreed to portray Luttrell after reading Peter Berg's script. Wahlberg chose not to read Luttrell's book Lone Survivor during production to avoid arguments with Berg over events and details that were <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book. [...] "The problem when adapting a piece of material like that is that you always feel like something is missing", he explained. [...] "I wanted to come at it from this perspective." [...] Of Wahlberg's portrayal, Luttrell stated, [...] "Wahlberg is a consummate professional, and he's a great actor. It was a little strange watching somebody trying to play me, but {{we talked about it}} and I knew it would turn out great. I was more worried about the other guys because they’re not around to speak for themselves." [...] Wahlberg has since cited Lone Survivor as his favorite film role as an actor and producer: [...] "This is the best working experience I’ve ever had, under the toughest conditions. I remember early on as an actor, you worked a long, hard day, but you did something you felt was special, and that car ride home you couldn’t stop thinking about it. I had that feeling every day on this movie." ...|$|E
500|$|The Berlin Wall, {{like the}} much longer inner German border between East and West Germany, was {{designed}} with two purposes in mind: to obstruct would-be border-crossers and to enable border guards {{to detect and}} stop illegal border crossings. In its final form, the [...] wall consisted of inner and outer concrete walls separated by a [...] "death strip" [...] some [...] to [...] wide. [...] It was guarded by around 11,500 Grenztruppen, the Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic who were authorised to use any means necessary, including firearms, to prevent border breaches. [...] The shooting orders, or Schießbefehl, issued to the border guards instructed that people attempting to cross the Wall were criminals, and {{that the use of}} deadly force was required to deal with them: [...] "Do not hesitate to use your firearm, not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children, which is a tactic the traitors have often used". [...] Some guards have since claimed that the motto at the time was [...] "a dead refugee is better than an escaped one". At first, wounded or shot refugees were <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open until they were removed, so that people from West Berlin and the western press could see them as well. After the reactions to the public death of Peter Fechter, border guards were ordered to move any casualties out of West Berlin's field of view. Negative reporting was sought to be prevented. Because of this, border guards often pulled people down into the car-moat {{that was part of the}} whole border security system. In some cases, the removal of the body was done only after nightfall.|$|E
