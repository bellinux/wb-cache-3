6000|$|... "It isn't {{her fault}} if she hasn't got no better," [...] says the woman, rather angrily. [...] "She's {{ready to turn}} her hand to anything. Charing, washing, <b>laying-out,</b> keeping empty houses--nothing comes amiss to her. She's my half-sister, and I think I ought to know." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{preparation}} {{was easily}} made, as it required {{nothing more than}} the snuffy black bonnet, the snuffy black shawl, the pattens and the indispensable umbrella, without which neither a lying-in nor a <b>laying-out</b> could by any possibility be attempted. When Mrs Gamp had invested herself with these appendages she returned to her chair, and sitting down again, declared herself quite ready.|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile the supply-wagons had arrived, and Captain Maynard was {{overseeing}} the <b>laying-out</b> {{of the camp}} just below the agency. Lieutenant Payne and his command returned at five o'clock, and {{in a short time}} the little village of white tents was in order. Curtis came over to insist that the officers take dinner with them at [...] "the parsonage," [...] and, as Captain Maynard had already spoken of the good company and the excellent dinner he had enjoyed {{in the middle of the}} day, Lieutenant Payne was quite ready to comply, especially as his lunch had been as light as his breakfast.|$|E
6000|$|... "One of the {{greatest}} reforms that could be, in these reforming days," [...] she observed, [...] "would be to have women architects. The mischief with houses built to rent {{is that they are}} all mere male contrivances. No woman would ever plan chambers where there is no earthly place to set a bed except against a window or door, or waste the room in entries that might be made into closets. I don't see, for my part, apropos to the modern movement for opening new professions to the female sex, why there should not be well-educated female architects. The planning and arrangement of houses, and the <b>laying-out</b> of grounds, are a fair subject of womanly knowledge and taste. It is the teaching of Nature. What would anybody think of a bluebird's nest that had been built entirely by Mr. Blue, without the help of his wife?" ...|$|E
60|$|For {{the higher}} arts of construction, some {{acquaintance}} {{with the more}} special division of Mathematics is indispensable. The village carpenter, who lays out his work by empirical rules, equally with the builder of a Britannia Bridge, makes hourly reference {{to the laws of}} space-relations. The surveyor who measures the land purchased; the architect in designing a mansion to be built on it; the builder when laying out the foundations; the masons in cutting the stones; and the various artizans who put up the fittings; are all guided by geometrical truths. Railway-making is regulated from beginning to end by geometry: alike in the preparation of plans and sections; in staking out the line; in the mensuration of cuttings and embankments; in the designing and building of bridges, culverts, viaducts, tunnels, stations. Similarly with the harbours, docks, piers, and various engineering and architectural works that fringe the coasts and overspread the country, as well as the mines that run underneath it. And now-a-days, even the farmer, for the correct <b>laying-out</b> of his drains, has recourse to the level--that is, to geometrical principles.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{in effect}} Schiller, during his abode in Bauerbach, did {{once or twice}} receive little subventions of money from his Father, {{although}} never without earnest and not superfluous admonition to become more frugal, and take better heed in <b>laying-out</b> his money. For economics were, by Schiller's own confession, [...] "not at all his talent; it cost him less," [...] he says, [...] "to execute a whole conspiracy and tragedy-plot than to adjust his scheme of housekeeping."—At {{this time it was}} never the Father himself who wrote to Schiller, but always Christophine, by his commission; and on the other hand, Schiller too never risked writing directly to his Father, as he felt but too well how little on his part had been done to justify the flight in his Father's eyes. He writes accordingly, likewise on that 8th December 1782, to his Publisher Schwan: [...] "If you can accelerate the printing of my Fiesco, you will very much oblige me by doing so. You know that nothing but the prohibition to become an Author drove me out of the Würtemberg service. If I now, on this side, don't soon let my native country hear of me, they will say the step I took was useless and without real motive." ...|$|E
60|$|She was a fat old woman, this Mrs Gamp, with a husky {{voice and}} a moist eye, which she had a {{remarkable}} power of turning up, and only showing the white of it. Having very little neck, it cost her some trouble to look over herself, if one may say so, at those to whom she talked. She wore a very rusty black gown, rather the worse for snuff, and a shawl and bonnet to correspond. In these dilapidated articles of dress she had, on principle, arrayed herself, time out of mind, on such occasions as the present; for this at once expressed a decent amount of veneration for the deceased, and invited the next of kin to present her with a fresher suit of weeds; an appeal so frequently successful, that the very fetch and ghost of Mrs Gamp, bonnet and all, might be seen hanging up, any hour in the day, {{in at least a}} dozen of the second-hand clothes shops about Holborn. The face of Mrs Gamp--the nose in particular--was somewhat red and swollen, and it was difficult to enjoy her society without becoming conscious of a smell of spirits. Like most persons who have attained to great eminence in their profession, she took to hers very kindly; insomuch that, setting aside her natural predilections as a woman, she went to a lying-in or a <b>laying-out</b> with equal zest and relish.|$|E
60|$|Johann Christoph Friedrich Schiller was {{a native}} of Marbach, a small town of Würtemberg, {{situated}} {{on the banks of the}} Neckar. He was born on the 10th of November 1759,—a few months later than our own Robert Burns. Schiller's early culture was favoured by the dispositions, but obstructed by the outward circumstances of his parents. Though removed above the pressure of poverty, their station was dependent and fluctuating; it involved a frequent change of place and plan. Johann Caspar Schiller, the father, had been a surgeon in the Bavarian army; he served in the Netherlands during the Succession War. After his return home to Würtemberg, he laid aside the medical profession, having obtained a commission of ensign and adjutant under his native Prince. This post he held successively in two regiments; he had changed into the second, and was absent on active duty when Friedrich was born. The Peace of Paris put an end to his military employment; but Caspar had shown himself an intelligent, unassuming and useful man, and the Duke of Würtemberg was willing to retain him in his service. The <b>laying-out</b> of various nurseries and plantations in the pleasure-grounds of Ludwigsburg and Solitude was intrusted to the retired soldier, now advanced to the rank of captain: he removed from one establishment to another, from time to time; and continued in the Duke's pay till death. In his latter years he resided chiefly at Ludwigsburg.|$|E
6000|$|A month ago, {{passing through}} the shabby {{familiar}} square, I brushed against a withered old man tottering down the street under a load of yarn. It was piled on a wheelbarrow which his feeble hands could not have raised but for the rope of yarn that supported it from his shoulders; and though Auld Licht was written on his patient eyes, I did not immediately recognize Jamie Whamond. Years ago Jamie was a sturdy weaver and fervent lover whom I {{had the right to}} call my friend. Turn back the century a few decades, and we are together on a moonlight night, taking a short cut through the fields from the farm of Craigiebuckle. Buxom were Craigiebuckle's [...] "dochters," [...] and Jamie was Janet's accepted suitor. It was a muddy road through damp grass, and we picked our way silently over its ruts and pools. [...] "I'm thinkin'," [...] Jamie said at last, a little wistfully, [...] "that I micht hae been as weel wi' Chirsty." [...] Chirsty was Janet's sister, and Jamie had first thought of her. Craigiebuckle, however, strongly advised him to take Janet instead, and he consented. Alack! heavy wobs have taken all the grace from Janet's shoulders this many a year, though she and Jamie go bravely down the hill together. Unless they pass the allotted span of life, the [...] "poorshouse" [...] will never know them. As for bonny Chirsty, she proved a flighty thing, and married a deacon in the Established Church. The Auld Lichts groaned over her fall, Craigiebuckle hung his head, and the minister told her sternly to go her way. But a few weeks afterwards Lang Tammas, the chief elder, was observed talking with her for an hour in Gowrie's close; and the very next Sabbath Chirsty pushed her husband in triumph into her father's pew. The minister, though completely taken by surprise, at once referred to the stranger, in a prayer of great length, as a brand that might yet be plucked from the burning. Changing his text, he preached at him; Lang Tammas, the precentor, and the whole congregation (Chirsty included), sang at him; and before he exactly realized his position he had become an Auld Licht for life. Chirsty's triumph was complete when, next week, in broad daylight, too, the minister's wife called, and (in the presence of Betsy Munn, who vouches for the truth of the story) graciously asked her to come up to the manse on Thursday, at 4 p. m., and drink a dish of tea. Chirsty, who knew her position, of course begged modestly to be excused; but a coolness arose over the invitation between her and Janet--who felt slighted--that was only made up at the <b>laying-out</b> of Chirsty's father-in-law, to which Janet was pleasantly invited.|$|E

50|$|The Analatos Painter {{belongs to}} the {{transition}} from Late Geometric to Early Proto-Attic vase painting. He {{is thought to have}} been a pupil of the Late Geometric Statathou Painter. The earliest works ascribed to him are still within a clear Late Geometric tradition. For example, one of his Geometric hydriai depicts a prothesis (<b>laying-out</b> of a body), showing Egyptian influences. The adoption of eastern influences was a key feature of the subsequent Orientalising Period, of which the Analatos Painter {{was one of the main}} early proponents. Characteristic of this new style were fantastic animals, sphinxes without wings or faces, rows of dancing men or women, cable patterns and rosettes. His oldest known amphora, now in the Ashmolean Museum shows a row of two-horsed chariots on its belly, as does a loutrophoros in the Louvre and several other pieces. In the execution of detail, he frequently followed older precepts.|$|E
50|$|After this loss, Rick Steiner {{debuted in}} TNA and helped Scott attack Tomko.

Tomko {{had been placed in}} the match against fellow Coalition member A.J. Styles because original contestant Jeff Jarrett no-showed (due to his wife's death). Christian was able to convince Tomko to continue on as his ally, which later came in handy as Tomko would go on to do much of the brunt work in the Coalition's feud against the returned Abyss and Sting, though he would be twice pinned by Abyss at PPV's after taking a Black Hole Slam each time. However, the Coalition finally avenged these losses with another bloody beatdown of Abyss which also featured the <b>laying-out</b> of Sting on the July 26 Impact!.|$|E
50|$|From these {{different}} images another type, the Lamentation itself, {{arose from the}} 11th century, always giving a more prominent position to Mary, who either holds the body, and later has it across her lap, or sometimes falls back {{in a state of}} collapse as Joseph and others hold the body. In a very early Byzantine depiction of the 11th century, a scene of this type is placed just outside the mouth of the tomb, but around the same time other images place the scene {{at the foot of the}} empty cross - in effect relocating it in both time (to before the bearing, <b>laying-out</b> and anointing of the body) as well as space. This became the standard scene in Western Gothic art, and even when the cross is subsequently seen less often, the landscape background is usually retained. In Early Netherlandish painting of the 15th century the three crosses often appear in the background of the painting, a short distance from the scene.|$|E

A separate door to the north led to a vestibule and a funeral chapel with a main floor capacity of 150 and 50 in the balcony, {{as well as a}} separate choir balcony. An adjacent room for use of clergy and family had a capacity of about 15, and connected to a [...] "retiring room", basically a full bathroom. The room for the use of clergy and family had a private entrance separate from the entrance to the chapel itself.

50|$|Thomas Rowe {{was born}} in Penzance, Cornwall, United Kingdom, the eldest son of Richard Rowe and Ursula Mumford, and {{attended}} Barnes Academy. At 15 he became a draftsman in his father's building business before the family emigrated to Australia in 1848. From 1857 he practised as an architect in Sydney, Bathurst, Orange, Newcastle and Goulburn. In 1872 he was elected alderman for Bourke Ward of the Sydney City Council, which he held until 1876. During his time on the council he worked on sanitation efforts related to improving the Sydney water supply. Rowe Street, which runs from Pitt Street to Castlereagh Street, {{was at that time}} named after him by in a vote by the council. In February 1877 {{he was elected to the}} first Manly Municipal Council and was elected first Mayor of Manly, overseeing the first <b>laying-out</b> of the town of Manly, and serving as an alderman until 1880.

50|$|Muhammad's father (the name Abu Bakr {{was seldom}} used) {{was one of}} the many captives taken by Khalid ibn al-Walid after the Battle of Ayn al-Tamr. He was a {{coppersmith}} from a town called Jirjaya (Gerzhiya) (Arabic: جرجرايا, south east of Baghdad), settled and working there, where a decisive battle took place in year 12. Certain historians contend that it was Abu Bakr's mother, named Sireen (Shirin=sweet), who had been taken captive. But, according to the Encyclopedia of Islam (London; Leiden & E.J. Brill, 1971), vol. 3, p. 947, Ibn Sirin's mother, Safiyya - a slave of the caliph Abu Bakr - was held in such esteem within the community that when she died, her <b>laying-out</b> was performed by three of Muhammad's wives and eighteen Badris (veterans of the battle of Badr), led by Ubay ibn Ka'b, were present at her burial. 'Omar sent him as a present, either directly to Anas ibn Malik (one of the most authoritative sources on the life and opinions expressed by Muhammad) or first to a man called Talha Al-Bukhari (from Bukhara, Central Asia) who, in turn, gave him to Anas.|$|E
50|$|Tŷ Mawr was {{discovered}} by Peter Smith and Cecil Vaughan Owen in 1971, by when it {{was used as a}} farm building, clad in corrugated sheeting. The house {{was the subject of a}} building survey in 1979. In 1997 dendrochronological dating of the building was commissioned by Cadw, which showed a felling date of 1460 AD for the timber used in the initial construction of the building. Archaeological excavations were carried out in conjunction with the building survey in 1979, and again in 1997 by the Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust, which established the main phases of occupation of the house. This showed that the house was a good example of a Welsh longhouse with a cattle byre at one end. A study of the carpentry techniques and the geometric basis for the <b>laying-out</b> of the house was also undertaken. Other studies included agricultural evidence including the survival of early fruit trees in the surrounding hedge rows and the landscape history of Trefnant township. The property had been purchased by the Secretary of State for Wales in 1975 for £2,000 and was leased back to Powis Estates for 999 years by the Welsh Office in 1997.

5000|$|In {{this chapter}} Braverman {{discusses}} scientific management, or Taylorism, {{and how it}} came into being. Braverman claims that “enormous growth {{in the size of}} enterprises, the beginnings of the monopolistic organization of industry, and the purposive and systematic application of science to production” were the forces that brought scientific management into being. He defines scientific management as, “an attempt to apply the methods of science to the increasingly complex problems of the control of labor in rapidly growing capitalist enterprises.” He goes on to say that, “it lacks the characteristics of a true science because its assumptions reflect nothing more than the outlook of the capitalist with regard to the conditions of production.” Braverman further distinguishes between scientific management and other sciences by pointing out {{that it is not a}} “science of work” but rather a “science of the management of others’ work under capitalist conditions”. He examines Taylor’s 3 Principles. The first principle is “The managers assume[...] [...] the burden of gathering together all of the traditional knowledge which in the past has been possessed by the workmen and then of classifying, tabulating, and reducing this knowledge to rules, laws, and formulae[...] [...]” Braverman calls this first principle “the dissociation of the labor process from the skills of the workers.” The second principle is “All possible brain work should be removed from the shop and centered in the planning or <b>laying-out</b> department [...] [...] [...]” Braverman calls this principle “the separation of conception from execution [...] [...] [...]” The third principle is “The work of every workman is fully planned out by the management [...] [...] [...]” Braverman calls this “the use of this monopoly over knowledge to control each step of the labor process and its mode of execution.” ...|$|E
