5|$|In 1539, the friary {{was seized}} by the crown along with five others in the area {{including}} the Dominican monastery of Blackfriars. At {{the time of its}} capture the friary had seven brethren and three novices including the prior, Andrew Kell. The monks and nuns were pensioned and the friars received gratuities. Some took jobs as chantry priests or accommodation in parish livings. Those nuns who were of good birth returned to their families. The bells, <b>lead</b> <b>plate</b> and vestments were turned over to the crown. Most of the building and lands were sold to the lesser gentry, new nobility, and town merchants or to borough corporations. At the time of the Dissolution there were a prior, ten friars and three novices.|$|E

500|$|Developed by the Monotype {{drawing office}} team in Salfords, Surrey, led by Fritz Steltzer, the project veered {{away from a}} purely {{faithful}} revival towards a denser, more condensed design. This differentiated it from the other Janson revivals on the market. Nicholas commented [...] "I think it was Morison's take on Janson - made a little heavier and narrower to give improved legibility and economy." [...] Typesetting expert Yannis Haralambous wrote of being told by a Monotype manager that the typeface was designed particularly for sale in Germany [...] "to appeal {{to those who have}} a weakness for Fraktur" [...] (blackletter or 'Gothic' typefaces, still very popular in Germany in the 1930s). In its dense design it may be able to compliment blackletter well, and Morison in his article on Leipzig printing suggested that this might have been a motivation behind the original's design style. Ehrhardt's technical production followed Monotype's standard method of the period. The characters were drawn on paper in large plan diagrams by the highly experienced drawing office team, led and trained by Steltzer, who Monotype had recruited from the German printing industry. The drawing staff who executed the design was disproportionately female and in many cases recruited from the local area and the nearby Reigate art school. A wax-copy was made from these drawing, the wax-copy was used to produce a <b>lead</b> <b>plate</b> with the design. These plates were then used as a plan for machining metal punches to stamp matrices in the Benton-pantographs. It was Monotype's standard practice at the time to first engrave a limited number of characters and print proofs from them to test overall balance of colour on the page, before completing the remaining characters.|$|E

2500|$|In a 1909 paper, On a Diffuse Reflection of the α-Particles, Geiger and Marsden {{described}} the experiment {{by which they}} proved that alpha particles can indeed be scattered by more than 90°. In their experiment, they prepared a small conical glass tube (AB) containing [...] "radium emanation" [...] (radon), [...] "radium A" [...] (actual radium), and [...] "radium C" [...] (bismuth-214); its open end sealed with mica. [...] This was their alpha particle emitter. [...] They then set up a <b>lead</b> <b>plate</b> (P), behind which they placed a fluorescent screen (S). [...] The tube was held {{on the opposite side}} of plate, such that the alpha particles it emitted could not directly strike the screen. [...] They noticed a few scintillations on the screen, because some alpha particles got around the plate by bouncing off air molecules. [...] They then placed a metal foil (R) to the side of the <b>lead</b> <b>plate.</b> [...] They pointed the tube at the foil to see if the alpha particles would bounce off it and strike the screen on the other side of the plate, and observed an increase in the number of scintillations on the screen. Counting the scintillations, they observed that metals with higher atomic mass, such as gold, reflected more alpha particles than lighter ones such as aluminium.|$|E
2500|$|Geiger and Marsden then {{wanted to}} {{estimate}} {{the total number of}} alpha particles that were being reflected. [...] The previous setup was unsuitable for doing this because the tube contained several radioactive substances (radium plus its decay products) and thus the alpha particles emitted had varying ranges, and because it was difficult for them to ascertain at what rate the tube was emitting alpha particles. [...] This time, they placed a small quantity of radium C (bismuth-214) on the <b>lead</b> <b>plate,</b> which bounced off a platinum reflector (R) and onto the screen. [...] They found that {{only a tiny fraction of}} the alpha particles that struck the reflector bounced onto the screen (in this case, 1 in 8000).|$|E

6000|$|To secure Buried Letters from Damp.--They may {{be wrapped}} in waxed cloth or paper, if {{there be no}} fear of the ravages of insects. <b>Lead</b> <b>plate</b> is far more safe: {{it can be made}} easily enough by a {{traveller}} out of his bullets. (See [...] "Lead.") A glass bottle (with something that insects cannot eat, such as lead-plate, sealing-wax or clay, put carefully over the cork) or an earthen jar may be used. The quill of a large feather will hold a long letter, if it is written in very small handwriting and on thin paper, and it will preserve it from the wet. After the letter has been rolled up and inserted in the quill, the open end of the latter may be squeezed flat between two stones, heated sufficiently to soften the quill (see [...] "Horn") but not so hot as to burn it, and then, for greater security against wet, the end of the quill should be twisted tight. Wax affords another easy means of closing the quill.|$|E

We found the optimal current density of synthesizing <b>lead</b> oxide <b>plate</b> films is 10 - 25 mA/cm 2 {{when there were no}} Cl- ions in the electrolyte. If equal Cl- ions were added in lead nitrate aqueous solution, the optimal current density of synthesizing <b>lead</b> oxide <b>plate</b> films is less than 10 mA/cm 2.
