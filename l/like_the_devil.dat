5|$|Films {{released}} {{during the}} dump months {{have not always}} been consigned to cinematic oblivion. Some, like Tremors and Office Space, have become cult classics. Starting with Cloverfield, some 21st-century dump-months releases have managed to exceed $100 million on box office receipts. The similar success of low-budget horror films <b>like</b> <b>The</b> <b>Devil</b> Inside and Mama in the early 2010s has prompted studios to release films in that genre at times of the year other than Halloween and the dump months.|$|E
500|$|A mutant who has {{the ability}} to teleport, and {{is also a member of}} the Hellfire Club. Flemyng, who had {{previously}} been considered for Beast in The Last Stand, said he did not want more make-up heavy roles after playing Calibos in Clash of the Titans, but made an exception for Azazel as he liked working with Vaughn. Due to the Cold War setting, Flemyng tried to imply that Azazel is Russian to partly explain his pleasure in killing CIA agents. The actor spent eight weeks with fight training, particularly with swords, and had to undergo a four-hour make-up process, which like Mystique was designed by Spectral Motion—but did not include Azazel's tail, which was computer-generated. Shuler Donner considered that the problems with the shade of red on Azazel's skin - [...] "some looked <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Devil,</b> some like a man wearing red paint" [...] - was overcome by adding scars that made him more human, eyes brighter than Flemyng's own, and [...] "a black mane of hair that seemed to tie everything in".|$|E

[...] "Corley's Spies" [...] (which became Company A, Capt.

They were skilled at moving around undetected by the Yankees. I once found some correspondence regarding the resignation of Corley's first lieutenant, which revealed that [...] "Corley's Spies" [...] had served briefly in the Indian Territory in Albert Pike's command. When the regiment was organized, Captain Corley was promoted to major. Samuel Corley was one of those larger-than-life characters whose daring exploits would make a great book and movie. He was a preacher who talked about Christian love and forgiveness on Sunday, and fought Yankees <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>devil</b> during the week. He was killed in action at Fourche Bayou (Battle of Little Rock) on September 10, 1863.|$|E

2500|$|With {{respect to}} {{instruction}} in composition, {{in addition to}} having Handel apply himself to traditional fugue and cantus firmus work, Zachow, recognizing Handel's precocious talents, systematically introduced Handel to the variety of styles and masterworks contained in his extensive library. He did this by requiring Handel to copy selected scores. [...] "I used to write <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>devil</b> in those days", Handel recalled much later. Much of this copying was entered into a notebook that Handel maintained {{for the rest of his}} life. Although it has since disappeared, the notebook has been sufficiently described to understand what pieces Zachow wished Handel to study. Among the chief composers represented in this exercise book were Johann Krieger, an [...] "old master" [...] in the fugue and prominent organ composer, Johann Caspar Kerll, a representative of the [...] "southern style" [...] after his teacher Frescobaldi and imitated later by Handel, Johann Jakob Froberger, an [...] "internationalist" [...] also closely studied by Buxtehude and Bach, and Georg Muffat, whose amalgam of French and Italian styles and his synthesis of musical forms influenced Handel.|$|E

[...] was built in two years rather than three, while changing a barbette gun on a ship was reduced from a two-day operation to two hours. His example obliged all shipyards, both navy and private, to reduce the time they took to complete a ship, making savings in cost and allowing new designs to enter service more rapidly. He used all the tricks he could devise: an official who refused to step outside his office to personally supervise the work was offered a promotion to the tropics; he would find out {{the name of one}} or two men amongst a work crew and then make a point of complimenting them on their work and using their names, giving the impression he knew everyone personally; he took a chair and table into the yard where some operation was to be carried out and declared his intention to stay there until the operation was completed.
