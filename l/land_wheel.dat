40|$|Abstract. <b>Land</b> <b>wheel</b> is an {{important}} part of vegetable transplanting machine, its strength directly affects the whole performance. In this paper, Three-dimensional model of <b>land</b> <b>wheel</b> was built by Solidworks and imported into ANSYS by interface module between Solidworks and ANSYS. The load was applied with rotation angular velocity in this study, the stress, strain and displacement of the <b>land</b> <b>wheel</b> of a vegetable transplanter in operation were obtained through static analysis on the <b>land</b> <b>wheel</b> with finite element method analysis of software ANSYS, the maximum deformation and stress occurred at the rim and the studs on wheel, the results of static stress analysis will provide theoretical basis for design of vegetable transplanter. 5 order post-processing was conducted on the wheel, natural frequency and mode shapes was obtained after calculating and analyzing, Considerations should be taken in keeping the frequency of the wheel different from that of ambient vibration, which provides references for avoiding resonance during test wheel's running...|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{precision}} seeding control system was developed based on GPS, which could achieve real-time adjustment of seeding speed to ensure seed distribution uniformity. Parameters including seeding rate, row spacing and hole number of {{seed metering device}} were entered by users which were transferred by CAN bus to the controller. Its electronic speed control system could work out rotational speed of sowing axis matching with operating speed of tractor automatically. Seed metering device was driven by the hydraulic motor. The field experiment results demonstrated that rate of spacing of normally sown seeds and variable coefficient of this system comparing to traditional <b>land</b> <b>wheel</b> driven planter was relatively 94. 1  %, 24. 6  % and 89. 1  %, 33. 1  % while operating speed was 5. 9  km/h. If the variation range of seeding spacing shrinks 40  % according the standard request, rate of spacing of normally sown seeds of {{precision seeding}} control system was 89. 7  % exceeded the traditional <b>land</b> <b>wheel</b> 23  %...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of a manual precision rice planter was undertaken {{with the aim of}} achieving precise planting on the farm. The machine was designed, constructed and tested on the University farm in Yola-Nigeria, using locally available materials. The machine consists of roller-metering device that rotates and receives constant flow of seeds from a bottomless hopper, a furrow opener and covering device. There is a front <b>land</b> <b>wheel</b> from which the seed-metering device is directly driven through chain and sprockets. The frame is made of hollow pipe on which the entire assembly is mounted. The machine performance evaluation was carried out using paddy rice BG 302 variety. The actual field capacity of the machine was found to be 0. 067 ha/h with field efficiency of 77. 9 %, and application rate of 21. 62 kg/ha. The planter has a mean planting depth of 3. 2 cm, hill distance of 15. 12 cm and 6 seeds per hill. It was concluded that efficient and precision planting could be better achieved with this kind of machine than with rice seed broadcasters...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is force effect {{analysis}} of ploughing rigs. MSC Adams software was used for mathematical-physical model drafting and subsequent evaluation of measured data from tensometrical load sensing. Designed model was utilized for force reactions calculations under the driving wheels of a tractor using analysis of spatial system of forces of tractors three point hitch. Field measurement data and data from MSC Adams software were tabular and graphically processed. Dependencies between plough and tractor connection setting and output performance of ploughing rigs were clarified. Results from experimental measurement with fully-mounted plough point out on the utilization of longitudinal and lateral position of ploughs CG for reducing of difference in load between furrow and <b>land</b> <b>wheel</b> with properly adjusted connection between plough and tractor. A result from experimental measurement with semi-mounted plough confirms the fact of significant difference in vertical load between rear axle wheels. This negative phenomenon could be eliminated with usage of traction cylinder localized in construction of semi-mounted ploughs over the horizontal joint. Correct adjustment of tractors three point hitch in case of fully-mounted ploughs and utilization of traction cylinder in case of semi-mounted ploughs have got positive influence on fuel consumption and field performance of ploughing rigs...|$|E

50|$|An {{occasional}} {{problem with}} amphibians is with ensuring the wheels {{are in the}} correct position for landing. In normal operation, the pilot uses a checklist, verifying each item. Since amphibians can land with them up or down though, the pilot must take extra care to ensure they are correct for the chosen <b>landing</b> place. <b>Landing</b> <b>wheels</b> up on <b>land</b> may damage the keel (unless done on wet grass, a technique occasionally used by pilots of pure flying boats), while <b>landing</b> <b>wheels</b> down on water will almost always flip the aircraft upside down, causing substantial damage.|$|R
