The reaction with <b>lower</b> <b>alcohols</b> (methanol, ethanol) takes place at 100-120 °C with acidic heterogeneous catalysts (cation exchanger). The reaction of higher alcohols (n-butanol, 2-ethylhexanol) is catalysed with sulfuric acid in homogeneous phase.

50|$|Most {{mononuclear}} carbonyl complexes are colorless or {{pale yellow}} volatile liquids or solids that are flammable and toxic. Vanadium hexacarbonyl, a uniquely stable 17-electron metal carbonyl, is a blue-black solid. Di- and polymetallic carbonyls {{tend to be}} more deeply colored. Triiron dodecacarbonyl (Fe3(CO)12) forms deep green crystals. The crystalline metal carbonyls often are sublimable in vacuum, although this process is often accompanied by degradation. Metal carbonyls are soluble in nonpolar and polar organic solvents such as benzene, diethyl ether, acetone, glacial acetic acid and carbon tetrachloride. Some salts of cationic and anionic metal carbonyls are soluble in water or <b>lower</b> <b>alcohols.</b>|$|E

MMF has been detected in the leaves and roots of Chilean Jaborosa magellanica (Solanaceae) and is a component of mammary and uterus care herb tea. It has a typical odor suggestive of maraschino cherries.

40|$|High {{efficient}} {{production of}} <b>lower</b> <b>alcohols</b> (C- 1 -C- 5 mixed alcohols) from hydrogen rich bio-oil derived syngas was achieved in this work. A non-catalytic partial oxidation (NPDX) gasification technology was successfully {{applied in the}} production and conditioning of bio-oil derived syngas using bio-oil (BO) and emulsifying waste engine oil (EWEO) as feedstock. The effects of water addition and feedstock composition on the gasification performances were investigated. When the BO 20 and EWEO 30 was mixed with mass ratio of 1 : 0. 33, the maximum hydrogen yield of 93. 7 % with carbon conversion of 96. 7 % was obtained, and the hydrogen rich bio-oil derived syngas was effectively produced. Furthermore, a two-stage bed reactor was applied in the downstream process of <b>lower</b> <b>alcohols</b> synthesis from hydrogen rich bio-oil derived syngas (H- 2 /CO/CO 2 /CH 4 /N- 2 = 52. 2119. 513. 0 / 9. 4 / 15. 9, v/v). The highest carbon conversion of 42. 5 % and the maximum alcohol yield of 0. 18 kg/kg(cat) h with selectivity of 53. 8 wt% were obtained over the Cu/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 (2. 5) //Cu 25 Fe 22 Co 3 K 3 /SiO 2 (2. 5) catalyst combination system. The mechanism and evaluation for <b>lower</b> <b>alcohols</b> synthesis from model bio-oil derived syngas and model mixture gas were also discussed.

40|$|Religiousness is {{reliably}} {{associated with}} lower substance use, but little research has examined whether self-control helps explain why religiousness predicts lower substance use. Building on prior theoretical work, our studies suggest that self-control mediates the relationship between religiousness {{and a variety of}} substance-use behaviors. Study 1 showed that daily prayer predicted <b>lower</b> <b>alcohol</b> use on subsequent days. In Study 2, religiousness related to <b>lower</b> <b>alcohol</b> use, which was mediated by self-control. Study 3 replicated this mediational pattern using a behavioral measure of self-control. Using a longitudinal design, Study 4 revealed that self-control mediated the relationship between religiousness and <b>lower</b> <b>alcohol</b> use 6 weeks later. Study 5 replicated this mediational pattern again and showed that it remained significant after controlling for trait mindfulness. Studies 6 and 7 replicated and extended these effects to both alcohol and various forms of drug use among community and cross-cultural adult samples. These findings offer novel evidence regarding the role of self-control in explaining why religiousness is {{associated with lower}} substance use...|$|R

40|$|MoO 3 and WO 3 were {{supported}} on γ-Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 with nominal loadings of 10 wt % via wet impregnation. The catalysts were characterized using XRD, TPR, Pulse TPD, Raman, TEM, and BET surface area. The alumina supported catalysts {{were found to}} contain higher Brønsted acidity compared to those supported on silica. These catalysts were evaluated in the hydrogenolysis of glycerol in a continuous flow fixed bed reactor in a temperature range of 250 – 325 °C and a H 2 pressure of 60 bar. All catalysts were active, with activity increasing with temperature as well as Brønsted acidity. The selectivity to ethylene glycol and 1, 2 -propanediol decreased with increase in temperature. In parallel, the selectivity to <b>lower</b> <b>alcohols</b> such as methanol, ethanol, 2 -propanol, and 1 -propanol increased with temperature as the ethylene glycol and 1, 2 -propanediol reacted further to these products due to C–C bond cleavage. The total selectivity to <b>lower</b> <b>alcohols</b> was 34. 6, 64. 8, 70. 6, and 54. 6 % over Mo/Al 2 O 3, Mo/SiO 2, W/Al 2 O 3, and W/SiO 2 respectively.

30|$|The other {{possible}} reason for choosing hexanol as an alcohol is that hexanol is a 6 -carbon straight-chain alcohol that has great {{potential as a}} blending component with diesel fuel owing to its higher energy density, higher cetane number, better blend stability and less hygroscopic nature than other widely studied <b>lower</b> <b>alcohols</b> like ethanol, methanol, and even butanol (De Poures et al. 2017). The latent heat of vaporization, density, and viscosity of hexanol is also closer to that of diesel fuel compared to other alcohols (De Poures et al. 2017).|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide clearer {{insights}} into and identify the key consumer behaviour metrics of the <b>lower</b> <b>alcohol</b> category (< 11 per cent ABV) in the UK wine market. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected via an online survey from a sample size of 598 regular UK wine drinkers. To operationalise the study, five research questions were formulated. A highly structured quantitatively directed questionnaire was designed to find the answers to the research questions. Findings – Barriers to a larger uptake of the product category included non-availability of the products, lower quality perceptions, taste issues, lack of awareness, lack of alcohol's “feel effect” and absence of a <b>lower</b> <b>alcohol</b> drinking occasion. Many UK consumers are not yet convinced how/if <b>lower</b> <b>alcohol</b> wine fits into their wine drinking occasions. The lower ABV wine buyer's main profile characteristics are weighted towards females, Millennial and Baby Boomer age generations, mostly mid to low income, who drink mainly white and rosé wines. <b>Lower</b> <b>alcohol</b> on its own is not seen as a big benefit, thus lower ABV wines should be more creatively communicated to sell the benefits. Originality/value – This study contributes to the knowledge base in that it is the first to investigate consumer behaviour metrics as regards lower ABV wine in one of the world's leading markets, in the process providing some important baseline research information on this category. As such it is of value to academic researchers and practitioners alike. Johan Bruwer, Vladimir Jiranek, Lulie Halstead, Anthony Salib...|$|R
