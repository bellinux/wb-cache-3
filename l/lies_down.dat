5|$|Birdy {{builds a}} new aviary {{in his bedroom}} and {{purchases}} two canaries. He names the female Perta and the male Alfonso after his friend. Upon returning to school, Birdy encounters a classmate, Doris Robinson, and Al encourages him to ask her out on a date. At the prom, Birdy dances unenthusiastically with Doris, leaving her confused and humiliated. Afterwards, Doris drives him to a secluded spot, where Birdy lightly rejects her sexual advances. Birdy returns home to his bedroom and <b>lies</b> <b>down</b> naked in the aviary. In a semi-conscious state, he expresses {{that he wants to}} die and be born again as a bird. He then imagines himself flying like a bird around his room, throughout the house and outside in the neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Formed by five Charterhouse pupils {{including}} Banks, Rutherford, Gabriel, and Anthony Phillips, Genesis {{was named}} by former pupil Jonathan King who arranged them to record several unsuccessful singles and an album. After splitting with King, the group began touring professionally, signing with Charisma Records. Following {{the departure of}} Phillips, Genesis recruited Collins and Hackett and recorded several progressive rock style albums, with live shows centred around Gabriel's theatrical costumes and performances. The group were initially commercially successful in mainland Europe, before entering the UK charts with Foxtrot (1972). They followed this with Selling England by the Pound (1973) and The Lamb <b>Lies</b> <b>Down</b> on Broadway (1974) before Gabriel {{decided to leave the}} group.|$|E
5|$|Founding {{member and}} lead singer Peter Gabriel {{decided to leave}} Genesis in late 1974, midway through the tour for the album The Lamb <b>Lies</b> <b>Down</b> on Broadway. The other members hoped he would reconsider, as {{they were still in}} debt and felt his {{departure}} could destroy the band's future, but ultimately accepted that he would leave. The remaining members felt they still wanted to collaborate musically, and show journalists and critics they were primarily a song writing team that could still produce good music. Keyboardist Tony Banks had been close to Gabriel personally, and did not want the band to split up on top of seeing less of one of his best friends. He had written a number of songs for a possible solo project before deciding they should be used on the new Genesis album.|$|E
40|$|Cattle have {{a species}} {{specific}} movement pattern when <b>lying</b> <b>down</b> and getting up. They need sufficient space for {{their heads to}} perform these movements normally. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the <b>lying</b> <b>down</b> and getting up behaviour of beef bulls at a Swedish farm operation. The hypothesis was that bulls older than 10 months (over approximately 400 kg) were disturbed by a horizontal front rail and that the time to <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> and get up differed from what can be regarded as normal based on earlier scientific studies. The bulls were Swedish Red and White (SRB), Swedish Friesian (SLB) or crossbreeds of these two, and were kept in a cubicle system with a stall front design where there was a horizontal rail 40 cm above the stall floor. The age of the bulls ranged from 4 to 18 months. A group consisting of 33 bulls with weights 424 - 615 kg was chosen for the study. During one week in July 2008, behavioural observations were made daily from 7. 30 to 11. 30 hrs. Thirty-one of the 33 bulls were observed when <b>lying</b> <b>down</b> or getting up. The total number of observations for <b>lying</b> <b>down</b> was 175 and for getting up 157. The median total time for <b>lying</b> <b>down</b> was 27 s and for getting up 6. 9 s, including interrupted sequences. According to a separate regression analysis, body weight was not significantly associated with time for <b>lying</b> <b>down</b> (P> 0. 05). The recorded times for <b>lying</b> <b>down</b> and getting up corresponded well with other studies. The bulls had 21 % interrupted <b>lying</b> <b>down</b> and 3 % interrupted getting up behaviours. During 12 % of the getting up movements they were slipping, whereas this was not recorded during <b>lying</b> <b>down.</b> There were 3 recordings of abnormal <b>lying</b> <b>down</b> and 5 recordings of abnormal getting up. The head was held over the rail during 38 % of the <b>lying</b> <b>down</b> movements and during 76 % of the getting up movements. In conclusion this study did not show any longer times for <b>lying</b> <b>down</b> and getting up in bulls with a head rail at 40 cm above the floor, but there were some interrupted <b>lying</b> <b>down</b> behaviours and slipping at getting up and the head position during these movements may be of importance...|$|R

5|$|In a {{press conference}} held in London in November 2006, Banks, Rutherford, and Collins {{announced}} their reunion for the , their first with Collins in fourteen years. They revealed the initial plan of touring The Lamb <b>Lies</b> <b>Down</b> on Broadway with Gabriel and Hackett. The five met in Glasgow in November 2004 to discuss the idea further, but it never developed further as Gabriel was unable to commit due to other projects. Instead, Banks, Rutherford and Collins decided to proceed with Thompson and Stuermer returning on drums and guitar, respectively. In March 2007, {{a press conference}} was held in New York City to announce the North American leg.|$|E
5|$|Cheetahs breed {{throughout}} the year; they are induced ovulators. Females become sexually mature at 21 to 22 months of age. Females are polyoestrusthey have an oestrus ("heat") cycle every 12days (this {{can vary from}} 10to 20 days), each oestrus lasting one to three days. A female can give birth again after 17 to 20 months; however, on {{the loss of a}} whole litter mothers can mate again. Urine-marking in males becomes more pronounced when a female in their vicinity comes into oestrus. Males fight among one another to secure access to the female; even males in a coalition may show some aggression toward one another on approaching a female. One male eventually wins dominance over the others. Mating, observed mainly at night, begins with the male approaching the female, who <b>lies</b> <b>down</b> on the ground. No courtship behaviour is observed; the male immediately secures hold of the female's nape and copulation takes place. The pair then ignore each other and part ways. However, they meet and copulate a few more times within the next few days. Polyandrous, females can mate with several males. The mean number of motile sperm in a single ejaculation is nearly 25.3million.|$|E
5|$|Madonna <b>lies</b> <b>down</b> on a pew {{and has a}} {{dream in}} which she is falling through space. Suddenly, a woman, {{representing}} power and strength, catches her. She advises Madonna {{to do what is}} right and tosses her back up. Still dreaming, Madonna returns to the statue, which transforms into the black man she had seen earlier. He kisses her forehead and leaves the church as she picks up a knife and cuts her hands, bleeding. Interspersing scenes show Madonna singing and dancing wildly in front of burning crosses, erotic scenes between her and the saint, and the singer being surrounded by a choir inside the church. Madonna wakes up, goes to the jail and tells the police that she had witnessed the crime and that the black man is innocent; the police release him. The video ends as Madonna dances in front of the burning crosses, and then everybody involved in the story line takes a bow as curtains come down on the set.|$|E

The <b>lying</b> <b>down</b> behaviour of the sows, litter size, number of stillborn piglets and number of dead piglets and cause of death during the weaning period were recorded. The data was collected on seven organic farms in Austria and on two agricultural research stations.

Three of the queens wash the horse and adorn it with jewelry and ghee. The horse, hornless goat, and gayal are asphyxiated. The chief queen <b>lies</b> <b>down</b> and the adhvaryu guides the horse's penis against the queen's vagina, signifying the birth of a new king. The animals are dismembered.

25|$|Several weeks later, {{once again}} in the nursery (as in Act I), the family's {{belongings}} are being packed away as the family prepares to leave the estate forever. Trofimov enters in search of his galoshes, and he and Lopakhin exchange opposing world views. Anya enters and reprimands Lopakhin for ordering his workers to begin chopping down the cherry orchard even while the family is still in the house. Lopakhin apologizes and rushes out to stop them for the time being, in the hopes that he will be somehow reconciled with the leaving family. Charlotta enters, lost and in a daze, and insists that the family find her a new position. Ranevskaya tearfully bids her old life goodbye and leaves as the house is shut up forever. In the darkness, Firs wanders into the room and discovers that they have left without him and boarded him inside the abandoned house to die. He <b>lies</b> <b>down</b> on the couch and resigns himself to this fate (apparently dying on the spot). Offstage we hear the axes as they cut down the cherry orchard.|$|E

25|$|In India, the {{practice}} of a hunger protest, where the protestor fasts {{at the door of}} an offending party (typically a debtor) in a public call for justice, was abolished by the government in 1861; this indicates the prevalence of {{the practice}} prior to that date, or at least a public awareness of it. This Indian practice is ancient, going back to around 400 to 750 BC. This can be known since it appears in the Ramayana, which was composed around that time. The actual mention appears in the Ayodhya kanda (the second book of the Ramayana), in Sarga (section) 103. Bharata has gone to ask the exiled Rama to come back and rule the kingdom. Bharata tries many arguments, none of which work, at which point he decides to do a hunger strike. He announces his intention to fast, calls for his charioteer Sumantra to bring him some sacred Kusha grass (which Sumantra won't do, since he's too busy looking at Rama's face, so Bharata has to get the grass himself), and <b>lies</b> <b>down</b> upon the grass in front of Rama. Rama, however, is quickly able to persuade him to abandon the attempt. Rama mentions it as a practice of the brahmanas.|$|E
25|$|At {{the castle}} of Doris, {{preparations}} {{are under way}} for the celebrations of the young countess Raymonda’s name day. Countess Sybille, her aunt, chides those who are present, including Raymonda's two friends Henrietta and Clémence, and the two troubadours Béranger and Bernard, for their idleness and their passion for dancing, telling them of the legendary White Lady, the protector of the castle, who warns the Doris household every time one of its members is in danger and casts punishment on {{those who do not}} fulfil their duties. The young people laugh at the countess’s superstitions and continue to celebrate. The seneschal of the Doris castle announces the arrival of a messenger, sent by Raymonda's fiancé, the noble crusader knight, Jean de Brienne, bearing a letter for his beloved. Raymonda rejoices when she reads that King Andre II of Hungary, for whom Jean de Brienne has fought, is returning home in triumph and Jean de Brienne will arrive at the Doris castle the next day for their wedding. Suddenly, the celebrations are interrupted when the seneschal announces the arrival of an uninvited Saracen knight, Abderakhman and his entourage, who have stopped at the castle seeking shelter for the night. Captivated by Raymonda's beauty, Abderakhman falls in love with her at once and resolves to do anything to win her. The party lasts late into the night and, left alone and exhausted by the day, Raymonda <b>lies</b> <b>down</b> on a couch and falls asleep. As she sleeps, she begins to dream that the White Lady appears illuminated by the moonlight and, with an imperious gesture, orders Raymonda to follow her.|$|E

Their set included The Lamb... performed in its entirety with an encore, a decision that was not supported by the entire band considering most of the audience were not yet familiar with the large amount of new material. The stage show involved new, more elaborate costumes worn by Gabriel, three backdrop screens that displayed 1,450 slides from eight projectors, and a laser lighting display. Music critics often focused their reviews on Gabriel's theatrics and took the band's musical performance as secondary which irritated the rest of the band.|$|E
