500|$|MacLachlan did {{not like}} the bomber training. In a letter to his mother he {{described}} his grievances, [...] "We have started bombing today. It's awful! You have to <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> belly and look through the trapdoor {{in the bottom of the}} plane [...] All the hot oily air from the radiator blows straight into your face. It makes me feel quite sick!". He was enthusiastic about describing the mathematical problems associated with aerial bombing and the use of cameras to judge accuracy rather than using live-munitions, but MacLachlan was more enamoured with air-to-air gunnery. He wrote of his training, [...] "I have been doing air-to-air gunnery with the front guns today. It is super!" [...] Live ammunition was used at the end of the training. MacLachlan was permitted to train using 16 bombs, which cost £1 1s each.|$|E
60|$|I didn't {{take much}} {{notice of the}} place. I didn't really get my bearings. I noticed Twichell got a German bed about two feet wide, the kind in which you've got to <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> edge, because there isn't room to <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> back, and he was way down south in that big room, and I was way up north {{at the other end}} of it, with a regular Sahara in between.|$|E
6000|$|But the jackal answered, 'If {{you really}} want me {{to give you some}} more, you must have your paws tied behind you, and <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> back, so that I can pour it into your mouth.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But, Leonard, she {{has said}} that if you wished it, she would come as if you were <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> bed at home, and with more reverence.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm told you're not {{sleeping}} well," [...] he said; [...] "and you don't look as fit as you ought. I guess <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> back gets monotonous." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Since {{your cousin}} {{is not in}} a {{communicative}} mood, George, perhaps you will inform me why you are <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> face and groaning in that unpleasant and aggressive manner?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Could I <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> sofa, please, Cis? My head aches, and my {{legs are}} SO tired," [...] said little Button, when her tap had been {{answered}} by a sharp [...] "What do you want, child?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not so fast,' {{replied the}} jackal. 'If you really wish to enjoy {{what you are}} eating, you must have your paws tied behind you, and <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> back, so that I can pour it into your mouth.' ...|$|E
6000|$|When I {{came back}} {{he looked at}} me carefully, and then said, [...] "You are not much the worse. Go into the room, and <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> sofa, and rest awhile, then have much breakfast and come here to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] {{continued}} he, on {{observing that}} they did not seem cheered by the prospect, [...] "our road to the hunting-plain <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> way to Antananarivo, so you won't lose time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There! there!" [...] Father Anselm said impatiently; [...] "enough, {{and more}} than enough talk. Go to the door, Sir Archibald, and prepare to open it {{directly}} I have blown out the light. The way up the stairs <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> right hand as you go out." ...|$|R
5000|$|And {{when you}} have {{completed}} them, <b>lie</b> again <b>on</b> <b>your</b> right side; ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't mean {{to go if}} I {{can help}} it," [...] Jack said. [...] "Of course I could not swim with you two, but if you would <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> back quiet I might manage to keep you up for a bit anyhow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Who {{should know}} that better than you?' {{answered}} the Oreads. 'Us did he ever pass by, but you he sought for, and would <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> banks and look down at you, and in the mirror of your waters he would mirror his own beauty.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm all burning up, {{and my head}} is SO funny. I don't {{want any}} tea. I want to <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> sofa {{and go to sleep}} again. Can I?" [...] asked Rosy, with a dizzy look about the room, and a shiver at the idea of eating.|$|E
5000|$|... "I've spent {{shall we}} say {{about a third of}} my life in semi-darkness. The face now. You went in the morning and it was very very low. Some seams here were just about two feet. Well, you were <b>on</b> <b>your</b> knees or {{sometimes}} <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> back or sideways, and you were jolly glad to get your legs stretched a bit." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "They are {{kings of}} romance (an {{important}} part of the New Pop brewing around the UK)... There is something almost subversive about their odd mix of influences (The Smiths/’60s girl groups/’50s rock and roll)... It’s the romance of the Seine, of walking in the Peaks; or <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> back reading and daydreaming".|$|R
6000|$|The dust of {{the desert}} <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> hair and your feet are {{scratched}} with thorns and your body is scorched by the sun. Come with me, Honorius, and I will clothe you in a tunic of silk. I will smear your body with myrrh and pour spikenard <b>on</b> <b>your</b> hair. I will clothe you in hyacinth and put honey in your mouth. Love - ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Spend it!" [...] he repeated. [...] "What {{is there}} to spend it on? Uncomfortable clothes, false plays, drinks that are bad for you, food that's half poisoned, {{atmosphere}} that stifles. My God, Pritchard, {{is there anything in}} the world like this! Stretch out your arms, man. <b>Lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> back, look up at the stars, let that wind blow over your face. Listen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{trick is}} {{to die in the}} jacket, to will {{yourself}} to die. I know you don't get me yet, but wait. You know how you get numb in the jacket--how your arm or your leg goes to sleep. Now you can't help that, but you can take it for the idea and improve on it. Don't wait for your legs or anything to go to sleep. You <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> back as comfortable as you can get, and you begin to use your will.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I can see {{the marks}} of it upon ye constantly," [...] said Alan. [...] "But that's the strange thing about you folk of the college learning: ye're ignorant, and ye canna see't. Wae's me for my Greek and Hebrew; but, man, I ken that I dinna ken them--there's the differ of it. Now, here's you. Ye <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> wame a bittie in the bield of this wood, and ye tell me that ye've cuist off these Frasers and Macgregors. Why! Because I couldna see them, says you. Ye blockhead, that's their livelihood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And thence," [...] she said, [...] "I must fare {{into the}} town, for I {{have promised to}} visit a damsel of my friends, one Heliote Poulvoir, if I may find my way thither. Know you, gentle damsel," [...] she said to me, [...] "where she abides? Or perchance you can lead me thither, if it <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, how can {{you tell}} such fibs? Why, that last book by Lady What's-her-name which came in the Mudie box--the one they say is so improper--has been <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> table for over two months, and you can't tell me yet what it was the heroine did wrong. Morris, you are not inventing {{anything}} more, are you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, it was {{thinking}} of what you call consequences, Ellen, that prevented me from putting the matter, at once, to yonder red-devil, and making it a real knock-down and drag-out! Old trapper, the sin of this cowardly business <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> shoulders! But {{it is no more}} than your daily calling, I reckon, to take men, as well as beasts, in snares." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, ye donnered auld runt, {{how else}} would I ken?" [...] cried Alan. [...] "Hoseason and me are partners; we gang shares; so ye {{can see for}} yoursel' what good ye can do leeing. And I must plainly say ye drove a fool's bargain when ye let a man like the sailor-man so far forward in your private matters. But that's past praying for; and ye must <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> bed the way ye made it. And the point in hand is just this: what did ye pay him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are going}} to die as befits your kind," [...] said Tarzan, [...] "with blood on your hands and a <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> lips." [...] He started across the room toward the burly Hauptmann. Schneider was a large and {{powerful}} man--about the height of the ape-man but much heavier. He saw that neither threats nor pleas would avail him and so he prepared to fight as a cornered rat fights for its life with all the maniacal rage, cunning, and ferocity that the first law of nature imparts to many beasts.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is false!--it is a {{base and}} cowardly lie!" [...] exclaimed she (for the young lady's courage was up),--"Pierre {{never could have}} {{forgotten}} himself and me so as to offer me to one like you. You come here with a <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> lips--a lie against my father, to swear his life away, against my dear cousin's honor and love. It is useless now to deny it: father, I love Pierre Ancel; I will marry no other but him--no, though our last penny were paid to this man {{as the price of}} our freedom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Julien," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "what {{else could}} any one do? I heard the row and,--shall I admit it?--peeped through the keyhole. I couldn't see anything, so I {{opened the door}} softly and heard {{something}} {{of what was going}} on. This old revolver was <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> dressing-table, but I had an awful hunt for the cartridges. Whoever were those men?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We feel ourselves," [...] Bright {{continued}} unctuously, [...] "justified {{in using}} this tube, because its first {{results will be}} to throw you into a delirium, {{in the course of}} which we trust that you will divulge the hiding place of the stolen packet. We use this means {{in the interests of the}} country, and such risk as there may be <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> own head." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And you awoke, {{and found}} you were <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> back, or {{with your head}} hanging over the bedside, or {{suffering}} some pain from indigestion?' said Ralph. 'Pshaw, Mr Bray! Do as I do (you will have the opportunity, now that a constant round of pleasure and enjoyment opens upon you), and, occupying yourself a little more by day, {{have no time to}} think of what you dream by night.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do take shame;--and I do say it. Sir, do you {{not feel}} what you owe me? Do you not {{know that you have}} made me the wretch I am? How did you dare to talk to me as you did talk when you were in London? You tell me that I am Lady Mabel Grex;--and yet you come to me with a <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> lips,--with such a lie as that! You must have taken me for some nursemaid on whom you had condescended to cast your eye! It cannot be that even you should have dared to treat Lady Mabel Grex after such a fashion as that! And now you have cast your eye on this other girl. You can never marry her!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You do her injustice, brother. Lucy has {{not seen}} me, since the great change that I can myself see has come over me. Another time, I will tell you all. At present I can only say, {{that as soon as}} I had certain {{explanations}} with Rupert, I left town, and have studiously concealed from dear Lucy the state of my declining health. I write to her weekly, and get answers; everything passing between us as cheerfully, and apparently, as happily as ever. No, do not blame Lucy; who, I am certain, would quit everything and everybody to come to me, had she the smallest notion of the truth. On the contrary, I believe she thinks I would rather not have her at Clawbonny, just at this moment, much as she knows I love her; for, one of Lucy's observation and opportunities cannot but suspect the truth. Let me <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> breast, brother; it wearies me to talk so much." ...|$|E
60|$|Then a {{reporter}} leaped aboard, and ere I could gasp held {{me in his}} toils. He pumped me exhaustively while I was getting ashore, demanding of all {{things in the world}} news about Indian journalism. It is an awful thing to enter a new land with a new <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> lips. I spoke the truth to the evil-minded Custom House man who turned my most sacred raiment on a floor composed of stable refuse and pine splinters; but the reporter overwhelmed me not so much by his poignant audacity as his beautiful ignorance. I am sorry now that I did not tell him more lies as I passed into a city of three hundred thousand white men. Think of it! Three hundred thousand white men and women gathered in one spot, walking upon real pavements in front of plate-glass-windowed shops, and talking something that at first hearing was not very different from English. It was only when I had tangled myself up in a hopeless maze of small wooden houses, dust, street refuse, and children who played with empty kerosene tins, that I discovered the difference of speech.|$|E
60|$|KATHERINE. Do you {{remember}} that day on our honeymoon, going up Ben Lawers? You were <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> face in the heather; {{you said it was}} like kissing a loved woman. There was a lark singing--you said that was the voice of one's worship. The hills were very blue; that's why we had blue here, because it was the best dress of our country. You do love her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{the people}} {{may very well}} say 'save me from my friends'," [...] Fardell answered, grimly. [...] "Mind, I believe you're honest, or you'd be <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> back now with a cracked skull. But you are using a great {{influence}} on the wrong side. You're standing between {{the people and the}} one reasonable scheme which has been brought forward which has a fair chance of changing their condition." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely," [...] {{she went}} on, with a changed and {{softened}} manner, [...] "surely {{you will not}} do this wickedness. The blood of Dirk van Goorl <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> head; will you add mine to his? For be sure of this, I swear it by my Maker, that before I am indeed a wife to you I shall be dead--or mayhap you will be dead, or both of us. Do you understand?" ...|$|R
