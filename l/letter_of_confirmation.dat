25|$|In 1938, the world's top {{eight players}} {{met in the}} Netherlands {{to compete in the}} AVRO tournament, whose winner was {{supposed}} to get a title match with the World Champion, Alexander Alekhine. Botvinnik placed third, behind Paul Keres and Reuben Fine. According to Botvinnik, Alekhine was most interested in playing an opponent who could raise the funds. After consulting the nearest available Soviet officials, Botvinnik discreetly challenged Alekhine, who promptly accepted, subject to conditions that would enable him to acclimatize in Russia and get some high-quality competitive practice a few months before the match. In Botvinnik's opinion, Alekhine was partly motivated by the desire for a reconciliation with the Soviet authorities, so that he could again visit his homeland. The match, including funding, was authorised at the highest Soviet political level in January 1939; however, a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>confirmation</b> was only sent two months later – in Botvinnik's opinion, because of opposition by his Soviet rivals, especially those who had become prominent before the Russian Revolution – and the outbreak of World War II prevented a World Championship match.|$|E

The papal nuncio delayed his process and directed his agents in the Vatican to influence Sagrada Família's confirmation blocked or repealed. Although his efforts were eventually unsuccessful, four uncertain years passed, during which time the post remained vacant, even as the bishop was present on the island. Finally, on 12 July 1816, the long-awaited apostolic <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>confirmation</b> were issued, but still arrived in Angra without the royal Exequatur that normally accompanied these documents.

It did not, however, end the struggle, as King William still objected, and in 1186 both John and Hugh were summoned to Rome once more.

5000|$|The UN {{followed}} {{the practice of}} the Peace Conference of Paris and the League of Nations regarding the creation of states. Religious and minority rights were placed under the protection of the United Nations and recognition of the new states was conditioned upon acceptance of a constitutional plan of legal protections. Israel acknowledged that obligation, and Israel's declaration of independence stated that the State of Israel would ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex, and guaranteed freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture. In the hearings before the Ad Hoc Political Committee that considered Israel's application for membership in the United Nations, Abba Eban said that the rights stipulated in section C. Declaration, chapters 1 and 2 of UN resolution 181(II) had been constitutionally embodied as the fundamental law of the state of Israel as required by the resolution. The instruments that he cited were the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel, and various cables and <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>confirmation</b> addressed to the Secretary General.

40|$|Abstract Background Parts of New Public Management-reforms of {{the public}} sector depend on {{introduction}} of market-like mechanisms to manage the sector, like free choice of hospital. However, patients may delegate the choice of hospital to agents like general practitioners (GPs). We have investigated which factors Danish GPs reported as decisive for their choice of hospital on behalf of patients, and their utilisation of formal and informal data sources when they chose a hospital on behalf of patients. Methods Retrospective questionnaire study of all of the 474 GPs practising in three counties which constituted a single uptake area. Patients were free to choose a hospital in another county in the country. The GPs were asked about responsibility for choice of the latest three patients referred by the GP to hospital; which of 16 factors influenced the choice of hospital; which of 15 sources of information about clinical quality at various hospitals/departments were considered relevant, and how often were six sources of information about waiting time utilised. Results Fifty-one percent (240 GPs) filled in and returned the questionnaire. One hundred and eighty-three GPs (76 %) reported that they perceived that they chose the hospital on behalf of the latest referred patient. Short distance to hospital was the most common reason for choice of hospital. The most frequently used source of information about quality at hospital departments was anecdotal reports from patients referred previously, and the most important source of information about waiting time was the hospitals’ <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> referrals. Conclusions In an area with free choice of public hospital most GPs perceived that they chose the hospital on behalf of patients. Short distance to hospital was the factor which most often decided the GPs’ choice of hospital on behalf of patients. GPs attached little weight to official information on quality and service (waiting time) at hospitals or departments, focusing instead on informal sources like feedback from patients and colleagues and their experience with cooperation with the department or hospital. </p...|$|R

5000|$|A side issue {{over the}} {{statements}} of Pope Honorius I and his condemnation by the council arose in discussions concerning papal infallibility. In the view of historians such as John Bagnell Bury, Honorius, with a traditional Latin dislike for dialectics, did not fully comprehend the issues. The question of Monoenergism, as presented by Patriarch Sergius, seemed to Honorius {{to be a matter}} of grammar rather than theology. Though he used the expression [...] "one will", he was no Monothelite, for he placed [...] "one energy" [...] and [...] "two energies" [...] on exactly the same footing. Further, in his second letter to Sergius, what he wrote was by and large orthodox. Maximus the Confessor, in his Disputation with Pyrrhus, interprets the statement [...] "one will" [...] as referring the integrity of Christ's human will, in contrast to the fallen human will which seeks diverse and contradictory goods. The Third Council of Constantinople posthumously anathematized Honorius as a heretic: [...] "And with these we define that there shall be expelled from the holy Church of God and anathematized Honorius who was some time Pope of Old Rome, because of what we found written by him to Sergius, that in all respects he followed his view and confirmed his impious doctrines" [...] (13th session) and [...] "To Honorius, the heretic, anathema!" [...] (16th session). However, Pope Leo II's <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>confirmation</b> of the Council interprets the council as intending to criticize Honorius not for error of belief, but rather for [...] "imprudent economy of silence". Leo's letter states: [...] "We anathematize the inventors of the new error, that is, Theodore, Sergius, ... and also Honorius, who did not attempt to sanctify this Apostolic Church with the teaching of Apostolic tradition, but by profane treachery permitted its purity to be polluted." ...|$|E
40|$|The Szeged {{manifesto}} had {{not been}} issued on August 4, 1444 as is generally accepted based on {{the date of the}} document given by Długosz. It was produced a few days later and antedated in an effort to conceal the issuance of another document on August 4, namely the <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>confirmation</b> by the king of the peace treaty with Turkey. The above conclusion is supported by the explanation of an error in the date of the letter of John VIII Palaiologos to the king of Hungary made during its translation from Greek into Latin. Because of its date July 30, 1444 quoted by Długosz it has been assumed that the letter must have arrived in Hungary after the decision to resume the crusade was already made. In fact, the emperor’s letter {{played a crucial role in}} the decision of the king and the Hungarians to break the peace and go to war against Turkey in September 1444...|$|E
40|$|The Author {{discusses}} selected {{aspects of}} the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods of 1980. It came into force on 1 Jan. 1988, and has already been ratified by 30 states. Poland is not party to that Convention, yet {{taking into account the}} provisions of the Polish private international law it is highly probable that the provisions of the Convention will be "the proper law" for many sale contracts concluded by Polish companies with foreign partners. The Convention is considered by many international commercial law experts to be a carefully drafted and relatively modern legal act. However, the Author focuses his attention on some selected compromise solutions which may constitute a real danger for consistency of interpretation, and thus may be subject to criticism. In particular, the Author points to a scope of application of the Convention, to an excessively wide notion of the principle of the autonomy of the will, and to the reduction of the position of the bona fide principle {{to the role of the}} rule of interpretation. In the Author's opinion a weak point of the Convention is its silence on controversies debated in contemporary legal literature, such as the conclusion of contract by negotiations or the role <b>of</b> commercial <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>confirmation.</b> However, despite his criticism, the Author concludes that Poland should ratify the Convention without delay.

50|$|Usually, a {{political}} party will send out non-forwardable, first-class mail to voters or particular voters they want to target (often {{assumed to be a}} demographic that belongs to the opposing party). It will compile a list of voters for whom mail has been returned as undeliverable. The list is called a caging list.

The party uses caging lists created by themselves or by the Board of Elections to challenge the registration status of voters and potentially purge them from the voting rolls under state laws that allow voters whose registrations are suspect to be challenged.|$|R
