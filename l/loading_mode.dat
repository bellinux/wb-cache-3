5000|$|Flange-bearing frogs {{have been}} used by street {{railways}} for more than 100 years as a means of reducing noise pollution in populated urban settings. In 1995, Robert Willow filed a patent in the United States adapting this concept for use in mainline freight and passenger service. The patent describes the technology as, [...] "designed to support a railroad wheel to roll through the frog on its flange rather than requiring its tread to jump across a flangeway gap." [...] Ramps are placed {{on either side of the}} frog to gradually transition the wheel load from the tread (known as tread-bearing <b>loading</b> <b>mode)</b> to the flange (known as flange-bearing <b>loading</b> <b>mode)</b> and to lift the wheel so that the tread is completely clear of the rail.|$|E

Because of {{widespread use of}} HVDC, DC/AC system become more complex than before and the present modes used in dispatch and planning departments are not fit in simulation anymore. So {{it is necessary to}} find <b>load</b> <b>modes</b> accurately reflecting characteristics of the system. For the sake of the voltage stability, commutation failure, etc. the practical example of the receiving network in a large DC/AC system in China is simulated with BPA, and the influence of Classical <b>Load</b> <b>Mode</b> (CLM) and Synthesis load model (SLM) on simulation results is studies. Furthermore, some important parameters of SLM are varied respectively among an interval to analyse how they affect the system. According to this practical examples, the result is closely related to <b>load</b> <b>modes</b> and their parameters, and SLM is more conservative but more reasonable than the present modes. The consequences indicate that at critical states, micro variation in parameters may give rise to change in simulation results radically. Thus, correct mode and parameters are important to enhance simulation accuracy of DC/AC system and researches on how they affect the system make senses...|$|R

A Traditional Battery Management System (BMS) only includes battery-aware task scheduling based on the discharge characteristics of a whole battery pack and do {{not take into account}} the <b>mode</b> of the <b>load</b> being served by the battery.

This paper comparatively analyzes the discharging behavior of batteries at an individual cell level for different <b>load</b> <b>modes.</b> The difference in discharging behavior from mode to mode represents the study of the mode-dependent behavior of the battery before its deployment in some application.

40|$|Tho-point bending is {{a useful}} method for {{investigating}} the mechanical properties of optical fiber and has several advantages {{when compared to the}} traditional tensile test. However, the strength of the fiber is usually determined at constant faceplate velocity rather than at constant strain rate as in the uniaxial tensile test, and previous work casts doubt on the comparability of fatigue results obtained using different <b>loading</b> <b>modes</b> and hence on the reliability of the bending technique. This paper presents dynamic fatigue results using a two-point bend apparatus that can be pro-grammed to operate in constant velocity, constant strain rate, and constant stress rate <b>loading</b> <b>modes.</b> These results, obtained for both bare and polymer-coated fused silica opti-cal fiber, show no significant differences in the calculated fatigue parameters for the three <b>loading</b> <b>modes</b> and clearly indicate the reliability of the two-point bend method at con-stant faceplate velocity.

40|$|AbstractThe {{main purpose}} of the {{research}} presented herein was to study the fatigue crack propagation under <b>loading</b> <b>modes</b> I, II or III, either for plane strain or plain stress state. Therefore, several finite element analyses (FEA) were carried out and some experimental tests were performed in a bi-axial servo-hydraulic machine. J-integral values were determined through numerical simulations and stress intensity factors, KI, KII and KIII were inferred at the crack tip of both thick and thin C(T) specimens, assuming several crack’s lengths, and either for plane strain or plane stress state. Load opening-mode I shown to be the predominant mode of crack propagation under plane-strain state, leading to the highest J-integral values calculated, followed by Mode III. In addition, shearing <b>load</b> (<b>mode</b> II) induced the lowest stress intensity factor values at the crack tip both for plane stress state and for plane strain state. Finally, some fatigue crack growth rates (FCG) were determined under <b>loading</b> <b>modes</b> I or III, for thin specimens, at room temperature. C(T) specimens used in the experimental tests were made of two austenitic stainless steels, namely the AISI 316 L and the Cr-Mn stainless steel, which are commonly used in several specific engineering applications.

Examples from plant, offshore, transportation and automotive engineering show how these parameters influence the fatigue life and to what extent they are considered in design codes. Especially, under spectrum loading, the stress decreasing effect of tensile residual stresses is not as high as under constant amplitude loading; this knowledge benefits light weight design. The overloads harmed only the low strength joints under pulsating bending. In all other cases investigated, with low, medium and high-strength steels, a significant decrease of fatigue life was not observed; on the contrary, significant improvement of fatigue life could even be observed.
