5|$|Plant recolonization and {{succession}} {{has occurred}} in Glacier Bay {{as a result of}} the retreat of the glacier bay in the last about 300 years. The succession, which occurred in the new wilderness of Glacier Bay was stated to be a raw landscape. A simile given is that “It was <b>like</b> <b>seeing</b> an owl with no feathers”. A vegetative wilderness has been created, which has resulted in the coastal forest. 333 Vascular plant species of individual taxa have been recorded in the Glacier Bay. Dense thickets of Sitka alder and devil's club abound along the shoreline.|$|E
25|$|A mild form of {{hallucination}} {{is known}} as a disturbance, and can occur in most of the senses above. These may be things <b>like</b> <b>seeing</b> movement in peripheral vision, or hearing faint noises and/or voices. Auditory hallucinations are very common in schizophrenia. They may be benevolent (telling the subject good things about themselves) or malicious, cursing the subject, etc. Auditory hallucinations of the malicious type are frequently heard, for example people talking about the subject behind his/her back. Like auditory hallucinations, the source of the visual counterpart can also be behind the subject's back. Their visual counterpart is the feeling of being looked or stared at, usually with malicious intent. Frequently, auditory hallucinations and their visual counterpart are experienced by the subject together.|$|E

500|$|Initially titled [...] "The Clone Wars", the episode's {{title was}} later changed to [...] "Attack of Mark's Clone". Series {{developer}} David M. Stern wrote the episode with Adam Stein, and Richard Ferguson-Hull and series creator Devin Clark directed it. Stein and Mick Kelly served as staff writers. In {{an interview with}} Kevin Fitzpatrick of UGO, Clark spoke of the episode and proclaimed {{that it was a}} [...] "really fun opportunity" [...] to see what Mark's clone would be like, calling him an [...] "Agro-Mark". He said that Matt Oberg, the voice of Mark, voiced the clone as a [...] "much more gruff individual". Clark elaborated, [...] "It's really funny. It's <b>like</b> <b>seeing</b> Mark, since we kind of play him so neutered most of the time, it's <b>like</b> <b>seeing</b> him as like this jerk, it's hilarious, it's a very funny story." [...] Executive producer Daniel Powell said that Clone Mark [...] "glove slaps everyone [...] a cigarette instead of putting it out before the office". [...] "Attack of Mark's Clone" [...] was the eighth episode to be produced for the second season. In addition to the regular cast, the episode features appearances by recurring guest voice actors Pete Holmes and Mike O'Gorman. Comedians Kate McKinnon and Jay Oakerson guest starred in the episode.|$|E

Brown experienced sexual abuse from a camp counselor who threatened to kill the 10-year-old boy if he told anyone– {{which he did not}} disclose, even to his family, until his autobiography Against All Odds (2011)– and physical abuse from his stepfathers. During various periods of his childhood, Brown lived with his grandparents and his aunt. He shoplifted many times, and was arrested for stealing record albums and brought before Judge Samuel Zoll in Salem, Massachusetts at the age of 12. Zoll asked Brown if his siblings would <b>like</b> <b>seeing</b> him play basketball in jail and required Brown to write a 1,500-word essay on that question as his punishment. Brown later said, [...] "that was the last time I ever stole." ...|$|E

In newspapers, however, Dunn never approached Tracy's popularity. The strip's successor writer, Allen Saunders, believed the comic rivaled Dick Tracy in pioneering themes and techniques of the American detective comic.|$|R

500|$|Impressed by {{her work}} in Dick, the screenwriter Charlie Kaufman cast Williams in his directorial debut Synecdoche, New York, {{alongside}} Philip Seymour Hoffman and Emily Watson. A box office bomb, it was praised in the media, appearing on many top ten critics' lists for 2008. Wendy and Lucy, an acclaimed small-budget, low-key drama directed and co-written by Kelly Reichardt, follows Wendy, a drifter looking {{to start a new}} life, searching for her dog Lucy after a series of setbacks. Unlike others, including the director, Williams did not find the film depressing. [...] "Personally I <b>like</b> <b>seeing</b> those kinds of movies. I find them comforting because they make me feel less alone." [...] As the lead actress of Wendy and Lucy, she enjoyed the documentary style of the film. Houston Chronicle writer Amy Biancolli said her performance, [...] "a bare-bones accomplishment of no small heft," [...] was the [...] movie's key. The Toronto Film Critics Association Awards named Williams as the Best Actress, and the film as 2008's Best Movie.|$|E
500|$|In a {{separate}} review for the song, Levine rated it {{three out of}} five stars, and wrote [...] "in spite of its predictability, 'I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time' still makes for a satisfying listen, sounding classy, effortless and as summery as a glass of rosé in the garden after a work." [...] Journalist for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK), Svein Terje Torvik described the song as [...] "One of the album's best cuts", while Fox News writer Roger Friedman wrote [...] "its just enough of a new twist to create the most elusive thing of all: a radio smash. Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine chose the song {{as one of his}} [...] "top picks" [...] from E=MC², and wrote [...] "it has a lightness that so much of the album lacks." [...] Richard Cromelin from the Los Angeles Times highlighted Carey's unadorned and raw form of singing in the song, writing [...] "her singing is so direct, understated and unglamorous it's almost shocking -- <b>like</b> <b>seeing</b> a diva without makeup." [...] Margeauz Watsman from Entertainment Weekly called the song a [...] "dance-floor anthem", while PopMatters Evan Sawdey described it as [...] "certainly worthy of some greatest-hits canonization". Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani felt [...] "I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time" [...] was a [...] "stroke of genius", and wrote [...] " [...] sounds like a hyperventilating cross between a graduation anthem and an early-'80s family sitcom theme song. Listening to it, I felt {{face to face with a}} couple of silver spoons: one heroin, the other grape jelly." ...|$|E
500|$|Comparing Jack's {{relationship}} with Ianto to his romantic tension with Gwen, David-Lloyd states [...] "I think [...] different sorts of love or lust, {{as it might}} be, and I think that's an ongoing thing ... At the moment, I think there's two different sorts of love going on there." [...] He also states that he feels that Ianto's {{relationship with}} Jack is his first same-sex relationship, and doesn't feel that Ianto would be a [...] "labelist", but were he, he would identify as bisexual, but that he [...] "wouldn't regard himself {{the same way as}} Jack does because they're from different times." [...] Author Stephen James Walker feels sorry for Ianto, perceiving his relationship with Jack as a one-sided one. To him, Ianto views the relationship as [...] "serious and committed", as seen in [...] "A Day in the Death" [...] where he tells Owen that it is not just about sex. However, from dialogue in [...] "Something Borrowed", Walker believes that Jack appears to equate his relationship with Ianto to nothing more than a [...] "recreational activity". Walker also notes how important it was for Ianto when he cut in to dance with Jack, as {{this is the first time}} that his relationship with Jack is presented before the rest of the crew. The novel The House that Jack Built includes a scene where Gwen tries to clarify whether Ianto understands the nature of his relationship with Jack, saying [...] "You do know he's ...", which Ianto finishes [...] "Just a shag?" [...] before adding [...] "Yes I know. I can't help it, though. I've never been much good at casual." [...] In radio play [...] "The Dead Line", set just prior to series three, Ianto expounds his insecurities to Jack, who refutes them, confirming that his feelings for Ianto are real. When asked if the relationship will continue in series three, executive producer Julie Gardner replied, [...] "Yes, I <b>like</b> <b>seeing</b> them as a couple", while director Euros Lyn stated that [...] "the love story between Captain Jack and Ianto [...] to unfold" [...] in the third series. While Gareth David-Lloyd feels that the love story between Jack and Ianto was not fully resolved, which is [...] "part of the tragedy", the character and his relationship with Jack had been sufficiently explored in the third series for David-Lloyd to be [...] "happy to walk away from it." ...|$|E

They could not feel Titian's noble color, nor Veronese's noble composition; but they thought it highly amusing to see the sun brought into a picture: and Claude's works were bought and delighted in by vulgar people then, for their real-looking suns, as pictures are now by vulgar people for having real timepieces in their church towers.|$|R

Once they took control of the aircraft, the hijackers forced women with uncovered heads, including the cabin crew members, to cover their heads. Women who did not have veils used aircraft blankets to cover their heads. An elderly Algerian man told the TF1 network that the hijackers [...] "had a kind of art in their terror.

Uchisawa thought that some plot developments were too [...] "out there", and Ashida noted that the game's occult feeling might be divisive. Ashida found the divination séance system to be a fresh addition to the gameplay, but also felt that it was [...] "stretching it"; Uchisawa disagreed, finding the game to not feel fresh, but still thought that the game was fun.|$|R
2500|$|Rowling cites Jane Austen as her {{favourite}} {{author and}} a major influence.

It gave one a curious feeling; <b>like</b> <b>seeing</b> a drunken stranger wrapped in one's dressing gown.'"

Esau suggested that Jacob and he travel together, but Jacob asked that Esau allow Jacob's party to travel more slowly, so as not to tax the young children and the flocks, until they came to Esau in Seir. Esau offered to leave some of his men behind with Jacob, but Jacob declined.

In early revisions, various songs, including [...] "The Status Quo" [...] and [...] "Velma’s Cha-Cha" [...] (its short reprise replaced by “Rage,” in turn dropped in favor of “Velma’s Revenge”), were used during Tracy’s audition and dismissal, but the team instead opted for [...] "(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs", as the audience did not <b>like</b> <b>seeing</b> Tracy being verbally attacked after [...] "I Can Hear the Bells". After the auditions, there was a scene in the Har-De-Har Hut in which Wilbur tried to cheer up Tracy after her rejection, singing that [...] "It Doesn't Get Better than This".
