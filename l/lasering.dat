40|$|The current {{techniques}} in {{minimally invasive surgery}} allow treating fetal disorders. Treatment in an earlier stage increases the chance or level of recovery. However, fetal interventions require precise instrument manipulation from the surgeon. For instance, {{in the treatment of}} the twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) the surgeon needs to bring a laser in close vicinity to the placenta. It is crucial that the surgeon maintains a specific distance between the tip of the employed instrument and the placenta, while <b>lasering</b> target sites on the placental surface. To facilitate this procedure, we suggest a new approach where the surgeon comanipulates the instruments together with a robotic stabilizer arm. The stabilizer arm provides haptic guidance to the surgeon, augmenting the surgeon's precision and helping him maintain a desired <b>lasering</b> distance.

40|$|AbstractBeside {{the total}} <b>laser</b> power, the <b>laser</b> beam {{diameter}} {{is a significant}} factor for the resistance of <b>laser</b> protection filters to <b>laser</b> radiation. In this paper {{a study of the}} resistance of <b>laser</b> protection filters to <b>laser</b> radiation in dependence of the <b>laser</b> beam diameter is given. For the investigation of this effect an experimental setup is realized, which detects <b>laser</b> radiation near the MPE value (ref. 1) (Maximum Permissible Exposure; level of <b>laser</b> radiation to which, under normal circumstances, persons may be exposed without suffering adverse effects) behind the filter glasses, which is taken as a criteria for the failure of <b>laser</b> protection filters. This failure defines the <b>laser</b> resistance time of the protection filter under the given <b>laser</b> parameters (<b>laser</b> power and <b>laser</b> beam diameter). The experiments involve a series of irradiations from a cw (continuous wave) Nd:YAG <b>laser</b> (wavelength 1064 nm) with the variation of <b>laser</b> power, <b>laser</b> beam diameter and with different material thicknesses. The dependency of the <b>laser</b> resistance time follows a power function of the <b>laser</b> beam diameter. It is shown that by performing only a few dedicated <b>laser</b> resistance tests for a specific type of <b>laser</b> protection filter, it is possible to calculate the <b>laser</b> resistance time for different <b>laser</b> beam diameters occurring in practical lab situations...|$|R

40|$|In adult albino mice {{the effects}} of {{increased}} intraocular pressure on the outer retina and its circuitry was investigated at intervals ranging 3 – 14 weeks. Ocular hypertension (OHT) was induced by cauterizing the vessels draining the anterior part of the mice eye, as recently reported (Salinas-Navarro et al., 2009 a). Electroretinographic (ERG) responses were recorded simultaneously from both eyes and compared each other prior to and at different survival intervals of 2, 8 or 12 weeks after <b>lasering.</b> Animals were processed at 3, 9 or 14 weeks after <b>lasering,</b> and radial sections were obtained in the cryostat and further processed for immunocytochemistry using antibodies against recoverin, γ-transducin, Protein Kinase C-α (PKC-α), calbindin or synaptophysin. The synaptic ribbons were identified using an antibody against the protein bassoon, which labels photoreceptor ribbons and nuclei were identified using TO-PRO. Laser photocoagulation of the perilimbar and episcleral veins of the left eye resulted {{in an increase in}} mean intraocular pressure to approximately over twice its baseline by 24 h that was maintained for approximately five days reaching basal levels by 1 week. ERG recordings from the different groups of mice showed their a-, b-wave and scotopic threshold response (STR) amplitudes, when compared to their contralateral fellow eye, reduced to 62 %, 52 % and 23 % at 12 weeks after <b>lasering.</b> Three weeks after <b>lasering,</b> immunostaining with recoverin and transducin antibodies could not document any changes in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) but both ON-rod bipolar and horizontal cells had lost their dendritic processes in the outer plexiform layer (OPL). Sprouting of horizontal and bipolar cell processes were observed into the ONL. Fourteen weeks after <b>lasering,</b> protein kinase-C antibodies showed morphologic changes of ON-rod bipolar cells and calbindin staining showed abnormal horizontal cells and a loss of their relationship with their presynaptic input. Moreover, at this time, quantitative studies indicate significant diminutions in the number of photoreceptor synaptic ribbons/ 100 μm, and in the thickness of the outer nuclear and plexiform layer, when compared to their fellow eyes. Increased intraocular pressure in Swiss mice results in permanent alterations of their full field ERG responses and in changes of the inner and outer retinal circuitries.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of 196 eyes from 103 patients who underwent neodymium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser iridotomy performed by resident physicians from January 1, 2010 through April 30, 2015 at a university-based county hospital was done. All patients were treated for primary angle closure, primary angle closure suspects, and primary angle closure glaucoma. Data {{were collected on}} pre- and post-laser intraocular pressure (IOP), ethnicity, laser parameters and complications. Mean power use and frequency of complications were evaluated. Complications included elevated post-laser IOP at 30 – 45 minutes (≥ 8 mmHg), hyphema, aborted procedures, and <b>lasering</b> non-iris structures. The number of repeated LPI procedures, was also recorded. Results: Mean total power used for all residents was 78. 2 ± 68. 7 mJ per eye. Power use by first-year trainees {{was significantly higher than}} second- and third-year trainees (103. 5 ± 75. 5 mJ versus 73. 7 ± 73. 8 mJ and 67. 2 ± 56. 4 mJ, respectively, p= 0. 011). Complications included hyphema or microhyphema in 17. 9 % (35 / 196), IOP spikes in 5. 1 % (10 / 196), aborted procedures in 1. 1 % (3 / 196) and <b>lasering</b> non-iris structures in 0. 5 % (1 / 196). LPI was repeated in 22. 4 % of cases (44 / 196) with higher incidence of repeat LPI among non-Caucasian compared to the Caucasian subjects (p= 0. 02).
