5|$|Gilliam {{originally}} {{believed that}} Pitt {{was not right}} {{for the role of}} Jeffrey Goines, but the casting director convinced him otherwise. Pitt was cast for a comparatively small salary, as he was still relatively unknown at the time. By the time of 12 Monkeys release, however, Interview with the Vampire (1994), <b>Legends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fall (1994), and Se7en (1995) had been released, making Pitt an A-list actor, which drew greater attention to the film and boosted its box-office standing. In Philadelphia, months before filming, Pitt spent weeks at Temple University's hospital, visiting and studying the psychiatric ward to prepare for his role.|$|E

5|$|Gregory {{was born}} at Roxborough, County Galway, the {{youngest}} daughter of the Anglo-Irish gentry family Persse. Her mother, Frances Barry, was related to Viscount Guillamore, and her family home, Roxborough, was a 6,000-acre (24km²) estate located between Gort and Loughrea, the main house of which was later burnt down during the Irish Civil War. She was educated at home, and her future career was strongly influenced by the family nurse (i.e. nanny), Mary Sheridan, a Catholic and a native Irish speaker, who introduced the young Augusta to the history and <b>legends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local area.|$|E
5|$|Stela 8 is a well-preserved {{monument}} on {{the south}} side of Structure A-3. Here king Wat'ul Chatel wears jaguar claws on his hands and feet, together with other attributes of the Bearded Jaguar God. In one hand the king holds the head of the god K'awiil. The text describes a visitor named Hakawitzil, an early form of Jacawitz, the name of one of the patron gods of the Postclassic K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj in the Guatemalan Highlands. Schele and Mathews propose that the event depicted on this stela gave rise to the foundation <b>legends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> K'iche' people.|$|E

5|$|While Maud is {{described}} in the book as an attractive young woman, not a deformed monster, Uncle Silas is carefully written and plotted, and it is almost certain that Le Fanu explicitly intended a comparison between Maud's situation and {{the legend of the}} wealthy woman living in isolation and desired only for her money. Le Fanu spent his entire life in Dublin and was editor and proprietor of the Dublin University Magazine, and would certainly have been familiar with the <b>legends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pig-faced woman, and in particular the case of Griselda Steevens.|$|E
5|$|Although no fossil {{evidence}} has been dated within the last 1,000 years, the hippopotamus has been surprisingly common in the oral <b>legends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Malagasy. In 1648, Étienne de Flacourt became the French governor of Madagascar and {{he wrote in his}} Histoire de la grande isle de Madagascar about hearing stories from the Malagasy about an animal called the mangarsahoc which closely resembled the hippopotamus. In different regions of Madagascar, stories were recorded of the tsy-aomby-aomby, the omby-rano, and the laloumena, all animals that resembled hippopotami, but few other animals on the island. In 1902, a colonial administrator named Raybaud asserted that stories he heard in the highlands could only be about Malagasy hippos still living as late as 1878. The strength of these oral traditions led the IUCN to classify the Malagasy hippopotami as recent extinctions.|$|E

5|$|Himmler's {{personal}} masseur Felix Kersten {{claimed that}} the former even contemplated resettling the entire Dutch population, some 8 million people in total at the time, to agricultural lands in the Vistula and Bug River valleys of German-occupied Poland as {{the most efficient way}} of facilitating their immediate Germanization. In this eventuality he is alleged to have further hoped to establish an SS Province of Holland in vacated Dutch territory, and to distribute all confiscated Dutch property and real estate among reliable SS-men. However this claim was shown to be a myth by Loe de Jong in his book Two <b>Legends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Reich.|$|E
5|$|In {{many of the}} <b>legends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cascade Mountains, {{there are}} thunderbirds that live on them and Adams is no exception. This {{particular}} thunderbird was named Enumtla and he terrorized {{the inhabitants of the}} land. Speelyi, the Klickitat coyote god, came along one day and they implored him to do something. Speelyi transformed himself into a feather and waited. It did not take long for Enumtla to see the feather and investigate. Being suspicious, he thundered at the feather with no effect. He paused and suddenly the magic feather let loose a terrific volley of thunder and lightning and stunned Enumtla. Speelyi then managed to overpower Enumtla and decreed that the thunderbird could no longer terrify the people, could only thunder on hot days, and could not destroy with lightning.|$|E
5|$|Stoke City {{arranged}} a testimonial match {{in honour of}} Matthews; it was much needed as he {{had spent most of}} his career constricted to the tight maximum wage that had been enforced upon the English game.

Harry Johnston led out a team consisting of Bert Trautmann, Tim Ward, George Hardwick, Jimmy Hill, Neil Franklin, Don Revie, Stan Mortensen, Nat Lofthouse, Jimmy Hagan, Tom Finney and Frank Bowyer (reserve).
