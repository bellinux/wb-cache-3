5|$|The {{external}} morphology of <b>Lepidoptera</b> is {{the physiological}} {{structure of the}} bodies of insects belonging to the order <b>Lepidoptera,</b> also known as butterflies and moths. <b>Lepidoptera</b> are distinguished from other orders {{by the presence of}} scales on the external parts of the body and appendages, especially the wings. Butterflies and moths vary in size from microlepidoptera only a few millimetres long, to a wingspan of many inches such as the Atlas moth. Comprising over 160,000 described species, the <b>Lepidoptera</b> possess variations of the basic body structure which has evolved to gain advantages in adaptation and distribution.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies and moths {{are able}} to see ultra-violet (UV) light, and wing colours and {{patterns}} are principally observed by <b>Lepidoptera</b> in this region. The patterns seen on their wing under UV light differ considerably from those seen in normal light. The UV patterns act as visual cues which help differentiate between species {{for the purpose of}} mating. Studies have been carried out on <b>Lepidoptera</b> (mostly butterflies) wing patterns illuminated by UV light.|$|E

5|$|The {{red maple}} is a {{used as a}} food source by several forms of wildlife. Elk and white-tailed deer in {{particular}} use the current season's growth of red maple as {{an important source of}} winter food. Several <b>Lepidoptera</b> (butterflies and moths) utilize the leaves as food; see List of <b>Lepidoptera</b> that feed on maples.|$|E
5|$|This {{spectacular}} moth {{is considered}} one of the most impressive and beautiful <b>Lepidoptera,</b> rivalling almost any of the butterflies in brilliance of colouring and form. It is featured in most coffee table books on the <b>Lepidoptera,</b> and is much sought after by collectors. It is collected in the wild, and raised commercially for the international butterfly trade; its wings were used to make jewellery in the Victorian era.|$|E
5|$|While mandibles or 'jaws' (chewing mouthparts) {{are only}} {{present in the}} {{caterpillar}} stage, the mouthparts of most adult <b>Lepidoptera</b> mainly consist of the sucking kind; this part {{is known as the}} proboscis or 'haustellum'. A few <b>Lepidoptera</b> species have reduced mouthparts and therefore do not feed in the adult state. Others, such as the basal family Micropterigidae, have mouthparts of the chewing kind.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{providing}} the primary function of flight, wings also have secondary functions of self-defence, camouflage and thermoregulation. In some <b>Lepidoptera</b> families {{such as the}} Psychidae and Lymantriidae, the wings are reduced or even absent (often in the female but not the male).|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} other members of the {{superorder}} Holometabola, <b>Lepidoptera</b> undergo complete metamorphosis, going through a four-stage life cycle: egg, larva / caterpillar, pupa / chrysalis, and imago (plural:imagines) / adult.|$|E
5|$|In {{some species}} of <b>Lepidoptera,</b> a waxy layer is present inside the chorion {{adjacent}} to the vitelline layer which {{is thought to have}} evolved to prevent desiccation. In insects, the chorion has a layer of air-pores in the otherwise solid material which provides very limited capability for respiratory function. In <b>Lepidoptera,</b> the chorion layer above this air pore layer is lamellar with successive sheets of protein arranged in a particular direction and stepped so as to form a helical arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Insectes (Insects, inc. Myriapods): 1. Myriapodes, 2. Thysanoures (Thysanura), 3. Parasites, 4. Suceurs, 5. Coléoptères (Coleoptera), 6. Orthoptères (Orthoptera), 7. Hémiptères (Hemiptera), 8. Névroptères (Neuroptera), 9. Hyménoptères (Hymenoptera), 10. Lépidoptères (<b>Lepidoptera),</b> 11. Ripiptères (Strepsiptera), 12. Diptères (Diptera).|$|E
5|$|Larva: <b>Lepidoptera</b> larvae {{are known}} as caterpillars, and have a {{well-developed}} head and mandibles. They can have from zero to five pairs of prolegs, usually four.|$|E
5|$|Several highly {{successful}} insect groups—especially the Hymenoptera (wasps, bees and ants) and <b>Lepidoptera</b> (butterflies) {{as well as}} many types of Diptera (flies) and Coleoptera (beetles)—evolved in conjunction with flowering plants during the Cretaceous (145 to 66 million years ago). The earliest bees, important pollinators today, appeared in the early Cretaceous. A group of wasps sister to the bees evolved {{at the same time as}} flowering plants, as did the <b>Lepidoptera.</b> Further, all the major clades of bees first appeared between the middle and late Cretaceous, simultaneously with the adaptive radiation of the eudicots (three quarters of all angiosperms), and at the time when the angiosperms became the world's dominant plants on land.|$|E
5|$|The {{cladogram}} {{of external}} relationships, {{based on a}} 2008 DNA and protein analysis, shows the order as a clade, sister to the <b>Lepidoptera,</b> and more distantly related to the Diptera (true flies) and Mecoptera (scorpionflies).|$|E
5|$|The phylogenetic {{position}} of Diptera has been controversial. The monophyly of holometabolous insects {{has long been}} accepted, with the main orders being established as <b>Lepidoptera,</b> Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera, {{and it is the}} relationships between these groups which has caused difficulties. Diptera is widely thought {{to be a member of}} Mecopterida, along with <b>Lepidoptera</b> (butterflies and moths), Trichoptera (caddisflies), Siphonaptera (fleas), Mecoptera (scorpionflies) and possibly Strepsiptera (twisted-wing flies). Diptera has been grouped with Siphonaptera and Mecoptera in the Antliophora, but this has not been confirmed by molecular studies.|$|E
5|$|The pupae of most <b>Lepidoptera</b> are obtect, with {{appendages}} fused or {{glued to}} the body, while the rest have exarate pupae, having the antennae, legs, and wings free and not {{glued to the}} body.|$|E
5|$|While most insects {{have three}} simple eyes, or ocelli, only two ocelli {{are present in}} all species of <b>Lepidoptera,</b> except a few moths, {{one on each side}} of the head near the edge of the {{compound}} eye. On some species, sense organs called chaetosemata are found near the ocelli. The ocelli are not homologous to the simple eyes of caterpillars which are differently named as stemmata. The ocelli of <b>Lepidoptera</b> are reduced externally in some families; where present, they are unfocussed, unlike stemmata of larvae which are fully focussed. The utility of ocelli is not understood at present.|$|E
5|$|Abdominal {{segments}} 3–6 and 10 each bear {{a pair of}} {{legs that}} are more fleshy. The thoracic legs are known as true legs and the abdominal legs are called prolegs. The true legs vary little in the <b>Lepidoptera</b> except for reduction in certain leaf-miners and elongation in the family Notodontidae. The prolegs contain {{a number of small}} hooks on the tip, which are known as crochets. The families of <b>Lepidoptera</b> differ in the number and positioning of their prolegs. Some larvae such as inchworms (Geometridae) and loopers (Plusiinae) have five pairs of prolegs or less, while others like Lycaenidae and slug caterpillars (Limacodidae) lack prolegs altogether. In some leaf-mining caterpillars there are crochets present on the abdominal wall which are reduced prolegs, while other leaf-mining species lack the crochets entirely. The abdominal spiracles are located {{on each side of the}} body on the first eight abdominal segments.|$|E
5|$|Bees are {{themselves}} Müllerian mimics of other aposematic insects {{with the same}} colour scheme, including wasps, lycid and other beetles, and many butterflies and moths (<b>Lepidoptera)</b> which {{are themselves}} distasteful, often through acquiring bitter and poisonous chemicals from their plant food. All the Müllerian mimics, including bees, benefit from the reduced risk of predation that results from their easily recognised warning coloration.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{defense is}} another {{important}} defense found among species of Coleoptera and <b>Lepidoptera,</b> usually being advertised by bright colors, such as the monarch butterfly. They obtain their toxicity by sequestering the chemicals from the plants they eat into their own tissues. Some <b>Lepidoptera</b> manufacture their own toxins. Predators that eat poisonous butterflies and moths may become sick and vomit violently, learning not to eat those types of species; this is actually the basis of Müllerian mimicry. A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well. Some ground beetles of the Carabidae family can spray chemicals from their abdomen with great accuracy, to repel predators.|$|E
5|$|In summer, the {{dragonfly}} pond {{can hold}} up to ten species of dragonflies and damselflies. The nationally scarce moth flame wainscot has bred at Titchwell since 1996; other <b>Lepidoptera</b> may include migrants such as the painted lady, the diamondback moth, and especially the silver Y, which can occur in huge numbers; 90,000 were recorded on the reserve in July 2010, feeding on sea lavender.|$|E
5|$|RNAi has varying {{effects in}} {{different}} species of <b>Lepidoptera</b> (butterflies and moths). Possibly because their saliva and gut juice is better at breaking down RNA, the cotton bollworm, the beet armyworm and the Asiatic rice borer have {{so far not been}} proven susceptible to RNAi by feeding.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the oldest}} and most {{successful}} insect groups, such Endopterygota, use a system of complete metamorphosis. Complete metamorphosis is unique to a group of certain insect orders including Diptera, <b>Lepidoptera</b> and Hymenoptera. This form of development is exclusive and not seen in any other arthropods.|$|E
5|$|The book's list of {{contents}} reveals Thayer's {{heavy reliance on}} bird examples, filling 16 of the 27 chapters. Other vertebrates occupy 5 chapters. Insects receive 3 chapters, of which two are dedicated to <b>lepidoptera</b> - one to caterpillars, one to adult butterflies and moths; the remaining one devotes 14 pages to all other insects, starting with orthoptera including the leaf-mimic grasshoppers.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} <b>Lepidoptera</b> fossils {{are of a}} small moth, Archaeolepis mane, of Jurassic age, around 190 {{million years}} ago (mya). Butterflies evolved from moths, so while the butterflies are monophyletic (forming a single clade), the moths are not. The oldest butterflies are from the Palaeocene MoClay or Fur Formation of Denmark. The oldest American butterfly is the Late Eocene Prodryas persephone from the Florissant Fossil Beds.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphological}} {{characteristics of}} caterpillars and pupae used for classification are {{completely different from}} that of adults; different classification schemes are sometimes provided separately for classifying adults, larvae and pupae. The characteristics of immature stages are increasingly used for taxonomic purposes as they provide insights into systematics and phylogenies of <b>Lepidoptera</b> that are not apparent from examination of adults.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper and}} lower parts of the thorax (terga and sterna respectively) are {{composed}} of segmental and intrasegmental sclerites which display secondary sclerotisation and considerable modification in the <b>Lepidoptera.</b> The prothorax is the simplest and smallest of the three segments while the mesothorax is the most developed.|$|E
5|$|Adult <b>Lepidoptera</b> {{have two}} pairs of {{membranous}} wings covered, usually completely, by minute scales. A wing consists of an upper and lower membrane which are connected by minute fibres and strengthened by a system of thickened hollow ribs, popularly but incorrectly referred to as 'veins', as they may also contain tracheae, nerve fibres and blood vessels. The membranes are covered with minute scales which have jagged ends or hairs and are attached by hooks. The wings are moved by the rapid muscular contraction and expansion of the thorax.|$|E
5|$|As {{the wing}} develops, the dorsal and ventral integumental layers become closely apposed {{over most of}} their area forming the wing membrane. The {{remaining}} areas form channels, the future veins, in which the nerves and tracheae may occur. The cuticle surrounding the veins becomes thickened and more heavily sclerotized to provide strength and rigidity to the wing. Two types of hair may occur on the wings: microtrichia, which are small and irregularly scattered, and macrotrichia, which are larger, socketed, and may be restricted to veins. The scales of <b>Lepidoptera</b> and Trichoptera are highly modified macrotrichia.|$|E
5|$|Between 950,000–1,000,000 of all {{described}} {{species are}} insects, so over 50% of all described eukaryotes (1.8 million) are insects (see illustration). With only 950,000 known non-insects, if {{the actual number}} of insects is 5.5 million, they may represent over 80% of the total, and with only about 20,000 new species of all organisms being described each year, most insect species likely will remain undescribed, unless species descriptions greatly increase in rate. Of the 24 orders of insects, four dominate in terms of numbers of described species, with at least 670,000 species included in Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera and <b>Lepidoptera.</b>|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{adults are}} {{characterized}} by their four scale-covered wings, which give the <b>Lepidoptera</b> their name (Ancient Greek λεπίς lepís, scale + πτερόν pterón, wing). These scales give butterfly wings their colour: they are pigmented with melanins that give them blacks and browns, as well as uric acid derivatives and flavones that give them yellows, {{but many of the}} blues, greens, reds and iridescent colours are created by structural coloration produced by the micro-structures of the scales and hairs.|$|E
5|$|Cucurbita {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some <b>Lepidoptera</b> species, {{including}} the Cabbage Moth (Mamestra brassicae), Hypercompe indecisa, and the Turnip Moth (Agrotis segetum). Cucurbita can be susceptible to the pest Bemisia argentifolii (silverleaf whitefly) as well as aphids (Aphididae), cucumber beetles (Acalymma vittatum and Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi), squash bug (Anasa tristis), the squash vine borer (Melittia cucurbitae), and the twospotted spidermite (Tetranychus urticae). The squash bug causes major damage to plants because of its very toxic saliva.|$|E
5|$|Hippeastrum {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some <b>Lepidoptera</b> species {{including}} Spodoptera picta (Crinum grub) as well as Pseudococcidae (Mealybugs), large, and small narcissus bulb flies (Eumerus strigatus and E funeralis), thrips, mites, aphids, snails and slugs. A fungal disease attacking Hippeastrum is Stagonospora curtisii (red blotch, red leaf spot or red fire). The leaves are also eaten by grasshoppers, and grasshoppers commonly plant egg pods in the ground near Hippeastrum bulbs, which erupt in the spring, covering the plant with nymphs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lepidoptera</b> {{have two}} large, {{immovable}} compound eyes which {{consist of a}} large number of facets or lenses, each connected to a lens-like cylinder which is attached to a nerve leading to the brain. Each eye may have up to 17,000 individual light receptors (ommatidia) which in combination provide a broad mosaic view of the surrounding area. One tropical Asian family, the Amphitheridae, has compound eyes divided into two distinct segments. The eyes are usually smooth but may be covered by minute hairs. The eyes of butterflies are usually brown, golden-brown or even red as in the case of some species of skippers.|$|E
5|$|Lepidopterans {{are soft}} bodied, fragile and almost defenseless while the {{immature}} stages move slowly or are immobile, hence all stages {{are exposed to}} predation by birds, small mammals, lizards, amphibians, invertebrate predators (notably parasitoid and parasitic wasps and flies) as well as fungi and bacteria. To combat this, <b>Lepidoptera</b> have developed a number of strategies for defense and protection which include camouflage, aposematism, mimicry, {{and the development of}} threat patterns and displays.|$|E
