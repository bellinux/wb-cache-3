50|$|After {{graduation}} Overbeek joined Philips, where Evert Verwey, was {{his immediate}} boss. In addition {{to work on}} luminescent screens they worked together on the interaction between colloidal particles. Attraction, based on the summation of the London - van der Waals interactions between the atoms was established in 1937 by Hamaker who also worked at Philips. However, the details on the repulsion produced by the electric double layer around colloidal particles were not so clear. By using thermodynamic considerations, the relevant free energies were calculated and interaction potential were derived. This research resulted in a seminal work Theory of the Stability of <b>Lyophobic</b> Colloids. The work had a great influence, and is still used by considerations about the stability of colloids, but also in various other fields where charged surfaces interact with each other. The whole of that theory {{is now known as}} DLVO (Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, Overbeek) theory.|$|E
5000|$|A {{contact angle}} less than 90° (low contact angle) usually {{indicates}} that wetting {{of the surface}} is very favorable, and the fluid will spread over a large area of the surface. Contact angles greater than 90° (high contact angle) generally means that wetting of the surface is unfavorable, so the fluid will minimize contact with the surface and form a compact liquid droplet. For water, a wettable surface may also be termed hydrophilic and a nonwettable surface hydrophobic. Superhydrophobic surfaces have contact angles greater than 150°, showing almost no contact between the liquid drop and the surface. This is {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "Lotus effect".

50|$|In surface science, {{the term}} {{adhesion}} almost always refers to dispersive adhesion. In a typical solid-liquid-gas system (such as {{a drop of}} liquid on a solid surrounded by air) the contact angle is used to evaluate adhesiveness indirectly, while a Centrifugal Adhesion Balance allows for direct quantitative adhesion measurements. Generally, cases where the contact angle is low are considered of higher adhesion per unit area. This approach assumes that the lower contact angle corresponds to a higher surface energy. Theoretically, the more exact relation between contact angle and work of adhesion is more involved and is given by the Young-Dupre equation. The contact angle of the three-phase system is a function not only of dispersive adhesion (interaction between the molecules in the liquid and the molecules in the solid) but also cohesion (interaction between the liquid molecules themselves). Strong adhesion and weak cohesion results in {{a high degree of}} wetting, a lyophilic condition with low measured contact angles. Conversely, weak adhesion and strong cohesion results in <b>lyophobic</b> conditions with high measured contact angles and poor wetting.|$|E

From high speed video image analysis, the average large bubble diameter, the frequency of occurrence of large bubbles, the gas-liquid interfacial area, and the large bubble hold-up are obtained. The liquid side mass transfer coefficient is calculated from the volumetric mass transfer coefficient and the gas-liquid interfacial area. The lyophilic silica particles are rendered <b>lyophobic</b> by a methylation process to study {{the influence}} of particle wettability.

40|$|Polyhedral foams offer large gas-liquid {{interfacial}} area {{associated with a}} small amount of liquid. Therefore, if a solute adsorbs preferentially at the interface, the concentration of the solute in the foam will be greater than in the solution from which the foam has been generated. This effect provides a simple method of concentrating materials which have a tendency to adsorb on the gas-liquid interface. This is particularly relevant to biomaterials like whole cells, proteins, enzymes etc., which are surface active and are present in low concentrations in the broth. Foam separation has therefore attracted considerable attention, and several reports exist in literature on concentrating cells, proteins and enzymes using foams. Foam separation is based on the difference in surface activity of the components to be separated. A surface active molecule consists of a <b>lyophobic</b> and a lyophilic group. (As water is commonly used as a solvent, the lyophilic and <b>lyophobic</b> groups are called hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups, respectively).

To compute the droplet equilibrium shape, we minimize its interfacial free energy using both Surface Evolver and Monte Carlo calculations, finding good agreement between the two methods. We observe different droplet shapes, which are controlled by the droplet volume and the aspect ratio of the ellipse. In particular, we study the behavior of the nanodroplet contact angle along the three-phase contact line, explaining the different droplet shapes. Although the nanodroplet contact angle is constant and fixed by Young&# 039;s law inside and outside the elliptical patch, its value varies along the rim of the elliptical patch. We find that because of the pinning of the nanodroplet contact line at the rim of the elliptical patch, which has a nonconstant curvature, there is a regime of aspect ratios of the elliptical patch in which the nanodroplet starts expanding to the <b>lyophobic</b> part of the substrate, although there is still a finite area of the lyophilic patch free to be wetted...|$|E

40|$|Clusters {{of liquid}} drops growing {{and moving on}} {{physically}} or chemically textured <b>lyophobic</b> surfaces are encountered in drop-wise mode of vapor condensation. As opposed to film-wise condensation, drops permit a large heat transfer coefficient and are hence attractive. However, the temporal sustainability of drop formation on a surface is a challenging task, primarily because the sliding drops eventually leach away the lyophobicity promoter layer. Assuming {{that there is no}} chemical reaction between the promoter and the condensing liquid, the wall shear stress (viscous resistance) is the prime parameter for controlling physical leaching. The dynamic shape of individual droplets, as they form and roll/slide on such surfaces, determines the effective shear interaction at the wall. Given a shear stress distribution of an individual droplet, the net effect of droplet ensemble can be determined using the time averaged population density during condensation. In this paper, we solve the Navier-Stokes and the energy equation in three-dimensions on an unstructured tetrahedral grid representing the computational domain corresponding to an isolated pendant droplet sliding on a <b>lyophobic</b> substrate. We correlate the droplet Reynolds number (Re = 10 - 500, based on droplet hydraulic diameter), contact angle and shape of droplet with wall shear stress and heat transfer coefficient. The simulations presented here are for Prandtl Number (Pr) = 5. 8. We see that, both Poiseuille number (Po) and Nusselt number (Nu), increase with increasing the droplet Reynolds number.

To clarify this issue, in the present work we have performed a set of vapor preassure osmometry experiments investigating the asphaltene agglomeration inhibition by commercial and new inhibitor molecules in toluene and o-diclorobenzene. Monte Carlo computer modeling has been applied to interpret some unexpected trends of molar mass of the Puerto Ceiba asphaltene clusters at different concentrations of inhibitor, assuming that inhibitors efficiency is directly related to their adsorption on the surface of asphaltene or its complexes.
