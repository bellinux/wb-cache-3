40|$|One of {{the main}} {{requirements}} of threaded & coupled connections used in oil-producing wells {{is the ability to}} resist high tensile loads. In order to ensure integrity under ever-increasing loads, the geometric parameters of the connection can be modified. In this paper, an FEA study of a 4. 5 inch casing connection is reported {{to examine the effects of}} a modified load angle in combination with high tensile forces. The focus is on two failure mechanisms: jump-out and plastically deformed zones. Furthermore, a relative motion of pin and box at the contact regions is observed. It is concluded that using a negative <b>load</b> <b>flank</b> might be beneficial in order to prevent jump-out. At the same time, the deformations at the roots of the last engaged threads of the pin appear to be larger and relative sliding increases. Despite an optimization against one failure mechanism, the connection might fail as a result of an inevitable reduction of resistance against another...|$|E
40|$|Loading {{and contact}} stress {{distribution}} on the thread teeth in tubing and casing premium threaded connections are {{of great importance}} for design optimization, pretightening force control, and thread failure prevention. This paper proposes an analytical method based on the elastic mechanics. This {{is quite different from}} other papers, which mainly rely on finite element analysis. The differential equation of load distribution on the thread teeth was established according to equal pitch of the engaged thread after deformation and solved by finite difference method. Furthermore, the relation between load acting on each engaged thread and mean contact stress on its <b>load</b> <b>flank</b> is set up based on the geometric description of thread surface. By comparison, this new analytical method with the finite element analysis for a modified API 177. 8 [*]mm premium threaded connection is approved. Comparison of the contact stress on the last engaged thread between analytical model and FEM shows that the accuracy of analytical model will decline with the increase of pretightening force after the material enters into plastic deformation. However, the analytical method can meet the needs of engineering to some extent because its relative error is about 6. 2 %~ 18. 1 % for the in-service level of pretightening force...|$|E
40|$|A {{parametric}} {{program designed}} for modeling tapered, trapezoidal threaded connections {{is used in}} combination with Abaqus to investigate the behavior of couplings subjected to static load combinations containing make-up, axial tension and internal pressure. Three criteria are defined and used to quantify {{the performance of the}} connection: load distribution, helical gap size between the threads and the amount of global plasticity. From these parameters, the load distribution provides valuable information about the effectiveness of the load bearing characteristics of the thread and can be used to detect possible overstressing of the connection. The helical gap size is used to estimate its tendency to provide a leak tight thread seal, while the global plasticity reflects the total amount of plastic deformation within the connection. During the investigation, the effects of taper angle, <b>load</b> <b>flank</b> angle, wall thickness, size of threads and initial thread clearance are considered. The presented modeling approach consists of three parts. First, the optimal make-up position for a trapezoidal threaded 4. 5 inch TN 80 connection is calculated using the plasticity criterion. Next, the results for the three performance parameters as a function of both axial tension and internal pressure are discussed. Finally, after investigating the various isolated effects induced by geometric changes, a newly defined, enhanced threaded geometry is suggested and compared with the standardized API-buttress thread...|$|E
40|$|The RH and LH pinions of {{main gearbox}} {{pertaining}} to a helicopter {{were sent to}} the laboratory for investigation. Examination showed spalling on the <b>loading</b> <b>flank</b> of two teeth of the LH pinion. Detailed study carried out on the samples from the damaged teeth discovered that the spalling initiated {{at the bottom of the}} dedendum, and that the subsurface cracks propagated progressively upward. Initiation of spalling was observed all along the bottom of the dedendum in all the teeth. This was found to be due to excessive contact stresses resulting from tip biting. In general, the evidences on the flank surface suggested considerable sliding of the pinion instead of rolling. The meshing of the pinion did not appear to be healthy. It encompassed the entire tooth height right up to the top land. It may, however, be noted that no gear/pinion is designed to have such contact patterns. Hence, it is imperative that the elastic deformation of the tooth under full load was more than that of the anticipated design value. Also, when the <b>load</b> on the <b>flank</b> is excessively high, it would promote sliding rather than rolling, as seen in the present case. The RH pinion did not have any observable damage though it also showed meshing and contact patterns similar to that seen in case of LH pinion. However, metallographic study conducted on the cross section of the teeth indicated initiation of subsurface cracks on the <b>loading</b> <b>flank</b> of this pinion as well. The microstructure, composition and the surface hardness of the teeth were found to be satisfactory. The case depth on the <b>loading</b> <b>flank</b> was found to be in the range 0. 78 to 0. 89 mm for LH pinion and 0. 78 to 0. 87 mm for RH pinion. In summary, it is stated that the LH pinion has failed by spalling. Study also showed evidences of initiation of spalling in the RH pinion. Investigation revealed that all factors required for spalling were present, namely, unfavourable meshing, high load, and tip biting. From the analysis, it appears that deficiencies other than metallurgical factors were responsible for the premature spalling in the pinions...|$|R
40|$|A damaged input pinion, part No. 201 P 636 H 1302 201 bearing Sl. No. HDSN 527, {{belonging}} to Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) was forwarded to this laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed {{loss of material}} by spalling on the <b>loading</b> <b>flank</b> of two teeth of the pinion. Spalling was resulted due to surface contact fatigue. It was discovered that there were rough machining marks on the flank of the teeth. The stress concentrators at these machining marks {{were responsible for the}} premature surface contact fatigue crack initiation in the teeth. Subsequently, the surface contact fatigue has manifested in the form of spalling leading to loss of material from the <b>loading</b> <b>flank</b> surface. Evidences also suggest that probably, the working load on the pinion was in the higher side. It is believed that this in conjunction with the stress concentrators in the form of machining marks has accelerated the surface contact fatigue crack initiation. Laboratory test results show that the material of construction of the pinion conforms to the design specification in terms of chemical composition, microstructure, surface hardness, case depth, and core hardness. No metallurgical abnormalities were found responsible for the failure of the pinion. A detailed analysis of the failure is presented in this report...|$|R
40|$|Dissertation {{thesis is}} focused on development, design and {{production}} of the new milling cutter which is used for roughing operations. High-speed steels, coating technology and milling technology are described in first chapters of dissertation thesis. The main part of this thesis is {{the design of the}} new milling cutter that has been designed {{on the basis of the}} machining simulation. The milling cutter is designed as a three-flute cylindrical end mill made of high speed steel. The each flute is composed of two special compensation edges. The compensation edges are used for reducing (at best suppression) tensile stress in the heel of the tooth. The milling cutter was made by lost wax technology, followed by grinding and thermal treatment. New designed tools were deposited by PVD coatings (e. g. (Al,Ti) N). Standard catalog milling cutters (producer ZPS - milling tools, Zlín, Czech Republic) were used for comparison the designed milling cutter. Carbon steel CSN 41 2050 (DIN 1. 1191) was used for milling, which was carried out with using process liquid. The monitored parameters were force <b>loading,</b> <b>flank</b> wear and tensile stress during milling. The dynamometer Kistler was used for measuring force loading and data obtained during machining was used for stress analysis...|$|R
40|$|Stress Engineering Services (SES) was {{contracted}} by Mr. John Watts to {{test his}} threaded connection developed for oilfield oil and gas service. This particular test required {{the application of a}} variety of loads including axial tension and compression, internal pressure (gas), external pressure (water), bending and both low and elevated temperature. These loads were used to determine the sealing and structural limits of the connection. The connection design tested had tapered threads with 10 threads per inch. A square thread form and a round thread form were tested. The square thread form had a 2 {sup o} <b>load</b> <b>flank</b> and 15 {sup o} stab flank. The round thread had a 0 {sup o} <b>load</b> <b>flank</b> and 20 {sup o} stab flank. Most of the testing was performed on the round thread form. Both a coupled connection design and an integral connection design were tested. The coupling was a pin by pin (male) thread, with the pipe having a box (female) thread. Both designs have outside and inside diameters that are flush with the pipe body. Both designs also contain a small external shoulder. The test procedure selected for this evaluation was the newly written ISO 13679 procedure for full scale testing of casing and tubing connections. The ISO procedure requires a variety of tests that includes makeup/breakout testing, internal gas sealability/external water sealability testing with axial tension, axial compression, bending, internal gas thermal cycle tests and limit load (failure) tests. This test was performed with four coupled samples and included most of these loads. Two integral samples were also included for limit load testing ISO makeup/breakout tests are divided into three types [...] initial makeup, IML 1, repeated makeup within the same sample, MBL, and repeated makeup using several samples called round robin, RR. IMU and MBL were performed in this project. The ISO sealing and structural procedure is divided into four primary tests and identified as Series A, B, C and Limit Load (failure). Series A and B test to 95 % actual yield of the pipe and Series C uses 90 % of actual yield. Samples 1 and 3 were tested to Series A and the loads are shown in Figure 1. For these samples, the axial compression was limited to 75 % pipe body yield, which was set by Mr. Watts {{at the beginning of the}} test. Samples 2 and 4 were tested to Series B with loads shown in Figure 2. This series included 20 degrees per 100 feet bending but no external pressure. Due to premature leaks, no samples were subjected to Series C which included mechanical and thermal cycles. Samples 5 and 6 were tested to failure. The project started with the selection and purchase of a popular size of oilfield pipe, which was 7 -inch OD, 32 pound per foot, P- 110 casing. While the connections were being threaded, material tensile tests were performed to get the actual strength of the 7 -inch pipe. The first samples contained a square thread form. Excessive galling was experienced during the first series of makeup/breakout tests and Mr. Watts decided to change the thread form and remachine the samples. The second samples had a round thread form and performed very well in the makeup/breakout tests. Basically no galling occurred of any consequence. Samples 1 and 3 were to be tested with external water (ISO Series A) while samples 2 and 4 were to be tested with bending (ISO Series B, no external pressure). Testing of all four samples started with tension and internal gas pressure. During this initial pressure testing, samples 1, 3 and 4 developed leaks and the test was stopped before any external pressure or bending was applied. Sample 2 successfully tested to ISO Load Point 5 which included bending before developing a leak. Figure 3 shows the loads at which the samples leaked and the relative pipe body performance capability. Sample 1 and end A of sample 2 held a high pressure while samples 3, 4 and end B of sample 2 leaked at relatively low pressures. All of these leaks were with nitrogen gas pressure. After reviewing the results, it was believed that several conditions may have contributed to the premature leaks: The BOL 2000 thread lubricant contains solid particles that are larger than the solid particles in API 5 A 2 compound. Possibly the large particles prevented tight thread contact necessary for gas leak tightness. The BOL 2000 lubricant may have caused or at least contributed to the yielding of the pin end during makeup. Pin inward deformation was found in some pins subsequent to testing and breakout. Excessive yielding of the pin or box will contribute to poor thread contact and leakage. The connections were made up to full or near full shoulder contact. This causes the end of the pin to be stressed near the yield strength. This along with the interference caused by the thread compound may cause excessive pin hoop stresses and yielding which in turn gives relatively loose thread contact. This behavior is present when repeated makeup and breakout occurs...|$|E
40|$|A few {{components}} {{belonging to}} the engine accessory gearbox of an aeroengine were forwarded to this laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed that there was fatigue failure in the bevel gear on O 11 axis bearing part No. 104. 06. 52. 008 and Sl. No. /set No. II 054027. Multiple fatigue cracks {{were found to have}} initiated at the concave side root fillet of one of the teeth. After initiation, these cracks have propagated progressively over a distance of about 45 mm in the hub before giving way to overload failure. The failure has resulted in dislodgement of a sector of the gear encompassing 5 teeth. Detailed examination revealed that the fatigue cracks were initiated during the start-up of the engine, that is, when the concave side of the teeth was the <b>loading</b> <b>flank.</b> It was also discovered that after initiation, these cracks have propagated only when the concave side of the teeth acted as the <b>loading</b> <b>flank,</b> that is, during the start-up of the engine. Similar fatigue cracks were seen in another tooth of the fractured segment. The fracture surface of the gear had distinctive bands that were resulted due to change in the crack propagation plane. The change in crack propagation plane generally occurs due to sudden change in the state of stress ahead of the crack tip such as during starting of the engine.

Assuming that each band is associated with a starting cycle of the engine and the A few components {{belonging to the}} engine accessory gearbox of an aeroengine were forwarded to this laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed that there was fatigue failure in the bevel gear on O 11 axis bearing part No. 104. 06. 52. 008 and Sl. No. /set No.  054027. Multiple fatigue cracks were found to have initiated at the concave side root fillet of one of the teeth.

The change in crack propagation plane generally occurs due to sudden change in the state of stress ahead of the crack tip such as during starting of the engine. Examination revealed that there were about 175 bands on the fracture surface. Assuming that each band is associated with a starting cycle of the engine and the average duration of each starting cycle as 50 s, the crack propagation time, after initiation, is estimated to be approximately 2. 5 hr. Also, since the engine had a total of 288 starting cycles, it is, therefore, stated that the fatigue cracks were initiated in the gear after about 115 starting cycles after the engine was inducted in service. The primary failure in the engine accessory gearbox (EAGB) has been identified as the fatigue failure of the bevel gear on O 11 axis. Once the fracturing took place in this gear, the smooth running of the bevel gear pair in O 11 and O 1 axes was affected. This has led to resistance in power transmission from engine to the EAGB. During this time, the quill shaft on O 11 axis (part No. 104. 06. 52. 003) has failed by torsional overload. Hence, the failure in the quill shaft is secondary in nature and it occurred subsequent to the primary fatigue failure of the bevel gear on O 11 axis. The other damages seen on bevel gear on O 1 axis (part No. 104. 06. 52. 200) and the spur gear (part No. 104. 06. 52. 025) are also secondary in nature. Fatigue crack initiation regions in bevel gear on O 11 axis were largely damaged due to post fracture impact. However, the available fracture signatures and the location of fatigue crack origins did not suggest any specific abnormalities in the material which could be responsible for premature fatigue crack initiation. This was further confirmed through metallurgical examination of the gear wherein the material of construction was found to conform to specification with respect to composition, microstructure, surface hardening, hardness and case depth. Hence, the fatigue failure of the gear appears to be because of reasons other than metallurgical factors. From the laboratory examination and the analysis, {{it was not possible to}} identify the exact cause(s) for the premature fatigue crack initiation in the bevel gear in question. However, based on the failure evidences and the analysis, one or more of the following could be responsible for the fatigue crack initiation. It is suggested that these aspects be examined thoroughly by the investigation committee/court of inquiry before the conclusions are drawn. (a) 	The fatigue crack has initiated and propagated only when the bevel gear on O 11 axis has acted as a driven gear, that is, during the engine start-up. Hence, it needs to be examined whether or not there was any situation during the service life of the engine wherein the torque during starting cycle exceeded the design value. Examination of the run-down time in the engine log may provide valuable information in this regard. It is important to note that once the cracks initiate, they continue to propagate even if the engine running conditions are normal thereafter. (b) 	The meshing between the bevel gears of O 11 and O 1 axes needs to be examined. In this regard, the contact patterns on the flanks of the failed gear need to be analyzed. In case of abnormal meshing, tooth bending stresses at the fillet may be unfavourable and this can promote premature fatigue crack initiation in the gear. (c) 	Examination revealed discrete tool marks on the root region of the failed bevel gear. Comparative study suggested that such tool marks were not present in the root region of the bevel gear of O 1 axis. Possible stress concentration effect because of the presence of rough machining marks leading to premature fatigue crack initiation also needs to be examined...|$|R
40|$|AbstractResidual {{stress is}} one of the most {{critical}} parameters in surface integrity, which has a great impact on fatigue life of the machined components. While the flank milling of titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V has been widely applied to the manufacture of jet engine for its high productivity in aerospace industry, prediction of residual stress induced by this process is seldom reported. In this paper, an analytical model of residual stress is proposed, based on comprehensive analysis of the mechanical <b>loading</b> during <b>flank</b> milling. For the first time, the sequential discontinuous variable <b>loading</b> feature of <b>flank</b> milling is taken into consideration. An incremental elasto-plastic method followed by a relaxation procedure is used to get the stress-strain history of an arbitrary point in the subsurface so as to predict the residual stress retained in the workpiece after several loading cycles. We find that during the last phase in which the machined surface is generated, the main load comes from the plough effect of cutting edge as the uncut depth approaches zero. The simulation results indicate that the flank milled surface shows more compressive residual stress in the axial direction than in the feed direction. To validate the prediction, a series of cutting tests are conducted on Ti- 6 Al- 4 V using finish parameters and X-ray diffraction is utilized to obtain the residual stress...|$|R

40|$|The {{amount of}} torque {{required}} to either further tighten or loosen the connection under tension and pressure was determined from the threaded {{model and the}} same method of summing thread forces x radii. Using 0. 021 friction coef-ficient, the torques were: Nominal tapers at three turns, torque = 5 5 3 8 ft • lb Addition of 500 kips tension = 5628 ft*lb Addition of 11, 220 psi pressure = 10, 480 ft-lb Therefore, tension has negligible effect and pressure has a significant effect. The lack of effect by tension is due to loss of preload force on the stab flanks being equal to the increase of force on the <b>load</b> <b>flanks,</b> thereby producing no change on total torque. This behavior was also recognized by Clinedinst. Effect of Yielding on Torque Part II of this paper discusses elastic and plastic solutions with the threaded finite element model that used to determine maximum strain for 5. 4 turns, 9350 psi and 660 kips tension. The assembly interference was for a fast pin and slow box, with interferences of 0. 0079 in. at the pin end and 0. 0231 in. at the box end. Stresses were compared in Fig. 12 of Part II and showed significant reductions due to yielding of the P-l 10 material with the stress/strain relationship shown in Fig. 11 of Part II. The same solutions were {{used to compare the}} effects of load and yielding on torque with results given in Table 7. Torque reduction due to yielding when assembled was 11 percent and the reduction at full load was 16 percent. The reductions are not particularly high but do show a source of variation in the torque/turn relationship that can occur for makeup.

40|$|The neural {{correlates}} of perceptual load induced attentional selection were investigated in an functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) experiment in which attentional selection was manipulated through the variation of perceptual load in target search. Participants searched for a vertically or horizontally oriented bar among heterogeneously (the high load condition) or homogeneously (the low load condition) oriented distractor bars in the central display, which was flanked by a vertical or horizontal bar presented at the left or the right periphery. The search reaction times were longer when the central display was of high load than of low load, and were longer when the flanker was incongruent than congruent with the target. Importantly, the flanker congruency effect was manifested only in the low load condition, not in the high load condition, indicating that the perceptual load in target search determined whether the task-irrelevant flanker was processed. Imaging analyses revealed a set of fronto-parietal regions having higher activations in the high than in the low load condition. Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was more activated for the incongruent than for the congruent trials. Moreover, ACC and bilateral anterior insula were sensitive to the interaction between perceptual <b>load</b> and <b>flanker</b> congruency such that the activation differences between the incongruent and congruent conditions were significant in the low, but not in the high load condition. These results are consistent with the claim that ACC and bilateral anterior insula may exert executive control by selectively biasing processing in favor of task-relevant information and this biasing depends on the resources currently available to the control system...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Depression in {{the context}} of bipolar {{disorder}} (BDd) is often misdiagnosed as unipolar disorder depression (UDd) leading to poor clinical outcomes for many bipolar sufferers. We examined neural circuitry supporting emotion regulation in females with either BDd or UDd as a first stage toward identifying biomarkers that may differentiate BDd from UDd. METHOD: Fifty-seven females aged 18 - 45 years participated in this study: 23 with UDd, 18 with bipolar disorder type I depression (BDId) and 16 healthy females. During 3 -T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the participants performed an emotional face n-back (EFNBACK) task, that is an n-back task with high (2 -back) and low (0 -back) memory <b>load</b> conditions <b>flanked</b> by two positive, negative or neutral face distracters. This paradigm examines executive control with emotional distracters-emotion regulation. RESULTS: High memory load with neutral face distracters elicited greater bilateral and left dorsal anterior midcingulate cortex (dAMCC) activity in UDd than in healthy and BDId females respectively, and greater bilateral putamen activity in both depressed groups versus healthy females. High memory load with happy face distracters elicited greater left putamen activity in UDd than in healthy females. Psychotropic medication was associated with greater putamen activity to these contrasts in UDd females. CONCLUSIONS: During high memory load with neutral face distracters, elevated dAMCC activity in UDd suggests abnormal recruitment of attentional control circuitry to maintain task performance, whereas elevated putamen activity unrelated to psychotropic medication in BDId females may suggest an attentional bias toward ambiguous neutral face distracters. Differential patterns of functional abnormalities in neural circuitry supporting attentional control during emotion regulation, especially in the dAMCC, is a promising neuroimaging measure to distinguish UDd from BDId in females...|$|R

The principal requirements towards all modern gearboxes are {{to comply with the}} steadily-increasing power density and to simultaneously offer a high reliability of their components. With increasing gear size, the load stresses at greater material depth increase. Thus, the material and particularly the strength properties also at greater material depth gain more importance. The present paper initially gives an overview of the main failure modes of case carburized gears resulting from material fatigue. Furthermore, the underlying load and stress mechanisms, under particular contemplation of the gear size, will be discussed, as these considerations principally define the required material properties. Subsequently, the principles of newly developed, as well as modified alloy concepts for optimized gear steels with high load carrying capacity are presented. In the experimental work, the load carrying capacity of the tooth root and tooth flank was determined using a pulsator, as well as an FZG back-to-back test rig.

40|$|Ischia is the {{emergent}} {{top of a}} large volcanic complex that rises more than 1, 000 m above the sea floor, at the north-western end of the Gulf of Naples. Caldera resurgence in {{the central part of}} the island has resulted in the formation of differentially displaced blocks, among which Mt. Epomeo (787 m a. s. l.) is the most uplifted. Deformation and slope instability have been recognised as common features induced by a block resurgence mechanism that causes uplift and favours gravitational <b>loading</b> and <b>flank</b> failure. The Monte Nuovo block, a topographic high on the north-western flank of Mt. Epomeo, has recently been interpreted as a block affected by deep-seated gravitational slope deformation. This block may undergo a catastrophic failure in the case of renewal of magmatic activity. This paper investigates the potential failure of the Monte Nuovo block as a rockslide-debris avalanche, the consequent tsunami generation and wave propagation, and discusses the catastrophic effects of such an event. Mobilization-prone volume has been estimated at about 160. 10 (6) m(3) and would move from a maximum elevation of 400 m a. s. l. The landslide itself would sweep away a densely populated territory as large as 3. 5 km(2). The highest waves generated by the tsunami, on which this paper is mainly focussed, would hit the northern and western shores of Ischia. However, the high coast would prevent inundation and limit devastation to beaches, harbours and surrounding areas. Most of the tsunami energy would head towards the north-east, hitting the Campania coast. Severe inundation would affect an area of up to 20 km(2) around the mouth of the Volturno river, including the urban area of Castel Volturno. In contrast, less energy would travel towards the south, and the Gulf of Naples would be perturbed by long persisting waves of limited damaging potential...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{volcanism}} in El Hierro Island {{is mostly}} concentrated along three elongated and narrow zones which converge {{at the center}} of the island. These zones with extensive volcanism have been identified as rift zones. The presence of similar structures is common in many volcanic oceanic islands, so understanding their origin, dynamics and structure is important to conduct hazard assessment in such environments. There is still not consensus on the origin of the El Hierro rift zones, having been associated with mantle uplift or interpreted as resulting from gravitational spreading and flank instability. To further understand the internal structure and origin of the El Hierro rift systems, starting from the previous gravity studies, we developed a new 3 D gravity inversion model for its shallower layers, gathering a detailed picture of this part of the island, which has permitted a new interpretation about these rifts. Previous models already identified a main central magma accumulation zone and several shallower high density bodies. The new model allows a better resolution of the pathways that connect both levels and the surface. Our results do not point to any correspondence between the upper parts of these pathways and the rift identified at the surface. Non-clear evidence of progression toward deeper parts into the volcanic system is shown, so we interpret them as very shallow structures, probably originated by local extensional stresses derived from gravitational <b>loading</b> and <b>flank</b> instability, which are used to facilitate the lateral transport of magma when it arrives close to the surface. © 2017 Elsevier B.

40|$|When {{establishing}} oil wells, pipe sections {{are connected}} {{by means of}} threaded couplings. In an effort to minimize the possibility of failure by jumpout, standard buttress connections were introduced. Part of their strength is directly acquired {{as a result of}} radial interference during make-up. This paper discusses the results of a numerical study evaluating the effect of make-up on the performance of a standard 4. 5 inch API buttress connection when axial tensile force is applied. In order to characterize the structural performance, the load distribution along the coupling length is evaluated, combined with a parameter defining thread separation. The latter is indicative for jumpout and the tendency of creating a leak path throughout the thread helix. From the results it is clear that relative axial displacement within the coupling occurs, even when made up, because of an initial clearance among the <b>load</b> and stab <b>flanks.</b> This clearance may cause a connection to leak through the thread helix when available thread compound cannot heal this leak path. Despite undesirable effects on the sealability and rigidness of this joint, such a clearance is required to decrease frictional forces during make-up while maintaining the desired radial interference...|$|R

Through the investigation of three advanced surface coatings the developed model is shown to offer detailed subsurface stress and strain information, quantifying the benefits provided by the application of each coating. A number of rolling contact fatigue tests was also conducted to complement the computational simulations. An adapted twin disc testing machine was used to investigate the progressive wear rates of the three advanced surface coatings when subjected to mixed rolling-sliding contact at high load and in dry conditions. The result is a clear indication that advanced surface coating techniques can provide significant improvements in wear resistance and surface durability. From the rolling contact fatigue experiments conducted in this study, a multilayer Tungsten Carbide/Carbon coating was shown to provide the most significant increase in surface durability with a 16 -fold reduction in measured weight loss compared to the uncoated substrate over the 145, 000 cycle test duration investigated...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, contact {{conditions}} {{between a}} tool and a workpiece material for wear-simulating turning by a cutter with a sharp-cornered edge {{and with a}} rounded cutting edge are analysed. The results of the experimental study of specific contact load distribution over the artificial flank wear-land of the cutter in free orthogonal turning of the disk from titanium alloy (Ti[6]Al[2]Mo[2]Cr), ductile (63 Cu) and brittle (57 Cu 1 Al[3]Mn) brasses are described. Investigations were {{carried out by the}} method of 'split cutter' and by the method of the artificial flank-land of variable width. The experiments with a variable feed rate and a cutting speed show that in titanium alloy machining with a sharp-cornered cutting edge the highest normal contact load ([sigma][h max]= 3400 [...] . 2200 MPa) is observed immediately at the cutting edge, and the curve has a horizontal region with the length of 0. 2 [...] . 0. 6 mm. At a distance from the cutting edge, the value of specific normal contact load is dramatically reduced to 1100 [...] . 500 MPa. The character of normal contact load for a rounded cutting edge is different -it is uniform, and its value is approximately 2 times smaller compared to machining with a sharp-cornered cutting edge. In author's opinion it is connected with generation of a seizure zone in a chip formation region and explains the capacity of highly worn-out cutting tools for titanium alloys machining. The paper analyses the distribution of tangential contact <b>loads</b> over the <b>flank</b> land, which pattern differs considerably for machining with a sharp-cornered edge and with a rounded cutting edg...|$|R
40|$|Within {{synthetic}} biology, {{significant progress}} in creating networks using transcriptional and translational control has been made, but a network comprised solely of protein-protein interactions {{has not yet been}} built. To realize this goal, new design rules for assembling and connecting protein devices into circuits are required. In this thesis, a framework for rapid assembly and delivery of genetic networks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is described. Utilizing this scheme, design principles of modular chimeric proteins, engineered pathway convergence, and phosphorylated activated localization are developed and subsequently applied to create phosphoin/phospho-out composable protein devices in yeast. The devices implement BUFFER, NOT and OR logical operations and collectively form a functionally complete set whereas multiple instances of the devices can be connected to implement any logical expression. Furthermore, bridge devices to interface small molecule sensors and transcriptional networks with protein devices are created. To illustrate composability, two systems are engineered in yeast, the first of which interfaces a phosphorylation <b>load</b> driver within <b>flanking</b> transcriptional regulatory modules to mitigate retroactivity, exemplifying time-scale separation as a means of realizing functional modularity in biological networks. The second system, a fast bistable toggle switch, is the first synthetic network based solely on protein interactions and can be interfaced endogenously to allow controllable abrogation of yeast budding. Work in this thesis provides a set of useful design principles for engineering protein networks in eukaryotes and may improve understanding of natural signaling motifs, allow modulation of existing networks, or foster new synthetic biology applications. by Deepak Mishra.
