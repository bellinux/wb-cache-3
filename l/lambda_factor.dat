40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} experiments give {{insight into}} the evolving energy partitioning during high-strain torsion experiments of calcite. Our numerical experiments are designed to derive a generic macroscopic grain size sensitive flow law capable of describing the full evolution from the transient regime to steady state. The transient regime is crucial for {{understanding the importance of}} micro structural processes that may lead to strain localization phenomena in deforming materials. This is particularly important in geological and geodynamic applications where the phenomenon of strain localization happens outside the time frame that can be observed under controlled laboratory conditions. Ourmethod is based on an extension of the paleowattmeter approach to the transient regime. We add an empirical hardening law using the Ramberg-Osgood approximation and assess the experiments by an evolution test function of stored over dissipated energy (<b>lambda</b> <b>factor).</b> Parameter studies of, strain hardening, dislocation creep parameter, strain rates, temperature, and <b>lambda</b> <b>factor</b> as well asmesh sensitivity are presented to explore the sensitivity of the newly derived transient/steady state flow law. Our analysis can be seen {{as one of the first}} steps in a hybrid computational-laboratory-field modeling workflow. The analysis could be improved through independent verifications by thermographic analysis in physical laboratory experiments to independently assess <b>lambda</b> <b>factor</b> evolution under laboratory conditions...|$|E

The engine under study is a Hino K- 13 CTI 13, 000 cc 24 valve turbocharged engine coupled to a 3 phase 4 pole induction motor to produce electricity at 50 Hz. Modifications include an addition of biogas carburetor for air-fuel mixing, replacing the fuel injection system with spark ignition system, reduction of compression ratio from the original 16 : 1 to 8 : 1 using a cylinder head spacer, and modification of the turbocharger waste gate so the boost pressure can be adjusted.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{additions}} and deletions of the S&P 500. Competing event studies will be performed to analyze the announcement effect with different benchmarks. The main components of the paper are a Market Model based event study and a GARCH(1, 1) -M Model study. The GARCH-M Model assumes a relation between variance and mean of an asset, where the variance tends to follow a long-run variance, and is dependent upon the stock's preceding abnormal return and variance. The event study examines approximately 350 stocks over 240 trading days. I have to confirm a positive index effect for additions and vice versa for deletions. Price, abnormal return, volume and variance of added stocks rise on the day after the announcement. My analysis reveal a semi-strong reversal and therefore are consistent with the Price Pressure Hypothesis and partly with the Imperfect Substitutes and the Visibility Hypothesis. The hypothesis of a significant <b>lambda</b> <b>factor</b> - the impact of the variance on the mean - has to be rejected for the additions and deletions of the S&P 500 for all event studies conducted.

The work here describes the generation of resonance parameters for the MOC DeCART which utilizes the subgroup method for its resonance treatment. In this paper, we first introduce a procedure for determining the intermediate resonance parameters for all scattering isotopes, also know as lambda parameters or Goldstein-Cohen parameters which are used in the subgroup method. The <b>lambda</b> <b>factors</b> of scattering isotopes are determined as hydrogen equivalence factors by comparing group average cross sections in the mixture of resonance isotope and hydrogen with the average cross sections in mixtures with the hydrogen which is partly replaced by other isotopes. The NJOY code is used for the calculation of spectra in these mixtures.

The objective of this work {{was to develop a}} broad-group library suitable for production analyses with SCALE for HTGR applications. Several interim libraries were generated from SCALE fine-group 238 - and 999 -group libraries, and the final broad-group library was created from Evaluated Nuclear Data File/B Version ENDF/B-VII Release 0 cross-section evaluations using new ORNL methodologies with AMPX, SCALE, and other codes. Furthermore, intermediate resonance (IR) methods were applied to the HTGR broadgroup library, and <b>lambda</b> <b>factors</b> and f-factors were incorporated into the library s nuclear data files. A new version of the SCALE BONAMI module named BONAMI-IR was developed to process the IR data in the new library and, thus, eliminate the need for the CENTRM/PMC modules for resonance selfshielding. This report documents the development of the HTGR broad-group nuclear data library and the results of test and benchmark calculations using the new library with SCALE. The 81 -group library is shown to model HTGR cases with similar accuracy to the SCALE 238 -group library but with significantly faster computational times due to the reduced number of energy groups and the use of BONAMI-IR instead of BONAMI/CENTRM/PMC for resonance self-shielding calculations...|$|R
3000|$|To {{achieve a}} target bitrate in real {{constraint}} situations, such as {{within a specific}} channel bandwidth or within defined encoder and decoder buffer sizes, QP values must vary dynamically based on {{the complexity of the}} input video and the current bitrate. QP values are determined using a rate-quantization (R-Q) model where the generated bitrate is modeled {{as a function of the}} QP and the complexity of the residual signal such as the mean absolute difference (MAD). In H. 264 /AVC, QPs are used not only in rate control, but also in rate distortion optimization (RDO). However, the famous [...] "chicken-egg" [...] dilemma complicates the selection of the QP value. The function for the RDO needs a pre-determined QP for its <b>lambda</b> <b>factor.</b> However, the QP can be determined by the MAD, which is only available after the RDO is obtained. To resolve that dilemma, the MAD is predicted from the previous frame using a linear function [1]. The estimated MAD from the previous frame is often different from the actual MAD in the current frame. Thus, an inadequate QP may be selected. For improved coding efficiency, enhanced distortion models [2 – 6] are developed and rate-distortion (R-D) model is optimized or contents-aware bit allocation is proposed [5 – 10]. A number of recent approaches incorporate characteristics of the human visual system (HVS) into bitrate control. Moreover, there are several reports on region-of-interest (ROI)-based bit allocation [11 – 13]; such approaches can potentially improve the perceived visual quality of images. In addition to ROI-based methods, a new R-D model, along with frame skipping and bit-allocation schemes, using various perceptual metrics that are based on the characteristics of HVS, is proposed [14 – 19]. However, the conventional bitrate control algorithms based on QP control often suffer from perceptible image quality degradations, such as blocking, ringing, or texture-deviation artifacts, when the target bitrate is very low. Furthermore, when the target bitrate is not satisfied, even with the maximum QP value, the conventional rate control cannot avoid a sudden frame drop which results in video quality degradation.|$|E

More precisely, the weight in the i-th position of the run is divided by lambda^i, where the discount <b>factor</b> <b>lambda</b> is a fixed rational number greater than 1. Discounted summation is a common and useful measuring scheme, especially for infinite sequences, which reflects the assumption that earlier weights {{are more important than}} later weights. Determinizing automata is often essential, for example, in formal verification, where there are polynomial algorithms for comparing two deterministic NDAs, while the equivalence problem for NDAs is not known to be decidable. Unfortunately, however, discounted-sum automata are, in general, not determinizable: it is currently known that for every rational discount <b>factor</b> 1 < <b>lambda</b> < 2, there is an NDA with lambda (denoted lambda-NDA) that cannot be determinized. We provide positive news, showing that every NDA with an integral factor is determinizable. We also complete the picture by proving that the integers characterize exactly the discount factors that guarantee determinizability: we show that for every non-integral rational <b>factor</b> <b>lambda,</b> there is a nondeterminizable lambda-NDA. Finally, we prove that the class of NDAs with integral discount factors enjoys closure under the algebraic operations min, max, addition, and subtraction, which is not the case for general NDAs nor for deterministic NDAs. This shows that for integral discount factors, the class of NDAs forms an attractive specification formalism in quantitative formal verification.

These analyses enable biologists to predict future population size and structure, assess extinction risk, {{and identify the}} stages and transitions in a species' life history that have the largest effects on population growth rate (lambda). It is also possible, using these analyses, to weigh the relative effectiveness of different management strategies. In this study, I constructed a matrix population model for a threatened Hawaiian plant species, the Haleakala silversword (Argyroxiphium sandwicense ssp. macrocephalum), {{in order to assess}} the viability of this population under different disturbance and management regimes. Over five years, I assessed annual variation in seed set and quantified reproductive vital rates for use in a matrix model. These data were combined with long-term demographic data in order to construct a stage-based matrix model for the Haleakala silversword. Using this model, I examined temporal and spatial variation in silversword demography. I also used the model to evaluate management strategies for the Haleakala silversword and the related subspecies, the endangered Mauna Kea silversword (Argyroxiphium sandwicense ssp. sandwicense). Using deterministic and stochastic models, I compared the relative impacts of different threats on silversword persistence, and weighed the relative effectiveness of different management options. The Haleakala silversword was self-incompatible, and percent seed set was positively correlated with annual flowering plant abundance. Individuals were pollen-limited only in low flowering years, suggesting a pollinator-mediated Allee effect in this species. Seeds remained viable in the field for multiple years, suggesting that a seed stage should be incorporated into the matrix model. Reproductive output (e. g., number of capitula and capitulum size) was strongly correlated with rosette diameter, allowing for size-based estimates of reproduction.

We used a plasmid test system in which reporter gene mRNA was measured to monitor rRNA antiterminator-dependent bypass of a Rho-dependent terminator. A comparison of terminator read-through in a wild-type Escherichia coli strain and that in a nusB::IS 10 mutant strain determined the requirement for NusB. In the absence of NusB, antiterminator-dependent terminator read-through was not detected, showing that NusB is necessary for rRNA transcription antitermination.

We performed 134 simulations where we systematically varied the {{equation of state}} {{as well as the}} mass ratio, neutron star mass, and aligned spin of the black hole. Using these simulations we have developed an analytic representation of the full inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform calibrated to these numerical waveforms, and we use this analytic waveform to estimate the accuracy to which Lambda can be measured with gravitational-wave detectors. We find that although the inspiral tidal signal is small, coherently combining this signal with the merger-ringdown matter effect improves the measurability of <b>Lambda</b> by a <b>factor</b> of ~ 3 over using just the merger-ringdown matter effect alone. However, incorporating correlations between all the waveform parameters then decreases the measurability of <b>Lambda</b> by a <b>factor</b> of ~ 3.

In the context of a VLSI model that equates hardware cost with physical volume, the routing algorithm can be used to demonstrate that fat-trees are universal routing networks. Specifically, we prove that any routing network can be efficiently simulated by a fat-tree of comparable hardware cost...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} classic Vehicle Routing Problem {{in the setting}} of {{stochastic}} optimization with recourse. StochVRP is a two-stage optimization problem, where demand is satisfied using two routes: fixed and recourse. The fixed route is computed using only a demand distribution. Then after observing the demand instantiations, a recourse route is computed [...] but costs here become more expensive by a <b>factor</b> <b>lambda.</b> We present an O(log^ 2 n log(n lambda)) -approximation algorithm for this stochastic routing problem, under arbitrary distributions. The main idea in this result is relating StochVRP to a special case of submodular orienteering, called knapsack rank-function orienteering. We also give a better approximation ratio for knapsack rank-function orienteering than what follows from prior work. Finally, we provide a Unique Games Conjecture based omega(1) hardness of approximation for StochVRP, even on star-like metrics on which our algorithm achieves a logarithmic approximation.

40|$|A {{classical}} {{problem in}} ergodic control consists of studying the limit {{behavior of the}} optimal value V_λ of a discounted cost functional with infinite horizon as the discount <b>factor</b> <b>lambda</b> tends to zero. In the literature, this problem has been addressed under various conditions ensuring that the rescaled value function λ V_λ converges uniformly to a constant limit. The main goal {{of this paper is}} to study this problem without such conditions, so that the aforementioned limit need not be constant. So, under a nonexpansivity assumption, we derive Lipschitz bounds which yield compactness of {λ V_λ} for both control systems and differential games. Then, we study the convergence of solutions to Hamilton–Jacobi equations under the hypothesis that the Hamiltonian is radially nondecreasing, hence allowing for the existence noncoercivity directions. Using PDE methods, we show that the convergence is monotone and we characterize the limit as the maximal subsolution of a certain Hamilton–Jacobi equation. Finally, we return to optimal control problems and differential games for nonexpansive dynamics obtaining explicit representation formulas for the uniform limit of λ V_λ as lambda→ 0...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} early active psoriatic lesions is the intraepidermal penetration of neutrophils, with attendant formation of Munro-Saboureau microabscesses. Previous immunofluorescence {{studies have shown}} reactivity of in vivo binding of stratum corneum antibodies (SCAs) within the Munro-Saboreau microabscesses in cases of psoriasis. Aims: In our study, we aimed to investigate any correlation between the SCAs and the Munro-Saboureau microabscesses. Materials and Methods: We investigated 50 archival biopsies of psoriasis with Munro-Saboureau microabscesses, and attempted to confirm antibody colocalization within these microabcesses via immunohistochemistry staining. As controls, we utilized 50 skin biopsies from healthy patients undergoing esthetic plastic surgery procedures. Results: Within the Munro-Saboureau microabscesses, the following markers were statistically significantly positive relative to controls: CD 1 a, CD 8, CD 23, cyclooxygenase- 2, myeloid histoid antigen, albumin, fibrinogen, kappa, <b>lambda,</b> von Willebrand <b>factor,</b> IgG, IgM, IgD, complement/C 3 c, C 3 d, myeloperoxidase, and carcinoembryonic antigen (P < 0. 05). Autoreactivity to blood vessels was also detected, with multiple immunoglobulins and complement factors. Conclusions: We document important correlations between the Munro-Saboureau microabscesses, SCAs, and other immunoreactants...|$|R
