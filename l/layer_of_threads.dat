5000|$|From the Nuclear Movement (founded in Milan in 1951 by Dangelo e Baj), Bianco {{gained a}} love of materials. In his works, the {{features}} of the faces become increasingly imperceptible, giving way to paint blends. His next progression was more radical, a composition of pigments, glass crystals, paint, glue, iridescent paste, and pebbles. [...] On the contrary, from Spatialism he captured the more creative, experimental, ironic and Dadaist dimension, taking interest in the materialistic trace and chromatic writing. The paintings are almost completely free of figures and become a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> and paint strokes.French critic Pierre Restany wrote: [...] "We should not forget that Remo Bianco was formed during the post - WWII period in the Milanese school of spatialism of Lucio Fontana and Carlo Cardazzo from which he drew the double lesson of energy and eclecticism - in one word, liberty".Regarding his relationship with Spatialism movement, Italian painter Virgilio Guidi in the presentation of the catalogue of his first solo exhibition, in 1952, at venetian [...] "Galleria del Cavallino" [...] directed by Carlo Cardazzo, defined him as an [...] "isolated spatialist" [...] spaziale isolato as well as a [...] "sensitive spatialist" [...] spaziale sensibile. Successively he held many exhibitions at Cavallino and Naviglio galleries, up to the Eighties.|$|E

30|$|The sheet-webs in our {{experiments}} were considerably {{larger than those}} found under more natural conditions, in some cases up to about 80 cm 2 (Figure  1 A). This demonstrates {{the capacity of the}} spiders’ silk glands. The thickness of these sheet-webs could not be assessed because various <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> were superimposed. The walls of a new diving bell (mounted by a polyethylene net with 0.8 mm mesh size on a microscope slide in water) were about 40 μm thick (n[*]=[*] 15). However, such a preparation did not represent a functionally intact diving bell wall, since the wall was not stretched by the internal pressure of the air volume. The real <b>layer</b> thickness <b>of</b> the diving bell’s wall should be far less, presumably about 10 μm, even if strengthened by further spinning secretions.|$|R
25|$|Each nest is {{occupied}} by several adult females. When a larva matures in its cell, it lays down a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> silk <b>threads</b> on the cell walls, then coats it with <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> a smooth and shiny substance, creating a sort of cocoon. The larva then defecates and smears its feces in vertical streaks {{on the inside of}} the cocoon to cover the lower half of the inner wall. This behavior is unique in E. imperialis, but the reason for its behavior is still unknown. Males, after emerging from their cells, leave immediately and have been observed to never re-enter the nest.|$|R
5000|$|Stitch-Bonding is {{a special}} form of warp {{knitting}} [...] and is commonly used {{for the production of}} composite materials and technical textiles. As a method of production, stitch-bonding is efficient, {{and is one of the}} most modern ways to create reinforced textiles and composite materials [...] for industrial use. The advantages of the stitch-bonding process includes its high productivity rate and the scope it offers for functional design of textiles, such as fiber-reinforced plastics. [...] Stitch-bonding involves <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> and fabric being joined together with a knitting thread, which creates a layered structure called a multi-ply. [...] This is created through a warp-knitting thread system, which is fixed on the reverse side of the fabric with a sinker loop, and a weft thread layer. [...] A needle with the warp thread passes through the material, which requires the warp and knitting threads to be moving both parallel and perpendicular to the vertical/warp direction of the stitch-bonding machine. [...] Stitch-bonded fabrics are currently being used in such fields as wind energy generation and aviation. [...] Research is currently being conducted into the usage and benefits of stitch-bonded fabrics as a way to reinforce concrete. Fabrics produced with this process offer the potential of using “sensitive fiber materials such as glass and carbon with only little damage, non-crimp fiber orientation and variable distance between threads”.|$|R

40|$|While {{threaded}} holes made by cutting taps result in material removal, in form tapping, the tap displaces the work material by plastic flow {{to form the}} thread section. The aim of the present work is to study, both experimentally and analytically, the 3 D-plastic flow in form tapping of low-alloy steels. An experimental technique for producing and measuring the 3 D displacement is proposed. Experimental results of displacements {{are used in the}} analytical analysis. The Green-Lagrange strain tensor is determined from the measurements obtained. The deviator stress tensor is calculated by using the constitutive law of the work material. The stress equilibrium allows the stress distribution resulting from the form tapping process.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{computationally}} intensive applications such as information retrieval, on-line analytical processing and data mining inherently require concurrency, because concurrent data maintenance, query processing and multi-user operation are functional requirements. Therefore, concurrent programming {{is a prerequisite for}} such systems. However, existing tools for parallel programming fail to meet these demands for concurrency and the adoption of parallel processing for these application domains is thus hindered. In this paper, we discuss the use <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> and concurrent programming constructs {{in the state of the}} art in parallel programming tools and environments. We find that the necessary functionality is available, but often in an inconvenient and unreliable manner. Due to the fact that the programmability and maintainability of parallel programs is a major concern, we consider the existing solutions inadequate or insufficient. We argue that an additional <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> middleware for <b>threads</b> and inter-thread communication and synchronization is necessary to support the effective development of persistently deployed parallel services for our targeted application domain and present the MPI Threads (MPIT) interface specification.

40|$|The life cicle of Latrodectus variegatus from cocoons {{collected}} in Bariloche, Argentina, is described. In stage IV (first free stage) 361 individually bred spiders were isolated and fed Drosophila melanogaster {{in the juvenile}} stage and Musca domestica after wards. "Stage I" is the stage following eclosion. For the study of survival, and average life expectancy, a week was taken as age interval, the first free stage was "age zero". The web is disordered, lacking a nest and located near the ground. The cocoon is pyriform, (similar to L. antheratus), but and with several <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> like L. mirabilis. It measures 14 - 18 mm, close to L. corallinus. The eggs are similar in size to other argentinian Lactrodectus. Each cocoon had a mean of 183 eggs (66 % fertile, N° = 549). In males, the number of moults to maturity is six in 78 % of the cases and seven in 22 % (similar to L. corallinus and L. antheratus). In females it is seven in 56 % of the cases, eight in 39 % and nine in 5 %. When compared with other argentinian species females L. variegatus appear to be missing one moult. There are two critical periods of mortality: in stage IV, when specimens begin their webs to capture food and in stage VII when the male life cycle ends. The survival curves for several Latrodectus show a high mortality in the first stages of development. Nevertheless, the survival curves of L. variegatus, L. corallinus and L. diaguita share a sharp descent in the first age intervals followed by a gradual decline. This abrupt decrease is not known for L. mirabilis and L. antheratus. The life expectancy at age zero and maximum longevity in L. Variegatus are 17. 32 and 73 weeks respectively, 9. 01 and 54 in L. mirabilis, 5. 36 and 81 in L. corallinus, 14. 76 and 100 in L. antheratus and 7. 76 and 62 in L. diaguita...|$|R

40|$|New {{applications}} for parallel computing in today’s data centers, such as online analytical processing, data mining or information retrieval, require support for concurrency.

While the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) defines a thread interface that is widely available, and while modern implementations of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) support threading, this combination is lacking in safety, security and reliability. The development of such parallel applications is therefore complex, difficult and error-prone. In response to this, we propose an additional <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> middleware for <b>threaded</b> MPI applications designed to simplify the development of concurrent parallel programs.

5000|$|According {{to the art}} {{historian}} Lawrence Stone (writing before {{the discovery of the}} Derrynaflan Hoard): [...] "Here the Irish artist has shown a capacity for classical restraint by a deliberate decision to prevent the ornamentation from spreading so copiously as to blur the proportions... contrasting markedly with the lavish ornamental spread of the almost contemporary Tara Brooch and the still more elaborate systems of the later period. The bulk of the decoration consists of exquisitely drawn spiral or interlace patterns, given depth by the soldering <b>of</b> two <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> gold <b>thread</b> {{one on top of the}} other. At intervals are set cloisonné enamel bosses of blue and red, the complicated manufacture of which shows direct continuity with the Anglo-Saxon jewellers' craft of the preceding century. But apart from the extraordinary perfection of execution of this elaborate decoration, what gives to the Ardagh Chalice its outstanding position in Irish metalwork is the strictness of the relationship between the simple swelling lines of the cup and its base and the arrangement of the glittering studs, bands, and roundels that adorn its surface."

40|$|We {{examined}} the webs of Linyphia triangularis (Clerck) and Microlinyphia pusilla (Sundevall) using light and scanning electronic microscopic techniques and compared {{them with the}} better known orb-webs. The linyphiid sheet-web consists of an unordered meshwork of fibres of different thicknesses. The sheet {{is connected to the}} scaffolding by the means of attachment discs. Thin threads with globules, which appear similar to the viscid silk droplets of orb-webs are present in most webs examined. Webs of M. pusilla had a higher density of these globules than did webs of L. triangularis. Webs of both species possess five types <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> connections and contain no aqueous glue for prey capture. Instead, unlike orb-webs, the sticky substances produced by the linyphiid aggregate glands cement the different <b>layers</b> and <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> the sheet by drying up after being produced. Due to the function, sheet webs may not require viscid silk, thereby leading to a more economic web.

5000|$|The next {{breakthrough}} in golf ball development came in 1898. Coburn Haskell of Cleveland, Ohio had driven to nearby Akron, Ohio for a golf date with Bertram Work, {{the superintendent of}} the B.F. Goodrich Company. While he waited in the plant for Work, Haskell picked up some rubber thread and wound it into a ball. When he bounced the ball, it flew almost to the ceiling. Work suggested Haskell put a cover on the creation, {{and that was the}} birth of the 20th century wound golf ball that would soon replace the guttie bramble ball. The new design became known as the rubber Haskell golf ball. For decades, the wound rubber ball consisted of a liquid-filled or solid round core that was wound with a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> rubber <b>thread</b> into a larger round inner core and then covered with a thin outer shell made of balata sap. The balata is a tree native to Central and South America and the Caribbean. The tree is tapped and the soft, viscous fluid released is a rubber-like material similar to gutta-percha, which was found to make an ideal cover for a golf ball. Balata, however, is relatively soft. If the leading edge of a highly lofted short iron contacts a balata-covered ball in a location other than the bottom of the ball a cut or [...] "smile" [...] will often be the result, rendering the ball unfit for play in most instances.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} the in situ {{substrate}} nitridation time on the electrical, structural and optical properties of GaN films grown on Si(111) substrates by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) was investigated. A thin buffer <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> silicon nitride (SiNx) with various thicknesses was achieved through the nitridation of the substrate at different nitridation times ranging from 0 to 660 s. The surface roughness of the GaN film, which was grown on the Si substrate 10 s, exhibited a root mean square (RMS) value of 1. 12 nm for the surface roughness. However, further increments in the nitridation times in turn cause increments in the surface roughness in the GaN <b>layers.</b> The number <b>of</b> <b>threading</b> dislocation (TD) was counted from plan-view TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) images. The determined density <b>of</b> these <b>threading</b> dislocations was <b>of</b> the order of 9 × 109  cm- 2. The sheet resistances <b>of</b> the GaN <b>layers</b> were measured. The average sheet resistance significantly increases from 2867  Ω sq- 1 for sample A (without nitridation) to 8124  Ω sq- 1 for sample F (with 660  s nitridation). The photoluminescence (PL) measurements of the samples nitridated at various nitridation times were done at a temperature range of 10 - 300 K. A strong band edge PL emission line, which was centered at approx. 3. 453 eV along with its phonon replicas which was separated by approx. 92 meV in successive orders, was observed at 10 K. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of this peak is approx. 14 meV, which indicates the reasonable optical quality of the GaN epilayers grown on Si substrate. At room temperature, the peak position and FWHM of this emission became 3. 396 eV and 58 meV, respectively. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

GaN layers were epitaxially grown on the PSS under the optimized 2 -step growth condition of metalorganic vapor deposition. During the 1 st growth step, GaN layers with triangular cross sections were grown on the selected area of {{the surface of the}} PSS, and in the 2 nd growth step, the GaN layers were laterally grown and coalesced with neighboring GaN <b>layers.</b> The density <b>of</b> <b>threading</b> dislocations {{on the surface of the}} coalesced GaN layer was 2 ~ 4 × 107 cm- 2 over the entire region. The epitaxial structure of near-UV light emitting diode (LED) was grown over the GaN layers on the PSS. The internal quantum efficiency and the extraction efficiency of the LED structure grown on the PSS were remarkably increased when compared to the conventional LED structure grown on the flat sapphire substrate. The reduction in TD density and the decrease in the number of times of total internal reflections of the light flux are mainly attributed due to high level of scattering on the PSS.

40|$|Words as I {{have known}} them are {{evolving}} concepts {{in the landscape}} of human language, where the meanings of words are interwoven with <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> history and culture. The boundaries of language are defined by words, and around the edges are instinctive sounds that precede and exceed meaning. These sounds are an interrupting force that unsettles the linguistic structure. We often use them for expression {{in the form of}} sobs, grunts, moans, murmurs, chants, obscenities and exclamations. They appear in times of spontaneous emotion that words cannot convey. They can also be used purposely, poetically, “…to shatter [one’s] judging consciousness in order to grant passage through it to this rhythmic drive…and, once filtered by language and its meaning, experienced as jouissance. 2 ̆ 2 I think of jouissance as a subversively sensual, mental, emotional, physical experience that disrupts consciousness. It flows in waves, like sound. It carries one beyond meaning to a bodily experience that cannot be contained by words. For codified language holds constructed ideologies, and we use it to describe ourselves to one another – to construct an identity. Language becomes flat, rigid and predictable when it stays within the boundaries of established ideologies. Therefore, it is vital to keep it alive by allowing it to be unsettled, to allow room for meaning to change. I explore this concept of disruption through journals that transform into drawings evoking rhythmic sound, natural forms and decorative motifs. I begin with words dissolving into matter in pages of personal journals. The paper is tattered through the process of writing with flammable liquids and then stitching the fragments together. As words fall away, lines <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> and color take their place. The threads consume the paper and ash, and it becomes a new material. The fibers of text dissolve, or they are trapped in the <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>thread,</b> and they become palimpsests containing the history of what they were within the actuality of what they are. This physical history is embedded in the fibers, replacing the symbolic meaning of words with a material otherness. The repetitive lines <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> form a new structure containing linear drawings. Now, the line of thought is visible as one image. The drawings were etched and printed on silk, and they reference the thread lines that emerge from the ashes of the pages. A single line loops in and around itself in a cyclical path that begins at one point and accretes <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> repetitive spirals and spikes. The line is driven by a rhythmic sense of disorder, unbalance, and asymmetry. As expressive energy, the lines resemble plants, birds, insects and fossils, although they are not any of these things. The organic forms reflect the inherent principles of design that govern natural growth, including ourselves: “We spin into life in the womb as a spiral embryo. We are conscious energy systems that whirl into configuration as other natural energies do along spiral lines of force, unfurling into life along an endless path of spiral transformation. ” 2 There is a tension between order and disorder, creation and destruction in how the material shifts from woven to unraveling matter. The process of making these drawings is a meditative one. I use a library of spiraling gestures in both deliberate and spontaneous formats. I react to intuition by intentionally drawing in one mode, but I also impulsively interrupt the designs by changing the rhythm or direction of the line. It is a dance between the hand and mind guided by inner sounds or vibrations; an emotive stream of consciousness manifest in a physical format. This process of drawing is analogous to the journaling from which it stems, for both practices make space for interior dialogue. It is a dialogue with the influences in my life. I see the influence of nature and music, as well as the decorative patterns and methods of sewing that I inherit from my mother. Some of my earliest memories are of sewing cross-stitch with her. She would push the needle in and I would pull it through. This physical interaction between us made an image on the fabric. It was a conversation between two hands. I return to that conversation, and of finding a feminine perspective by sewing away the fragments of paper to construct a material <b>of</b> line and <b>thread.</b> There is a long tradition in art history of turning inward for wordless expression. Wassily Kandinsky emphasized music in his non-objective art, the Abstract Expressionists sought interior psychological truths, and Surrealists employed automatic drawings to unveil the inner psyche. I want to link this idea to the thought of the body as a source of knowing – of “embodied knowledge,” as artist Ann Hamilton explains it. I also feel that many unnamed individuals draw from this inner source through “mere” decoration – I think of the women in India who daily paint patterns outside their homes in the earth as ephemeral rituals of time passed from day to day, as well as to mark milestones like birth, adolescence and marriage. They reflect the passage of time, decay and regeneration, and the perpetual cycles of these processes. There is an undercurrent of wordless energy that I try to know in the physical, bodily sense of knowing, and I try to convey that energy through a sensory experience. I hope for the viewer to find his or her own introspection within this work, perhaps a wave of jouissance. Advisor: Karen Kun...|$|R
