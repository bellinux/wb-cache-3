I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt.

500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "You and I" [...] {{is set in}} common time with a slow tempo of 60 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A major. During the song Gaga's voice spans from the notes of E3 to C5. The song begins with an A–G–A chord progression, which changes to A–Bm/A–D/A–Bm during the chorus, {{and back to the}} former chords afterwards. The opening lyrics—"It's been a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> I came around/ It's been a long time, but I'm back in town/ And this time, I'm not leaving without you"—describe a whiskey-breathed lover for whom she is pining. Gil Kaufman of MTV News described it as the [...] "tune eschewed most of her dance flavor, right down to a rollicking barrel-house piano solo." [...] Her voice sounded like growling during the main verses, where she sings the lines: [...] "He said, 'Sit back down where you belong, in the corner of my bar with your high heels on, Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time..." [...] Noting the differences between live performances of the song and the studio version, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph observed that the piano parts were replaced mostly by [...] "fizzing synths, a stomping beat sampled from [...] "We Will Rock You", thundering electric guitars and backing vocals stacked into shimmering choral walls." [...] Kitty Empire of The Guardian described the song as an [...] "umlaut-toting digital country power ballad" [...] with two Bruce Springsteen references: [...] "born to run" [...] and Nebraska.|$|E

[...] "Little Steven Spielberg is all grown up now...into of all things a superior film artist...It's too early to know whether Minority Report, {{on the heels of}} A.I., marks a brief detour in Spielberg's career or a permanent change of course, but either way it's a dark and dazzling spectacle." [...] J. Hoberman of The Village Voice said it is [...] "the most entertaining, least pretentious genre movie Steven Spielberg has made in the decade since Jurassic Park." [...] Randy Shulman of Metro Weekly said that [...] "the movie is a huge leap forward for the director, who moves once and for all into the world of adult movie making." [...] Roger Ebert called the film a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and said that when most directors of the period were putting [...] "their trust in technology", Spielberg had already mastered it, and was emphasizing [...] "story and character" [...] while merely using technology as a [...] "workman uses his tools". David Edelstein of Slate echoed the positive sentiments, saying [...] "t has been a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> a Spielberg film felt so nimble, so unfettered, so free of self-cannibalizing." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum, then of the Chicago Reader, was less convinced. Though he approved of the movie, he derided it in his review as a superficial action film, cautioning audiences to enjoy the movie, but not [...] "be conned into thinking that some sort of serious, thoughtful statement is being delivered along with the roller-coaster ride." ...|$|E

Plant recovery and succession following disturbance are poorly understood in arid lands relative to more temperate regions. This study quantitatively reviewed vegetation reestablishment following {{a variety of}} disturbances in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts of southwestern North America. A total of 47 studies met inclusion criteria for the review. The time estimated by 29 individual studies for full reestablishment of total perennial plant cover was 76 years. Although <b>long,</b> this <b>time</b> was shorter than an estimated 215 years (among 31 individual studies) required for the recovery of species composition typical of undisturbed areas, assuming that recovery remains linear following the <b>longest</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> disturbance measurement made by the studies...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} if and to {{what extent}} patients with a transtibial amputation are less successful in avoiding unexpected obstacles while walking than healthy adults. DESIGN: Experimental 2 -group design. SETTING: Dutch rehabilitation center. PARTICIPANTS: Eleven patients with a transtibial amputation and 14 healthy controls. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subjects walked on a treadmill at. 56 m/s. In 2 series of 12 trials each, an obstacle was dropped in front of the prosthetic or the nonprosthetic leg of the amputation group and the left leg of the control group at different phases during the step cycle. It was noted which avoidance strategy was used (a long step strategy [LSS] or a short step strategy [SSS]) and whether the obstacle was avoided successfully or not. These data were expressed {{as a percentage of the}} total number of trials completed by each subject. RESULTS: With either leg, the amputation group made significantly more errors than the control subjects (prosthetic leg, 24 %+/- 17 %; nonprosthetic leg, 21 %+/- 17 % vs 2 %+/- 2 % for the control group). Highest failure rates were in the amputation group when time pressure was high, requiring an SSS, especially on the prosthetic side. An LSS under time pressure, however, nearly always resulted in failure for both the prosthetic and nonprosthetic legs. Subjects with the <b>longest</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> amputation were most successful in avoiding unexpected obstacles. CONCLUSIONS: Under time pressure, patients with a lower-leg prosthesis perform best when they use their nonprosthetic leg as the lead limb in an SSS. The fact that some subjects with the <b>longest</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> amputation made no errors suggests that over many years it is possible to relearn the appropriate avoidance reactions sufficiently fast...|$|R
