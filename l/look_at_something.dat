25|$|The {{spinning}} sensation experienced from BPPV {{is usually}} triggered by {{movement of the}} head, will have a sudden onset, and can last anywhere from {{a few seconds to}} several minutes. The most common movements patients report triggering a spinning sensation are tilting their heads upwards in order to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>something,</b> and rolling over in bed.|$|E
25|$|After the screening, the {{two couples}} stayed outside the theatre {{for a while}} but {{separated}} about 23:15. Olof and Lisbet Palme headed south {{on the west side}} of Sveavägen, towards the northern entrance of the Hötorget metro station. When they reached the Adolf Fredrik Church, they crossed Sveavägen and continued on the street's east side. They stopped a moment to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>something</b> in a shop window, continued past the Dekorima shop which was then located on the corner of Sveavägen and Tunnelgatan, and headed for the metro station entrance on the other side of Tunnelgatan. At 23:21, halfway across the street and only a few metres from the station entrance, a man appeared from behind, shot Mr. Palme at point-blank range and fired a second shot at Mrs. Palme. The perpetrator then jogged down Tunnelgatan street, up the steps to Malmskillnadsgatan and continued down David Bagares gata , where he was last seen.|$|E
500|$|She and I {{sat down}} and wrote this song about some serious insecurities that we had {{when we first started}} down this road with each other, and we both had trust issues. We were getting over it, but we wrote this song about it. And it's perfect. I couldn't be happier about that song and the way it came about and the honest way ... It is like people getting a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>something</b> {{personal}} for the first time.|$|E

When you get footage like that, you realise that your job is really not technical. It was my job to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>something</b> that Emma Thompson had done and say, 'Eh, that's not good, I'll use this other one instead.' And not only was I allowed to pass {{judgment}} on these tremendous actors, I was required to." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the multi-platinum and award-winning {{success of}} her eponymous debut album in 2006, Corinne Bailey Rae {{began to work}} on songs for a {{follow-up}} album {{at the end of}} 2007. She took a hiatus from music, however, after the death of her husband, Scottish saxophonist Jason Rae, in March 2008 to an accidental overdose of methadone and alcohol. For a long period of time, Rae said, [...] "I didn't really hear any songs. Normally in my everyday life, I'd be in the car {{and come up with a}} little line, or I'd <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>something</b> and try to describe it ... I didn't really think in that way anymore. Nothing was coming in." [...] After months of grief and isolation, Rae revisited her work the following year and composed additional material for The Sea.|$|E
2500|$|The {{nature and}} causes of this transformation, which largely {{took place during}} late antiquity, have been a subject of {{scholarly}} debate for centuries. Giorgio Vasari attributed it {{to a decline in}} artistic skills and standards, which had in turn been revived by his contemporaries in the Italian Renaissance. Although this point of view has been occasionally revived, most notably by Bernard Berenson, modern scholars tend to take a more positive view of the Byzantine aesthetic. Alois Riegl and Josef Strzygowski, writing in the early 20th century, were above all responsible for the revaluation of late antique art. Riegl saw it as a natural development of pre-existing tendencies in Roman art, whereas Strzygowski viewed it as a product of [...] "oriental" [...] influences. Notable recent contributions to the debate include those of Ernst Kitzinger, who traced a [...] "dialectic" [...] between [...] "abstract" [...] and [...] "Hellenistic" [...] tendencies in late antiquity, and John Onians, who saw an [...] "increase in visual response" [...] in late antiquity, through which a viewer [...] "could <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>something</b> which was in twentieth-century terms purely abstract and find it representational." ...|$|E

60|$|She {{said she}} did not want help, {{nevertheless}} allowed him to help her on the unshod side.

60|$|Mr. George and Rollo {{walked on}} along a narrow road, which was bordered by queer, picturesque-looking huts and cottages on either hand, with gardens by {{the sides of}} them, in which women and girls were hoeing or weeding. They met two or three parties of ladies and gentlemen {{returning}} from the Staubach; and presently {{they came to a}} place where, close {{to the side of the}} road, was a small shop, before which a party of ladies and gentlemen had stopped, apparently to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>something</b> curious.|$|E
6000|$|The other {{picture was}} that of a man nailed to a cross, which {{surprised}} Tom much. He fancied that he had seen something like it in a shop-window. But why was it there?

Perhaps it was some kinsman of hers, who had been murdered by the savages in foreign parts, and she kept it there for a remembrance." [...] And Tom felt sad, and awed, and turned to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>something</b> else.|$|E

60|$|Rollo, {{understanding}} the gesture, {{though not the}} words, turned in the direction that Carlos indicated, and {{saw that there was}} quite a crowd of men, women, and children at the place, all engaged, evidently, in <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>something</b> or other very intently.|$|R
