5000|$|Pé de moleque (...) (literally [...] "boy's foot" [...] in Portuguese) is a {{traditional}} candy from the Brazilian cuisine made of peanuts and jaggery or molasses. The origin of its name {{lies in the fact}} that most paved streets of colonial Brazil were made by laying down various odd rocks in a <b>loose</b> <b>layer</b> of sand, and having street children stomp on them to flatten the surface. While cobblestone streets are called rua de paralelepípedos and unpaved streets rua de barro (literally, [...] "clay street"), those made by the method described above came to be named pé de moleque. Since the appearance of the peanuts stuck together by molasses was found to be similar to that of these type of street, the candy took the same name.The candy is prepared by mixing roasted, peeled peanuts with melted brown sugar or rapadura, with or without the addition of macerated peanuts as well. The mixture is gently stirred over low heat until it gets close to crystallizing. Then the mixture is placed on a plain stone or metal surface (preferably thinly oiled with butter to ease removal) in pieces similar in size to cookies. This traditional preparation results in soft, irregularly-shaped sweets of a dark brown color. Softness results from the incorporation of peanut oil.|$|E

The {{objective of this}} study was to construct a scaffold with gradient porosity and drug distribution and evaluate the effect of scaffold structure on drug release kinetics and cell bioactivity. Nano-hydroxyapatite/collagen/phosphatidylserine scaffolds embedded with steroidal saponin loaded collagen microparticles were prepared using a porogen leaching protocol. Morphological characterization showed that the scaffolds consisted of dense layer and <b>loose</b> <b>layer,</b> and pores were interconnective. The microparticles were entrapped at the center of the scaffolds follow a gradient distribution. Release kinetics correlated with the structure. The <b>loose</b> <b>layer</b> showed greater drug release amount as compared to the dense layer. Such differences in release kinetics have distinct effects on cell bioactivity. Cell proliferated much more in <b>loose</b> <b>layer</b> than that in the dense layer. Such spatial and temporal control over drug deposition and delivery within the scaffolds could provide opportunities for tissue regeneration associated with optimum drug doses at wound site, and lessen undesirable drug release and side-effects at uninjured site...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Theories of soil {{mechanics}} and basic hydraulic relations {{and principles of}} loose boundary channel hydraulics were combined and integrated to analyze stratified river bank failure due to undercutting (undermining) of a bottom <b>loose</b> <b>layer.</b> A near bank velocity distribution model was developed from which the boundary shear stress acting on the bank surface was determined. The model allows computation of the eroded soil volume from the bottom <b>loose</b> <b>layer</b> and the lateral undercut distance {{at any time in}} the flow hydrograph as long as the induced flow shear stress is greater than the particle critical shear stress resistance to hydraulic entrainment. At failure the size of the failure block and the ultimate critical value of the lateral undercut distance are determined. Therefore the annual rate of bank retreat and bank sediment load contribution can be identified for the reach under consideration. The application of the model to the River Nile hydrograph in Northern Sudan State showed a good agreement with field observations...|$|E

40|$|Fouling {{behaviour}} and {{its impact}} on the rejection of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) by forward osmosis (FO) were investigated. Membrane fouling was simulated using humic acid and colloidal particles asmodel foulants at different initial permeatewater fluxes. Water flux declinewas insignificant at an initial permeate flux of 9 L/m 2 h and the fouling layerwas loose and fluid-like. By contrast, thewater flux declinewas substantial at an initial permeate flux of 20 L/m 2 h, resulting in the formation of a compact fouling layer. Water flux recovery after physical cleaning for both humic acid and colloidal particle fouledmembraneswas consistently higher at an initial permeate flux of 9 L/m 2 h compared to 20 L/m 2 h. The results suggest that the fouling layer structure varied froma fluidlike <b>loose</b> <b>layer</b> at lowinitial permeate flux to amore cohesive and compact layer at high initial permeate flux. We surmise that the fluid-like <b>loose</b> <b>layer</b> formed at low initial permeate flux contributed to pore blockage and thus enhanced steric hindrance, thereby leading to an increase in TrOC rejection. By contrast, the cohesive and compact fouling layer formed at high initial permeate flux exacerbated cake-enhanced concentration polarisation, resulting in a decrease in TrOC rejection...|$|E
