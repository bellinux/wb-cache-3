5|$|Phosphorus {{could be}} {{intentionally}} introduced into diamond grown by {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) at concentrations up to ~0.01%. Phosphorus substitutes carbon in the diamond lattice. Similar to nitrogen, phosphorus has one more electron than carbon and thus acts as a donor; however, the ionization energy of phosphorus (0.6 eV) is much smaller than that of nitrogen (1.7 eV) and is small enough for room-temperature thermal ionization. This important property of phosphorus in diamond favors electronic applications, such as UV <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diodes</b> (LEDs, at 235nm).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the heat {{transfer}} and structural stress analysis of the micro- scale packaging structure of a high-power <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diode.</b> The thermal-effect and thermal-stress of <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diode</b> are determined numerically. <b>Light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diode</b> {{is attached to the}} silicon substrate through the wire bonding process by using epoxy as die bond material. The silicon substrate is etched with holes at the bottom and filled with high conductivity copper material. The chip temperature and structure stress increase with input power consumption. The micro <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diode</b> is mounted on the heat sink to increase the heat dissipation performance, to decrease chip temperature, to enhance the material structure reliability and safety, and to avoid structure failure as well.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the micro-shear bond {{strength}} of composite resin cured with halogen visible light and blue <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diode</b> curing units. Flat enamel surfaces of 50 segments of teeth were prepared. 50 cylindrical composite resin specimens were bonded to the prepared teeth segments. Specimens were divided into 5 groups, three groups were cured for 10, 20 and 40 seconds using blue <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diode</b> and 2 groups were cured for 20 and 40 seconds using halogen light. Specimens were submitted to micro-shear bond test at 1 mm / min cross-head speed. Mean micro-shear bond strengths were analyzed by analysis of variance (One-way ANOVA) and Tukey's test at P< 0. 05. At 40 seconds curing, the halogen light produced significantly higher bond strength than that of blue <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diode.</b> No significant difference was found between both lights at 20 seconds. There were no significant differences in bond strength ratios between 10 and 20 seconds blue <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diode,</b> and 20 seconds halogen light. At 40 seconds, the blue <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diode</b> produced significantly higher bond strength than that of blue <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diode</b> at 10 and 20 seconds, and halogen light at 20 seconds. It was concluded that despite the higher micro-shear bond strength of halogen light at 40 seconds, blue <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diode</b> curing unit provided sufficient output to exceed minimum requirements in terms of composites’ micro-shear bond strength according to ISO 11405, 1994. During incremental application of composite resin, 10 seconds blue <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diode</b> curing time is sufficient to produce acceptable micro-shear bond strength values...|$|R

5|$|ZnO has wide direct {{band gap}} (3.37 eV or 375nm at room temperature). Therefore, its most common {{potential}} applications are in laser diodes and <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diodes</b> (LEDs). Some optoelectronic applications of ZnO overlap with that of GaN, which has a similar bandgap (~3.4 eV at room temperature). Compared to GaN, ZnO has a larger exciton binding energy (~60 meV, 2.4 times of the room-temperature thermal energy), which results in bright room-temperature emission from ZnO. ZnO can be combined with GaN for LED-applications. For instance as transparent conducting oxide layer and ZnO nanostructures provide better light outcoupling. Other properties of ZnO favorable for electronic applications include its stability to high-energy radiation and its possibility to be patterned by wet chemical etching. Radiation resistance makes ZnO a suitable candidate for space applications.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Trichophyton rubrum is {{the most}} common agent of {{superficial}} mycosis of the skin and nails causing long lasting infections and high recurrence rates. Current treatment drawbacks involve topical medications not being able to reach the nail bed at therapeutic concentrations, systemic antifungal drugs failing to eradicate the fungus before the nails are renewed, severe side effects and selection of resistant fungal isolates. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been a promising alternative to conventional treatments. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the in vitro effectiveness of toluidine blue O (TBO) irradiated by <b>Light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (LED) in the reduction of T. rubrum viability. METHODS: The fungal inoculums' was prepared and exposed to different TBO concentrations and energy densities of <b>Light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diode</b> for evaluate the T. rubrum sensibility to PDT and production effect fungicidal after photodynamic treatment. In addition, the profiles of the area and volume of the irradiated fungal suspensions were also investigated. RESULTS: A small reduction, in vitro, of fungal cells was observed after exposition to 100 µM toluidine blue O irradiated by 18 J/cm² <b>Light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diode.</b> Fungicidal effect occurred after 25 µM toluidine blue O irradiation by <b>Light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diode</b> with energy density of 72 J/cm².
