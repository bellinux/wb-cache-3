Based on this, this system {{was classified as}} Tropical Depression Nine on August 13. The depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm and was named Hilary. The system gradually accelerated to the northwest and reached its peak strength on August 15 with winds of 60mph (95km/h). Tropical Storm Hilary then started a gradual weakening trend. It became a depression on August 16, turned a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> westward, and dissipated on August 17. Hilary never came near land, and as such caused no death or damage.|$|E
5|$|It was {{something}} we wanted to wrap {{up to a certain}} extent. It's a disservice to Rick's character to make him look like he's completely clueless. But this isn't really a resolution per se. It makes things a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> tense, moving into this next episode. Seeing Rick interact with Shane will have an extra level of tension because now the audience has one up on Shane as opposed to one up on Rick. It’s going to be fun waiting for the other shoe to drop, when Rick may or may not confront Shane with this information.|$|E
5|$|Infamous is an action-adventure game set {{in an open}} world {{environment}} and played from a third-person perspective where the player controls Cole and primarily interacts {{with the world of}} Empire City through Cole's newly gained electricity-based powers; these are used for movement, offense and defense in combat, and either for better or worse in dealing with the citizens of Empire City. In order for Cole to use his powers, he must have stored electrical power, represented by a node meter on the player's heads up display (HUD). The player can recharge Cole by draining electricity from powered sources or from living beings; recharging also restores Cole's health, which is indicated by blood splattering onto the screen. The more damage that Cole takes, the more blood that covers the screen. When Cole's health is at a critical level, the screen will turn black and white, and if Cole takes a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> damage while the screen is black and white, a heartbeat will be heard and will get slower and slower as Cole takes more damage, until it is beating dangerously slow. At this point, further damage to Cole will kill him. If the player stays out of battle long enough, Cole's health will regenerate over time. The game features seventeen different electrical powers, ranging from simple bolts that do not consume Cole's energy to wide-field lightning storms that drain most of Cole's energy. The player can use such powers, giving the player options in certain situations. For example, the player may fire at a generator near foes to cause it to explode and cripple his opponents, then restrain them or fire at the body to kill the enemy.|$|E
50|$|Kermanshah has {{a climate}} which is heavily {{influenced}} by {{the proximity of the}} Zagros mountains, classified as a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa). The city's altitude and exposed location relative to westerly winds makes precipitation a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> high (<b>more</b> than twice that of Tehran), {{but at the same time}} produces huge diurnal temperature swings especially in the virtually rainless summers, which remain extremely hot during the day. Kermanshah experiences rather cold winters and there are usually rainfalls in fall and spring. Snow cover is seen for at least a couple of weeks in winter.|$|R

25|$|Phylogeny {{can give}} {{some sense of}} history when {{combined}} with a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> information. Each difference in the DNA indicates divergence between one species and another. This divergence, whether via drift or natural selection, is representative of some lapse of time. Comparing DNA sequences alone gives {{a record of the}} history of evolution with an arbitrary measure of phylogenetic distance “dating” that last common ancestor. However, if information about the rate of genetic mutation is available or geologic markers are present to calibrate evolutionary divergence (i.e. fossils), we have a timeline of evolution. From there, with an idea about other contemporaneous changes in life and environment, we can begin to speculate why certain evolutionary paths might have been selected for.|$|E

Showrunner Sam Catlin was interviewed for the segment, and stated [...] "Cassidy's sort of figured out that DeBlanc and Fiore aren't vampire vigilantes. Now he realises {{what they want is}} Jesse's power." [...] Catlin then acknowledges that Cassidy is rather curious of the two fellows, stating, [...] "At first he just wants to know a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> about <b>more</b> about what it is that they want and what are they after; and sort of over the course of that scene, he realises that they don't seem they have all the answers." ...|$|R

500|$|They {{sought to}} make Enterprise more {{character}} driven than the previous series in the Star Trek franchise, and hoped that this would gain viewers who had watched The Next Generation but had lost interest with Deep Space Nine and Voyager. It was intended to link the series directly into The Original Series by having T'Pau as a main character, who had previously appeared in the episode [...] "Amok Time". Instead, this character was developed into an original Vulcan character, T'Pol. Berman explained his vision for the series at launch, saying that [...] "we'll be seeing humanity when they truly are going where no man has gone before. We are seeing people who don't take meeting aliens as just {{another part of the}} job. It's not routine. Nothing is routine. Also, by bringing it back 200 years from Voyager, we're making the characters closer to the present, and by doing that they can be a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> accessible and a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> flawed and a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> familiar to you and me." ...|$|E

50|$|The front fascias of the Chevy Suburban and GMC Yukon XL are distinct, {{but from}} the base of the A-pillars back, they share most of the same styling cues. This now {{includes}} inlaid doors that tuck into the door sills, instead of over them, improving aerodynamics, fuel economy, and lessens interior noise. The hoods and liftgate panels are made of aluminum in an effort to reduce vehicle weight, and the wiper blades that was located on the liftgate door is moved to the rear spoiler located on the top of the rear liftgate window. Also noticeable is the SUV's length, which expands from 222.4 in to 224.4 in (the Yukon XL's length is shorter at 224.3 in) and its width from 79.1 in to 80.5 in, while the height decreases from 76.8 in to 74.4 in, thus allowing the vehicle to become slightly leaner, a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> wider, <b>more</b> streamlined, and roomier.|$|R

Visual effects supervisor Stephane Ceretti, who also worked on Guardians of the Galaxy, explained {{the similarities and differences}} between the two films, saying, [...] "there's some resemblance in {{some of the things that}} we've done.

The team steps up. We narrow the gap to try to pick him up knowing he's not going to be there, and we start winning races, even with a driver that is not 100 percent.

Keyboard programming was done by Eric Kupper. According to Simpson, [...] "the message behind the song is for guys {{to listen to the}} girl".
