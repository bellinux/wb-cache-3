25|$|Wagner {{wrote of}} his preoccupations with Schopenhauer and Tristan {{in a letter}} to Franz Liszt (December 16, 1854): Never in my life having enjoyed the true {{happiness}} of <b>love</b> <b>I</b> shall erect a memorial to this loveliest of all dreams in which, from the first to the last, love shall, for once, find utter repletion. I have devised in my mind a Tristan und Isolde, the simplest, yet most full-blooded musical conception imaginable, and with the ‘black flag’ that waves at the end I shall cover myself over – to die.|$|E
25|$|Iolanthe premiered {{only three}} days after Patience closed at the Savoy. The Savoy Theatre, opened only a year earlier, was a {{state-of-the-art}} facility, the first theatre {{in the world to}} be lit entirely by electricity. Patience had transferred to the Savoy from the Opera Comique, upon the theatre's opening, but Iolanthe was the first show to premiere at the theatre. New lighting technologies made such special effects as sparkling fairy wands possible for the first time. The principal fairies' heads were also lit by wreaths of small illuminated stars attached to a battery. The audience that attended the opening night in London included Captain (later Captain Sir) Eyre Massey Shaw, head of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, whom the Fairy Queen apostrophises in the second act ("Oh, Captain Shaw / Type of true love kept under / Could thy brigade with cold cascade / Quench my great <b>love,</b> <b>I</b> wonder?"). On the first night Alice Barnett, as the Queen of the Fairies, sang the verses directly to Captain Shaw, who was sitting in the centre of the stalls.|$|E

500|$|The {{themes of}} the album are {{reflected}} in the album cover designed by Alexander McQueen. Björk approached McQueen explaining to him the person who wrote Homogenics songs was someone who [...] "had to become a warrior. A warrior who had to fight not with weapons, but with <b>love.</b> <b>I</b> had 10 kilos of hair on my head, and special contact lenses and a manicure that prevented me from eating with my fingers, and gaffer tape around my waist and high clogs so I couldn't walk easily".|$|E
500|$|During the trial, Lhermitte {{testified that}} {{her role as}} wife and mother was {{disrupted}} by having the middle-aged Belgian doctor, Michel Schaar, {{living in the same}} house as part of the family. According to Lhermitte, Scharr accompanied her and Moqadem on their honeymoon and stayed in their room. Lhermitte stated, [...] "We [...] had to wait until he fell asleep before we could make <b>love.</b> <b>I</b> found that weird but Bouchaib said he regarded him as his stepfather. I think the doctor loved my husband in a platonic way." ...|$|E
500|$|The third track, [...] "Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through", is {{a prayer}} to rock music, celebrating {{how it is}} always there to help you through troubled times. One of its lyrics is [...] "You're never alone, 'cause you can put on the 'phones and let the drummer tell your heart what to do." [...] The fourth track also has dark overtones. [...] "It Just Won't Quit", Steinman explains, [...] "is {{about the fact that}} there are some things you never shake off... That's <b>love,</b> <b>I</b> guess." [...] "Out of the Frying Pan (And into the Fire)" [...] is a more upbeat song.|$|E

500|$|Given little {{instruction}} from the studio, screenwriter Deborah Moggach spent {{over two years}} adapting Pride and Prejudice for film. She had sole discretion with the early script, and eventually wrote approximately ten drafts. Realising it held [...] "a perfect three-act structure", Moggach attempted to be as faithful to the original novel as possible, calling it [...] "so beautifully shaped as a story – the ultimate romance about two {{people who think they}} hate each other but who are really passionately in <b>love.</b> <b>I</b> felt, 'If it's not broken, don't fix it.'" [...] While she could not reproduce the novel's [...] "fiercely wonderful dialogue in its entirety", she attempted to keep much of it.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics {{speak of}} a love connection, where the protagonist makes bad decisions; [...] "I never was smart with <b>love,</b> <b>I</b> let the bad ones in and the good ones go". In the chorus, Robyn sings [...] "I'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt before/I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible." [...] Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music noted that Robyn sings [...] "tough and knowing" [...] and [...] "pessimistically optimistic" [...] lines, but manages {{to make it sound}} romantic for the listener. Emma Gaedekke of Billboard commented on the lyrical content, saying, [...] "Robyn's heartfelt vocal turn {{prevents}} the backing music from overwhelming her story of a love connection found at the tail-end of heartbreak." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} narrates the {{difficulties}} of finding and maintaining love. Cristin Maher of Taste of Country contended that the song exemplifies the desire some people have {{when they want to}} make the move from a physical relationship to an emotional relationship, which is represented by the song lyrics [...] "Let’s take it slow, I don’t want to move too fast / I don’t wanna just make <b>love,</b> <b>I</b> wanna make love last." [...] Gibson, one of the writers of the song, stated that the song does not contain a lot of flowery lyrics or sentiment. He added, [...] "It’s just straight up what somebody would say to somebody they’d want to be with." ...|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{wrote and}} {{produced}} the song with Steve Bray. According to her, [...] "True Blue" [...] takes its title from a favourite expression of her then husband Sean Penn {{and to his}} very pure vision of love and was a direct tribute to him {{as well as the}} album, which was as a whole inspired by her [...] "unabashed valentine" [...] for Penn. In an interview, Bray said, [...] "She [...] was very much in love. It was obvious if she's in love she'll write love songs. If she's not in love she definitely won't be writing love songs." [...] In 2015, Madonna said that [...] "True Blue" [...] is [...] "a song about true <b>love.</b> <b>I</b> didn't know what I was talking about when I wrote it." ...|$|E

They end up as full adults. All the things that matter in life, they end up having." [...] Three years before the series finale was created, Mutchnick was asked on his opinion regarding how {{he would like to see}} the character's story come to a conclusion, [...] "The truth is that [...] serve each other's dysfunction.
