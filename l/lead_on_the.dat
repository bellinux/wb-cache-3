5|$|Drainage {{problems}} with the circuit caused {{the first two days}} of the event to be cancelled. Bräck — the season points leader heading into the race — was awarded the pole position. The original distance of the race was reduced from 210 laps to 168. Bräck lost the <b>lead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first lap to de Ferran who held the first position for the next 44 laps. Bräck passed de Ferran to reclaim the <b>lead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 45th lap and remained the leader until the second round of pit stops. The race distance was further reduced by series race director Chris Kneifel from 168 to 140 laps because of a danger from fading daylight. Gil de Ferran held the first position until he was held up by a slower car on the race's penultimate lap which allowed Bräck to retake the lead. He held it until de Ferran overtook him on the final lap winning the race. It was de Ferran's first victory of the season, his second on an oval track, and the sixth of his career. There were three cautions and five lead changes {{during the course of the}} race.|$|E

5|$|Outcome {{is related}} to the extent and {{duration}} of lead exposure. Effects of <b>lead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> physiology of the kidneys and blood are generally reversible; its effects on the central nervous system are not. While peripheral effects in adults often go away when lead exposure ceases, evidence suggests that most of lead's effects on a child's central nervous system are irreversible. Children with lead poisoning may thus have adverse health, cognitive, and behavioral effects that follow them into adulthood.|$|E
