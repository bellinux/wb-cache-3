Our car was lightning fast until that last wreck. When we hit the 16 (Biffle) that knocked the toe-in out. It wasn’t as fast after that. It’s just circumstances but we had a great year. We won the most races (8) and we contended <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> never contended before but circumstances took us out of this one.

500|$|Manchester United manager Ferguson was {{critical}} {{of the performance of}} referee D'Urso: [...] "I felt sorry for the referee today, it doesn't matter how much training you have in any job. It's about temperament, and I just think the lad was too nervous for that today." [...] Despite losing their fourth consecutive Charity Shield match, Ferguson did not believe it would affect his team heading into the start of the season: [...] "We certainly hope we can go on to win the title again <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> in previous years. We just need to keep the standards up and show the desire we did in the second half." [...] He was also unsure whether Liverpool would be able to challenge for the Premier League: [...] "It's difficult to assess Liverpool at the moment. They started with confidence, but then you would expect that from a team that won three trophies a few months ago. You would also expect us to be sluggish at the start, because we are bloody good at it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{negative}} reviews generally {{disliked the}} film's Cold War-period setting, using various adjectives {{to describe it}} such as [...] "stuffy", [...] "stiff", [...] "bor", [...] "oddly hollow", [...] "embalmed", [...] "truncated", and [...] "psychic suffocation". They cited the film's much-advertised reverence of the source material as a fault, referring to the story as [...] "trapped" [...] in a faithful representation of Alan Moore's graphic novel. [...] "Watchmen is a bore [...] It sinks {{under the weight of}} its reverence for the original," [...] wrote Philip Kennicott of The Washington Post. Devin Gordon wrote for Newsweek, [...] "That's the trouble with loyalty. Too little, and you alienate your core fans. Too much, and you lose everyone—and everything—else." [...] Owen Gleiberman's Entertainment Weekly review reads, [...] "Snyder treats each image with the same stuffy hermetic reverence. He doesn't move the camera or let the scenes breathe. He crams the film with bits and pieces, trapping his actors like bugs wriggling in the frame." [...] " [...] never pause to develop a vision of his own. The result is oddly hollow and disjointed; the actors moving stiffly from one overdetermined tableau to another," [...] said Noah Berlatsky of the Chicago Reader. David Edelstein of New York agrees: [...] "They've made the most reverent adaptation of a graphic novel ever. But this kind of reverence kills what it seeks to preserve. The movie is embalmed." [...] A reviewer in The Wall Street Journal wrote, [...] "Watching 'Watchmen' is the spiritual equivalent of being whacked on the skull for 163 minutes. The reverence is inert, the violence noxious, the mythology murky, the tone grandiose, the texture glutinous." [...] Donald Clarke of The Irish Times was similarly dismissive: [...] "Snyder, director of the unsubtle 300, has squinted hard at the source material {{and turned it into a}} colossal animated storyboard, augmented by indifferent performances and moronically obvious music cues." [...] The trade magazines Variety and The Hollywood Reporter were even less taken with the film. Variety's Justin Chang commented that, [...] "The movie is ultimately undone by its own reverence; there's simply no room for these characters and stories to breathe of their own accord, and even the most fastidiously replicated scenes can feel glib and truncated," [...] and Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter writing, [...] "The real disappointment is that the film does not transport an audience to another world, as 300 did. Nor does the third-rate Chandler-esque narration by Rorschach help...Looks <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the first real flop of 2009." ...|$|E

Or the constant message that being sexy means being naked". Keys presented her movement at various events, and received a range of both complimentary and critical responses.|$|E

Shortly after the release, Suede made a short European tour from late November into December covering Spain, France, Belgium, Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany. The band concluded the tour on 7 December at the O2 Arena in London. Suede were subsequently asked whether they would produce any new material and Anderson said, [...] "Unless we were all convinced {{it would be an}} amazing record, I think we'd rather just leave it alone.

[...] To allow the band to create what Holder described as a [...] "really first class album", the band decided to take some time off from touring: [...] "We decided not to rush the album, <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> done on past recording sessions. We wanted to get everything just so. It wasn't just a 'wam bam' job. We had six weeks in the studio to get better and better, so the playing got better, and the sound got better, so yeah in terms of improvement it's a big step ahead.

Also note sometimes there are often slight discrepancies in mileages, for instance NPS and Hahn reports Lock 75 at 175.60 miles, Davies lists [...] "175.35 (175.50)", and Hahn also reports the NPS mile markers are in the wrong place from Milepost 117 to Lock 51, further adding to the confusion.
