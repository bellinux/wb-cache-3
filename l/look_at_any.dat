The Indian batting order {{collapsed}} twice and they didn't <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> point {{that they could have}} made a match out of it. Michael Clarke, playing his first ever Test match, scored 151 runs to take Australia to a commanding position. Harbhajan Singh took another 10 wicket haul (5–146 and 6–78) in the match. Anil Kumble took his 400th wicket. Clarke was awarded Man Of The Match.|$|E
25|$|Bloomberg's successor, Bill de Blasio, {{concurrently}} {{proposed a}} tax on wealthy residents to fund the subway, though a similar tax for universal prekindergarten had previously failed in the state legislature. He also clarified that he opposed Cuomo's plan because his Pre-K tax {{would be more effective}} in raising money. De Blasio's opposition came as some of his supporters in the 2017 mayoral election announced support for the plan, including the Working Families Party and Union Local 32BJ. Later in August 2017, it was clarified that de Blasio did not oppose congestion pricing specifically, and that his office was to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> congestion pricing proposal by Cuomo's administration.|$|E

That’s because of its place in pop culture. It’s always there for someone to pick up, polish off, blow the dust off of it, and re-release it. And Mortal Kombat will always be that way. It’ll be around 50 years from now." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{story had}} no {{traces of the}} Circle 7 version of the film, since the filmmakers did not read its script: [...] "Not out of spite, {{but we wanted to}} start fresh, and not be {{influenced}} by what they'd done," [...] said Unkrich. [...] "We didn't <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> of the work they'd done. We really didn't want to know anything about it." [...] In February 2007, Lasseter announced Toy Story 2s co-director, Unkrich, as the sole director of the film instead of himself (Lasseter had directed the first two films and was busy directing Cars 2), and Michael Arndt as screenwriter. 2010 was also announced as the tentative release date.|$|E

500|$|The video depicts {{an ongoing}} {{conflict}} between gangs, which Ferreira attempts to remedy upon her arrival; she is eventually taken {{in for questioning}} by law enforcement, although she resists her arrest and later escapes from jail. She commented that its concept was inspired by real events, and elaborated that [...] "people always ask me questions about certain things, and it's kind of like my response." [...] Jeremy Gordon from Pitchfork Media interpreted Ferreira's commentary to be referencing her arrest in September 2013, {{in which she was}} charged with possession of ecstasy. Ferreira was criticized on social media networks for allegedly objectifying African American people in the music video, with whom she was seen dancing with during several scenes interspersed throughout the clip. On her Facebook account, Ferreira commented that [...] "I never have and never will <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> human being as a prop" [...] and criticized false assumptions of the [...] "rich little white girl exploiting the black people and the ghetto".|$|E
500|$|Jay-Z {{opened his}} set at Glastonbury 2008 {{with a cover}} of Oasis' song [...] "Wonderwall". When Gallagher {{was asked about the}} {{incident}} he replied, [...] "The way it's played itself out is that I said Jay-Z had no right to play Glastonbury, which is a crock of horseshit. I got off a plane and someone asked me about the fact that Glastonbury hadn't sold {{out for the first time}} in years, and if it was because of Jay-Z. From there it grew into this crap that I was standing on an orange crate at Speakers' Corner saying, 'Gather round, brothers and sisters. Have you heard what's happening at Glastonbury this year?' I have a certain turn of phrase. So if I say, [...] "Chicken sandwiches in McDonald's are just plain fucking wrong," [...] it doesn't mean I'm attacking all chickens or all sandwiches. I've hung out with Jay-Z in Tokyo. I've seen his show. It's not my bag, but it's all right. We have a mutual friend in Chris Martin. So I am a guy who doesn't like hip-hop—shock, horror. I don't dislike rappers or hip-hop or people who like it. I went to the Def Jam tour in Manchester in the '80s when rap was inspirational. Public Enemy were awesome. But it's all about status and bling now, and it doesn't say anything to me." [...] When Jay-Z was asked about Gallagher's comments he said [...] "I haven't spoken to him , I heard he was reaching out. I don't bear any grudge, it's all good. I just believe in good music and bad music, I've always said that. You <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> interview from the beginning of time, I've always stated that I don't believe in the lines and classifications that people put music in so they can easily define it". When asked who he would be interested in collaborating with in the future, the rapper said, [...] "Anyone. Oasis as well – it doesn't matter to me." ...|$|E

2500|$|The globe {{was changed}} {{one last time}} on 5 September 1981 to the double striped BBC1 logo, sitting below a lime green and blue globe on navy blue background. Also, the globe was repainted about this time, which {{resulted}} in South Africa having a pointed tip. The idents were generated by the Nexus Orthicon Display Device (abbreviated to NODD and pronounced [...] "noddy"), which worked by filming an image {{in black and white}} and electronically adding colour before the image was aired. This made it very easy for technical crew to manipulate the colours of the image for whatever reason (like a logo revamp). This technique was also used on the clock and schools idents, which were also filmed in black and white by the same camera and had colour added later on. The camera would be set up looking at a bank of clocks, idents, globes and breakdown captions and could be turned to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> of these idents. The black and blue mirror globe was recreated to introduce Life on Mars which itself is set in the 1970s.|$|E

Of course, it's very {{important to point out that}} some say the Islamic Sharia will cut off people's hands and heads, but it only applies to criminals. And to start off by killing, crucifying etc. That is not correct at all." [...] In response to being asked what the difference between the Islamic Front's and ISIL's version of sharia would be, he said, [...] "One of their mistakes is before the regime has fallen, and before they've established what in Sharia is called Tamkeen , they started applying Sharia, thinking God gave them permission to control the land and establish a Caliphate. This goes against the beliefs of religious scholars around the world. This is what [...] did wrong. This is going to cause a lot of trouble. Anyone who opposes [...] will be considered against Sharia and will be severely punished." ...|$|E
