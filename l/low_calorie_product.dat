According to the non-caloric value of stevia and its beneficial influence on human health, {{there is a great}} possibility of its use in the food industry. Plain yoghurts were produced by fermentation with ABT- 5 cultures (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus and Bifi dobacterium spp.) and flavored by addition of 0. 2 mL/ 100 g strawberry aroma. Yoghurts were sweetened by the addition of 1) sucrose 2) stevia and 3) equal portion of sucrose and stevia in three different concentrations. Sensory properties of yoghurt where evaluated by panel using two methods; ranking test and 20 – point scaling system of weighted factors. Viscosity was measured by viscosimeter. According to sensory panel it was determined that 6 g of stevia was equal to 1000 g of sucrose.

40|$|A simple, {{rapid and}} {{inexpensive}} monoparameter flow-through sensor {{has been developed}} for the determination of saccharin in <b>low</b> <b>calorie</b> and dietary <b>products.</b> The method {{is based on the}} transient adsorption of the sweetener on Sephadex G- 25 solid phase packed to a height of 20 mm in the flow cell. The optimal transient retention of the synthetic sweetener, in terms of sensitivity and sampling frequency, was obtained when pH 2. 75 citric acid-sodium citrate buffer 5 10 3 M was used as a carrier at a flow-rate of 1. 5 ml min 1. Saccharin was determined measuring its intrinsic absorbance at 217 nm at its residence time. Calibration graphs for peak height and peak area were linear over the range 5. 0 – 200. 0 gml 1, RSD 1. 18 %, and 1. 0 – 200. 0 gml 1, RSD 0. 78 %, respectively. Saccharin was determined in several food samples measuring height or area peak, obtaining recoveries ranging between 98 – 104 and 99 – 102 % for height and area peak, respectively. The procedure was validated for use in the determination of saccharin in <b>low</b> <b>calorie</b> and dietary <b>products</b> giving reproducible and accurate results...|$|R

40|$|Valorization of mango peels {{to recover}} pectin has the {{potential}} to increase the economic viability of a biorefinery utilizing this waste resource. Replacement of conventional mineral acids used for extraction of pectin with natural food grade acids would assist in making the process more environmentally friendly and safe for food applications. In this work, we have evaluated the effect of a natural acidifying agent, lemon juice, in combination with sonication, on pectin extraction. Sonication was used for 20 min at 80 degrees C, compared to the conventional process which involves boiling for 150 min, thus improving the energy cost of the process considerably. More than 26 %w/w of the mass of dried mango peel was extracted as pectin; this was classified as low methoxyl pectin (degree of esterification <= 50 %).

For instance, the food {{industry}} advertises high fructose corn syrup as being made from corn without artificial ingredients, having the same calories as sugar and acceptable when used in moderation. Despite its name, high fructose corn syrup is simply a sugar made from corn or an added sugar in the diet. It is not high in fructose as its name would suggest. High fructose corn syrup is composed of the same two simple sugars (fructose and glucose) as table sugar, honey and maple syrup.|$|R

Non-aqueous foams are also composed of gas bubbles, but dispersed in a non-aqueous solvent. In theliterature, articles on such non-aqueous foams are scarce; however, {{the study of}} these foams has recently emerged,especially because of their potential use as <b>low</b> <b>calories</b> food <b>products</b> and of their increasing importance in variousother industries (such as, for instance, the petroleum industry). Non-aqueous foams can be based on three differentfoam stabilizers categories: specialty surfactants, solid particles and crystalline particles. In this review, we onlyfocus on recent advances explaining how solid and crystalline particles {{can lead to the}} formation of non-aqueousfoams, and stabilize them. In fact, as discussed here, the foaming is both driven by the physical properties of theliquid phase and by the interactions between the foam stabilizer and this liquid phase. Therefore, for a given stabilizer,different foaming and stability behavior can be found when the solvent is varied. This is different fromaqueoussystems forwhich the foaming properties are only set by the foam stabilizer. We also highlight how these nonaqueousfoams systems can easily become responsive to temperature changes or by the application of light...|$|R
