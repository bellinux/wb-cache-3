5|$|May 2006 {{was very}} busy for Konnan. In AAA, {{he made his}} first {{appearance}} with La Legión Extranjera (with Chessman & Ron Killings) on May 1, 2006, losing to El Zorro, Octagon & Vampiro Canadiense at AAA Sin <b>Limite.</b> He soon became the leader of the stable, which was active through 2009. That same month, Konnan became the TNA Impact! Spanish color commentator. Additionally, he and the LAX began a storyline that saw them refuse to wrestle (as well as himself and Moody Jack refuse to commentate), claiming that Latinos were discriminated against within TNA.|$|E
25|$|The Brazilian film {{industry}} {{began in the}} late 19th century, during {{the early days of the}} Belle Époque. While there were national film productions during the early 20th century, American films such as Rio the Magnificent were made in Rio de Janeiro to promote tourism in the city. The films <b>Limite</b> (1931) and Ganga Bruta (1933), the latter being produced by Adhemar Gonzaga through the prolific studio Cinédia, were poorly received at release and failed at the box office, but are acclaimed nowadays and placed among the finest Brazilian films of all time. The 1941 unfinished film It's All True was divided in four segments, two of which were filmed in Brazil and directed by Orson Welles; it was originally produced as part of the United States' Good Neighbor Policy during Getúlio Vargas' Estado Novo government.|$|E

500|$|A {{common factor}} {{affecting}} {{the flavors of}} Bordeaux wines is the harvest yields of Cabernet Sauvignon. Throughout Bordeaux there is a legal maximum permitted yield of 50 hectoliters (hl) per hectare (ha). With the aid of global warming and vigorous rootstocks, many Bordeaux vineyards can easily surpass 60 hl/ha, with some estates {{taking advantage of the}} legal loophole of plafond <b>limite</b> de classement ("ceiling limit classification") that permits higher yields during [...] "exceptional" [...] years. This has had an adverse effect on the quality of production from some producers who regularly use grapes harvested at excessive yields. In recent years there has been more of an emphasis on keeping yields low, particularly for an estate's Grand vin.|$|E
500|$|A Skorokhod space, {{also written}} as Skorohod space, is a {{mathematical}} space {{of all the}} functions that are right-continuous with left limits, defined on some interval of the real line such as [...] or , and take values on the real line or on some metric space.

500|$|The {{film was}} first {{released}} on May 29, 1933 in the Alhambra cinema in Rio de Janeiro. It {{was not well}} received on its release; Ganga Bruta was labeled [...] "the worst film of all time" [...] by critics and resulted in [...] "huge financial losses" [...] for Cinédia. Time Out Rio de Janeiro stated that [...] "It was roundly rejected by traditional critics and short-sighted viewers." [...] Opinions were revised after its restoration in 1952 for a screening at the 1st Brazilian Cinema Retrospective, when it [...] "deeply impressed" [...] the directors who {{would be part of}} Cinema Novo movement in the 1960s and 1970s. For example, Glauber Rocha was especially impressed and later cited it as [...] "one of the 20 best films of all time" [...] in his book Revisão Crítica do Cinema Brasileiro. Another film director, Walter Lima, Jr., declared, [...] "there are two films that are such clear archetypes of Brazil's eternal quest, namely <b>Limite</b> and Ganga Bruta. They represent something that you have to polish and something that determines its own space, suggesting {{at the same time that}} something more exists beyond its confines." [...] In 2015 it would be further recognized by the Brazilian Film Critics Association as the 24th best Brazilian film of all time on its Top 100.|$|E

2500|$|Like most French wine regions, {{viticulture}} in the Cote de Nuits is {{dictated by}} tradition and AOC regulations. This {{can be seen}} in the high density planting of 4,000 vines per acre (10,000 vines per ha). This in contrast to other pinot noir producing regions, such as Oregon and the Russian River Valley in Sonoma that rarely have vine density exceed 2,000 vines per acre. Most of the vines are trained under the Guyot system, though there has been some experimentation with the Cordon de Royat system to help temper the vigor of some over productive rootstock. The close plantings and tradition usually mandates manual harvesting of the grapes, especially for the premier and grand cru vineyards. Under AOC regulations, harvest yields for pinot noir are limited to 40 hl/ha (2.3 tons per acre) for premier cru and village level wines and 35 hl/ha for grand cru. However, in what are deemed to be [...] "exceptional years" [...] that warrant larger harvests, growers can seek an exception to the yield maximum with an official plafond <b>limite</b> de classement or PLC from AOC authorities that will allow a 20-30% increase in maximum yields for the year.|$|E
