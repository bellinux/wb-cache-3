40|$|The {{determination}} of the tribilogically optimum composition of chromium-carbide-based solid lubricant coatings using a foil gas bearing test apparatus is described. The coatings contain a wear resistant chromium carbide `base stock' with the lubricant additives silver and BaF 2 -CaF 2 eutectic. The coating composition is optimized for air-lubricated foil gas bearings at temperatures ranging from 25 to 650 C. The various compositions were prepared by powder blending, then plasma sprayed onto Inconel 718 test journals and diamond ground to the desired coating thickness and surface finish. The journals were operated against preoxidized Ni-Cr alloy foils, and the test bearings were subjected to repeated start-stop cycles under a bearing unit of 14 kPa. Sliding contact between the coated journal and the smooth foil occurs during bearing start-up before lift-off or hydrodynamic <b>lubrication</b> <b>by</b> the <b>air</b> film and during bearing coast-down. The bearings were tested for 9000 start-stop cycles or until specimen reached a predetermined failure level...|$|R

40|$|Even though {{studies have}} shown {{unequivocally}} that the coefficient of friction of self-mated silicon nitride can be quite low in water, the basic phenomena responsible for such a low friction is still controversial. In this investigation the effects of load, speed, and surface roughness on {{the duration of the}} run-in period for self-mated silicon nitride in water was studied. Although the results are consistent with proposed mechanisms involving mixed hydrodynamic <b>lubrication</b> <b>by</b> water and boundary <b>lubrication</b> <b>by</b> colloidal silica, an alternate mechanism is suggested. The friction and wear tests were conducted using a pin-on-disk tribometer. The surface roughness of the disks was measured with an atomic force microscope (AFM) scanning several areas 50 x 50 µm in dimensions. For a test on a lapped surface at 5 N and 120 mm/s, the coefficient of friction is seen to decrease from an average of 0. 45 – 0. 01 after 600 min. It is proposed that the low friction could be also related to fundamental interactions between two hard and elastically deforming surfaces covered with hydrogen-terminated oxide films. </span...|$|R

50|$|Engine braking in a premix {{two-stroke}} engine {{can be extremely}} harmful to the engine, because cylinder and piston lubricant is delivered to each cylinder mixed with fuel. Consequently, during engine braking, the engine starves not only of fuel but also lubricant, causing accelerated wear. Many old two-stroke cars (Saab, Wartburg, etc.) had a freewheel device on the transmission to make engine braking optional. Most two-stroke motorcycle engines since the 1970s have had <b>lubrication</b> <b>by</b> an oil pump, independent of the throttle and fuel system, such as Suzuki's Posi-Force system.|$|R

50|$|Bearing life {{is often}} much better when the bearing is kept clean and well lubricated. However, many {{applications}} make good maintenance difficult. For example, bearings in the conveyor {{of a rock}} crusher are exposed continually to hard abrasive particles. Cleaning is of little use, because cleaning is expensive yet the bearing is contaminated again {{as soon as the}} conveyor resumes operation. Thus, a good maintenance program might lubricate the bearings frequently but not include any disassembly for cleaning. The frequent <b>lubrication,</b> <b>by</b> its nature, provides a limited kind of cleaning action, by displacing older (grit-filled) oil or grease with a fresh charge, which itself collects grit before being displaced by the next cycle.|$|R
