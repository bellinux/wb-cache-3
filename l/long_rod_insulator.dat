40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} comparative analysis of optical signals emitted by partial discharges occurring on {{three types of}} high voltage insulators made of porcelain. The research work consisted of diagnosis of the following devices: a <b>long</b> <b>rod</b> <b>insulator,</b> a cap insulator, and an insulating cylinder. For optical signal registration a spectrophotometer was applied. All measurements were performed under laboratory conditions by changing the value of partial discharges generation voltage. For the cylindrical insulator also the distance between {{high voltage and ground}} electrodes was subjected for investigation as a factor having influence on partial discharges. The main contribution which resulted from the studies is statement that application of spectrophotometer enables faster recognition of partial discharges, as compared to standard methods...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} the problems, investigation methods, and solution of using suspension string insulators in Thailand. Corona loss, punctured insulator and easy flashover for contaminated insulators {{are the problems}} that have existed after using these insulators {{for a period of}} time, usually after a few years. These problems incur the reliability degradation of electrical power system. The investigation methods includes; first examination of corona phenomena of the string insulators helps in separating any punctured insulators out of the tested string insulators by observing the corona spots. Second, distributed voltage of the string insulators was checked by using the simple small sphere gaps. Finally, the string insulator characteristics under high humidity were under investigation. We propose the alternating shed <b>long</b> <b>rod</b> <b>insulator</b> prototypes designed and constructed according to IEC to handle the aforementioned problems.

40|$|Sandstorm has {{influence}} on the the electrical properties of outdoor insulator, and {{the analysis of the}} electric field characteristics of insulator under sandstorm condition is very important. The electrostatic field finite element method (FEM) is used to calculate the electric field distribution along <b>long</b> <b>rod</b> <b>insulator</b> under sandstorm condition with FEM software after calculating the one under clean condition. The results of calculation show that the sand deposition decreases the electric field strength of insulator covered with sand, and increases the field strength of the corresponding shed key points. The electric field strength of the non-sand region will increase, when the non-sand region appears in sand layer on insulator. Suspended sand particles in the ambient air can distort the electric field distribution along insulator, and which is significantly affected by the size, the quantity, the charge-to-mass ratio and the charge polarity of sand particles. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Due to the {{decrease}} of industrial contamination emission nearly {{the whole territory}} of Poland belongs to the pollution class light. As a result, the insulators can have now a very short leakage distance. The long-term tests carried out at Glogow test station show that cylindrical insulators without sheds and with a small diameter can have the specific leakage distance of 0, 8 cm/kV which is twice shorter than that recommended by the international standard IEC 60815. This is valid not only for silicone rubber insulators but even for porcelain insulators. To understand this surprisingly good performance, the test results of porcelain cylindrical <b>insulators</b> and standard <b>long</b> <b>rod</b> <b>insulators</b> under artificial rain were presented. The influence of water conductivity, shed parameter and inclination angle from the vertical line was also shown...|$|R
40|$|Pollution test of four <b>long</b> <b>rod</b> <b>insulators</b> with {{different}} shapes {{were carried out}} according to flow on, salt fog and solid layer methods. The following porcelain insulators were investigated: a standard type insulator VKL 75 / 14 with 14 sheds, an insulator with 15 stepped sheds LPZS 75 / 15, an insulator with alternating sheds LPZ 75 / 37 W, and a screw type insulator LPS 75 / 11. During tests the flashover voltage, leakage currents, layer conductivity, salinity of water spray or salt deposit density were measured. The discharge activity and dry band pattern on insulators were observed. The flashover voltage (FOV) of insulator with stepped sheds according to salt fog and solid layer method was higher than the FOV of insulator with alternating sheds in spite that the leakage distance of insulator LPZ 75 / 37 W was longer. On the other hands the FOV of screw insulator was lowest due {{to the formation of}} single dry band at the upper flange...|$|R

40|$|DE 19835883 A UPAB: 20000419 NOVELTY - The {{former is}} placed into the {{evacuated}} plasma reactor chamber. A process gas with unipolar groups is introduced continuously holding the chamber pressure at a predetermined value. Plasma {{is generated by}} an electrical field, maintained until a closed layer of plasma polymer covers the former. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The former is placed into the plasma reactor (1) chamber (2). A process gas with unipolar groups is introduced continuously, holding chamber pressure at 1 x 10 - 5 - 5 x 10 - 1. Plasma is generated by an electrical field, introducing 0. 5 kW/m 3 - 5 kW/m 3 of electrical power. Gas flow is adjusted to 10 sccm/m 3 - 1000 sccm/m 3. Plasma is maintained until a closed layer of plasma polymer covers the former. Preferred features: Power density is 1 kW/m 3 - 3. 5 kW/m 3. Gas flow density is 20 sccm/m 3 - 300 sccm/m 3. Plasma is maintained to produce plasma polymer layer 100 nm - 10 mu m thick. During evacuation, oxidant gas, especially air is introduced, maintaining pressure at 1 - 5 mbar and exciting a cleaning plasma for 1 sec - 5 min. The plasma is excited cyclically at 0. 1 - 100 Hz, using electrodes in the chamber. The field alternates at 1 kHz - 5 GHz. Working pressure is 1 x 10 - 3 - 1 x 10 - 1 mbar. USE - The insulator is for high voltage, especially a <b>long</b> <b>rod</b> <b>insulator</b> (specified in claims). Cited in the text are insulators for microelectronics. Given apparatus and power, size is unimportant. ADVANTAGE - A hydrophobic plasma polymer coating {{is applied to the}} insulator former. Coating is independent of former material. An impressive size range is offered, from electronic micro components, to high voltage insulators, meters long. The coating is hard and durable. It is firmly bonded to the substrate. Unusually high chamber pressure is used, but in combination with the cited conditions, even, durable deposition is achieved. The former material, has little influence on quality of results.

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} length-bidispersity on the {{stability}} of nematic, smectic and columnar phases of rod-like particles is studied in the perfect alignment limit using the Onsager's second virial theory. Three different smectic structures are observed: (i) the conventional smectic (S 1) phase, where both components accommodate in the same layer; (ii) the microsegregated smectic (S 2) phase, which {{can be considered as}} an alternation of fluid layers rich in short and <b>long</b> <b>rods,</b> respectively; and (iii) two layers of short rods accommodate inside one layer of <b>long</b> <b>rods,</b> which gives the third smectic (S 3) structure. With decreasing length ratio () the smectic phase is destabilized with respect to the nematic phase at compositions rich in short rods and two forms of smectic phases, namely S 1 and S 2, take place in alternation. The alternation of the structure is the consequence of the minimization of the number of overlapping layers of the short <b>rods</b> with one <b>long</b> <b>rod.</b> In mixtures rich in <b>long</b> <b>rods,</b> the short and <b>long</b> <b>rods</b> are in the same layer up to l= 0. 39, while the short rods can accommodate into the interstitial region of <b>long</b> <b>rods</b> for l< 0. 39 and the system forms a S 2 phase.

50|$|A <b>long</b> <b>rod</b> is {{superior}} for the figure-eight technique; it allows a bigger and deeper figure-8 pattern to be executed. Short rods naturally create a shorter overall figure-eight pattern. They result in tighter-radius patterns, {{which are often}} difficult for larger muskies to follow. The longer rod increases the entire size of the figure eight, including widening the turns. Collectively, it becomes far easier for a large fish to follow the lure throughout the entire process. The <b>long</b> <b>rod</b> is also superior after the fish hits. Short rods are stiffer and less forgiving. Additional length helps to keep a very even pressure on the fish at all times, so it cannot break the line or shake the hook loose. This even pressure also prevents tearing in the fish’s mouth which results from excessive pressure during battle. The <b>long</b> <b>rod</b> also enables one to keep a thrashing fish down in the water better, leading to greater success.|$|R
