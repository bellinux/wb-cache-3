5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} titanium {{is composed}} of 5 stable isotopes: 46Ti, 47Ti, 48Ti, 49Ti, and 50Ti, with 48Ti being the most abundant (73.8% natural abundance). Eleven radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 44Ti with a half-life of 63 years; 45Ti, 184.8 minutes; 51Ti, 5.76 minutes; and 52Ti, 1.7 minutes. All the other radioactive isotopes have half-lives less than 33 seconds and the majority, <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> second.|$|E
5|$|Aylmer Road is a {{very short}} stretch of road, running west for <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> mile between the {{junction}} with the A1000 in Haringey to the junction with The Bishops Avenue in Barnet. The entire southern {{side of the road}} is taken up by Highgate Golf Course, while the northern side is a mixture of small shops, flats and allotments. The road is named for General Sir Fenton John Aylmer, VC KCB, who received the Victoria Cross for his part in the assault on Nilt Fort on 2 December 1891.|$|E

5|$|On April29, 1963, <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> {{year after}} Karen, Typhoon Olive caused {{extensive}} damage in Guam and the Mariana Islands. With many residents living in tents, and {{debris from the}} storm still scattered about, severe damage was anticipated. Schools, churches, and other structures were opened as shelters {{in order to protect}} those without homes. Ultimately, Guam was spared the worst of the storm though much of Saipan was devastated. The island was again devastated in 1976 by Typhoon Pamela which buffeted the island with destructive winds for 36hours. Though weaker than Karen, the longer lasting impact of Pamela was regarded as more destructive.|$|E

He {{played two}} {{games with the}} Wheat Kings during the 2010-11 season before joining Team Canada at the 2011 World Junior Championships. After the tournament was complete, Schenn was dealt to his hometown Saskatoon Blades for a package of draft picks and prospects. He played in 27 games with the Blades, scoring 21 goals and adding 32 assists.

5|$|Anthozoans are {{exclusively}} marine, {{and include}} sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals, sea pens, sea fans and sea pansies. Anthozoa {{is the largest}} taxon of cnidarians; over six thousand solitary and colonial species have been described. They {{range in size from}} small individuals <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> centimetre across to large colonies a metre or more in diameter. They include species {{with a wide range of}} colours and forms that build and enhance reef systems. Although reefs and shallow water environments exhibit a great array of species, there are in fact more species of coral living in deep water than in shallow, and many taxa have shifted during their evolutionary history from shallow to deep water and vice versa.|$|E

5|$|East Stirlingshire's {{traditional}} rival is Falkirk. The club's first match {{known as}} both Britannia and East Stirlingshire were friendly games against Falkirk in 1880 and 1881. Both clubs {{are based in}} Falkirk and have competed {{against each other in}} competitions such as Stirlingshire Cup since the late 19th century. East Stirlingshire was elected to the bottom tier of the Scottish Football League in 1900, closely followed by Falkirk two seasons later in 1902–03. The first competitive league meeting between the clubs ended in a 2–0 win for Falkirk at Merchiston Park in August 1902. The two clubs' old grounds of Firs Park and Brockville Park were geographically close, separated by <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> mile (0.8km).|$|E
5|$|Herm is only 1½miles long (north-south) and <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> mile wide (east-west). In the {{northern}} part of the island are two hills, Le Petit Monceau and Le Grande Monceau. To the north of these is a common, leading to Mouisonniere Beach on {{the northern}} coast, with Oyster Point in the northwestern corner and La Pointe du Gentilhomme or Alderney Point at the northeastern corner. To the east of the common is Shell Beach and to the west is The Bear's Beach, leading down to the harbour. Half of the coastline of {{the northern part}} of the island is surrounded by sandy beaches; the southern half is rocky. Much of Herm's bedrock is granite. In 2008, Adrian Heyworth, who was at the time the island's tenant, said that two or three metres of sand were being lost annually at Alderney Point.|$|E
5|$|Individual archaea {{range from}} 0.1micrometers (μm) to over 15μm in diameter, and occur in various shapes, {{commonly}} as spheres, rods, spirals or plates. Other morphologies in the Crenarchaeota include irregularly shaped lobed cells in Sulfolobus, needle-like filaments that are <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> micrometer in diameter in Thermofilum, and almost perfectly rectangular rods in Thermoproteus and Pyrobaculum. Archaea in the genus Haloquadratum such as Haloquadratum walsbyi are flat, square archaea {{that live in}} hypersaline pools. These unusual shapes are probably maintained both by their cell walls and a prokaryotic cytoskeleton. Proteins related to the cytoskeleton components of other organisms exist in archaea, and filaments form within their cells, but in contrast to other organisms, these cellular structures are poorly understood. In Thermoplasma and Ferroplasma {{the lack of a}} cell wall means that the cells have irregular shapes, and can resemble amoebae.|$|E

5|$|Bypass US Highway131 (Byp. US131) was a {{bypass route}} around {{downtown}} Grand Rapids. The highway followed 28th Street eastward from the intersection with US131 (Division Street) south of downtown. From this starting point eastward, it ran concurrently with Byp. US16 and Byp M-21. M-37 also followed 28th Street {{at the time}} eastward from the intersection at Kalamazoo Avenue. At the intersection with East Beltline and Broadmoor avenues in Paris Township (now Kentwood), Byp.US16/Byp. US131/Byp.M-21 turned northward to follow East Beltline, and M-37 turned southward on Broadmoor. The bypass route continued northward through Grand Rapids Township. At the intersection with US16/M-50 (Cascade Road), Byp. US16 ended, and Byp. M-21 ended <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> mile (0.4km) north of that at the intersection with M-21 (Fulton Street). North of the intersection with Fulton Street, Byp. US131 was the only designation along East Beltline Avenue at the time. The highway ran northward into Plainfield Township, and it terminated at an intersection with US131 at Plainfield Avenue and Northland Drive {{just south of the}} Grand River.|$|E
5|$|SR15 {{ends at the}} Michigan {{state line}} just north of Pioneer, Ohio, where it becomes M-99. The roadway travels northward from the state line on Pioneer Road, through mostly {{agricultural}} areas of Hillsdale County before reaching a junction with M-34 just west of Osseo. The trunkline turns westward on Hudson Road, which curves to the north around Baw Beese Lake just southeast of Hillsdale. M-99 passes through Hillsdale on a northwest course on Broad Street and Carlton Road, passing {{just a few blocks}} to the west of Hillsdale College. After leaving town, the road bends to the north as Olds Street as it runs parallel to the St. Joseph River to Jonesville. In that community, M-99 intersects US12. The two highways run concurrently through Jonesville for <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> mile (0.8km) before M-99 returns to its northwesterly course. It leaves the town toward Litchfield continuing parallel to the river.|$|E
5|$|Business US Highway127 (Bus. US127) is a {{business}} loop through Alma. The highway starts at a partial interchange for exit123 on US127 {{in a rural area}} east of Alma. There are a few businesses adjacent to the interchange and an intersection with State Road, which provides access to another partial interchange with US127 as well as the Bus. US127 for St. Louis. Continuing westward along Lincoln Road, the landscape along the southern leg of Bus. US127 comprises farm land. Once the highway enters Alma, the street name changes to Superior Street. Bus. US127 crosses the Pine River and runs through residential neighborhoods on the eastern side of Alma before entering the downtown area. At an intersection with Wright Avenue to the east of the campus of Alma College, Bus. US127 turns northward. North of downtown, the business loop crosses another residential area before passed the hospital and more commercial properties. In Pine River Township north of the city, Bus. US127 intersects M-46 (Monroe Road). M-46 connects the Alm{{a business}} loop to the St. Louis business loop and a partial interchange with US127, while the Alma business loop continues <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> mile (0.6km) to the partial interchange with US127 that serves as the business loop's northern terminus.|$|E

5|$|Eclipses only {{occur in}} the eclipse season, when the Sun is close to either the {{ascending}} or descending node of the Moon. Each eclipse is separated by one, five or six lunations (synodic months), and the midpoint of each season is separated by 173.3 days, which is the mean time for the Sun to travel from one node to the next. The period is a little <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> calendar year because the lunar nodes slowly regress. Because 223 synodic months is roughly equal to 239 anomalistic months and 242 draconic months, eclipses with similar geometry recur 223 synodic months (about 6,585.3 days) apart. This period (18 years 11.3 days) is a saros. Because 223 synodic months is not identical to 239 anomalistic months or 242 draconic months, saros cycles do not endlessly repeat. Each cycle begins with the Moon's shadow crossing the earth near the north or south pole, and subsequent events progress toward the other pole until the Moon's shadow misses {{the earth and the}} series ends. Saros cycles are numbered; currently, cycles 117 to 156 are active. The next solar eclipse will occur on February 15, 2018. It will be a partial solar eclipse visible from Antarctica and south South America.|$|E
5|$|With <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> quarter {{remaining}} {{and down}} by three scores, Virginia Tech had a nearly insurmountable deficit to overcome. The Hokies fielded the kickoff for a touchback, and the Tech offense began at its 20-yard line. On the Hokies' {{first and second}} plays of the drive, Vick was sacked for losses. The third play was an incomplete pass, and the Hokies were forced to punt. After fielding the kick at their 38-yard line, Florida State began running out the clock by running the ball. After failing to gain a first down on two consecutive rushes and an incomplete pass, Florida State punted. The ball rolled into the end zone, and Tech's offense began again at its 20-yard line. Vick threw for short yardage, then Kendrick ran for a first down at the Tech 37-yard line. Vick completed a 23-yard first down pass to Emmet Johnson, and the Hokies entered Florida State territory with the clock ticking steadily down. On the first play in Seminoles' territory, Vick completed another 23-yard pass, this time to Davis, who picked up a first down at the Florida State 23-yard line. Thanks to a holding penalty against the Seminoles, Tech was granted a first down at the State eight-yard line. Vick threw an incomplete pass, ran for three yards, and then threw another pass to a player who was stopped short of the goal line. Facing fourth down and needing just two yards for a touchdown, Tech attempted to pass for the touchdown, but Vick was sacked and turned the ball over on downs with 1:12 remaining. With almost no time remaining, Florida State continued running down the clock and earned the 4629 victory.|$|E
