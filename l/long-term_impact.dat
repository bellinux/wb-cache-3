His legal innovations form part of the basis for English law, with the Exchequer of Pleas a forerunner of the Common Bench at Westminster. Henry's itinerant justices also influenced his contemporaries' legal reforms: Philip Augustus' creation of itinerant bailli, for example, drew on Henry's model.

5|$|A {{study by}} {{astronomer}} Steven J. Dick at the United States Naval Observatory considered the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact by analyzing events of similar {{significance in the}} history of science. The study argues that the impact would be most strongly influenced by the information content of the message received, if any. It distinguishes short-term and <b>long-term</b> <b>impact.</b> Seeing radio-based contact as a more plausible scenario than a visit from extraterrestrial spacecraft, the study rejects the commonly stated analogy of European colonization of the Americas as an accurate model for information-only contact, preferring events of profound scientific significance, such as the Copernican and Darwinian revolutions, as more predictive of how humanity might be impacted by extraterrestrial contact.|$|E

However, resistance to antibiotics may develop as a result of antibiotic therapy. Several types of birth control pills help against acne in women. Isotretinoin pills are usually reserved for severe acne due to greater potential side effects.

5|$|By gaining {{power through}} {{a vote of}} {{confidence}} from the people and then willingly surrendering power, Selvo, like many other Doges who underwent similar transitions, left a <b>long-term</b> <b>impact</b> on the succession process that would eventually become a model for peaceful, anti-nepotistic transitions of power in a classical republic. Although his deposition did not immediately change the system, it was one of many important changes of power in a society that {{was in the process of}} moving away from a monarchy and toward a government led by an elected official. Following the battles at Corfu, Selvo was seen by many as inept and incapable of handling the duties that a Doge must perform. His apparent squandering of nearly the entire fleet coupled with a decade-long distrust for his royal wife caused Selvo to become unpopular in Venice. By responding to the will of the people, Selvo helped shape a society that would eventually create a complicated system to check the power of its most influential members, create cooperative governmental branches that checked each other's power, and fuse the nation into a classical republic.|$|E
5|$|In October 2000, Dr John Ryan, an Accident & Emergency {{consultant}} at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton criticised {{the number of}} patients visiting the department for minor ailments without first contacting their GP. Ryan attributed this phenomenon to patients viewing Holby City and American medical drama ER, and falsely perceiving hospitals as glamorous. A three-year Belgian research project, presented at a British Psychological Society meeting in September 2008, claimed that watching Holby City and similar medical dramas such as Casualty and ER had a subliminal influence on fear of illness. 1,300 teenagers were questioned on their viewing habits, and those who watched more medical dramas were found to be up to 10% more fearful about their health, with females more affected than males. Dr Jan Van Mierlo of Hasselt University stated that further research was needed into the <b>long-term</b> <b>impact</b> of television.|$|E

40|$|This paper assesses <b>long-term</b> <b>impacts</b> {{of early}} {{adoption}} of vegetable and polyculture fish production technologies on household and individual well-being in Bangladesh. In 1996 - 1997 and 2006 - 2007, {{a panel of}} households were surveyed in three sites where non-governmental organisations and extension programmes disseminated agricultural technologies. Using nearest-neighbour matching to construct a statistical comparison group, the authors find that <b>long-term</b> <b>impacts</b> differ across agricultural technology interventions and across outcomes. <b>Long-term</b> <b>impacts</b> on household-level consumption expenditures and asset accumulation are, in general, insignificant in the improved vegetables sites, but are positive and significant in the individually operated fish ponds sites. However, the impacts on individual nutrient intake, nutrient adequacy, and nutritional status do not follow the pattern of household-level <b>impacts.</b> Differences in <b>long-term</b> and short-term <b>impacts</b> arise from several causes: differences in dissemination and targeting mechanisms that may affect household-level adoption decisions; initial differences between comparison and treatment groups; divisibility and ease of dissemination of the technology; and intrahousehold allocation processes that determine the allocation of gains from the new technology among household members. adoption, agriculture, Bangladesh, impact assessment,...|$|R
5|$|The {{introduction}} of deer to New Zealand {{began in the}} middle of the 19th century, and current populations are primarily European red deer, with only 15 percent being elk. There is significant hybridization of elk with the more numerous red deer to the extent that pure elk may no longer exist in the wild in New Zealand. These deer have had an adverse impact on forest regeneration of some plant species, as they consume more palatable species which are replaced with those that are less favored by the elk. The <b>long-term</b> <b>impact</b> will be an alteration of the types of plants and trees found, and in other animal and plant species dependent upon them. As in Chile and Argentina, the IUCN has declared that red deer and elk populations in New Zealand are an invasive species.|$|E

40|$|The report {{critically}} {{review the}} literature on the <b>long-term</b> <b>impacts</b> of Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programs in Latin America. We define <b>long-term</b> <b>impacts</b> as those that both: 1) are related to the accumulation of human capital, and; 2) are observed after beneficiary children have reached a later stage of the life-cycle. We focus on two transitions. The first is that of children exposed to CCTs in utero or early childhood (under age 6), who have then transitioned to school ages. The second is that of children exposed to CCTs during school-age, who have then transitioned to early adulthood. Evidence is largely mixed. The experimental literature finds consistent positive effects on schooling, as well as some positive impacts on cognitive skills and learning, socioemotional skills and off-farm employment and income. However, many other estimates are not statistically different from zero and it is often not possible to discern whether this is due to lack of impact or to methodological shortcomings. Nonexperimental evidence also is mixed. Developing further opportunities for research with a clean identification strategy for the measurement of <b>long-term</b> <b>impacts</b> should be high on the agenda. As original beneficiaries continue to age, this should also be increasingly possible...|$|R

40|$|Research on the {{economic}} and human toll of natural disasters focuses on the short‐term, often ignoring the important <b>long‐term</b> <b>impacts</b> of these catastrophic events. The main reason {{for the lack of}} empirical research on the long‐term is the inherent and unavoidable difficulty in identifying any <b>long‐term</b> <b>impacts</b> and attributing them to the disaster. On the 23 rd of May 1960, a devastating tsunami struck the city of Hilo on the island of Hawaii. Remarkably, there was no significant injury or damage elsewhere in the Hawaiian Islands. This tsunami provides a unique natural experiment as the tsunami was unexpected, and the other Hawaiian Islands, which were not hit by the tsunami, provide an ideal control group that enables us to precisely identify the counter‐factual. We use a newly developed synthetic control methodology formalized in Abadie et al. (2010) to measure the <b>long‐term</b> <b>impacts</b> of the tsunami.
