5|$|The site of One Meridian Plaza {{was bought}} by the Arden Group in 2000. The site was {{converted}} into a parking <b>lot</b> <b>as</b> construction on a new building was held up in a zoning feud with the neighboring site, 1441 Chestnut Street. 1441 Chestnut Street {{was the site of}} the Morris Building and other smaller buildings that sat behind One Meridian Plaza. The feud between Arden Group's chief executive Craig Spencer and 1441 Chestnut Street developer Tim Mahoney began in 2003. Spencer and Mahoney settled their dispute in March 2006 and construction on One Meridian's 48-story replacement, the Residences at the Ritz-Carlton began in May. The Residences at The Ritz-Carlton opened in January 2009. A memorial was unveiled on October 21, 2009 at the skyscraper honoring the three firefighters who died in the fire. The memorial features three bronze firefighter helmets atop a marble base with the firefighters' names on it. It sits in an empty area between the condo building and the adjacent hotel along the south side of South Penn Square across from the SW corner of Dilworth Park.|$|E

The following week on Raw, Lesnar would brawl with Reigns {{until they were}} both attacked by The Wyatt Family. At the Royal Rumble on January 24, Lesnar was the 23rd entrant, eliminating four competitors before being eliminated by Bray Wyatt {{with help from the}} rest of The Wyatt Family. On the January 25 episode of Raw, Stephanie McMahon announced that the main event of Fastlane would be a triple threat match between Lesnar, Roman Reigns and Dean Ambrose to determine who would face Triple H for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 32. In the following weeks, Lesnar would be continuously provoked by Ambrose, with Reigns saving him from the subsequent attacks by Lesnar. At Fastlane on February 21, Lesnar dominated most of the match before he was put through two broadcast tables by Ambrose and Reigns; he would ultimately lose the match after Reigns pinned Ambrose. Because of this, Lesnar attacked Ambrose in the parking <b>lot</b> <b>as</b> he was arriving at the arena. Ambrose returnef later in the night, having hijacked an ambulance, and challenged Lesnar to a No Holds Barred Street Fight match at WrestleMania 32 on April 3, where Lesnar defeated Ambrose after an F-5 onto a pile of chairs.|$|E

Clarkâ€™s father didnâ€™t get a lot of schooling because his father worked a <b>lot</b> <b>as</b> a child, so he didnâ€™t learn how to read and was eventually taught by his wife. At the age of three or four, Hull and his family moved to a farm in Michigan. Here, he and his younger brother, Wayne, helped the farm by performing manual labor and chores around the house.|$|E

When they caught up with them at Dan, Abram devised a battle plan by splitting his group into more than one unit, and launched a night raid. Not only were they able to free the captives, Abram's unit chased and slaughtered the Elamite King Chedorlaomer at Hobah, just north of Damascus. They freed <b>Lot,</b> <b>as</b> well as his household and possessions, and recovered all of the goods from Sodom that had been taken.|$|E

He became popular on campus as a result. Shortly after school he joined (now P-Square's official choreographer), Nonso Asobe's (a.k.a. Don Flexxx) dance group Ignite and performed in many events. Then in 2006 he featured on popular African act, D'banj's smashing hit, Why Me video as a dancer and on DJ Zeez's, Same Ni video. His dancing career was steady-rising towards peak when busy radio schedules among other activities choked out the time he made out for professional dancing.|$|E

He was warned that the Chinese Navy did not have the budget to buy the ship, and the Chinese government did not support the purchase. However, Xu was so impressed when touring the ship that he resolved to purchase it using his personal funds. The previous year, Xu had borrowed HK$230 million from a Hong Kong business friend, spending HK$6 million to create Chong <b>Lot</b> <b>as</b> a Macau shell corporation. He described a harrowing negotiation in Kiev, lubricated by bribery and liquor, which helped to arrange victory at the auction.

25|$|Good fortune came to {{the rescue}} when Casanova, unhappy with his <b>lot</b> <b>as</b> a musician, saved the life of a Venetian nobleman of the Bragadin family, who had a stroke while riding with Casanova in a gondola after a wedding ball. They {{immediately}} stopped to have the senator bled. Then, at the senator's palace, a physician bled the senator again and applied an ointment of mercury to the senator's chest (mercury was an all-purpose but toxic remedy of the time). The mercury raised his temperature and induced a massive fever, and Bragadin appeared to be choking on his own swollen windpipe. A priest was called as death seemed to be approaching. However, despite protests from the attending physician, Casanova ordered the removal of the ointment and the washing of the senator's chest with cool water. The senator recovered from his illness with rest and a sensible diet. Because of his youth and his facile recitation of medical knowledge, the senator and his two bachelor friends thought Casanova wise beyond his years, and concluded that he must be in possession of occult knowledge. As they were cabalists themselves, the senator invited Casanova into his household and became a lifelong patron.|$|E
25|$|As Phoenix sprawled north, {{developers}} found {{plenty of}} available land on Central Avenue and began {{capitalizing on the}} cachet of the youthful city's signature boulevard. Local steakhouse legend Durant's (2611 N) opened in 1950 and has changed little other than that patrons today enter the restaurant through the back off the parking <b>lot</b> <b>as</b> celebrities and other socialites once did back then. Park Central Mall (3110 N) replaced a dairy farm in the middle part of the decade, signaling the beginning of downtown's long decline as retail stores and malls opened {{away from the city}} center. America's second McDonald's restaurant was built near Indian School Road in 1953. It was the first McDonald's franchise, the first to feature the Golden Arches, and served as a model for Ray Kroc's Illinois store. These early commercial developments foreshadowed the trend towards autocentrism on Central Avenue and indeed the rest of the city. The first major high-rise built on Central Avenue outside of downtown was the Phoenix Towers (2201 N), erected in 1957. The Phoenix Art Museum moved to Central Avenue in 1959. Phoenix fully annexed Sunnyslope, at Central's north terminus, that year. Central Avenue to its southern terminus, South Mountain, where minorities had been historically redlined, was annexed a year later.|$|E
