50|$|In geometry, the cissoid of Diocles is a cubic plane curve {{notable for}} the {{property}} {{that it can be}} used to construct two mean proportionals to a given ratio. In particular, {{it can be used to}} double a cube. It can be defined as the cissoid of a circle and a line tangent to it with respect to the point on the circle opposite to the point of tangency. In fact, the family of cissoids is named for this example and some authors refer to it simply as the cissoid. It has a single cusp at the pole, and is symmetric about the diameter of the circle which is the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>tangency</b> of the cusp. The line is an asymptote. It is a member of the conchoid of de Sluze family of curves and in form it resembles a tractrix.|$|E
40|$|The {{flow field}} in {{supersonic}} mixed compression aircraft inlets at {{angle of attack}} is calculated. A zonal modeling technique is employed to obtain the solution which divides the flow field into different computational regions. The computational regions consist of a supersonic core flow, boundary layer flows adjacent to both the forebody/centerbody and cowl contours, and flow in the shock wave boundary layer interaction regions. The zonal modeling analysis is described and some computational results are presented. The governing equations for the supersonic core flow form a hyperbolic system of partial differential equations. The equations for the characteristic surfaces and the compatibility equations applicable along these surfaces are derived. The characteristic surfaces are the stream surfaces, which are surfaces composed of streamlines, and the wave surfaces, which are surfaces tangent to a Mach conoid. The compatibility equations are expressed as directional derivatives along streamlines and bicharacteristics, which are the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>tangency</b> between a wave surface and a Mach conoid...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to the study of cyclides osculating general surfaces. We show that generically, at any point of a surface, one has a one-parameter family of cyclides tangent to a surface curve of order three and among them just one is tangent to this curve of order four. This one will be called the osculating cyclide here. Directions <b>of</b> this <b>tangency</b> <b>of</b> higher order form a line filed on the surface and its {{integral}} curves will be called Dupin lines on the surface under consideration. Our Dupin lines are analogous to classical <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> curvature corresponding in the same to the eigenvectors of the Weingarten (shape) operator of a surface, that is to the directions <b>of</b> <b>tangency</b> <b>of</b> order two of its osculating spheres. Each point of a generic surface meets two orthogonal <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> curvature but only one Dupin line. Our main result shows that a large class of foliations of open planar domains can be realized as Dupin foliations, that is foliations by Dupin lines, on several surfaces.

50|$|LLL {{problems}} generally offer 4 solutions. As shown above, if {{a circle}} is tangent to two given lines, its center must lie on one <b>of</b> the two <b>lines</b> that bisect the angle {{between the two}} given lines. Therefore, if a circle is tangent to three given lines L1, L2, and L3, its center C must be located at the intersection <b>of</b> the bisecting <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> the three given lines. In general, there are four such points, giving four different solutions for the LLL Apollonius problem. The radius of each solution is determined by finding a point <b>of</b> <b>tangency</b> T, which may be done by choosing {{one of the three}} intersection points P between the given lines; and drawing a circle centered on the midpoint of C and P of diameter equal to the distance between C and P.

Although the basic theory behind it is known [5], the novelty of the method lies in the efficient and robust way <b>of</b> solving the <b>tangency</b> problem and its successful application to a real-life problem: namely, the modelling of fruit on rollers for fruit grading.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{singularities}} of the isotropic {{skeleton of a}} Weinstein manifold in relation to Nadler's program of arboreal singularities. By deforming the skeleton via homotopies of the Weinstein structure, we produce a Morse-Bott* representative of the Weinstein homotopy class whose stratified skeleton determines its symplectic neighborhood. We then study the singularities of the skeleta in this class and show that after {{a certain type of}} generic perturbation either (1) these singularities fall into the class of (signed Lagrangian versions of) Nadler's arboreal singularities which are combinatorially classified into finitely many types in a given dimension or (2) there are singularities <b>of</b> <b>tangency</b> in associated front projections. We then turn to the singularities <b>of</b> <b>tangency</b> to try to reduce them also to collections of arboreal singularities. We give a general localization procedure to isolate the Liouville flow to a neighborhood of these non-arboreal singularities, and then show how to replace the simplest singularities <b>of</b> <b>tangency</b> (those <b>of</b> type Σ^ 1, 0) by arboreal singularities.
