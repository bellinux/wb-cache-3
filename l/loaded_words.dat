25|$|MIPS III is a backwards-compatible {{extension}} of MIPS II that added support for 64-bit memory addressing and integer operations. The 64-bit data type {{is called a}} doubleword, and MIPS III extended the general-purpose registers, HI/LO registers, and program counter to 64 bits to support it. New instructions were added to load and store doublewords, to perform integer addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and shift operations on them, and to move doubleword between the GPRs and HI/LO registers. Existing instructions originally defined to operate of 32-bit words were redefined, where necessary, to sign-extend the 32-bit results to permit words and doublewords to be treated identically by most instructions. Among those instructions redefined was <b>Load</b> <b>Word.</b> In MIPS III it sign-extends words to 64 bits. To complement <b>Load</b> <b>Word,</b> a version that zero-extends was added.|$|R

It has proved popular among linguists in Continental Europe, but is not so well known in English-speaking countries, especially among people who are not trained linguists. Although only one of many possible paradigms, it has the advantage of being constructed by trained linguists for the particular purpose of analyzing and categorizing varieties of speech, and has the additional merit of replacing such <b>loaded</b> <b>words</b> as [...] "language" [...] and [...] "dialect" [...] with the German terms of ausbau language and abstand language, words that are not (yet) loaded with political, cultural, or emotional connotations.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the neural correlates of working memory maintenance for real objects in contrast to their verbal designations. For this purpose we employed a delayed match-to-sample task using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The conjunction of load effects for objects and for words revealed a common bilateral network with main foci in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the intraparietal sulcus. Load effect for objects in comparison to <b>load</b> effect for <b>words</b> revealed stronger activation of bilateral precuneus, which suggests the use of mental imagery of objects and object features. The opposite comparison <b>load</b> <b>words</b> versus <b>load</b> objects showed premotor and auditory areas to be activated in association with phonological rehearsal. The bilateral common activation indicates overlapping codes for real-world objects and their verbal designations. Importantly, {{there is also a}} dissociation between maintenance of words and objects, which indicates that phonological rehearsal and mental imagery are employed to different degrees.

Corpus linguistics provides an excellent framework to discover such discourse patterns and the critical discourse analysis framework helps contextualise the findings. The specific aim of the paper is to discover and compare the discourse patterns surrounding the specific nominals rapist* and paedophile* {{in order to see}} how the representations differ. The analysis uncovered that the representation of both offenders was sensationalised and full of negative and emotionally <b>loaded</b> <b>words.</b> Furthermore, it was discovered that two differing discourses were prominent for each nominal: An animalistic and bodily discourse for rapist* and a discourse of deviance and the mind for peadophile*. Lastly, it is argued that these misrepresentations are problematic as they misinform both the public and the regulation of offenders...|$|E

The participants were 74 senior high school and 21 undergraduate college students. Participants were asked to read a short story, some words were in bold type, and thereafter for their subjective perception of the words in bold type loading and memory of them in a recognition list. Attributional style was operationalized with an own constructed instrument. The results show that happy individuals interpreted more words as positive than negative in comparission with unhappy individuals. No correlation between participants well-being and global or attributional style for negative events were found. Both groups showed a tendency to be more optimistic than pessimstic for positive events. No differences were found for either memory or priming of <b>loaded</b> <b>words.</b> In sum the results suggest that happy individuals tend to conceive the world more positive...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose for}} this essay {{was to find}} out what {{differences}} there are between the adjectives generous and greedy regarding usage frequency and in what contexts they are used. My research for this paper is based on a computer search program called MP 2. 2 which was applied to the A files of the British National Corpus. After analysing and comparing the two adjectives, the following conclusion was drawn: Generous was five times as often used compared to greedy, and a possibility why this is so may be that people prefer to use more positively <b>loaded</b> <b>words.</b> The fact that generous had a better result than greedy, may be a reason why this adjective was used in so many more metaphorical expressions than greedy, because if people often use a word, sooner or later they will come up with new areas of usage. In the metaphorical expressions generous often signified quantity, whereas greedy was extended to the meaning of “taking something more figuratively”. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|Social Media offer a {{vast amount}} of geo-located and time-stamped textual content {{directly}} generated by people. This information can be analysed to obtain insights about the general state of a large population of users and to address scientific questions from a diversity of disciplines. In this work, we estimate temporal patterns of mood variation through the use of emotionally <b>loaded</b> <b>words</b> contained in Twitter messages, possibly reflecting underlying circadian and seasonal rhythms in the mood of the users. We present a method for computing mood scores from text using affective word taxonomies, and apply it to millions of tweets collected in the United Kingdom during the seasons of summer and winter. Our analysis results in the detection of strong and statistically significant circadian patterns for all the investigated mood types. Seasonal variation does not seem to register any important divergence in the signals, but a periodic oscillation within a 24 -hour period is identified for each mood type. The main common characteristic for all emotions is their mid-morning peak, however their mood score patterns differ in the evenings...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{introduces}} “Emotional Verbal Fluency” as a novel (partially computerized) task, which is aimed {{to investigate the}} interaction between emotionally <b>loaded</b> <b>words</b> and executive functions. Verbal fluency tasks are thought to measure executive functions but the interaction with emotional aspects is hardly investigated. In the current study, a group of healthy subjects (n = 21, mean age 25 years, 76 % females) were asked to generate items that are either part of a semantic category (e. g., plants, toys, vehicles; standard semantic verbal fluency) or can trigger the emotions joy, anger, sadness, fear and disgust. The results of the task revealed no differences between performance on semantic and emotional categories, suggesting a comparable task difficulty for healthy subjects. Hence, these first results on the comparison between semantic and emotional verbal fluency seem to highlight that both might be suitable for examining executive functioning. However, an interaction {{was found between the}} category type and repetition (first vs. second sequence of the same category) with larger performance decrease for semantic in comparison to emotional categories. Best performance overall was found for the emotional category “joy” suggesting a positivity bias in healthy subjects. To conclude, emotional verbal fluency is a promising approach to investigate emotional components in an executive task, which may stimulate further research, especially in psychiatric patients who suffer from emotional as well as cognitive deficits...|$|E
