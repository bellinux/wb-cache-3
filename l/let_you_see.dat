500|$|Omitted {{from the}} {{remainder}} of the series, Kippax became the first of several Australian batting [...] "casualties" [...] during the summer. While most sympathised with his misfortune, and attributed his lack of confidence to the blows he received the previous season, Larwood was more succinct: [...] "Kippax was scared stiff and he <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> it". Employed as a radio commentator, Kippax spent {{the remainder of}} the series covering the Tests, and he also delivered a ten-minute round up of each day’s play for the BBC, broadcast in England through its Empire short wave service.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were as positive. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B–" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "alternately deeply moving and really, really stupid". His main {{criticism}} of the episode was the it portrayed mental illness {{in a manner that}} was [...] "offensive at worst and just plain idiotic at best". Furthermore, he derided the [...] "magical mentally handicapped person" [...] trope as [...] "cringe-worthy" [...] and cliche. VanDerWerff, however, wrote that the episode was saved largely due to the [...] "beautiful little scenes that <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> the weight of everything Scully's been carrying around her".|$|E

500|$|Mary's Club {{has been}} called a [...] "downtown institution" [...] and a [...] "Portland nightlife landmark". In 2001, The Portland Mercury called the club [...] "a must-visit for any true strip club connoisseur" [...] for {{offering}} [...] "friendliness and sexiness". A reporter found the interior [...] "cozy", with conversational dancers who seemed to enjoy their interaction with guests. After Keller's death, Willamette Week said that the club [...] "has cemented its place in history far beyond the city limits" [...] for featuring Love and Jorgensen and offering nudity to a loyal customer base. The newspaper's Mary Christmas wrote that Keller had become a [...] "regional celebrity" [...] and could be credited with beginning a local industry. In 2011, a contributor to the Daily Vanguard (Portland State University's student newspaper) included Mary's on his list of the city's top five strip clubs: [...] "If you visit only one dance club in this town it should probably be Mary’s. The inside is stuffy and sleazy, but embodies that red-light district feel that fits right in with [...] rowdy environment." [...] That year, Willamette Week called the club [...] "the undisputed grande dame of West Coast strips" [...] and [...] "a stubbornly degenerate landmark". According to the newspaper's Matthew Korfhage, its entertainment {{came in the form of}} [...] "girls/ladies, friendly also brassy, oddly classy, with sterling taste on the juke, who <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> all of their piercings and tattoos. Also, video poker". In 2013, Portland Monthly made Mary's Club an [...] "editor's pick" [...] for its dancers, its all-female staff, and its [...] "welcoming and relaxed" [...] environment. Thrillist.com included Mary's in its [...] "definitive guide" [...] to Portland's best strip clubs, complimenting its [...] "glorious flashing sign that welcomes you to Downtown" [...] and calling the club [...] "a part of Portland's past we should all cherish". Men's Fitness included Mary's on its list of the [...] "Top 10 Best Strip Clubs in America", calling it a [...] "neon landmark" [...] with blacklight murals and a [...] "relaxed, hole-in-the-wall vibe".|$|E
