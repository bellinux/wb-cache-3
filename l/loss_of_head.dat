60|$|I {{suppose the}} unwonted speed must have {{intoxicated}} us. There {{is nothing else}} that will account for our <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>head.</b> For, before we were well out of the machine, we had begun negotiations for its exclusive possession on the morrow; {{and by the time}} we were fairly installed in the inn at Shiwojiri, the bargain stood complete. In consideration of no exorbitant sum, the vehicle, with all appertaining thereto, was to be taken off its regular route and wander, like any tramp, at our sweet will, in quite a contrary direction. The boy with the horn was expressly included in the lease. By this arrangement we hoped to compass two days' journey in one, and reach by the morrow's night the point where boats are taken for the descent of the Tenriugawa rapids. We knew the drive would be painful, but we had every promise that it would be fast.|$|E

40|$|Spatial {{variations}} in the levels of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling are a critical determinant of dorsoanterior-ventroposterior pattern in vertebrate embryos. Whereas BMP overexpression abolishes both head and trunk development, known single and double loss-of-function mutations in BMP inhibitors have less dramatic effects. We report that combining mutations in the zebrafish genes bozozok and chordino causes a synergistic <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>head</b> and trunk, whereas most cells express ventro-posterior markers and develop into a tail. Genetic inactivation of BMP signaling fully suppresses these defects.

40|$|Morphogenesis of the {{mammalian}} forebrain {{is influenced}} by the patterning activity of signals emanating from the anterior mesendoderm. In this study, we show that procollagen IIA (IIA), an isoform of the cartilage extracellular matrix protein encoded by an alternatively spliced transcript of Col 2 a 1, is expressed in the prechordal plate and the anterior definitive endoderm. In the absence of IIA activity, the null mutants displayed a partially penetrant phenotype of <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>head</b> tissues, holoprosencephaly, and loss of mid-facial structures, which is associated with reduced sonic hedgehog (Shh) expression in the prechordal mesoderm.
