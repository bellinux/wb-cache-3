50|$|The late 1960s {{proved to}} be a financially {{challenging}} time for Chrysler Corporation, as tightening emissions standards and safely requirements spread resources thin. Consequently, the biennial mid-cycle face-lift originally intended to be the new model year 1971 corporate large car lineup was postponed one year. Thus, all 1971 Chryslers, including Town and Country, looked virtually unchanged from the prior year. One interior change planned that did make it into the 1971 cars was the instrument panel surround… Its upper bolster became a bit more massive, while the <b>lower</b> <b>bolster</b> was reduced in size eliminating the lower ledge. and the glove box door received a color keyed overlay. Standard tires for the wagons were enlarged to L84x15, a size shared with the Imperial, and unique to Chrysler Corp. Torsion Quiet Ride, comprising a set of tuned rubber isolators for the front suspension sub-frame and rear leaf-spring mounts, was added to wagons. It had been introduced as a new feature for all other Chrysler models and body styles in 1970. And finally, for the third time, front disc brakes appeared on the Town and Country standard equipment list… this time for good.|$|E

2500|$|Two-stage {{driver and}} front seat {{passenger}} frontal airbags are standard, as is Audi's [...] "sideguard" [...] head protection curtain airbag system. [...] This latter system completely covers {{all of the}} side windows, from the front 'A pillar' to the rear [...] "C-" [...] or [...] "D pillars". [...] The body-hugging Recaro shell-type RS race bucket seats (not available in North American markets), complete with electrically inflatable upper and <b>lower</b> side <b>bolsters</b> and adjustable lumbar support, are constructed {{so as not to}} need lower side airbags to comply with European crash safety standards. [...] In North America, the only front seats available are the more traditional Recaro seats (identical to those in the B6 and B7 S4), which include lower side airbags; these were also available as a no-cost option in other markets. [...] Lower side airbags are optional for the standard-fit Recaro rear seats. [...] Front, and outer rear seatbelts include pyrotechnic belt pretensioners, whilst all belts include an excess load limit function.|$|R
40|$|Innovative wheelchairs allow {{individuals}} to change position easily for comfort and social situations. While these wheelchairs are beneficial in multiple ways, {{the effects of}} position changes on blood pressure might exacerbate hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion, particularly in those {{with spinal cord injury}} (SCI) who can have injury to autonomic nerves that regulate cardiovascular control. Conversely, cardiovascular benefits may be obtained with lowered seating. Here we investigate the effect of moderate changes in wheelchair position on orthostatic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular reflex control. Nineteen individuals with SCI and ten neurologically-intact controls were tested in supine and seated positions (neutral, lowered, and elevated) in the Elevation™ wheelchair. Participants with SCI were stratified into two groups by the severity of injury to cardiovascular autonomic pathways. Beat-to-beat blood pressure, heart rate and middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (MCAv) were recorded non-invasively. Supine blood pressure and MCAv were reduced in individuals with lesions to autonomic pathways, and declined further with standard seating compared to those with preserved autonomic control. Movement to the elevated position triggered pronounced blood pressure and MCAv falls in those with autonomic lesions, with minimum values significantly reduced compared to the seated and lowered positions. The cumulative duration spent below supine blood pressure was greatest in this group. <b>Lowered</b> seating <b>bolstered</b> blood pressure in those with lesions to autonomic pathways. Integrity of the autonomic nervous system is an important variable that affects cardiovascular responses to orthostatic stress and should be considered when individuals with SCI or autonomic dysfunction are selecting wheelchairs.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} phonological awareness, phonological memory and rapid automatic naming abilities of adults who stutter and typically fluent peers. Many theorists posit that a delay or breakdown occurs during “phonological encoding,” or the retrieval or construction of phonological segments (Howell & Au-Yeung, 2002; Perkins, Kent & Curlee, 1991; Postma & Kolk, 1993; Wingate 1988). Efficient phonological encoding is predicated upon {{the ability to}} segment phonological representations in a rapid, precise manner. According to current theories, a delay or incomplete retrieval of lexical segments could impede {{the execution of the}} articulatory plan, thereby resulting in disfluent speech. Unfortunately, the process of phonological encoding is not directly observable and must therefore be explored though alternate processes that reflects its incremental nature. Phonological awareness, phonological memory and rapid automatic naming can be examined to accomplish this task. Several core mechanisms are utilized during phonological processing, and a deficit in any of these mechanisms could account for performance differences in phonological processing tasks. Completion of these tasks is dependent upon the quality of phonological representations in the lexicon, the ability to construct novel phonological codes online, and the ability to maintain phonological representations in memory. The process of redintegration, whereby pre-existing lexical-semantic knowledge is used to supplement decaying or delayed phonological code (Hulme et al., 1997), can also {{play an important role in}} the completion of phonological processing tasks. Participants completed several tasks examining different aspects of their phonological processing abilities. Significant between-group differences were revealed on nonlexical phonological awareness tasks, nonword repetition tasks, and rapid automatic naming tasks that used lexical stimuli. Adults who stutter performed significantly less well than typically fluent adults on tasks that used nonlexical stimuli. Adults who stutter appear to rely heavily on lexical-semantic information (redintegration) to <b>bolster</b> <b>lower</b> performance in other aspects of phonological encoding. Participants in both groups performed equally well on tasks that used lexical stimuli but not on tasks with nonlexical stimuli, indicating that between-group differences in phonological encoding exist. Differences in core mechanisms of phonological processing may reveal subtle linguistic differences that may contribute to an unstable speech system in people who stutter. ...|$|R
