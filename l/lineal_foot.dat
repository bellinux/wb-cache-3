A demonstration urban runoff treatment plant built by the City of Santa Monica provides similar water quality services as a 4, 000 - 5, 000 <b>lineal</b> <b>foot</b> riparian corridor does, and has annualized costs of approximately $ 1. 3 million per year ($ 2008) over a 50 -year period.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} demonstrate and quantify the thermal effectiveness of rigid insulation board when installed on the exterior of a buried concrete foundation wall. A heated, insulated box was constructed along one wall of an existing, unheated building to simulate the living space of a home. The crawl space beneath the living space was divided into two sections. One featured external foundation insulation, while the other side had none. 36 temperature and heat flux sensors were installed at predetermined locations to measure the temperature profile and heat flow out of the living space. The temperature profile through the foundation was then {{used to calculate the}} total heat flow out of the foundation for both cases. This experiment showed that a significant energy savings is available with exterior foundation insulation. Over the course of 3 months, the heat-loss differential between the insulated and non-insulated foundations was 4. 95 kilowatt-hours per <b>lineal</b> <b>foot</b> of foundation wall, for a ratio of 3 : 1. For a 2200 sq. ft home with a foundation perimeter 200 ft. long, this would amount to a savings of 990 kW-hrs in just 3 months, or 330 kW-hrs per month. Extrapolating to an 8 -month heating year, we would expect to save over 2640 kW-hrs per year for such a home. The savings for a basement foundation, rather than a crawlspace, would be approach twice that amount, nearing 5280 kW-hr per year. Because these data were not collected during the coldest months of the year, they are conservative, and greater savings may be expected during colder periods...|$|E
40|$|The primary foci in {{designing}} a duct system is: 1) Delivery {{of the correct}} amount of air; 2) Delivery of air at an acceptable temperature with minimum temperature drop; 3) Delivery of air quietly; and, 4) A system which is applicable to the project conditions. The Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Association (SMACNA) and the Thermal Insulation Manufacturers Association (TIMA), have done considerable testing on air loss and temperature drop on operating HVAC systems. It {{is important to note}} that these tests show that air leakage through unsealed joints is the most significant factor in heat loss. No amount of insulation can make up for a 24 percent air leakage rate in an unsealed, rectangular sheet metal system. Acoustical data is not as readily available.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research study is to evaluate the performance, maintenance requirements and cost effectiveness of constructing reinforced slope along a concrete bikeway overpass with a Geogrid system such as manufactured by Tensar Corporation or Reinforced Earth Company. This final report consists of two separate reports - construction and performance. An earlier design report and work plan was submitted to the Iowa DOT in 1989. From the Design Report, {{it was determined that}} the reinforced slope would be the most economical system for this particular bikeway project. Preliminary cost estimates for other design alternatives including concrete retaining walls, gabions and sheet pile walls ranged from 204 /L. F. to 220 /L. F. The actual final construction cost of the reinforced slope with GEDGRIDS was around 112 /L. F. Although, since the reinforced slope system was not feasible next to the bridge overpass because of design constraints, a fair cost comparison should reflect costs of constructing a concrete retaining wall. Including the concrete retaining wall costs raises the per <b>lineal</b> <b>foot</b> cost to around 122 /L. F. In addition to this initial construction cost effectiveness of the reinforced slope, there has been little or no maintenance needed for this reinforced slope. It was noted that some edge mowing or weed whacking could be done near the concrete bikeway slab to improve the visual quality of the slope, but no work has been assigned to city crews. It was added that this kind of weed whacking over such steep slope is more difficult and there could possibly be more potential for work related injury. The geogrid reinforced slope has performed really well once the vegetation took control and prevented soil washing across the bikeway slab. To that end, interim erosion control measures might need to be considered in future projects. Some construction observations were noted. First, there i s no specialized experience or equipment required for a contractor to successfully build a low-to-medium geogrid reinforced slope structure. Second, the adaptability of the reinforced earth structure enables the designer to best fit the shape of the structure to the environment and could enhance aesthetic quality. Finally, a reinforced slope can be built with relatively soft soils provided differential settlements between facing are limited to one or two percent...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the design and {{construction}} of rolled-fill earth dams with the standard methods of practice, taking the Hirakud Dam as the basis. The field operations of the investigation to obtain observational information and to secure samples for the laboratory testing include observation of rain gauge and river gauge readings, taking river water samples, digging test pits, drilling grout holes, opening drifts, digging borrow pits and conducting detailed topographical surveys. Laboratory tests are conducted on the samples {{and the results are}} plotted in graphs. Rainfall and run-off statistics are plotted in graphs. Observational information of geology is plotted in log sheets and the field data of survey works is made use of for the preparation of the topographical maps. From the results of the investigation it is found that the Hirakud Dam has a firm foundation and there is sufficient quantity of material for the embankment at site. The annual rainfall is 47. 49 inches yielding a run-off of 50 million sore feet over a catchment area of 32, 200 square miles. The stability of the embankment is computed by the slip circle method and the seepage water from the flow net method. The dam is designed for 100 years with a reservoir capacity of 5. 98 million acre feet at the maximum water level elevation 625 feet, the bed level being elevation 500 feet. The dead storage is 2. 24 million acre feet corresponding to elevation 590 feet, and the maximum submerged area corresponding elevation 625 feet is 150, 380 acres. The minimum factor of safety for the upstream slope is 1. 68 and that for the downstream slope is 1. 19. The seepage water is 0. 264 cubic feet per <b>lineal</b> <b>foot</b> per year. The dam is to be constructed as per the design and the specifications. The compaction is attained by the mechanical effort at the optimum moisture content. The mechanical effort is influenced by the type of roller, its weight and the number of passes. Field control is affected by vigilant supervision, needle penetration, ring test and sand test. The construction is to be carried out according to a plan of seven stages. A comparison and contrast is drawn between the U. S. A. and India to bring out the inherent difficulties of construction operations of large dams in India. Importance is given to the sequence of the subject matter since no text book gives all the relevant portions as used in practice. Reference is given to the text books from which the formulas are taken so that a student who is interested in theory, derivation and explanation of the formulas may study the available literature.

Besides the risk of striking the reef, it produces eddies on both sides of it according to the direction of the tidal currents, and is {{much in the way of}} vessels coming down in the ebb in the effort to hug the shore, and thus avoid being drawn upon Middle Reef. The explosives used in tunnelling at Hallett's Point have been nitroglycerine and its compounds, and gunpowder; the' latter being used only when the rock was weak and seamy. Nitroglycerine was always used for driving the headings of the tunnels. To drive a heading, the drill-holes are made at an angle with the fuse, so that the charge lifts out the rock by its explosion. A cavity being made in the middle of the heading, holes are drilled around it, and the surrounding rock blown into it. Only one blast is exploded at a time, as great care has to be taken not to shake the structure overhead by too heavy vibrations. There is consequently no volley firing, and the galvanic battery is not used for discharging the blasts. The average twelve months' work, with six Burleigh drills, was the excavation of two hundred and thirty-five <b>lineal</b> <b>feet</b> of heading per month. Up to June, 1872, the work had been prosecuted by hand-drilling, with the exception of 20,160 <b>lineal</b> <b>feet</b> of drilling by the Burleigh drill, and 7,000 feet by the diamond drill. That by the Burleigh drills was done by contract, at so much a foot; and the diamond drill, purchased for the purpose of exploring the rock ahead, was put in competition with it.|$|R
