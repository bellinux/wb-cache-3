5|$|At {{the time}} when the poem <b>Lietuva,</b> Tėvyne mūsų was written, Lithuania was part of the Russian Empire. Kudirka, a medical student at the University of Warsaw, was writing as a {{columnist}} for the newspaper Varpas (The Bell). In his Varpas columns, Kudirka urged Lithuanians to take pride in their heritage, discussed the problems the Russian Government was causing the Lithuanian population, and denounced those who wished to work for the Tsarist autocracy. In the course of writing for Varpas, he wrote down his thoughts on what Lithuania was and what it should be, resulting in the fifty-word poem <b>Lietuva,</b> Tėvynė mūsų ("Lithuania, Our Homeland").|$|E

25|$|In the {{earliest}} {{stages of the}} formation of the Lithuanian state, there had been several lands (Lithuanian: plural – žemės, singular – žemė), such as Nalšia, Deltuva and <b>Lietuva,</b> as well as others. They were ruled by regional dukes. When King Mindaugas (1251–1263) unified the state, he killed, expelled, or subjugated most of the regional dukes. The lands were either added to ruler's domain or granted to members of his family.|$|E
25|$|After {{the team}} was {{restored}} following Lithuania's return as an independent country in 1991, the jerseys used the same color schemes from the 1930s. Only this time, the neck, shoulders and sides had a three lined piping in the national flag's colors. The light variant had <b>Lietuva</b> in red, while the dark one had the country's name in white. It was manufactured by Reebok. This design remained until 1997.|$|E
500|$|The {{political}} situation in Lithuania, however, remained stable between October 1939 and March 1940. The Soviets did not interfere with Lithuania's domestic affairs and the Russian soldiers were well-behaved in their bases. As late as March 29, 1940, Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov delivered a speech before the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union expressing his satisfaction with {{the execution of the}} mutual assistance treaties with Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. While Lithuanian politicians publicly praised the Soviet Union for its generosity and touted the [...] "traditional Soviet–Lithuanian friendship", in private they understood this treaty was a serious threat to Lithuanian independence. The popular attitude was reflected in the slogan [...] "Vilnius – mūsų, <b>Lietuva</b> – rusų" [...] (Vilnius is ours, but Lithuania is Russia's).|$|E

2500|$|On June 23, 1941 at 9:28 am Tautiška giesmė, the {{national}} anthem of Lithuania, was played on the radio in Kaunas. LAF member Leonas Prapuolenis read independence declaration Atstatoma laisva <b>Lietuva</b> (Free Lithuania is Restored) – [...] "Young Lithuania with enthusiasm promises to add up to the Europe organization on the new bases. Lithuanian nation horribly tortured by bolshevik's terror braces creating its future on the ethnic unity and social justice". Prapuolenis announced {{the members of the}} Provisional Government and also asked the people to guard public and private property, the workers to organize protection of factories, public institutions, and other important objects, and policemen to patrol their territories preserving the general public order. The message was repeated several times in Lithuanian, German, and French.|$|E
2500|$|Lithuanian {{politicians}} {{attempted to}} show the regained Vilnius as a major diplomatic victory. The Lithuanian Nationalists Union, ruling political party in Lithuania since the 1926 coup, used celebrations of return {{of the city to}} increase its prestige and popularity. The government stressed its competence and the opposition emphasized Soviet generosity. While politicians publicly praised the Soviet Union and taunted [...] "traditional Soviet–Lithuanian friendship," [...] in private they understood this treaty was a serious threat to Lithuanian independence. Popular attitude was reflected in a known slogan [...] "Vilnius – mūsų, <b>Lietuva</b> – rusų" [...] (Vilnius is ours, but Lithuania is Russia's). After the treaty was signed, Lithuania lost its neutrality and could not independently execute its foreign policy. For example, Lithuania could not support Finland when the Winter War broke out after Finland rejected a similar mutual assistance treaty proposed by Soviet Union. In international politics, Lithuania became a Soviet satellite.|$|E

50|$|There {{have been}} several {{attempts}} to associate <b>Lietuva</b> with Celtic toponyms, and with Latin or Italian words, but these attempts all lack strong linguistic support. According to a widespread popular belief, the word <b>Lietuva</b> (Lithuania) originated from the Lithuanian words lyti (to rain) and lietus (rain). However, there is no serious scientific support for this theory. Since the word <b>Lietuva</b> has a suffix (-uva), the original word should have no suffix. A likely candidate is Lietā. Because many Baltic ethnonyms originated from hydronyms, linguists have searched for its origin among local hydronyms. Usually such names evolved through the following process: hydronym → toponym → ethnonym.|$|E
