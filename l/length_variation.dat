He grew a few inches in height, although he remained short for a fast bowler, and under Iremonger's regime of diet and exercise he gained weight. Besides his physical development, he learned by incessant practice various bowling arts, among them accuracy in line and <b>length,</b> <b>variation</b> of pace and grip, and deviating the ball in the air to produce swing. That year he played intermittently for the county's Second XI, and in a match against Lancashire Seconds took 8 wickets for 44 runs.|$|E

40|$|Yarns of warp beams to knit on warp {{knitting}} machines {{need to be}} wound at equal tensions. The tension variations lead to produce valleys and ridges of warp yarns on the beam and hence different lengths of individual warp yarns. These <b>length</b> <b>variations</b> lead to loop <b>length</b> <b>variations</b> in warp knitted fabrics and may cause defects along the wales. This research aimed at investigating the warp <b>length</b> <b>variations</b> caused by tension variations {{and its effect on}} the quality of the fabrics knitted. Tension variations of individual warp yarns on warp beams for {{warp knitting}} were examined. 16 % of warp yarns were outside the permissible tension range in practical environment. The length measurements of 1128 individual yarns of a warp beam show that 0 - 1. 7 % <b>length</b> <b>variations</b> exist among the yarns. The fabrics knitted at different tension values ranging from 4 cN to 20 cN show 6. 6 % increase in wale density. Although the fabric weight variation is below 5 %, the microscopic view of the fabrics shows significant change in the size of loops and rupture of filaments. This has caused visual colour difference in the fabric...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} common splice {{variations}} are small exon <b>length</b> <b>variations</b> caused by the use of alternative donor or acceptor splice sites that are in very close proximity on the pre-mRNA. Among these, three-nucleotide variations at so-called NAGNAG tandem acceptor sites have recently attracted considerable attention, and {{it has been suggested that}} these variations are regulated and serve to fine-tune protein forms by the addition or removal of a single amino acid. In this paper we first show that in-frame exon <b>length</b> <b>variations</b> are generally overrepresented and that this overrepresentation can be quantitatively explained by the effect of nonsense-mediated decay. Our analysis allows us to estimate that about 50 % of frame-shifted coding transcripts are targeted by nonsense-mediated decay. Second, we show that a simple physical model that assumes that the splicing machinery stochastically binds to nearby splice sites in proportion to the affinities of the sites correctly predicts the relative abundances of different small <b>length</b> <b>variations</b> at both boundaries. Finally, using the same simple physical model, we show that for NAGNAG sites, the difference i...|$|R

40|$|Motion {{analysis}} aims at {{evaluating the}} joint kinematics but the relative movement between {{the bones and}} the skin markers, known as soft tissue artifact (STA), introduces large errors. Multi-body optimization (MBO) methods were proposed {{to compensate for the}} STA. However, the validation of the MBO methods using no or simple kinematic constraints (e. g., spherical joint) demonstrated inaccurate in vivo kinematics. Anatomical constraints were introduced in MBO methods and various ligament constraints were proposed in the literature. The validation of these methods has not been performed yet. The objective {{of this study was to}} validate, against in vivo knee joint kinematics measured by intra-cortical pins on three subjects, the model-based kinematics obtained by MBO methods using three different types of ligament constraints. The MBO method introducing minimized or prescribed ligament <b>length</b> <b>variations</b> showed some improvements in the estimation of knee kinematics when compared to no kinematic constraints, to degree-of-freedom (DoF) coupling curves, and to null ligament <b>length</b> <b>variations.</b> However, the improvements were marginal when compared to spherical constraints. The errors obtained by minimized and prescribed ligament <b>length</b> <b>variations</b> were below 2. 5 ° and 4. 1 mm for the joint angles and displacements while the errors obtained with spherical joint constraints were below 2. 2 ° and 3. 1 mm. These errors are generally lower than the errors previously reported in the literature. As a conclusion, this study presented encouraging results for the compensation of the STA by MBO and for the introduction of anatomical constraints in MBO.
