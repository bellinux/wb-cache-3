50|$|Barrichello, with {{a clearly}} faster car, closed up on Ralf Schumacher, {{but was unable}} to pass for several laps as Michael Schumacher built up a 12-second lead at the end of 18 laps. Coulthard, who had been {{switched}} to a two-stop strategy due to his first lap collision, made his stop on lap 19, with Fisichella following on lap 20, then Räikkönen on lap 21. Meanwhile, Massa took 11th place from Jaguar's Mark Webber, the Australian suffering a misfire in his Cosworth engine. Cristiano da Matta was again the first to pit {{in the second round of}} stops, refuelling on lap 23, followed by Webber and Massa the following lap. Minardi's Gianmaria Bruni entered the pits, with the team engineers apparently unprepared for his stop. Soon later he retired from the race, citing a continuously locking rear brake, which made the car difficult to drive. Montoya stopped on lap 25, falling back from 3rd to 7th, followed by Button on lap 26, who was able to retain his 2nd position. Michael Schumacher pitted from the lead on lap 27, easily retaining his position, with an 18-second lead. Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello and Sato all pitted on the following lap, which saw Schumacher just retain his position ahead of Barrichello, the pair nearly colliding as Schumacher was released from his pit area. Fernando Alonso then pitted on lap 30, rejoining behind Ralf Schumacher and Barrichello, who were still close together on the circuit. Trulli then stopped the following <b>lap,</b> <b>splitting</b> Schumacher and Barrichello to take fifth.|$|E
5000|$|On August 26, 1893, at Holmes Field in Cambridge Mass., Conneff, {{representing}} Holy Cross Lycuem, {{started from}} scratch and easily overtook other runners {{who had long}} starts. His first <b>lap</b> <b>split</b> time was 59 seconds, his second lap 2:00. After three laps, he was at 3:07. He started to fall off his pace as he finished the race, but he nevertheless set a new amateur record of 4:17. (Walter George had run 4:12¾ in 1886 as a professional.) ...|$|R
50|$|PerformanceBox is a GPS based {{performance}} meter {{that allows}} you to measure G-forces, speed, <b>lap</b> & <b>split</b> times, 0-60, 0-100, braking distance and many more. The Predictive Lap Timing function (live comparison to best lap) gives instant feedback on the driving, and all parameters are logged to an SD memory card ten times per second for later review and comparison.|$|R
25|$|In 2008, Räikkönen scored six {{consecutive}} fastest race laps (in Spain, Turkey, Monaco, Canada, France and Britain), equalling Alberto Ascari's {{record for the}} most consecutive fastest laps in a single season and placing him one behind Ascari's overall record of seven consecutive fastest <b>laps</b> (which were <b>split</b> across two seasons: six in 1952 and one in 1953).|$|R
50|$|Kearns’ {{start in}} {{endurance}} sports was at Taft High School in Woodland Hills, California, where he ran cross country and track from 1980 to 1982. He was 17th in the 1981 National Junior Olympics Cross Country meet at age 15, and a finalist at the National Junior Olympics Track&Field Championships (Lincoln, NE) 1500 meters at age 16, winning his semi-final heat in 4:06, and achieving a national ranking of 12th in his age division. He placed 5th in the Los Angeles City Cross Country Championships in 1981, setting {{a school record}} of 15:24 on the Pierce College course that held for nearly 20 years, and still ranks in the top 60 all-time LA City section performances as of 2015. In Track&Field, he set a Los Angeles City Cee Division (i.e. - Frosh/Soph) record, winning the 1600 meter title in 1981 in 4.26.05. As a senior in 1982, Kearns placed 4th in the Los Angeles City section 1600 meters in 4:23, coming from 50 meters behind the pack on the final lap to take the final qualifying spot for the California state high school championships. At the state meet at Hughes Stadium in Sacramento, Kearns was seeded 24th out of 27th qualifiers, but was a surprise qualifier for the finals. He set a personal record of 4:19.30 to place fifth in his qualifying heat, again passing several runners with a final <b>lap</b> <b>split</b> of 59 seconds. He placed 9th in the state final 1600 meter race {{in a time of}} 4:20.|$|R
50|$|In 2009 at the Coke Zero 400 in Daytona, for the 25th {{anniversary of}} his final, 200th victory in 1984, Petty was {{behind the wheel of}} one of his 1980s Pontiac racecars during the pace laps, leading the field for the first pace <b>lap.</b> The field <b>split</b> him and he {{followed}} behind the field for one more pace lap before he pulled it in.|$|R
50|$|Two common tactics for the 800 meters {{are running}} a {{negative}} split or a positive <b>split</b> between <b>laps.</b> The positive <b>split</b> {{is widely considered}} to be the more effective strategy, but on occasion experienced runners have been known to use a negative split to their advantage. A positive split is achieved by running the first lap faster than the second lap, and a negative split is achieved by the opposite, running the second lap faster than the first. The current world record holder, David Rudisha, runs using a positive split strategy. In his 2012 Olympic race, he ran his first lap in 49.28 seconds and his second lap in 51.63 seconds. Theoretically, an even split is the most effective strategy, but it is nearly impossible to achieve due to the race's length.|$|R
5000|$|The {{watch is}} {{controlled}} by three side-mounted pushbuttons. The upper left button turns on the backlight, cancels the alarm, resets the stopwatch or marks the <b>split</b> (<b>lap)</b> time, and is used for selecting settings. The lower left button cycles the modes of the watch: time display, alarm, stopwatch, and time/date adjustment. The button {{on the right is}} the function button: when used it starts and stops the stopwatch, changes the settings currently being adjusted, or switches between the 12- and 24-hour modes, depending on what mode the watch is currently in. In time mode, pressing this button for three seconds will make the display read [...] "CASIo" [...] if the watch has genuine parts or ones produced under legitimate license. Pressing all three buttons at the same time will fill all the cells on the LCD until any button is pressed again.|$|R
50|$|In 2001 Ray would {{continue}} to drive for Menard in the #2 Johns Manville/Menards Dallara-Oldsmobile Aurora. Ray continued to be an excellent qualifier with four poles in the series' first ten races but had trouble finishing races with a win at the zMax Atlanta 500 Classic at Atlanta Motor Speedway. Ray's relationship with Menard got even worse after the Indianapolis 500 where Ray qualified 2nd and would 40 laps before finishing 17th, 8 <b>laps</b> down. Ray <b>split</b> from Menard after the Belterra Resort Indy 300 at Kentucky Speedway while Ray's replacement, Jaques Lazier won in his second race in the car at the Delphi Indy 300 at Chicagoland Speedway. Ray would drive the season ending Chevy 500 at Texas Motor Speedway returning to AJ Foyt's team in the #11 A.J. Foyt Racing Dallara-Nissan Infiniti where Ray would start 13th and finish 8th in his only other top 10 of the year besides his Atlanta win.|$|R
40|$|Competitive and {{recreational}} runners struggle {{to maintain a}} target pace during workouts and currently have no easy-to-see visual feedback on their pace. Lack of real-time, easy-to-see pace feedback {{makes it difficult for}} athletes to maintain a target pace and thereby makes their workouts less effective. Some GPS watches provide pacing feedback, but they are impossible to read while running hard. Pacing is a basic yet essential component of track and field, no matter what type of running event is taking place. During practice, certain paces are prescribed to evoke certain physiological responses from athletes. For example, a coach might ask an athlete to run a pace in practice in order to increase their lactic threshold or their VO 2 Max, both very important factors of performance. Despite technology being a large part of our culture and sport, track and field is lacking in technological advancements to improve performance and marketability of the sport. Currently, an athlete can only check if they are on pace once a <b>lap,</b> using <b>splits,</b> but these handheld devices cannot show if an athlete is falling behind or getting ahead during the lap. The TrackPacer provides a continuous indicator of pace during the entirety of the lap. Essentially, it lets the runner know where to be every second, on every point of the track rather than once or twice a lap. The TrackPacer LED light rope provides a visual indicator of the desired pace for athletes to maintain. There are no other visual non-worn pace indicators. Presently, athletes rely on watches or other worn devices to monitor their pace. The LED light strip indicator is better than existing methods because it eliminates monitoring a watch or worn device and permits even a sprinter to determine whether he is maintaining target pace. The TrackPacer is superior to sports watches due to its convenient, easily viewed placement on the inner perimeter of a track...|$|R
40|$|Most Design Codes {{encourage}} the staggering of lapped splices in a section, such that {{a portion of}} the bars in the cross section remain continuous throughout the lap zone. A penalty on lap length may be imposed if all bars are lapped at one section. In the literature, however, most of test specimens have had all reinforcement lapped at the same section. Therefore, this work aims to present experimental results of several tests to study the behaviour of bond strength of lapped joints of bundles where only one or two bars are lapped at a section. For this purpose, four point bending test on 24 full-scale beams with two different bar diameter and different percentage of bars lapped at the mid-span have been carried out. All the beams have been designed with the same concrete cover and with the minimum amount of transversal reinforcements, equal to 0. 5 the area of <b>lapped</b> bars. The <b>splitting</b> and flexural cracking behaviour, the resistance and the ductility of the joint have been measured and compared with the results of the beam with continuous bars. The results are in good agreement with the semi-empirical expression included in the new proposal of fib TG 4. 5 (Bond Models) for the new Model Code...|$|R
50|$|While Sawyer {{would remain}} very {{competitive}} {{in the early years}} of the category, the early days were dominated by Jim Richards. Though it was Albury panel shop owner and Group E / Group A driver Brad Jones who would come to dominate the category, winning five consecutive titles during the peak of the series popularity, all in various model Commodores. Other notable drivers include: Greg East, Steve Harrington, Mark Seaton, Marshall J. Brewer, Gregg Hansford, Terry Wyhoon, Garry Rogers, Russell Ingall, John Faulkner, Steven Richards (the son of inaugural champion Jim), Tony Kavich, Adam Pay, Nathan Pretty and his sister Nicole, Jason Whylie, Eddie Abelnecia and Leigh Watkins who was the only driver other than Jim Richards to win the championship driving a Falcon. Even Australian touring car legend Peter Brock briefly tried AUSCAR in 1988 driving an XF Falcon (after his 1987 split with Holden). Brock qualified 3rd for his first race, the 1988 Goodyear AUSCAR 200 and actually led for a number of <b>laps</b> until a <b>split</b> radiator saw him spin into retirement. To his credit, Brock later admitted that he wasn't comfortable racing on the high speed ovals and his time in the category only lasted a couple of meetings. He did return however for his testimonial race meeting held on the Calder Park short (road) circuit in 1995 driving a VR Commodore.|$|R
5000|$|A very {{aggressive}} first hour of racing saw many attempted attacks reeled {{in by the}} race leader's Astana team. It wasn't until nearly the half the stage, about 40 miles, had been covered that a successful breakaway group of ten formed. They attained a maximum advantage of four minutes, but {{for the better part}} of the stage the time gap held steady between two and three minutes, as Astana was content to let them get that lead. On the descent of the one climb of the day, King of the Mountains leader Francisco Mancebo clipped a small rock and tumbled off his bike, suffering a concussion and elbow and hand fractures, which forced him to abandon the race and surrender the KOM lead to Jason McCartney. The riders took five laps on a finishing circuit in the city of Pasadena. On the second <b>lap,</b> an even <b>split</b> in the breakaway formed, with five riders coming 20 seconds clear of the others, but by the end of the third, the group was one again. On the fourth lap, Fränk Schleck attacked from the back of the group and got clear for several minutes, but was eventually caught. The last split saw Rinaldo Nocentini, Hayden Roulston, and Pieter Weening come free on the sprint toward the finish, with Nocentini winning the stage. The other members of the breakway finished 7 seconds back, and the peloton was 2' 19" [...] behind the stage winner.|$|R
