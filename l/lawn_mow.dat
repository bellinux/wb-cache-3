40|$|The {{navigation}} {{and control of}} an autonomous vehicle is a highly complex task. Making a vehicle intelligent and able to operate “unmanned ” requires extensive theoretical as well as practical knowledge. An autonomous vehicle {{must be able to}} make decisions and respond to situations completely on its own. Navigation and control serves as the major limitation of the overall performance, accuracy and robustness of an autonomous vehicle. This thesis will address this problem and propose a unique {{navigation and}} control scheme for an autonomous lawn mower (ALM). Navigation is a key aspect when designing an autonomous vehicle. An autonomous vehicle must be able to sense its location, navigate its way toward its destination, and avoid obstacles it encounters. Since this thesis attempts to automate the <b>lawn</b> <b>mowing</b> process, it will present a navigational algorithm that covers a bounded region in a systematic way, while avoiding obstacles. This algorithm has many applications including search and rescue, floor cleaning, and <b>lawn</b> <b>mowing.</b> Furthermore, the robustness and utility of this algorithm is demonstrated in a 3 D simulation.

40|$|This study {{measured}} the energy expenditure of four self-paced household and garden tasks {{to determine whether}} 55 - to 65 -year-old men performed them at a moderate intensity [3 - 6 metabolic equivalents (METs) ] and to predict the activity intensity via indirect methods. Resting metabolic rate and oxygen consumption were measured using Douglas bags in 50 men (X +/- SD: 60. 6 +/- 3. 2 years, 175. 8 +/- 5. 6 cm, 82. 6 +/- 10. 1 kg) who performed self-perceived moderate paced walking and self-paced sweeping, window cleaning, vacuuming and <b>lawn</b> <b>mowing.</b> Heart rate, CSA accelerometer counts (hip and arm), Quetelet's index, Borg rating of perceived exertion and respiratory frequency were measured as possible predictors of energy expenditure. Each of the four household and garden activities was performed at a mean intensity of > or = 3. 0 METs in both the standardised laboratory environment (sweeping = 3. 4, window cleaning = 3. 8, vacuuming = 3. 0 and <b>lawn</b> <b>mowing</b> = 5. 3 METs) and the subjects' homes (sweeping = 4. 1, window cleaning = 3. 5, vacuuming = 3. 6 and <b>lawn</b> <b>mowing</b> = 5. 0 METs). Comparisons between the two settings were significantly different (p < or = 0. 008). Except for window cleaning, the MET values were not {{different from those of}} our previous younger sample (35 - 45 years). Regression analysis yielded prediction equations with 95 % confidence intervals of +/- 0. 8 METs for both the laboratory and home environments. Although the energy expenditure means for these activities indicate that they can contribute to the 30 min day(- 1) of moderate intensity physical activity required to confer health benefits, there was substantial inter-individual variability. While the regression equations lack predictive precision at the individual level, they were able to determine whether energy expenditure was above the 3. 0 MET threshold with correct classification rates of 91 % and 94 % in the laboratory and home, respectively.

40|$|This paper {{shows the}} design of an open-ended, less {{specified}} project for remotely controlled lawn cutting robot. Since {{there is no good}} solutions in the medium segment {{when it comes to a}} concern for the environment we have chosen to approach our process in a respectful way regarding the environment. Quality is often reflected upon technical solutions and the level of advanced components the more advanced technology the higher risk of something breaking down. Historically lawnmowers are usually seen as products with high quality. They last for a long time, sometimes for several decades. The long life can be explained by the use of long-lasting materials and most often a solid assembly.
