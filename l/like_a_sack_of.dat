500|$|Denny Atkin of Computer Gaming World {{believed}} {{the game to}} be the first simulator to recreate [...] "the real feeling of civilian flying", particularly because of its graphics and ATC system. He considered its flight physics to be [...] "much better than Pro Pilot, although not up to the level of Flight Simulator 98". He finished by calling Flight Unlimited II [...] "a must-have for any general-aviation enthusiast." [...] John Nolan of Computer Games Magazine found that the new flight physics were [...] "more than adequate for the task at hand", despite certain [...] "questionable areas". He praised the graphics and ATC, but noted AI glitches with the latter. He summarized, [...] "Overall, this simulation is somewhat above average". Dean Evans of PC Gamer UK called it [...] "the best civilian flight sim we've ever seen", which makes [...] "Flight Simulator look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> old spam". He found the game to be [...] "immensely realistic" [...] and praised its terrain and simulated airspace. Similarly, Edge praised the believable and highly detailed environment, noting that Looking Glass Studios managed to cleverly soften the contrast between photo-captured textures and polygon objects [...] "using haze as a real effect rather than a distance-clipping cheat". The magazine consluded that dismissing the game simply because of its lack of weapons [...] "would be a mistake", and explained that the interaction with the world [...] "is everything—it's reward enough simply to explore rather than to destroy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The project coordinators (including book {{publisher}} and publicist George P. Putnam) interviewed Earhart {{and asked her}} to accompany pilot Wilmer Stultz and copilot/mechanic Louis Gordon on the flight, nominally as a passenger, but with the added duty of keeping the flight log. The team departed from Trepassey Harbor, Newfoundland, in a Fokker F.VIIb/3m on June 17, 1928, landing at Pwll near Burry Port, South Wales, exactly 20 hours and 40 minutes later. There is a commemorative blue plaque at the site. Since most of the flight was on instruments and Earhart had no training for this type of flying, she did not pilot the aircraft. When interviewed after landing, she said, [...] "Stultz did all the flying—had to. I was just baggage, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> potatoes." [...] She added, [...] "... maybe someday I'll try it alone." ...|$|E

60|$|This time, lowered quickly, he {{sank into}} the chair <b>like</b> <b>a</b> half-empty <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> meal, and {{continued}} so to sink, until, crumpling at the middle, his great tawny head falling forward, {{he lay on the}} floor unconscious. His tongue, black and swollen, lolled out of his mouth. As buckets of water were poured on him he groaned and moaned. And here ended the first lesson.|$|R

60|$|Now, {{his horse}} being athirst, Sir Ector drove {{him into the}} ford that he might drink, and whilst he was there he was {{suddenly}} aware where, {{on the other side}} of the stream, was a singular party coming along the roadway. For first of all there rode a knight entirely clad in black, riding upon a black horse, and all the harness and furniture of that horse entirely of black. Behind him, that knight led four horses as though they were pack-horses, and across each one of those four horses was a knight in full armor, bound fast to the saddle <b>like</b> to <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> grain, whereat Sir Ector was very greatly astonished.|$|R
60|$|Elijah {{proved a}} bigger task {{than he had}} anticipated. A few inches at a time, resting in between, he dragged him over the ground and up a broken rubble of ice {{to the side of}} the boat. But into the boat he could not get him. Elijah's limp body was far more {{difficult}} to lift and handle than an equal weight of like dimensions but rigid. Daylight failed to hoist him, for the body collapsed at the middle <b>like</b> <b>a</b> part-empty <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> corn. Getting into the boat, Daylight tried vainly to drag his comrade in after him. The best he could do was to get Elijah's head and shoulders on top the gunwale. When he released his hold, to heave from farther down the body, Elijah promptly gave at the middle and came down on the ice.|$|R
60|$|During the {{conversation}} just recorded Dudley Pickering had been keeping a watchful eye on Bill and Elizabeth {{from the interior}} of a bush. His was not the ideal position for espionage, for he was too far off to hear what they said, and the light was too dim to enable him {{to see what it was}} that Bill was holding. It looked to Mr Pickering <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> or bag <b>of</b> some sort. As time went by he became convinced that it was <b>a</b> <b>sack,</b> limp and empty at present, but destined later to receive and bulge with what he believed was technically known as the swag. When the two objects of vigilance concluded their lengthy consultation, and moved off in the direction of Lady Wetherby's woods, any doubts he may have had as to whether they were the criminals he had suspected them of being were dispersed. The whole thing worked out logically.|$|R
60|$|But men {{are of a}} coarser clay. At least I am, {{and nearly}} twenty years had elapsed, and here was I {{burdened}} under a load of affection, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> returned love-letters, with no lap into which to dump them.|$|E
60|$|The borderman sprang {{over the}} table like a huge catamount, and with {{movement}} equally quick, knocked Case with a crash against the wall; closed on him before he could move a hand, and flung him <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> meal over the bluff.|$|E
60|$|As {{the women}} made no objection, {{those who had}} carried them from the house again raised them in their arms--Mrs Scholtz insisting, however, on being treated a little less <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>sack</b> <b>of</b> old clothes--and the march along the hill-side was begun.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought so; {{you never}} were one to {{think much of}} such things, and so it's {{probable}} that you'll get plenty of them, for it's what we care about we are starved in, just to make it hot for us poor humans. Take your father, for instance; he loves power, he does; he'd <b>like</b> to be <b>a</b> bishop of the old Roman sort what could torture people who didn't agree with them. And what is he? The parson of a potty parish {{of a couple of}} hundred people, counting the babies and the softies, and half of them Dissenters or Salvation Army. Moreover, they can't be bullied, because if they were they'd just walk into the next chapel door. Of course, there's the young gentlemen, and he takes it out of them, but, Lord bless us! that's <b>like</b> kicking <b>a</b> wool <b>sack,</b> <b>of</b> which any man of spirit soon gets tired. So, you see, he is sick-hearted, and will be more so now that you have stood up to him; and, in this way or that, it's the same with everyone, none of us gets what we want, while of what we don't want there's always plenty." ...|$|R
