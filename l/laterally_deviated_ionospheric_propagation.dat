40|$|MIMO {{technology}} has been suggested as an eective tool to overcome {{some of the issues}} typical of conventional OTH skywave radars. The advantages of the application of MIMO technology to HF Skywave radars is based on the transmission of multiple linearly independent waveforms and their separation at the receiver. Notwithstanding, the high instability of the ionosphere is responsible for severe signal fading and degradation that can prevent the separation with consequences on the radar performance. The present thesis is concerned with the problem of the eects of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>propagation,</b> which are analyzed from a theoretical point of view at rst, through the description of the ionosphere morphology and the disturbances that aect the ionospheric electron density structure. The relation between structural variations in the ionosphere and the transmitted signal parameters has been then derived. A radar signal simulator has been realized accordingly to the signal model proposed in the thesis. The results of the thesis concern three dierent aspects of propagation in HF MIMO radars. The orthogonality of the transmitted waveforms after <b>ionospheric</b> <b>propagation</b> is analyzed rst, while the eects of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>propagation</b> on the results of conventional beamforming is studied secondly.

40|$|Advanced {{users of}} high {{frequency}} (HF) radio communications have long used systems known as chirpsounders 1 to obtain real-time {{information about the}} <b>ionospheric</b> <b>propagation</b> conditions of different communication channels between a transmitter and a receiver. Traditional chirpsounders are expensive to realize and lack the flexibility of state-of-the art digital radio platforms.

In this paper, we report on our development of a prototype Software Defined Radio (SDR) chirpsounder system based on a commercially-available SDR platform. The accurate real-time picture of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>propagation</b> provided at low cost by such a chirpsounder can be instrumental in providing HF communications users with self-configuring link optimization capabilities that dynamically select the best channels {{to be used in}} an HF link, to maximize communications capacity and reliability. ...|$|R

Various programs {{have been developed to}} model <b>ionospheric</b> <b>propagation,</b> and one such program, IONCAP-PC 2. 5, is tested for accuracy over a transpolar communications link, using noncentric measured reference data obtained from the Univercity of Leicester.

The degradation mainly consists of a reduction of the maximum usable frequency (MUF) by as much as 50%. Sometimes the E-layer may be affected as well.
