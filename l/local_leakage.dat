40|$|The duct leakage in forced-air {{distribution}} {{systems has}} been recognized for years as {{a major source of}} energy losses in residential buildings. Recently, a measurement technique for estimating the total air leakage from residential duct systems, called Delta-Q, has been proposed.

This paper discusses the Delta-Q measurement technique and proposes improvements on its model to increase the accuracy of the total leakage estimations and to provide appropriate estimation of <b>local</b> <b>leakages.</b> Accurate estimations of the total and <b>local</b> <b>leakages</b> can help to focus the choice for both the right house and location in the duct system for performing the potential repair job.

A least-squares approach for indirect estimation of the sought for pa-rameters is proposed, which is linear in 6 out of its 7 parameters. The performance of the method, especially its accuracy {{as a function of}} measurement time, imbalance parameters, and signal-to-noise ratios, is investigated. The theoretical predictions of the performance are illustrated by Monte Carlo simulations as well as experimental data obtained from testing several universal software radio peripheral (USRP) receivers. The work shows that for the studied off-the-shelf receivers, gain imbalance and quadrature skew may be predicted accurately (i. e., < 0. 1 dB and < 1 deegre, respectively) by employing baseband data covering only a handful of full periods of the excitation stimuli.

40|$|An {{effective}} synthesis {{procedure for}} planar antennas realized with nonuniform metasurfaces (MTSs) excited by a point source is presented. This synthesis potentiates previous formulations by introducing a {{control of the}} amplitude of the aperture field while improving the polarization and phase performances. The class of MTS antennas {{we are dealing with}} is realized by using subwavelength patches of different dimensions printed on a grounded slab, illuminated by a transverse magnetic point source. These antennas are based on the interaction between a cylindrical surface-wave and the periodic modulation of the MTS, which leads to radiation through a leaky-wave (LW) effect. This new design method permits a systematic and simple synthesis of amplitude, phase, and polarization of the aperture field by designing the boundary conditions imposed by the MTS. The polarization control is based on the local value of the MTS anisotropy, the phase is controlled by the shape and periodicity of the modulation, and the amplitude is controlled by the <b>local</b> <b>leakage</b> attenuation parameter of the LW.

By estimating the expected <b>local</b> <b>leakage</b> power, we have diagnosed ambiguous pixels. Our criteria for ambiguous pixels (i. e. r_c) is associated with the tensor-to-scalar ratio of B mode power spectrum, which the leakage power is comparable to. By setting r_c to a lower value, we may reduce leakage level, but reduce sky fraction at the same time. Therefore, we have solved ∂Δ C_l/∂ r_c= 0, and obtained the optimal r_c, which minimizes the estimation uncertainty, given a foreground mask and noise level. We have applied our method to a simulated map blocked by a foreground (diffuse + point source) mask.

Some tubes were intentionally damaged by either a longitudinal-line cut or a single-point impact. Both types of damage were intended to simulate fiber breakage caused by a local damage. The objectives of the program were to investigate the failure modes of graphite-epoxy cylindrical tubes subjected to internal pressure, with and without local damage, and to qualitatively determine the relative burst pressure degradation associated with preexisting local damage to the tubes. A high-speed motion analyzer was used to record images of the fractures. The images provide the failure mode information that was not available in existing literature. Testing was conducted under three conditions: hydraulic pressurization, pneumatic pressurization with solid inserts, and pneumatic pressurization with inert propellant inserts. A tube with a longitudinal cut can fail by three different modes: a <b>local</b> <b>leakage</b> mode, a bursting mode with fracture initiating from the cut, or a bursting mode with complete tube disintegration.

The improvement of landfill cover quality and gas recovering systems are the main actions undertaken. As {{a part of the}} quality control, leakage detection is a main issue for assessing the reduction of LFG emissions. To achieve this task, two kinds of outputs are sought: (i) identification of <b>local</b> <b>leakage</b> areas and (ii) global estimation (at landfill scale) of biogas emission fluxes. Classical techniques usually focus on only one of these issues. Some of them propose assessment techniques for the total biogas emission of a whole landfill but without precise locations of leakage areas.

For 10 years, ISSeP is developing a simple and low cost local surveying method consisting in dense biogas concentration measurements achieved all over landfill surface with portable gas analysers. It is similar to instantaneous surface monitoring (ISM) methodology.

The multitaper-based spectral estimation (Anandan et al. 2004) {{has the advantage of}} reduction in variance and has been applied to the radar data. However, it has spectral peak broadening. An adaptive estimation technique has been presented to estimate the Doppler spectra, with certain parameters to adaptively track the signal in the range of Doppler spectral frame (Anandan et al. 2005). Several methods like wavelet-based denoising (Thatiparthi et al. 2009) and cepstral thresholding (Reddy and Reddy 2010 a, b) have also been used for spectrum cleaning and then Doppler spectrum estimation leading to the calculation of wind velocities. According to (Reddy and Reddy 2010 a, b), a polyphase approach was employed for spectrum estimation using uniform filter banks. Recent studies applied principal component analysis (PCA) on the radar data, prior to periodogram estimation using Blackman–Tukey, and minimum variance methods (Uma Maheswara Rao et al. 2014). All the existing methods used in spectral estimation for atmospheric radar data falls under two estimation methods either parametric or nonparametric. However, parametric method requires the prior knowledge of some parameters and nonparametric method has global leakage (peaks at unwanted frequencies) and <b>local</b> <b>leakage</b> (main beam limits). In the present study, the iterative adaptive approach (IAA) (Yardibi et al. 2010) is put into use to estimate the spectrum of MST radar data collected from NARL.
