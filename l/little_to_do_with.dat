5|$|Belgian comics artist Willy Vandersteen {{created his}} own version of the TV show with a collie named Bessy in 1954. Apart from the fact that his comic strip starred the same dog breed with a similar name it had <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the series overall, since the comic was a western comic.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} times when players and even entire teams carry on {{personal}} rivalries that have <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> individual games; fights frequently occur {{for no other}} reason. A rivalry that produced many fights was between the Detroit Red Wings and the Colorado Avalanche during the 1990s.|$|E
50|$|Similar to many made-for-television sequels, {{the film}} {{received}} poor reviews for having <b>little</b> <b>to</b> nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the previous films, poor acting and terrible special effects. It currently holds 2.7 on IMDB.|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "island mentality" [...] is {{also used}} in some {{psychological}} research to describe individuals who dislike or have problems with relating to others, and then live as loners or [...] "islands".

5|$|The Mafia of Villalba was of {{relatively}} recent origin, {{as it did}} {{not go back to}} the 1860s, considered to be the period when the Mafia emerged around Palermo. It started as a form of private protection and has <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> large estates {{as was the case in}} many other rural areas where many mafiosi started as caretakers and lease-holders (gabelloto or bailiff) for absentee landlords.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{the natives}} gave overt clues {{that they were}} displeased with the {{settlement}} being formed there. The property had supposedly been secured by {{an agent of the}} Dutch West India Company in 1640, but the negotiation was transacted with members of the Siwanoy people in distant Norwalk, and the local natives likely had <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> that transaction, if they even knew of it at all. Hutchinson was therefore taking a considerable risk in putting a permanent dwelling at this site.|$|E
5|$|Willson's {{interventions}} ultimately had <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> {{the end of}} the violence. In 1908, {{the courts}} began handing down convictions against the Night Riders, though many of their leaders escaped the convictions. A 1909 measure sponsored by Kentucky representative Augustus O. Stanley removed a national tax on tobacco, and in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found the American Tobacco Company to be in violation of antitrust laws. Each of these events helped raise tobacco prices, pacifying the violent farmers.|$|E

5|$|At the time, the EC {{viewed the}} {{agreement}} {{as a method}} of defusing the crisis and failed to attribute the lull which coincided with the Brioni Agreement to a shift in Serbian strategy instead. The EC delegation's failure to respond to Jović's departure before the plenary meeting and the EC foreign ministers' declaration of 10 July indicating the EC would withdraw from mediation if the Brioni Agreement was not implemented only encouraged Serbia which, unlike Slovenia, Croatia, or the Yugoslav federation, had nothing to lose if the EC pulled out. In the end, the EC took credit for a rapid resolution of the armed conflict in Slovenia without realising that its diplomatic efforts had <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the situation on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the early}} {{success of the}} series, three video games based on the series were {{released}} by Acclaim Entertainment. A first-person shooter simply titled South Park was released in 1998 for the PC, Nintendo 64, and PlayStation. This was followed in 1999 by , a party video game featuring quizzes and mini-games, on the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC. In 2000, South Park Rally, a racing game, was released on the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC. Parker and Stone had <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> {{the development of these}} games, apart from providing voice acting, and have publicly criticized Acclaim {{and the quality of the}} South Park games they produced.|$|E
5|$|From January to April 1916, Kippenberger {{underwent}} {{basic training}} at Trentham Military Camp {{as part of}} the 12th Reinforcement of the NZEF. On 1 May, he embarked for Europe to join the New Zealand Division. However, during transit his transport ship was unexpectedly diverted to Egypt. For two months, his contingent was based at the training camp of the Australian Imperial Force at Tel-el-Kebir but had very <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> only a few hours of training each day. The 12th Reinforcement left in July for Sling Camp in England, where it underwent more intense training.|$|E

50|$|Burke is the co-writer of the 2012 film, Smashed, {{starring}} Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Aaron Paul. Burke co-wrote {{the film}} with director James Ponsoldt. The film is {{loosely based on}} Burke's own struggles with alcoholism and sobriety. Burke is open about getting sober {{at the age of}} 24, but most of her comedy and writing prior <b>to</b> Smashed has <b>little</b> <b>to</b> nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> that, focusing instead on the absurdities of day-to-day life.|$|R
5|$|In 2005, {{and again}} in 2008, the Mekong River flooded its banks, {{damaging}} hundreds of rural villages. Living River Siam joined with other NGOs to form the Thai People's Network for Mekong, which pointed to dams in China as {{the primary cause of}} the flooding. An intergovernmental working group called the Mekong River Commission opposed these claims, saying China's dams had <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the flood, although they also pressed China for data on the floodwaters. The back-and-forth was covered heavily in Thai press, which gave ample space to the statements of the People's Network.|$|E
5|$|Also {{a younger}} son, Gebhard had {{prepared}} for an ecclesiastical career with a broad, Humanist education; {{apart from his}} native German, he had learned several languages (including Latin, Italian, French), and studied history and theology. After studying at the universities of Dillingen, Ingolstadt, Perugia, Louvain and elsewhere, he began his ecclesiastical career in 1560at Augsburg. His conduct at Augsburg caused some scandal; the bishop, his uncle, petitioned the Duke of Bavaria to remonstrate with him about it, which apparently led to some improvement in his behavior. In 1561, he became a deacon at Cologne Cathedral (1561–77), a canon of St. Gereon, the basilica in Cologne (1562–67), a canon in Strassburg (1567–1601), in Ellwangen (1567–83), and in Würzburg (1569–70). In 1571, he became deacon of Strassburg Cathedral, a position he held until his death. In 1576, by papal nomination, he also became provost of the Cathedral in Augsburg. Similar to his opponent, these positions brought him influence and wealth; they had <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> his priestly character.|$|E
5|$|Angus died at Tantallon in January 1557, and {{the castle}} {{was seized by}} the Queen Regent, Mary of Guise. It was given over to the Laird of Craigmillar, and repairs were carried out the {{following}} year. In 1558, George Drummond of Blair was keeper of Tantallon, with a garrison of seven horsemen and 22 soldiers. James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton took control in 1565, {{on behalf of his}} nephew, the young 8th Earl of Angus, but the following year, Mary, Queen of Scots, gave the Captaincy to Robert Lauder of the Bass, and his son, Robert Lauder, younger of the Bass The appointment of the Lauders followed the surrender of Sir William Douglas of Lochleven, who was one of those charged with the murder of Queen Mary's favourite, David Rizzio, in March 1566. Mary visited Tantallon herself in November 1566. The Yester Writs record an Andrew Hume as Captain of Tantallon Castle in 1577. Following the death of the 8th Earl in 1588, the Earls of Angus lived elsewhere, and had <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Tantallon Castle.|$|E

5|$|Kerrigan {{returns in}} StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty (2010). At BlizzCon 2007, Chris Metzen {{explained}} {{that in the}} years after Brood War, Kerrigan relocated to Char, pulling back most of the Zerg, and has since been quiet. She has the power to wipe out all her enemies but has not, creating a tense state of peace in the sector. Metzen also indicated an interest in exploring if there was any humanity left in Kerrigan or if she is beyond redemption in her current state. He revealed that Kerrigan's withdrawal has <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> any suspicion she has of Duran, who is revealed towards the end of Brood War to be conducting secret experiments on creating a Protoss/Zerg hybrid; she does not know much about him, but in the time after Brood War, she is beginning to piece together the puzzle surrounding his motives. At BlizzCon 2008, Kerrigan made two brief appearances in cinematic trailers, one during an attack on a Terran city that was captured on video, and again in a series of caverns where Zeratul was studying ancient runes; in the latter, Kerrigan implies she has been waiting for his arrival.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} {{hypotheses}} have been discredited or rejected. For example, {{there is no}} hole {{at the end of}} the crest for a snorkeling function. There are no muscle scars for a proboscis and it is dubious that an animal with a beak would need one. As a proposed airlock, it would not have kept out water. The proposed air reservoir would have been insufficient for an animal the size of Parasaurolophus. Other hadrosaurids had large heads without needing large hollow crests to serve as attachment points for supporting ligaments. Also, none of the proposals explain why the crest has such a shape, why other lambeosaurines should have crests that look much different but perform a similar function, how crestless or solid-crested hadrosaurids got along without such capabilities, or why some hadrosaurids had solid crests. These considerations particularly impact hypotheses based on increasing the capabilities of systems already present in the animal, such as the salt gland and olfaction hypotheses, and indicate that these were not primary functions of the crest. Additionally, work on the nasal cavity of lambeosaurines shows that olfactory nerves and corresponding sensory tissue were largely outside the portion of the nasal passages in the crest, so the expansion of the crest had <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} war in New England was the Pequot War of 1637. The war's roots {{go back to}} 1632, when a dispute arose between Dutch fur traders and Plymouth {{officials}} {{over control of the}} Connecticut River Valley near modern Hartford, Connecticut. Representatives from the Dutch East India Company and Plymouth Colony both had deeds which claimed that they had rightfully purchased the land from the Pequots. A sort of land rush occurred as settlers from Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies tried to beat the Dutch in settling the area; the influx of English settlers also threatened the Pequot. Other confederations in the area sided with the English, including the Narragansetts and Mohegans, who were the traditional enemies of the Pequots. The event that sparked formal hostilities was the capture of a boat and the murder of its captain John Oldham in 1636, an event blamed on allies of the Pequots. In April 1637, a raid on a Pequot village by John Endicott led to a retaliatory raid by Pequot warriors on the town of Wethersfield, Connecticut, where some 30 English settlers were killed. This led to a further retaliation, where a raid led by Captain John Underhill and Captain John Mason burned a Pequot village to the ground near modern Mystic, Connecticut, killing 300 Pequots. Plymouth Colony had <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the actual fighting in the war.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{indicate}} that incarcerating young offenders {{is not the}} most effective way of curbing delinquency and reducing crime. The relationship between detention of young offenders and the rate of overall youth criminality is not evident. A study of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's arrest data for the 1990s reveals that the rise in detention was unrelated to crime rates. That is, detention as a tactic of controlling young offenders has <b>little</b> <b>to</b> nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the rate of crime or the “threat” that youth pose to the public.|$|R

5|$|The social {{structures}} of the red-throated bee-eater and the white-fronted bee-eaters {{have been described as}} more complex than for any other bird species. The birds exist in colonies located on nesting cliffs, and have a stable structure all year round. These colonies typically contain five to 50 burrows, occasionally up to 200, and are composed of clans of two or three pairs, their helpers, and their offspring. The helpers are male offspring from a previous year. Within the colony, the males alternate between guarding their mate and attempting to make forced copulations with other females. The females in turn attempt to lay eggs in their neighbour's nests, an example of brood parasitism. Some individuals also specialise in kleptoparasitism, stealing prey collected by other colony members. The colony's daily routine is to emerge from the nesting holes or roosting branches soon after dawn, preen and sun themselves for an hour, then disperse to feed. Feeding territories are divided by clan, with each clan defending its territory from all others of the same species, including clans of the same colony. The clans return to the colony before dusk, and engage in more social behaviour before retiring for the night. Colonies are situated several hundred metres apart and have <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> each other, although young individuals may disperse between colonies. As such these species can be thought to have four tiers of social kinship, the individual pair, the family unit, the clan and the colony as a whole.|$|E
