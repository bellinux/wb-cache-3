A dead branch will at some point decay back to the parent stem and fall off. This is normally a slow process but can be quickened by high winds or extreme temperature. The main reason deadwooding is performed is safety. Situations that usually demand removal of deadwood is trees that overhang public roads, houses, public areas and gardens. Trees located in wooded areas are usually assessed as lower risk but assessments consider the amount of visitors. Usually, trees adjacent to footpaths and access roads are considered for deadwood removal.|$|E
50|$|Because of its {{attractiveness}} {{and ease}} of cultivation, parrot feather has been introduced worldwide for use in indoor and outdoor aquaria. It is also a popular aquatic garden plant. However, it has escaped cultivation and spread via plant fragments and intentional plantings. While parrot feather may provide cover for some aquatic organisms, it can seriously change the physical and chemical characteristics of lakes and streams. The parrot feather grows abundantly, shades out naturally occurring algae, and clogs irrigation ducts and canals. The Parrot feather typically exist in bundles and extend out of the water. In large numbers, the plants make a dense mat on the water's surface. Because of this, they shade the water from sunlight and cause native plants to die because of <b>light</b> <b>deficiency.</b> The organisms that feed on the native plants can die off due to starvation. The dense mats also cause problems for recreation. Swimmers and boat propellors can become entangled. The mats are also {{a breeding ground for}} mosquitos.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to thyroid gland, Vitamin D plays {{crucial role in}} absorption of calcium. In fact, Vitamin D is needed for efficient absorption of calcium and therefore proper bone health. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, as well, it is unique because it is considered as a hormone; synthesized endogenously in the liver in form of Cholecalciferol. The endogenous inactive form of Vitamin D is Cholecalciferol or Vitamin D3 which is converted to active form of Vitamin D-Calcitriol also known as 1, 25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol in the Kidney upon exposure to UV ray of sun <b>light.</b> <b>Deficiency</b> in Vitamin D or renal disease contributes to bone disorder such as in Osteomalacia in adult and Rickets in children. Osteomalacia is the softening of bones due to poor bone mineralization which is in turn due to poor calcium absorption. Ultimately, these hormonal changes in body; such as function of thyroid, parathyroid, liver and kidney disrupts metabolic changes as well as function of specific organs, which in turn leads to condition that are not desirable such as bone disorders or other endocrine related diseases.|$|E

In our case, an image-feature-based monocular vision technique determines only the heading of the vehicle while the vehicle's odometry is used to estimate the distance traveled. We present a mathematical proof and experimental evidence indicating that the localization error of a robot guided by this principle is bound.

Protective immunity against Listeria monocytogenes and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection requires both antigen-specific CD 41 and CD 81 T cells. Using LIGHT-deficient mice we determined that LIGHT was necessary for optimal re-stimulation of anti-listerial CD 81 T cells in vitro. By contrast, LIGHT 2 / 2 mice infected with L. monocytogenes generated equivalent T-cell responses and controlled the infection as effectively as normal C 57 BL/ 6 mice.

40|$|Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) {{seedlings}} contain four {{alanine aminotransferase}} (AlaAT) homologues. Two of them encode AlaAT enzymes, whereas two homologues act as glumate:glyoxylate aminotransferase (GGAT). To address {{the function of}} the distinct AlaAT homologues a comparative examination of the changes in transcript level together with the enzyme activity and alanine and glutamate content in wheat seedlings subjected to low oxygen availability, nitrogen and <b>light</b> <b>deficiency</b> has been studied. Shoots of wheat seedlings were more tolerant to hypoxia than the roots as judging on the basis of enzyme activity and transcript level. Hypoxia induced AlaAT 1 earlier in roots than in shoots, while AlaAT 2 and GGAT were unaffected. The increase in AlaAT activity lagged behind the increase in alanine content. Nitrogen deficiency has little effect on the activity of GGAT. In contrast, lower activity of AlaAT and the level of mRNA for AlaAT 1 and AlaAT 2 in wheat seedlings growing on a nitrogen-free medium seems to indicate that AlaAT is regulated by the availability of nitrogen. Both AlaAT and GGAT activities were present in etiolated wheat seedlings but their activity was half of that observed in light-grown seedlings. Exposure of etiolated seedlings to light caused an increase in enzyme activities and up-regulated GGAT 1. It is proposed that hypoxia-induced AlaAT 1 and light-induced peroxisomal GGAT 1 appears to be crucial for the regulation of energy availability in plants grown under unfavourable environmental conditions...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A major {{obstacle}} to the application of microalgae for bio-fuel production is light intensity reduction in high density cultures. Mixotrophic operation can solve this problem by exploiting the ability of microalgae to grow on organiccarbon in dark conditions. In this article, mixotrophic growth of Nannochloropsis oculata and Chlorella vulgaris is analyzed. The influence of nitrate and glucose concentration on cell growth in 300 mL Erlenmeyer flasks was investigated using an experimental factorial design. The analysis was extended and validated by analyzing mixotrophic growth in a 6 L bubble column. RESULTS: The addition of glucose at concentration 0. 1 g L- 1 inhibited or enhanced the growth of Chlorella depending on nitrate concentration, while it increased {{the growth rate of}} Nannochloropsis at all nitrate concentrations tested. Statistically significant interaction between glucose and nitrate concentration was revealed for Chlorella; negligible interaction was found for Nannochloropsis. A kinetic characterization, shedding light on the influence of glucose on microalgal growth, was conducted through identification of a Monod-like model. Experimental tests in 6 L bubble column confirmed for both Chlorella and Nannochloropsis the possibility to significantly enhance growth in the presence of <b>light</b> <b>deficiency</b> through mixotrophic operation.

40|$|Linnaea borealis, the twinflower, is {{considered}} a critically endangered species in the Południowopodlaska Lowland. The disappearance of the twinflower is mainly caused by habitat changes resulting from forest management, but also <b>light</b> <b>deficiency</b> due {{to the increase in}} canopy cover and growth of the shrub layer (processes of succession). The aim of the paper is to present the actual distribution and phytosociological characteristics of L. borealis {{in the northern part of}} the Południowopodlaska Lowland. In this region, only three out of ten known areas of occurrence (Werchliś, Serpelice, Grala-Dąbrowizna) have endured to the present day. The twinflower occurs in pine forest, Peucedano-Pinetum, and mixed forest, Querco roboris-Pinetum, communities. A decrease in the ground cover of twinflower populations was observed in all existing twinflower locations. Although the area covered by the Linnaea borealis population in Werchliś increased tenfold during the last 20 years (from about 200 m 2 in 1993 to 1970 m 2 in 2013), its cover-abundance according to the Braun-Blanquet scale decreased from 5 to 3. The increase in the area covered by the twinflower population together with the accompanying decrease in cover-abundance is probably not a manifestation of species dynamics but rather a response to disadvantageous environmental changes (growth of canopy cover and shrub layer). Progressive light reduction can initiate the process of fragmentation of a population. A decrease in the cover-abundance of the L. borealis population (from 4 to 2) was also observed in Serpelice.

It is recognized that an extension of the Tomo PIV technique to a large depth of view along <b>light</b> <b>deficiency</b> gives a set of problems linked with the optical opacity limit, the uncertainty of reconstruction by few projections and the increasing of the ghost particles number.

40|$|A free-swimming dinoflagellate, Amphidinium operculatum var. gibbosum, strain S 1 - 36 - 5, was {{previously}} reported {{to produce a}} series of antitumor metabolites, amphidinolides. In this dissertation research, the chemical profiles of the cells from different cultures were examined. The results showed that large amounts of amphidinolide B were found only in the older cells (17 days old). However, relatively large amounts of caribenolide 1, the most potent antitumor macrolide found in this species, were {{also found in the}} younger cells (7 days old). This result indicated that caribenolide I can be produced in a more efficient way (e. g. continuous culture). Four major cytotoxic compounds, amphidinolides B, G, H and caribenolide I, were isolated from the cells harvested from a semi-continuous culture by chromatography and characterized by spectroscopic techniques. Amphidinolide G was isolated for the first time from A. operculatum var. gibbosum. In contrast, no amphidinolide was isolated from the cells of a 15, 000 liter culture. Two lipid compounds were isolated from the second batch of culture, and their bioactivity is under investigation. The low content of the secondary metabolites in 15, 000 liter culture was thought to be due to the culture conditions, such as the <b>light</b> <b>deficiency</b> and the nutrient composition changes caused by the contaminants. ^ Studies on the production of extracellular metabolites of Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries indicated that the production of domoic acid depended on the age of the culture. The organism in the older culture seemed to release more domoic acid into the medium rather than keeping it in the cells. A novel extracellular metabolite, bacillariolide III, was isolated from the culture medium, and the structure was determined by NMR, IR, MS and UV-vis. The structure of bacillariolide III was related to bacillariolide I, a phospholipase A 2 inhibitor, previously isolated from the cells of the same organism. The biosynthetic relationship of the two metabolites was proposed. A preliminary experiment indicated that bacillariolide III seemed to stimulate the growth of another diatom Skeletonema costatum. ^ In addition, experiments were carried out as part of the ongoing studies on the biosynthesis of amphidinolides and domoic acid, and the results were discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports on}} studies of non-elongating subcrown internode (NE) in spring barley {{and its role}} in plant performance under reduced water use. Chapter 1 covers the inheritance study of NE. Chapter 2 reports a two year study of seeding depth and subcrown internode length (SIL) effects in performance of barley, wheat and durum genotypes. Chapter 3 reports on genetic and environmental factors that affect crown depth and crown root development under a one-irrigation cultural regime. The research was conducted between 1990 and 1993 under field and greenhouse conditions. The NE character appears to be controlled by a major recessive gene. Selecting the NE trait is relatively easy by conventional plant breeding. SIL variation is continuous and seems regulated by several modifiers that interact strongly with the environment. Expression of genes for SIL require deep seeding. Under field conditions and regardless of genotype, shallow seeding inhibited SIL but produced shallow crowns while deep seeding stimulated SIL but produced deeper crowns. Deep seeding increased yield, 100 -seed weight, seeds/spike, an days to anthesis, but reduced tillers/m² and plant height in most genotypes. Short SIL genotypes (≤ 2. 6 mm) were more favored by deep seeding than long SIL genotypes (≥ 8. 2 mm). The correlations of SIL and crown depth with yield and yield components increased with deep seeding. The time of crown root initiation varied tremendously among barley plants of CC XXXIX. Crown roots/plant could be predicted by leaves/plant (r = 0. 92; P ≤ 0. 01). Most plants in CC XXXIX had crown root initiation around the 3 -leaf stage. The rate of soil moisture decreased with soil depth. Soil moisture between day 7 and day 21 after the planting irrigation was depleted by 77 % at 0 - 2. 5 cm and by 40 % at 12. 5 - 15 cm depth. The construction of specific soil water tension curves based on soil moisture distribution over a dry period after the planting irrigation could be of great value in determining optimal seeding depth, choice of variety, and establishment of selection criteria for crown depth, and time of crown root initiation in a breeding program for reduced water use. Line P 4 had no-SIL regardless of light and population density. <b>Light</b> <b>deficiency</b> increased SIL of Seco and the Yemen line more than high population density. The internodes below the crown in P 4 are insensitive to light and population density, but internodes above the crown in the same line are as sensitive as Seco and the Yemen line. Screening for NE can be very efficient in the greenhouse at the seedling stage...|$|E

Basipetal translocation decreased in the blades of plants de-prived of potassium, even when deficiency symptoms were not visible.

40|$|Plants require {{water for}} growth and development, but {{excessive}} water negatively affects their productivity and viability. Flash floods occasionally result in complete submergence of plants in agricultural and natural ecosystems. When immersed in water, plants encounter multiple stresses including low oxygen, low <b>light,</b> nutrient <b>deficiency,</b> and high risk of infection. As floodwaters subside, submerged plants are abruptly exposed to higher oxygen concentration and greater light intensity, which can induce post-submergence injury caused by oxidative stress, high light, and dehydration. Recent studies have emphasized the significance of multiple stress tolerance in the survival of submergence and prompt recovery following desubmergence. A mechanistic understanding of acclimation responses to submergence at molecular and physiological levels {{can contribute to the}} deciphering of the regulatory networks governing tolerance to other environmental stresses that occur simultaneously or sequentially in the natural progress of a flood event...|$|R
