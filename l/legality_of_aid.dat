40|$|After Cyclone Nargis struck Myanmar {{in early}} May 2008, the ruling regime imposed {{conditions}} upon the receipt and entry of disaster relief. This {{was met by}} {{a significant amount of}} international condemnation which was often bolstered by invocations of the Responsibility to Protect (R 2 P) doctrine. The <b>legalities</b> <b>of</b> disaster <b>aid</b> refusal very quickly became a serious topic of academic and practitioner discourse. While the politics <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> donation is a much-studied terrain, the politics <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> refusal has, until recently, received less attention. However, a recent strain of research in political science has sought to remedy this imbalance. This article considers what international lawyers can draw from this discourse and whether such a perspective can inform legal reforms, notably those being currently proposed by the International Law Commission. As well as questioning assumptions regarding the apoliticism <b>of</b> disaster <b>aid,</b> this article also considers the links between humanitarianism and regime change, utilising the case study of Cyclone Nargis. The role of R 2 P and its muscular humanitarianism is also examined, as {{is the extent to which}} it informs the current ILC proposals. The final section of the article considers humanitarian perspectives and the waning influence of ‘new humanitarianism’ which challenged fundamental legal concepts of impartial, neutral, needs-based aid...|$|R

40|$|Although the new Criminal Code made {{a series}} of {{amendments}} to the criminal legislation, the regulation of the principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminalisation has not been significantly changed, but only {{from the point of view}} of the structure of governing rules. Thus, while the previous Criminal Code regulated through a single provision both the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminalisation and the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminal penalties, the new Criminal Code has split the content of the principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminalisation and criminal penalties into two principles - the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminalisation and the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminal penalties, by allocating them two separate articles in Chapter I of Title I of the General Part. In this article, we aim to examine the theoretical side of the substance of the principle <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> criminalisation and to analyse some of the most important legal issues concerning the application of this principle in the case-law...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this thesis {{is to examine}} the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> nonforcible counter-measures in {{bilateral}} contexts. The major questions addressed are as follows: (i) do counter-measures constitute an autonomous category of justification for wrongful conduct? (ii) if so, what are the conditions <b>of</b> the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> that category? (iii) what are the more significant collateral constraints on the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> countermeasures? and (iv) what {{is the extent to which}} policy considerations contribute towards the determination <b>of</b> the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> counter-measures? The study begins with an Introduction which indicates the scope and the outline of the thesis, the terminology employed, and the approach adopted. Chapters One and Two deal with the historical development of the law of reprisals with special reference to non-forcible counter-measures. Chapter Three is entitled "The status of non-forcible counter-measures in customary international law since 1945 : a preliminary sketch". Chapters Four, Five,and Six are devoted to examining the conditions <b>of</b> the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> non-forcible counter-measures, viz., (i) breach, (ii) prior demand for reparation; and (iii) proportionality. Chapter Seven examines some of the more significant collateral constraints on the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> counter-measures. In Chapter Eight an attempt will initially be made to examine the circumstances in which the performance of obligations under a treaty may be withheld as a counter-measure. The conclusions reached will then be compared and contrasted with the regime established by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Chapter Nine considers the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> counter-measures in the context of a commitment to peaceful settlement. Chapter Ten is concerned with the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> economic coercion, and also with whether the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> that concept has a bearing on the question of lawful counter-measures. The final Chapter summarises the major characteristics of the existing legal regime of counter-measures. </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{discourse}} {{is a comprehensive}} look at the offence of “rape” as a legal concept, taking into consideration, the premodial, mythical and legal beliefs and meanings associated therewith. It analysed recent statutory changes and developments {{in this area of}} the law, particularly under the English common law in contradistinction from the almost static provisions of some African penal statutes relating to the offence of rape. The propelling aim was to appreciate the difficulties associated with efforts to convict persons accused of committing the offence of rape and the <b>legality</b> <b>of</b> calling in <b>aid</b> corroboration in amelioration of these difficulties. It was observed that, the statutory ingredients of the offence do not accommodate such a practice. It became significant that the myths and traditional beliefs surrounding the claim of an alleged victim of rape imported the burden of a rebuttal on the accused. It was observed that sympathy {{on the part of the}} courts for alleged rape victims sway their decisions in favour of such victims. This emotional consideration by the courts may have informed he demand for corroborative evidence to seal all escape routes for the accused even when not statutorily provided for. Absence of corroborative evidence may on the reverse, favour the accused though the prosecutrix may concoct one to secure conviction. It was concluded that rape cases should be determined on the basis of the dry provisions of the relevant penal statutes devoid of extraneous considerations, such as corroboration...|$|R
