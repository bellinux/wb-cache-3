40|$|The study {{addresses}} {{the phenomenon of}} accumulation of rigid tracer particles suspended in a time-dependent thermocapillary flow in a liquid bridge. We report {{the results of the}} three-dimensional numerical modeling of recent experiments in a non-isothermal liquid column. Exact physical properties of both liquids and particles are used for the modeling. Two <b>liquids</b> are investigated: <b>sodium</b> <b>nitrate</b> and n-decane. The particles are modeled as perfect spheres suspended in already well developed time-dependent thermocapillary flow. The particle dynamics is described by the Maxey-Riley equation. The results of our simulations are in excellent agreement with the experimental observations. For the first time we reproduced numerically formation of the particle accumulation structure (PAS) both under gravity and under weightlessness conditions. Our analysis confirms the experimental observations that the existence of PAS depends on the strength of the flow field, on the ratio between liquid and particle density, and on the particle size.

General arginase activity decreased. Excessive <b>sodium</b> <b>nitrate</b> intake decreased NOS activity, but increased nitrate, nitrite reduction and general arginase activity.

25|$|Neither {{the use of}} {{graphite}} nor <b>sodium</b> <b>nitrate</b> was new.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} nitrogen compounds, which include bicine, <b>sodium</b> <b>nitrate,</b> ammonium chloride, glutamic acid and urea, on growth and microcystin (MC) production were studied in batch cultures. The {{results showed that}} growth and microcystin production were promoted by bicine, <b>sodium</b> <b>nitrate</b> and ammonium chloride {{and could not be}} supported by urea and glutamic acid. It is likely that the cells of Microcystis aeruginosa have no urease which can be utilized to decompose urea. Glutamic acid enters the cell and may interrupt the normal metabolic processes. This would inhibit growth and microcystin production, resulting in the death of the organism. Bicine kept the pH of the medium at about 8. 5 and offered a preferential environment for growth and microcystin production. Ammonium chloride could be utilized by Microcystis aeruginosa indirectly. During the process of assimilation, hydroxy ions were continuously consumed, which would lead to a reduction in pH to less than 7 and retard growth and microcystin production. In the presence of <b>sodium</b> <b>nitrate,</b> the metabolic and biochemical mechanisms, which use <b>sodium</b> <b>nitrate</b> as a source of nutrition during the process of expanding vaccination, were impossible to change in a short time.
