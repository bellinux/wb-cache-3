Theoretical studies of coaxial spray generation, single injector experiments under ambient and elevated pressure conditions using simulation fluids and the attempt to model the atomization process are described. The most important fluid mechanical processes leading to coaxial atomization and mixing as turbulence in the liquid jet, surface instability, surface wave growth, droplet detachment (primary break-up), droplet break-up (secondary break-up),evaporation and dispersion are identified and investigated.

Simulations of interface behavior using moving and deforming meshes are particularly difficult, since the quality of the underlying mesh must be maintained to obtain high solution accuracy. This paper addresses a few of the common challenges associated with such meth-ods, using simulations involving <b>liquid</b> <b>break-up</b> in axi-symmetric cases. Situations involving the manipulation of mesh connectivity and vertex positions are discussed in detail, including an efficient algorithm for the calculation of length scales at any location in the mesh. Additionally, thermally induced variations of fluid properties like viscosity, surface-tension (Marangoni surface stress) and non-Newtonian effects are incorporated to study droplet formation and behavior.

A careful trade-off between sufficient camera exposure time and tolerable motion blur yielded images of adequate contrast to successfully complete the investigation. As an alternative to high power continuous light sources the article explores the use pulsed light illumination for imaging applications of this type. In particular recent efforts utilizing pulsed light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are described.

40|$|In this work, lattice Boltzmann {{models are}} {{developed}} and evaluated for investigating the break-up of liquid jets. The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) {{is a relatively}} new computational approach. It is based on the resolution of physics at a meso scopic level. At this level, the linkage between properties such as surface tension and intermolecular attraction is more readily represented. Furthermore, the governing equations of the LBM are linear and, when compared to the non-linear Navier-Stokes equations, their discretized formulation is easy to parallelize for use on massively parallel computers. ^ In {{the first part of this}} work, an existing lattice Boltzmann method is assessed for accuracy through a series of increasingly complex studies. Single-phase Couette flow, channel flow, and flow in a lid-driven cavity are studied. The computed results from these calculations are all within a few percentage points of their corresponding analytical solutions. The two-phase problems of oscillating liquid cylinders and capillary waves are also studied and results are found to agree within 10 % of analytical solutions. A hybrid numerical method is proposed and evaluated, during this initial phase of the work, and it produces, over a large range of physical parameters, more accurate results than conventional numerical methods. ^ Initial work on liquid jet break-up shows that current lattice Boltzmann methods are inherently viscous due to numerical instabilities that occur at lower viscosities. Novel planar and axisymmetric, two-phase, multiple relaxation time (MRT) models are proposed to overcome this limitation. The models have several relaxation parameters, which can be adjusted to enhance numerical stability. These models are evaluated by studying oscillating liquid cylinders, capillary waves, and oscillating ellipsoids, and the results agree within 6 % of analytical solutions. Two novel single-phase binary fluid lattice Boltzmann methods are developed and evaluated to simulate two fluids with different molecular weights. Simulations of Rayleigh jet break-up are presented, and the predictions are shown to agree within 10 % of analytical and experimental results. Studies of two-phase planar and axisymmetric mixing layers and liquid jets, which show <b>liquid</b> <b>break-up,</b> are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The design and optimisation of a modern gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine requires {{a thorough understanding of}} the fuel sprays characteristics and atomisation process. Therefore this thesis presents a detailed optical analysis of atomisation, penetration and interaction of multi-stream GDI sprays under engine relevant pressures and temperatures. The characteristics of the fuel spray in a GDI engine have a great influence on the fuel-air mixing and combustion processes as fuel injectors must provide adequate atomisation for vaporisation of the fuel to take place before combustion is initiated, whilst also avoiding spray impingement on the cylinder walls or piston crown. In this study multi-stream injectors, to be used within GDI engines, are quantified using Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) on an atmospheric bench. This process allowed for highly detailed spray analysis of droplet velocities and diameter at precise locations, using a three dimensional traverse, within the injector spray. The aim {{of the study was to}} analyse plume interaction between separate plumes of multi-stream injectors. Three multi-stream injectors were subjected to testing; two six-hole injectors and one three-hole injector. The injectors differed by having different distances between the plumes. The effect of fuel type on the <b>liquid</b> <b>break-up</b> and atomisation was investigated using Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA) and Mie imaging. Mie imaging was also performed to capture images of fuel from a multi-stream injector as it was sprayed into a pressure chamber which was used to recreate the conditions found in an engine likely to cause flash boiling. In total, five variables were investigated: fuel pressure, ambient pressure, ambient temperature, fuel composition and injector geometry. Once processed, the recorded images allowed measurement of spray tip penetration and cone angle. Qualitative data on the change in shape of the spray was also available.

40|$|Spray {{formation}} and combustion are highly complex processes, which {{have already been}} subjects of intense modeling efforts. If fuel is injected in gas a two-phase flow is generated, and several models {{have been developed to}} describe the gas and liquid phases, the models chosen are of course important for the results. Also, the way a model is implemented is important, especially regarding the treatment of the <b>liquid</b> core <b>break-up</b> process. It is not possible to estimate a single droplet size distribution for the whole spray, hence a spray model should generate a local droplet size distribution in the spray.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study is to observe the fuel {{break-up}} process very close to an injection hole of a practical PFI injector and to examine the effect of internal structure on characteristics of spray behavior. In order to investigate the atomization process at the nozzle exit, visualization of spray structure was performed using an ultra high-speed camera (max. camera speed 1 Mfps) with a long-distance microscope. The visualized experiments were carried out using PFI injector in a closed chamber at the atmospheric pressure. Three main conclusions were obtained from this study. It has been shown that the liquid fuel column was injected. During the injection period, the spray indicates the quasi-steady state mode. Surface waves of liquid column can be recognized.

40|$|Low Reynolds Number <b>liquid</b> jet <b>break-up</b> in a {{gravitational}} field occurs {{in one of}} three modes; periodic dripping, chaotic dripping and jetting.

This work examines the flow patterns formed in small tube diameter (< 3 mm) and curved geometry flow systems for air 8 ̆ 211 water mixtures at standard conditions. Liquid and gas superficial velocities were varied from 0. 1 to 7. 0 (approx. 10. 01) m/s and 0. 03 to 14 (approx. 10. 2) m/s for air and water respectively to determine the flow pattern formed in three geometries and dispersed bubble, plug, slug and annular flow patterns are reported using high-frame rate videography.

40|$|The {{research}} here presented {{deals with}} a detailed experimental investigation of a Lean Premixed Pre-Vaporized (LPP) burner, designed by Avio S. p. A. for aeronautical applications. Main object of the paper is that of achieving an in-depth interpretation of the interactions taking place between the unsteadiness of a complex air flow field and the dynamical behaviour of a liquid-fuel film break-up. The experimental campaigns were focused upon the detailed characterisation of the unsteady air flow field {{as well as of}} the fuel spray dynamics in terms of velocities, diameters and spatial distribution of the fuel droplets. In order to perform the required measurements in a most accurate way, a 4. 73 -to- 1 enlarged-scale model of an LPP burner has been realised. Measurements have been carried out by means of multiple laser-based instrumentations, namely: Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA), Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Taking advantage of these measurements, it has been possible to capture and clearly observe the unsteadiness of the fuel release from the premixing-duct exit lip.

40|$|Relative drift {{potential}} {{was evaluated}} for {{three types of}} hydraulic nozzles (a flat-fan nozzle, a hollow cone nozzle and an air induction nozzle) spraying different liquids: water, emulsifiable concentrate (EC) and suspension concentrate (SC) formulations of phenmedipham dispersed in water, with or without addition of 4 different tank-mix adjuvants. The droplet size spectra were measured for these 15 spray mixtures using a Malvern Particle Sizer and characterised by the Volume Median Diameter (VMD) {{and the percentage of}} liquid contained in droplets less than 100 m (% < 100 m). Horizontal ground drift was measured in a wind tunnel, on glass fibre collectors using a fluorescent tracer dye technique. The relative drift of each spray mixture was characterised by the Drifted Part (DP) which is the part of the sprayed volume drifted between 2 and 6 metres. Although the nozzle type was the predominating parameter regarding to the droplet size spectra and the DP, differences were observed due to the liquids characteristics. The EC formulation produced a smaller droplet size and a greater DP than the SC formulation whatever the tank mix adjuvant used. For the different spray mixtures, the DP was poorly correlated to the VMD or the % < 100 m. However, correlations between the VMD, the % < 100 m and the DP of the flat-fan nozzle and of the hollow cone nozzle were significant.

40|$|The {{research}} of this thesis {{focuses on the}} study of sprays produced by twin fluid air-blast atomisers and the main objective is to study the <b>liquid</b> jet <b>break-up</b> mechanism and relate it to the downstream spray characteristics. Two different air-blast atomiser geometries are used; coaxial, where the liquid co-flows with the gas stream, and the liquid jet in a gaseous cross-flow. The thesis describes advanced and novel measurements to reveal the temporal and spatial development of the liquid flow and its interaction with the surrounding gas stream. Initially, the break-up process is studied by measuring the characteristics of the continuous liquid jet. Techniques such as electrical conductivity, high-speed shadowgraphy and optical connectivity were used to characterise the atomisation process. The latter is a novel laser-based technique used to illuminate internally the continuous liquid column by introducing a laser beam within the liquid nozzle, while a fluorescent dye in the liquid ensures that the whole volume of the liquid is visualised. The laser light propagates downstream while reflecting on the gas-liquid interface to be interrupted at the break-up position, where the light is scattered and diffuses widely. In the case of a jet in a cross-flow gas stream the fluorescent intensity images were recorded from two different angles to reveal the various features involved in the liquid jet structure. The study of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the instabilities and the developed surface waves on the liquid column can provide information on jet morphology and {{a better understanding of the}} physics that elicit the break-up phenomenon. For that purpose, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is applied to reveal the various flow scales and elucidate the mechanism of transfer of momentum from the gas to the liquid flow. The most energetic modes are used to describe the jet interface dynamics that may well define the formation of the downstream droplet sizes. Interferometric Laser Imaging for Droplet Sizing (ILIDS) was also used for planar measurements of droplet sizes and velocities. ILIDS images the scattered light from droplets in an out-of-focus mode at different streamwise distances from the nozzle exit to obtain interference fringe patterns associated with each droplet. The spacing of each fringe pattern is proportional to the corresponding droplet diameter. Instantaneous droplet clustering is measured along with the primary atomisation process and the <b>liquid</b> jet <b>break-up</b> characteristics are correlated with the downstream droplet sizes. Several time delays are used between optical connectivity and ILIDS measurements to capture the various classes of droplet sizes that travel with different velocities from the break-up region to the downstream spray location. The small droplets travel faster and move with a velocity similar to the gas flow, in contrast to the larger droplets, which are conveyed to the size measuring region with a lower velocity and, therefore, higher time delays. A conditional correlation method was developed to reduce statistical uncertainties. Negative correlations were found between the break-up length of the liquid jet and downstream number of droplets, indicating that they are inversely proportional. The relation between the break-up length and droplet Arithmetic and Sauter Mean Diameters seems to be more complex since a sinusoidal relation was extracted. The estimated correlation coefficients varied with time delay and a repeatable trend was observed which exposed the coherent behaviour of the break-up process and its frequency, revealing that it is not a random phenomenon, but rather a multifaceted mechanism governed by physical laws.

40|$|Liquid jets in subsonic crossflows find varied {{applications}} in propulsion systems which include gas turbine combustors, aircraft afterburners and liquid fuelled ramjets. In {{the wake of}} environmental concerns and rising fuel costs, there is {{a renewed interest in}} the detailed study of sprays and its characterization as applicable to propulsion systems. An optimal fuel concentration is desirable for propulsion systems to achieve stable ignition, high efficiency and lower emissions. In a gas turbine afterburner, fuel is injected transversely into the air stream through a plain orifice injector from fuel manifolds, distributed across the combustor cross section. In a conventional ramjet, air is captured and decelerated to a subsonic velocity by an inlet diffuser, before fuel is added to the air stream. Therefore the <b>liquid</b> jet <b>break-up</b> processes leading {{to the development of the}} spray plume along with its ensuing droplet distribution downstream must be reasonably well understood.

Among the investigations reported almost all of them have concentrated on the macroscale penetration aspects and detailed information about the spray characteristics such as drop size distribution in the near and far field is lacking.

A range of non-Newtonian detergent slurries were tested but the results are of wider application and parallel work was undertaken with water, ionic solutions and chalk slurries. Six centrifugal pressure nozzles were used and the drop-size distributions correlated as a function of fluid properties, pressure, fiowrate, feed temperature, and nozzle characteristics. Measurements were made using a Malvern Particle Size Anayser slung across a specially-designed transparent tower section of approximately 1. 2 m diameter in order to reduce obscuration caused by the spray and improve existing droplet sizing techniques. The results obtained were based upon the Rosin-Rammler distribution model and the Size Analyser provided a direct print-out of size distribution and the parameters characterising it. A Spraying System nozzle, AAASSTC 8 - 8, produced the optimum spray distribution with the detergent slurry at a temperature of 60 °C whilst operating at 1200 psi. With other fluids the Delevan 2. 2 SJ nozzle produced the optimum spray distribution operating at 1200 psi but with the Spraying Systems nozzles there was no clear-cut optimum set of conditions, ie. the nozzle and pressure varied depending upon the fluid being sprayed.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an Eulerian-liquid Eulerian-gas model for full-cone Diesel sprays. Current multidimensional models for Diesel sprays and combustion employ the Lagrangian-droplet Eulerian-fluid (LDEF) approach. One {{of the main}} limitations {{of this approach is}} that adequate numerical resolution cannot be used because it is valid only when the volume fraction of the droplets in a computational cell is less than 10 %. An Eulerian-liquid Eulerian-gas two-fluid model is developed in order to overcome the limitations of the LDEF approach. Eulerian field equations are solved for the liquid and the gas phases with interface transport terms coupling the two phases. Mass and energy transfer at the interface are modeled by equilibrium, whereby vaporization is assumed to be mixing-controlled, and non-equilibrium approaches. Momentum transfer is modeled either by a locally homogeneous flow (LHF) approximation or by a separated flow model where effects of drag and finite transfer rates are considered. Atomization is modeled either by specifying drop sizes at the orifice or by employing a model for <b>liquid</b> core <b>break-up.</b> Collisions and coalescence are modeled through a collisions rate and a coalescence efficiency. Changes in size of drops as a result of vaporization, break-up and coalescence are included by solving an equation for the interfacial surface area concentration. ^ An implicit finite volume numerical procedure with staggered grids is employed. The liquid and the gas terms are solved simultaneously by linearization of the interfacial transfer terms. ^ Comparisons of computed and measured results are presented {{for a wide range of}} conditions. It is shown that the two-fluid model reproduces measured liquid velocity and turbulent kinetic energy profiles in the spray with adequate accuracy. Measured entrainment characteristics are also reproduced. Comparisons with measurements of steady liquid penetration in a Diesel spray lead to the following conclusions: Vaporization is mixing controlled under Diesel conditions. At lower ambient densities drop size effects and separated flow effects may be important. In such conditions, the details of the intact core model become important.

Curtain coating is a lucrative method due to being able to coat {{multiple}} layers {{at the same time in}} one process. Combining many different components of fluid mechanics into one industrial process, fully understanding all the mechanisms involved in curtain coating is essential to fully utilise its potential of efficiently and uniformly coating multiple layers simultaneously. This thesis considers two of these components; film flow along an inclined plane and the stability of a liquid curtain, including both during and after curtain break-up, combining experimental and theoretical studies. An experimental investigation of the flow down the inclined plane of the coating die is presented, for a wide range of physical properties and parameters, with the results compared to a simple mathematical model derived from multi-layered film flow along an inclined surface. Furthermore, a mathematical model of a free-falling surfactant laden liquid curtain under gravity is derived. Incorporating the effect of an insoluble surfactant is found to alter steady state profiles, as well as stabilizing the curtain to small perturbations about the steady state. An experimental study into the <b>liquid</b> curtain during <b>break-up</b> is then presented, investigating the hysteresis phenomenon of curtain stability, as well as the origins of break-up and the speed of sheet retraction. Finally, a mathematical model of the spacing between the array of liquid jets that is formed after the curtain disintegrates is developed...|$|R
40|$|Liquid-Gas {{interactions}} and break-up processes {{are found in}} many technological and environmental applications, from Internal Combustion and Gas Turbine engines to food processing and manufacturing. Their complete characterisation at realistic Weber and Reynolds numbers is not possible, due to the vast range of scales integrated and the requirement of a ’minimum’ computational mesh size to capture these scales. To this day, {{a number of questions}} remain unanswered, with relative research still ongoing. It is crucial to understand such phenomena so that any technological applications can be optimised and the environmental impact can be reduced. Currently, there is a high need to develop appropriate numerical modelling tools that provide both mass conservation and accurate interface topological properties. Two common interface modelling approaches are the Volume of Fluid and the Level Set, typically coupled into CLSVOF methods to ensure improved surface representation and good mass properties. In this work, a novel in-house Mass Conservative Level Set (CMLS) method is developed and validated extensively. The CMLS novelty is in the Level Set coupling with the Volume of Fluid, being processed only when necessary, providing a faster and more robust approach. Doing so, some numerically imposed limitations due to the ’physics’ and ’stability’, are overcome. The novel CMLS is employed for primary break-up investigations, in a single liquid droplet and jets. Single droplet break-up remains a benchmark test case, as it provides good foundations for <b>liquid</b> jet <b>break-up</b> and spray atomisation modelling. In such processes, the main effective parameters considered are the Weber and Reynolds numbers, along with the Ohneshorge (droplets) and Dynamic Pressure ratio (jets). Contrary to most studies, this work employs the surface density evolution using the Σ − Y model. The droplet break-up cases, show a strong correlation between the break-up initiation time and the Ohneshorge number, whilst as the Weber increases so does the droplet complete break-up time. This is of particular interest as at higher Weber numbers, surface density effects be- come negligible and thus by definition the complete break-up time should in fact decrease. However, similar behaviours were noted in previous studies. The droplets surface density evolution shows a ’quasi-independent’ relationship with the gas Weber. In the jets, a strong correlation between the surface density and ligament formation exists. However, the surface density is ’quasi-independent’ of the liquid Reynolds and the gas Weber. The gas boundary layer presence in jets, shows to both reduce and delay any liquid/gas inter- face perturbations and the potential break-up. To summarise, the present investigations are generally in good agreement with previous studies, with minimal contradictions in cases. The novel CMLS capabilities show promising results both in the two- and three- dimensional space. This work provides good foundations for a slightly alternative research approach in two-phase flows modelling. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} the hybrid rocket {{propulsion}} {{has been known for}} a long time. In the case of HRE one propellant is liquid while another is solid. Therefore HRE can potentially have the advantages of solid and liquid rocket engines simultaneously. The attribution for reaching these advantages lies in the injection unit. The injection system is the main and practically the only system of control of a HRE. Therefore the injection unit defines the thrust and performance of HRE. The current status of HRE technology in Europe is sounding rockets and sub-scale ground tests. In order to pass on technology with real application, the European Commission supports the Operational Research Project on Hybrid Engines in Europe ORPHEE within the 7 th Framework Program (FP 7). The project aims to develop HRE technology, where the first applications of the technology could be booster engine and upper stage engine. The aim of this work is to contribute to the ORPHEE project by collecting and presenting {{the current state of the}} art. It is clear that the HRE specifies has specific requirements with regard to the injection system different from those for current liquid rocket engines and demand a unique injection system. Thus the dawn of this work is to review the existing LRPE injection systems and determination of kinetics of the liquid phase in the combustion chamber of HRE. The kinetics of the liquid phase in the hybrid engine, the different types of jet and <b>liquid</b> sheet <b>break-up</b> are examined. Furthermore a correlation between the different atomization processes over a wide range of dimensionless numbers is made. One of the main distinctive features of hybrid engines is the possibility of thrust variation. The different types of injection, which are used in rocketry, have been considered in this study. In case of hybrid engines shower head, self impinging, swirl injectors, and their combinations can be utilized. The atomization characteristics are defined by Reynolds and Weber numbers, which are dependent on pressure drop, injector design and properties of liquid propellant. The range of Reynolds and Weber numbers, in which the injector operates, defines the break-up regime of the jet (in showerhead injectors) or of the sheet (in impinging jet and swirl injectors) and defines the maximum size of the droplets injected into combustion chamber with the solid propellant. However, in order to choose the injector that gives the best droplets distribution, it is necessary to know the grain configuration. In a hybrid engine it is very important to achieve uniform distribution of liquid propellant over the whole surface of solid propellant. From this study, the swirl injector offers more than others because its characteristics are stable and can be varied over a broad range of parameters. Varying the parameters of swirl injection (tangential and radial velocity, nozzle angle) it is possible to get the desired distribution of liquid phase in a short combustion chamber. In the case of a long solid grain a uniform distribution can be achieved using a combination of swirl and impinging jet injectors. However, the choice of one type of injection gives a clear connection between the parameters of injectors and the desired combustion characteristics...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Variable Valve Timing (VVT) presents a powerful tool in the relentless pursuit of efficiency improvements in the internal combustion engine. As the valves have such ultimate control over the gas exchange processes, extensive research effort in this area has shown how valve event timing can be manipulated to reduce engine pumping losses, fuel consumption and engine out emissions. Pumping losses may be significantly reduced by use of throttleless strategies, making use of intake valve duration for load control, while alternative cycles such as the Miller cycle allow modification of the effective compression ratio. More recently, the value of single valve operation in part load conditions is exploited, bringing with it the concept of asymmetric valve lifts. Work in this area found the side effect of asymmetric valve operation is {{a significant change in}} the behaviour of the in-cylinder flow structures, velocities and turbulence intensity. Work presented in this thesis exploits asymmetric valve strategies to modify the in-cylinder flow conditions. The Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is a method employed in the fluids dynamics field to facilitate the separation of coherent motion structures from the turbulence. In the presented work, the application of POD to in-cylinder flow analysis is further developed by the introduction of a novel method for identifying the POD modes representative of coherent motion and those representative of the turbulence. A POD mode correlation based technique is introduced and developed, with the resulting fields showing evidence of coherence and turbulence respectively. Experimental tests are carried out using a full length optically accessible, single cylinder research engine equipped with a fully variable valve train (FVVT) to allow full control of both valve timing and lift. In-cylinder flow is measured through the use of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) at several crank angle timings during the intake stroke whilst the engine is operated under a range of asymmetric valve strategies. The exhaust valves and one intake valve have their respective schedules fixed, while the second intake valve schedule is adjusted to 80 %, 60 %, 40 %, 20 %, 0 % lift. The resulting PIV fields are separated into coherent motion and turbulence using the developed technique, allowing for analysis of each constituent independently. The coherent element gives insight to large scale flows, often of the order of magnitude of the cylinder. These structures not only give a clear indication of the overall motion and allow assessment of flow characteristics such as swirl and tumble ratio, but the variation in the spatial location of these structures provides additional insight to the cyclic to cycle variation (CCV) of the flow, which would not otherwise be possible due to the inclusion of the turbulent data. Similarly, with the cyclic variation removed from the turbulent velocity field, a true account of the fluctuating velocity, u' and derived values such as the Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) may be gained. Results show how manipulation of a one intake valve timing can influence both the large scale motions and the turbulence intensity. By the reduction of lift, the swirl ratio is increased almost linearly as the typical counter-rotating vortex pair becomes asymmetric, before a single vortex structure is observed in the lowest lift cases. A switching mechanism between the two is identified and found to be responsible for increased levels of CCV. With the reduction in lift, TKE is observed not only to increase, but change the spatial distribution of turbulence. Of course, the reduction in valve lift comes with the penalty of a reduced valve curtain area. However, it was identified both in literature and throughout this study that the reduction in lift did not negatively influence the engine breathing as the same trapped mass was achieved under all cases with no adjustment of manifold pressure. While literature shows both bulk motion and turbulence are key in <b>liquid</b> fuel <b>break-up</b> during the intake stroke, the mixing effects under port-injected natural gas were investigated experimentally using Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF). The valve strategy was found to have no significant effect on the mixture distribution at the time of spark...|$|R
