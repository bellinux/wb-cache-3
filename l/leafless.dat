5|$|Areoles are {{structures}} {{unique to}} cacti. Although variable, they typically appear as woolly or hairy {{areas on the}} stems from which spines emerge. Flowers are also produced from areoles. In the genus Pereskia, believed similar to the ancestor of all cacti, the areoles occur in the axils of leaves (i.e. in the angle between the leaf stalk and the stem). In <b>leafless</b> cacti, areoles are often borne on raised areas on the stem where leaf bases would have been.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships and}} heredity {{of a group}} of organisms is called its phylogeny. Phylogenetic studies attempt to discover phylogenies. The basic approach is to use similarities based on shared inheritance to determine relationships. As an example, species of Pereskia are trees or bushes with prominent leaves. They do not obviously resemble a typical <b>leafless</b> cactus such as an Echinocactus. However, both Pereskia and Echinocactus have spines produced from areoles (highly specialised pad-like structures) suggesting that the two genera are indeed related.|$|E
5|$|The single <b>leafless</b> stem or scape, {{appearing}} {{from early}} to late spring {{depending on the}} species, bears from 1 to 20 blooms. Stem shape depends on the species, some are highly compressed with a visible seam, while others are rounded. The stems are upright and located at {{the centre of the}} leaves. In a few species such as hN. hedraeanthus the stem is oblique (asymmetrical). The stem is hollow in the upper portion but towards the bulb is more solid and filled with a spongy material.|$|E
5|$|Deciduous {{trees and}} {{plants have been}} {{promoted}} {{as a means of}} controlling solar heating and cooling. When planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere, their leaves provide shade during the summer, while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter. Since bare, <b>leafless</b> trees shade 1/3 to 1/2 of incident solar radiation, there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating. In climates with significant heating loads, deciduous trees should not be planted on the Equator-facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability. They can, however, be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter solar gain.|$|E
5|$|Judging {{relationships}} {{based on}} shared characters requires care, since plants may resemble one another through convergent evolution in which characters have arisen independently. Some euphorbias have <b>leafless,</b> rounded bodies adapted to water conservation {{similar to those}} of globular cacti, but characters such as the structure of their flowers make it clear that the two groups are not closely related. The cladistic method takes a systematic approach to characters, distinguishing between those that carry no information about shared evolutionary history – such as those evolved separately in different groups (homoplasies) or those left over from ancestors (plesiomorphies) – and derived characters, which have been passed down from innovations in a shared ancestor (apomorphies). Only derived characters, such as the spine-producing areoles of cacti, provide evidence for descent from a common ancestor. The results of cladistic analyses are expressed as cladograms: tree-like diagrams showing the pattern of evolutionary branching and descent.|$|E
5|$|The {{plants are}} scapose, having a single central <b>leafless</b> hollow flower stem (scape). Several green or blue-green, narrow, strap-shaped leaves {{arise from the}} bulb. The plant stem usually bears a solitary flower, but {{occasionally}} a cluster of flowers (umbel). The flowers, which are usually conspicuous and white or yellow, sometimes both or rarely green, consist of a perianth of three parts. Closest to the stem (proximal) is a floral tube above the ovary, then an outer ring composed of six tepals (undifferentiated sepals and petals), and a central disc to conical shaped corona. The flowers may hang down (pendent), or be erect. There are six pollen bearing stamens surrounding a central style. The ovary is inferior (below the floral parts) consisting of three chambers (trilocular). The fruit consists of a dry capsule that splits (dehisces) releasing numerous black seeds.|$|E
25|$|The scape (flowering stalk) is erect, <b>leafless,</b> terete or compressed.|$|E
25|$|The {{branches}} have an irregular, spreading and arching {{appearance that}} produce a profound <b>leafless</b> silhouette {{in the clear}} winter sky. During Autumn leaves turn a yellow to light orange color but become brown during mid to late fall. In advancing age the branches assume a drooping characteristic. Its pewter-colored rippled bark adds to the attractive aesthetic of this species.|$|E
25|$|For Banks, rhyniophytes {{comprised}} simple <b>leafless</b> {{plants with}} terminal sporangia (e.g., Cooksonia, Rhynia) with centrarch xylem; zosterophylls comprised plants with lateral sporangia that split distally (away from their attachment) to release their spores, and had exarch strands of xylem (e.g., Gosslingia). Trimerophytes comprised plants with large clusters of downwards curving terminal sporangia that split along their length to release their spores and had centrarch xylem strands (e.g., Psilophyton).|$|E
25|$|Above {{the base}} are upturned <b>leafless</b> sticks which the triffid drums against its stem. The exact {{purpose of this}} is not fully {{explained}} in The Day of the Triffids; it is originally assumed that {{they are part of}} the reproductive system, but Bill Masen's colleague Walter Lucknor believes that they are employed for communication. It is revealed that removal of these sticks causes the triffid to physically deteriorate. In The Night of the Triffids, the character Gabriel Deeds speculates that the vibrations made by the triffid's sticks serve as a form of echolocation.|$|E
25|$|Maurice's general Priscus {{began to}} hinder the Slavs {{crossing}} the Danube in spring 593. He routed them {{several times before}} crossing the Danube {{to carry on the}} fight in the uncharted swamps and forests of modern-day Greater Wallachia until autumn. Then, he disobeyed Maurice's order to spend the winter on the northern Danube bank, among frozen swamps and rivers and <b>leafless</b> forests. Instead, Priscus retired to winter quarters in Odessos (modern Varna). This led to a new Slav incursion 593/594 in Moesia and Macedonia, during which the towns of Aquis, Scupi and Zaldapa in Dobruja were destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The lake is {{bordered on}} two sides by wetland podocarp forest. The wetland forest is {{dominated}} by kahikatea, pukatea, and swamp maire, with substantial amounts of kie kie in the understorey. The drier forest on the higher surrounding terraces is largely tawa, kohekohe, and māhoe, with some rimu and titoki. The rare <b>leafless</b> mistletoe Korthalsella salicornioides {{is found in the}} manuka forest on the fringes. Papaitonga Scenic Reserve is scientifically important, as it contains the last remaining sequence of wetland forest grading into dry terrace forest in the Wellington and Horowhenua area. The southwest to northwest shores are pasture and largely bare of trees.|$|E
25|$|St James Park, {{most likely}} named after its road frontage, is {{predominantly}} used for croquet, cricket and soccer. It {{is probably one}} of the most beautiful parks in the city with tree lined walkways and gardens. The park in the heart of Papanui is probably the best location to see over-wintering monarch butterflies. On a warm sunny late autumn or early winter's day head to the children's play ground and look into the largely <b>leafless</b> old trees. There you will see monarchs clustering together often holding on to the remaining leaves for support. It ís a great spot for a picnic beneath the trees with monarchs fluttering in the air above.|$|E
25|$|Members of {{the genus}} are small {{perennial}} or annual herbs that reside in oases of deep white sand surrounded by the typical vegetation of the cerrado ecoregion. They {{are no more than}} 26cm tall with 5-10 leaves. Zigzag-shaped racemes are produced from upright stems and account for the height of the species. These monotelic inflorescences are <b>leafless</b> and produce pale blue to lilac flowers (P. goiasensis has a yellow corolla tube). The flowers possess monothecous, glabrous anthers, which are unusual in the family. The upper surface of the leaves are covered with stalked capitate glands that are also seen in many carnivorous plant genera.|$|E
25|$|If the {{cladogram}} {{above is}} correct it {{has implications for}} the evolution of land plants. The earliest diverging polysporangiophytes in the cladogram are the Horneophytopsida, a clade at the 'protracheophyte' grade that is sister to all other polysporangiophytes. They had essentially an isomorphic alternation of generations (meaning that the sporophytes and gametophytes were equally free living), which might suggest that both the gametophyte-dominant life style of bryophytes and the sporophyte-dominant life style of vascular plants evolved from this isomorphic condition. They were <b>leafless</b> and did not have true vascular tissues. In particular, they did not have tracheids: elongated cells that help transport water and mineral salts, and that develop a thick lignified wall at maturity that provides mechanical strength. Unlike plants at the bryophyte grade, their sporophytes were branched.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the leaf}} {{primordial}} cells are established from the SAM cells, the new axes for leaf growth are defined, one important (and more studied) among them being the abaxial-adaxial (lower-upper surface) axes. The genes involved in defining this, {{and the other}} axes {{seem to be more}} or less conserved among higher plants. Proteins of the HD-ZIPIII family have been implicated in defining the adaxial identity. These proteins deviate some cells in the leaf primordium from the default abaxial state, and make them adaxial. It is believed that in early plants with leaves, the leaves just had one type of surface - the abaxial one. This is the underside of today's leaves. The definition of the adaxial identity occurred some 200 million years after the abaxial identity was established. One can thus imagine the early leaves as an intermediate stage in evolution of today's leaves, having just arisen from spiny stem-like outgrowths of their <b>leafless</b> ancestors, covered with stomata all over, and not optimized as much for light harvesting.|$|E
25|$|Since most {{conifers}} are evergreens, {{the leaves}} of many conifers are long, thin and have a needle-like appearance, but others, including most of the Cupressaceae {{and some of the}} Podocarpaceae, have flat, triangular scale-like leaves. Some, notably Agathis in Araucariaceae and Nageia in Podocarpaceae, have broad, flat strap-shaped leaves. Others such as Araucaria columnaris have leaves that are awl-shaped. In the majority of conifers, the leaves are arranged spirally, exceptions being most of Cupressaceae and one genus in Podocarpaceae, where they are arranged in decussate opposite pairs or whorls of 3 (-4). In many species with spirally arranged leaves, such as Abies grandis (pictured), the leaf bases are twisted to present the leaves in a very flat plane for maximum light capture. Leaf size varies from 2mm in many scale-leaved species, up to 400mm long in the needles of some pines (e.g. Apache Pine, Pinus engelmannii). The stomata are in lines or patches on the leaves, and can be closed when it is very dry or cold. The leaves are often dark green in colour, which may help absorb a maximum of energy from weak sunshine at high latitudes or under forest canopy shade. Conifers from hotter areas with high sunlight levels (e.g. Turkish Pine Pinus brutia) often have yellower-green leaves, while others (e.g. blue spruce, Picea pungens) have a very strong glaucous wax bloom to reflect ultraviolet light. In the great majority of genera the leaves are evergreen, usually remaining on the plant for several (2-40) years before falling, but five genera (Larix, Pseudolarix, Glyptostrobus, Metasequoia and Taxodium) are deciduous, shedding the leaves in autumn and <b>leafless</b> through the winter. The seedlings of many conifers, including most of the Cupressaceae, and Pinus in Pinaceae, have a distinct juvenile foliage period where the leaves are different, often markedly so, from the typical adult leaves.|$|E
500|$|Plants of Buxbaumia {{have a much}} reduced gametophyte, {{bearing a}} {{sporophyte}} that is enormous by comparison. [...] In most mosses, the gametophyte stage {{of the life cycle}} is both green and leafy, and is substantially larger than the spore-producing stage. [...] Unlike these other mosses, the gametophyte of Buxbaumia is microscopic, colorless, stemless, and nearly <b>leafless.</b> [...] It consists exclusively of thread-like protonemata for most of its existence, resembling a thin green-black felt on the surface where it grows. [...] The plants are dioicous, with separate plants producing the male and female organs. [...] Male plants develop only one microscopic leaf around each antheridium, and female plants produce just three or four tiny colorless leaves around each archegonium.|$|E
500|$|B. rupestris is deciduous. Trees {{in their}} native habitat are {{typically}} <b>leafless</b> between September and December; the timing, duration and extent of leaf drop may be affected by extremes of rainfall or drought. Sometimes trees shed leaves from only some branches. On every tree, the leaves vary in shape, ranging from narrow and elliptic to deeply divided. The upper surface is glossy, contrasting with a pale undersurface. The adult leaf blades are [...] long and [...] wide with pointed ( [...] or [...] ) tips. They have a raised [...] on {{the upper and lower}} surface, with 12–25 pairs of lateral veins that are more prominent on the upper surface, arising at 50–60 degrees from the midrib.

500|$|By {{studying}} {{the ratio of}} 14C to 13C incorporated into a plant—its isotopic signature—it is possible to deduce how much [...] is taken up at night and how much in the daytime. Using this approach, most of the Pereskia species investigated exhibit some degree of CAM-cycling, suggesting this ability was present in the ancestor of all cacti. Pereskia leaves are claimed to only have the [...] C3 mechanism with CAM restricted to stems. More recent studies show that [...] "it {{is highly unlikely that}} significant carbon assimilation occurs in the stem"; Pereskia species are described as having [...] "C3 with inducible CAM." [...] <b>Leafless</b> cacti carry out all their photosynthesis in the stem, using full CAM. , {{it is not clear whether}} stem-based CAM evolved once only in the core cacti, or separately in the opuntias and cactoids; CAM is known to have evolved convergently many times.|$|E
500|$|The <b>leafless,</b> spiny stem is the {{characteristic}} {{feature of the}} majority of cacti (and all of those belonging to the largest subfamily, the Cactoideae). The stem is typically succulent, meaning it is adapted to store water. The surface of the stem may be smooth (as in some species of Opuntia) or covered with protuberances of various kinds, which are usually called tubercles. These vary from small [...] "bumps" [...] to prominent, nipple-like shapes in the genus Mammillaria and outgrowths almost like leaves in Ariocarpus species. The stem may also be ribbed or fluted in shape. The prominence of these ribs depends on how much water the stem is storing: when full (up to 90% of the mass of a cactus may be water), the ribs may be almost invisible on the swollen stem, whereas when the cactus is short of water and the stems shrink, the ribs may be very visible.|$|E
500|$|In the wild, {{the species}} of Schlumbergera grow either on trees (epiphytic) or on rocks (epilithic) and can form {{sizeable}} shrubs with woody bases; {{a height of}} up to [...] has been reported for one species (S. opuntioides). They are <b>leafless,</b> the green stems acting as photosynthetic organs. The stems are composed of segments, which take one of two forms. In most species the segments are strongly flattened (cladodes), being {{made up of a}} central core with two (or more rarely three) [...] "wings". Special structures characteristic of cacti, called [...] "areoles", then occur at the ends of the segments of the stem. In two species the stems are less flattened, more cylinder-shaped, and the areoles are arranged in a more or less spiral pattern all over the segments. In both cases, the areoles, which may have wool and bristles, are where the flower buds appear.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the before the evolution of leaves, plants had the photosynthetic apparatus on the stems. Today's megaphyll leaves probably became commonplace some 360 , about 40 my after the simple <b>leafless</b> plants had colonized the land in the early Devonian period.

2500|$|As {{noted in}} 1913 by Luceafărul art {{columnist}} G. Duma, Sion took his painting [...] "science" [...] from French academies and [...] "the grand masters", techniques from Synthetism in his religious work, and modern decorative elements in his landscapes. Duma describes Sion's 1913 paintings, especially Crai nou ("New Moon") and the Crucifixion, {{as a spiritual}} journey, and concludes: [...] "In vibrant colors, with well-ordered planes, always directing us {{to the art of}} the future, the conscious painter Theodorescu-Sion dreams of and puts into song that aria which leads to immortality." [...] Art historians have since disagreed about young Sion's focus on the existential mystery. Mariana Vida calls his early compositions [...] "pathetically Symbolist", but, according to Amelia Pavel, his visions of solitary trees fuse Art Nouveau, [...] "with its twisted lineaments", with elements taken out of Expressionism. She writes: [...] "the <b>leafless</b> tree [...] a symbol of human alienation, of human powerlessness when faced with the immensity of nature". Pavel is explicitly contradicted by fellow Romanian scholar Dan Grigorescu: [...] "the tree motif is probably closer to [...] decorative-muralist vision of a hallmark monumentality, with its ethnicist implications".|$|E
2500|$|The {{book was}} written between 1959 and 1960. L'Engle wrote {{repeatedly}} about {{the writing of}} the story and the long struggle to get it published. In A Circle of Quiet (1972), she explains that the book was conceived [...] "during a time of transition." [...] After years of living in rural Goshen, Connecticut and running a general store, L'Engle's family, the Franklins, moved back to New York City, first taking a ten-week camping trip across the country and back again. L'Engle writes that [...] "we drove through a world of deserts and buttes and <b>leafless</b> mountains, wholly new and alien to me. And suddenly into my mind came the names, MrsWhatsit. MrsWho. MrsWhich." [...] This was in the spring of 1959. L'Engle was reading about quantum physics at the time, which also made its way into the story. When she completed the book in early 1960, however, it was rejected by at least 26publishers, because it was, in L'Engle's words, [...] "too different," [...] and [...] "because it deals overtly with the problem of evil, and it was really difficult for children, and was it a children's or an adults' book, anyhow?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Hilde {{sees the}} lifeless and <b>leafless</b> pear {{tree in the}} village. She refers {{to it as the}} [...] "February Tree", the tree on which Hannes was hanged.

2500|$|Many Early Devonian plants did {{not have}} true roots or leaves like extant plants and {{vascular}} tissue {{has yet to be}} observed in many of those plants. Some of the early land plants such as Drepanophycus likely spread by vegetative growth and primitive spores. The earliest land plants such as Cooksonia consisted of <b>leafless,</b> dichotomous axes and terminal sporangia and were generally very short-statured, and grew hardly more than a few centimeters tall. By far the largest land organism during this period was the enigmatic Prototaxites, which was possibly the fruiting body of an enormous fungus, rolled liverwort mat, or another organism of uncertain affinities that stood more than 8 meters tall, and towered over the low, carpet-like vegetation. By the Middle Devonian, shrub-like forests of primitive plants existed: lycophytes, horsetails, ferns, and progymnosperms had evolved. Most of these plants had true roots and leaves, and many were quite tall. The earliest known trees, from the genus Wattieza, appeared in the Late Devonian around 385 Mya. In the Late Devonian, the tree-like ancestral Progymnosperm Archaeopteris which had conifer-like true wood and fern-like foliage and the cladoxylopsids grew. (See also: lignin.) These are the oldest known trees of the world's first forests. By the end of the Devonian, the first seed-forming plants had appeared. This rapid appearance of so many plant groups and growth forms has been called the [...] "Devonian Explosion".|$|E
2500|$|As noted earlier, Samhain {{was seen}} as a liminal time, when the {{boundary}} between this world and the Otherworld could more easily be crossed. This meant the aos sí, the 'spirits' or 'fairies', could more easily come into our world. Many scholars see the aos sí as remnants of the pagan gods and nature spirits. At Samhain, it was believed that the aos sí needed to be propitiated to ensure that the people and their livestock survived the winter. As such, offerings of food and drink would be left outside for the aos sí. Portions of the crops might also be left in the ground for them. One custom—described a [...] "blatant example" [...] of a [...] "pagan rite surviving into the Christian epoch"—was observed in the Outer Hebrides until the early 19th century. On 31 October, the locals would go down to the shore. One man would wade into the water up to his waist, where he would pour out a cup of ale and ask 'Seonaidh' ('Shoney'), whom he called [...] "god of the sea", to bestow blessings on them. People also took special care not to offend the aos sí and sought to ward-off any who were out to cause mischief. They stayed near to home or, if forced to walk in the darkness, turned their clothing inside-out or carried iron or salt to keep them at bay. The dead were also honored at Samhain. The beginning of winter may have been seen as the most fitting time to do so, as {{it was a time of}} 'dying' in nature. The souls of the dead were thought to revisit their homes seeking hospitality. Places were set at the dinner table and by the fire to welcome them. The belief that the souls of the dead return home on one night of the year and must be appeased seems to have ancient origins and is found in many cultures throughout the world. James Frazer suggests [...] "It was perhaps a natural thought that the approach of winter should drive the poor, shivering, hungry ghosts from the bare fields and the <b>leafless</b> woodlands to the shelter of the cottage". However, the souls of thankful kin could return to bestow blessings just as easily as that of a wronged person could return to wreak revenge.|$|E
