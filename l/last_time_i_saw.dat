The fourth reviewer, Hope Chapman, expressed immediate dislike towards the series, criticizing it for lacking anything to engage the viewers and for being a lazy adaptation of a light novel, and concluding the review with [...] "I can't even remember the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> something with not a single redeeming factor or thing to recommend about it at all."

New York Press critic Armond White called the film [...] "a genuine pop classic", and praised Hardwicke for turning [...] "Meyer's book series into a Brontë-esque vision." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, [...] "I saw it at a sneak preview. <b>Last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> a movie in that same theater, the audience welcomed it as an opportunity to catch up on gossip, texting, and laughing at private jokes.

All the story's inherent silliness aside, it is intent on conveying the magic of meeting that one special person you've been waiting for. Maybe it is possible to be 13 and female for a few hours after all". USA Today gave the film two out of four stars and Claudia Puig wrote, [...] "Meyer {{is said to have been}} involved in the production of Twilight, but her novel was substantially more absorbing than the unintentionally funny and quickly forgettable film". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B" [...] rating and Owen Gleiberman praised Hardwicke's direction: [...] "She has reconjured Meyer's novel as a cloudburst mood piece filled with stormy skies, rippling hormones, and understated visual effects".|$|E

Then the 3rd Battalion prepared to assault Tanambogo. The Marines on Gavutu provided covering fire for the attack. In preparation for the assault, U.S. carrier-based dive bombers and naval gunfire bombardment were requested. After the carrier aircraft twice accidentally dropped bombs on the U.S. Marines on Gavutu, killing four of them, further carrier aircraft support was canceled. San Juan, however, placed its shells on the correct island and shelled Tanambogo for 30 minutes.

5000|$|The {{production}} of the film also signaled {{a change in the}} graphic style of Disney's animation. Sleeping Beauty had a more graphic, angular style than previous Disney films, and Dalmatians had an even more stylized look, inspired by British cartoonist Ronald Searle, which would become the norm for Disney animation for years to come. For the movie art director Ken Anderson and color stylist Walter Peregoy worked out a new way of painting backgrounds by leaving out the usual linework. The linework was instead printed on a separate animation cel before being laid over the background. This gave it an appearance similar to the Xeroxed animation. Disney disliked the artistic look of the film and felt he was losing the fantasy element of his animated films. Ken Anderson took this to heart, but Walt eventually forgave him on his final trip to the studio in late 1966. As Anderson recalled in an interview:He looked very sick, I said [...] "Gee it's great to see you Walt", and he said [...] "You know that thing you did on dalmatians".
