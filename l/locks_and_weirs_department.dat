5|$|Kelston <b>Lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> have {{permanent}} moorings {{above and}} below them. The Riverside Inn and Saltford Marina are also close by. Saltford <b>Lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> are overlooked by {{the remains of the}} Kelston Brass Mill, which was working until 1925. It is a grade II listed building. Alongside the lock is a pub, whose garden extends over the lock to the small island between the <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir.</b> The <b>lock</b> was opened in 1727 and destroyed in 1738 by rival coal dealers to stop the use of the river for transportation. In its heyday, between 1709 and 1859 Swineford had an active brass and copper industry around the Swineford Lock which were served by the river which also provided water power for the cloth industry, as did the River Boyd, a tributary which flows into the Avon near Bitton. Keynsham Lock opened in 1727. Just above the lock are some visitor moorings and a pub, on an island between the <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> the <b>weir.</b> The weir side of the island is also the mouth of the River Chew. Hanham is the last tidal lock, after which the river is joined by Brislington Brook.|$|R
50|$|Marlow Lock is a <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> {{situated}} on the River Thames {{in the town of}} Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England. The first pound lock was built by the Thames Navigation Commission in 1773.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> are {{overlooked}} by {{the remains of}} the Kelston Brass Mill, which was working until 1925. It is a grade II listed building. Alongside the lock is the Jolly Sailor pub, whose garden extends over the lock to the small island between the <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir.</b> The <b>lock</b> was opened in 1727 and destroyed in 1738 (probably by rival coal dealers) to stop the use of the river for transportation. The pub was built in 1726 for the bargees, when the navigation opened. The wooden fireplace has holes made by hot pokers which newly promoted captains of the barges.|$|R
50|$|Mapledurham Lock is a <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> {{situated}} on the River Thames in England. The lock was first built in 1777 by the Thames Navigation Commissioners <b>and</b> the present <b>lock</b> dates from 1908.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> {{are easily}} reached {{by a short}} {{footpath}} from the free car park, {{which is at the}} end of Hurley High Street in the village of Hurley on the south bank of the river.|$|R
50|$|The <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs,</b> in effect, {{break the}} river up into 44 lakes or lock reaches. Each lock {{controls}} the reach above it and thus identifies it. Each reach {{has its own}} character and points of interest.|$|R
50|$|Otto Wagner was tasked by the Kommission für Verkehrsanlagen (Commission for Transport Facilities) in December 1896 {{with the}} design of the quays. In line with his plans, the 15-metre wide quays were built with sites for a fish market, a berth for {{passenger}} ships and loading bays for freight. Wager also designed the Nußdorf <b>and</b> Kaiserbadwehr <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs</b> <b>and</b> the attached houses.|$|R
50|$|Hurley Lock is a <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> on the River Thames in England, {{situated}} in a clump of wooded islands close {{to the village of}} Hurley, Berkshire. The lock was first built by the Thames Navigation Commissioners in 1773.|$|R
50|$|Each of the Environment Agency's <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs</b> is {{manned by}} a lock keeper, who {{normally}} {{lives in a}} house adjacent to the lock. The lock keeper's duties involve both operating the <b>lock,</b> <b>and</b> managing the river levels above the lock by adjusting the weir openings.|$|R
25|$|Boulter's <b>Lock</b> – <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> on the Thames River in England. A canoe/kayak flume is {{installed}} annually on the weir {{during the summer}} and there is a permanent fixed ramp in front of the third of the weir's six gates.|$|R
50|$|Temple Lock is a <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> {{situated}} on the Buckinghamshire bank of the River Thames near Temple Mill Island opposite Temple Meadows and not far from Hurley, Berkshire. It was first built by the Thames Navigation Commissioners in 1773.|$|R
2500|$|Improvements to aid {{navigation}} {{began in}} 1635, {{and a series}} of <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs</b> made it possible to reach Stratford, and to within [...] of Warwick. The Upper Avon was tortuous and prone to flooding, and was abandoned as a means of navigation in 1877. The Lower Avon struggled on, and never really closed, although it was only navigable below Pershore by 1945. Restoration of the lower river as a navigable waterway began in 1950, and was completed in 1962. The upper river was a more daunting task, as most of the <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs</b> were no longer extant. Work began in 1965 on the construction of nine new <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> [...] of river, using mainly volunteer labour, and was completed in 1974 when it was opened by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother.|$|R
50|$|A <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> now {{exist on}} the Lee Navigation near where the ford used to be. This lies {{at the end of}} 'Hackney Cut', an 18th-century {{artificial}} channel and the natural channel (known as the Waterworks River) rejoins the channel below the lock.|$|R
50|$|Whitchurch Lock is a <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> {{situated}} on the River Thames in England. It is a pound lock, built by the Thames Navigation Commissioners in 1787. It is on an island near the Oxfordshire village of Whitchurch-on-Thames and is inaccessible except by boat.|$|R
25|$|Penton Hook Island is a mainly wooded former peninsular created into {{a series}} of three weir-divided islands in the River Thames in England in river {{modifications}} since 1815. It has the <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs</b> that are the divide between the Laleham Reach, above Chertsey <b>Lock</b> <b>and</b> Staines Reach, above Penton Hook Lock.|$|R
50|$|Bray Lock is a <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> on the River Thames in England near Bray and Dorney Reach, and is {{just above}} the M4 Bridge across the Thames. The lock is on the Buckinghamshire {{side of the river}} on the {{opposite}} bank from Bray itself and Maidenhead which are in Berkshire. Here, the county line stands roughly halfway between the <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> the opposite bank, following the course of the Thames itself. The pound lock was built by the Thames Navigation Commission relatively late in 1845 The lock keeper's cottage is on an island (Parting Eyot) between the <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> the <b>weir.</b>|$|R
50|$|After {{significant}} {{drought and}} low water flows in the Murray River around 2009-2010, the flood plains were under significant stress {{due to lack}} of water. As a response to this, additional regulators were installed to enable artificial floods across parts of the wetland to ensure the health of the trees by simulating the natural floods that would have occurred before the river was regulated by the <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs</b> <b>and</b> upstream dams.|$|R
5000|$|There was {{previously}} a weir {{on the site}} known as Clarke's, although the names Becks or Bucks were also used. It was removed in 1868 and the river was widened then. Proposals for the new pound <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> were raised in 1891 and implemented the following year.|$|R
5000|$|This {{bridge was}} {{replaced}} by a more sturdy eleven-arch wooden bridge in 1778. By 1840 this bridge had become dilapidated and the owner appealed to the Corporation of London to support reconstruction. Among their arguments were that since the bridge was built, the City had created Molesey <b>Lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>Weir</b> <b>and</b> as a consequence navigation through the bridge was dangerous. The bridge was described at about this time as [...] "crazy, hog-backed, inconvenient and obstructive of the navigation".|$|R
50|$|Shiplake Lock is a <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> {{situated}} on the River Thames in England {{near the village of}} Shiplake, Oxfordshire. It is just above the points where the River Loddon joins the Thames and Shiplake Railway Bridge crosses the river. The first pound lock was built by the Thames Navigation Commission in 1773.|$|R
500|$|Progress was slow, as only Richard Vernon of the {{original}} three undertakers was actively engaged on the project, {{and he could not}} reach agreement with the Commissioners. The stalemate was broken when Vernon died in 1726, and new undertakers were appointed. The work on the Weaver was completed by 1732, at a cost of £15,885. Eleven timber <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs</b> had been constructed, but no work had been carried out on the Witton Brook. The river had been improved by dredging and the construction of a series of cuts, with <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs</b> to manage the drop of around [...] over the [...] between Winsford and the River Mersey. Barges of up to 40 tons could reach Winsford, and boats called Weaver flats were the predominant vessels. These either sailed up the river, or were bow-hauled by teams of men.|$|R
50|$|Marsh Lock is a <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> {{situated}} on the River Thames in England near Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. The lock {{is close to the}} Berkshire bank, but accessed from the Oxfordshire side via two long walkways, the downstream one being near Mill Meadows. The first pound lock was built by the Thames Navigation Commission in 1773.|$|R
50|$|Old Ford Lock is a paired <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> on the River Lee Navigation, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, England. It is at Bow on {{the east}} side of London. The area, Old Ford is named after the natural ford which used to exist in the area {{crossing}} the uncanalised River Lea.|$|R
5000|$|Goring Lock is a <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> {{situated}} on the River Thames in England at the Goring Gap in the Chiltern Hills. The lock {{is located on the}} Oxfordshire bank at Goring-On-Thames, with Streatley, Berkshire {{on the opposite side of}} the river. It is just upstream of Goring and Streatley Bridge. The lock was first built in 1787 by the Thames Navigation Commissioners ...|$|R
5000|$|The lock {{was built}} in 1896 by the Thames Conservancy to replace a flash lock at Hart's Weir, also known as Ridge's Weir, about a mile {{upstream}} and another at Ark Weir downstream. The <b>lock</b> house, <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> are relatively little changed since they were built {{and they can be}} viewed as a group from the Thames Path and from the river ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the city}} centre of Bath it passes under various bridges {{including}} the Midland Bridge which was originally {{built by the}} Midland Railway Company to allow the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway access to and from its Green Park Terminus Station. In November 2011 the navigation between Bath and Bristol was closed because of safety concerns about Victoria Bridge. Weston Lock {{on the outskirts of}} Bath is in what now forms the Newbridge. Weston Cut is a man made channel, opened in 1727, for boats to approach and pass through Weston Lock, which created an island between the cut <b>and</b> the river <b>weir,</b> which became known as Dutch Island after the owner of the brass mill established on the riverside in the early 18th century.Kelston <b>Lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> have permanent moorings above and below them. The Riverside Inn and Saltford Marina are also close by. Saltford <b>Lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> are overlooked by the remains of the Kelston Brass Mill, which was working until 1925. It is a grade II listed building. Alongside the lock is a pub, whose garden extends over the lock to the small island between the <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir.</b> The <b>lock</b> was opened in 1727 and destroyed in 1738 by rival coal dealers to stop the use of the river for transportation. In its heyday, between 1709 and 1859 Swineford had an active brass and copper industry around the Swineford Lock which were served by the river which also provided water power for the cloth industry, as did the River Boyd, a tributary which flows into the Avon near Bitton. Keynsham Lock opened in 1727. Just above the lock are some visitor moorings and a pub, on an island between the <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> the <b>weir.</b> The weir side of the island is also the mouth of the River Chew. Hanham is the last tidal lock, after which the river is joined by Brislington Brook.|$|R
25|$|The {{owners of}} land {{near to the}} river complained in 1722 that the new <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> <b>weirs</b> caused them to lose income because their meadows were more often flooded. In 1793 thirty five vessels were trading from Malton, {{carrying}} corn downstream to the West Riding towns and returning upstream with coal. Virtually every village and hamlet near the tidal river had its own landing place.|$|R
50|$|Mapledurham Mill {{is still}} {{functioning}} {{across the river}} from the lock, making this the only <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> combination on the Thames that supports the two functions that were originally the norm on river navigations. As both mill and navigation are now principally tourist enterprises, this no longer leads to the sort of conflicts between milling and navigation interests that were once common on the river.|$|R
50|$|Boulter's Lock is a <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> <b>weir</b> on the River Thames in England on {{the eastern}} side of Maidenhead, Berkshire. A lock was first built here by the Thames Navigation Commission in 1772. The lock is on the western side of the river between the main (A4094) Maidenhead to Cookham road and Ray Mill Island. The name is also used for the {{immediate}} surrounding area.|$|R
