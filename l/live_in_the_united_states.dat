5|$|Screening of donated blood, blood components, {{and solid}} organ donors, {{as well as}} donors of cells, tissues, and cell and tissue {{products}} for T. cruzi is mandated in all Chagas-endemic countries and has been implemented. Approximately 300,000 infected people <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> which is likely the result of immigration from Latin American countries, {{and there have been}} 23 cases acquired from kissing bugs in the United States reported between 1955 and 2014. With increased population movements, the possibility of transmission by blood transfusion became more substantial in the United States. Transfusion blood and tissue products are now actively screened in the U.S., thus addressing and minimizing this risk.|$|E

5|$|The {{timing of}} black vultures' {{breeding}} season {{varies with the}} latitude at which they <b>live.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> birds in Florida begin breeding as early as January, for example, while those in Ohio generally do not start before March. In South America, Argentinian and Chilean birds begin egg-laying as early as September, while those further north on the continent typically wait until October. Some in South America breed even later than that—black vultures in Trinidad typically do not start until November, for example, and those in Ecuador may wait until February. Pairs are formed following a courtship ritual which is performed on the ground: several males circle a female with their wings partially open as they strut and bob their heads. They sometimes perform courtship flights, diving or chasing each other over their chosen nest site.|$|E
5|$|The race, {{the sixth}} of the season, began at 3:30p.m. EST, and was {{televised}} <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> on ABC. Scott Dixon held his lead from pole position, with Will Power behind him. Justin Wilson made light {{contact with a}} wall during the first lap of the race, and pitted shortly after due to a flat right-rear tire. The team discovered additional damage to the suspension that required lengthy repairs, but {{he was able to}} return to the race. During the fifth lap, some teams reported that parts of the track were deteriorating, but it was not felt that any action needed to be taken. Three laps later, Rubens Barrichello, who had gained four places started suffering mechanical problems, which forced him to retire from the race after eleven laps. Wilson set the fastest lap of the race during the ninth lap, completing a circuit in 1 minute 12.0651 seconds. On lap 10, Ryan Hunter-Reay blocked Ryan Briscoe from passing him, drawing a warning from race director Beaux Barfield. Sébastien Bourdais, who, along with Alex Tagliani and Oriol Servia, was running his first street race of the season without a Lotus engine, had made it to seventh before suffering mechanical problems which curtailed his race after 24 laps. James Jakes, who was suffering from problems with his brakes throughout {{the early part of the}} race eventually retired on lap 36, having spent ten laps in the pits earlier trying to resolve the issue.|$|E
