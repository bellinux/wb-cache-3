5000|$|There was {{a serious}} {{hit-and-run}} case at the beach at about 4:30 pm on Sunday, 10 July 1983. A red speedboat entered the restricted swimming zone and ran down three young swimmers. The boat did not stop, and sped {{off in the direction}} of Deep Water Bay before police arrived. The crime went unsolved. One of the injured swimmers, 24-year-old Alun Chan Hon-wah, had to have his foot and part of his lower leg amputated. The police classified the case as [...] "endangering life at sea", and the marine police and Marine Department increased patrols around beaches in an effort to protect swimmers' safety. The Urban Council installed new alarm systems and <b>loud</b> <b>hailers</b> at beaches.|$|R
50|$|In April 1986 the LTTE banned rival militant {{organisation}} Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO) and {{set about}} killing its leader Sri Sabaratnam. Sabaratnam went on the run, fleeing from TELO's main base in Kalviyankadu to Neervely, then to Kopay and finally to Kondavil. The LTTE {{found out that he}} was in Kondavil and they, led by Kittu, cordoned off the area and started a house-to-house search, using <b>loud</b> <b>hailers</b> to warn local residents not to shelter Sabaratnam. On 6 May 1986 the LTTE discovered Sabaratnam in a tobacco field and Kittu shot him in the leg to prevent him escaping. Sabaratnam pleaded with Kittu for his life but Kittu shot him using a machine gun. Sabaratnam's bullet ridden body was displayed at Kondavil bus stand before being handed over to his family.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after midnight}} police cars {{equipped}} with <b>loud</b> <b>hailers</b> {{were to be}} sent out to announce an immediate curfew in Colombo city limits. The Central Telegraph Office, Colombo and other city telephone exchanges were to be put out of operation. Newspaper office buildings, Police Headquarters, the CID office and other key points were to be taken over. Armoured cars were to be stationed at certain points to ensure {{the success of the}} operation. Troops from the Panagoda Cantonment were to be prevented from reaching Colombo that night at any cost. Armoured cars and army vehicles fitted with radio equipment, were to be stationed at the two Kelani bridges, the Kirillapone Bridge and other places. Signals Corps Despatch riders, fully armed on motorcycles, were standing by from about 11pm at Torrington (Independence) Square to storm Radio Ceylon once the password 'Holdfast' was given. A special direct telephone line had been laid the previous day, from Army Headquarters at Lower Lake Road to the Echelon Barracks, for use by army personnel. Once the corp was complete the leaders would meet at the Queen's House where they would get the Governor General Sir Oliver Goonetilleke to dissolve parliament and take direct control of the state.|$|R

5000|$|The IRA's Belfast Brigade claimed {{responsibility}} for the bombings and said that it had given warnings to the security forces before the bombs exploded. It said that the Public Protection Agency, the Samaritans and the press [...] "were informed of bomb positions at least 30 minutes to one hour before each explosion". Mac Stíofáin said that [...] "It required only one man with a <b>loud</b> <b>hailer</b> to clear each target area in no time" [...] and alleged that the warnings for the two bombs that claimed lives were deliberately ignored by the British for [...] "strategic policy reasons".|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, Miranda contributed {{music for}} the film Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015), writing a song for the scene in Maz Kanata's Cantina, an homage to the classic Mos Eisley Cantina scene and song. On January 24, 2016, Miranda {{performed}} the offstage cameo role of <b>Loud</b> <b>Hailer</b> in the Broadway production of Les Misérables, fulfilling his childhood dream {{of being in the}} show, as it was the first production he ever saw on Broadway. On March 15, 2016, members of the cast of Hamilton performed at the White House and hosted workshops; Miranda performed freestyle rap from prompts held up by President Obama. In April 2016, Miranda and Jeremy McCarter published Hamilton: The Revolution, a book describing Hamiltons journey from conception to Broadway success and discussing the cultural revolution that permeates the show.|$|E
5000|$|A megaphone, speaking-trumpet, bullhorn, or <b>loud</b> <b>hailer</b> is a portable, usually hand-held, {{cone-shaped}} {{acoustic horn}} used to amplify a person’s voice or other sounds and direct it {{in a given}} direction. The sound is introduced into the narrow end of the megaphone, by holding {{it up to the}} face and speaking into it, and the sound waves radiate out the wide end. A megaphone increases the volume of sound by increasing the acoustic impedance seen by the vocal cords, matching the impedance of the vocal cords to the air, so that more sound power is radiated. It also serves to direct the sound waves in the direction the horn is pointing. It somewhat distorts the sound of the voice because the frequency response of the megaphone is greater at higher sound frequencies.|$|E
50|$|In June 1970 a Porsche 911 Targa 'Polizei' car (509) {{fitted with}} Whizzwheels was released. It {{was based on}} a real Swiss police vehicle with its colour scheme of white and red and was fitted with a blue light on an {{extension}} next to the door and a die-cast <b>loud</b> <b>hailer</b> on the engine cover. The Fire Bug (395) appeared in December 1971, and {{was based on a}} GP Beach Buggy fitted with fire fighting equipment. British police vehicles were well represented with the Police 'Vigilant' Range Rover (461) released in January 1972 and the Ford Cortina Police Car (402) released in August of the same year. Both models were finished in the contemporary white with red/blue side stripes, which would have been familiar to many motorists at the time. The Range Rover came complete with a model policeman and emergency road signs, while the Cortina was also released with 'Polizei' labels on the otherwise unchanged British car as an export model for the German-speaking countries.|$|E
5000|$|Imminent {{collision}} alert: It may be warranted to urgently {{attempt to}} make radio contact with an approaching vessel that is running into danger or approaching a dangerous close quarters situation and therefore at risk of colliding with one's own vessel, and warning the operator to keep clear. This would be a 'bridge-to-bridge' communication and {{could be done in}} combination with sounding the [...] "your intentions are unclear or not understood" [...] sound signal, which is 5 or more short horn or whistle blasts, the 'danger signal'. A short blast is 1 second long, compared to a prolonged blast of 5 seconds duration under the COLREGS. An urgent warning could also be given over the radio, for example, if the called vessel appears to be unaware that it is potentially or at risk of endangering a person in a small boat or a person swimming, such as running the person down. A <b>loud</b> <b>hailer</b> could also be used along with a radio warning.|$|E
50|$|HMS Windsor arrived after dark, and {{was able}} to {{continue}} the embarkation. On clearing the harbour, the captain signalled that there were still British troops requiring evacuation and Vimiera was sent back, arriving in Boulogne at 1:30 a.m. The quayside was deserted but the captain called out using a <b>loud</b> <b>hailer</b> and found {{that a large number of}} men were hiding, who were packed into every available space. When Vimiera arrived at Dover at 4:00 a.m., 1,400 men disembarked. About 300 Welsh Guards were left behind, having been wrongly informed that the evacuation had ended, who then attempted a break-out to the north-east. Lanquetot had established his headquarters within the medieval walls of the Haute Ville (Old Town, the Citadel), awaiting the arrival of elements of the 21st Division. When he discovered that disaster had befallen his division, he organised the forces to defend the town as best he could. By the time that Brigadier Fox-Pitt had received orders to evacuate, there were no means of communication with Lanquetot.|$|E
50|$|He {{continued}} {{in his career}} with the Police Force becoming the Chief of Police and attending the Bramshill Police College, Hampshire. While serving in the police force, he displayed his characteristic courage and tenacity, on one occasion driving for 10 hours across the Camp to rescue a family whose house burnt down one Christmas. On another he ignored orders, diving on the wreck of an aircraft in Mare Harbour to assist in the rescue of the bodies of the occupants. Although he was awarded the Colonial Police Medal in 1975, he became dissatisfied with the police service and retired early. One of the secret duties of the Chief of Police was to collate intelligence on local political agitators, including legislative councillors, and the few Argentines living in Stanley; this was a duty he found increasingly distasteful. He was elected a member of the Legislative Council shortly afterward, where he ardently opposed any transfer of sovereignty to Argentina. In 1980, when Nicholas Ridley visited the islands to attempt to persuade the islanders to accept the leaseback proposal that the Falklands be given to Argentina, then leased back for 100 years, he fitted a <b>loud</b> <b>hailer</b> to his Land Rover with which the protestors harangued Ridley on his journey to the airport.|$|E
