500|$|To {{make the}} show more cost-effective, it was principally filmed on {{specially}} designed small sets at BBC Television Centre created by designer Tony Thorpe. The sets were de-constructed and rebuilt {{during the period}} of studio filming, as was normal for studio series then. In particular, the Queen's throne room and Blackadder's front room were featured in every episode, with only two further unique sets per episode, including an execution chamber in [...] "Head" [...] and a Spanish dungeon in [...] "Chains". Only one outside location shoot was used in the whole series, which took place before principal filming on Thursday 30 May 1985 at Wilton House, Wiltshire. These outdoor scenes were Blackadder's courting scene in [...] "Bells" [...] and the end title sequences. Studio recordings shot in front of a live audience began on Sunday 9 June 1985 with the recording of [...] "Head". Subsequent episodes were filmed on a weekly basis in the sequence [...] "Bells", [...] "Potato", [...] "Money", [...] "Beer" [...] and [...] "Chains". Director Mandie Fletcher was keen for the action to be shot spontaneously and was averse to complex costume changes or special effects which required recording to be halted. She is reputed to have said filming it was [...] "a bit <b>like</b> <b>doing</b> Shakespeare {{in front of an audience}} - it's not at all <b>like</b> <b>doing</b> sitcom." ...|$|E

Once the mission is completed, with Bond deliberately not killing the assassin, there is an attitude of complacency with Bond shrugging off his colleague's complaints about the incident. Academic Jeremy Black sees the colleague, the officious Captain Spender, as the antithesis of Bond and an echo of Colonel Schreiber, the head of security at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), who appeared in [...] "From a View to a Kill".|$|E

500|$|In a 2015 {{interview}} with The Pitchfork Review, Björk expressed frustration {{over to the}} lack of recognition for all of her work on Vespertine and her other albums. She said:I did 80% of the beats on Vespertine and it took me three years to work on that album, because it was all microbeats — it was <b>like</b> <b>doing</b> a huge embroidery piece. Matmos came {{in the last two weeks}} and added percussion on top of the songs, but they didn't do any of the main parts, and they are credited everywhere as having done the whole album. [...] Drew [...] is a close friend of mine, and in every single interview he did, he corrected it. And they don't even listen to him. It really is strange.|$|E

She found maintaining the hairstyle without McMillan's help difficult, stating [...] "I'd curse Chris every time I had to blowdry. It took three brushes—it was <b>like</b> <b>doing</b> surgery!" [...] {{and that she would}} rather shave her head than have to wear {{it for the rest of}} her life.

500|$|After a {{short time}} living with Ehnni's family, the couple {{relocated}} to Algiers. Eberhardt became disappointed with Ehnni, whose only ambition after leaving the army appeared to be finding an unskilled job {{that would allow him}} to live relatively comfortably. She increased her own efforts as a writer, and several of her short stories were printed in the local press. She accepted a job offer from Al-Akhbar (...) newspaper publisher Victor Barrucand in March 1902. Ebrhardt became a regular contributor to the newspaper; Trimardeur began appearing as a serial in August 1903. Barrucand and Eberhardt formed a friendship, though Barrucand was frequently frustrated with his new employee's work ethic. Eberhardt's articles arrived irregularly, as she would only write when she felt <b>like</b> <b>doing</b> so. Her job paid poorly, but had many benefits. Through Barrucand's contacts, Eberhardt was able to access the famous zawiya of Lalla Zaynab. Eberhardt spoke highly of her time with Zaynab, though never disclosed what the two discussed; their meeting, however, caused concern among the French authorities.|$|E

500|$|Ayola's {{first film}} {{appearance}} {{was in the}} 1993 film Great Moments in Aviation, written by Jeanette Winterson, in which she starred alongside Jonathan Pryce and John Hurt. Variety magazine's David Rooney said of her performance: [...] "In the film's most naturalistic turn, Ayola is a constant pleasure to watch. Unforced and appealing, she often succeeds in pulling the fanciful fireworks momentarily back down to Earth." [...] Ayola recalls having been daunted {{at the prospect of}} working alongside so many established names, but has deemed it to have been a [...] "wonderful experience". Her subsequent film credits are romantic comedy The Secret Laughter of Women, set in Nigeria and starring Colin Firth, thriller The i Inside, filmed in Sully Hospital, Cardiff, and starring Ryan Phillippe, and Sahara, filmed in Morocco whilst Ayola was pregnant with her first child, starring Penélope Cruz. Ayola says of her film career: [...] "I really <b>like</b> <b>doing</b> film [...] I've not done enough big films though to really know the difference between film and television." ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{finding the}} right actor to play Dimitri took such a long time, the show had already begun taping around the {{character}} for two weeks. Nader spent his first weeks on All My Children working overtime to catch up. [...] "By the time we had resolved some of the terms," [...] he said, [...] "they were really against the wall in terms of back story.... In retrospect, I should have just slept on the set because it was like sixty or seventy pages a day!" [...] Nader also taped his scenes out of sequence while dealing with sixteen different scripts from different points in the story. To keep each scene straight he gave them each a name that described the scene's main action. After those scenes were taped, they were spliced into the otherwise completed episodes. This went on for two weeks until the episodes were all caught up. Another complication Nader dealt with was the wardrobe. He said, [...] "They had devised this sort of 'tapestry' layered look for Dimitri and it was <b>like</b> <b>doing</b> scenes inside a sauna." [...] This was eventually rectified, but not before the actor lost around twelve pounds in the two weeks.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} of Unorthodox Jukebox started when Mars {{wanted to create}} something unforeseen with the follow-up of his debut album. He began not only by not allowing himself to [...] "get boxed in to any one genre" [...] during the recording sessions for the album, but also by showing the influences of several other music styles [...] "by having the autonomy and luxury of walking into the studio and claim [...] <b>like</b> <b>doing</b> a hip-hop, R, soul or rock record". Due to the music variety, the singer refused to [...] "pick a lane" [...] for Unorthodox Jukebox. As Mars {{had a lot of}} time to create the album, something that didn't happen during his debut, he reportedly had the possibility to develop a musically outstanding product that displayed his music taste and completely revealed his artistry. Because he had been a composer of pop and radio-friendly songs for a long time, it ultimately influenced the style of his debut; however, he didn't have the chance to craft the [...] "sounds and sonics" [...] he wanted to. As a result, Mars hoped to [...] "let loose" [...] and discuss darker, more risqué subject matter, while drawing on the [...] "danger" [...] embraced by pop artists such as Michael Jackson and Prince.|$|E

500|$|Kapoor's {{role in the}} Anand L. Rai-directed romantic drama Raanjhanaa (2013) {{marked a}} turning point in her career; Geety Sahgal called it her best {{performance}} to date in The Indian Express. Kapoor's role was that of Zoya Haider, a young Muslim student from Varanasi who is drawn into politics after the murder of her Sikh lover. To prepare for her part, Kapoor interacted with students, attended workshops and practiced with theatre groups associated with Jawaharlal Nehru University. She also studied Jaya Bachchan's work in Guddi (1971), which she felt was [...] "perfect" [...] for her role. Discussing her character in the film, Kapoor described her approach to acting: [...] "I have always tried to do different films and … I try to be different for every character. I <b>like</b> <b>doing</b> different things to challenge myself in every way and don't like to repeat myself." [...] Although Raanjhanaa received mixed reviews, her performance was praised; Rajeev Masand wrote that she [...] "does some of her best work here, going smoothly from innocent to manipulative to cynical, without ever losing Zoya's inherent vulnerability". With worldwide earnings of over , Raanjhanaa was a commercial success and Kapoor received her first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress.|$|E
500|$|... "Express Yourself" [...] {{has also}} {{influenced}} numerous music artists. Spice Girls member Melanie C said [...] "Madonna {{was doing the}} girl power thing {{a long time before}} the Spice Girls... 'Express Yourself' is one of the routines that I know and I used to really <b>like</b> <b>doing</b> that one because it is where she shows her bra and holds her crotch." [...] In 2010, singer Christina Aguilera paid tribute to [...] "Express Yourself" [...] with the music video of her single, [...] "Not Myself Tonight". She commented [...] "One of my favorite videos ever is 'Express Yourself' by Madonna which came across as really strong and empowering which I always try to incorporate through my expression of sexuality... I love the direct reference I made to Madonna with the eye glass moment and the smoke and stairs. I was paying tribute to a very strong woman who has paved the way before." [...] James Montgomery from MTV deemed [...] "Express Yourself" [...] as the primary influence of Aguilera's video with scenes like Aguilera displaying a monocle, standing atop a flight of stairs and crawling across the floor while pouring a black liquid over herself. Similarities were also noted between [...] "Express Yourself" [...] and singer Lady Gaga's 2011 single [...] "Born This Way" [...] both in subject matter and composition.|$|E
500|$|... "The Constant" [...] is {{the second}} Lost episode to deal {{directly}} {{with the concept of}} time travel after [...] "Flashes Before Your Eyes" [...] from the third season. [...] While promoting that episode, Lindelof said that it uses the flashback device [...] "in a way we never have before and never will again" [...] and while promoting [...] "The Constant", he said that it [...] "upholds that pledge, unpledges it, then repledges it." [...] Losts writer-producers enjoy science fiction themes such as time travel; however, they were careful not to create a paradox. [...] The rules for time-travel in the series are outlined in [...] "Flashes Before Your Eyes"—although, Lindelof has said that [...] "The Constant" [...] is a more important episode in terms of explaining time travel on the show—by Ms. Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan), who explains that certain events are inevitable and the universe will eventually correct any errors. [...] Had these rules not been established, the writers feared that viewers would lose interest because the stakes of the characters would be lessened. [...] The writers hoped that [...] "The Constant" [...] would further establish that there are no parallel universes or alternate realities. [...] Lindelof reminisced that [...] "just breaking that episode was such a massive headache" [...] and Cuse added that [...] "it was definitely <b>like</b> <b>doing</b> the hardest New York Times crossword puzzle for the week".|$|E
