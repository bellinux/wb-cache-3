40|$|To {{examine the}} {{relationships}} between the biomass of pelagic communities and to study how these relationships differ between <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> different fish assemblages, we used data on nutrients, chlorophyll, zooplankton, and fish from 96 Argentinean lakes and reservoirs. Significant differences in regressions between chlorophyll and total phosphorus, macrozooplankton and chlorophyll, and between total fish and macrozooplankton, in <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> different fish assemblages, were found. <b>Lakes</b> <b>with</b> zooplanktivorousfishes but without piscivores, and lakes without planktivores, had the highest and the lowest phytoplankton biomass, respectively. The regression line for <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> both types of fish were intermediate. Furthermore, <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> planktivores, but without piscivores, had the lowest macrozooplankton. The analysis of the trend in simple regression residuals suggests that the changes in chlorophyll, macrozooplankton, and total fish <b>with</b> <b>lake</b> trophy, are related to changes in fish assemblages...|$|R

40|$|Stocking <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> {{non-native}} trout {{to encourage}} recreational fishing causes changes in lake ecosystems that can negatively affect biodiversity. I examined associations between rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and amphibians in small lakes of British Columbia’s Southern Interior by comparing abundance, growth, and probability of presence of aquatic breeding amphibians between <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> and without trout. My {{evidence suggests that}} abundance of long-toed salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum), Columbia spotted frog (Rana luteiventris), and Pacific treefrog (Hyla regilla) larvae may be reduced by 65 % or more in <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> trout. Long-toed salamander larvae were also significantly smaller in <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> trout. In contrast, western toad (Bufo boreas) larvae {{were more likely to}} be present and more abundant in <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> trout. Managers may reduce negative impacts of introduced trout on amphibians by considering overlap between distributions of trout and amphibians and maintaining some troutless amphibian habitat across landscapes...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 The long-toed {{salamander}} (Ambystoma macrodactylum) {{is the top}} vertebrate predator in fishless high-elevation lakes in North Cascades National Park Service Complex (NOCA), Washington. The purpose {{of this research was}} {{to determine the effects of}} physico-chemical factors and introduced trout on abundance and behavior of A. macrodactylum larvae. Although high-elevation lakes in NOCA were naturally fishless, trout were stocked in many lakes during this century to provide recreational angling opportunity. Twenty fishless lakes and 25 <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> fish were sampled from 1990 to 1994. Larval salamander density and behavior were assessed by snorkeling lake perimeters and searching through nearshore substrate material and aquatic vegetation. In fishless lakes, larval salamander densities were positively related to total Kjeldahl-N concentration (TKN) and negatively related to lake elevation. Based on analysis of salamander stomach contents, crustacean zooplankton, especially cladocerans, were important food resources for larval A. macrodactylum. Total crustacean zooplankton, as well as cladoceran densities, were positively related to TKN concentration, suggesting that increased zooplankton food resources contributed to increased densities of A. macrodactylum. The effects of fish introductions on larval salamander densities depended on TKN concentration and whether or not trout had established reproducing populations. Mean larval salamander densities for fishless <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> TKN< 0. 05 mg/l, generated from a linear regression equation <b>with</b> TKN and <b>lake</b> elevation as independent variables, were not significantly different from mean larval densities in <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> either reproducing trout or in <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> non-reproducing trout. However, in fishless <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> TKN≥ 0. 05 mg/l, mean larval densities were significantly higher than in <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> reproducing fish where trout reached high densities. In fishless <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> TKN≥ 0. 095 mg/l, mean larval densities were significantly higher than in <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> non-reproducing fish where trout fry were periodically stocked at low densities. Reduced larval salamander densities in <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> trout likely was a consequence of trout predation. Although most larvae were associated with boulder, cobble, and woody debris substrates in nearshore areas of NOCA lakes, differences in the proportion of larvae hidden in benthic substrates between <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> fish and without fish were not statistically significant...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduced}} North American {{signal crayfish}} Pacifastacus leniusculus (Dana) {{has replaced the}} native noble crayfish (Astacus astacus) in many European freshwaters and {{can be considered a}} new component of these ecosystems. The 2 species are apparently similar in many respects, but their ecological equivalence is uncertain and has been little investigated, especially at the whole-lake scale. We compared the effects of the 2 species on the abundance, species richness, and composition of littoral macroinvertebrate assemblages in a set of small- and mediumsized boreal lakes, which included 8 <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> noble crayfish, 8 <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> signal crayfish, and 8 lakes without crayfish. We collected semiquantitative littoral macroinvertebrate samples with a kick net from 3 replicate sites in each lake. The abundance of invertebrates did not differ significantly among the 3 lake categories, but <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> crayfish had lower species richness than lakes without crayfish. Mollusk taxa, in particular, were fewer in <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> crayfish. Assemblage composition also differed between <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> and without crayfish. However, macroinvertebrate species richness and composition did not differ between <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> signal or noble crayfish, indicating that the 2 crayfish species are ecologically equivalent with respect to their effects on shallow, littoral invertebrate assemblages of boreal lakes...|$|R

5|$|Aronofsky {{conceived}} the premise by connecting his viewings of {{a production of}} Swan <b>Lake</b> <b>with</b> an unrealized screenplay about understudies {{and the notion of}} being haunted by a double, similar to the folklore surrounding doppelgängers. Aronofsky cites Fyodor Dostoyevsky's The Double as another inspiration for the film. The director also considered Black Swan a companion piece to his 2008 film The Wrestler, with both films involving demanding performances for different kinds of art. He and Portman first discussed the project in 2000, and after a brief attachment to Universal Studios, Black Swan was produced in New York City in 2009 by Fox Searchlight Pictures. Portman and Kunis trained in ballet for several months prior to filming, and notable figures from the ballet world helped with film production to shape the ballet presentation.|$|E

5|$|Dating back to {{the early}} days of the state highway system, M-50 was first signed in the southeastern corner of the state in 1919. During the 1920s, the highway was {{extended}} to the Grand Rapids area and beyond to Lake Michigan, making it a trans-peninsular route connecting that Great <b>Lake</b> <b>with</b> Lake Erie. A rerouting of highways including M-50 through Grand Rapids in the 1950s created Business M-50 (Bus. M-50), a business loop through that city that lasted for eight years. Additional changes made during the 1960s rerouted M-50 to replace its business loop until the highway was shortened to its present western terminus south of Lowell. A pair of truncations in Monroe in 1996 and 2006 are responsible for the present-day eastern terminus.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess AMF {{diversity}} in various plant species in <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> low and relatively high P concentrations to elucidate possible correlations with environmental factors {{in order for}} better understanding the functioning of mycorrhizal fungi in submerged plants. A considerable diversity of AMF communities was observed in the <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> low dissolved P concentrations, especially in the roots of Littorella uniflora. Glomus group A, Archaeospora and Acaulospora were the most frequent and diverse AMF lineages with eight, seven and four phylotypes at Littorella uniflora in at least six <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> low dissolved P concentrations. In theses lakes, AMF were {{for the first time}} observed in the roots of J. bulbosus, a member of a family previously thought to be non-mycorrhizal. In the <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> relatively high dissolved P concentrations, the frequency decreased from Acaulospora, found at three locations, to Archaeospora at two locations and Glomus group A and Paraglomus at one location. All chemical parameters of the surface water layer, except pH, revealed significant (p >= 0. 01) differences between the <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> low and relatively high dissolved P concentrations. Mean Mg(2 +), Ca(2 +), K(+), NH(4) (+), CO(2). o-PO(4) (3 -) and HCO(3) (-) were 3, 13. 5, 15. 7, 19. 5, 31 and 42. 6 times higher, respectively, in the <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> relatively high dissolved P concentrations compared to the <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> low dissolved P concentrations. AMF occurred more abundantly with low phosphate and high redox values in the <b>lakes</b> than <b>with</b> high phosphate and low redox values. The pH-value, the total-calcium and total-phosphorus concentrations were strongly correlated with the occurrence of Glomus phylotypes 4 and Archaeospora phylotypes 5 and 8, and a bit less with Acaulospora phylotype 4 and Archaeospora phylotype 3. In such lakes the presence of a diverse AMF community still enables the uptake of sufficient P for isoetid plant species despite the prevailing 'ultra-oligotrophic' conditions. As a consequence, macrophyte plant communities in <b>lakes</b> <b>with</b> relatively high dissolved P concentrations are less dependent on AMF colonization for their development.
