50|$|Of all the mowers, a {{properly}} adjusted cylinder mower makes the cleanest {{cut of the}} grass, and this allows the grass to heal more quickly. The cut of a well-adjusted cylinder mower is straight and definite, as if cut {{with a pair of}} scissors. This clean cut promotes healthier, thicker and more resilient lawn growth that is more resistant to disease, weeds and parasites. <b>Lawn</b> <b>cut</b> with a cylinder mower is less likely to result in yellow, white or brown discolouration as a result of leaf shredding. While the cutting action is often likened to that of scissors, it is not necessary for the blades of the spinning cylinder to contact the horizontal cutting bar. If the gap between the blades is less than the thickness of the grass, a clean cut can still be made. If more however, the grass will slip through. Reel mowers also have more difficulty mowing over uneven terrain.|$|E

40|$|Guide {{explains}} {{the different types}} of alternative fuel commercial mowers and lists the makes and models of the ones available on the market. Turf grass is a fixture of the American landscape and the American economy. It is the nation's largest irrigated crop, covering more than 40 million acres. Legions of lawnmowers care for this expanse during the growing season-up to year-round in the warmest climates. The annual economic impact of the U. S. turf grass industry has been estimated at more than $ 62 billion. Lawn mowing also contributes to the nation's petroleum consumption and pollutant emissions. Mowers consume 1. 2 billion gallons of gasoline annually, about 1 % of U. S. motor gasoline consumption. Commercial mowing accounts for about 35 % of this total and is the highest-intensity use. Large property owners and mowing companies <b>cut</b> <b>lawns,</b> sports fields, golf courses, parks, roadsides, and other grassy areas for 7 hours per day and consume 900 to 2, 000 gallons of fuel annually depending on climate and length of the growing season. In addition to gasoline, commercial mowing consumes more than 100 million gallons of diesel annually. Alternative fuel mowers are one way to reduce the energy and environmental impacts of commercial lawn mowing. They can reduce petroleum use and emissions compared with gasoline- and diesel-fueled mowers. They may also save on fuel and maintenance costs, extend mower life, reduce fuel spillage and fuel theft, and promote a 'green' image. And on ozone alert days, alternative fuel mowers may not be subject to the operational restrictions that gasoline mowers must abide by. To help inform the commercial mowing industry about product options and potential benefits, Clean Cities produced this guide to alternative fuel commercial lawn equipment. Although the guide's focus is on original equipment manufacturer (OEM) mowers, some mowers can be converted to run on alternative fuels. For more information about propane conversions. This guide may be particularly helpful for organizations that are already using alternative fuels in their vehicles and have an alternative fuel supply or electric charging in place (e. g., golf cart charging stations at most golf courses). On the flip side, experiencing the benefits of using alternative fuels in mowing equipment may encourage organizations to try them in on-road vehicles as well. Whatever the case, alternative fuel commercial lawnmowers are a powerful and cost-effective way to reduce U. S. petroleum dependence and help protect the environment...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical EngineeringThis thesis {{has three}} {{chapters}} as first chapter: UV, Visible and IR light interaction with grass-tissues, second chapter: IR light with different water absorption coefficient interaction with grass-tissues and third chapter: laser lawn mowing system. Fist chapter, we investigated how UV, Visible and IR light affectgrass tissues. Grass tissues are composed mainly of pigments and water. Chlorophyll {{plays the role}} of the photosynthesis and {{it is not only the}} green pigment but it also absorbs visible light(blue and red) well. The water content of grass tissues helps the photosynthesis with carbondioxide and it can react well with absorbed IR light. UV light canbreak the chemical bonding of materials more easily than longerwavelengths (i. e. Visible and IR regimes), since the shorter wavelengths have higher electrical potential than longer wavelengths. 355 nm (UV), 532 nm (Visible) and 1064 nm (NIR) wavelengths generated by a picosecond pulsed laser were used in the experiment. Thus, we made a process map of each wavelength and we analyzed the difference between the three wavelength regimes by using a scanning electron microscope and an optical microscope. From a process map of each wavelength, we found that the 355 nm is most effective energy transfer to grass-tissues than 532 nm and 1064 nm wavelength and 1064 nm (IR) light can reduce the damage of grass-tissues because of water absorption coefficient dominant. Therefore, we believed that chlorophyll dominant case and water dominant case have difference interaction mechanism. The chlorophyll dominant case makes directly energy of light transfer to grass-tissues then grass-tissues ablated directly. However, the water dominant case makes responses (carbonization, through-cut, partial-cut and decoloration) by heat of around absorbed area from water evaporation in grass-tissue or on surface of grass. In chapter II,Er:YAG (2. 94 μm) and CO 2 (10. 6 μm) laser interaction with grass tissues had investigated. 2. 94 μm and 10. 6 μm light, Infrared (IR) regimes, laser have high water absorption coefficient as 12000 and 860 respectively. The sample thickness (grass thickness) is around 110 μm. Since we can believe that the water content can reduce damage to grass-tissues from results previous Chapter I, the effect of water content in grass tissues had investigated in this chapter as how differently affect grass tissues as different water absorption coefficient at 2. 94 μm and 10. 6 μm wavelength cases. Plus, we investigated beam size effect and how seasonally affect grass-tissues (water concentration). Therefore, some results were found. Even though same intensity and interaction time, response is different as large beam size makes only carbonization response. 2. 94 μm with high water absorption coefficient light made faster response change than 10. 6 μmlight at using same beam size (1 mm). Chapter III, Typical <b>lawn</b> mower is <b>cut</b> the <b>lawn</b> by contact method such as rotate blade and its equipment used foil fuel engine. From these reason, typical lawn mower can make noise seriously and dangerous and some pollution. However, laser lawn mower is using non-contact method and electrical power. Thus, it can be more quite, safety and little pollution. Furthermore, from previous results Chapter I and II, developed process maps of each laser can be used to manufacturing laser lawn mowing system. In this chapter, we will introduce concept of laser lawn mowing system and suggest optical-setups to cut-well and advantage and disadvantage of each wavelengths. ope...|$|R
40|$|M. A. The {{management}} of the stormwater flow and other related environmental issues within the catchment of the Fourways Spruit have been investigated {{against the background of}} accepted management practices in other countries throughout the world. The local conditions and aspects that had an influence on the stormwater flow patterns and an impact on the environment along the Fourways Spruit have been taken into account in the study. The research problem has been divided into three main categories, namely the stormwater flow in the Fourways Spruit and the {{management of}} it, the related urban environmental problems, and the social problems related to the urban development and stormwater flow in the Spruit. Each category has been divided further into sub-categories in order to obtain indepth information on every aspect and to conduct a proper evaluation of the main problem. The existing situation as well as the problems that can be expected in the catchment was analysed in order to confirm the exact nature of the problem. Apart from the general problems associated with urbanisation and an increase in stormwater flow patterns, a number of specific problems were identified for each category. It became evident that the increase in the stormwater flow patterns in the catchment area of the Fourways Spruit was not managed in terms of accepted stormwater management practices. Certain sections of the streambed has degraded to such an extent {{as a result of the}} erosion that took place over years, that serious rehabilitation and maintenance work will be necessary in an attempt to restore the functionality of the Spruit and also to manage the stormwater flow to a certain extent. In addition, a number of new attenuation structures and measures will have to be introduced to manage the anticipated stormwater flow volumes in the future. The degrading of the stream and the natural vegetated areas along it has resulted in an accumulation of problems, also affecting the environmental and social aspects. Natural floral and faunal habitats were destroyed as a result of the erosion of the streambed and the removal of natural vegetation by replacing it with <b>cut</b> <b>lawns</b> and landscaped gardens. The large commercial component in the catchment further contributed to the environmental and aesthetic problems due to the abnormally large areas of paved surfaces resulting in the inflow of high volumes of polluted water and litter into the Fourways Spruit. The Fourways Spruit has the qualities and capabilities to function as a drainage system where the stormwater flow can be attenuated to acceptable levels. The areas along the Spruit can also function as an open space system for formal and informal recreational purposes. Suitable areas should be demarcated where the natural and safe habitats can be preserved or restored to improve the abundance and diversity of bird and animal life. A number of proposals and recommendations have been made which will improve the current condition of the Fourways Spruit. In essence, it is recommended that all the various plans, proposals, and initiatives be integrated into one workable document, namely, a Stormwater Management Plan. The recommendations and proposals regarding the necessary rehabilitation and maintenance to the streambed will improve the physical condition of the Fourways Spruit and will have in immediate positive visual impact. As the majority of problems that have been identified can be related to environmental management, the impact of the recommendations on the surrounding environment and the effectiveness of the proposed management structures and control measures will only be visible over a longer term. Should a Stormwater Management Plan, as recommended, not be prepared and implemented, it will have a serious negative impact on the Fourways Spruit, the surrounding environment, and the community living in the area...|$|R
