5|$|Many {{cities in}} Poland now have {{memorials}} to the massacre in public spaces {{as well as}} within churches and cemeteries. For example, in Wrocław, a composition by Polish sculptor Tadeusz Tchórzewski {{is dedicated to the}} Katyn victims. Unveiled in 2000, it is located in a park east of the city's centre, near the Racławice Panorama building. It shows the 'Matron of the Homeland' despairing over a dead soldier, while on a higher plinth the angel of death looms over, <b>leaning</b> <b>forward</b> on a sword.|$|E
5|$|The first event, {{the light}} plane, {{requires}} the player {{to follow a}} guide path of orbs, or to fly through rings of orbs, and then land on the runway. In the second event, skydiving, the player jumps from a helicopter at a high altitude and maneuvers by <b>leaning</b> <b>forward</b> and back, and by rotating on a horizontal axis. The player must fall through rings of orbs in the sky before deploying the parachute, and must then attempt to land in a target area made up of concentric circles, with marks indicating the points awarded. The third event sees the player taking control of a rocket belt, which can be controlled with left and right yaw rotation, <b>leaning</b> <b>forward</b> and back to control speed. High {{and low levels of}} thrust allow high speed and finer control, respectively. The player must take off and fly through a series of rings, bars, or other objects before landing in a target area. The objective of the fourth event, hang gliding, is to catch thermal currents (represented by ascending white dots), reach a specified altitude, and then land {{as close as possible to}} the center of a gray square target.|$|E
5|$|As a defence {{against the}} cold, {{a colony of}} emperor {{penguins}} forms a compact huddle (also known as the turtle formation) {{ranging in size from}} ten to several hundred birds, with each bird <b>leaning</b> <b>forward</b> on a neighbour. As the wind chill is the least severe {{in the center of the}} colony, all the juveniles are usually huddled there. Those on the outside upwind tend to shuffle slowly around the edge of the formation and add themselves to its leeward edge, producing a slow churning action, and giving each bird a turn on the inside and on the outside.|$|E

5|$|He {{scored two}} more {{victories}} on 23 and 28 April, his {{first in the}} North African Campaign. However, on 23 April, Marseille himself was shot down during his third sortie of that day by Sous-Lieutenant James Denis a Free French pilot with No. 73 Squadron RAF (8.5 victories), flying a Hawker Hurricane. Marseille's Bf 109 received almost 30 hits in the cockpit area, and three or four shattered the canopy. As Marseille was <b>leaning</b> <b>forward</b> the rounds missed him by inches. Marseille managed to crash-land his fighter. Just a month later, records show that James Denis shot down Marseille again on 21 May 1941. Marseille engaged Denis, but overshot his target. A turning dogfight ensued, in which Denis once again bested Marseille.|$|E

50|$|The IT band stabilizes {{the knee}} both in {{extension}} and in partial flexion, {{and is therefore}} used constantly during walking and running. When a person is <b>leaning</b> <b>forwards</b> with a slightly flexed knee, the tract is the knee's main support against gravity.|$|R
50|$|A self-balancing {{unicycle}} (also electric unicycle) is an self-balancing unicycle personal transporter. The rider {{controls the}} speed by <b>leaning</b> <b>forwards</b> or backwards, and steers by twisting the unit using their feet. The self-balancing mechanism uses gyroscopes, accelerometers {{in a similar}} way to that used by the Segway PT.|$|R
25|$|Wieland's minimalism {{extended}} beyond the stage furniture and props. The performer of Gunther, for example, {{was expected to}} sing <b>leaning</b> <b>forward</b> in Act 1 of Götterdämmerung until he felt his authority challenged by Hagen and sat up straight. It {{is hard to imagine}} a greater contrast with traditional operatic acting.|$|E
25|$|The head tracker {{registers}} {{the translation}} and {{rotation of the}} user's head. Pointman uses these inputs to map {{the movements of the}} user's head and torso one-for-one to those of his avatar. The virtual view changes as the user turns his head to look around or leans his torso in any direction. When the weapon is raised into an aim position its sights remain centered in the field of view, so that turning the head also adjusts the aim. The user can aim as precisely as he can hold his head on target. Hunching the head down by flexing the spine is also registered by the head's translation, and the avatar adopts a matching posture. <b>Leaning</b> <b>forward</b> and hunching are used to duck behind cover. Rising up and leaning to the side are used to look out and shoot from behind cover.|$|E
25|$|On 29 January 1889, Franz Joseph and Elisabeth gave {{a family}} dinner party prior to leaving for Buda, in Hungary, on 31 January; Rudolf excused himself, {{claiming}} to be indisposed. He had arranged for a day's shooting at Mayerling early {{on the morning of}} the 30th, but when his valet Loschek went to call him, there was no answer. Count Joseph Hoyos, the Archduke's hunting companion, joined in, with no response. They tried to force the door, but it would not give. Finally Loschek smashed in a panel with an axe to find the room shuttered and half-dark. Rudolf was found sitting (by some accounts, lying) motionless by the side of the bed, <b>leaning</b> <b>forward</b> and bleeding from the mouth. Before him on the bedside table stood a glass and a mirror. Without closer examination in the poor light, Loschek assumed that the crown prince had drunk poison from the glass, since he knew strychnine caused bleeding. On the bed lay the body of Mary Vetsera, white, ice-cold, and already quite rigid. The mistaken impression that poison was involved, and even that the baroness had poisoned the crown prince and then killed herself, would persist for some time.|$|E
5000|$|A self-balancing scooter (also [...] "hoverboard", self-balancing board) is a self-balancing {{personal}} transporter {{consisting of}} two motorised wheels connected {{to a pair of}} articulated pads on which the rider places their feet. The rider controls the speed by <b>leaning</b> <b>forwards</b> or backwards, and direction of travel by twisting the pads.|$|R

50|$|Bent over: Usually {{used for}} pegging, the man stands or kneels while <b>leaning</b> <b>forwards,</b> {{supported}} by the bed, chair, wall, or other object. Similar to doggy style, he is then penetrated from behind. This position angles the dildo such that it typically strokes firmly across his prostate, and for some men can lead to an anal orgasm much more effectively.|$|R
500|$|.....Bane {{managed to}} capture {{much of the}} ex-mayor's character: Her eyes are {{friendly}} and her hair as wild as ever. But Katz's signature grin is a little stiff, a little too aggressive. <b>Leaning</b> <b>forward,</b> she looks {{as if she might}} take a bite out of the next passerby. Which by the way, seems appropriate when you look back on her days behind the mayoral desk. Maybe monochromatic bronze just isn't the right medium for a woman as colorful as ol' Vera. Where's the red blazer? Our suggestion: Get this lady some accessories! The right hat or scarf could make that brown pantsuit really work.|$|E
500|$|At the {{professional}} level, sprinters begin the race by assuming a crouching {{position in the}} starting blocks before <b>leaning</b> <b>forward</b> and gradually moving into an upright position as the race progresses and momentum is gained. Athletes remain in the same lane on the running track throughout all sprinting events, with the sole exception of the 400m indoors. Races up to 100m are largely focused upon acceleration to an athlete's maximum speed. All sprints beyond this distance increasingly incorporate an element of endurance. Human physiology dictates that a runner's near-top speed cannot be maintained for more than thirty seconds or so because lactic acid builds up once leg muscles begin to suffer oxygen deprivation. [...] Top speed can only be maintained for up to 20metres.|$|E
500|$|The series also {{influenced}} the movie Scott Pilgrim vs. The World with director Edgar Wright {{saying he was}} inspired by how whenever there is a [...] "killer move" [...] in the manga, there is an impact in the background following any technique's usage. There is an internet meme known as [...] "Naruto run" [...] based {{on the way the}} characters run <b>leaning</b> <b>forward</b> with their arms behind their backs. In September 2017, students from the University of the Philippines Los Baños Perspective started covering publications of students running like Naruto characters. Naruto has also served as an inspiration for several other manga, including My Hero Academia and Black Clover. When the manga ended, multiple authors from the magazine expressed congratulations to Kishimoto's work.|$|E

"Yes," [...] assented Mr. Newberry, and then, <b>leaning</b> <b>forwards</b> in {{his chair}} and looking {{carefully}} about the corridors of the club, he spoke behind his hand and said, [...] "And the mayor's the biggest grafter of the lot.

500|$|Soon after {{reaching}} , the fighter's DME (radio) showed MCAS El Toro was [...] away. The pilot of '458' then performed an aileron roll, a flight maneuver that rolled the aircraft 360° {{in order to}} allow the pilot to observe any air traffic above or below the aircraft. Lt. Schiess, the Radar Intercept Officer, was operating the fighter's radar, which was unable to detect any aircraft due to its deteriorated condition. Because of the stowed position of the scope, he had been <b>leaning</b> <b>forward</b> and looking downward at the instrument. Between three and ten seconds prior to the collision, he glanced up and observed the DC-9 in his peripheral vision and shouted a warning to the pilot. The pilot attempted an evasive roll but was unable to clear the oncoming airliner.|$|E
500|$|For {{people whose}} {{injuries}} are {{high enough to}} interfere with breathing, there is great emphasis on airway clearance during this stage of recovery. Weakness of respiratory muscles impairs the ability to cough effectively, allowing secretions to accumulate within the lungs. [...] As SCI patients suffer from reduced total lung capacity and tidal volume, physical therapists teach them accessory breathing techniques (e.g. apical breathing, glossopharyngeal breathing) that typically are not taught to healthy individuals. [...] Physical therapy treatment for airway clearance may include manual percussions and vibrations, postural drainage, respiratory muscle training, and assisted cough techniques. Patients are taught to increase their intra-abdominal pressure by <b>leaning</b> <b>forward</b> to induce cough and clear mild secretions. The quad cough technique is done lying on the back with the therapist applying pressure on the abdomen in {{the rhythm of the}} cough to maximize expiratory flow and mobilize secretions. Manual abdominal compression is another technique used to increase expiratory flow which later improves coughing. Other techniques used to manage respiratory dysfunction [...] include respiratory muscle pacing, use of a constricting abdominal binder, ventilator-assisted speech, and mechanical ventilation.|$|E
500|$|His {{coaching}} brought immediate improvement. In 1897 and 1898, the Carlisle {{teams had}} 6–4 records. In 1899 (Warner's first year), Carlisle won nine and lost two games—to the country's two best teams: Harvard and Princeton. That year saw Carlisle's first major victory, {{against one of}} the [...] "Big Four" [...] teams, beating Penn 16–5. At the end of the season, the school played Columbia at the Polo Grounds in New York City, a premier sports venue at the time, defeating them 42–0. The Columbia game {{was the first time that}} a crouching start, a form of what is now known as a three point stance, was used by the running backs. Before Warner's innovation, the stance for a back before the ball was snapped was bent forward with his feet well apart and his hands on his knees. Warner realized that if his players took a stance similar to the one taken by sprinters, the legs would be bent, the back <b>leaning</b> <b>forward,</b> with one hand on the ground and the other arm cocked back to the thigh/hip region. Like with sprinters, this similar stance maximized the speed of his players. Shortly after, it became the standard football stance for both backs and linemen.|$|E

500|$|The antbirds are a {{group of}} small to {{medium-sized}} passerines that {{range in size from}} the large giant antshrike, which measures 45cm (18in) and weighs 150 g (5.29 oz), to the tiny 8-cm (3in) pygmy antwren, which weighs 7 g (0.25oz). In general terms, [...] "antshrikes" [...] are relatively large-bodied birds, [...] "antvireos" [...] are medium-sized and chunky, while [...] "antwrens" [...] include most smaller species; [...] "antbird" [...] genera can vary greatly in size. Members of this family have short rounded wings that provide good manoeuvrability when flying in dense undergrowth. The legs are large and strong, particularly in species that are obligate ant-followers. These species are well adapted to gripping vertical stems and saplings, which are more common than horizontal branches in the undergrowth, and thus the ability to grip them is an advantage for birds following swarms of army ants. The claws of these antbirds are longer than those of species that do not follow ants, and the soles of some species have projections that are tough and gripping when the foot is clenched. Tarsus length in antbirds is related to foraging strategy. Longer tarsi typically occur in genera such as the Thamnophilus antshrikes that forage by perch-gleaning (sitting and <b>leaning</b> <b>forward</b> to snatch insects from the branch), whereas shorter tarsi typically occur in those that catch prey on the wing, such as the Thamnomanes antshrikes.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{telling a story}} about a very famous Hollywood actress named Lucky. Lucky is seen wearing a pink nightgown behind the curtains, {{standing}} on her billboard with fluffy white cotton balls attached to the edges, inside her mansion and shots of her out on the balcony. As beautiful and rich as she is, on set she sits on the star-shape in the sky, as she is acting, she is looking quite distressed. After the first chorus, she goes to the hotel mansion to the flowers, then she leaves and sits down and gets a mirror. Next, Lucky opens the door to reveal a handsome man, who then takes her in his arms, as the director yells [...] "Cut! We've got it". Lucky then walks off-set into the studio, replying to the director: [...] "Finally! We've done it fifty-million times!" [...] She then goes to have her hair and makeup done; with Spears standing unnoticed and very worried looking by her side. Lucky is then seen in a shiny gray evening gown at the Academy Awards accepting her award for Best Actress. Lucky looks happy as she accepts it and smiles at her fans but is soon revealed that this is not true happiness. She makes her way away from her screaming fans and back into her limo, where she unexpectedly finds an ornate hand mirror that was used on the film set. She looks back to the crowd to see who has left it and sees Spears <b>leaning</b> <b>forward</b> in the crowd. The limo drives away, leaving Spears behind on the red carpet. The video ends with Lucky crying herself to sleep, her make-up already stained on her face. The curtains close, ending the video.|$|E
500|$|Still about [...] {{behind the}} Frenchman, Grahame-White made a {{historic}} decision; {{he would make}} an unprecedented night flight. [...] Guided by the headlamps of his party's cars, he took off at 2:50am. [...] Within minutes of becoming airborne however, he almost crashed; while he was <b>leaning</b> <b>forward</b> to make himself comfortable, his jacket brushed the engine ignition switch and he accidentally turned the engine off, but he quickly corrected his error {{and was able to}} continue. [...] Using the lights of railway stations to guide his course through the pitch black night, within 40minutes he reached Rugby, and at 3:50am he passed Nuneaton. [...] Despite making good progress, Grahame-White was carrying a large load of fuel and oil, and his engine was not powerful enough to raise the aeroplane over the high ground before him. [...] Disappointed, he landed at Polesworth, about [...] from London, and only 10miles behind Paulhan. [...] A few minutes later the Frenchman, unaware of Grahame-White's progress, resumed his journey. [...] He passed Stafford at 4:45am, Crewe at 5:20am, and at 5:32am he landed at Barcicroft Fields near Didsbury, within five miles of the Manchester office of the Daily Mail, thereby winning the contest. [...] His party was taken by train to a civic reception, held by the Lord Mayor of Manchester. [...] Grahame-White was notified of Paulhan's success, and reportedly shouted [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, the £10,000 prize has been won by Louis Paulhan, the finest aviator that the world has ever seen. [...] Compared with him I am only a novice. [...] Three cheers for Paulhan!" [...] He retired to bed, leaving his mechanics to repair his aeroplane, and later sent Paulhan a telegram, congratulating his rival on his achievement. [...] Grahame-White attempted to resume his journey to Manchester, and reached Tamworth, but he later abandoned the flight.|$|E
