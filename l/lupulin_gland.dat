Jaroslav Matoušek 1, 3 *, Tomáš Kocábek 1, Josef Patzak 2, Zoltán Füssy 1, 3, Jitka Procházková 1 and Arne Heyerick 4 Background: Lupulin glands of hop produce a specific metabolome including hop bitter acids valuable for the brewing process and prenylflavonoids with promising health-beneficial activities. The detailed {{analysis of}} the transcription factor (TF) -mediated regulation of the oligofamily of one of the key enzymes, i. e., chalcone synthase CHS_H 1 that efficiently catalyzes the production of naringenin chalcone, a direct precursor of prenylflavonoids in hop, constitutes {{an important part of the}} dissection of the biosynthetic pathways leading to the accumulation of these compounds. Results: Homologues of flavonoid-regulating TFs HlMyb 2 (M 2), HlbHLH 2 (B 2) and HlWDR 1 (W 1) from hop were cloned using a lupulin gland-specific cDNA library from the hop variety Osvald’s 72.

40|$|A hop-specific cDNA library from glandular tissue-enriched {{hop cones}} was {{screened}} for Myb transcription factors. cDNA encoding for R 2 R 3 Myb, designated HIMyb 3, was cloned and characterized. According to the amino acid (aa) sequence, HIMyb 3 shows the highest homology to GhMyb 5 from cotton and is {{unrelated to the}} previously characterized HIMyb 1 from the hop. Southern blot analyses indicated that HIMyb 3 is a unique gene, which was detected in various Humulus lupulus cultivars, but not in Humulus japonicus. Reverse transcription and real-time PCR revealed {{the highest levels of}} HIMyb 3 mRNA in hop cones at a late stage of maturation and in colored petiole epidermis, while the lowest levels were observed in hop flowers. Two alternative open reading frames starting in the N-terminal domain of HIMyb 3, encoding for proteins having 269 and 265 amino acids with apparent molecular masses of 30. 3 and 29. 9 kDa, respectively, were analyzed as transgenes that were overexpressed in Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana benthamiana, and Petunia hybrida plants. Transformation with the longer 269 aa variant designated I-HIMyb 3 led to a flowering delay and to a strong inhibition of seed germination in A. thaliana. Nearly complete flower sterility, dwarfing, and leaf curling of P. hybrida and N. benthamiana I-HIMyb 3 transgenotes were noted. On the contrary, the shorter 265 -aa-encoding s-HIMyb 3 transgene led in A. thaliana to the stimulation of initial seed germination, to fast initiation of the lateral roots, and to quite specific branching phenotypes with many long lateral stems formed at angles near 90 degrees. Limited plant sterility but growth stimulation and rather branched phenotypes were evident for s-HIMyb 3 transgenotes of P. hybrida and N. benthamiana. It was found that both HIMyb 3 transgenes interfere in the accumulation and composition of flavonol glycosides and phenolic acids in transformed plants. These effects on heterologous transgenotes suggest that the HIMyb 3 gene may influence hop morphogenesis, as well as metabolome composition during <b>lupulin</b> <b>gland</b> maturation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Bitter acids (e. g. humulone) are prenylated {{polyketides}} synthesized in <b>lupulin</b> <b>glands</b> of the hop plant (Humulus lupulus) {{which are}} important {{contributors to the}} bitter flavour and stability of beer. Bitter acids are formed from acyl-CoA precursors derived from branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) degradation and C 5 prenyl diphosphates from the methyl-D-erythritol 4 -phosphate (MEP) pathway. We used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to obtain the transcriptomes of isolated <b>lupulin</b> <b>glands,</b> cones with glands removed and leaves from high α-acid hop cultivars, and analyzed these datasets for genes involved in bitter acid biosynthesis including the supply of major precursors. We also measured the levels of BCAAs, acyl-CoA intermediates, and bitter acids in glands, cones and leaves. Results Transcripts encoding all the enzymes of BCAA metabolism were significantly more abundant in <b>lupulin</b> <b>glands,</b> indicating that BCAA biosynthesis and subsequent degradation occurs in these specialized cells. Branched-chain acyl-CoAs and bitter acids were present at higher levels in glands compared with leaves and cones. RNA-seq analysis showed the gland-specific expression of the MEP pathway, enzymes of sucrose degradation and several transcription factors that may regulate bitter acid biosynthesis in glands. Two branched-chain aminotransferase (BCAT) enzymes, HlBCAT 1 and HlBCAT 2, were abundant, with gene expression quantification by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR indicating that HlBCAT 1 was specific to glands while HlBCAT 2 was present in glands, cones and leaves. Recombinant HlBCAT 1 and HlBCAT 2 catalyzed forward (biosynthetic) and reverse (catabolic) reactions with similar kinetic parameters. HlBCAT 1 is targeted to mitochondria where it likely {{plays a role in}} BCAA catabolism. HlBCAT 2 is a plastidial enzyme likely involved in BCAA biosynthesis. Phylogenetic analysis of the hop BCATs and those from other plants showed that they group into distinct biosynthetic (plastidial) and catabolic (mitochondrial) clades.

40|$|The {{isolation}} of high-quality RNA {{is a prerequisite}} for gene expression studies. RNA quality is of special relevance if PCR-based strategies such as cDNA-AFLP or RT-PCR are followed. Our molecular investigations of hop (Humulus lupulus L.) focus on genes that determine the biosynthesis of prenylflavonoids with interesting biological activities which accumulate in the <b>lupulin</b> <b>glands.</b> However, optimized protocols for RNA extraction from hop cones are not available. In this study, the RNeasy midi kit protocol was modified to isolate high amounts of total RNA from fresh and freeze-dried hop tissues, specifically leaves, female inflorescences, and lupulin-enriched hop cone fractions. The main difficulties in obtaining high RNA yields were related to specific features of hop, including the abundance of secondary metabolites and their accumulation in the sticky <b>lupulin</b> <b>glands.</b> The introduction of a number of modifications into the RNeasy midi kit protocol resulted in RNA of high quality, as assessed by spectrophotometry and electrophoresis in agarose gels. The protocol developed is currently being used to produce cDNA-AFLP fingerprints of hop cones and leaves for genetic screening.

To dissect the biosynthetic processes occurring in <b>lupulin</b> <b>glands,</b> we sequenced 10, 581 ESTs from four trichome-derived cDNA libraries. ESTs representing enzymes of terpenoid biosynthesis, including {{all of the}} steps of the methyl 4 -erythritol phosphate pathway, were abundant in the EST data set, as were ESTs for the known type III polyketide synthases of bitter acid and xanthohumol biosynthesis. The xanthohumol biosynthetic pathway involves a key O-methylation step. Four S-adenosyl-l-methionine–dependent O-methyltransferases (OMTs) with similarity to known flavonoid-methylating enzymes were present in the EST data set. OMT 1, which was the most highly expressed OMT based on EST abundance and RT-PCR analysis, performs the final reaction in xanthohumol biosynthesis by methylating desmethylxanthohumol to form xanthohumol. OMT 2 accepted a broad range of substrates, including desmethylxanthohumol, but did not form xanthohumol. Mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance analysis showed it methylated xanthohumol to 4 -O-methylxanthohumol, which is not known from hop. OMT 3 was inactive with all substrates tested.

40|$|Hop (Humulus lupulus L.), the {{essential}} source of beer flavor {{is of interest}} from a medicinal perspective in view of its high content in health-beneficial terpenophenolics including prenylflavonoids. The dissection of biosynthetic pathway(s) of these compounds in <b>lupulin</b> <b>glands,</b> {{as well as its}} regulation by transcription factors (TFs), is important for efficient biotech no logical manipulation of the hop metabolome. TFs of the bZIP class were preselected from the hop transcriptome using a cDNA-AFLP approach and cloned from a cDNA library based on glandular tissue-enriched hop cones. The cloned TFs HlbZIP 1 A and HlbZIP 2 have predicted molecular masses of 27. 4 and 34. 2 kDa, respectively, and both are similar to the group A 3 bZIP TFs according to the composition of characteristic domains. While HlbZIP 1 A is rather neutral (pl 6. 42), HlbZIP 2 is strongly basic (pl 8, 51). A truncated variant of HlbZIP 1 (HlbZIP 1 B), which is strongly basic but lacks the leucine zipper domain, has also been cloned from hop. Similar to the previously cloned HIMyb 3 from hop, both bZIP TFs show a highly specific expression in <b>lupulin</b> <b>glands,</b> although low expression was observed also in other tissues including roots and immature pollen. Comparative functional analyses of HbZip 1 A, HlbZip 2, and subvariants of HIMyb 3 were performed in a transient expression system using Nicotiana benthamiana leaf coinfiltration with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains bearing hop TFs and selected promoters fused to the GUS reference gene. both hop bZIP TFs and HIMyb 3 mainly activated the promoters of chalcone synthase chs_H 1 and the,newly cloned O-methyl transferase 1 genes, while the response of the valerophenone synthase promoter to the cloned hop TFs was very low. These analyses also showed that the cloned bZIP TFs are not strictly G-box-specific. HPLC analysis of secondary metabolites in infiltrated Petunia hybrida showed that both hop bZIP TFs interfere with the accumulation and the composition of flavonol glycosides, phenolic acids, and anthocyanins, suggesting the possibility of coregulating flavonoid biosynthetic pathways in hop glandular tissue. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 Alpha acids {{are found}} in the <b>lupulin</b> <b>glands</b> of hops cones. These acids have no {{bitterness}} of their own, but can be isomerized and subsequently hydrogenated to form bitter iso-α-acids and tetrahydroiso-α-acids respectively. Current literature values for the detection thresholds of iso-α-acid and tetrahydroiso-α-acid in lager beer have been reported using American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) method 679, a method commonly used to find detection thresholds of various compounds. ASTM method 679 is currently described as a “rapid method” and was a forerunner to ASTM method 1432, the current standard method for finding human detection thresholds. It has been argued that ASTM method 679 is statistically weaker than ASTM method 1432, as a group threshold found using ASTM method 679 is based on an individual “best estimate threshold” found using only one ascending series of 3 -altrnative forced choice (3 -AFC) presentations per panelist. The group threshold found using ASTM method 1432 is based on individual thresholds that are determined using data from 6 ascending series of 3 -AFC presentations per panelist, the principle being that test repetition will help nullify moment-to-moment panelist variation. However, test repetition takes time, and the lack of repetition required for ASTM method 679 makes the method quicker and simpler to implement than ASTM method 1432. Current literature detection threshold values for both iso-α-acids and tetrahydroiso-α-acids in lager beer have not been found using ASTM method 1432. The primary objective of the research presented in this paper was to use the current ASTM standard method to determine updated threshold values for both iso-α-acids and tetrahydroiso-α-acids in lager beer. The secondary objective of this research was to compare threshold results from the same data set using ASTM method 679 and ASTM method 1432 to evaluate whether these methods provide statistically similar results. Findings showed that implementation of ASTM method 679 to find individual thresholds did produce results that were not statistically different from individual results found using ASTM method 1432. All group thresholds except the Day 1 tetrahydroiso-α-acid threshold found using ASTM 679 were also statistically in agreement with group thresholds obtained using ASTM method 1432. Beta acids, like alpha acids, {{are found in}} the <b>lupulin</b> <b>glands</b> of hops cones. Beta acids oxidize to form bitter compounds. Beta acids and tetrahydroiso-α-acids {{have been found to be}} miticidal against varroa mites, parasitic mites that feed off of and damage honeybees and bee larva. Though beta acids and tetrahydroiso-α-acids are FDA-declared GRAS substances, and will have no ill-effects on honey consumers, bees may transfer the bitter acids to their honey. Detectable levels of these bitter substances could lead to consumer rejection of honey from hives treated with beta acids or tetrahydroiso-α-acids. In a second experiment discussed in this thesis, the detection thresholds of beta acids and tetrahydroiso-α-acids were found in light clover honey. A method for the extraction and quantification of beta acids and tetrahydroiso-α-acids in beer and wort was modified and verified for the extraction and quantification of hops acids in honey. This method combined with group threshold data obtained in this experiment can be used in an industrial setting to determine whether the concentrations of beta acids and/or tetrahydro-iso-α-acids that may have been transferred to honey are above or below the human detection threshold...|$|R
