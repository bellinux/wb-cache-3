His <b>loyalty</b> <b>and</b> acquiescence to the German Empire was unquestioning, and he even accompanied the Germans on their escape from Africa in World War I.|$|E

5|$|Atangana's unfailing <b>loyalty</b> <b>and</b> subservience to Germany {{prevented}} the French from ever fully trusting him.

However, Atemengue never enjoyed the popularity Atangana had among the Beti. Atangana tried to secure an alliance with him by sending his 20-year-old, German-educated daughter, Katerina, to marry him, but she eventually fled from the much older Atemengue and back to her father. Atangana's work performance convinced the French to let him return to Yaoundé in late 1921 or early 1922.|$|E
