5|$|Whereas some cruise missiles, such as {{the block}} IV Tomahawk, {{have the ability to}} loiter and have some sensory and remote control features, their primary mission is {{typically}} strike and not target acquisition. Cruise missiles, as their name implies, are optimized for long-range flight at constant speed both in terms of propulsion systems and wings or <b>lifting</b> <b>body</b> design. They are often unable to loiter at slow fuel-efficient speeds which significantly reduces potential loiter time even when the missile has some loiter capabilities.|$|E
5|$|NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center {{acquired}} an F-4A on 3 December 1965. It made 55 flights {{in support of}} short programs, chase on X-15 missions and <b>lifting</b> <b>body</b> flights. The F-4 also supported a biomedical monitoring program involving 1,000 flights by NASA Flight Research Center aerospace research pilots and students of the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School flying high-performance aircraft. The pilots were instrumented to record accurate and reliable data of electrocardiogram, respiration rate and normal acceleration. In 1967, the Phantom supported a brief military-inspired program to determine whether an airplane's sonic boom could be directed and whether {{it could be used}} as a weapon of sorts, or at least an annoyance. NASA also flew an F-4C in a spanwise blowing study from 1983 to 1985, after which it was returned.|$|E
25|$|Gentry's {{most notable}} {{contributions}} to flight test occurred {{when he was}} assigned to the <b>lifting</b> <b>body</b> research program in 1965. The <b>lifting</b> <b>body</b> program, operated jointly by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Air Force, performed the initial manned tests to evaluate the feasibility of landing a wingless spacecraft on a pre-determined runway. Gentry was the eighth pilot assigned to the <b>lifting</b> <b>body</b> program and made his first air-towed flight in the NASA M2-F1 on July 16, 1965. He transitioned to the heavyweight Northrop M2-F2 <b>lifting</b> <b>body</b> which he first flew on October 12, 1966 in an unpowered mission air-dropped from a B-52 Stratofortress. By May 1967, he had made five unpowered flights in the M2-F2 to define the vehicle's aerodynamic characteristics in preparation for upcoming rocket-powered supersonic flights. M2-F2 testing ended prematurely when the vehicle crashed on May 10, 1967 severely injuring fellow <b>lifting</b> <b>body</b> test pilot, Bruce Peterson.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lifting</b> <b>bodies</b> pose complex control, structural, and {{internal}} configuration issues. <b>Lifting</b> <b>bodies</b> were eventually rejected {{in favor of}} a delta wing design for the Space Shuttle. Data acquired in flight test using high-speed landing approaches at very steep descent angles and high sink rates was used for modeling Shuttle flight and landing profiles.|$|R
50|$|Design {{principles}} of <b>lifting</b> <b>bodies</b> are used {{also in the}} construction of hybrid airships.|$|R
50|$|The three {{components}} of the design were three largely identical <b>lifting</b> <b>bodies</b> (each similar to the Northrop HL-10), stacked back-to-belly.|$|R
25|$|The Burnelli RB-1 was a US {{twin engine}} biplane {{airliner}} prototype from 1920, incorporating a <b>lifting</b> <b>body</b> fuselage.|$|E
25|$|The Directorate has {{previously}} collaborated with NASA in the X-24 project to research concepts associated with <b>lifting</b> <b>body</b> type aircraft. The X-24 {{was one of}} a series of experimental aircraft, including the M2-F1, M2-F2, HL-10, and HL-20, by NASA and Air Force programs to develop the <b>lifting</b> <b>body</b> concept into maturity. The tests conducted during these programs led to the choice of an unpowered landing for the Space Shuttle program.|$|E
25|$|While {{working on}} the <b>lifting</b> <b>body</b> program, Gentry earned a master's degree in {{aerospace}} systems management from the University of Southern California.|$|E
50|$|The XLR11-RM-13 {{was also}} used in the Dryden <b>lifting</b> <b>bodies,</b> and as a booster engine in the Republic XF-91 Thunderceptor turbojet.|$|R
50|$|Initial {{research}} into {{many types of}} fixed-wing craft, including flying wings and <b>lifting</b> <b>bodies</b> was also carried out using unpowered prototypes.|$|R
50|$|The X-24 {{was one of}} a {{group of}} <b>lifting</b> <b>bodies</b> flown by the NASA Flight Research Center (now Dryden Flight Research Center) in a joint program with the U.S. Air Force at Edwards Air Force Base in California from 1963 to 1975. The <b>lifting</b> <b>bodies</b> were used to {{demonstrate}} the ability of pilots to maneuver and safely land wingless vehicles designed to fly back to Earth from space and be landed like an airplane at a predetermined site.|$|R
25|$|Multi-Unit Space Transport And Recovery Device (MUSTARD) was a {{proposed}} launch system consisting of three reusable <b>lifting</b> <b>body</b> craft operating together.|$|E

50|$|Concepts such as <b>lifting</b> <b>bodies</b> {{attempt to}} deal with the {{somewhat}} conflicting issues of reentry, hypersonic and subsonic flight; as does the delta wing shape of the Space Shuttle.|$|R
25|$|The {{modified}} bomber flew 159 captive-carry {{and launch}} missions for the X-15 program from June 1959 until October 1968. It {{was first used}} to launch the X-15 on its fifth flight, January 23, 1960. It also flew missions for the X-24, HiMAT, <b>Lifting</b> <b>Body</b> vehicles, X-43, early launches of the OSC Pegasus rocket and numerous other programs.|$|E
25|$|The HL-20 Personnel Launch System was a circa 1990 NASA {{spaceplane}} {{concept for}} manned orbital missions studied by NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. It was envisaged as a <b>lifting</b> <b>body</b> re-entry vehicle {{similar to the}} Soviet BOR-4 spaceplane design. Its stated goals were to achieve low operational costs, improved flight safety, and a possibility of landing on conventional runways. No flight hardware was built.|$|E
25|$|The program {{demonstrated}} that the vehicle was able to generate lift/drag ratio of 3.5 to 1, allowing it to greatly extend its range. Although this was not put to immediate use, the tests provided valuable data that was used for later programs like the Boost Glide Reentry Vehicle and the ASSET and PRIME programs. Better understanding of the hypersonic lift process also led to the <b>lifting</b> <b>body</b> designs of the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|In 1960 {{the company}} {{abandoned}} aircraft design, {{changed its name}} to The Martin Corporation and produced missiles like the Titan missile series. From 1965, as the Martin Marietta Corporation, it produced <b>lifting</b> <b>bodies.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although the Zero-X {{does not}} appear in Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet (2005), a {{reference}} is made to it through the depiction of <b>lifting</b> <b>bodies</b> being used to assist spaceships in entering Earth orbit.|$|R
50|$|After {{learning}} about a remark by Chuck Yeager, {{that he would}} like to have some jet-powered <b>lifting</b> <b>bodies</b> for training purposes, Martin designed and built, on their own initiative, two examples of the SV-5J.|$|R
25|$|The {{version of}} Kliper {{presented}} during the bid in January 2006 differs {{again from the}} original design. It showed a <b>lifting</b> <b>body</b> with larger wings, that, according to Energia officials, could be folded around the core crew module and unfold after atmospheric re-entry {{in order to provide}} cross-range and better landing accuracy for the spacecraft. The light Kliper version proposed was stripped down to 7 tons and uses the 'split-up'-option with Parom as a spacetug.|$|E
25|$|The Dream Chaser {{spacecraft}} {{is based}} on the HL-20 <b>lifting</b> <b>body</b> design. It was developed by SpaceDev for the 2004 Commercial Orbital Transportation Services competition, and was being developed by Sierra Nevada Corporation for the Commercial Crew Development program (CCDev). The crewed Dream Chaser was not selected by NASA for the final phase of development of commercial crew (CCtCap). However, the cargo Dream Chaser was selected by NASA for its Commercial Resupply Services 2 (CRS2) program.|$|E
25|$|Designed {{primarily}} {{to replace the}} Soyuz spacecraft, Kliper was proposed in two versions: as a pure <b>lifting</b> <b>body</b> design and as spaceplane with small wings. In either case, the craft {{would have been able}} to glide into the atmosphere at an angle that produces much less stress on the human occupants than the current Soyuz. Kliper was intended to be designed to be able to carry up to six people and to perform ferry services between Earth and the International Space Station.|$|E
50|$|As a NASA {{research}} pilot he flew a {{wide variety}} of airplanes including the F5D-1, F-100, F-104, F-111A, B-52, NT-33A Variable Stability Trainer, the wingless <b>lifting</b> <b>bodies</b> and numerous general aviation aircraft as well as several types of helicopters and sailplanes.|$|R

25|$|Gentry transitioned {{to another}} heavyweight <b>lifting</b> <b>body,</b> the Northrop HL-10, {{and made the}} second flight of this vehicle on March 15, 1968. The HL-10 had just {{returned}} to flying status after nearly sixteen months of modifications to correct handling deficiencies. Gentry confirmed that the modifications were successful and reestablished confidence in the HL-10. On October 23, 1968, Gentry attempted the first powered flight in the HL-10. However, the rocket engine failed shortly after launch resulting in an emergency landing on Rosamond Dry Lake.|$|E
25|$|The {{historical}} {{antecedents of}} the Dream Chaser in the U.S. {{go back to}} the mid-twentieth century X-20 Dyna-Soar concept of 1957 and the 1966 Northrop M2-F2 and Martin X-23 PRIME lifting bodies. Its design is derived from NASA's 1990 HL-20 <b>lifting</b> <b>body</b> design which was itself similar to the 1970s Soviet Spiral, which in turn was considered by NASA engineers as influenced by the late 1960s HL-10, and the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-105 military spaceplane concept, a spaceplane studied as a means to develop a Soviet counterpart to the US's X-20 Dyna-Soar.|$|E
25|$|For {{his work}} on the HL-10, Gentry was awarded the 1968 Harmon Aviator's Trophy for {{outstanding}} contribution to the science of flying. In 1969, the Society of Experimental Test Pilots presented Gentry with the Iven C. Kincheloe Award for {{his work on}} the NASA/Flight Research Center (FRC) <b>Lifting</b> <b>Body</b> Program.
