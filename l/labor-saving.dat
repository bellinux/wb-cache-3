John Fitch had launched the first rudimentary steamboat onto the Delaware River in the late 1780s, and the Philadelphia waterworks was by 1802 operating two low-pressure steam engines to pump water from the Schuylkill River, but these were rare examples and most instances of this new technology were to be found in Europe. Much of the development of steam power had occurred in Great Britain, with Thomas Newcomen and James Watt instrumental in developing and commercializing steam power there and elsewhere in Europe, with several hundred of machines operating there in industrial and <b>labor-saving</b> applications by 1800.|$|E

40|$|Many {{companies}} configure their warehouse with {{a forward}} {{area and a}} reserve area. The former is used for efficient order-picking, the latter for replenishing the forward area. We consider {{a situation in which}} orders are picked during a certain time period, referred to as the picking period. Prior to the picking period there is sufficient time to replenish the forward area. Our objective is to determine which replenishments minimize the expected amount of labor during the picking period. Further, we present a second model with a constraint on the replenishment activity. We model the problem as a binary programming problem and present efficient heuristics that provide tight performance guarantees. We compare the heuristics with procedures that are popular in practice and show that significant <b>labor-savings</b> are possible. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} in consecutive years over the time period 14 January to 1 July to determine whether <b>labor-savings</b> and fish growth enhancement could be achieved by stocking Tilapia rendalli directly into ponds containing weeds left from a dry period. Six replicates 200 sq. m ponds located at the Malawi National Aquaculture Centre, Domasi were drained, left dry for 63 days and natural growth of weeds was allowed. All ponds were stocked with 200 T. rendalli fingerlings (study 1) or adults (study 2) averaging 4. 6 g (40 mm TL) and 47. 7 (130 mm TL), respectively. For T. rendalli juveniles, final standing stock, growth and offspring production were significantly (P< 0. 05) better in fed than in weedy ponds. Average weight of fingerlings were significantly (P< 0. 05) different between the two treatments. For T. rendalli adults, final standing stock, growth and offspring production were not affected {{by the presence of}} weeds...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{temporally}} high N treatment {{prior to the}} transplanting and coating urea application on the growth and yield were investigated to develop a fertilization method for low-input rice cultivation through <b>labor-savings</b> {{and a decrease in}} the application amount. High N treatment and coating urea plof (LT plot : 3. 15 kgN / 10 a), coating urea plot (L plot : 3 kgN / 10 a) and high N treatment plot (T plot : 0. 15 kgN / 10 a) fare the yield by 83 %, 82 %, and 76 % of control plot (C plot : 6 kgN / 10 a), respectively. There was no significantly difference in the yield among the four plots. Yield of 0 N plot was 69 % of C plot and was significantly low compared with that of the C plot. Distinctive differences in panicle number per hill and 1000 grains weight was not found among the five plots. The spikelet number per panicle was greatest in the C plot, followed by the L plot, LT plot, T plot and 0 N plot, while the differences between the L plot, LT plot and T plot were not significant. The difference in spikelet nurnber per panicle was attributed to the differences in the tillering pattern and nitrogen content per stem. The first tiller emerged from the 6 th node in the 0 N plot and from the 5 th node in the other plots. Rice plants in the 0 N plot had panicles having a smaller number of spikelets compared with those in the other plots. The top dressing for the C plot attained a higher nitrogen content per stem. Filled grain percentage was lower in the C plot than in the othor plots. From these results, it was considered that securement of a sufficient yield with <b>labor-savings</b> compared to standard cultivation and the decrease of the amount of fertilizer application by the high N treatment, and coating urea application would be possible. 本田への施肥作業の省略と少肥栽培による低コスト稲作技術の開発を指向し，移植直前の一時的な高窒素処理と被覆尿素の併用が移植後の生育と収量に及ぼす影響について調査した。高窒素処理・被覆尿素併用区（LT区 : 3. 15 kgN/ 10 a）では対照区（C区 : 6 kgN/ 10 a）の 83 %，被覆尿素区（L区 : 3 kgN/ 10 a）で 82 %，高窒素処理区（T区 : 0. 15 kgN/ 10 a）で 76 %の収量が得られ，C区とこれら 4 区では有意差はみられなかったが，無施肥区（ON区 : 0 kgN/ 10 a）は 69 %と低収であった。 1 株穂数と千粒重に試験区間差はみられなかった。１穂籾数はC区>LT区≒L区≒T区>ON区であった。この差異は，ON区に比べて他の 4 区では初発分げつ節位が低く， 1 株穂数は同じであっても稲体はより籾数の多い低節位の穂によって構成されていたこと，また，C区では幼穂形成期における 1 茎当たり窒素含有量が高かったことによるものと考えられた。登熟歩合はC区よりも他の 4 区で有意に高かった。本実験により，移植直前の高窒素処理と被覆尿素の併用により，本田施肥を省略し，施肥量を削減しつつも，標準的な栽培と比較して十分な収量を確保し得る可能性が示された...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Using four {{input-output}} tables and disaggregated data on total employment, we decompose labor productivity growth from 1987 to 2005. We {{do so by}} examining six partial factors: changes in value-added coefficients, labor inputs, shares of sectoral demands that are fulfilled domestically, technology, and the intra-sectoral shares and intersectoral mix of final demand. Our analysis confirms that simply because {{by virtue of its}} size and extremely low level of labor productivity, change involving China’s farm sector weighs heavily. Indeed, it is largely due to labor shifts out of farming and some modest (and possibly consequential) rises in the industry’s productivity that, among the six factors, <b>labor-savings</b> effects have levied the largest influence on the labor productivity upon all sectors across all three periods covered by our research. Nonetheless, changes in the intrasectoral shares and the intersectoral mix of China’s final demand were quite strong and across the periods of study persistently and significantly increased their influence. Due to ever competitive pressures that have been increasing as China continues to open its economy to international market markets, changes in value-added coefficients have tended to counteract some of the positive benefits of labor savings across time for most sectors. The effects on changes in labor productivity of technological change and changes in the use of imports have been comparatively negligible and variation in their sectoral effects waning over time. 1...|$|R
40|$|Calorimetric {{biochemical}} measurements offer various advantages such as low waste, low cost, low sample consumption, short operating time, and <b>labor-savings.</b> Multichannel calorimeters {{can enhance}} the possibility of performing higher-throughput biochemical measurements. An enthalpy sensor (ES) array is a key device in multichannel calorimeters. Most ES arrays use Wheatstone bridge amplifiers to condition the sensor signals, but such an approach is only suitable for null detection and low resistance sensors. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a multichannel calorimetric simultaneous assay (MCSA) platform. An adjustable microampere constant-current (AMCC) source was designed for exciting the ES array using a microampere current loop measurement circuit topology. The MCSA platform comprises a measurement unit, which contains a multichannel calorimeter and an automatic simultaneous injector, and a signal processing unit, which contains multiple ES signal conditioners and a data processor. This study focused {{on the construction of}} the MCSA platform; in particular, construction of the measurement circuit and calorimeter array in a single block. The performance of the platform, including current stability, temperature sensitivity and heat sensitivity, was evaluated. The sensor response time and calorimeter constants were given. The capability of the platform to detect relative enzyme activity was also demonstrated. The experimental results show that the proposed MCSA is a flexible and powerful biochemical measurement device with higher throughput than existing alternatives...|$|R
25|$|Roach {{had long}} nurtured {{a desire to}} become a builder of marine steam engines like his mentor James Allaire. Competition in the {{industry}} was fierce, and entry difficult due to high capital costs, but Roach believed that by utilization of the best tools, <b>labor-saving</b> devices and practices, he could compete successfully. Accordingly, through the late 1850s he sent engineers to the United Kingdom to study the latest in marine engine technology, and was not above hiring himself out as a mechanic to New York's leading engine builders {{of the day to}} spy on their organization, technology and practices.|$|E

25|$|A {{skid loader}} or {{skid steer loader}} is a small rigid frame, {{engine-powered}} machine with lift arms used to attach {{a wide variety of}} <b>labor-saving</b> tools or attachments. Though sometimes they are equipped with tracks, skid-steer loaders are typically four-wheel drive vehicles that can push material from one location to another, carry material in its bucket, or load material into a truck or trailer. Brothers Louis and Cyrill Keller co-invented the first skid-steer loader, which was based around a three-wheeled loader they developed in 1957 for a turkey farmer near Rothsay, Minnesota. In September 1958, they were hired by the Melroe brothers at Melroe Manufacturing Company in Gwinner, North Dakota, which was later to become Bobcat Company. Using the brothers' design, Melroe introduced the M60 Self-Propelled Loader and, in 1960, Louis added a rear drive axle, resulting in the M400 model, the world's first true skid-steer loader.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} of Dutch industry and agriculture was a defensive realignment in three directions. First, {{there was a}} shift in the product mix to higher value products (for instance more luxury textile products, livestock fattening instead of dairy farming). This was of necessity a self-limiting solution, as it made exporting even more difficult, so this response led to a further contraction of the sectors in question. The second response was investment in <b>labor-saving</b> means of production. However, this required a level of technological innovation that apparently was no longer attainable. (In this respect it is remarkable that the number of patents granted in the Netherlands was remarkably lower in this period than {{in the first half of}} the 17th century.) Besides, this type of reorientation in investment was undercut by a third response: outsourcing of industrial production to areas with a lower wage level, like the Generality Lands, which solved the high-wage problem in a different way, but also contributed to deindustralization in the maritime provinces.|$|E
500|$|A {{sedentary}} lifestyle plays {{a significant role}} in obesity. Worldwide there has been a large shift towards less physically demanding work, and currently at least 30% of the world's population gets insufficient exercise. This is primarily due to increasing use of mechanized transportation and a greater prevalence of <b>labor-saving</b> technology in the home. [...] In children, there appear to be declines in levels of physical activity due to less walking and physical education. World trends in active leisure time physical activity are less clear. The World Health Organization indicates people worldwide are taking up less active recreational pursuits, while a study from Finland found an increase and a study from the United States found leisure-time physical activity has not changed significantly.

2500|$|In {{the days}} before mechanization, round barns were seen as being useful because of their <b>labor-saving</b> features: the {{livestock}} could be fed in one pass around the barn, using the hay stored in the loft above the stock and the grain in the central silo.

2500|$|Modern conveniences are <b>labor-saving</b> devices, services, and {{substances}} {{that make a}} task easier or more efficient to perform than a traditional method. [...] Because of the historical use of the term, and the differences in lifestyles around the world, the term is a relative term based upon the conveniences previously available to a person or group.

2500|$|In 1905, the Journal of the American Medical Association {{published}} an article titled [...] "Nervous Strain" [...] about how [...] "modern conveniences" [...] make our lives busier and with less direct contact than the preceding generations. As an example, the author compared having a calming cup of tea with a person to the more distant practice of placing a telephone call. <b>Labor-saving</b> devices meant that people now spent more time sitting, breathed machine-generated smoke, and ate food, especially meat, fat and sugars, in greater abundance, changing peoples' diets. These activities were speculated to result in high blood pressure, obesity, and [...] "nervous strain".|$|E
2500|$|Paradoxically, {{the cotton}} gin, a <b>labor-saving</b> device, helped {{preserve}} {{slavery in the}} U.S. Before the 1790s, slave labor was primarily employed in growing rice, tobacco, and indigo, none of which were especially profitable any more. Neither was cotton, due {{to the difficulty of}} seed removal. But with the gin, growing cotton with slave labor became highly profitable – the chief source of wealth in the American South, and the basis of frontier settlement from Georgia to Texas. [...] "King Cotton" [...] became a dominant economic force, and slavery was sustained as a key institution of Southern society.|$|E
2500|$|By raising productivity, <b>labor-saving</b> {{technologies}} {{can increase}} the average industrial rate of profit rather than lowering it, insofar as fewer workers can produce vastly more output at a lower cost. Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz stated: [...] "Marx’s own proof of his law of the falling rate of profit errs principally in disregarding the mathematical relationship between the productivity of labour {{and the rate of}} surplus value." [...] Jürgen Habermas argued in 1973–74 that the TRPF might have existed in 19th century liberal capitalism, but no longer existed in late capitalism, because of the expansion of [...] "reflexive labor" [...] ("labor applied to itself with the aim of increasing the productivity of labor").|$|E
2500|$|In 1889, {{architect}} and author Louis. H. Gibson defined modern conveniences as [...] "those arrangements and appliances which {{make it possible}} for people to live comfortably in a larger house, without seriously increasing the cares which they had in a smaller one". The supposition is that at that time if a family lived in a smaller home, they would have less furniture, appliances and other goods to take care of, and as a result the family's lifestyle and housekeeping would be relatively easy. [...] If, on the other hand, a family moved into a larger home the increase area and furnishings would be much more difficult to manage without <b>labor-saving</b> devices.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} ramifications of the {{development}} of modern conveniences for individuals and their families over the past 150 or more years. [...] The many <b>labor-saving</b> devices have kept pace with growing houses and furnishings and allow for greater leisure. There are also some negative effects, some of which are also as the result of advancements in chemical technology in the food that we eat or products that we use. [...] In these cases there are also conflicting opinions {{about the extent to which}} some of the products are harmful.

2500|$|Two key {{concepts}} for understanding Amish practices are their rejection of Hochmut (pride, arrogance, haughtiness) {{and the high}} value they place on Demut (humility) and Gelassenheit (calmness, composure, placidity), often translated as [...] "submission" [...] or [...] "letting-be". Gelassenheit is perhaps better understood as a reluctance to be forward, to be self-promoting, or to assert oneself. The Amish's willingness {{to submit to the}} [...] "Will of Jesus", expressed through group norms, is at odds with the individualism so central to the wider American culture. The Amish anti-individualist orientation is the motive for rejecting <b>labor-saving</b> technologies that might make one less dependent on community. Modern innovations like electricity might spark a competition for status goods, or photographs might cultivate personal vanity. Electricity lines would be going against the Bible, which says that you shall not be [...] "Conformed to the world" [...] (Romans 12:2).|$|E
2500|$|Industry {{consequently}} became {{prominent in}} the area. Gloversville was labeled the [...] "headquarters of the glove and mitten industry" [...] and became the preeminent glove-manufacturing and leather-working region in New York. Cohoes {{became known as the}} Spindle City for its large cotton mills, due mainly to Harmony Mills, the largest cotton mill complex in the world when it opened in 1872. Troy became famous for its iron works due to Burden Iron Works, though later Troy would earn the nickname of Collar City due to Cluett, Peabody & Co., which made Arrow brand shirts at the largest collar, cuff, and shirt factory in the world at the time. In 1887 Thomas Edison moved his Edison Machine Works to Schenectady, and in 1892 Schenectady became the headquarters of the General Electric Company (GE). Schenectady Locomotive Works, along with seven other locomotive manufacturers, merged in 1901 and the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) was formed and headquartered in Schenectady. Due to the dominance of GE and ALCO in their respective industries, Schenectady would gain the nicknames of Electric City and [...] "The City that Lights and Hauls the World". The nature of this industry lent itself to the creation of many <b>labor-saving</b> inventions, such as the horseshoe machine of Henry Burden, the pre-shrinking fabric machines of Sanford Cluett, the power knitting loom of Timothy Bailey, the railroad air-brake of George Westinghouse, and the hundreds of electricity-related improvements of General Electric Company scientists.|$|E
2500|$|The {{manual labor}} {{to build the}} Central Pacific's roadbed, bridges and tunnels was done {{primarily}} by many thousands of emigrant workers from China {{under the direction of}} skilled non-Chinese supervisors. The Chinese were commonly referred to at the time as [...] "Celestials" [...] and China as the [...] "Celestial Kingdom." [...] <b>Labor-saving</b> devices in those days consisted primarily of wheelbarrows, horse or mule pulled carts, and a few railroad pulled gondolas. The construction work involved an immense amount of manual labor. Initially, Central Pacific had a hard time hiring and keeping unskilled workers on its line, as many would leave for the prospect of far more lucrative gold or silver mining options elsewhere. Despite the concerns expressed by Charles Crocker, one of the [...] "big four" [...] and a general contractor, that the Chinese were too small in stature, standing at about , weighing about , and lacking previous experience with railroad work, they decided to try them anyway. [...] After {{the first few days of}} trial with a few workers, with noticeably positive results, Crocker decided to hire as many as he could, looking primarily at the California labor force, where the majority of Chinese worked as independent gold miners or in the service industries (e.g.: laundries and kitchens). Most of these Chinese workers were represented by a Chinese [...] "boss" [...] who translated, collected salaries for his crew, kept discipline and relayed orders from an American general supervisor. Most Chinese workers spoke only rudimentary or no English, and the supervisors typically only learned rudimentary Chinese. Many more workers were imported from the Guangdong Province of China, which at the time, beside great poverty, suffered from the violence of the Taiping Rebellion. Most Chinese workers were planning on returning with their new found [...] "wealth" [...] when the work was completed. Most of the men received between one and three dollars per day, the same as unskilled white workers; but the workers imported directly from China sometimes received less. A diligent worker could save over $20 per month after paying for food and lodging—a [...] "fortune" [...] by Chinese standards. A snapshot of workers in late 1865 showed about 3,000 Chinese and 1,700 white workers employed on the railroad. Nearly all of the white workers were in supervisory or skilled craft positions and made more money than the Chinese.|$|E
