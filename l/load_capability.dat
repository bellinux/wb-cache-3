25|$|In {{support of}} Operation Deep Freeze, the {{squadron}} operated {{a variety of}} aircraft {{throughout the course of}} its existence. Fixed-wing aircraft included the Grumman UF-1L Albatross, UC-1 Otter, Douglas Skytrain (R4D Dakota and C-47 models), Douglas Skymaster (R5D and C-54 models), Lockheed Neptune (P2V-2 and P2V-7 models), Lockheed Constellation (R7D and R7V models), and the Lockheed LC-130 Hercules.

40|$|Abstract—A risk-based {{probabilistic}} method {{is presented to}} assess transformer <b>loading</b> <b>capability,</b> {{taking into account the}} probabilistic nature of time-varying loads and ambient temper-ature. A sample calculation, with both component level analysis and system level analysis, is given. Quantitative reference risk levels are obtained based on reference loading levels given by IEEE/ANSI C 57. 115 - 1991. It shows that our quantitative risk assessment is useful in assessing transformer loading and in aiding related decision making. An additional benefit is that it enables inclusion of transformer loading in composite system risk analysis.

50|$|By {{increasing}} the contact {{area of the}} ball bearings on the shaft to approximately 45 degrees, the side load and direct <b>load</b> carrying <b>capabilities</b> are greatly increased. Each nut can be individually preloaded at the factory to decrease the available radial play to ensure rigidity. This process not only increases the contact area, increasing direct <b>loading</b> <b>capabilities,</b> but it also restricts any radial movement, {{increasing the}} overhung moment capabilities. This creates a sturdier structure that can handle a very strenuous working environment.|$|R
50|$|In 1930, Ernst Heinkel began {{developing}} an aircraft for the Reichsmarine. To conceal the true military intentions, the aircraft was officially a civil aircraft. The He 59B landplane prototype {{was the first}} to fly, an event that took place in September 1931, but it was the He 59A floatplane prototype that {{paved the way for the}} He 59B initial production model, of which 142 were delivered in three variants. The Heinkel He 59 was a pleasant aircraft to fly; deficiencies noted were the weak engine, the limited range, the small <b>load</b> <b>capability</b> and insufficient armament.|$|E
50|$|Using network topology, {{transmission}} line parameters, transformer parameters, generator location and limits, and load location and compensation, the load-flow calculation can provide voltage magnitudes and angles for all nodes and loading of network components, such as cables and transformers. With this information, compliance to operating limitations {{such as those}} stipulated by voltage ranges and maximum loads, can be examined. This is, for example, important for determining the transmission capacity of underground cables, where the influence of cable bundling on the <b>load</b> <b>capability</b> of each cable {{has to be taken}} also into account.|$|E
50|$|With {{the initial}} {{introduction}} of the new F-Series in the later half of 1997, only the F-150 was produced. To {{bridge the gap between}} the F-150 and the previous generation heavier-duty models (to be replaced by the Super Duty series for 1999), the light-duty F-250 was produced as a temporary model for 1997-1999. While externally similar to the F-150 (with the exception of its 7-lug wheels), the F-250 gained increased <b>load</b> <b>capability</b> from a heavy-duty rear axle and load-leveling rear suspension. The F-250 HD (Heavy Duty) was in the same series as the F-350.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} Controlled Diffusion Airfoils has been {{developed}} for multistage compressor application. These airfoils are designed analytically to be shock free at transonic Mach number and to avoid suction surface boundary layer separation {{for a range of}} inlet conditions necessary for stable compressor operation. They have demonstrated, in cascade testing, higher critical Mach number, higher incidence range, and higher <b>loading</b> <b>capability</b> than standard series airfoils designed for equivalent aerodynamic requirements. These airfoils have been shown, in single and multistage rig testing, to provide high efficiency, high <b>loading</b> <b>capability,</b> and ease of stage matching, leading to reduced development costs and improved surge margin. The Controlled Diffusion Airfoil profile shapes tend to have thicker leading and trailing edges than their standard series counterparts, leading to improved compressor durability...|$|R

50|$|The center {{repaired}} and overhauled B-52s {{for over}} 30 years. In the early 1960s, the B-52 Stratofortress {{was the major}} depot-level maintenance workload for SAAMA. Modifications to the B-52s performed at Kelly increased the <b>load</b> <b>capability</b> of each plane and increased the aircraft's range. In addition, the San Antonio shops camouflage-painted the B-52Gs for Southeast Asia Arc Light operations. This era in Kelly's history ended when the Air Force shifted the B-52 workload to Oklahoma City AMA at Tinker AFB {{in the spring of}} 1993. The 36-year-old relationship between Kelly and the big bomber was the longest association between any Air Force weapons system and a single ALC to that point.|$|E
50|$|The {{transmission}} system provides for base load and peak <b>load</b> <b>capability,</b> with safety and fault tolerance margins. The peak load times vary by region {{largely due to}} the industry mix. In very hot and very cold climates home air conditioning and heating loads {{have an effect on the}} overall load. They are typically highest in the late afternoon in the hottest part of the year and in mid-mornings and mid-evenings in the coldest part of the year. This makes the power requirements vary by the season and the time of day. Distribution system designs always take the base load and the peak load into consideration.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The strain-rate {{effects of}} {{reinforced}} concrete beams are studied in this paper. Considering the strain-rate effects of structural material, dynamic responses of reinforced concrete beams subjected to monotonic loading and cyclic loading at different loading rates {{that might be}} experienced during earthquakes are simulated using the nonlinear finite element program ABAQUS. The influences of loading rate on <b>loading</b> <b>capability</b> and failure mode of reinforced concrete beams are investigated. The results show that as the loading rate increases, the <b>loading</b> <b>capability</b> increases, the increment {{is associated with the}} shear span ratio and loading mode. The increment at cyclic loading is smaller than that at monotonic loading; as the shear span ratio changes, the failure mode changes, the increment changes; the failure mode {{has nothing to do with}} the loading rate...|$|R

5000|$|Like {{the other}} mini-pickups of the time, it {{featured}} a sub-2-liter four-cylinder engine, a four-speed manual transmission, rear-wheel drive, an impressive <b>load</b> <b>capability</b> of 1,400 lb (635 kg) considering its size, and a fairly small price tag compared to full-size pickups of the time. To circumvent the 25% [...] "chicken tax" [...] on light trucks, Couriers (as with Chevrolet LUVs) were imported in [...] "cab chassis" [...] configurations, {{which included the}} entire light truck - less the cargo box or truck bed - and were only subject to a 4% tariff.

50|$|During {{the course}} of the next three years, three {{helicopters}} would be evaluated as candidates to replace the OH-13 and OH-23; the Sud-Ouest Djinn, the Hughes 269, and the Brantly B-2. The aircraft were designated the YHO-1 DJ, YHO-2 HU, and YHO-3 BR, respectively. By October 1958, service testing of Sud Aviation YHO-1 DJ was completed. The following year saw the completion of the desert and temperate temperature testing of the YHO-2 HU. The YHO-3 BR did not complete user testing after engineering evaluations revealed significant deficiencies. Service testing demonstrated that the YHO-2 had been the most capable, but due to a limited <b>load</b> <b>capability,</b> it was deemed not suitable to replace the OH-13.|$|E
50|$|As the war progressed, ATC {{received}} improved aircraft types {{for transport}} duty, including the Curtiss-Wright C-46 Commando and the Douglas C-54 Skymaster, a militarized transport {{version of the}} DC-4. The C-54 in particular took over the C-87's duties in long-distance, over-water transport flights. In the China-India theater, the C-54, with nearly five times the load capacity of the C-47 and twice that of the C-46, significantly increased cargo tonnage levels flown to China, becoming the primary lifter for Hump operations. Even though the C-54 had a service ceiling of only 12,000 feet, plans were made to replace all the C-87s in the Hump operation with Skymasters by October 1945, and have 540 assigned by April 1946 to bring <b>load</b> <b>capability</b> up to 86,000 tons monthly.|$|E
