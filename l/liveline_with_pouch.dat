40|$|Aspects on Long-term Outcome After Restorative Proctocolectomy Abstract Background Restorative proctocolectomy is the {{preferred}} surgical alternative for reconstruction after proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis. The majority of patients are satisfied with the functional outcome. However, a proportion of the patients suffer from complications and impaired pouch function. Furthermore, about 10 % of the patients will have a definitive failure of the pouch. The aim of this thesis was to explore some of the long-term aspects of this surgical procedure. Methods Paper I: 42 patients were assessed <b>with</b> a <b>pouch</b> functional score and manovolumetry. The outcome after median 16 years were compared to two years after surgery in a paired analysis. Paper II: Grade of inflammation, possible dysplasia and pouch related problems were assessed in 13 patients <b>with</b> <b>pouch</b> failure and the pouch still in place but deviated with an ileostomy. Paper III: 36 patients <b>with</b> <b>pouch</b> failure were compared to 72, age and gender matched patients <b>with</b> functioning <b>pouches,</b> regarding sexual function, body image and health related quality of life. The instrument used for sexual function was the female sexual function index (FSFI) and the international index of erectile function (IIEF). Body image was assessed with the body image scale (BIS), and health related quality of life with SF- 36. Swedish version. 2. 0. Paper IV: is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind study {{on the effects of}} probiotics (Lactobacillus plantarum 299, Bifidobacterium infantis Cure 21) on 31 patients <b>with</b> poor <b>pouch</b> function. Assessments were made <b>with</b> a <b>pouch</b> functional index, the pouchitis activity index (PDAI), endoscopy, histology and faecal biomarkers. Results The pouch functional score showed impairment at 16 year as well as the manovolumetric characteristics, except for resting anal pressure. Increased age and pouch volume were correlated to a worse functional score (Paper I). The majority of patients had no problems <b>with</b> the defunctioned <b>pouch</b> and dysplasia was not found (Paper II). Patients <b>with</b> <b>pouch</b> failure demonstrated lower scores in all domains in the FSFI and IIEF, as well as lower summary score in both instruments. However, the differences were not statistically significant. BIS summary score was significantly lower for both sexes in the patients <b>with</b> <b>pouch</b> failure. All domain SF- 36 scores were lower for both sexes <b>with</b> <b>pouch</b> failure, though not statistically significant (Paper III). There {{was no significant difference between}} the probiotics and placebo groups regarding pouch functional score, PDAI or faecal biomarkers after treatment. Initial values of PDAI correlated significantly to all faecal biomarkers (Paoer IV). Conclusions A decline in pouch function at long-term, concurrent <b>with</b> alterations in <b>pouch</b> physiology as assessed with manovolumetry was demonstrated. The mucosa in the indefinitely deviated pouch showed no dysplasia. Furthermore, the majority of the deviated patients had no pouch related symptoms. This indicates that the pouch could be left in situ in case of pouch failure, but further follow-up is needed. Patients <b>with</b> <b>pouch</b> failure seem to have an impaired body image, but sexual function and health related quality of life were not significantly different compared to patients <b>with</b> functioning <b>pouches.</b> Probiotics did not improve poor pouch function compared to placebo...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic {{adjustable}} gastric banding (LAGB) slippage <b>with</b> <b>pouch</b> dilation is one {{the most}} serious long-term complications and requires reoperation in most cases. It is still controversial whether banding should be offered again or a different procedure should be chosen. We report the results of synchronous de-rebanding on a prospective series of patients treated at our institution for slippage <b>with</b> <b>pouch</b> dilation. METHODS: From January 2000 to May 2007, 29 consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic de-rebanding for slippage <b>with</b> <b>pouch</b> dilation. The mean age at primary operation was 38. 9 +/- 8. 2 years and the mean BMI was 46. 4 +/- 8 kg/m(2). Twenty-eight had previous LAGB, while one had previous open gastric banding, the perigastric technique being used at that time. All the redo procedures were successfully carried out under laparoscopy, via the pars flaccida technique, and all the patients were followed-up according to the usual schedule. RESULTS: The mean time from the original LAGB was 45. 3 +/- 30. 3 months, and the mean follow-up after rebanding was 26. 9 +/- 20. 6 months. At rebanding, the mean BMI was 34. 3 +/- 7. 6, percent excess weight loss (...|$|R

40|$|Restorative proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal {{anastomosis}} (IPAA) {{has been}} carried out on 88 patients since 1982. Three different pouch designs (J, S and W) were used. Ten pouches had to be removed. Detailed analysis was performed on 61 patients (J = 23, S = 15, W = 23) whose pouches had been functioning for at least 6 months. There {{was no significant difference in}} surgical complications before or after ileostomy closure between pouch designs but the hospital stay was greater after construction of an S pouch (P less than 0. 05). There were no significant differences in stool frequency, degree of continence or urgency between the three types. Twelve patients <b>with</b> J <b>pouches</b> required antidiarrhoeal medication compared with only one with S and five <b>with</b> W <b>pouches.</b> Only seven patients <b>with</b> S <b>pouches</b> could defaecate spontaneously compared with 22 <b>with</b> W <b>pouches</b> and all patients <b>with</b> J <b>pouches</b> (P less than 0. 001).

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the reconstruction methods applied after total gastrectomy in terms of postoperative symptomology and nutrition. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted on 31 patients who underwent total gastrectomy due to gastric cancer in 2. Clinic of General Surgery, SSK Ankara Training Hospital. 6 different reconstruction methods were used and analyzed in terms of age, sex and postoperative complications. One from esophagus and two biopsy specimens from jejunum were taken through upper gastrointestinal endoscopy from all cases, and late period morphological and microbiological changes were examined. Postoperative weight change, dumping symptoms, reflux esophagitis, solid/liquid dysphagia, early satiety, postprandial pain, diarrhea and anorexia were assessed. Results: Of 31 patients, 18 were males and 13 females; the youngest one was 33 years old, while the oldest- 69 years old. It was found that reconstruction without pouch was performed in 22 cases and <b>with</b> <b>pouch</b> in 9 cases. Early satiety, postprandial pain, dumping symptoms, diarrhea and anemia were found most commonly in cases <b>with</b> reconstruction without <b>pouch.</b> The rate of bacterial colonization of the jejunal mucosa was identical in both groups.

40|$|It {{is unclear}} whether {{infliximab}} treatment induces increased complication rates after surgery for ulcerative colitis. Aim was to compare complication rates after pouch surgery in refractory ulcerative colitis patients with versus without previous infliximab therapy. We performed a retrospective study evaluating all patients who underwent an ileoanal J-pouch for refractory ulcerative colitis over a four-year period. Postoperative complications, infliximab use and time between last infliximab administration and restorative surgery were assessed. 1 -stage procedures (proctocolectomy <b>with</b> <b>pouch,</b> <b>with</b> or without temporary diversion) and 2 -stage procedures (emergency colectomy and subsequent completion proctectomy <b>with</b> <b>pouch,</b> <b>with</b> or without temporary diversion) were analyzed separately. Seventy-two patients were included; 33 underwent 1 -stage procedure and 39 had 2 -stage surgery. In the 1 -stage group, 21 patients (64 %) had previous infliximab therapy (median time between last infusion and surgery: 7. 1 months (IQR 2. 6 - 8. 3)). Infliximab-treated patients had higher incidence of pelvic sepsis (5 / 21 vs. 0 / 12; risk difference 24 %; 95 % CI: 6 to 42, p= 0. 067) and non-infectious complications (8 / 21 vs. 1 / 12; risk difference 30 %; 95 % CI: 4 to 56, p= 0. 065). In the 2 -stage group, 17 (44 %) had previous infliximab therapy (median time between last infusion and surgery: 11. 8 months (IQR 7. 3 - 15. 5)). Total, infectious, non-infectious complication rates and pelvic sepsis rates were similar for infliximab and non-infliximab patients in the 2 -stage group.
