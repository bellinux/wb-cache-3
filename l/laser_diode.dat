5|$|Lasers {{emitting}} in {{the green}} part of the spectrum are widely available {{to the general public}} {{in a wide range of}} output powers. Green laser pointers outputting at 532nm (563.5 THz) are relatively inexpensive compared to other wavelengths of the same power, and are very popular due to their good beam quality and very high apparent brightness. The most common green lasers use diode pumped solid state (DPSS) technology to create the green light. An infrared <b>laser</b> <b>diode</b> at 808nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium-doped yttrium vanadium oxide (Nd:YVO4) or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) and induces it to emit 281.76 THz (1064nm). This deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing potassium, titanium and phosphorus (KTP), whose non-linear properties generate light at a frequency that is twice that of the incident beam (563.5 THz); in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 532nm ("green"). Other green wavelengths are also available using DPSS technology ranging from 501nm to 543nm. Green wavelengths are also available from gas lasers, including the helium–neon laser (543nm), the Argon-ion laser (514nm) and the Krypton-ion laser (521nm and 531nm), as well as liquid dye lasers. Green lasers have a wide variety of applications, including pointing, illumination, surgery, laser light shows, spectroscopy, interferometry, fluorescence, holography, machine vision, non-lethal weapons and bird control.|$|E
25|$|A <b>laser</b> <b>diode,</b> or LD {{also known}} as {{injection}} <b>laser</b> <b>diode</b> or ILD, is a semiconductor device similar to a light-emitting diode in which the laser beam is created at the diode's junction.|$|E
25|$|A <b>laser</b> <b>diode</b> is a laser {{where the}} active medium is a {{semiconductor}} {{similar to that}} found in a light-emitting diode. The most common and practical type of <b>laser</b> <b>diode</b> is formed from a p-n junction and powered by injected electric current. These devices are {{sometimes referred to as}} injection laser diodes to distinguish them from optically pumped laser diodes, which are more easily manufactured in the laboratory. The <b>laser</b> <b>diode</b> was invented in 1962 by Robert N. Hall.|$|E

25|$|A <b>laser</b> <b>diode</b> is {{electrically}} a PIN diode. The {{active region}} of the <b>laser</b> <b>diode</b> is in the intrinsic (I) region, and the carriers (electrons and holes) are pumped into that region from the N and P regions respectively. While initial diode laser research was conducted on simple P-N diodes, all modern lasers use the double-hetero-structure implementation, where the carriers and the photons are confined {{in order to maximize}} their chances for recombination and light generation. Unlike a regular diode, the goal for a <b>laser</b> <b>diode</b> is to recombine all carriers in the I region, and produce light. Thus, laser diodes are fabricated using direct band-gap semiconductors. The <b>laser</b> <b>diode</b> epitaxial structure is grown using one of the crystal growth techniques, usually starting from an N doped substrate, and growing the I doped active layer, followed by the P doped cladding, and a contact layer. The active layer most often consists of quantum wells, which provide lower threshold current and higher efficiency.|$|E

Low {{to medium}} power <b>laser</b> <b>diodes</b> {{are used in}} laser pointers, laser printers and CD/DVD players. <b>Laser</b> <b>diodes</b> are also frequently used to optically pump other lasers with high efficiency. The highest power industrial <b>laser</b> <b>diodes,</b> with power up to 10 kW (70 dBm), are used in industry for cutting and welding. External-cavity semiconductor lasers have a semiconductor active medium in a larger cavity.

25|$|It {{is often}} {{necessary}} to align an optical fiber with another optical fiber, or with an optoelectronic device {{such as a}} light-emitting diode, a <b>laser</b> <b>diode,</b> or a modulator. This can involve either carefully aligning the fiber and placing it {{in contact with the}} device, or can use a lens to allow coupling over an air gap. Typically the size of the fiber mode is much larger than the size of the mode in a <b>laser</b> <b>diode</b> or a silicon optical chip. In this case a tapered or lensed fiber is used to match the fiber mode field distribution to that of the other element. The lens {{on the end of the}} fiber can be formed using polishing, laser cutting or fusion splicing.|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used optical transmitters are semiconductor devices such as light-emitting <b>diodes</b> (LEDs) and <b>laser</b> <b>diodes.</b> The difference between LEDs and <b>laser</b> <b>diodes</b> is that LEDs produce incoherent light, while <b>laser</b> <b>diodes</b> produce coherent light.

40|$|Abstract. The {{advantages}} of AlInGaN as a blocking layer on {{the influence of}} violet InGaN <b>laser</b> <b>diodes</b> have been simulated, these results showed that the temperature characteristic (T 0) of the violet InGaN <b>laser</b> <b>diodes</b> with AlInGaN blocking layer is lower than the T 0 of the violet InGaN <b>laser</b> <b>diodes</b> with AlGaN blocking layer. These phenomenons are due to the improvement of electronics and holes distribution in the quantum wells with using AlInGaN blocking layer. Simulation results also showed that most optical characteristics of the violet InGaN <b>laser</b> <b>diodes</b> can be enhanced by using the AlInGaN blocking layer instead of the AlGaN blocking layer.

25|$|Many of the {{advances}} in reliability of diode lasers {{in the last}} 20 years remain proprietary to their developers. The reliability of a <b>laser</b> <b>diode</b> {{can make or break}} a product line. Moreover, reverse engineering is not always able to reveal the differences between more-reliable and less-reliable diode laser products.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem with}} the simple quantum well diode {{described}} above is that the thin layer is simply too small to effectively confine the light. To compensate, another two layers are added on, outside the first three. These layers have a lower refractive index than the centre layers, and hence confine the light effectively. Such a design is called a separate confinement heterostructure (SCH) <b>laser</b> <b>diode.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{emergence}} of high definition players followed {{the entry of}} HDTV televisions into the mainstream market in the mid-2000s. Consumer-grade high definition players required an inexpensive storage medium capable of holding the larger amount of data needed for HD video.

40|$|With {{this paper}} we {{describe}} recent {{results on the}} physical mechanisms responsible for the gradual degradation of GaN-based <b>laser</b> <b>diodes</b> and Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs). The results described in the following were obtained {{by means of an}} extensive electrical and optical characterization of <b>laser</b> <b>diodes</b> and LEDs submitted to accelerated stress conditions. The experimental evidence described within this paper demonstrate that: (i) during stress, the threshold current of <b>laser</b> <b>diodes</b> can significantly increase, possibly due to a diffusion-related process; (ii) slope efficiency of <b>laser</b> <b>diodes</b> does not significantly change as a consequence of stress; (iii) LED samples - with the same epitaxial structure of <b>laser</b> <b>diodes</b> - show a significant decrease in optical power during stress time; degradation is more prominent at low measuring current levels, suggesting that it is due to the increase in non-radiative recombination; (iv) the worsening of the optical characteristics of LEDs and <b>laser</b> <b>diodes</b> is significantly correlated to the increase in the defect-related current components. Results described within this paper strongly support the hypothesis that the degradation of <b>laser</b> <b>diodes</b> and LEDs submitted to stress at high current densities (> 4 kA/cm 2) is due to the increase in the concentration of defects within the active layer of the devices, activated by the high flux of accelerated carriers through the quantum-well region...|$|R

25|$|Semiconductor optical {{amplifiers}} (SOAs) are amplifiers {{which use}} a semiconductor {{to provide the}} gain medium. These amplifiers have a similar structure to Fabry–Pérot laser diodes but with anti-reflection design elements at the end faces. Recent designs include anti-reflective coatings and tilted wave guide and window regions which can reduce end face reflection to less than 0.001%. Since this creates a loss of power from the cavity which {{is greater than the}} gain, it prevents the amplifier from acting as a laser. Another type of SOA consists of two regions.
