25|$|Vandana Shiva, an Indian anti-GMO activist, {{argued the}} problem was not the plant per se, but {{potential}} problems with poverty and loss of biodiversity. Shiva claimed these problems could be amplified by the corporate control of agriculture.

Other groups argued that a varied diet containing foods rich in beta carotene such as sweet potato, <b>leaf</b> <b>vegetables</b> and fruit would provide children with sufficient vitamin A. Keith West of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health has stated that foodstuffs containing vitamin A are often unavailable, only available at certain seasons, or too expensive for poor families in underdeveloped countries.|$|E
