The {{research}} data were the results of a study of an early reading-writing curriculum, those of a survey on the implementation of and suggestions for the <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> early reading-writing at elementary schools, and those of a tryout of the prototype of a model for the <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> early reading-writing. The study produced: (1) a model of a guideline for the <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> early reading-writing divided into the essence of early reading-writing and strategies in the <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> early readingwriting in the emergent literacy perspective and (2) a model of an early reading-writing magazine using the performance standard with language characteristics, contents, and techniques...|$|R
40|$|The studies {{reported}} here used an interference paradigm {{to determine whether}} a long-term consolidation process (i. e., one lasting from several hours to days) occurs in the <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> two implicit motor skills, <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> a movement sequence and <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> a visuo-motor mapping. Subjects learned one skill and were tested on that skill 48 h later. Between the learning session and test session, some subjects trained on a second skill. The amount of time between the <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> the two skills varied for different subjects. In both the <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> a movement sequence and the <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> a visuo-motor mapping, we found that remote memories were susceptible to interference, but the passage of time did not afford protection from interference. These results are inconsistent with the long-term consolidation of these motor skills. A possible difference between these tasks and those that do show long-term consolidation is that the present tasks are not dynamic motor skills...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> methods and critical thinking skills toward the students’ outcomes in the <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> history. This research is quantitative research using treatment design by level 2 x 2. The research data was taken from the observation, tests and questionnaires. The results showed that (1) <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> the history’s outcomes of students using investigative group learning are better than <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> the history’s outcomes using conventional teaching methods, (2) there is interaction between learning method and critical thinking ability toward <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> the history’s outcomes <b>of</b> students; (3) <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> the history’s outcomes <b>of</b> students using <b>learning</b> methods investigation group with high critical thinking skills are better than learners who learn using conventional learning methods, (4) <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> the history’s outcomes of students using conventional teaching methods with low critical thinking skills are better than students using the investigative group learning method with the ability to think critically low.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{focuses on}} {{inductive}} <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> recursive logical theories from {{a set of}} examples. This is a complex task where the <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> one predicate definition should be interleaved with the <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> the other ones in order to discover predicate dependencies. To overcome this problem we propose {{a variant of the}} separate-and-conquer strategy based on parallel <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> different predicate definitions. In order to improve its efficiency, optimization techniques are investigated and adopted solutions are described. In particular, two caching strategies have been implemented and tested on document processing datasets. Experimental results are discussed and conclusions are drawn. ...|$|R
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{compared the}} <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> lower-dimensional family resemblance categories (4 dimensions) with the <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> higher-dimensional ones (8 dimensions). Category-learning models incorporating error-driven learning, hypothesis testing, or limited capacity attention predict that additional dimensions should either increase learning difficulty or decrease <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> individual features. Contrary to these predictions, the experiments showed no slower <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> high-dimensional categories; instead, subjects learned more features from high-dimensional categories than from low-dimensional categories. This result obtained both in standard learning with feedback and in noncontingent, observational learning. These {{results show that}} rather than interfering with learning, categories with more dimensions cause individuals to learn more. The authors contrast the <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> family resemblance categories with learning in classical conditioning and probability learning paradigms, in which competition among features is well documented...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} learnability of several {{fundamental}} concept {{classes in the}} agnostic <b>learning</b> framework <b>of</b> Haussler [Hau 92] and Kearns et al. [KSS 94]. We show that under the uniform distribution, agnostically learning parities reduces to learning parities with random classification noise, {{commonly referred to as}} the noisy parity problem. Together with the parity <b>learning</b> algorithm <b>of</b> Blum et al. [BKW 03], this gives the first nontrivial algorithm for agnostic <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> parities. We use similar techniques to reduce <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> two other fundamental concept classes under the uniform distribution to <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> noisy parities. Namely, we show that <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> DNF expressions reduces to <b>learning</b> noisy parities <b>of</b> just logarithmic number <b>of</b> variables and <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> k-juntas reduces to <b>learning</b> noisy parities <b>of</b> k variables. We give essentially optimal hardness results for agnostic <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> monomials over { 0, 1 } n and halfspaces over Q n. We show that for any constant ɛ finding a monomial (halfspace) that agrees with an unknown function on 1 / 2 + ɛ fraction of examples is NP-hard even when there exists a monomial (halfspace) that agrees with the unknown function on 1 − ɛ fraction of examples. This resolves an open question due to Blum and significantly improves on a number of previous hardness results for these problems. We extend thes...|$|R
