40|$|Compression seals {{based on}} metal/mica {{composites}} were investigated under solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operating conditions. Since a compressive force {{has to be}} permanently applied in this sealing concept, the mechanical properties of the sealing materials and the SOFC components also became important for maintaining gas tightness. <b>Leakage</b> <b>tests</b> with a sandwich arrangement of mica paper and embossed metallic profiles show leak rates of < 1 x 10 (- 4) mbar l/mm s under an applied normalized compressive load of 2. 7 N/mm (0. 7 MPa). Also under thermal cycles between ambient temperature and 800 degreesC this leak rate does not change due to the elastic response of the seal. Compression tests with the seals in contact with SOFC membranes reveal no damage to the membranes. First results of <b>leakage</b> <b>tests</b> with SOFC stacks are presented, which {{may serve as a}} reference for future <b>leakage</b> <b>tests</b> of alternative sealing systems.

This study included 30 patients who received elective liver resection. Both the conventional bile <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> (injecting an isotonic sodium chloride solution through the cystic duct) and the White test (injecting a fat emulsion solution through the cystic duct) were carried out in the same patients. The detection of bile leakage was compared between the conventional method and the White test. A bile leak was demonstrated in 8 patients (26. 7 %) by the conventional method and in 19 patients (63. 3 %) by the White test. In addition, the White test detected a significantly higher number of bile leakage sites compared with the conventional method (Wilcoxon signed-rank test; < 0. 001). The White test {{is better than the}} conventional test for the intraoperative detection of bile leakage. Based on our study, we recommend that surgeons investigating bile leakage sites during liver resections should use the White test instead of the conventional bile <b>leakage</b> <b>test...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractConfirmation {{of virus}} filter {{integrity}} {{is crucial for}} ensuring the safety of biological products. Two main types of virus filter defects may produce inconsistent and undesirable performance in virus removal: improper pore-size distribution across the membrane; and specific damage, such as tears, broken fibers, or pinholes. Two integrity tests are performed on each individual filter manufactured by Asahi Kasei Medical to ensure the absence of these defects prior to shipment. In this study, we verified that typical usage of Planova™ BioEX filters would not improperly shift the pore-size distribution. Damage occurring during shipment and use (e. g., broken fibers or pinholes) can be detected by end-users with sufficient sensitivity using air–water diffusion based <b>leakage</b> <b>tests.</b> We prepared and tested filters with model pinhole defects of various sizes to develop standard acceptance criteria for the <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> relative to porcine parvovirus infectivity logarithmic reduction values (LRVs). Our results demonstrate that pinhole defects at or below a certain size for each effective filter surface area have no {{significant impact on the}} virus LRV. In conclusion the <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> is sufficiently sensitive to serve as the sole end-user integrity test for Planova™ BioEX filters, facilitating their use in biopharmaceuticals manufacturing...|$|R

Methods: Patients were randomized to undergo intraoperative bile <b>leakage</b> <b>tests</b> with saline then fat emulsion (Group A), or fat emulsion then saline (Group B). All patients received both tests. Results: In group A (n 64), saline revealed 53 leakage points in 27 patients, and fat emulsion revealed 42 additional points in a further nine patients. In group B (n 64), fat emulsion revealed 87 leakage points in 37 patients, and saline revealed three additional points in three patients. There were no significant between-group differences in the number of leakage points detected by the first test, total number of leakage points or postoperative complications. Significantly more leakage points were detected by the second test in Group A (fat emulsion) than in Group B (saline). Conclusions: Fat emulsion then saline identifies more leakage points after the first test than saline then fat emulsion.

40|$|For {{the first}} time, {{this study used}} 5 - (6 -) sulfofluorescein diacetate (SFDA), a {{fluorescent}} product in plant cells converted by esterase activity to fluorescein- 5 - (and 6 -) sulfonic acid (FSA), to assess the freezing tolerance of leaf cells. We were able to readily distinguish living and dead cells, and detect differences in freezing tolerance among five alpine plants using the SFDA-staining method. We also compared this method with two conventional methods, the electrolyte <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> and fluorescein diacetate (FDA) staining method. The electrolyte <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> often over- or underestimated freezing injury.

5000|$|A basic duct <b>leakage</b> <b>testing</b> system {{includes}} three components: a calibrated fan, a register sealing system, and {{a device to}} measure fan flow and building pressure. Supply registers or return air grills are sealed using adhesive tapes, cardboard, or non-adhesive reusable seals. One register or return is left unsealed, and the calibrated fan is connected to it. Pressure is monitored {{in one of the}} branches of the ductwork while the calibrated fan delivers air into the system. As air is delivered into the ductwork, pressure builds and forces air out of all of the openings in the various ductwork connections or through the seams and joints of the furnace or air-conditioner. The tighter the ductwork system (e.g. fewer holes), the less air is needed from the fan to create a change in the ductwork pressure.|$|E
