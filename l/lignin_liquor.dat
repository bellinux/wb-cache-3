40|$|Abstract. This paper {{analyzes}} the delignification mechanism of wheat straw pulping process. The lignin removal of pulping process {{is left in}} black liquor. The higher the black <b>liquor</b> <b>lignin</b> content is, the bigger the lignin of paper pulp is removed. The relations of black <b>liquor</b> <b>lignin</b> content and alkali concentration to pulping time are described in detail. The results show that delignification process {{is divided into two}} stages: quick and slow stage. The lignin removal rate in the first stage is much higher than the second, that is, lignin has been removed more sufficiently after quick stage. In first stage, reaction order of delignification is 1. 0, and 0. 7 with respect to OH-, the activation energy is 38. 62 kJ • mol- 1. The latter delignification also belongs to the first-order reaction and 4. 4 with respect to OH-, the activation energy is 75. 56 kJ • mol- 1.

Lignin was removed from a Softwood kraft black liquor and four different black liquors were studied; one reference black <b>liquor</b> (with no <b>lignin</b> extracted), two <b>lignin</b> lean black <b>liquors</b> with a <b>lignin</b> removal rate of 5. 5 % and 21 % respectively and finally one <b>liquor</b> with maximum <b>lignin</b> removal of 60 %. Evaporation tests were carried out at the research evaporator in Chalmers University of Technology. Studied parameters were liquor viscosity, boiling point rise, heat transfer coefficient, scaling propensity, changes in liquor chemical composition and tube incrustation. It was found that the solubility limit for incrustation changed towards lower dry solids for the <b>lignin</b> lean black <b>liquors</b> due to an increased salt content. The scaling obtained on the tubes was easily cleaned with thin liquor at 105 °C. It was also shown that the liquor viscosity decreased exponentially with increased lignin outtake and hence, the heat transfer coefficient increased with increased lignin outtake. Long term tests, operated about 6 percentage dry solids units above the solubility limit for incrustation for all liquors, showed that the heat transfer coefficient increased from 650 W/m 2 K for the reference liquor to 1500 W/m 2 K for the <b>liquor</b> with highest <b>lignin</b> separation degree, 60 %...|$|R

During the course of the study, it became clear that the production of brown rot lignin had a limited success. Since brown rot lignin could not be obtained in sufficient quantity and purity by a bioconversion method, other alternative lignin production methods, as well as commercially available lignin, were chosen; namely production of <b>lignin</b> from black <b>liquor</b> and Alcell® (organosolv) lignin.

This is enough electricity to power a 3-bedroom European house for an entire year, or enough energy to heat and air-condition the average North American home for almost six months.

The conversion is supposed {{to take place in}} a high pressure and temperature reactor at near supercritical water conditions. A pilot scale autoclave station, acquired for this purpose, has been evaluated considering the heat transfer in three different units; the storage tank, the preheater and the reactor. Experiments with water have been carried out at different pressures and temperatures near the supercritical region. The temperatures of the heaters and the corresponding heated units have been measured and the results have been evaluated with mathematical models for the heat transfer. Heat transfer coefficients have been calculated both theoretically and experimentally. A difference between the theoretical and experimental overall heat transfer coefficient was found for the preheater. This difference has been investigated and the most likely cause is a small passage of air in the preheater which reduces the heat transfer from the preheater material to the water pipe. The water experiments showed that the heaters can supply enough heat to reach water temperatures near the supercritical point. Pump trials with lignin slurry at different lignin concentrations have been conducted. Slurries at higher concentrations than 10 wt% lignin could not be pumped easily with the current pump components.

Besides alkali lignin, the sodium salts are also the basic component of black liquor; they exist in two main forms: as phenolic sodium (-CONa) and carboxylate sodium (-COONa) groups forming a part of alkali lignin or as dissolved salts (NaOH and Na 2 CO 3). In this paper, the influences of these dissolved salts on the pyrolysis and gasification characteristics of alkali lignin were discussed. Five lignin samples, including pure acid precipitated lignin, 10 % and 60 % NaOH-loaded lignin, 10 % and 60 % Na 2 CO 3 -loaded <b>lignin,</b> and black <b>liquor</b> solids were selected as the testing samples. Following experimental research on the evolution patterns of volatile products were carried Out on a thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. The experimental data indicated that the pyrolysis and gasification reaction of alkali lignin could be catalyzed by NaOH and Na 2 CO 3. In the pyrolysis stage, the maximum mass loss rate decreased with increasing amount of NaOH and Na 2 CO 3 additives, while in the gasification stage it increased. In the gasification stage, {{the temperature of the}} maximum mass loss rate shifted to lower value with increasing amount of NaOH and Na 2 CO 3 additives, but did not significantly change in the pyrolysis stage.

30|$|Most {{research}} related to lignin deals with the kraft <b>lignin</b> or black <b>liquor</b> of paper industry. Many other types of lignin were also designated as having dark black appearance. This is solely due to the self condensation of various functional groups of lignin macromolecules during separation from the lignocellulosic matrix. However, compared with polysaccharides, cellulose and hemicellulose, the effective use of lignin has not been progressed owing to the difficult separation of lignin from the other components of wood without their denaturation. The limited use of lignin compared to cellulose is attributable to its molecular structure; i.e. the lignin molecule lacks stereo-regularity and the repeating units of the polymer chain are heterogeneous. Also, lignin in wood forms interpenetrating polymer units with cellulose. Hence, using conventional methods, strong reagents are necessary to separate hydrophobic lignin from hydrophilic cellulose which results in the condensation of lignin on itself giving complicated molecular networks.|$|R

New {{technique}} {{has been used}} to extract of lignin by adding carboxylic acid derivates and organic solvent to precipitate and extract <b>lignin</b> from black <b>liquor</b> (pulp wastewater). Through this new treatment process, new carboxylate which is decomposed to carbondioxide, water and metal oxide at the high temperature was formed. The process of using organic carboxylic acid and organic solvent to precipitate and extract lignin is low-cost and can not cause second pollution. The lignin obtained through this new process is water insoluble and thermoplastic. Its weigh average molecular weight, purity, and glass transition temperature are higher than 2000, 90 % and 150 °C, respectively. Through the methods of thermoplastic modification, the thermoplastic properties for high purity lignin-based composite materials are improved significantly. Its melt flow ratio, tensile strength and elongation at break are 0. 73 g/ 10 min, 11. 8 MPa, and 21 %, respectively. Thermoplastic lignin-based composite materials have good processing properties as well as synthetic polymers for extruding, injection molding, and blowing processes. Lignin, as a kind of natural thermoplastic polymers with good processing properties, can be carried out to process for film, foam, and thermoplastic composite...|$|R
40|$|A hybrid porous {{adsorbent}} {{was produced}} by mixing black <b>liquor</b> <b>lignin</b> (BL) with basic oxygen furnace steelmaking slag (SS) followed by carbonization at 860 °C for removal of trace sulfur dioxide (SO 2) from air. The effects of BL percentage, carbonization temperature, carbonization duration and the binary combined effect of each individual process parameter on the removal of SO 2 have been statistically analyzed. The optimal preparation conditions were 48 %[*]=[*]BL/(BL[*]+[*]SS), carbonized at 860 °C for 50 minutes (labeled BL-SS- 48 - 860 - 50). The crystallite CaO and MgO phases remained in the hybrid matrix. A carbonization temperature over 800 °C facilitated gasification reaction between the carbon matrix and the CO 2 emitted from the decomposition of calcium and magnesium carbonate, {{which led to the}} pore formation and enlargement in the carbon matrix. The prepared hybrid adsorbent showed good SO 2 removal performance. The kinetic model demonstrated satisfying results in predicting SO 2 adsorption kinetics with good prediction within a relative large range of SO 2 inlet concentration. The mass transfer coefficient k[*]=[*] 537 (s− 1) was obtained by fitting the model to the experimental breakthrough curve...|$|R
40|$|Lignin {{from wood}} {{is by far}} the largest source of {{bio-based}} aromatic raw material. Today a vast amount of lignin is processes and incinerated in kraft pulp mills around the world. One possible option to utilize the energy surplus in a modern kraft pulp mill is to extract <b>lignin</b> from black <b>liquor.</b> Precipitation of <b>lignin</b> is one important step in an extraction process. This study investigates how the molecular size and functional groups of lignin influenced the precipitation yield. Cross-flow filtration was applied to fractionate lignin with different molecular weights from a black liquor, precipitation studies was made on the different fractions. The precipitated lignin was characterized by GPC, HPAEC-PAD and NMR analysis. The results show {{that it was possible to}} obtain a more homogenous lignin by fractionation using cross-flow filtration. It was found that the molecular properties of kraft lignin, i. e. molecular weight and functional groups, influenced the yield of lignin precipitation: at the same precipitation condition, lignin fraction with higher molecular weight has higher precipitation yield. Lignin fraction with lower molecular weight contains less amount of carbohydrates and methoxyl groups but higher amount of phenolic groups...|$|R
40|$|Removing <b>lignin</b> {{from black}} <b>liquor</b> {{is one way}} of {{recovering}} valuable organic substances for alternative use as well as reducing the energy surplus in a modern, energy-optimised kraft pulp mill. By using the recently developed "LignoBoost" process it is possible to upgrade black liquor streams of different origin to form valuable chemicals. In this investigation a combination of membrane filtration and the LignoBoost concept was used. The primary objective of the work was to investigate whether or not the filtration properties of the black liquor were affected by its hemicellulose content. The hemicellulose content in the black liquors was lowered prior to precipitation using three different pre-treatment techniques, and the filtration properties were compared to the reference black liquors of evaporated softwood and hardwood black liquor. The pre-treatment methods used were heat-treatment, ultrafiltration and a combination of ultrafiltration and nanofiltration. It was shown that the filtration resistance was lowered considerably when the hemicellulose content in the black liquor was reduced prior to precipitation. The experiments also showed {{that it was possible to}} produce a hardwood lignin product of high purity i. e. low sodium (0. 2 w-% of TIDS) and hemicellulose content (0. 7 w-% of TDS...|$|R
40|$|Removing lignin from kraft {{black liquor}} affects the physico-chemical {{properties}} of the liquor. The viscosity and boiling point elevation of black liquor are of crucial importance to the design {{as well as the}} operation of the black liquor evaporation plant. Since these properties are strongly influenced by the composition of the black liquor, it is of great interest to understand how they are influenced by the removal of <b>lignin</b> from black <b>liquor.</b> The viscosity and boiling point of black liquor samples taken both before and after lignin removal runs, and a mixture thereof, have therefore been measured in this work. Six different original black liquors (softwood and hardwood) were used as the source for lignin removal runs; a total of 18 <b>liquors</b> of different <b>lignin</b> concentration were studied. It was found that the property of black liquor that was most affected by the removal of lignin was viscosity, at most it was reduced by an order of magnitude (depending on the dry content, mill and wood species). A decrease in boiling point elevation was also found at dry contents above 40 - 50 % when a fraction of the lignin was removed from the black liquor...|$|R
40|$|A {{common goal}} in {{present and future}} forestry, {{biofuels}} and biomaterials practices, {{is the need to}} valorize lignocellulose processes to maximize value and optimize autonomic economy. Consequently, a key focus of modern biorefining is the on-site utilization of all residual materials generating products of the highest possible value. The LignoBoost process, recently demonstrated on the pilot-scale at Kraft pulp mills, injects CO(2) into pulping liquors which results in a lower solution pH and thereby precipitates lignin. The present paper compares and evaluates the pyrolysis of pulping <b>liquor</b> <b>lignins</b> precipitated by sulfuric acid (pH 3) and the aforementioned CO(2) method (pH 10. 5 and 9. 5). The CO(2) based process yielded lignin that showed superior pyrolysis properties including low gas formation and increased bio-oil yields, close to 40 %, consisting primarily of low (similar to 150 g mol(- 1)) molecular weight compounds. Subsequent NMR analysis showed that the oils exhibit favorable changes in functionalities, e. g. loss of aromatic and gain in aliphatic carbon percentages as well as decrease in carboxyl and methoxyl (oxygen containing) groups. Moreover, NMR results further confirmed previously hypothesized lignin pyrolysis reactions, {{while at the same time}} showed the potential of CO(2) precipitated lignin for pyrolysis and subsequent liquid biofuel production...|$|R
40|$|An {{increase}} {{in the production of}} pulp is of economic interest to many kraft pulp mills. However, significant increases in production generally require the recovery boiler to be debottlenecked: it must either be rebuilt or replaced. Both options require costly investments that can be avoided by extracting lignin from the black liquor before it is burnt in the boiler. This, in turn, requires changes being made in the evaporation plant. In the present study, simulations have been carried out based on a 25 % {{increase in}} the production of pulp. The evaporation plants are simulated with and without an integrated lignin separation plant to investigate the consequences of extracting <b>lignin</b> from black <b>liquor.</b> The results show that the evaporation plants with lignin extraction have investment costs that are 5 - 30 % higher than an equivalent plant without lignin extraction. Furthermore, the evaporation plants with lignin extraction require an evaporation capacity that is 7 % higher, since filtrates from the lignin separation plant are also evaporated here. This increases the steam demand by 9 - 12 % compared with a plant without lignin extraction. The span in the investment cost and steam demand depends on where the filtrates are recirculated in the evaporation plant...|$|R
