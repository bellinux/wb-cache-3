5|$|The TNA Women's Knockout Championship was {{defended by}} Awesome Kong, who was {{accompanied}} by Raisha Saeed, against ODB in a match lasting six minutes and fifty-four seconds. During the match, Kong was positioned {{on the top of}} a padded turnbuckle which allowed ODB to <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> off and perform a powerbomb gaining a near-fall. Afterwards, Saeed stood on the ring apron to distract ODB, allowing Kong to perform her signature Awesome Bomb maneuver and gain the pinfall to retain the TNA Women's Knockout Championship.|$|E
5|$|The bow {{section was}} badly damaged, but not irreparably so, {{and the rest}} of the ship, {{including}} the boilers and engines, were not damaged at all. It was determined that if the ship could be lightened, the tide would then <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> off the bottom and she could be sailed to port. With this in mind, three days later, on 20 March, the cargo was unloaded into small coastal freighters. Initially, it appeared that the attempt would succeed, but a week later, after various other vessels had attempted to pull Suevic off the rocks, the weather deteriorated, and waves drove her farther onto shore, from whence she could not be moved.|$|E

50|$|The {{scene where}} Ronald Elster grabs Bunky {{by the throat}} and <b>lifts</b> <b>her</b> off the floor was done without any special effect. Erland Van Lidth (Elster) was an {{incredible}} weight lifter and actually seized Carol Levy by the neck and <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> for the shot.|$|R

5|$|Despite some claims, {{such as that}} by the {{historian}} Max von Boehm, that the largest crinolines measured up to ten yards (30feet) around, the photohistorian Alison Gernsheim concluded that the maximum realistic circumference was in fact between five-and-a-half and six yards. Whilst a loosely gathered skirt draped over a large hoop would certainly require a higher yardage, Gernsheim noted that ten yard hems were highly improbable. Staged photographs showing women wearing exaggeratedly large crinolines were quite popular, such as a widely published sequence of five stereoscope views showing a woman dressing {{with the assistance of}} several maids who require long poles to <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> dress over her head and other ingenious means of navigating her enormous hoopskirt. Such photographs, which re-enacted contemporary caricatures rather than accurately reflecting reality, were aimed towards the voyeur's market. However, it was a fact that the size of the crinoline often caused difficulties in passing through doors, boarding carriages and generally moving about. By the late 1860s many crinolines were of a significantly reduced size, as noted by a Victoria and Albert Museum curator observing the sizes of cage crinolines in the Museum's collection.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Victoria {{had written}} {{instructions}} for her funeral, {{which was to}} be military as befitting a soldier's daughter {{and the head of the}} army, and white instead of black. On 25 January, Edward VII, the Kaiser and Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, helped <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> body into the coffin. She was dressed in a white dress and her wedding veil. An array of mementos commemorating her extended family, friends and servants were laid in the coffin with her, at her request, by her doctor and dressers. One of Albert's dressing gowns was placed by her side, with a plaster cast of his hand, while a lock of John Brown's hair, along with a picture of him, was placed in her left hand concealed from the view of the family by a carefully positioned bunch of flowers. Items of jewellery placed on Victoria included the wedding ring of John Brown's mother, given to her by Brown in 1883. Her funeral was held on Saturday 2 February, in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and after two days of lying-in-state, she was interred beside Prince Albert in Frogmore Mausoleum at Windsor Great Park.|$|E
5|$|Lisa {{learns that}} Derek and Sharon {{will be going}} away from town for a few days, with Sharon leaving one {{afternoon}} and Derek the next day. While Sharon is {{on her way to}} pick up Kyle, she realizes she forgot to set the alarm system and returns home. Meanwhile, Lisa breaks into Derek and Sharon's house again and decorates the master bed with rose petals. While setting the alarm, Sharon hears Lisa in the bedroom. She confronts Lisa, who tries to convince her that Derek was seeing Lisa. However, Sharon sees through her lie and attempts to call the police, but Lisa tackles her to the floor, and the two engage in a fistfight. Derek calls the home phone and Lisa answers; he calls Detective Reese and they both head toward the house. Lisa runs to the attic and Sharon pursues her. Sharon leads her to a weak spot in the attic floor, where Lisa falls through. Seeing that Lisa is in mortal danger, Sharon reaches out in an attempt to grab Lisa and <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> up, but Lisa refuses and tries to pull Sharon down with her. Seeing that the floor is beginning to buckle, Sharon pries Lisa off of her arm. Lisa falls and smashes onto the glass table below. A chandelier falls from the ceiling onto Lisa, eventually killing her. Detective Reese arrives as Sharon comes out of the house. As soon as Detective Reese goes inside the house to investigate Lisa's actions, Derek soon arrives; he and Sharon then tearfully embrace one another.|$|E

25|$|Nothing about a {{personal}} connection between Gertrude Lawrence and Daphne du Maurier was published during Lawrence's lifetime. Two years after Lawrence's death, her widower Richard Aldrich {{had this to}} say in a best-selling biography of his late wife, Gertrude Lawrence as Mrs. A.:All her ingenuous traits, which could be annoying as well as endearing, would be swept away by her courage, her clear perception of truth, and the divine compassion which could flood her heart and <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> to the heights of nobility.|$|E
25|$|Pippi is red-haired, freckled, {{unconventional}} and superhumanly strong – able to <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> horse one-handed. She is {{playful and}} unpredictable. She often {{makes fun of}} unreasonable adults, {{especially if they are}} pompous and condescending. Her anger comes out in extreme cases, such as when a man ill-treats his horse. Pippi, like Peter Pan, does not want to grow up. She is the daughter of a buccaneer captain and has adventure stories to tell about that too. Her four best friends are her horse and monkey, and the neighbours' children, Tommy and Annika.|$|E

25|$|Charwell was {{commissioned}} in April 1803 under Commander Phillip Dumaresq. In early May Charwell {{was in the}} Hamoaze completely rigged and fitted for sea, but was short a crew. Once he had succeeded in forming a crew, Dumaresque sailed her in the Channel. However, by 1 September {{she was back in}} the Hamoaze. She had grounded on some rocks on the French coast. There she had had to throw her guns overboard to lighten her sufficiently that the next incoming tide could <b>lift</b> <b>her.</b> At Plymouth {{she was going to have}} some of her copper plates removed to permit inspection of her hull.|$|E
25|$|A pillow or sex pillow (especially a firm one) can be used, {{to alter}} the depth and angle of penetration. A wedge- or ramp-shaped pillow can relieve {{pressure}} on the top person's hands and arms. Placing a pillow under the woman's buttocks can <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> pelvis—a Playboy article suggested placing it under her hips to increase pressure on the clitoris. Each of these methods can increase the depth of penetration. Raising the clitoris generally allows easier access to it in this position. Using a pillow can also help the woman arch her back and avoid backache.|$|E

25|$|Season of the Witch is a 2011 American {{historical}} fantasy adventure film starring Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman {{and directed}} by Dominic Sena with extensive uncredited reshoots by Brett Ratner. Cage and Perlman star as Teutonic Knights, who return from the Crusades to find their fatherland ruined by the Black Death. Two church elders accuse a girl (Claire Foy) of being a witch responsible for the destruction; they command the two knights to transport the girl to a monastery so the monks can <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> curse from the land. The film draws inspiration from the 1957 film The Seventh Seal. It reunited Sena and Cage who had previously worked together on Gone in 60 Seconds.|$|E
25|$|Face {{covering}} veils with caps of otter {{were worn}} {{in the streets}} by women in public in Xinjiang as witnessed by Ahmad Kamal in the 1930s. In order to properly mount her stirrup with her foot, one Turki woman had to temporarily <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> veil to see better. The face of the girl who was to marry Ahmad Kamal was covered by the veil. Nura Han removed her face veil after marring Ahmad Kamal. A cap of otter and a veil was worn by Nura Han. Muslim women faced no risk in Urumqi of being deveiled by the government (hookemet) so Ahmad Kamal wore a face veil and women's attire to escape.|$|E
25|$|Priscilla Tirado was {{too weak}} to grab the line when the {{helicopter}} returned to her. A watching bystander, Congressional Budget Office assistant Lenny Skutnik, stripped off his coat and boots, and in short sleeves, dove into the icy water and swam out to successfully pull her to shore. The helicopter then proceeded to where Felch had fallen, and paramedic Gene Windsor stepped out onto the helicopter skid and grabbed her by the clothing to <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> onto the skid with him, bringing her to shore. When the helicopter crew returned for Williams, the wreckage he was strapped into had rolled slightly, submerging him—according to the coroner, Williams was the only passenger to die by drowning. His body and those of the other occupants were later recovered.|$|E

25|$|Sue grows {{disillusioned with}} cheerleading, {{and in an}} effort to {{recapture}} her love for it, plans to fire cheerleader Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) from a cannon during the team's next competitive routine. Brittany and her friends Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) and Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) ultimately quit the squad, which loses at Regionals after having won the national title for six straight years.

25|$|Grant’s gazelles {{sexually mature}} at 18 months. Territory-holding bucks mate more than ones in {{bachelor}} groups. The courting ritual {{begins with a}} buck following a doe, {{waiting for her to}} urinate. When she does, the male does the Flehmen response to determine if she is in estrus. If she is, he will continue to follow her. The female will <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> tail, signaling she is ready to mate, and the male will mount her. The gestation period for the gazelle lasts for 198 days. Births peak in January and February. A doe will leave her herd and find a well-hidden place to give birth. Afterwards, the female eats the afterbirth and other fluids to keep the fawn clean and scentless. Females that have recently given birth will stay together for protection. The does nurse their fawns four times a day. Fawns are immobile for the first few days, so the mother stays close by. When the fawn can walk, it leaves with its mother to find a herd. Around this time, fawns will associate with one another in peer groups. A gazelle is weaned at six months, but will continue to associate with its mother until adolescence.|$|E
