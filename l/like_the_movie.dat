25|$|In 1954, {{during the}} {{shooting}} of Azaad (1955 film), Meena Kumari and Kamal Amrohi were in South India, and here Kamal Amrohi began outlining the plot of his next film {{with his wife and}} decided to call it 'Pakeezah'. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> its title has a fascinating history too; The title was changed many times due to superstitious reasons, but finally the original stayed. After the failure of Daera in 1953, Pakeezah as an idea, was roaming around in Amrohi's mind. A concept, he said, was irretrievably fixed by his love for his wife. He hoped to create a film which would be worthy of her as an actress, and worthy of the love he felt for her as a woman. Kamal declared that for every line he wrote, he had Meena in mind. He wished to present her on the screen as no one had before: beautiful, sad, sanguine, dejected, calculating, sexy - he ambitioned to capture as many dimensions of her as he knew of.|$|E
500|$|David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle {{found the}} writing not funny, writing {{that he could}} not see [...] "Jon Heder's expressionless face" [...] as he talked in the {{animation}}. The Staten Island Advance said the change to animation freed Napoleon from real-world limitations, but thought it [...] "lessen the overall appeal of the character and setting". Lori Rackl of the Chicago Sun-Times did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> and liked the animated series even less; she thought the emotions and physical humor were lost in the change to animation.|$|E

500|$|Some reviews praised David Hasselhoff's {{appearance}} in the film. Jennifer Frey of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "Getting to see the hairs on Hasselhoff's back (and thighs, and calves) magnified exponentially is perhaps a bit creepy. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> it's all in good fun." [...] Nancy Basile of About.com, who gave the film {{four out of five}} stars, wrote that Hasselhoff [...] "must have a great sense of humor." [...] Cinema Blend founder Joshua Tyler called Hasselhoff's role [...] "the best movie cameo I've seen since Fred Savage stuck a joint in his crotch and played a clarinet to charm the resulting smoke like a snake." ...|$|E

The player plays as {{all three}} orphans at {{points in the}} game, and {{encounters}} characters such as Mr. Poe, Uncle Monty and Aunt Josephine, along with villains such as Count Olaf, the hook-handed man, the white-faced women, and the bald-headed man. The game, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> follows only the first three books in the series. Although never mentioned in the game, there are some references to V.F.D., {{such as in the}} first level where a package is delivered from the [...] "Very Fast Delivery Service."

500|$|The {{technical}} sophistication {{required to}} make modern video games and the high expectations of players {{make it difficult for}} independent developers to impress audiences viscerally, to the degree that large game makers with extensive budgets and development teams are able to, but innovation and quality need not necessarily be stymied. Europe, and Germany in particular, remains more receptive to PC-exclusives and, in general, to older, more [...] "hardcore" [...] design decisions. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> industry, the indie video game scene plays a crucial role in formulating new ideas and concepts that mainstream publishers and marketing departments, stuck in their old ways, might otherwise deem unworkable or too radical. There are many examples that movies that never gained approval with the corporate decision makers were financially successful or became iconic on the film industry. Indie video game developers can provide more development time and effort whereas larger corporate enterprises are constrained by the expenses and expectations of voice-overs and advanced graphics. Independent developers can be successful in focusing on niche markets.|$|E

The game's storyline {{was similar to the}} film's, with a few changes. However, unlike the film, the game received mixed to negative reviews. Aggregating review website GameRankings gave the Nintendo 64 version 54.40%, the PlayStation version 51.90% [...] and the Game Boy Color version 36.63%. GameSpot gave the PlayStation version a 2.7/10, concluding that it was [...] "obvious that Disney was more interested in producing a $40 advertisement for its movie than in developing a playable game." [...] IGN gave the Nintendo 64 version a 6.8/10, praising the presentation and sound by stating [...] "It was upbeat, cheery look and feel very much <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> of the same name with cheery, happy tunes and strong sound effects but again criticised the gameplay by saying the controls were sluggish with stuttering framerate and tired gameplay mechanics". while they gave the PlayStation version a 4/10, criticizing the gameplay as slow and awkward but praising the presentation as cinematic.|$|E

The Wall Street Journals Joe Morgenstern enthusiastically praised both the song and the sequence, hailing the latter as [...] "magical" [...] while describing [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] as a [...] "gleeful variation on theme of 'Whistle While You Work'". Similarly, Todd McCarthy of Variety called [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] "a hilarious variation on 'Whistle While You Work'". Sun Media's Kevin Williamson hailed the musical number {{as one of the}} film's [...] "stand-outs", elaborating, [...] "Happy Working Song a crowd-pleaser." [...] The Mountain Xpress Ken Hanke allotted particular praise to Adams', writing that when the actress is [...] "singing her 'Happy Working Song' with her makeshift 'forest friends'... she is the perfect cartoon heroine made flesh". Kerry Lengel of The Arizona Republic jokingly lauded [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] as [...] "the funniest - and grossest - set piece in the film." [...] Calling the sequence the [...] "film's highlight", Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer commented, [...] "The song, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> is cheerfully gross enough to get boys - and their fathers - into theater seats for a story every tween and her mother will love." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} of Enough wanted Lopez {{to write a}} new song for the film. According to Lopez, writing a song is something that cannot be forced; [...] "It kinda just has to happen". While on their honeymoon in October 2001, Cris Judd played Lopez a melody that he had written on the piano. She thought that the melody was [...] "really beautiful" [...] {{and that it would}} make a [...] "wonderful song". Lopez felt that a [...] "little bit of it sounded <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> a little haunting". When she heard the melody, Lopez said to herself: [...] "I can write something to that right now. And we can use it in Enough". She then began to think about the film and the character that she portrays and what she had been through. In addition, she also thought about the things that she had gone through in her own life. According to Lopez, it was easy to be inspired by the melody Judd had written, [...] "and just kind of that grateful feeling, to just be here [...] And keeping it simple. Because life can get so crazy and everything. And then you realize, it's all just kinda about the simplicity of being here, and being healthy. And being alive. So that's where the song came from." ...|$|E

Simon & Schuster released a second printing of 2 million copies of The Secret â [...] "the biggest order for a second printing in its history," [...] while Time reported brisk sales of the DVD through New Age bookstores, and New Thought churches, such as Unity and Agape International Spiritual Center. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> the book has also experienced a great deal of controversy and criticism for its claims, and has been parodied on several TV shows.|$|E

2500|$|Executives from Universal, {{including}} Lew Wasserman and Sid Sheinberg, {{were not}} very enthusiastic. [...] "I think they were shocked," [...] recalled Spikings. [...] "What really upset them was 'God Bless America'. Sheinberg thought it was anti-American. He was vehement. He said something like 'You're poking a stick {{in the eye of}} America.' They really didn't <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie.</b> And they certainly didn't like it at three hours and two minutes." [...] Deeley wasn't surprised by the Universal response: [...] "The Deer Hunter was a United Artists sort of picture, whereas Convoy was more in the style of Universal. I'd muddled and sold the wrong picture to each studio." [...] Deeley did agree with Universal that the film needed to be shorter, not just because of pacing but also to ensure commercial success. [...] "A picture under {{two and a half hours}} can scrape three shows a day," [...] wrote Deeley, [...] "but at three hours you've lost one third of your screenings and one third of your income for the cinemas, distributors, and profit participants." ...|$|E
2500|$|The video {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, observing the chemistry between Spears and Azalea {{as well as}} praising Spears's dancing and noting a nod to her earlier music videos. Mike Wass for Idolator wrote, [...] "Yes, it lifts product placement to previously unimagined heights and I canât see an Academy Award in either divaâs future â but itâs {{a hell of a}} lot of fun. And just kooky enough to become a cult classic <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> itâs loosely based on". Josh Duboff from Vanity Fair described the video as [...] "entertaining and kind of weird. Thereâs a lot of big hair; Spears does some endearing waving (and generally seems to be having a good time)". He concluded, [...] "Our favorite part is actually probably the tag at the end, where Spears and Azalea are just goofing around in the car; you can imagine Spears turning to Azalea afterwards and squealing, [...] "That was really cool, I had so much fun," [...] and meaning it". Kirthana Ramisetti for New York Daily News similarly noted, [...] "The two music stars seemed to have a lot of fun filming their video".|$|E
2500|$|The Movie Channel Challenge: Running each August from 1990 to 1997, [...] "The Movie Channel Challenge" [...] was a month-long summer {{programming}} stunt â {{inspired by}} the [...] "no-repeat weekends" [...] music playlist stunts used on many radio stations â that featured a lineup of approximately 420 movies, none of which were repeated {{during the course of}} that month. The festival was developed to address a consumer complaint common with premium services <b>like</b> <b>The</b> <b>Movie</b> Channel, in avoiding repeat showings of select films on multiple dates and time slots during the calendar month â effectively quadupling the number of movies that most pay services typically aired in a given month (TMC's film lineup normally averages around 100 movies per month) â and to attract potential subscribers to and increase consumer awareness of TMC (at the time the festival began, The Movie Channel had approximately 2.5 million subscribers, one-third that of sister network Showtime, which had 8.5 million). Individual marathon-style festivals consisting of a set of movies starring a particular actor or focusing on a certain film genre (similar to those later featured as part of the [...] "TMC Marathons/Double Vision Weekends" [...] blocks) would be aired at various points during the period.|$|E
5000|$|Even {{though some}} critics <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> other critics <b>like</b> Geoff Andrews have noted its sexism - [...] "The {{viewpoint}} is predictably phallic: fear/contempt of <b>the</b> female festers <b>like</b> a squeezed pimple; an abortion is shown more lasciviously than any sex.

2500|$|Porter {{also wrote}} for Hollywood in the mid-1930s.

[...] He wrote the score of the short film Paree, Paree, in 1935, {{using some of the}} songs from Fifty Million Frenchmen. Porter also composed the cowboy song [...] "Don't Fence Me In" [...] for Adios, Argentina, an unproduced movie, in 1934, but it did not become a hit until Roy Rogers sang it in the 1944 film Hollywood Canteen. Bing Crosby, The Andrews Sisters, and other artists also popularized it in the 1940s. The Porters moved to Hollywood in December 1935, but Porter's wife did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> environment, and Porter's homosexual peccadillos, formerly very discreet, became less so; she retreated to their Paris house. When his film assignment on Rosalie was finished in 1937, Porter hastened to Paris to make his peace with Linda, but she remained cool. After a walking tour of Europe with his friends, Porter returned to New York in October 1937 without her. They were soon reunited by an accident suffered by Porter.|$|E
2500|$|The series premiered in the U.S. on September 17, 1972, {{and ended}} on February 28, 1983, with the finale, showcased as a {{television}} film, titled [...] "Goodbye, Farewell and Amen", becoming the most-watched and highest-rated single television episode in U.S. television history at the time, with a record-breaking 125 million viewers (60.2 rating and 77 share), according to the New York Times. It had struggled in its first season and was {{at risk of being}} cancelled. Season two of M*A*S*H placed it in a better time slot (airing after the popular All in the Family); the show became one of the top 10 programs of the year and stayed in the top 20 programs for the rest of its run. It is still broadcast in syndication on various television stations. The series, which depicted events occurring during a three-year war, spanned 256 episodes and lasted 11 seasons. [...] The Korean War lasted 1,128 days, meaning each episode of the series would have averaged almost four and a half days of real time. Many of the stories in the early seasons are based on tales told by real MASH surgeons who were interviewed by the production team. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> the series was as much an allegory about the Vietnam War (still in progress when the show began) as it was about the Korean War.|$|E
