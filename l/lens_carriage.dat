40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{is described}} for recording a data input on, a thermally processible storage medium. A light source, whose intensity is modulated {{in response to}} the incoming data input, generates a raster in conformance with incoming timing/control signals so as to expose a latent image of the input information on the storage medium. A rotating drum in conjunction with an incrementally driven <b>lens</b> <b>carriage</b> associated with the laser optical system provides the raster generation. The drum is automatically loaded with the storage medium from a supply means and automatically unloaded to a thermal processor upon completion of recording. The latent image is processed by the controlled application of heat so as to produce an actual displayable image corresponding to the data input at the output of the apparatus...|$|E
5000|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was erected}} on a 1.3 ha rocky island called Pulau Satumu, the southernmost {{island off the}} main island of Singapore. Pulau Satumu means [...] "one tree island" [...] - sa refers to satu ("one") and tumu is the Malay name for the large mangrove tree, Bruguiera confugata. The light source was a wick burner which was replaced in 1905 by a pressurised vapour kerosene mantle burner to increase the light intensity for a greater visible range. A 2nd Order optic was mounted on a roller carriage to allow for smooth rotation. (The Order is a system of classifying the type of lenses used based on the focal length of the <b>lens).</b> This roller <b>carriage</b> was a weight-driven machine {{which had to be}} rewound manually to lift the weight whenever it reached the base. The rewinding was done hourly. A crew of seven men was required to man the lighthouse.|$|R
