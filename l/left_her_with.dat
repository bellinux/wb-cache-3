5|$|Matilda {{achieved}} {{success as}} an author of children's books (using the pen name Susie Sunbeam), beginning in 1849 with A Trap to Catch a Sunbeam, which subsequently went through 42 editions. She married the Rev. Henry Mackarness in 1852, and with him had eleven children, four of whom did not survive infancy. Taking after her father {{in terms of writing}} output, Matilda Mackarness produced an average of one book a year until her death, most of them under her married name. Her husband's death in 1868 <b>left</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> little means of supporting her family, as the books did not produce much income. She and her children moved in with her father.|$|E
5|$|Now aged 23, Matilda {{had only}} limited options {{as to how}} she might {{spend the rest of}} her life. Being childless, she could not {{exercise}} a role as an imperial regent, which <b>left</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> the choice of either becoming a nun or remarrying. Some offers of marriage started to arrive from German princes, but she chose to return to Normandy. She {{does not appear to have}} expected to return to Germany, as she gave up her estates within the Empire and departed with her personal collection of jewels, her own imperial regalia, two of Henry's crowns, and the valuable relic of the Hand of St James the Apostle.|$|E

5|$|In mid-2005, Salzgeber's then-current Grand Prix mount, Wall Street, was euthanized {{following}} {{an episode of}} colic. This, combined with the recent retirement of Rusty, <b>left</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> no Grand Prix-level horses. Wall Street, while a relatively successful dressage horse, had suffered health problems and {{had never been able}} to compete with Rusty as Salzgeber's top horse. In 2008, Salzgeber again began competing at the Grand Prix level on Herzruf's Erbe, who would develop into one of her top international horses. In that year, the pair won the Otto Lorke Prize, given each year to the best German Grand Prix horse under 10 years old. During 2008, Salzgeber and Herzruf's Erbe had won 10 Grand Prix competitions. In 2009, the pair were expected to compete at the European Dressage Championships, but were not chosen for the German team after Herzruf's Erbe sustained an injury at a competition in July. The immediate diagnosis was a severely pulled tendon, although a later diagnosis was that the horse had strained a suspensory muscle, expected to heal in about three months. By early 2010, the horse was again able to be ridden, but was still not in top condition.|$|E
5|$|Nilin reluctantly {{goes along}} with Edge's next plan: to remix the CEO of Memorize, Scylla Cartier-Wells, to make her see the harm her company's {{technology}} is causing. Nilin makes her way into Scylla's office and enters her mind, remixing {{the memory of a}} car crash which <b>left</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> a bitter taste against the world. As she changes the memory to make Scylla a more compassionate person, Nilin discovers that she is Scylla's daughter. Nilin is then told by Edge to head for the Bastille basements to save Bad Request, who has been taken captive. She finds Bad Request, but discovers that his memory has been fully wiped. It is revealed that Memorize scientist Doctor Quaid means to control the Leapers through their Sensens and thus breed a private army for Memorize. However, Johnny Greenteeth, a former co-worker of Quaid's who was experimented on and turned into a Leaper, kills Quaid and prepares to self-destruct the Bastille. Bad Request helps Nilin take down Johnny at the cost of his life and Nilin escapes the destroyed facility.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of widows engaging in independent economic activity. They can be found keeping schools, brewing ale and trading. Some were highly successful, like Janet Flockhart, an Edinburgh wadwife or moneylender, who had been left a widow with seven children after her third husband's suicide, and who managed her business affairs so successfully that she had amassed a moveable estate of £22,000 by her death in the late sixteenth century. The deaths of the two husbands of Mary Erskine (1629–1708) <b>left</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> the resources to become a highly successful business woman and philanthropist, founding the Mary Erskine School and the Trades Maiden Hospital in Edinburgh. Lower down the social scale the rolls of poor relief indicate {{that large numbers of}} widows with children endured a marginal existence and were particularly vulnerable in times of economic hardship. This may in part explain the relatively high rates of remarriage suggested by the available sources. Many widows needed financial security and widowers often needed heirs or a mother for their children. Although contemporary writers seem to have been generally pessimistic about the step-parent relationships that these remarriages created, the evidence of diaries and autobiographies from the period suggest that they were often highly successful, with many children remembering their step-parents with genuine affection.|$|E

25|$|While {{living in}} San Francisco in 1982, Martin was {{involved}} in a traffic accident that <b>left</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> two fractured ribs, a fractured pelvis, and a punctured lung.

25|$|In 1983, after {{filming the}} pilot episode for the {{television}} series Hotel, Davis {{was diagnosed with}} breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy. Within two weeks of her surgery, she suffered four strokes which caused paralysis in the left side of her face and in her left arm, and <b>left</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> slurred speech. She commenced a lengthy period of physical therapy, and aided by her personal assistant, Kathryn Sermak, gained partial recovery from the paralysis.

Obenchain was a Virginia {{native and}} American Civil War veteran who in 1883 became {{president}} of Ogden College, a small men's school in Bowling Green. Lida and William had four children: Margery, William Alexander Jr. (Alex), Thomas Hall and Cecilia (Cecil). Her family responsibilities <b>left</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> limited time to write. Her frustration as an unpaid housewife motivated her to support the cause of women's suffrage {{and to work with}} the Kentucky Equal Rights Association.|$|E
25|$|In Zürich, Davenport saved two match points while {{defeating}} Daniela Hantuchová. The win assured Davenport of recapturing {{the world}} no. 1 ranking from Sharapova the following week. In the final, Davenport defeated sixth seeded Patty Schnyder for her fourth title in Zürich and her sixth title of 2005, {{second only to}} Clijsters's nine. It {{was also the first}} time Davenport had saved match points en route to a victory since the 1999 U.S. Open. The Zürich title <b>left</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> eleven Tier I titles, second among active players.|$|E
25|$|While {{in charge}} of the hospital, Chris Warner (Michael Galvin) hired Tiffany, much to the {{annoyance}} of the other nurses. There was a spark between the two but Tiffany started a romance with Billy (Darren Young) who <b>left</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> hepatitis C following his drug use. Manipulative nurse Carla Crozier (Elizabeth Easther) started to blackmail Tiffany and she soon got back together with Billy and the two got engaged. They broke up and Tiffany got together with Chris. The two married in 1996 and Chris left the country, with the couple starting a long distance romance.|$|E

25|$|Matuschka was mis-diagnosed {{and almost}} died of {{hepatitis}} A in 1968. A near fatal bike accident <b>left</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> many broken bones, a severe back injury and TBI in 1989. Two years later, {{at the age}} of 37, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, undergoing a mastectomy and 6 months of chemotherapy. Matuschka received financial aid from Change, the Robert Rauschenberg Fund, which helps artists facing intense hardships during her injury-related rehabilitation and cancer therapy. In 1991 Matuschka enrolled in the Kushi Institute, Beckett, Mass. and studied macrobiotics with Michio Kushi and Denny Waxman for 10 years.|$|E
25|$|An {{accident}} at sea in late 1798 forced Apollo back to port in Great Yarmouth and <b>left</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> a depleted crew. A capstan pawl, or crossbar, had broken while the crew were raising the anchor, {{and the weight}} of the anchor and chain caused the remaining pawls to turn sharply as the anchor ran back out. Around thirty men were injured after being struck by the pawls. Halkett gave orders for a prompt return to port, where the injured men were discharged from Apollos service and entrusted to local medical care. The ship then put back to sea on 5 January, without replacing the injured crew.|$|E
25|$|The {{marriage}} between Clare and Henry was difficult. Henry was {{by any standard}} extremely successful, but his physical awkwardness, lack of humor, and newsman's discomfort with any conversation that was not strictly factual put him in awe of his beautiful wife's social poise, wit, and fertile imagination. Clare's years as managing editor of Vanity Fair <b>left</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> an avid interest in journalism (she suggested the idea of Life magazine to her husband before it was developed internally). Henry himself was generous in encouraging her to write for Life, {{but the question of}} how much coverage she should be accorded in Time, as she grew more famous, was always a careful balancing act for Henry since {{he did not want to}} be accused of nepotism.|$|E
