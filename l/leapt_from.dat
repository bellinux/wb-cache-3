One day, however, in {{an attempt}} to escape piano lessons so she could play with friends, she <b>leapt</b> <b>from</b> the front porch of her home and cut her foot severely on a broken milk bottle. As a result, she experienced three surgeries to repair the damage. She was unable to attend elementary school or continue with dancing lessons for 18 months.|$|E

25|$|On average, {{unemployment}} rates were slightly {{worse in the}} rest of the nation than in Massachusetts for the first three years of Romney’s term. By his final year in office, the state was struggling to keep pace with the rate of falling unemployment nationwide.

25|$|The East Capitol Street Bridge saw {{its first}} suicide when one-legged 48-year-old Adolphius L. Groom <b>leapt</b> <b>from</b> the bridge {{on the morning}} of July 13, 1967. The first major {{accident}} on the bridge occurred on March 7, 1969, when two vehicles collided head-on on the span, killing two people. Another major crash occurred on September 18, 1971, when a vehicle on the bridge was rear-ended, killing one of the occupants. In October 1977, a man traveling at high speed across the bridge rear-ended another automobile and died. Another suicide occurred on December 16, 1986, when a man <b>leapt</b> <b>from</b> the bridge and landed on a moving vehicle below. Another traffic fatality occurred on the bridge on November 13, 1986, when a driver struck a disabled vehicle on the bridge and was himself rear-ended by a third car. In February 1990, an ambulance taking a patient to the hospital was struck on the bridge by an automobile traveling at about 100mph, leaving the driver and passenger in the vehicle in critical condition.|$|E

He <b>leapt</b> <b>from</b> his hiding place and attacked the beast, which {{took the form of}} Millarca. She fled through the locked door, unharmed. Bertha died immediately afterward.|$|E

Snuka lost several title shots at WWF Champion Bob Backlund, including a steel cage match at Madison Square Garden on June 28, 1982 in which Snuka <b>leapt</b> <b>from</b> the top of the cage, and onto Backlund who managed to escape the cage for the win just seconds prior. The contest was declared Match of the Year by Pro Wrestling Illustrated.|$|E
25|$|The Kennedy {{assassination}} spotlighted the bravery of two Secret Service agents. First, {{an agent}} protecting Mrs. Kennedy, Clint Hill, was {{riding in the}} car directly behind the presidential limousine when the attack began. While the shooting continued, Hill <b>leapt</b> <b>from</b> the running board of the car he was riding on and jumped {{onto the back of}} the President's moving car and guided Mrs. Kennedy from the trunk back into the rear seat of the car. He then shielded the President and the First Lady with his body until the car arrived at the hospital.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the switch}} to English as the only medium of {{instruction}} in schools aided in bridging the social distance between the various groups of ethnic language speakers in the country. Between the early 1960s to the late 1970s, {{the number of students}} registering for primarily English-medium schools <b>leapt</b> <b>from</b> 50% to 90%, as more parents elected {{to send their children to}} English-medium schools. Attendance in Mandarin, Malay and Tamil-medium schools consequently dropped and schools began to close down. The Chinese-medium Nanyang University also made {{the switch to}} English as the medium of instruction despite meeting resistance, especially from the Chinese community.|$|E

At Wimbledon, he had an early loss {{in the second round}} to Tommy Haas. He won five titles in ten finals and was runner-up at the Masters Series tournament in Key Biscayne, losing to Marcelo Ríos, who became world no. 1 as a result. At the year end he was awarded the ATP Most Improved Player of the Year {{for the second time in}} his career (the first being 10 years earlier in 1988).|$|E
25|$|As {{he himself}} {{described}} it {{in a magazine}} article he penned for Nel Cielo, his airfield was attacked by ten enemy bombers. He shot {{down one of the}} bombers in flames at 9AM. He then dueled with another for twenty minutes before it crashed. The observer <b>leapt</b> <b>from</b> the wreckage and lit it on fire to deny its capture. Unfortunately, the observer managed to catch his own clothing on fire in the process. Still more unfortunately, the pilot was still pinned under the debris and burned to death. Meanwhile, Scaroni's squadron-mates shot down six more of the raiders. Scaroni capped off the day by downing another, even larger, bomber at 12:35. He thus ended the year with nine wins.|$|E
25|$|In the Great Migration of the 1920s, major {{populations of}} African-Americans moved to Northern and Midwestern {{cities such as}} Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, Boston, and New York City to pursue jobs in newly {{established}} manufacturing industries; to establish better educational and social opportunities; and to flee racial segregation, Jim Crow Laws, violence and racial bigotry in the Southern states. This wave of migration largely bypassed Los Angeles. In the 1940s, in the Second Great Migration, black Americans migrated to the West Coast in large numbers, in response to defense industry recruitment efforts {{at the start of}} World War II. The black population in Los Angeles <b>leapt</b> <b>from</b> approximately 63,700 in 1940 to about 350,000 in 1965, rising from 4% of LA's population to 14%.|$|E

25|$|Perón {{had mixed}} success in {{expanding}} the country's inadequate electric grid, which grew {{by only one}} fourth during his tenure. Argentina's installed hydroelectric capacity, however, <b>leapt</b> <b>from</b> 45 to 350 MW during his first term (to {{about a fifth of}} the total public grid). He promoted the fossil fuel industry by ordering these resources nationalized, inaugurating Río Turbio (Argentina's only active coal mine), having natural gas flared by the state oil firm YPF captured, and establishing Gas del Estado. The 1949 completion of a gas pipeline between Comodoro Rivadavia and Buenos Aires was another significant accomplishment in this regard. The 1,700km (1,060mi) pipeline allowed natural gas production to rise quickly from 300,000 m3 to 15million m3 daily, making the country self-sufficient in the critical energy staple; the pipeline was, at the time, the longest in the world.|$|E
25|$|On January 2, 1972, Gacy {{picked up}} 16-year-old Timothy Jack McCoy from Chicago's Greyhound bus terminal. Gacy took McCoy—who was {{traveling}} from Michigan to Omaha—on a sightseeing tour of Chicago, and then {{drove him to}} his home with the promise that he could spend the night and be driven back to the station {{in time to catch}} his bus. According to Gacy's later account of the murder, he awoke the following morning to find McCoy standing in his bedroom doorway with a kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy <b>leapt</b> <b>from</b> his bed and McCoy raised both arms in a gesture of surrender, tilting the knife upwards and accidentally cutting Gacy's forearm (Gacy had a scar on his arm to support this account). He then twisted the knife from McCoy's wrist, banged his head against his bedroom wall, kicked him against his wardrobe and walked towards him. McCoy then kicked him in the stomach and Gacy grabbed the youth, wrestled him to the floor, then stabbed him repeatedly in the chest as he straddled him with his body. Gacy claimed he then went to his kitchen and saw an opened carton of eggs and a slab of unsliced bacon on his kitchen table. McCoy had also set the table for two; he had walked into Gacy's room to wake him while absentmindedly carrying the kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy subsequently buried McCoy in his crawl space and later covered the youth's grave with a layer of concrete.|$|E
25|$|Perry {{joined the}} British Army and {{was offered the}} choice of a {{position}} working on chemical warfare or joining the Royal Artillery. He chose artillery, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 5 July 1941. He was posted to Egypt where he arrived in August 1941. Perry's frontline experience in the army was short, as he was captured early in 1942 when his unit was overrun by Rommel's forces as they attempted to slow the German advance from Benghazi. Perry spent the next {{three and a half years}} in various German prisoner-of-war camps, initially in Italy; after the confusion brought by the Italian Armistice, he made his first escape attempt. Breaking through a German cordon he tried to hide his escape by crawling through a wheat field, but was quickly recaptured. Over the next few days he and his fellow prisoners were transported by rail farther north towards German camps. Perry jumped off the moving train at Mantua and made his way on foot to the north of the town. As he approached a bridge, he was recognised by a German guard who had recaptured him only five days earlier in Perry's first escape attempt. Perry was escorted to a commandeered villa in the town and locked in a bathroom until he was able to be transferred again. He spent time in camps in Germany and Silesia before the Russian advance forced his movement west to Brunswick. On the journey he made his third and final escape bid. He and a fellow prisoner cut their way out of a cattle truck and <b>leapt</b> <b>from</b> the moving train. Again he was recaptured, this time by a German patrol. He was then taken to appear before a military court in Hildesheim, where he was court-martialed for damaging a German train, and placed in solitary confinement for a month.|$|E

500|$|Hull was {{promoted}} to flying officer on 16 April 1938. As war loomed, the squadron began to prepare for combat in late 1938, and in December that year was re-equipped with Hawker HurricaneMkIs. Hull reacted to {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War in September 1939 with great excitement; according to Hector Bolitho, No. 43 Squadron's intelligence officer, the Rhodesian <b>leapt</b> <b>from</b> {{one foot to the other}} in the officer's mess, repeating the words [...] "wizard, wizard".|$|E

They then rode to where the battle on the southern side was still going on. On reaching the main column shaken and out of breath, Burnham <b>leapt</b> <b>from</b> his horse and ran to Forbes: [...] "I think I may {{say that we are}} the sole survivors of that party," [...] he quietly confided, before loading his rifle and joining the skirmish.|$|E
