50|$|Trauma shears. Very {{effective}} as a <b>line</b> <b>cutter,</b> with low risk of inadvertent injury or damage. Usually carried in a pocket or special purpose sheath.|$|E
25|$|Cutting {{tools such}} as knives, <b>line</b> <b>cutters</b> or shears are often carried by divers to cut loose from {{entanglement}} in nets or lines.|$|R
50|$|Cutting devices: Sidemount divers, {{particularly}} those operating in overhead environments will carry {{two or more}} cutting devices. These should be stowed {{where they can be}} easily accessed, even when in a tight passage. Popular stowage locations include; a sheath mounted on the harness or lower arm. Redundant/back-up devices may be carried in a pocket. Short bladed knives, trauma shears or emergency <b>line</b> <b>cutters</b> are the most popular selections for primary and back-up cutting tools.|$|R
50|$|Cutting {{tools such}} as knives, <b>line</b> <b>cutters</b> or shears are often carried by divers to cut loose from {{entanglement}} in nets or lines.A surface marker buoy on a line held by the diver indicates {{the position of the}} diver to the surface personnel. This may be an inflatable marker deployed by the diver {{at the end of the}} dive, or a sealed float, towed for the whole dive. A surface marker also allows easy and accurate control of ascent rate and stop depth for safer decompression.|$|R
50|$|Divers {{routinely}} carry a knife, <b>line</b> <b>cutter,</b> scissors or shears to free {{themselves from}} ropes, lines and nets. Lifting bags {{can be used}} to help move heavy objects underwater, but are not carried as standard equipment by most divers.|$|E
5000|$|Diver's net or <b>line</b> <b>cutter.</b> This {{is a small}} {{handheld}} tool {{carried by}} scuba divers to extricate themselves if trapped in fishing net or fishing line. It has a small sharp blade such as a replaceable scalpel blade inside the small notch. There is a small hole {{at the other end}} to for a lanyard to tether the cutter to the diver.|$|E
5000|$|Archers score {{each end}} by summing {{the scores for}} their arrows. An arrow just {{touching}} a scoring boundary line, known as a Line Breaker or <b>Line</b> <b>Cutter,</b> is awarded the higher score. Values scored by each arrow are recorded on a score sheet and must be written in descending order (e.g. if an archer scores 5, 7, 6, 10, 9, 8, this must be recorded as 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5). During and before scoring no one is allowed to touch the arrows. This is so {{that if there is}} disputed arrow score then a judge may be called and the judge makes a ruling on how the arrow lies. The archer in charge of scoring on a target at a tournament is known as the [...] and in larger tournaments, they may be assisted by a a Target Captain makes an initial judgment on all disputed arrows. Under WA rules, in major tournaments, after scoring, each hole is marked before arrows are retrieved. In the event of a [...] "pass through" [...] (the arrow passes straight through the target) or [...] "bouncer" [...] (arrow hits the target and bounces out), points may be awarded to an unmarked hole. Under AGB rules, and in some smaller tournaments, {{in the case of a}} bouncer, the archer must step off the shooting line and hold their bow in the air. A judge then decides whether the archer is permitted to shoot a replacement arrow. If an archer accidentally shoots more arrows than allowed, the highest scoring arrow is not counted and a miss is recorded.|$|E
5000|$|The knife {{is carried}} {{in an open}} sheath on the waist belt {{to the left of}} the crotch strap where it can be reached by either hand and is {{unlikely}} to snag. It is a line cutting tool and does not need to be large or to have a point, but must have a sharp edge that is effective on thin lines and nets. [...] Paramedic shears and purpose designed <b>line</b> <b>cutters</b> can be kept in a wetsuit/ drysuit pocket if there is a high risk of entanglement.|$|R
2500|$|Louis Waldman {{was born}} on January 5, 1891, in Yancherudnia, Ukraine, not far from Kiev, {{the son of a}} Jewish innkeeper {{who was one of the}} few literate men of the village. Waldman emigrated to America in the summer 1909 at the age of 17, {{arriving}} in New York City to join his sisters on September 17. [...] Waldman first worked in a metal shop before becoming an apprentice garment <b>lining</b> <b>cutter</b> in one of the sweatshops of the city. He joined a union and participated in the 11-week New York cloakmakers' strike of 1910, while attending high school in the evenings. Upon conclusion of the strike and resumption of his job, Waldman was fired and blacklisted for carrying out his function as a union representative in supervising the enforcement of the union contract in his shop. Barred from the garment industry, Waldman thereafter worked unsuccessfully as a door-to-door peddler of ribbon before taking a job in a cardboard box factory.|$|R
50|$|The {{recovery}} sequence {{begins with}} {{the operation of the}} high-altitude baroswitch, which triggers the pyrotechnic nose cap thrusters. This ejects the nose cap, which deploys the pilot parachute. Nose cap separation occurs at a nominal altitude of 15704 ft, about 218 seconds after SRB separation. The 11.5 ft diameter conical ribbon pilot parachute provides the force to pull lanyards attached to cut knives, which cut the loop securing the drogue retention straps. This allows the pilot chute to pull the drogue pack from the SRB, causing the drogue suspension lines to deploy from their stored position. At full extension of the twelve 105 ft suspension lines, the drogue deployment bag is stripped away from the canopy, and the 54 ft diameter conical ribbon drogue parachute inflates to its initial reefed condition. The drogue disreefs twice after specified time delays (using redundant 7 and 12-second reefing <b>line</b> <b>cutters),</b> and it reorients/stabilizes the SRB for main chute deployment. The drogue parachute has a design load of approximately 315000 lb and weighs approximately 1200 lb.|$|R
40|$|Easy to operate, speed <b>line</b> <b>cutter</b> {{has a high}} {{machining}} cost performance, so is {{very popular}} among the majority of users. The precision of guide rails, screws and nuts used {{in most of the}} machines is not high, and the machine control cannot compensate for the screw pitch error, clearance during the transmission and machining error due to electrode wear. Furthermore, control signal may also be lost in control process. The development of speed <b>line</b> <b>cutter</b> focuses on the quality and machining stability of CNC speed <b>line</b> <b>cutter.</b> This article makes an analysis about the impact of machine’s inherent characteristics on machining workpiece surface, and concludes that analysis shall be made on the irregular fringe, therefore to heighten the machining precision...|$|E
5000|$|As {{part of the}} [...] "Legacy Fleet", Tampa {{recently}} {{underwent a}} nine-month Mission Effectiveness Project (MEP) at the United States Coast Guard Yard. MEP is designed to extend Tampas operational life until the deployment of a new <b>line</b> of <b>cutters</b> from the Coast Guards Deepwater Program. With current and future updates of Deepwater electronics systems, a unique computer system and a modern array of weapons, Tampa is dramatically different from the half-century old vessels it replaced.|$|R
50|$|After the drogue chute has {{stabilized}} the SRB in a tail-first attitude, the frustum {{is separated}} from the forward skirt by a pyrotechnic charge triggered by the low-altitude baroswitch at a nominal altitude of 5500 ft about 243 seconds after SRB separation. The frustum is then {{pulled away from the}} SRB by the drogue chute. The main chute suspension lines are pulled out from deployment bags that remain in the frustum. At full extension of the lines, which are 203 ft long, the three main chutes are pulled from their deployment bags and inflate to their first reefed condition. The frustum and drogue parachute continue on a separate trajectory to splashdown. After specified time delays (using redundant 10 and 17-second reefing <b>line</b> <b>cutters),</b> the main chute reefing lines are cut and the chutes inflate to their second reefed and full open configurations. The main chute cluster decelerates the SRB to terminal conditions. Each of the 136 ft diameter, 20-degree conical ribbon parachutes have a design load of approximately 195000 lb and each weighs approximately 2180 lb. These parachutes are the largest that have ever been used — both in deployed size and load weight. The RSRM nozzle extension is severed by a pyrotechnic charge about 20 seconds after frustum separation.|$|R
5|$|Other {{branches}} of the ANNIKA business include a clothing <b>line</b> with <b>Cutter</b> & Buck, a limited label wine produced in partnership with Wente Vineyards, and a signature fragrance developed by SA Fragrances. Sörenstam also hosted the Ginn Tribute Hosted by Annika, an event on the LPGA Tour in 2007 and 2008, and the Scandinavian TPC hosted by Annika on the Ladies European Tour during its last four years from 2005 through 2008. She won the latter tournament in 2005 and 2006. Both tournaments had their last event in 2008.|$|R
50|$|The {{race was}} held on August 22, 1851, with a 10:00 AM start for a line of seven schooners and another <b>line</b> of eight <b>cutters.</b> America had a slow start due to a fouled anchor and was well behind when she finally got under way. Within half an hour however, she was in 5th place and gaining.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{alternative}} algorithms for generating pencil passes. [...] The method most commonly {{published in the}} academic literature involves creating tool surface offsets of the model surfaces and intersecting them to find the common <b>line</b> where the <b>cutter</b> would be in contact with two surfaces at once. An example of this implementation uses the ZMap method described by Park, et al.|$|R
2500|$|A {{variation}} on the horizontal stack offense is called a feature, German, or isolation (or “iso” for short). In this offensive strategy three of the <b>cutters</b> <b>line</b> up deeper than usual (this can vary from 5 yards farther downfield to at the endzone) while the remaining <b>cutter</b> <b>lines</b> up closer to the handlers. This closest cutter {{is known as the}} [...] "feature," [...] or [...] "German." [...] The idea behind this strategy is that it opens up space for the feature to cut, {{and at the same time}} it allows handlers to focus all of their attention on only one cutter. This maximizes the ability for give-and-go strategies between the feature and the handlers. It is also an excellent strategy if one cutter is superior to other cutters, or if he is guarded by someone slower than him. While the main focus is on the handlers and the feature, the remaining three cutters can be used if the feature cannot get open, if there is an open deep look, or for a continuation throw from the feature itself. Typically, however, these three remaining cutters do all they can to get out of the feature's way.|$|R

25|$|With {{large-scale}} projects like quilts, {{it is often}} advantageous to have a rotary cutter and mat. A rotary cutter is a cutting tool with a round blade, {{making it easy to}} cut a smooth, continuous <b>line.</b> Rotary <b>cutters</b> come with different sized blades: a larger blade is useful for large projects with straight lines, while a smaller blade is helpful for small areas or curved lines. A rotary mat protects tables and surfaces from the blade, while also protecting the cutting edge from damage. A quilting ruler can also be used, to help ensure that all pieces are cut to consistent sizes. Quilting rulers are made of clear plastic and have marked grid-lines {{across the surface of the}} ruler. This type of ruler makes it possible to cut a piece of fabric in the correct width or length without having to use a measuring tape and fabric chalk. Measurements have to include a seam allowance.|$|R

5000|$|The {{line was}} {{to connect with}} the Ararat - Avoca - Maryborough line with a {{junction}} installed at Ben Nevis and there was debate amongst the members of the Committee as to the exact location of the station at Navarre. At this early stage they could already see the possibility of it being extended to the north to Marnoo and St Arnaud.The line ran through lightly undulating, partly wooded countryside for some 22 miles (36 km). Gold had been found in the region during the 1850s and many of those pioneers who had arrived there at that time remained to establish their own farms and businesses. Planning for the line began some years before its actual construction and changes in its routing were to be inevitable. Originally the line was expected to service the expanding agricultural needs of the region, carrying livestock, wheat and chaff. Although the railway also operated a passenger service, one of the biggest users of the <b>line</b> were timber <b>cutters</b> and for a while six mills operated in the area supplying firewood to connecting stations including Ararat, Ballarat and further to the south-east the capital city of Victoria, Melbourne ...|$|R
50|$|In World War II the Accentor-class {{minesweeper}} {{was used}} to find five different types of mines. First is naval mines. This type of mine was covered in pressure sensors called detonating horns that detonated when a ship's pressure wave hits it. Second is the army mine. Army mines were remotely detonated by troops on land. The next is the antenna mine that has a copper wire to detect the magnetic field of a passing ship. Then there was leon mine which has a battery-powered motor that moves it up and down. It will detonate when it hits a ship. Lastly there are sonic mines that are detonated by the noise made by the engines of a passing ship. To sweep for these mines, the Accentor-class minesweepers used a complicated system that consisted of about 150 feet of wire line, a depressor, a cutter, an otter, and a float. The float sits {{on the surface of}} the water and is used to pull the end of the wire line out to the side of the ship to increase the area that the mine sweeper could sweep and not just have the system drag behind the ship. It uses a fixed rudder to set the angle that the float is from the ship, and since the float is on the end of the line this is also the angle that the line is from the ship. The float is connected to the otter by the line. The otter is like a metal kite that sweeps thirty feet under water. Next on the <b>line</b> is the <b>cutter</b> which cuts the cable that connects the mine to the mine anchor. Next is the depressor. The depressor {{was used to}} pull the line down to thirty feet underwater so that the mines would get caught on the line and the forward motion of the ship would drag the mine to the cutter. This was attached to the minesweeper by a pulley and winch system that allowed the ship to control the distance that the otter was from the ship. One of the problems with the Accentor-class minesweeper is that its small size made it difficult to get across oceans unless the weather was good. The minesweeper could get across an ocean, but it had to be scheduled around bad weather. The Accentor-class minesweepers were primarily meant to be used to locate mines that were in Allied water. This mines could include mines placed by Allied military for protecting harbors. Mines were placed so that the enemy was denied access to Allied coastal waters and harbors. This is called defensive mining. Offensive mining is used to close the coast of an enemy and the enemy’s harbors to their ships.|$|R
40|$|Mira Sanders lignes de temps A {{proposal}} by Eva González-Sancho March 21 to May 23, 2015 Opening reception: Friday, March 20, 2015, 6 to 8 pm Mira Sanders’ work {{deals with the}} positioning of ‘something’ in a concrete space – the placement of an object, a person, or a situation, crystallised in a single space, a terrain {{that acts as a}} support for intervention and for measuring and marking out. Lines and boundaries, cartographies and perspective drawings, overlap to describe itineraries, routes, transitory spaces, architectural blueprints or site plans, in which words delimit and redefine places, trajectories and ways forward. The artist shows physical places but the ultimate purpose is to sketch, to suggest a temporary relocation, as scraps of narrative, spread across various time-frames, or as small fictions described in minute detail. The methodology of a text. For her exhibition at the Lullin + Ferrari Gallery, Mira Sanders shows a series of works related to this special interest in lines – time lines – the fleeting landscapes that configure a journey (from the artist’s conception of the private). Sanders uses drawing, collage, video, the word, in a kind of segmentation of excursions whose point of departure is often the artist’s own studio (Scale 1 : 2500 Studio # 1; Scale 1 : 2500 Studio # 2 – two zenithal photographs taken in 2009, of a work surface scarred with a tracery left by the action of a <b>cutter).</b> <b>Lines</b> act as a kind of folding and unfolding of time, a simultaneity, for example in the plans that form part of Dans une profondeur atmosphérique du temps (2015) [In an atmospheric depth of time] or some of the collages in the series Traceur de lignes (2013) [Line tracer]. The first superimposes the different moments of a trajectory in a single space: the paper on which these are ‘aligned’. The second focuses on an action radiating from the centre which seems to disperse into the gallery space; a series of time lines, vanishing lines, invisible lines that pinpoint a series of displacements; but that also deconstruct them in some way. This refers to the Swiss architect Bernard Tschumi (cited in another of Sanders’ works here exhibited) and to the relations that Tschumi describes in his theories of spaces and the events that happen in them through processes of destructuring and superimposition. At the same time, the relationship to architecture and to urban planning in Mira Sanders’ work often explores ways of approaching the idea of ‘public’, by signifying an itinerary in space, or ways of thinking of space and its limits through an itinerary configured as segments of time. Words and various frontiers: Mira Sanders questions borders, the edges of physical space and the intimacy of journeying, of fitting into and fitting in with places, not the practice of public space so much as the practice of the commonplace. “They put borders whenever they want” is one of the somewhat quirky phrases that subtitle images in the video Silent Letters (2009), a series of letters to an unknown recipient in which language lends meaning to images stolen from public space whereby Sanders again questions the unfolding of a journey in time.
