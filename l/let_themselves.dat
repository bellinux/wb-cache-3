5|$|Shamanism was the {{dominant}} {{religion of the}} Jurchen people of northeast Asia and of their descendants, the Manchu people. As early as the Jin dynasty (1111–1234), the Jurchens conducted shamanic ceremonies at shrines called tangse. There were two kinds of shamans: those who entered in a trance and <b>let</b> <b>themselves</b> be possessed by the spirits, and those who conducted regular sacrifices to heaven, to a clan's ancestors, or to the clan's protective spirits.|$|E
5|$|According to Rose, {{the police}} <b>let</b> <b>themselves</b> {{into the house}} using Floyd's keys, without {{knocking}} or announcing themselves, while Cynthia and her family were watching television. The family said that an officer pushed Cynthia, causing her to fall. The officer denied this; the police said {{she had not been}} pushed but had simply collapsed. When it became clear she had stopped breathing, the same officer tried to revive her using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, to no avail. The pathologist testified at the inquest that the fall may have been a precipitating factor; the jury returned a verdict of accidental death, following the coroner's direction that such a verdict would mean Cynthia had been pushed, but perhaps accidentally.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{inconsistencies}} {{was whether}} the McCanns had entered the apartment by the front or back door when checking on the children. According to the Polícia Judiciária case file, Gerry stated during his first interview, on 4 May 2007, that the couple had entered 5A through the locked front door for his 21:05 and her 22:00 checks, and in a second interview, on 10 May, that he had entered through the unlocked patio doors at the back. (The patio doors could be unlocked only from inside, so the parents had left them unlocked to <b>let</b> <b>themselves</b> in.) There was also an inconsistency about whether the front door had been locked. Gerry told the Sunday Times in December 2007 that they had used the front door earlier in the week, but it was next to the children's bedroom, so they had started using the patio doors instead.|$|E

5|$|At 20:30 {{the parents}} left 5A to dine {{with their friends}} in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas {{restaurant}}, located {{on the other side}} of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could <b>let</b> <b>themselves</b> in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.|$|E
5|$|After having scouted the Russian fortifications at Grodno, Charles {{realized}} {{a frontal}} assault would be impossible. At the same time, the Russians would not <b>let</b> <b>themselves</b> be provoked {{out into the}} field. Charles instead decided to try and starve them out by crossing the Neman river in January 15, encircling the city from the east, forcing 15,000 Russian cavalry to withdraw. In doing this he blocked the Russian communication lines, and also cut off their resources and supplies. Smaller Swedish parties were sent towards Vilnius {{in order to prevent}} General Christian Felix Bauer from supplying the trapped Russians. One of these, commanded by Jan Kazimierz Sapieha and Józef Potocki managed to beat 3,000 Russians at the Battle of Olita on February 9. Meanwhile, on February 7 Schulenburg had received word of Charles' crossing of the Vistula, and begun his march with the Saxon army in order to beat Rehnskiöld's smaller force near Poznań. Rehnskiöld, however, did not wait to be defeated and instead strove to engage Schulenburg before the arrival of Augustus 8,000 men. By using a daring feint Rehnskiöld managed to lure Schulenburg into a more disadvantageous position near Wschowa (Fraustadt), where the two armies clashed on February 13. Here, the Swedish general won a decisive victory killing or capturing up to 75% of Schulenburg's force. Crippled by this setback, the main Saxon army {{had no choice but to}} retreat. The whole allied plan collapsed, as the opportunity for the allies to destroy Charles' army in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth with a sweeping movement from behind, vanished.|$|E
5|$|In late 1940, an {{engineer}} had created some military inventions which Gjems-Onstad's group {{wanted to bring}} to the Allied forces. It was decided that one of them was to travel to the UK, while Gjems-Onstad was to travel to Stockholm. Gjems-Onstad was joined by three others, and they decided to <b>let</b> <b>themselves</b> be arrested in Östmark in Sweden. They were transported to Stockholm, but the Norwegian legation was not interested in the inventions. Gjems-Onstad was later tipped to contact the British military attaché. He got in contact with Major Malcolm Munthe, who in turn was interested in the inventions. Gjems-Onstad was arrested by Swedish police in Stockholm on 25 March 1941, as parts of Munthe's organisation had been exposed. Gjems-Onstad was imprisoned at the Stockholm police station for 13 days, and then for 59 days in the Stockholm Remand Prison. On 23 May 1941 the government decided that he was to be expelled and banned from entering Sweden (the ban was repealed after the war). He was originally scheduled to be deported to Canada via Moscow and China, but the plans were halted due to the German invasion of the Soviet Union. He was instead sent to the Norwegian refugee camp in Öreryd. He was ordered by the British to escape from Öreryd in October 1941 and travel to Norway. He was captured by the Swedish Home Guard close to the Norwegian border, but was sent by plane to the UK by Swedish authorities in December.|$|E

25|$|Jumping spiders are {{generally}} diurnal, active hunters. Their well-developed internal hydraulic system extends their limbs by altering {{the pressure of}} body fluid (hemolymph) within them. This enables the spiders to jump without having large muscular legs like a grasshopper. Most jumping spiders can jump several times the length of their bodies. When a jumping spider is moving from place to place, and especially just before it jumps, it tethers a filament of silk (or 'dragline') to whatever it is standing on to protect itself if the jump should fail. Should it fall, for example if the prey shakes it off, it climbs back up the silk tether. Some species, such as Portia, will actually <b>let</b> <b>themselves</b> down to attack prey such as a web spider apparently secure {{in the middle of}} its web. Like many other spiders that leave practically continuous silk trails, jumping spiders impregnate the silk line with pheromones that play a role in social and reproductive communication, and possibly in navigation.|$|E

500|$|Kellner's diary {{takes to}} task {{not only the}} German people who elected Hitler, but the {{citizens}} and leaders of other nations who remained indifferent to evidence that dictators in Germany, Italy and Japan were plotting to take possession of the entire world. In a number of entries, Kellner accused politicians in the democracies of failing to stand up against the dictators. He {{pointed out that the}} world’s intelligentsia, university professors and professionals in medicine and law, were willing to accept the National Socialist propaganda. “The whole world <b>let</b> <b>themselves</b> be fooled by this man,” he wrote on May 3, 1942." ...|$|E

5000|$|Assimilation or anglicization, a clear path {{laid out}} since the Union of 1840, is {{proposed}} to French Canadians {{on a regular}} basis writes Chaput. The logic of assimilation is implacable, and those who advocate it among French Canadians share with the indépendantistes having had enough of being [...] "second-class citizens" [...] and being [...] "used as innocent victims in the entertainment of an illusion, that of a bilingual Canada". The assimilationists want French Canadians {{to put an end to}} their [...] "diminished national life" [...] by <b>letting</b> <b>themselves</b> be won by the appeal of an all-English life, by <b>letting</b> <b>themselves</b> be vanquished by the arms used in the assimilation of peoples: [...] "interests, thought currents, trends, psychological climates". On their side, the militants of independence claim to wish to end the diminished national life of French Canadians, the bilingualism forced upon them by their dependence on English, not by becoming fully English, but by becoming fully French.|$|R

After five years with these elements in mind, he had the idea of writing the novel during a difficult period in his life. He was experiencing an unpleasant breakup of his own which led him to ask, [...] "Why good people <b>let</b> <b>themselves</b> get treated so badly?" [...] The author tried {{to answer the question}} with the sentence [...] "we accept the love we think we deserve". This answer meant to be an advice to remark that one is in charge of one's life as he is referring to self love, encompassing one's life and hope for the future, and not just romantic love.|$|E
500|$|There {{were two}} kinds of Jurchen shamanistic rituals, {{corresponding}} to {{two kinds of}} shamans. The most common was [...] "domestic ritual": ritual-based sacrifices to Heaven and to the clan's ancestors conducted by hereditary shamans from that clan. [...] "Primitive ritual," [...] on the other hand, was performed by people who had undergone a [...] "shamanic illness," [...] which {{was seen as a}} sign that they had been chosen by the spirits. Entering into a trance, these [...] "transformational" [...] shamans <b>let</b> <b>themselves</b> be possessed by various animal spirits and sought the help of these spirits for purposes like healing or exorcism. These shamans set up an altar in their own houses and received a different kind of training from hereditary shamans.|$|E
500|$|The {{conflict}} blurred ethnic lines. Many Serbs who {{had lived}} in Vukovar for generations– known as the starosedioci or [...] "old settlers"– resisted the propaganda coming from Belgrade and Knin and continued to live peacefully with their Croatian neighbours. The došljaci, or [...] "newcomers", whose families had relocated from southern Serbia and Montenegro to replace the deported Germans after 1945, were the most responsive to nationalist appeals. The journalist Paolo Rumiz describes how they [...] "tried to win their coethnics over to the patriotic mobilization, and when they had no success with that, they killed them, plundered their property and goods, or drove them away. The old settlers would not <b>let</b> <b>themselves</b> be stirred up against other nationalities." [...] When Croats fled the fighting they often gave their house keys for safekeeping to their Serb neighbours, whom they trusted, rather than to the Croatian police. The political scientist Sabrina P. Ramet notes that a distinctive feature of the war in eastern Slavonia was [...] "the mobilization of those who were not integrated into the multi-cultural life of the cities against urban multi-culturalism." [...] Former Belgrade mayor Bogdan Bogdanović characterised the attack on Vukovar as an act of urbicide, a deliberate assault on urbanism.|$|E
