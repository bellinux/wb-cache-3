5|$|By the 1780s, {{the brewery}} {{probably}} had an annual output of around 1,500 barrels, {{similar to the}} rival breweries of Benjamin Wilson and Michael Bass. Throughout the eighteenth century, Worthington sales were mostly of porter, directed towards the Baltic market, which was transported via narrowboat through the River Trent to the Port of Hull. <b>Largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> this trade, {{by the time of}} Worthington's death in 1800, Worthington & Co. ranked among the largest of the provincial breweries.|$|E

5|$|In 1885 the Democrats redistricted the Indiana state legislature, which {{resulted}} in an increased Democratic majority in 1886, despite an overall Republican majority statewide. In 1887, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the Democratic gerrymandering of Indiana's legislative districts, Harrison was defeated in his bid for reelection. Following a deadlock in the state senate, the state legislature eventually chose Democrat David Turpie as Harrison's successor in the U.S. Senate. Harrison returned to Indianapolis and resumed his law practice, but stayed active in state and national politics.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} {{days of the}} trial, Quisling's health suffered, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the number of medical tests {{to which he was}} subjected, and his defence faltered. The prosecution's {{powerful}} final speech placed responsibility for the Final Solution being carried out in Norway at the feet of Quisling, using the testimony of German officials. The prosecutor Annæus Schjødt called for the death penalty, using laws introduced by the government-in-exile in October 1941 and January 1942.|$|E

Forty-eight US states allowed religious exemptions for compulsory vaccination as of June 2015. In Australia the church was the only group with a religious exemption for vaccination as of April 2015; the government said that it planned to remove it.|$|E
30|$|The {{evidence}} {{from a wide}} range of evaluations suggests that services of this nature are typically effective at helping individuals to obtain employment more rapidly, and, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result,</b> can raise earnings at least in the short-run (LaLonde [1995]; O’Leary [2004]). Positive impacts have been found for most types of these services, including employment services and job search assistance, and for most populations who use them, including those on UI as well as the economically disadvantaged including participants in welfare-to-work programs. Because such services are relatively inexpensive to provide on a per participant basis, they are usually found to be cost effective.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the war, the War Office {{controlled}} around 78,000 {{acres of}} Dartmoor (through ownership, lease, license or requisition). Of these, 49,000 were barred to the public on a permanent basis. In July 1947, the report of the Hobhouse Committee on National Parks emphasized the special significance of Dartmoor and <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> by 1948 the military's land holdings were reduced to 37,400 acres, of which permanent closure affected 9,000 acres, 20,850 acres were closed during training exercises and 7,550 acres were accessible at all times. In 1951, Dartmoor National Park came into existence.|$|R

5|$|During the Six-Day War in June 1967, Deir al-Balah's mayor Sulaiman al-Azayiza briefly led local {{resistance}} against the incoming Israeli Army until formally surrendering the city shortly thereafter. The Israeli authorities {{took control of}} the springs, an important irrigation source. This move combined with increasing competition from Israeli citrus farmers, damaged the local citrus industry. In 1982 the mayor was dismissed and the municipal council of Deir al-Balah was disbanded and replaced by an Israeli military-appointed administration. During the course of the Israeli occupation, Deir al-Balah's urban areas extended into lands designated for agriculture, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> building restrictions which hindered organized expansion.|$|E
5|$|Howard Staunton (1810– 22 June 1874) was an English chess master who is {{generally}} regarded as having been the world's strongest player from 1843 to 1851, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> his 1843 victory over Saint-Amant. He promoted a chess set of clearly distinguishable pieces of standardised shape—the Staunton pattern promulgated by Nathaniel Cook—that is still the style required for competitions. He was the principal organiser of the first international chess tournament in 1851, which made England the world's leading chess centre and caused Adolf Anderssen to be recognised as the world's strongest player.|$|E
5|$|More goods became {{available}} in St. Louis during the economic recovery, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the new steamboat power. Wholesalers, new banks, and other retail stores opened {{starting in the}} late 1820s and early 1830s. The fur trade continued as a major industry into the 1830s. In 1822, Jedediah Smith joined William H. Ashley's St. Louis fur trading company. Smith would later be known for his explorations of the West and for being the first American to travel overland to California. New fur trade companies such as the Rocky Mountain Fur Company pioneered trails west. Although beaver fur lost its popularity in the 1840s, St. Louis continued as a hub of buffalo hide and other furs.|$|E

The organization issued its experimental eastern Pacific outlook on May21, highlighting a 45 percent change of below-average activity, 45 percent chance of near-average activity, and only a 10 percent chance of above-average activity in the basin. A total of 13 to 15 named storms, 6 to 8 hurricanes, and 2 to 4 major hurricanes was forecast.|$|E

5|$|While some culinary {{practices}} and dishes have been imported from its British neighbors, uniquely Welsh cuisine grew principally from {{the lives of}} Welsh working people, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> their isolation from outside culinary influences {{and the need to}} produce food based on the limited ingredients they could produce or afford. Welsh Celts and their more recent Welsh descendants originally practiced transhumance, moving their cattle to higher elevations in the summer and back to their home base in the winter. Once they settled to homesteads, a family would have generally eaten meat from a pig primarily, keeping a cow for dairy products.|$|E

5|$|Edward was crowned at age {{fourteen}} {{after his}} father was deposed by his mother, Isabella of France, and her lover Roger Mortimer. At age seventeen he led a successful coup against Mortimer, the de facto ruler of the country, and began his personal reign. After a successful campaign in Scotland he declared himself rightful heir to the French throne in 1337 but his claim was denied. This started {{what became known as}} the Hundred Years' War. Following some initial setbacks the war went exceptionally well for England; victories at Crécy and Poitiers led to the highly favourable Treaty of Brétigny. Edward's later years were marked by international failure and domestic strife, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> his inactivity and poor health.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of this period, through a process of conquest, {{consolidation}} and treaty, the boundaries of Scotland were gradually extended from a small area under direct control of the kings of Alba in the east, to almost its modern borders. For most of the Medieval era the monarchy and court was itinerant, with Scone and Dunfermline acting as important centres and later Roxburgh, Stirling and Perth, before Edinburgh emerged as the political capital in the fourteenth century. <b>Largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> Viking raids from about 800, Iona declined as a religious centre. Despite royal attempts to establish a new religious centre at Dunkeld, it was St. Andrews on the east coast, close to the heartland of Pictish settlement, that emerged as the most important religious focus of the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} land surveyor, Boydell apprenticed {{himself to}} William Henry Toms, an artist he admired, and learned engraving. He {{established}} his own business in 1746 and published his first book of engravings around the same time. Boydell did not think much of his own artistic efforts and eventually started buying the works of others, becoming a print dealer {{as well as an}} artist. He became a successful importer of French prints during the 1750s but was frustrated by their refusal to trade prints in kind. To spark reciprocal trade, he commissioned William Wollett's spectacular engraving of Richard Wilson's The Destruction of the Children of Niobe, which revolutionised the print trade. Ten years later, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> Boydell's initiative, the trade imbalance had shifted, and he was named a fellow of the Royal Society for his efforts.|$|E

5|$|Howard Browne, who {{had been}} on a leave of absence from Ziff-Davis to write fiction, took over as editor and began by {{throwing}} away 300,000 words of inventory that Palmer had acquired before he left. Browne had ambitions of moving Amazing upmarket, and his argument was strengthened by Street & Smith, one of the longest established and most respected publishers, who shut down all of their pulp magazines in the summer of 1949. The pulps were dying, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the success of pocketbooks, and Street & Smith decided to concentrate on their slick magazines. Some pulps struggled on for a few more years, but Browne was able to persuade Ziff and Davis that the future was in the slicks, and they raised his fiction budget from one cent to a ceiling of five cents per word. Browne managed to get promises of new stories from many well-known authors, including Isaac Asimov and Theodore Sturgeon. He produced a dummy issue in April 1950, and planned to launch the new incarnation of Amazing in April 1951, the 25th anniversary of the first issue. However, the economic impact of the Korean War, which broke out in June 1950, led to budget cuts. The plans were cancelled, and Ziff-Davis never revived the idea.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{delivery}} of postgraduate education is {{in a significant}} state of change. A major participant, the MBA degree, is subject to new technological delivery options, competition, changing and increased demand, and pressure for a better product delivered in a shorter period of time. Many strategies are being developed to respond to these pressures. This paper outlines key elements of the environment, strategies in its delivery, and concludes {{with a discussion of}} a particular strategy: virtual seminars. This strategy follows a rather classic re-engineering framework of the program itself, and focuses both on modularity of the educational offering to fit several different purposes and instructional design features needed to optimize learning for different educational purposes.

Universities are subscribing to the notion of executive education, lifelong learning, and program profitability, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> o...|$|R
5000|$|Schwartz' public {{career in}} {{politics}} stopped {{for many years}} after graduate school. In 2008, however, he {{became involved in the}} Presidential race supporting the Republican ticket of John McCain and Sarah Palin. He founded and chaired a grassroots organization called Music Row 4 McCain that generated networking and media attention for McCain/Palin. <b>Largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result,</b> he was one of 100 Americans to be named to the Platform Committee to the 2008 Republican National Convention in Minneapolis. As a freshman on the Platform Committee, Schwartz added [...] "home schooling" [...] <b>as</b> <b>a</b> legitimate alternative to public school education to the Platform. He also drafted language that was approved on a voice vote of the full Committee emphasizing the importance of prevention and early detection in health policy. Schwartz was also elected and served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Delegate-at-Large from Tennessee to the 2008 Convention. After the loss of the McCain/Palin ticket, Schwartz returned to local grassroots activities. He was elected one of three Regional Directors of the Davidson County Republican Party. [...] He also served as Membership Chair for the group and, in that role, worked to bring trainers from Leadership Institute, the Arlington-based conservative think tank where he had previously studied, to two training workshops in Nashville. Schwartz began investigating a run against long-time incumbent Democrat Jim Cooper in Tennessee's Fifth Congressional District in 2009. Cooper, the wealthy son of a former Tennessee Governor, announced his intention to run for re-election to a ninth term in Congress. Schwartz entered a crowded Republican field and focused his campaign on healthcare reform and legislative reforms in Congress. He lost his bid in the August primary finishing a distant fifth place. In 2012, he served as Executive Director of Newt Gingrich's statewide volunteer effort. <b>Largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result,</b> he was <b>a</b> Delegate to the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa garnering more votes in Tennessee's Fifth Congressional District than Gingrich or eventual party nominee Mitt Romney.|$|R
5000|$|Despite his {{reputation}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> master promoter, Finley had less success marketing his team.
