5000|$|The {{quality of}} a beam is {{important}} for many applications. In fiber-optic communications beams with an M2 close to 1 are required for coupling to single-mode optical fiber. <b>Laser</b> <b>machining</b> and laser welding shops care {{a lot about the}} M2 parameter of their lasers because the beams will focus to an area that is M2 times larger than that of a Gaussian beam with the same wavelength; in other words, the fluence scales as 1/M2.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{application of}} laser ablation {{is to remove}} material from a solid surface in a controlled fashion. <b>Laser</b> <b>machining</b> and particularly laser drilling are examples; pulsed lasers can drill extremely small, deep holes through very hard materials. Very short laser pulses remove material so quickly that the surrounding material absorbs very little heat, so laser drilling can be done on delicate or heat-sensitive materials, including tooth enamel (laser dentistry).Several workers have employed laser ablation and gas condensation to produce nano particles of metal, metal oxides and metal carbides.|$|E

50|$|The OB mode is {{observed}} when a material {{is subjected to}} powerful laser pulses. It manifests a power threshold {{in the range of}} MW for the majority of dielectric materials, which depends on the duration and on the wavelength of the laser pulse. Optical breakdown is related to the dielectric breakdown phenomenon which was studied and modeled successfully {{towards the end of the}} 1950s. One describes the effect as a strong local ionization of the medium, where the plasma reaches densities beyond the critical value (between 1020 and 1022 electrons/cm³). Once the plasma critical density is achieved, energy is very efficiently absorbed from the light pulse, and the local plasma temperature increases dramatically. An explosive Coulombian expansion follows, and forms a very powerful and damaging shockwave through the material that develops on ns timescale. In liquids one talks about cavitation bubbles. If the rate of plasma formation is relatively slow, in the nanosecond time regime (for nanosecond excitation laser pulses), energy is transferred from the plasma to the lattice, and thermal damages can occur. In the femtosecond time regime (for femtosecond excitation laser pulses) the plasma expansion happens on a timescale smaller than the rate of energy transfer to the lattice, and thermal damages are reduced or eliminated. This is the basis of cold <b>laser</b> <b>machining</b> using high-power sub-ps laser sources.|$|E
