40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{investigated}} {{the capacity of the}} E 20 rat fetus to adaptively alter patterns of interlimb coordination in a prenatal model of motor learning. Fetal limb movement was manipulated with an interlimb yoke, consisting of a fine thread attached at the ankles, which created a physical linkage between two <b>limbs.</b> <b>Exposure</b> to the yoke resulted in a gradual increase in conjugate movements of the yoked limbs during a 30 -min training period, which persisted after removal of the yoke. Training effects were evident when the yoke was applied to two hindlimbs, two forelimbs, or a homolateral forelimb–hindlimb pair. A savings in the rate of acquisition also was observed when fetuses experienced yoke training in a second session. These data argue that the rat fetus can respond to kinesthetic feedback resulting from variation in motor performance, which suggests that experience contributes to the development of coordinated motor behavior before birth...|$|R

40|$|This review {{focuses on}} teratogens that cause limb malformations and the {{underlying}} mechanisms they deregulate to cause this. Normal limb development starts with proliferation of the intermediate mesoderm at sites along the body’s antero-posterior axis designated to form limbs.

The sural fasciomusculocutaneous flap is a safe alternative to other pedicled and free flaps.

50|$|In {{cold weather}} the {{blood flow to}} the limbs of birds and mammals is reduced on {{exposure}} to cold environmental conditions, and returned to the trunk via the deep veins which lie alongside the arteries (forming venae comitantes). This acts as a counter-current exchange system which short-circuits the warmth from the arterial blood directly into the venous blood returning into the trunk, causing minimal heat loss from the extremities in cold weather. The subcutaneous limb veins are tightly constricted, thereby reducing heat loss via this route, and forcing the blood returning from the extremities into the counter-current blood flow systems in the centers of the limbs. Birds and mammals that regularly immerse their limbs in cold or icy water have particularly well developed counter-current blood flow systems to their <b>limbs,</b> allowing prolonged <b>exposure</b> of the extremities to the cold without significant loss of body heat, even when the limbs are as thin as the lower legs, or tarsi, of a bird, for instance.|$|R

Severe mutilating injuries of the upper limb in children represent a great challenge to reconstructive surgeons especially when important structures become exposed. Materials & Methods: we utilized LDM as an island flap to cover extensive soft tissue defects in the upper limb of pediatric patients. This work included 17 children (13 males and 4 females). All of them had extensive soft tissue loss of the upper <b>limb</b> with <b>exposure</b> of important structures. The cause of injury was road traffic accident in all patients. We analyzed the operative time, need for multi-stage surgery and the recorded complications. Finally, we recorded the ultimate functional and aesthetic outcome after a period of two years of follow up. Results: From the harvested seventeen flaps, none of them was lost. Split thickness skin graft was done one week after flap harvesting and insetting to cover the muscle flap. There were four cases with partial loss of the skin graft secondary to infection. Those four cases needed re-grafting after eradication of infection that needed almost two weeks of local wound care and dressing. Re-grafting was successful in the four cases. Conclusion: For complex upper extremity wounds in the pediatric age group, we advice aggressive debridement and early reconstruction with LDM pedicle flap with a split-thickness skin graft cover over it. The technique is reliable, with minimal donor site morbidity and very accepted functional and cosmetic outcome. Index Word: Latissimus dorsi muscle flap, complex trauma, pediatric age group...|$|R
40|$|Hypertension is a {{major risk}} factor for heart disease and stroke. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and {{international}} hypertension guidelines recommend measuring blood pressure (BP) in both arms during initial assessment of high blood pressure. This is not routinely done, and impracticality of the methods may be a reason for this. An inter-arm difference in blood pressure (lAD) is common and is important because: i. If undetected an inappropriately low BP is recorded with consequent underdiagnosis andlor under-treatment of hypertension. ii. lAD is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. iii. Detecting lAD could identify people with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). It is assumed that an lAD is caused by <b>localised</b> upper <b>limb</b> PAD, but no direct evidence exists to support this; existing data is derived from selected groups with established vascular disease. Therefore this thesis by submission of papers aims to I. examine the strength of current evidence for an association of lAD with PAD and cardiovascular disease ii. explore the cross sectional and prospective associations of an lAD with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in community cohorts representative of primary care populations, and iii. examine the utility of a single sequential pair of BP readings in predicting {{the presence or absence}} of a significant lAD measured by reference standard techniques. My systematic review findings showed that a systolic lAD ≥ 15 mmHg was associated with PAD, pre-existing cerebrovascular disease and increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. These associations are confirmed in subsequent analyses of new cohorts representative of primary care populations with hypertension, diabetes, and in a large community cohort free of clinically evident vascular disease. Cross sectional associations with markers of vascular stiffness are examined and the aetiology of an lAD is explored. A single pair of measurements is shown to reliably exclude the presence of an lAD confirmed by the reference standard technique, suggesting that a pragmatic measurement technique could initially be employed in primary care. The implications of these findings are discussed and future areas of research identified. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

IPS, including identification of anatomical landmarks, incisions, underlying structures, and time to completion of each procedure was compared before and after training using repeated measurement models. Setting Audio-video instrumented cadaver laboratory at University of Maryland School of Medicine. Participants A total of 41 second to sixth year surgical residents from surgical programs throughout Mid-Atlantic States who had not previously taken the ASSET course were enrolled, 40 completed the pre- and post-ASSET performance evaluations. Results After ASSET training, all components of IPS increased and time shortened {{for each of the}} 3 artery exposures. Procedure steps performed correctly increased 57 %, anatomical knowledge increased 43 % and skin incision to passage of a vessel loop twice around the correct vessel decreased by a mean of 2. 5 minutes.

The condition of the wound locally and the patient in general does not always allow immediate and adequate coverage of the structures exposed by the trauma. Therefore, new therapeutic solutions are needed. A reduction {{in the time that}} bones and tendons are exposed is essential to achieve complete healing of bone fractures, with reduced risks of infection and less disabling outcomes. The effectiveness of vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy in supporting wound healing and of cryopreserved homologous de-epidermalised dermis (DED) in providing an effective template for re-epithelialisation has been previously reported. We carried out a study {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the synergistic and combined use of the two methodologies. Eighteen patients with traumatic loss of tissue in the lower <b>limbs,</b> involving <b>exposure</b> of bone and tendon structures, were enrolled in the study. All participants had local, general contraindications to first-instance reconstructions, or both. All patients received a combination of VAC therapy and DED implants. Granulation tissue was obtained in all wounds, with complete coverage of exposed structures. No infections were detected in the cohort, and all patients were prepared for further necessary reconstructive treatments. In our experience, the combination of VAC therapy and DED could, in selected cases, constitute an effective treatment for complex lower limb traumatic injuries with bone and tendon exposure...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Fossilised {{footprints}} {{have been}} discovered {{all over the world}} and can provide information regarding the foot size and subsequent body size estimates of the track makers or an insight into the kinematics of the foot/lower <b>limb.</b> After <b>exposure,</b> these fossils rapidly erode. It is predicted that footprint morphology is compromised after creation, prior to fossilisation and that erosion after exposure will affect the morphology of a footprint after exposure. To date, no studies have assessed if degradation prior to fossilisation and/or after fossilisation, and subsequent exposure, affects the morphology of the print, thereby affecting any measurements taken. This study aims to quantify these pre- and post-erosional processes. Materials and methods: A set of experimentally generated footprints were created to test the effects of degradation of footprint morphology prior to fossilisation. In addition, Holocene footprints were recorded at Formby Point, Sefton, UK. In just over a week tidal action had completely eroded the Holocene beds. Photogrammetry was applied to the experimental human footprints and a selection of Holocene human and animal footprints. Three-dimensional Geometric Morphometric methods were utilised to estimate differences in shape and size. Results: Results from the experimental footprints indicate that weather action affects the size and shape of a footprint prior to fossilisation. When the weather was dry, footprint shape and size showed little difference for two weeks, but rainfall caused significant changes. The Holocene footprints show that after fossilisation and exposure to coastal erosion, footprint rigidity is highly compromised. The human footprint borders progressively recede, increasing length and width each day. Footprint depth, often used to inform upon speed and kinematics, varied considerably in one week. Some regions becoming shallower, others increasing in depth. Similar results were found for the animal footprints, but with less significant changes in shape and size determined. Conclusion: Observed significant differences in measurements result in problems for predicting stature, mass, sex, and kinematic analyses. This warrants caution when making interpretations from fossilised footprints. Rapid recording of fossilised prints from first exposure and assessing pre-fossilisation processed are necessities when recording footprint surfaces...|$|R
40|$|HIV-associated {{lipodystrophy}} (HIVLD) {{syndrome is}} a condition comprising abnormalities in distribution of body fat and metabolism of lipids and glucose that arises in HIV-infected patients on long-term antiretroviral therapy. This thesis describes clinical research into aspects of the natural history and treatment of HIVLD, as well as molecular research into its pathogenesis centred on subcutaneous adipose tissue. Results demonstrate HIVLD to be a treatment-induced syndrome characterised by initial gains in body fat followed by selective, progressive loss of <b>limb</b> fat. <b>Exposure</b> to thymidineanalogue nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (tNRTI) induces lipoatrophy through mitochondrial dysfunction of which inhibition of mitochondrial RNA expression, rather than mitochondrial DNA depletion, is an early feature. Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with decreases in expression of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma (PPAR&# 947;), an adipocyte transcription factor, which helps explain how tNRTI exposure leads {{to the loss of}} adipocyte function. Once established, lipoatrophy is characterised by mitochondrial DNA depletion, although this depletion occurs throughout the mitochondrial genome, suggesting an underlying cause other than inhibition of DNA polymerase gamma. HIVLD is a difficult syndrome to treat. Lipoatrophy is resistant to treatment with rosiglitazone, an agonist of PPAR&# 947;, which is ineffective in the setting of ongoing tNRTI therapy and mitochondrial dysfunction. Dyslipidaemia is also difficult to treat as use of pravastatin in the setting of ongoing exposure to protease inhibitors results in only modest declines in fasting cholesterol concentrations. Gains in central fat, such as that seen in patients with buffalo hump, are associated with insulin resistance and diabetes, but only occur in a relatively small percentage of treated patients, suggesting a role for genetic factors in its development. Use of strategies such as avoidance of tNRTI in firstline ART, genetic screening to identify those at risk of toxicities and targeted selection of interventions in subgroups of affected patients, may help prevent this syndrome occurring and better treat those patients in which it has already occurred...|$|R

We sought additional evidence relevant to this hypothesis by performing direct measurements of the effective surface tension, a measure of relative tissue cohesivity, of 4 -day embryonic chicken wing and leg bud mesenchymal tissue, and adjacent flank mesoderm. As predicted, the two types of limb tissues were 1. 5 - to 2 -fold more cohesive than the flank tissue. These differences paralleled cell number and volume density differences: 4 -day limb buds had 2 - to 2. 5 -fold as many cells per unit area of tissue as surrounding flank, a difference also seen at 3  days, when <b>limb</b> budding begins. <b>Exposure</b> of flank tissue to exogenous FGF 8 for 24 h increased its cell number and raised its cohesivity to limb-like values. Four-day flank tissue exhibited a novel and unique active rebound response to compression, which was suppressed by the drug latrunculin and therefore dependent on an intact actin cytoskeleton. Correspondingly, flank at this stage expressed high levels of α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) mRNA and protein and a dense network of microfilaments. Treatment of flank with FGF 8 eliminated the rebound response. We term material properties of tissues, such as cohesivity and mechanical excitability, the “physical phenotype”, and propose that changes thereof are driving forces of morphogenesis. Our results indicate that two independent aspects of the physical phenotype of flank mesoderm can be converted to a limb-like state in response to treatment with FGF 8. The higher tissue cohesivity induced by this effect will cause the incipient limb bud to phase separate from the surrounding flank, while the active mechanical response of the flank could help ensure that the limb bud bulges out from, rather than becoming engulfed by, this less cohesive tissue...|$|R

Also, some patients report that pain can be exacerbated by loud noises and ambiguous visual stimuli, suggesting changes in multisensory integration. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate spatial localisation and multisensory integration in patients with CRPS. Methods Participants were 8 CRPS patients (3 upper limb, 5 lower limb) and 17 pain-free controls. In separate blocks participants performed a target pointing task under visual-only (V) guidance, proprioceptive/motor-only (P/M) guidance and combined visual and proprioceptive/motor (V-P/M) guidance. During each block participants rested their head in a chin rest and directed their gaze to a fixation cross on the surface of a table. Laser pointers were used to project brief (200 ms) targets 10 cm to the left or right of the fixation cross (10 / Side). In the V block the participants gave verbal directions to the experimenter as to where the target had appeared and the experimenter placed a mark at the location indicated. In the P/M blocks the participant’s vision of the table surface and hand was occluded immediately after the target disappeared and the participant touched the target’s location with their index finger. In the V-P/M blocks the participant touched the target’s location with full vision of the table surface and their hand. Participants completed each P/M and V-P/M block once with their left and once with their right hand. Pointing end-points were recorded by placing ink on the participant’s finger, which was transferred to the paper when they touched the page. The paper was refreshed after every trial. Results For each participant, estimates of variable error (VE: the sum of the variance of the points in x and y directions) were calculated separately for each condition (V, P/M, V-P/M). To evaluate localisation ability in CRPS, the VEs of individual patients were compared to bootstrapped (1000 samples) 95 % Confidence Intervals (CIs) around the controls’ means. One upper limb and one lower limb CRPS patient had VEs that were within the controls’ 95 % CI for all three conditions. The remaining six patients had VEs that exceeded the upper boundary of the 95 % CI for the controls’ means in at least one condition. Specifically, four had larger-than-normal VEs in the V condition, two had larger-than-normal VEs in the P/M condition, and five had larger-than-normal VEs in the V-P/M condition. This suggests that CRPS can be accompanied by deficits in localisation under both uni- and multi-modal guidance. Preliminary inspection of VE data when separated by Hand and Target Side suggests that more patients were impaired in P/M guidance for targets that appeared on the affected side compared to the unaffected side of space, regardless of which hand was used. Planned paired-samples t-tests with bootstrapping (1000 samples) showed that for control participants the VEs in the V-P/M condition were lower than in both the V condition (p=. 002) and the P/M condition (p=. 001). This is consistent with previous findings that uncertainty is reduced during multi-sensory compared to uni-sensory localisation. For the patients, VEs in the V-P/M condition were not significantly different to VEs in the V condition (p=. 11) nor the P/M condition (p=. 35). This is suggestive of a deficit in multisensory integration. Conclusions The results provide evidence for impaired spatial localisation in CRPS under conditions of visual-only, proprioceptive/motor-only, and combined visual and proprioceptive/motor guidance. Four of the five lower limb CRPS patients showed some form of localisation deficit, indicating that these changes are not limited to tasks involving the affected limb but generalise to broader spatial cognition. The results also provide preliminary evidence for deficits in multisensory integration in CRPS, although this conclusion should be treated with caution due to the small and heterogeneous sample...|$|R
40|$|A {{paucity of}} {{research}} exists to characterise and investigate lower-body musculoskeletal characteristics and morphological adaptations in elite Australian Footballers {{with the aim}} to improve screening, monitoring and load management practices. Given the high prevalence of lower-body skeletal injuries in Australian Football; {{and the ability to}} measure, modify and train muscle and bone strength and their derivatives; this project served to extend scientific understanding of musculoskeletal morphology and bone strength characteristics in elite level field-based team sport athletes through a series of research studies using Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (pQCT). In particular, studies one and two provided normative and comparative lower-body musculoskeletal profiles of elite Australian Footballers, stratified by training age (<b>exposure),</b> <b>limb</b> function (asymmetry) and injury incidence (stress fracture), while study three quantified the morphological changes and magnitude of adaptation and maladaptation experienced by Australian Footballers following an in-season and off-season annual phase. The general conclusion provided by the collective studies of this thesis promotes the importance of bone structure and geometry as potent contributors to skeletal robustness, and bone strength. Athletes with higher levels of training exposure and greater physical resilience exhibited higher tibial mass and cortical density with thicker cortical walls and larger muscle and bone cross-sectional areas. Asymmetrical adaptations from differential loading patterns between limbs through-out an in-season and off-season generate vastly different unilateral load tolerance capabilities when extrapolated overtime. The high-impact gravitational loads experienced by the support limb appear to optimise the development of robust skeletal properties specific to bone structure and geometry which may serve as a loading model to prophylactically enhance bilateral musculoskeletal strength and resilience. Study one provided a set of normative and comparative lower-body musculoskeletal values to describe and compare muscle and bone morphology between less experienced and more experienced athletes (training age); and differential loading patterns between the kicking and support limbs (limb function). Fifty-five athletes were stratified into less experienced (≤ 3 years; n = 27) and more experienced (3 ̆e 3 years; n = 28) groups in accordance with their training age. All athletes underwent whole-body DXA scans and lower-body pQCT tibial scans on the kicking and support limbs respectively. More experienced players exhibited greater tibial mass, trabecular vBMD, cortical vBMD and total vBMD (p 3 ̆c 0. 009; d ≥ 0. 79); greater cortical thickness and cortical area (p 3 ̆c 0. 001; d ≥ 0. 92), and larger stress-strain indices and absolute fracture loads (p ≤ 0. 018; d ≥ 0. 57) than less experienced players. More experienced players also exhibited greater muscle mass and muscle cross-sectional area (p ≤ 0. 016; d ≥ 0. 68). Differences were also observed between limbs, with greater material (tibial mass and cortical vBMD), structural (trabecular area, cortical area, total area, periosteal area and cortical thickness) and strength (stress-strain index and absolute fracture load) characteristics evident in the support leg comparative to the kicking leg of more experienced players (d ≥ 0. 20); with significantly higher asymmetries in tibial mass and cross-sectional area evident in more experienced players than less experienced players as a product of limb function over time. The findings of this study illustrate that training exposure and continued participation in Australian Football produced greater lower-body material, structural and strength adaptations; with chronic exposure to asymmetrical loading patterns developing differential morphological changes between the kicking and support Study two provided a retrospective and comparative set of lower-body musculoskeletal data to describe and compare muscle and bone morphology between injured and non-injured Australian Football athletes, in addition to injured and non-injured limbs within injured players, in order to identify musculoskeletal characteristics which may predispose athletes to stress fractures or highlight skeletal fragility. Fifty-five athletes were stratified into injured (n = 13) and non-injured (n = 42) groups. All athletes underwent whole-body DXA scans and lower-body pQCT tibial scans across both limbs. Injured players exhibited lower tibial mass (p ≤ 0. 019; d ≥ 0. 68), cortical vBMD (d ≥ 0. 38) and marrow vBMD (d ≥ 0. 21); smaller cortical area and periosteal area (p ≤ 0. 039; d ≥ 0. 63); smaller trabecular area, marrow area, total area, endocortical area and cortical thickness (d ≥ 0. 22); lower stress-strain indices, absolute fracture loads and relative fracture loads (support leg: p ≤ 0. 043; d ≥ 0. 70, kicking leg: d ≥ 0. 48) than non-injured players. Injured players also exhibited lower muscle cross-sectional area and muscle mass (p ≤ 0. 034; d ≥ 0. 79), yet higher muscle density (d ≥ 0. 28) than non-injured players. Differences between injured and non-injured limbs internal to injured players were also observed, with lower material (tibial mass and total vBMD), structural (cortical area and cortical thickness) and strength (stress-strain index and relative fracture load) in the injured limb comparative to the non-injured limb (d = 0. 20 – 0. 70). Muscle density was lower in the injured limb (d = 0. 54). The findings of this study illustrate a general inferiority and global musculoskeletal weakness in injured players, with non-injured players 10 - 12...|$|R
