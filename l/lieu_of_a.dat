Due to the influence of Laffoon and Rhea, the Democratic Party again chose a nominating convention in <b>lieu</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> primary to choose their gubernatorial candidate. Because Laffoon supporters controlled the state Democratic Central Committee and most of the county political organizations, a convention would favor Laffoon's choice of gubernatorial nominee.

After the Red Sox finished sixth in the American League in 1919, Frazee, needing money to finance a Broadway musical, No, No Nanette, sold pitcher-turned-outfielder Babe Ruth to the Yankees. Frazee received $125,000 and a loan of $300,000—secured on Fenway Park, the Red Sox' home stadium—for Ruth, despite Ruth having set the record for home runs with 29 in 1919. This {{began a series of}} deals with the Yankees that resulted in a long period of mediocrity for the Red Sox while the Yankees began their dynasty.|$|E
