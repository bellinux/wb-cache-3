50|$|The <b>little</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (Veniliornis passerinus) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Picidae, the woodpeckers, piculets, and wrynecks. It is found {{in a wide range}} of wooded {{habitats}} in a large part of South America east of the Andes, and generally common. Unlike other similar and comparably sized members of the genus Veniliornis, the <b>little</b> <b>woodpecker</b> lacks a contrasting yellow nape.|$|E
50|$|From {{its small}} size and its habit of {{spending}} most of its time in the tops of tall trees in woods and parks, this <b>little</b> <b>woodpecker</b> is often overlooked, but if sighted on a trunk it may at once be identified by the broad barring on the wings and narrower bars across the lower back.|$|E
50|$|The blood-coloured {{woodpecker}} is {{endemic to}} the lowland coastal forests of northern South America. Its range includes Guyana and Surinam, and possibly French Guiana; its {{status in the}} latter is unclear as it hybridises with the <b>little</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (Veniliornis sanguineus) where their ranges overlap. It is typically found in swampy and riverine forests, coastal mangrove forests, wooded savannah, cacao and coffee plantations, parks and occasionally gardens.|$|E
50|$|Woody {{is reading}} {{the story of}} Hansel and Gretel to his nephew Knothead and his niece Splinter. Neither of the kids seem to be interested, though, and walk out while Woody is still reading. However, the kids decide to act out the story by pretending to be Hansel and Gretel and {{purposely}} getting lost in the woods. A cat spots the two <b>little</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> and decides to catch and cook them. In order to capture Knothead and Splinter, the cat makes a gingerbread house (from a Ready-Mix Gingerbread House mix) and, through a straw, shoots Mexican Jumping Jelly Beans at the kids. The <b>little</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> eat the jelly beans, which send them jumping to the gingerbread house.|$|R
5000|$|Woody {{manages to}} stuff his Santa toy sack with {{food from the}} lodge, and starts singing and skiing {{his way down the}} mountain. However, upon opening the sack, Woody discovers a vengeful Wally Walrus who wrings the <b>little</b> <b>woodpecker's</b> neck in disgust and mocks Woody's [...] "ha-ha-ha-HA-ha".|$|R
50|$|As a result, the {{woodpeckers}} {{emerge from}} the oven alive, but before they can escape the cat catches Knothead by putting salt on his tail. Splinter puts the cat's tail in an egg beater {{in order to save}} Knothead and {{give him a chance to}} escape. Once he is free, Knothead takes the cat's tail and paints a facsimile of himself on it. The cat ends up putting his own tail into the oven and burns himself. For the finish, the <b>little</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> give the cat a bowl of soup with a firecracker in it, and make their escape back home.|$|R
40|$|Anomalous plumage colourations are {{reported}} for three species of non-passerine birds from Paraguay, Limpkin (Aramaus guarauna; Aramidae), Nanday Parakeet (Nandayus nenday; Psittacidae), and the <b>Little</b> <b>Woodpecker</b> (Veniliornis passerinus; Picidae). A leucistic Limpkin {{is the first}} published report of a colour anomaly for the family Aramidae. The colour aberration in N. nenday is hypothesised to {{be a result of}} an excess of red psittacofulvin pigments, which are unique to the Psittacidae. Although the mechanisms causing this colour aberration remain unknown, we suggest the term psittacofulvism for the phenotypic effect observed...|$|E
50|$|The <b>little</b> green <b>{{woodpecker}}</b> or golden-backed woodpecker (Campethera maculosa) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Picidae. It is found in Africa, living in forest edges, clearings, and forest-shrub mosaics. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as a least-concern species.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Three <b>Little</b> Woodpeckers", Woody <b>Woodpecker,</b> Knothead and Splinter are the Three Woodpeckers who {{are afraid}} of the Big Bad Wolf.|$|R
5000|$|The green-backed <b>woodpecker</b> or <b>little</b> spotted <b>woodpecker</b> (Campethera cailliautii), is {{a species}} of bird in the family Picidae. It is native to large parts of {{tropical}} central Africa. It has an extremely wide range and is an uncommon species, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|R
50|$|The <b>little</b> grey <b>woodpecker</b> is a {{very small}} woodpecker, growing to a length of between 12 and 14 cm. The beak is {{relatively}} long and broad. The male has a red hind crown and nape while the female lacks these. Otherwise the sexes are similar. The head is brown with a slight white supercilium and a narrow darker brown moustachial stripe. The upper parts of the body are greyish-brown barred with white and so are the wings and tail. The rump and upper tail coverts are red, which is particularly noticeable in flight. The beak is grey, the feet greenish-grey and the eye brown. Juveniles resemble adults but the general effect is duller. The plumage of the <b>little</b> grey <b>woodpecker,</b> especially the facial features, fade very rapidly and this bird can be confused with the brown-backed woodpecker (Dendropicos obsoletus). However, that species has a more distinctly contrasting brown and white head and plain brown plumage, and lacks the red rump.|$|R
50|$|The <b>little</b> green <b>woodpecker</b> {{is found}} in West Africa, in Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast and Ghana. Its range would extend east to South Sudan, Uganda, Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo if C. cailliautii permista were {{included}} in this species. Its habitat is edges of primary and secondary forests, clearings, and mosaics of forest and shrub, at elevations up to 1000 m.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>little</b> grey <b>woodpecker</b> (Dendropicos elachus), {{also known}} as the Sahelian woodpecker, is a species of bird in the family Picidae. It is found in Cameroon, Chad, Gambia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sudan. This species is {{described}} as somewhat rare, but it has a very large range and the population appears to be steady, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|R
50|$|The {{woodlands}} {{are mostly}} small with the deciduous trees dominated by oak. Here roe deer, badger, fire salamander, Aesculapian snake, middle spotted <b>woodpecker,</b> <b>little</b> owl and white admiral {{can be found}} and uncommon plants present including European columbine and wild russet apple.|$|R
50|$|Animals that inhabit this {{national}} park are moose, snowshoe hares, chipmunks, cormorants, red squirrels, pileated <b>woodpeckers,</b> <b>little</b> brown bats, peregrine falcons, black bears, coyotes, beavers, white-tailed deer, white-winged crossbills, various mice and shrews, juncos, sandpipers, raccoons, warblers, plovers, great blue herons, and northern flying squirrels.|$|R
50|$|For Centaur {{he created}} The Eye, Chuck Hardy, Dr. Hypno, and Solarman (no {{relation}} to the Marvel Comics superhero of the same name). Later in his career, he worked for Dell on The Owl, Billy and Bonnie Bee, Buddies and other characters. He wrote scripts for Andy Panda, <b>Little</b> Lulu, Woody <b>Woodpecker</b> and <b>Little</b> Scouts.|$|R
50|$|The brown-backed {{woodpecker}} {{is a small}} species, {{growing to}} a length of between 13 and 16 cm. The beak is long and chisel-tipped with a wide base. The male has a red hind crown and nape while the female lacks these. Otherwise the sexes are similar, the head is brown with a white supercilium and moustache and dark ear coverts. The body plumage is brown with white barring on the wings and tail and the underparts are whitish, with variable amounts of dark streaking. When the feathers are worn, this bird looks rather pale and can {{be confused with the}} <b>little</b> grey <b>woodpecker</b> (Dendropicos elachus).|$|R
50|$|The <b>little</b> green <b>woodpecker</b> {{is about}} 16 cm long and weighs about 54 g. The male's crown is olive-blackish with an indistinct reddish colour, and the nape is red. The head, neck and throat are buff, with brown spots. The upperparts are yellowish-green or bronze-green. The flight {{feathers}} are brown and have buffish bars. The tail is blackish, with some yellow and green. The underparts are buffish from the throat to the breast and greenish-white below the breast, {{all of the}} underparts having deep olive bars. The beak is olive or blackish, the eye is brown, and the legs are olive-grey. The female does not have red {{on the head and}} has buff spots on its crown and nape. The juvenile bird has greener upperparts with pale streaks, and its underparts are paler.|$|R
50|$|Government Island is a 1760 acre {{island in}} the Columbia River north of Portland, in Multnomah County, in the U.S. state of Oregon. Though Interstate 205 passes over it on the Glenn L. Jackson Memorial Bridge, access to the island is only by boat. There is a city {{controlled}} locked gate in the 205 fence. Government Island {{is known for its}} great blue heron colony and the Government Island State Recreation Area (primitive camping, beaches). The interior of the island, off limits to the public, contains a seasonal cattle ranch and protected natural areas, including Jewit Lake. There are also remnants of old pioneer buildings on the island. Camping is permitted below the vegetation line around the perimeter, and picnic tables and restrooms can be found in these areas as well. Many threatened or endangered wildlife species live on the island, including red-legged frog, pileated <b>woodpecker,</b> <b>little</b> willow flycatcher, olive-sided flycatcher, western meadowlark, horned grebe, red-necked grebe, bufflehead, purple martin, and possibly the endangered Columbian white-tailed deer.|$|R
