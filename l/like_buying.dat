This brand permits and even encourages people to substitute conscientious consumption and individual symbolic actions, <b>like</b> <b>buying</b> or wearing a pink ribbon, for concrete, practical results, such as collective political action aimed at discovering non-genetic causes of breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|A general {{economic}} {{idea is that}} if {{sales taxes}} are high enough, people start engaging in widespread tax evading activity (<b>like</b> <b>buying</b> over the Internet, {{pretending to be a}} business, buying at wholesale, buying products through an employer etc.). On the other hand, total VAT rates can rise above 10% without widespread evasion because of the novel collection mechanism. However, because of its particular mechanism of collection, VAT becomes quite easily the target of specific frauds like carousel fraud, which can be very expensive in terms of loss of tax incomes for states.|$|E

2500|$|Abaye {{said that}} because the law (in [...] and elsewhere) {{required}} the master to treat a Hebrew slave well — and as an equal in food, drink, and sleeping accommodations — {{it was said that}} buying a Hebrew slave was <b>like</b> <b>buying</b> a master. The Rabbis taught in a Baraita that the words of [...] regarding the Hebrew servant, [...] "he fares well with you," [...] indicate that the Hebrew servant had to be [...] "with" [...] — that is, equal to — the master in food and drink. Thus the master could not eat white bread and have the servant eat black bread. The master could not drink old wine and have the servant drink new wine. The master could not sleep on a feather bed and have the servant sleep on straw. Hence, they said that buying a Hebrew servant was <b>like</b> <b>buying</b> a master. Similarly, Rabbi Simeon deduced from the words of [...] "Then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him," [...] that the master was liable to provide for the servant's children until the servant went out. And Rabbi Simeon deduced from the words of [...] "If he is married, then his wife shall go out with him," [...] that the master was responsible to provide for the servant's wife, as well.|$|E
2500|$|The novel sparked {{discussion}} {{over the}} use of plastic surgery to improve one's looks. The author said he has “received many letters from girls who have decided against having surgery since reading Uglies,” while others, sparked by Uglies, have started to ponder the ethics of changing your body’s appearance. [...] Westerfeld has theorized that “having extreme cosmetic surgery will be <b>like</b> <b>buying</b> a $1,000 Gucci bag, an indication that you are a member of the privileged class." [...] Critics echo his opinion. However, Westerfeld has also stated he “wouldn’t hesitate [...] if he had a kid with port-wine stain. We have all been altering our appearances ever since clothing was invented.” Other critics have stated that while altering one's appearance with plastic surgery can be ethically debatable, the benefits of it to people who have need for it are tremendous.|$|E
2500|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} {{has many}} drawbacks, since it requires far {{more energy than}} asexual reproduction and diverts the organisms from other pursuits, {{and there is some}} argument about why so many species use it. George C. Williams used lottery tickets as an analogy in one explanation for the widespread use of sexual reproduction. He argued that asexual reproduction, which produces little or no genetic variety in offspring, was <b>like</b> <b>buying</b> many tickets that all have the same number, limiting the chance of [...] "winning" [...] - that is, producing surviving offspring. Sexual reproduction, he argued, was like purchasing fewer tickets but with a greater variety of numbers and therefore a greater chance of success. The point of this analogy is that since asexual reproduction does not produce genetic variations, there is little ability to quickly adapt to a changing environment. The lottery principle is less accepted these days because of evidence that asexual reproduction is more prevalent in unstable environments, the opposite of what it predicts.|$|E

40|$|We {{relate the}} {{property}} rights {{theory of the}} firm to empirical regularities {{in the market for}} mergers and acquisitions. We first show that high market-to-book acquirers typically do not purchase low market-to-book targets. Instead, mergers pair together firms with similar ratios. We then build a continuous-time model of investment and merger activity combining search, scarcity, and asset complementarity to explain this <b>like</b> <b>buys</b> <b>like</b> result. We test the model by relating like-buys-like to search frictions. Search frictions and assortative matching vary inversely, supporting the model over standard explanations.

2500|$|Advertisers {{and retail}} {{consultants}} {{have said that}} because of consumer cynicism, a company can benefit from marketing its support for a cause such as breast cancer awareness only when the company treats that support as [...] "a commitment and not a marketing opportunity". Andrew Benett, an executive at Euro RSCG said that because consumers [...] "have become more mindful, more thoughtful, about how they consume, where they consume, why they consume", companies cannot succeed by [...] "just slapping a pink ribbon on a product and [...] people will buy more". [...] Pink products have also been condemned as promoting consumerism, materialism, and environmental degradation. Critics are also concerned that the ubiquity of pink products may mislead people into thinking that significant progress has been made, and that small, individual actions, <b>like</b> <b>buying</b> a breast cancer-themed product, are sufficient. Responding to criticism, Komen CEO Nancy G. Brinker said that corporate promotions enabled the organization to reach new audiences and that [...] "America is built on consumerism. To say we shouldn't use it to solve the social ills that confront us doesn't make sense to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{comprehensive}} {{examination of the}} KLF's announcement and its context, Select called it [...] "the last grand gesture, the most heroic act of public self destruction {{in the history of}} pop. And it's also Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty's final extravagant howl of self disgust, defiance and contempt for a music world gone foul and corrupt." [...] Many of the KLF's friends and collaborators gave their reactions in the magazine. Movie director Bill Butt said that [...] "Like everything, they're dealing with it in a very realistic way, a fresh, unbitter way, which is very often not the case. A lot of bands disappear with such a terrible loss of dignity". Scott Piering said that [...] "They've got a huge buzz off this, that's for sure, because it's something that's finally thrilling. It's scary to have thrown away a fortune which I know they have. Just the idea of starting over is exciting. Starting over on what? Well, they have such great ideas, <b>like</b> <b>buying</b> submarines". Even Kenny Gates, who as a director of the KLF's distributors APT stood to lose financially from the move, called it [...] "Conceptually and philosophically... absolutely brilliant". Mark Stent reported the doubts of many when he said that [...] "I [...] had so many people who I know, heads of record companies, A men saying, 'Come on, It's a big scam.' But I firmly believe it's over". [...] "For the very last spectacularly insane time", the magazine concluded, [...] "The KLF have done what was least expected of them".|$|E
