It is in the form of a petition addressed to the judge of the court by name, setting forth the nature and facts of the claim and containing a prayer that process issue in the proper manner.

5000|$|This 1881 case decided {{ownership}} of a dead finback whale (Balaenoptera physalus). The whale was killed by the <b>libellant</b> (plaintiff) Ghenâ€™s bomb lance. The whale washed up on the shore 17 miles from Cape Cod and was found by Ellis, who then auctioned off the whale to Rich, the defendant. Finback whales generally sink after being killed, and it takes time for the whale to resurface. According to the custom of the time, dead whales were retrieved from the shore after 2-3 days, and the finder identified the whaling company that had made the kill from the unique mark of the bomb lance. The finder would then notify the whaling company by communicating with Provincetown and in return receive a finder's fee. In this case, {{it was unclear whether}} the whaler or the person who discovered the washed up whale owned the animal.|$|E

2500|$|Construction of the Corwin was {{contracted}} in May 1875 with completion {{scheduled for}} February 28, 1876. Captain John W. White was construction superintendent for the Revenue Cutter Service. [...] The Corwin {{was the first}} government vessel constructed {{in the state of}} Oregon, and a large crowd came out to see her launched August 23, 1876. Oregon Iron Works became insolvent that fall and was declared bankrupt; this resulted in liens filed against the vessel by suppliers and subcontractors for unpaid bills. [...] On January 2, 1877, Judge J. Deady of the U.S District Court, Oregon District ruled that the lien of <b>libellants</b> Coffin and Hendry was valid, that the government was not yet the owner of the vessel and had not been in possession when the vessel was seized by the marshal on November 29. [...] However, the Corwin had been extricated about January 1, 1877 by Captain White and the USRC Rush and moved {{to the middle of the}} Columbia River (another source has this about January 10). [...] The Government appealed Judge Deady's ruling and Coffin and Hendry withdrew their claim on the basis of assurances that they would be paid faster if they settled. After a flurry of unsuccessful legal actions by other claimants, the Corwin was [...] removed to San Francisco where she was completed at a cost of $10150.77 and subsequently commissioned. Congress was still considering suppliers and workmen's claims in 1884.|$|R
