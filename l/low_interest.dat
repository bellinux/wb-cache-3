5|$|In {{the opening}} of his speech in the General Council of Senegal, {{governor}} Henri de Lamothe proposed that the country should take a loan for infrastructure development. The council agreed on a loan worth five million gold francs, {{much of the money}} being {{for the construction of a}} metallic bridge between Saint-Louis and Sor. The loan was approved on November 2, 1892, by the French president Marie François Sadi Carnot. A French bank, CDG, agreed to give the loan with a <b>low</b> <b>interest</b> of only four percent.|$|E
5|$|President Bush {{declared}} Louisiana {{a federal}} disaster area after the storm, making it eligible for assistance. FEMA set up three locations to apply in Mississippi and Louisiana. Applications began pouring in, 153,000 {{by the time}} of the deadline. Over $311million in aid was granted to Louisiana. A total of $50million of that money was in the form of <b>low</b> <b>interest</b> loans, and not actual grants.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s {{crime rates}} started to drop {{dramatically}} due to revised police strategies, improving economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, both American transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America. Murder rates that had reached 2,245 in 1990 plummeted to 537 by 2008, and the crack epidemic {{and its associated}} drug-related violence came under greater control. The outflow of population turned around, as the city once again became the destination of immigrants from around the world, joining with <b>low</b> <b>interest</b> rates and Wall Street bonuses to fuel {{the growth of the}} real estate market. Important new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged in Manhattan's economy.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Harding took office, there were calls from foreign governments for {{reduction}} of the massive war debt owed to the United States, and the German government sought to reduce the reparations that it was required to pay. The U.S. refused to consider any multilateral settlement. Harding sought passage of a plan proposed by Mellon to give the administration broad authority to reduce war debts in negotiation, but Congress, in 1922, passed a more restrictive bill. Hughes negotiated an agreement for Britain to pay off its war debt over 62 years at <b>low</b> <b>interest,</b> effectively reducing {{the present value of}} the obligations. This agreement, approved by Congress in 1923, set a pattern for negotiations with other nations. Talks with Germany on reduction of reparations payments would result in the Dawes Plan of 1924.|$|E
5|$|Government policy {{designed}} to promote affordable housing, widespread failures in corporate and regulatory governance, and historically <b>low</b> <b>interest</b> rates set by the Federal Reserve led to the mid-2000s housing bubble, which culminated with the 2008 financial crisis, the largest economic contraction in the nation's history since the Great Depression. Barack Obama, the first African American and multiracial president, was elected in 2008 amid the crisis, and subsequently passed stimulus measures and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act {{in an attempt to}} mitigate its negative effects and ensure there would not be a repeat of the crisis. The stimulus facilitated infrastructure improvements and a relative decline in unemployment. Dodd-Frank improved financial stability and consumer protection, although there is evidence it may have had a negative impact on small banks.|$|E
5|$|On September 26, the {{affected}} residents began receiving housing assistance grants, totaling $4.3million in aid. By {{a month after}} the hurricane passed through the area, disaster aid amounted to just over $30million (2003USD, ($ USD). Ultimately, aid in the state totalled just under $100million ($ USD). Business owners applied for 14,595loans and received $53.4million ($ USD) in <b>low</b> <b>interest</b> loans from the Small Business Administration. The state also received more than $16.9million in funds (2003USD, ($ USD) to rebuild infrastructure damaged by Isabel. 17,855residents applied to receive more than $20.8million ($ USD) in housing assistance, and $8million (2003USD, ($ USD) in assistance for other needs such as personal property, transportation and medical expenses.|$|E

5|$|The CCF {{represented}} many {{agricultural areas}} in the Commons, and it proposed several measures to assure financial security for farmers. It proposed national growers' cooperatives for agricultural products which were exported. It proposed cash advances for farm-stored wheat, {{short and long term}} loans for farmers at <b>low</b> <b>interest</b> rates, and government support of prices, to assure the farmer a full income even in bad years. For the Atlantic fisherman, the CCF proposed cash advances {{at the start of the}} fishing season and government-owned depots which would sell fishing equipment and supplies to fishermen at much lower than market prices.|$|E
5|$|While {{none of the}} {{affected}} counties or cities {{declared a state of}} emergency following the event, the Small Business Administration did approve a request by the Office of Emergency Services for a disaster declaration in late September. This formality paved the way for <b>low</b> <b>interest</b> loans for commercial or residential properties that suffered damage, but only about 50 claims were expected. Local authorities had trained for disasters on a regular basis, and the response to the light damage was considered smooth, though some officials sought room for improvement. Discussions followed the event, with local governments focusing on telecommunication problems, emergency power systems, and seismic safety.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Taiwan flooding in Kaohsiung, officials deployed 7,888troops to the southern portion of the island to assist in rescue and recovery work. Soldiers also set up five medical centers, and utilized amphibious vehicles to rescue people in flooded areas. Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou toured the flooded regions on September23, emphasizing that efforts to drain the flooding should be the main priority. More than 100buildings in Kaohsiung required water pumps and thousands of volunteers to remove standing water from basements and streets. The mayor Kiku Chen temporarily suspended her reelection campaign due to the floods. About 80% of the factories in Kaohsiung were reopened by September21. The high crop damage allowed farmers to qualify for <b>low</b> <b>interest</b> loans. Rail lines took two weeks to reopen due to damage. Power and water service was restored {{within days of the}} storm, although residents in flooded areas were advised to boil water before usage. There was also an increase in dengue fever after the floods. The Red Cross Society of China donated about US$100,000 {{in the days after the}} storm. The government announced on September20 that families affected by the floods would receive NT$30,000 (US$945.92) per house. Throughout Taiwan, exports during September 2010 decreased 6.9% from August's levels due to the storm and an industrial fire.|$|E

5|$|Meisdalshagen became {{involved}} in politics while attending school in Voss, and chaired the Labour Party chapter in Nord-Aurdal from 1927 to 1940. He also chaired the local chapters of Valdres, from 1930 to 1932, and Fagernes, from 1931 to 1934. From 1931 to 1940 he was {{a board member of}} the Labour Party county chapter. He was elected as a member of Nord-Aurdal municipal council in 1931, and was re-elected to serve until 1940. From 1934 he served in the council's executive committee. He spent his professional life in Fagernes, where he had opened an attorney's office in 1933. He also headed the municipal board of arbitration in debt matters, from 1935 to 1940. This had a significant influence on his further political career, in that he sought to improve the economy of rural Norwegian districts, especially through a centralized increase of farmers' income. He also favoured ensuring a <b>low</b> <b>interest,</b> preferably at 2,5%.|$|E
5|$|The ECB targets {{interest}} rates rather than exchange rates {{and in general}} does not intervene on the foreign exchange rate markets. This {{is because of the}} implications of the Mundell–Fleming model, which implies a central bank cannot (without capital controls) maintain interest rate and exchange rate targets simultaneously, because increasing the money supply results in a depreciation of the currency. In the years following the Single European Act, the EU has liberalised its capital markets, and as the ECB has chosen monetary autonomy, the exchange-rate regime of the euro is flexible, or floating. The result of the ECB maintaining historically <b>low</b> <b>interest</b> rates and restricting money supply has been that over the last decade the euro has become expensive relative to the currency of Europe's main trading partners. However, in 2010, the euro started on a sharp decline. Starting at U.S$1.60 in 2008, and dropping to US$1.04 in 2015.In the following months € recovered till the value of 1.19 U.S.$. The Canadian dollar in the long term had a decline against €.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{few days}} after the {{hurricane}} passed, the Grenada Emergency Operations Center temporarily prevented relief supplies from entering the country to ensure the safety of the incoming items; the decision was reversed shortly thereafter, and planes flew supplies during daylight hours into the reopened airport. Severe looting occurred in the immediate aftermath of Ivan, prompting police officials to enact a curfew for the night hours. In the first week following the hurricane, aid was slow to the affected residents, due to the lack of an efficient aid distribution system. 30official shelters and 17prepared ones housed over 5,000people in the aftermath of the storm. Thousands of people lost their jobs due to the hurricane, with all businesses shut down following the hurricane. By two months after the hurricane struck, 65schools were opened, some of which serving as shelters; water and power were gradually restored to the island. By a year after the storm's passage, all schools were reopened, and most buildings enacted provisional repairs. Officials determined around 10,000houses on the island required complete reconstruction, while a further 22,000 needed repairs. The government of Grenada initially planned to rebuild 1,000houses in the year after the hurricane struck; by June 2005, 260families were provided houses, with a further 85under construction. The government also established a Material Assistance Programme, which provided $5,000 (2004XCD) of free materials to more than 5,000families, as well as a total of $4.3million (2004XCD) in <b>low</b> <b>interest</b> loans to 148families. Several indirect fatalities occurred in the aftermath of the hurricane, primarily senior citizens.|$|E
40|$|Despite huge Japanese public debt, {{some argue}} that <b>low</b> JGB <b>interest</b> rates imply that Japanese fiscal {{construction}} is not urgent. In this paper, I consider several factors behind the <b>low</b> JGB <b>interest</b> rates. First, using Barro (2006, 2009) ’s rare disaster models with the projected probability and size of economic damage of great earthquakes in Japan, I show that the <b>low</b> safe <b>interest</b> rates may reflect larger risk aversion and/or larger risks. Also, the large convenience yields may explain the <b>low</b> JGB <b>interest</b> rates. However, these {{are based on the}} belief that Japanese government will take drastic tax increases and expenditure cuts to recover fiscal sustainability. If the default risk is recognized, high risk aversion and loss of large convenience yields imply that interest rates can jump up. In my estimation, when the default risk of JGBs in rare disasters is recognized, their interest rates can rise above 7 %. Further, some of the policies that effectively worked as financial repression policies (such as heavy safe asset investment by GPIF) will change in near future. In conclusion, <b>low</b> JGB <b>interest</b> rates do not imply that fiscal reconstruction is not urgent in Japan...|$|R

50|$|Consequently, {{this had}} an adverse impact on whole Japanese asset bubble. Firstly, cheap and easily {{available}} loans reduced the funding {{costs for the}} purpose of speculation. Second, stock rises, coupled by <b>low</b> <b>interests</b> rates, reduced the capital costs and aided financing the capital market (e.g. convertible bonds, bonds with warrants, etc.). Third, the combination of a rise in land and stock prices pushed up the value of assets held by corporations, which effectively increased their sources of funding since such these increased the collateral value of the assets.|$|R
