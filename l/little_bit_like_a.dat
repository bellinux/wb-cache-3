500|$|In 1978 Gravel blocked passage, via {{procedural}} delays such {{as walking}} out of House-Senate conference committee meetings, of a complex bill which represented a compromise on land use policy. The bill would have put some of Alaska's vast federal land holdings under state control while preserving other portions for federal parks and refuges; the action would earn Gravel the enmity of fellow Alaska Senator Ted Stevens. In 1980, a new lands bill came up for consideration, that was less favorable to Alaskan interests and more liked by environmentalists; it set aside [...] of Alaska's [...] for national parks, conservation areas, and other restricted federal uses. Gravel blocked it, as not ensuring enough future development in the state. A new compromise {{version of the bill}} came forward, which reduced the land set aside to [...] Gravel, in representation of Alaskan interests, tried to stop the bill, including staging a filibuster. The Senate, however, voted cloture and then passed the bill.

500|$|By December 2013, Madonna's manager Guy Oseary {{commented that}} the singer was [...] "eager to get started" [...] on her next album. However, she had another project in mind – {{developing}} the screenplay for the Andrew Sean Greer novel, The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells. Madonna decided to split her time between writing the screenplay and writing songs for the new album. In February 2014, Madonna confirmed that she had already begun working on her thirteenth studio album, saying: [...] "I'm {{right now in the}} process of talking to various co-writers and producers and talking about where I want to go with my music". Working with a number of collaborators on the album, Madonna encountered problems in keeping a cohesive sound and creative direction for Rebel Heart, since her previous efforts had been produced with only a small core group of people developing the music. She observed that a lot of the people she enlisted would not stay in one city at a time due to their different projects, resulting in Madonna not finishing her songs. [...] "So, I was just the person standing there with a clipboard in the headlights, going 'Ok!' A <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> school teacher," [...] she admitted.|$|E

40|$|First of all, I {{would like}} to thank my {{supervisor}} Gerhard Lakemeyer for several reasons. He convinced me to start the quest on mobile robots and with this giving me this great opportunity and experience of being part of the RoboCup project. During the recent years he always gave the right advice at the right time in his very subtle way. His way of giving sublte (mostly) reinforcement (positive as well as negative) very much enforced my scientific education and development, and I {{would like to}} thank him for the trust that our efforts will come to some good end, and for his patience and understanding that sometimes making things run in reality takes longer than expected. In this context I have to underline that I am very grateful for his respect of the practical work we have done during the last years. His passion to sit in early morning hours with the RoboCup team to debug something at some tournament site is well remembered. Finally, I {{would like to thank}} him for his valuable comments on earlier versions of this thesis, helping to make it a coherent and hopefully (formally) sound document. I am grateful to Michael Beetz who kindly accepted the task of the second reviewer of this thesis. I’m indebted to many people supporting this work during the last years. It may sound <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> acceptance speech at the Grammys, but I do owe a lot to the following people. ...|$|R

5000|$|This feeling can be {{compared}} to wandering through a gallery and encountering surprising artworks, much like Counts wandered through the galleries of the Metropolitan Museum of Art as a child.

40|$|Way {{back in the}} 1960 s, an era {{in which}} many people think we are still mired, we each made a career {{decision}} to be lawyers for poor people. While the road over the past thirty-five years has taken several twists and turns, we are still lawyers for poor people. When we started on this road, we believed that we were making a political decision—that lawyering on behalf of poor people meant representing the oppressed against entrenched interests, including the state. While we may no longer say things like 2 ̆ 2 when the revolution comes 2 ̆ 2 (well, sometimes we do), we still believe that choosing to represent the poor is a political choice with dramatic consequences in the nature of one 2 ̆ 7 s work. Adam Babich may disagree, but the work of the Tulane Law School 2 ̆ 7 s Environmental Law Clinic proves our point. Professor Babich describes the clinic 2 ̆ 7 s environmentalist work on behalf of the unenfranchised and calls it apolitical.
