5|$|Although {{reference}} to major morphological {{categories such as}} root, stem, <b>leaf,</b> <b>and</b> trichome are useful, one has {{to keep in mind}} that these categories are linked through intermediate forms so that a continuum between the categories results. Furthermore, structures can be seen as processes, that is, process combinations.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{compound}} {{leaves of}} flowering plants are partially homologous both to leaves and shoots, because their development {{has evolved from}} a genetic mosaic of <b>leaf</b> <b>and</b> shoot development.|$|E

2500|$|The {{rivalry between}} the Maple <b>Leafs</b> <b>and</b> Red Wings {{was at its}} height during the Original Six-era (1942–67), with the {{majority}} of Maple <b>Leafs</b> <b>and</b> Red Wings postseason meetings occurring in this period. The Maple <b>Leafs</b> <b>and</b> Red Wings met in the postseason six times during the 1940s, including four Stanley Cup finals. The Maple Leafs beat the Red Wings in five of their six meetings, except in the 1943 semifinals. In the 1950s, the Maple <b>Leafs</b> <b>and</b> Red Wings met one another in six Stanley Cup semifinals; the Red Wings beat the Maple Leafs in five of their six meetings, excluding the 1960 semifinals. From 1961 to 1967, the two teams met one another in three playoff series, including two Stanley Cup finals. Within those 25 years, the Maple <b>Leafs</b> <b>and</b> Red Wings played a total of 15 postseason series including six Cup Finals; the Maple Leafs beat the Red Wings in all six Cup Finals.|$|R

5|$|A.viridimontanum is {{difficult}} to distinguish from its parent species in the field. It can generally be separated from A.pedatum by {{the shape of the}} ultimate segments (the smallest divisions of the <b>leaf),</b> <b>and</b> by its habitat on thin, exposed serpentine soils rather than in rich woodlands. It more closely resembles A.aleuticum; however, the stalks of the ultimate segments and the false indusia are longer and the spores larger.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{had three}} wives. He married {{his first wife}} Ásíyih Khánum, the {{daughter}} of a nobleman, in Tehran in 1835, when he was 18 and she was 15. She was given the title of The Most Exalted <b>Leaf</b> <b>and</b> Navváb. His second wife was his widowed cousin Fátimih Khánum. The marriage took place in Tehran in 1849 when she was 21 and he was 32. She was known as Mahd-i-`Ulyá. His third wife was Gawhar Khánum and the marriage occurred in Baghdad sometime before 1863.|$|E
5|$|Captive crickets are omnivorous; when {{deprived}} of their natural diet, they accept {{a wide range of}} organic foodstuffs. Some species are completely herbivorous, feeding on flowers, fruit, and leaves, with ground-based species consuming seedlings, grasses, pieces of <b>leaf,</b> <b>and</b> the shoots of young plants. Others are more predatory and include in their diet invertebrate eggs, larvae, pupae, moulting insects, scale insects, and aphids. Many are scavengers and consume various organic remains, decaying plants, seedlings, and fungi. In captivity, many species have been successfully reared on a diet of ground, commercial dry dog food, supplemented with lettuce and aphids.|$|E

40|$|<b>Leaf</b> area <b>and</b> <b>leaf</b> weight {{measurements}} {{are required to}} calculate several growth indices, which are leaf area index (LAI), net assimilation rate (NAR), specific leaf area (SLA), specific <b>leaf</b> weight (SLW), <b>and</b> <b>leaf</b> area duration (LAD). We developed three predictive equations to estimate leaf area, <b>leaf</b> fresh <b>and</b> dry weight in maize from <b>leaf</b> length <b>and</b> <b>leaf</b> width measurements. A total of 1, 314 leaves {{from different parts of}} plants at different plant growth stages, different planting densities and different sowing dates were collected in 2008 at the Agricultural Research Center near Gorgan, Golestan, Iran. To evaluate the equations, some goodness of fit indicators used included mean absolute error, root mean square error and index of agreement. This study found strong relationships between <b>leaf</b> length <b>and</b> <b>leaf</b> width <b>and</b> LA, LFW and LDW (R 2 > 0. 85). Based on the results LA, LFW and LDW of individual maize leaves can be estimated non-destructively by <b>leaf</b> length <b>and</b> <b>leaf</b> width. These equations allow the research workers to make non-destructive or repeat measurements on the same leaves. The general equation to estimate LA, LFW, and LDW was: Ln (Y) = a + b Ln (L) + c Ln (W...|$|R
5|$|Doctor Eggman (Mike Pollock) opens an {{amusement}} park in space called Dr. Eggman's Incredible Interstellar Amusement Park, allegedly turning over a new <b>leaf</b> <b>and</b> making up for past transgressions.

They meet Yacker, who comes from a species of aliens known as Wisps. After Tails invents a translator to communicate with him, they learn that other Wisps have been enslaved by Eggman, who plans to harness their energy for a mind-control laser that will allow him to take over Earth.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, {{researchers}} at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston found that plants {{can be a}} vector for prions. When researchers fed hamsters grass that grew on ground where a deer that died with chronic wasting disease (CWD) was buried, the hamsters became ill with CWD, suggesting that prions can bind to plants, which then take them up into the <b>leaf</b> <b>and</b> stem structure, {{where they can be}} eaten by herbivores, thus completing the cycle. It is thus possible that there is a progressively accumulating number of prions in the environment.|$|E

5|$|Violet {{root rot}} {{caused by the}} fungus Helicobasidium purpureum {{sometimes}} affects the roots, covering them with a purplish mat to which soil particles adhere. The leaves become distorted and discolored and the mycelium can spread through the soil between plants. Some weeds can harbour this fungus and it is more prevalent in wet, acid conditions. Erysiphe heraclei causes a powdery mildew that can cause significant crop loss. Infestation by this causes results in yellowing of the <b>leaf</b> <b>and</b> loss of foliage. Moderate temperatures and high humidity favor {{the development of the}} disease.|$|E
5|$|As the Big Ten {{champion}}, Michigan {{faced the}} Pac-10 champion Washington State Cougars in the 1998 Rose Bowl. The game matched the nation's best {{defense against the}} number two offense. Michigan's defense allowed an average of 206.9 yards per game through the regular season, while Washington State averaged 42.5 points and 502.1 yards a game. Washington State, which featured quarterback Ryan <b>Leaf</b> <b>and</b> a five-wideout offense, had established Pac-10 passing records with 3,637 yards and 33 touchdowns. The game marked Michigan's first Rose Bowl since 1993 and Washington State's first since 1931. Going into the game, Michigan held a 68–1 and 53.5–8.5 first place vote lead in the AP and Coaches Polls over fellow unbeaten Nebraska, respectively. The national television broadcast of the game featured announcers Bob Griese, the father of Michigan's quarterback, and Keith Jackson, a Washington State alumnus and former radio and television announcer for the Cougars.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{body was}} embalmed at Berkeley Castle, {{where it was}} viewed by local leaders from Bristol and Gloucester. It was then taken to Gloucester Abbey on 21 October, and on 20 December Edward was buried by the high altar, the funeral having {{probably}} been delayed to allow Edward III to attend in person. Gloucester was probably chosen because other abbeys had refused or been forbidden to take the King's body, {{and because it was}} close to Berkeley. The funeral was a grand affair and cost £351 in total, complete with gilt lions, standards painted with gold <b>leaf</b> <b>and</b> oak barriers to manage the anticipated crowds. Edward III's government probably hoped to put a veneer of normality over the recent political events, increasing the legitimacy of the young King's own reign.|$|E

5|$|Kerala cuisine has a {{multitude}} of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes prepared using fish, poultry, and meat. Culinary spices have been cultivated in Kerala for millennia and they are characteristic of its cuisine. Rice is a dominant staple that is eaten at all times of day. A majority of the breakfast foods in Kerala are made out of rice, {{in one form or}} the other (idli, puttu, appam, or idiyappam), tapioca preparations, or pulse-based vada. These may be accompanied by chutney, kadala, payasam, payar pappadam, appam, chicken curry, beef fry, egg masala and fish curry. Lunch dishes include rice and curry along with rasam, pulisherry and sambar. Sadhya is a vegetarian meal, which is served on a banana <b>leaf</b> <b>and</b> followed with a cup of payasam. Popular snacks include banana chips, yam crisps, tapioca chips, unniyappam and kuzhalappam. Seafood specialties include karimeen, prawns, shrimp and other crustacean dishes.|$|E
5|$|Saddles {{were made}} of wood and were {{designed}} as a standing platform for archers. They were not suited for riding long distances or at high speed. Early saddles of the Nara period were of Chinese style karagura and later modified for local tastes, resulting in Japanese style saddles from the Heian period onward. Artisans and carpenters {{became involved in the}} saddle production as saddles became more elaborate in the Kamakura period, with decorations in mother of pearl inlay, gold <b>leaf</b> <b>and</b> multiple coats of lacquer. Saddles ceased to be primarily utilitarian, instead serving as adornment showing the owner's status in processions. Three Japanese style lacquered wooden saddles and a complete set of a Chinese style ritual saddle, dating to the late Heian and Kamakura periods, have been designated as National Treasures.|$|E
