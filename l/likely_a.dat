5|$|A shot rang out. It was <b>likely</b> <b>a</b> {{warning shot}} fired by a panicked, {{exhausted}} British soldier from the 43rd, according to Captain Laurie's report to his commander after the fight. Two other regulars then fired immediately after that, shots splashing in the river, {{and then the}} narrow group up front, possibly thinking the order to fire had been given, fired a ragged volley before Laurie could stop them.|$|E
5|$|According to Ottfried Neubecker, the bey of Tunis {{also had}} his own flag. This flag was most <b>likely</b> <b>a</b> simple {{personal}} banner of the ruler, as it floated above the Bardo Palace, the Citadel of Tunis, on navy ships, {{and also in the}} center of the coat of arms in Tunisia. It was used at a number of public ceremonies—including at the proclamation of the Ottoman constitution on 21 March 1840—until the abolition of the Bey monarchy on 25 July 1957.|$|E

5|$|According to {{historian}} John V. A.

He was perhaps elevated to the position of despot of Vidin soon after the accession of another Bulgarian noble of Cuman origin, George Terter I (r. 1280–1292), to the Bulgarian throne in 1280. Shishman was <b>likely</b> <b>a</b> close relative, perhaps even a brother, of George Terter I.|$|E
5|$|Available {{evidence}} indicates that the real Lad was born in December 1902 and passed through the hands {{of at least two}} owners before coming to Sunnybank.

5|$|Based on its size, the {{morphology}} of its molars, and microwear {{analysis on}} its teeth, Babakotia radofilai was <b>likely</b> <b>a</b> folivore, while supplementing its diet with fruit and hard seeds.

The belief was that for an infant to survive a caesarian section was a miracle, and thus a fitting beginning for a future saint.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 581 is {{classified}} as a variable star of the BY Draconis type, and has been given the variable star designation HO Librae. This is a star that exhibits variability {{because of the presence}} of star spots combined with the rotation of the star. However, the measured variability is close to the margin of error, and, if real, is most <b>likely</b> <b>a</b> long term variability. Its brightness is stable to 1%. Gliese 581 emits X-rays.|$|E
5|$|HIP 78530 b is most <b>likely</b> <b>a</b> brown dwarf, {{a massive}} object that {{is large enough}} to fuse {{deuterium}} (something that planets are too small to do) but not large enough to ignite and become a star. Because HIP 78530 b's characteristics blend the line between {{whether or not it is}} a brown dwarf or a planet, astronomers have tried to determine what HIP 78530 b is by predicting whether it was created in a planet-like or star-like (how brown dwarves are formed) manner.|$|E

5|$|Named Alchiba, Alpha Corvi is a white-hued star of {{spectral}} type F1V {{and magnitude}} 4.0, 48.7 ± 0.1 light-years from Earth.
