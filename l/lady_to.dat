5|$|On LGBT rights, she {{supported}} {{the right to}} same-sex marriage. Clinton first expressed support for a national right to same-sex marriage in 2013; in 2000, she had been against such unions altogether and in 2006, she said only that she would support a state's decision to permit same-sex marriages. In 2000, {{she was the first}} First <b>Lady</b> <b>to</b> march in an LGBT pride parade. In 2016, she was the first major-party presidential candidate ever to write an op-ed for an LGBT newspaper (Philadelphia Gay News).|$|E
5|$|The Bushes {{had tried}} to {{conceive}} for three years, but pregnancy did not happen easily. On November 25, 1981, Laura Bush gave birth to fraternal twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna. The twins were born five weeks early by an emergency Caesarean section, as Laura had developed life-threatening pre-eclampsia (toxemia). The twins {{graduated from high school}} in 2000 and attended Yale University and the University of Texas at Austin, respectively, in 2004. To date, Bush is the only First <b>Lady</b> <b>to</b> have given birth to twins.|$|E
5|$|Courtly {{love was}} the eroticisation of love between the nobility. Emphasis {{was placed on}} {{restraint}} between lovers. Though sometimes expressed through chivalric events such as tournaments, where knights would fight wearing a token from their lady, {{it could also be}} private and conducted in secret. The legend of Tristan and Iseult is one example of stories of courtly love told in the Middle Ages. It was an ideal of love between two people not married to each other, although the man might be married to someone else. It was not uncommon or ignoble for a lord to be adulterous– Henry I of England had over 20bastards for instance– but for a <b>lady</b> <b>to</b> be promiscuous was seen as dishonourable.|$|E

Following her parents' disappearance, she became a courier for resistance forces in Northern Italy, as well as helping to print and distribute antigovernment pamphlets. On one occasion, she dressed as a cleaning <b>lady</b> <b>to</b> steal letterhead from government offices {{so that it could}} be used to forge letters of safe passage to Switzerland. Due to her energy and small size (she never grew to more than five feet tall), she received the nickname Topolino ("Little Mouse").|$|E

Clinton became the only First <b>Lady</b> <b>to</b> serve in the Cabinet and the third female Secretary of State. Napolitano became the first female Secretary of Homeland Security. Barack Obama has appointed eight women to Cabinet positions, {{the most of any}} Presidency, surpassing George W. Bush's record of six.|$|E

For her first Thanksgiving in the White House, Pat organized a meal for 225 senior citizens who did not have families. The following year, she invited wounded servicemen to a second annual Thanksgiving meal in the White House. Though presidents since George Washington had been issuing Thanksgiving proclamations, Pat became the only First <b>Lady</b> <b>to</b> issue one.|$|E
5|$|The Master and Mistress buy {{a female}} collie puppy named <b>Lady</b> <b>to</b> be Lad's {{companion}} and mate. Lad becomes her protector and slave, as she bullies {{him from his}} food and {{the best places to}} lie, and endures the flashes of nasty temper that lead her to bite his ears and paws. As she grows older, she becomes a generally well-behaved house dog, but when she is eight months old, she tries to attack a beloved mounted bald eagle belonging to the Master. He whips her and then locks her in a shed for the night as punishment; however, during the night it catches on fire. Lad desperately tries to break down the door to free her, then howls in agony, before jumping through its high window to join Lady inside. The Master, awakened by Lad's howl, arrives in time to free them both, though both have badly burned coats.|$|E

Clinton took the oath of office of Secretary of State, resigning from the Senate later that day. She became the first former first <b>lady</b> <b>to</b> serve in the United States Cabinet.|$|E

5|$|When Bill Clinton {{took office}} as President in January 1993, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the First Lady and her press {{secretary}} reiterated {{that she would}} be using that form of her name. She was the first inaugural First <b>Lady</b> <b>to</b> have earned a postgraduate degree and to have her own professional career up to the time of entering the White House. She was also the first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing. She was part of the innermost circle vetting appointments to the new administration and her choices filled at least eleven top-level positions and dozens more lower-level ones. After Eleanor Roosevelt, Clinton was regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in American history.|$|E
5|$|The Whitewater {{controversy}} was {{the focus}} of media attention from the publication of a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential campaign and throughout her time as first lady. The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation; at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses. Madison Guaranty later failed and Clinton's work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators that her husband had appointed. She said she had done minimal work for the bank. Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton's legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were. The records were found in the First Lady's White House book room after a two-year search and delivered to investigators in early 1996. The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been. Clinton's staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor's Mansion. On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first first <b>lady</b> <b>to</b> be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury. After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.|$|E
