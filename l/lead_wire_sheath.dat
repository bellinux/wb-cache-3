40|$|For {{calculations}} and measurements of transient characteristics of groundings, {{the current and}} potential <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> are frequently used accordingly to inject the current into the grounding and find the grounding potential rise (GPR). The results of the {{calculations and}} measurements can be dependent on {{the location of the}} current and potential <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> due to mutual influence between them and the grounding wire. It is important to determine to what extent the location of the wires influences the calculation results for the grounding with a simple configuration. Notably, in contrast to the measurements, for the calculations it is possible to locate wires vertically, also the potential <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> can be replaced by the integral of the electric field. For the calculations the finite difference time domain method (FDTD) has been used in the work. In order to estimate to what extent the calculated GPR can be influenced by location of the wires, calculations with different wires locations have been carried out. An analysis of the calculation results has been made. There are calculation methods in which the injection of the current and calculation of the GPR are performed without the current and potential <b>lead</b> <b>wires.</b> The method based on the telegrapher's equations is one of such methods. In order to determine what location of the <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> gives the same calculation results as those of the method that uses the telegrapher's equations, a comparison of calculation results of two methods has been made.

Location of one of the <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> above the grounding wire significantly reduces the calculated GPR.

25|$|The {{principle}} of silver/silver chloride sensors operation is {{the conversion of}} ion current at the surface of human tissues to electron current to be delivered through the <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> to the instrument to read. An {{important part of the}} operation is electrolyte gel which is applied between the electrode and tissues. The gel contains free chloride ions such that the charge can be carried through the electrolyte, therefore the electrolyte can be considered as conductive for ion current as the human tissues. When the ion current exists, the silver atoms in the electrode oxidize and discharge cations to the electrolyte and the electrons carry charge through the <b>lead</b> <b>wire.</b> At the same time, the chloride ions which are anions in the electrolyte travel toward the electrode and they are reduced as they bond with silver of the electrode resulting in silver chloride and free electrons to deliver to the <b>lead</b> <b>wire.</b> The reaction allows current to pass from electrolyte to electrode and the electron current passes through the <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> for the instrument to read.|$|R

50|$|Smaller {{spark gaps}} {{are often used}} to protect {{sensitive}} electrical or electronic equipment from high-voltage surges. In sophisticated versions of these devices (called gas tube arresters), a small spark gap breaks down during an abnormal voltage surge, safely shunting the surge to ground and thereby protecting the equipment. These devices are commonly used for telephone lines as they enter a building; the spark gaps help protect the building and internal telephone circuits {{from the effects of}} lightning strikes. Less sophisticated (and much less expensive) spark gaps are made using modified ceramic capacitors; in these devices, the spark gap is simply an air gap sawn between the two <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> that connect the capacitor to the circuit. A voltage surge causes a spark that jumps from <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> to <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> across the gap left by the sawing process.

50|$|A thermosonic bond {{falls in}} the {{category}} of a solid state metallic bond which is formed by mating two metal surfaces well below their respective melting points. Coucoulas introduced Thermosonic bonding which significantly improved upon the bond-reliability produced by available commercial solid-state bonding machines where he pre-heated the <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> (and/or metallized silicon chip) prior to introducing the ultrasonic energy cycle. In addition to thermal softening the <b>lead</b> <b>wire,</b> the subsequent delivery of ultrasonic energy produced further softening by interacting at the atomic lattice level of the heated wire (known as ultrasonic softening). These two independent softening mechanisms (pre-heating <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> and deliverying the ultrasonic energy at the atomic lattice level) eliminated the incidences of cracking the fragile and costly silicon chip which were observed by Coucoulas when using earlier commercially available solid-state bonding machines. The improvement occurs because pre-heating and ultrasonic softening the lead-wire dramatically facilitated its deformation in forming the required contact area while using a relatively low set of bonding parameters. Depending on the temperature level and material properties of the <b>lead</b> <b>wire,</b> the onset of recrystallization (metallurgy) or hot working of the deforming wire can occur while it is forming the required contact area. Recrystallization takes place in the strain hardening region of the <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> where it aids in the softening effect. If the wire was ultrasonically deformed at room temperature, it would tend to extensively strain hardened (cold working) and therefore tend to transmit damaging mechanical stresses to the silicon chip. Thermosonic bonding, initially referred to as Hot Work Ultrasonic Bonding by Alexander Coucoulas, was found to bond a wide range of conductive metals such as aluminum and copper wires to tantalum and palladium thin films deposited on aluminum oxide and glass substrates all of which simulated the metallized silicon chip.|$|R
50|$|A Thermosonic bond {{is formed}} using {{a set of}} {{parameters}} which include ultrasonic, thermal and mechanical (force) energies. Figure 1 shows a diagram of a Thermosonic Bonding machine which includes a magnetostrictive or piezoelectric-type transducer {{which is used to}} convert electrical energy into vibratory motion which is known as Piezoelectricity. The vibratory motion travels along the coupler system, a portion which is tapered to serve as the velocity transformer. The velocity transformer amplifies the oscilliatory motion and delivers it to a heated bonding tip. It is akin to a friction bond, since the introduction of ultrasonic energy (via a bonding tool vertically attached to an ultrasonic transformer or horn) simultaneously delivers a force and vibratory or scrubbing motion to the interfacial contact points between a pre-heated deforming lead-wire and the metallized pads of a silicon integrated circuit (Figure 2). In addition to the delivery of thermal energy, the transmission of ultrasonic vibratory energy creates an ultrasonic softening effect by interacting at the atomic lattice level of the preheated <b>lead</b> <b>wire.</b> These two softening effects dramatically facilitates the <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> deformation by forming the desirable contact area using relatively low temperatures and forces. As a result of the frictional action and ultrasonic softening induced in the preheated <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> during the bonding cycle, thermosonic bonding can be used to reliably bond high melting point <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> (such as gold and lower cost aluminum and copper) using relatively low bonding parameters. This ensures that the fragile and costly silicon integrated circuit chip is not exposed to potentially damaging conditions by having to use higher bonding parameters (ultrasonic energy, temperatures or mechanical forces) to deform the <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> in forming the required contact area during the bonding process.|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} {{thin film}} sensor system instrumented on silicon carbide (SiC) fiber reinforced SiC matrix ceramic matrix composites (SiC/SiC CMCs), was evaluated in a Mach 0. 3 burner rig {{in order to}} determine its durability to monitor material/component surface temperature in harsh environments. The sensor system included thermocouples in a thin film form (5 microns thick), fine <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> (75 microns diameter), and the bonds between these wires and the thin films. Other critical components of the overall system were the heavy, swaged <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> cable (500 microns diameter) that contained the fine <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> and was connected to the temperature readout, and ceramic attachments which were bonded onto the CMCs for the purpose of securing the <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> cables, The newly developed ceramic attachment features a combination of hoops made of monolithic SiC or SiC/SiC CMC (which are joined to the test article) and high temperature ceramic cement. Two instrumented CMC panels were tested in a burner rig for a total of 40 cycles to 1150 C (2100 F). A cycle consisted of rapid heating to 1150 C (2100 F), a 5 minute hold at 1150 C (2100 F), and then cooling down to room temperature in 2 minutes. The thin film sensor systems provided repeatable temperature measurements for a maximum of 25 thermal cycles. Two of the monolithic SiC hoops debonded during the sensor fabrication process and two of the SiC/SiC CMC hoops failed during testing. The hoops filled with ceramic cement, however, showed no sign of detachment after 40 thermal cycle test. The primary failure mechanism of this sensor system was the loss of the fine lead wire-to-thin film connection, which either due to detachment of the fine <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> from the thin film thermocouples or breakage of the fine wire...|$|R

30|$|Long <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> {{had to be}} {{used from}} the {{location}} of the strain gauge to the data acquisition system. For example for the top mast gauges, the <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> were about 14  m long. For this reason, a three-wire circuit as opposed to using two wires was adopted. The benefits of the three-wire circuit include intrinsic bridge balance, automatic compensation for the effects of <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> temperature changes on the bridge balance and increased measurement sensitivity compared to the two-wire configuration. The three-wire configuration is the recommended configuration for quarter-bridge strain gauge circuits for static strain measurement [34, 35, 36]. Foil-shielded cable was used to protect the integrity of the gauges’ signal from electrostatic discharge and radio frequency noise. This was highly important since the tower acts as a large antenna which can pick up unwanted noise. The earth wire of each cable was connected to an earth terminal. For the upper gauges, 12 -core multi-stranded wire was used and 8 -core data cable was used for the gauges at ground level. In both cases, the wires’ outer PVC sheath was specified to be UV protected.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the intra- and interobserver variation in delineation {{of the target}} volume of breast tumors on computed tomography (CT) scans in order to perform conformal radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical target volume (CTV) of the breast was delineated in CT slices by four radiation oncologists on our clinically used delineation system. The palpable glandular breast tissue was marked with a <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> on 6 patients before CT scanning, whereas 4 patients were scanned without a <b>lead</b> <b>wire.</b> The CTV was drawn by each observer on three separate occasions. Planning target volumes (PTVs) were constructed by expanding the CTV by 7 mm in each direction, except toward the skin. The deviation in the PTV extent from the average extent was quantified in each orthogonal direction for each patient to find a possible directional dependence in the observer variations. In addition, the standard deviation of the intra- and interobserver variation in the PTV volume was quantified. For each patient, the common volumes delineated by all observers and the smallest volume encompassing all PTVs were also calculated. RESULTS: The patient-averaged deviations in PTV extent were larger in the posterior (42 mm), cranial (28 mm), and medial (24 mm) directions than in the anterior (6 mm), caudal (15 mm), and lateral (8 mm) directions. The mean intraobserver variation in volume percentage (5. 5 %, 1 SD) was {{much smaller than the}} interobserver variation (17. 5 %, 1 SD). The average ratio between the common and encompassing volume for the four observers separately was 0. 82, 0. 74, 0. 82, and 0. 80. A much lower combined average ratio of 0. 43 was found because of the large interobserver variations. For the observer who placed the <b>lead</b> <b>wire,</b> the intraobserver variation in volume was decreased by a factor of 4 on scans made with a <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> in comparison to scans made without a <b>lead</b> <b>wire.</b> For the other observers, no improvement was seen. Based on these results, an improved delineation protocol was designed. CONCLUSIONS: Intra- and especially interobserver variation in the delineation of breast target volume on CT scans can be rather large. A detailed delineation protocol making use of CT scans with <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> placed on the skin around the palpable breast by the delineating observer reduces the intraobserver variation. To reduce the interobserver variation, better imaging techniques and pathology studies relating glandular breast tissue to imaging may be needed to provide more information on the extent of the clinical target volum...|$|R
