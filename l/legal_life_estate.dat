40|$|For {{those who}} want to leave {{farmland}} or a personal residence to a charitable organization, with an income tax or federal estate tax deduction 1 but set it up such that the income goes to the surviving spouse, it’s been possible to use a very simple procedure – a life estate to the surviving spouse and a remainder interest to the charity. 2 The alternative, if a charitable deduction is desired, as is nearly always the case, is to set up a charitable remainder annuity trust, charitable remainder unitrust or a pooled income fund. 3 The simplicity of a <b>legal</b> <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> to the surviving spouse with a remainder interest to the charity has been an appealing choice for many and still assures favorable tax treatment...|$|E

A major concern is what is the income tax basis for a remainder and what happens if the holder of the <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> predeceases the remainder interest holder? Is the holder of the remainder interest entitled to receive a new income tax basis at death...|$|R
50|$|A <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> pur autre vie {{is held by}} {{one person}} for the natural life of another person. Such an estate may arise if the {{original}} life tenant sells her <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> to another, or if the <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> is originally granted pur autre vie.|$|R

However, the rule against perpetuities would void the interest to T's great-grandchildren, and leave the will creating the successive <b>life</b> <b>estates</b> with a reversionary interest in T's estate.|$|R

50|$|A marital <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> is, in {{the common}} law {{tradition}} of the United States and Great Britain, a <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> held by the spouse (husband or wife) or widowed spouse, {{for the duration of}} that spouse's life.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> is {{an estate}} to last someone's {{lifetime}}, either the grantee's lifetime or {{the lifetime of}} someone else - a <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> pur autre vie. These estates {{were used in the}} creation of a strict settlement.|$|R
50|$|Many jurisdictions {{retain the}} {{possibility}} of creating a <b>life</b> <b>estate,</b> although this is uncommon. In the United States, <b>life</b> <b>estates</b> are most commonly used either to grant someone use of the property {{for the remainder of}} that person's life in a will, or by a grantor to reserve the right to continue using the property {{for the remainder of the}} grantor's life after it is sold. The right to ownership of the property after the death of the <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> owner is called the remainder estate. In England and Wales fee simple is the only freehold estate that remains; a <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> can only be created in equity and is not a right in property.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> pur autre vie (Law French, [...] "for {{the life}} of another") is held {{for the rest of}} the {{lifetime}} of a person who does not hold the estate. This form of <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> arises where a life tenant has disposed of the property, assuming such a disposal does not trigger any special forfeiture under the life interest instrument. It also arises where the grantor chooses to make the measuring life that of someone other than the life tenant's <b>life.</b> A <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> pur autre vie is most commonly created in one of two circumstances.|$|R

5000|$|Reversions are {{commonly}} created in real property transactions, particularly during lease arrangements {{as well as}} devise (the transfer of real property through a will). In {{the context of a}} will, a testator may devise a simple <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> to a devisee. The testator may retain the reversion in the estate or give it to another individual. The owner of the <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> will retain ownership of the property during the devisee's life, and may freely alienate this interest. However, upon the death of the devisee the <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> will terminate and ownership of the real-property will fully vest in the holder of the reversion.|$|R
5000|$|A {{land owner}} of an estate cannot give a [...] "greater interest" [...] in the estate than he or she owns. That is, a <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> owner cannot give {{complete}} and indefinite ownership (fee simple) to another person because the life tenant's ownership in the property ends when {{the person who is}} the measuring life dies. For instance, if Ashley conveyed to Bob for the life of Bob, and Bob conveys a <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> to another person, Charlie, for Charlie's <b>life</b> embedded <b>life</b> <b>estate,</b> then Charlie's <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> interest would last only until Charlie or Bob dies. Charlie's life interest or pur autre vie interest (interest for the life of another, whichever has applied) and most often the remaining rights of ownership in the property (the 'reversionary interest') devolve to the persons {{under the terms of the}} will/rules of intestacy/declaration of trust/trust deed (UK) or will/rules of intestacy/'grant or deed of life interest' (or similar) (U.S.) in remainder or revert to the original grantee, depending on terms of Ashley. Such a <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> in the U.S. can also be conveyed for the life of the grantor, such as [...] "A conveys X to B until A dies" [...] and in the UK by trust transferring upon trust or assigning rather than conveying X.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, a <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> is {{typically}} {{used as a}} tool of an <b>estate</b> planning. A <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> can avoid probate and ensure that an intended heir will receive title to real property. For example, Al owns a home and desires that Bill inherit it after Al's death. Al can effectuate that desire by transferring title to the home to Bill and retaining a <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> in the home. Al keeps a <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> and Bill receives a vested fee simple remainder. As soon as Al dies, the <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> interest merges with Bill's remainder, and Bill has a fee simple title. Such a transfer risks the small risk of a fraud on the part of beneficiary Bill if he could easily show in a particular jurisdiction an unfettered fee simple, selling the estate prematurely to an innocent purchaser such as when Al is on vacation but makes the use of a will unnecessary and eliminates the need to probate the asset. A second disadvantage to the grantor is that provision for any remainderman (or men) (party C) is irrevocable without the remainderman's consent. [...] "Beneficiary deeds" [...] have been statutorily created in some states to address this issue.|$|R

50|$|Remainder: A {{remainder}} {{arises when}} a tenant with a fee simple grants someone a <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> or conditional fee simple, and specifies {{a third party}} to whom the land goes when the <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> ends or the condition occurs.

5000|$|In {{common law}} and {{statutory}} law, a <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> is {{the ownership of}} land {{for the duration of}} a person's <b>life.</b> In <b>legal</b> terms it is an estate in real property that ends at death when ownership of the property may revert to the original owner, or it may pass to another person.

40|$|Recent {{reviews of}} two fact situations, {{hundreds}} of miles apart and both the products of planning a half century or more ago, illustrate the hazards of using a deceptively simple estate plan – basing the plan on successive <b>life</b> <b>estates.</b> 1 The strategy often involves unexpected federal estate tax consequences, 2 federal gift tax problems, 3 income tax basis complications 4 and assorted problems relating to like-kind exchanges, involuntary conversions and easements, to mention {{just a few of}} the more likely events occurring during the term of the <b>life</b> <b>estates.</b> Although often viewed as more complex (and costly to set up), a carefully drafted trust generally provides a more satisfactory platform for intergenerational transfers than successive <b>life</b> <b>estates...</b>|$|R

5000|$|A {{reversion}} {{in property}} {{law is a}} future interest that is retained by the grantor after the conveyance of an estate of a lesser quantum that he has (such {{as the owner of}} a fee simple granting a <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> or a leasehold estate). Once the lesser estate comes to an end (the lease expires or the <b>life</b> <b>estate</b> tenant dies), the property automatically reverts (hence reversion) back to the grantor.|$|R
