40|$|In {{designing}} a laser cavity, the <b>laser</b> <b>engineer</b> is frequently concerned {{with more than}} {{the stability of the}} resonator. Other considerations include the size of the beam at various optical surfaces within the resonator or the performance of intracavity line-narrowing or other optical elements. Laser resonators obey the laws of Gaussian beam propagation, not geometric optics. The Gaussian Beam Laser Resonator Program models laser resonators using Gaussian ray trace techniques. It can be used to determine the propagation of radiation through laser resonators. The algorithm used in the Gaussian Beam Resonator program has three major components. First, the ray transfer matrix for the laser resonator must be calculated. Next calculations of the initial beam parameters, specifically, the beam stability, the beam waist size and location for the resonator input element, and the wavefront curvature and beam radius at the input surface to the first resonator element are performed. Finally the propagation of the beam through the optical elements is computed. The optical elements can be modeled as parallel plates, lenses, mirrors, dummy surfaces, or Gradient Index (GRIN) lenses. A Gradient Index lens is a good approximation of a laser rod operating under a thermal load. The optical system may contain up to 50 elements. In addition to the internal beam elements the optical system may contain elements external to the resonator. The Gaussian Beam Resonator program was written in Microsoft FORTRAN (Version 4. 01). It was developed for the IBM PS/ 2 80 - 071 microcomputer and has been implemented on an IBM PC compatible under MS DOS 3. 21. The program was developed in 1988 and requires approximately 95 K bytes to operate...|$|E

40|$|Bacteria {{attachment}} to a surface is {{initiated by the}} adsorption of molecules to form a conditioning film (protein layer) {{on the surface of}} a substratum. The nature of the substratum strongly influences the composition of the adsorbed protein layer which, in turn, affects the interaction of bacterial cells. Fundamental interactions between proteins adsorbed from bacterial growth media (no-cell adhesion) and CO 2 <b>laser</b> surface <b>engineered</b> polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The influence of interfacial wetting on the initial film conditioning of the CO 2 <b>laser</b> surface <b>engineered</b> PET was analysed using contact angle measurements, elucidating the relationship between surface roughness parameters, wettability characteristics and conditioning film formation. Chemical analysis of the CO 2 <b>laser</b> surface <b>engineered</b> PET surfaces revealed that the recorded changes to the surface energy and wettability were the result of surface morphology changes rather than modification of the chemical structure.
