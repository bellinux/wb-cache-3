5|$|<b>Lexical</b> {{variation}} between BASL {{and other}} dialects of ASL was first {{noted in the}} Dictionary of American Sign Language. In a later study of 34 <b>lexical</b> signs, Black signers {{were found to have}} 28 signs that White signers did not know. Older signers are more likely to use variant signs than younger signers. Most of these signs, having been developed in segregated schools for the Black Deaf, refer to everyday life. Younger signers of BASL are less likely to use these variants, but when asked about them are aware that older signers have and use these innovative signs.|$|E
5|$|On May 18, 2013, Perl 5.18 was released. Notable new {{features}} include the new dtrace hooks, <b>lexical</b> subs, more CORE:: subs, {{overhaul of the}} hash for security reasons, support for Unicode 6.2.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lexical</b> {{differences}} between dialects are often considerable. This {{is due to}} the earlier cultural practice of imposing taboo on words which had served as names for a deceased person. Since people were often named after everyday objects, many of these have changed their name several times because of taboo rules, causing dialectal vocabulary to diverge further.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lexical</b> items contain {{information}} about category (<b>lexical</b> and syntactic), form and meaning. The semantics {{related to these}} categories then relate to each <b>lexical</b> item in the lexicon. <b>Lexical</b> items can also be semantically classified based on whether their meanings are derived from single <b>lexical</b> units or from their surrounding environment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lexical</b> {{semantics}} (also {{known as}} lexicosemantics), is a subfield of linguistic semantics. The {{units of analysis}} in <b>lexical</b> semantics are <b>lexical</b> units which include not only words but also sub-words or sub-units such as affixes and even compound words and phrases. <b>Lexical</b> units make up the catalogue of words in a language, the lexicon. <b>Lexical</b> semantics looks at how {{the meaning of the}} <b>lexical</b> units correlates with the structure of the language or syntax. This is referred to as syntax-semantic interface.|$|E
25|$|A <b>lexical</b> entry {{lists the}} basic {{properties}} {{of either the}} whole word, or the individual properties of the morphemes {{that make up the}} word itself. The properties of <b>lexical</b> items include their category selection c-selection, selectional properties s-selection, (also known as semantic selection), phonological properties, and features. The properties of <b>lexical</b> items are idiosyncratic, unpredictable, and contain specific information about the <b>lexical</b> items that they describe.|$|E
25|$|Once bilinguals {{acquire the}} <b>lexical</b> {{information}} from both languages, the bilingual <b>lexical</b> access will be activated in language comprehension. The <b>lexical</b> access in comprehension {{is the process}} how people make contact with <b>lexical</b> representation in their mental lexicon that contains the information, which enables them to understand the words or sentences. Word recognition would be no doubt the most essential process of bilingual <b>lexical</b> access in language comprehension, in which researchers investigate the selective or non-selective recognition of isolated words. At the same time, sentence processing also {{plays an important role}} in language comprehension, in which researchers can investigate whether the presentation of words in a sentence context would restrict <b>lexical</b> access to the target language only.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lexical</b> {{semantics}} also explores {{whether the}} meaning of a <b>lexical</b> unit is established by looking at its neighbourhood in the semantic net, (words it occurs with in natural sentences), or whether the meaning is already locally contained in the <b>lexical</b> unit.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lexical</b> items {{participate}} in regular patterns of association with each other. Some relations between <b>lexical</b> items include hyponymy, hypernymy, synonymy and antonymy, {{as well as}} homonymy.|$|E
25|$|Most current {{studies of}} bilingual <b>lexical</b> access {{are based on}} the {{comprehension}} of isolated words without considering whether contextual information affects <b>lexical</b> access in bilinguals. However, in everyday communication, words are most often encountered in a meaningful context and not in isolation (e.g. in a newspaper article). Research done by DÃ©prez (1994) has shown that mixed utterances in children are not limited to the <b>lexical</b> level but also in the areas of morphology, syntax, and pronunciation. Researchers also began to investigate the cognitive nature of bilingual <b>lexical</b> access in context by examining word recognition in sentences.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} if Hadza has <b>lexical</b> tone. It may have a pitch accent system, but the details have not been worked out. There are no known <b>lexical</b> minimal pairs for stress/tone, though the suffix for the {{habitual}} mood is tonic.|$|E

25|$|Despite its {{relative}} <b>lexical</b> unity, the two dialectal blocks of Catalan (Eastern and Western) show some differences in word choices. Any <b>lexical</b> divergence within {{any of the}} two groups can be explained as an archaism. Also, usually Central Catalan acts as an innovative element.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>lexical</b> accounts, the causative {{alternation}} {{takes place}} {{at the level of the}} <b>lexical</b> conceptual structure (LCS), while in the syntactic accounts, the alternation happens at the level of the syntax, as a result of the interaction between the syntactic structure and the basic verbal element.|$|E
25|$|Starting from a {{sequence}} of characters, the <b>lexical</b> analyzer builds {{a sequence}} of language tokens (such as reserved words, literals, and identifiers) from which the parser builds a syntax tree. The <b>lexical</b> analyzer and the parser handle the regular and context-free parts of the programming language's grammar.|$|E
25|$|The {{impetus to}} {{incorporate}} <b>lexical</b> scoping, {{which was an}} unusual scoping model in the early 1970s, into their new version of Lisp, came from Sussman's studies of ALGOL. He suggested that ALGOL-like <b>lexical</b> scoping mechanisms would help to realize their initial goal of implementing Hewitt's Actor model in Lisp.|$|E
25|$|The Lisp family splits {{over the}} use of dynamic or static (a.k.a. <b>lexical)</b> scope. Clojure, Common Lisp and Scheme make use of static scoping by default, while newLISP, Picolisp and the {{embedded}} languages in Emacs and AutoCAD use dynamic scoping. Since version 24.1, Emacs uses both dynamic and <b>lexical</b> scoping.|$|E
25|$|Lexicalist theory: sees destroy and {{destruction}} as having idiosyncratic <b>lexical</b> entries {{based on their}} differences in morphology. Argues that each morpheme contributes specific meaning. States that {{the formation of the}} complex word destruction is accounted for by a set of <b>Lexical</b> Rules, which are different and independent from syntactic rules.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} area in {{semantic}} analysis is {{the identification of}} the intended meaning at the word level (taken to include idiomatic expressions). This is word-sense disambiguation (a concept that is evolving away from the notion that words have discrete senses, but rather are characterized by {{the ways in which they}} are used, i.e., their contexts). The tasks in this area include <b>lexical</b> sample and all-word disambiguation, multi- and cross-lingual disambiguation, and <b>lexical</b> substitution. Given the difficulties of identifying word senses, other tasks relevant to this topic include word-sense induction, subcategorization acquisition, and evaluation of <b>lexical</b> resources.|$|E

25|$|Dravidian {{languages}} show extensive <b>lexical</b> (vocabulary) borrowing, {{but only}} a few traits of structural (either phonological or grammatical) borrowing from Indo-Aryan, whereas Indo-Aryan shows more structural than <b>lexical</b> borrowings from the Dravidian languages. Many of these features are already present in the oldest known Indo-Aryan language, the language of the Rigveda (c.1500 BCE), which also includes over a dozen words borrowed from Dravidian.|$|E
25|$|They {{argue that}} a predicate's {{argument}} structure is represented in the syntax, and that the syntactic representation of the predicate is a <b>lexical</b> projection of its arguments. Thus, {{the structure of a}} predicate is strictly a <b>lexical</b> representation, where each phrasal head projects its argument onto a phrasal level within the syntax tree. The selection of this phrasal head is based on Chomsky's Empty Category Principle. This <b>lexical</b> projection of the predicate's argument onto the syntactic structure is the foundation for the Argument Structure Hypothesis. This idea coincides with Chomsky's Projection Principle, because it forces a VP to be selected locally and be selected by a Tense Phrase (TP).|$|E
25|$|As of 7 June 2010, the twenty-million word {{database}} contained 4,056 Hebrew roots. Of its 54,807 entries, 14,592 are nouns, adjectives and adverbs, and 13,979 are verbs. The balance {{consists of}} personal names, numbers, prepositions and similar <b>lexical</b> items. The {{size of the}} database on that date was about 40 gigabytes.

25|$|Somali's main <b>lexical</b> {{borrowings}} {{come from}} Arabic. Soravia (1994) noted {{a total of}} 1,436 Arabic loanwords in Agostini a.o. 1985, a prominent Somali dictionary. Most of the vocabulary terms consisted of commonly used nouns. These <b>lexical</b> borrowings {{may have been more}} extensive in the past since a few words that Zaborski (1967:122) observed in the older literature were absent in Agostini's later work.|$|E

25|$|The general {{consensus}} {{in the field is}} that there is a derivational relationship between verbs undergoing the causative alternation that share the same <b>lexical</b> entry. From this it follows that there is uncertainty surrounding which form, the intransitive or the intransitive, is the base from which the other is derived. Another matter of debate is whether the derivation takes place at the syntactic or <b>lexical</b> level.|$|E

25|$|Based on the {{interaction}} between <b>lexical</b> properties, locality, and {{the properties of the}} EPP (where a phrasal head selects another phrasal element locally), Hale and Keyser make the claim that the Specifier position or a complement are the only two semantic relations that project a predicate's argument. In 2003, Hale and Keyser put forward this hypothesis and argued that a <b>lexical</b> unit must have one or the other, Specifier or Complement, but cannot have both.|$|E
25|$|Spreading activation, {{a process}} where similar {{concepts}} are activated when their neighbors are activated, {{is a widely}} accepted model of <b>lexical</b> access. It {{has been shown in}} both bilingual and monolingual individuals, with bilinguals showing activation in both languages during language research tasks. Multiple studies have shown that bilinguals recognize cognate words more quickly than non-cognate words, especially identical cognates, which produce the strongest effect. These effects occurred even when the participants knew ahead of time what language the target words would be in. Despite the specific language contexts, both languages are activated, showing that <b>lexical</b> access is not language-specific and that top-down processing is important in <b>lexical</b> access. Findings suggest that the amount of activation that occurred cross-linguistically was related to the similarity between the translation equivalents of the languages.|$|E
