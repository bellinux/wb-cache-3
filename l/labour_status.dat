40|$|By {{attracting}} the {{attention on the}} possibility of an inverse relationship between wages and unemployment, the model recently developed by Blanchflower and Oswald seems to provide an interesting explanation of the efficiency wage. Although this analysis is especially appropriated to the context of the industrialised countries, the opportunity of a such approach seems to prevail equally in developing countries. Indeed, {{with the help of the}} national household survey of Burkina Faso, realised in 1994 _ 95, the present research shows that, all other things being equal, a doubling of the rate of unemployment implies a 25, 8 per cent reduction in real wages. Furthermore, it appears that the rigidity of wages is far more strong for protected wage_earners that to these that have a non protected <b>labour</b> <b>status.</b> Since labour is an important asset whose shortage weakens the capacity of resistance of individuals or social groups to changes of the environment, the risk of insecurity in terms of well_being is considerably increased for individuals having a precarious <b>labour</b> <b>status</b> and for households whose chief is a non protected employee.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Social {{factors have}} been proved to be main {{determinants}} of individuals’ health. Recent studies have also analyzed the contribution {{of some of those}} factors, such as education and job status, to socioeconomic inequalities in health. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide new evidence about the factors driving socioeconomic inequalities in health for the Spanish population by including housing deprivation and social interactions as health determinants. Methods Cross-sectional study based on the Spanish sample of European Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) for 2006. The concentration index measuring income-related inequality in health is decomposed into the contribution of each determinant. Several models are estimated to test the influence of different regressors for three proxies of ill-health. Results Health inequality favouring the better-off is observed in the distribution of self-assessed health, presence of chronic diseases and presence of limiting conditions. Inequality is mainly explained, besides age, by social factors such as <b>labour</b> <b>status</b> and financial deprivation. Housing deprivation contributes to pro-rich inequality in a percentage ranging from 7. 17 % to 13. 85 %, and social interactions from 6. 16 % to 10. 19 %. The contribution of some groups of determinants significantly differs depending on the ill-health variable used. Conclusions Health inequalities can be mostly reduced or shaped by policy, as they are mainly explained by social determinants such as <b>labour</b> <b>status,</b> education and other socioeconomic conditions. The major role played on health inequality by variables taking part in social exclusion points to the need to focus on the most vulnerable groups. JEL Codes H 51, I 14, I 18 </p...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a social}} history of indigent transiency, written using the records of criminal justice systems and poor relief infrastructure {{in order to examine}} the lives, experiences, and socio-political significance of vagrants and pauper migrants in the Mid-Atlantic between 1816 and 1850. It examines the causes for and consequences of illicit mobilities in this period, and argues that the policing of vagrancy and pauper mobility demonstrate key interpretations {{of the role of the}} state in defining and regulating class. It is the first study to link conceptually indigent transiency with the policing of vagrancy, limitations on the movement of African Americans, forced transportation of the wandering poor, and management of the spread of disease in this period. This study follows the vagrants and pauper migrants whose geographical movements were at odds with settlement laws, state constitutions, and welfare policies. It charts how the itinerant poor were forcibly transported to places deemed by the state to be their legal settlement through the process of pauper removal long after most historians acknowledge removal to have ended. It also considers the ways in which fugitive slaves and runaway servants experienced a transition from the oppression of an unfree <b>labour</b> <b>status</b> to the oppression of poverty after participating in illicit forms of mobility. This dissertation advances one central argument: that indigent transiency, in its many shapes and through the varied forms of its management, contributed significantly to contemporary understandings of citizenship, community, <b>labour</b> <b>status,</b> freedom of movement, the spread of disease, and the transformation of punishment in the early American republic. It proposes that indigent transiency was among the most important factors in determining how the poor lived, interacted with, and were viewed by local and state governments and their representatives, both under the law and by law enforcement, in this period...|$|E

We assume that young people may fall in five labour market statuses: 1) Employee; 2) Self-employed; 3) Unemployed; 4) In Education; 5) Inactive, and perform a multinomial logit model to {{study the effects of}} years of education on relative probability of being in <b>labour</b> <b>statuses</b> 2, 3, 4, or 5, compared to the base category (Employee). Afterwards, we interact the individual-level years of education with a country-level indicator of education mismatch in order to identify the heterogeneous effects of the aggregate mismatch among people with different educational attainments. Results show that more years of education: i) reduce the relative probability of being unemployed; ii) have a cumulative effect by extending the period of education; iii) slightly raise the relative probability to be self-employed. As regards country-level education mismatch, we found that only after 2008 it produces an additional effect on better educated young people by further reducing their relative unemployment risk when it is compared to that of low educated youngsters. This outcome tells us that improving access to university degrees remains the main road to tackle youth unemployment caused by education mismatch, even after the outburst of the current financial and economic crisis...|$|R

For most users, the internet is a tool that facilitates communication and information flow.

Locally, estimates of Problematic Internet Use (PIU) amongst the Maltese population or a sub-section of the general population remain unknown. Therefore, this research is a first attempt to explore the prevalence of PIU and related socio-demographic variables among a representative sample of young people in Malta aged between 18 - 30 years. The study has three particular aims: 1. to assess the prevalence of PIU amongst young Maltese people; 2. to explore the relationship between PIU and a number of socio-demographic variables, namely age, gender, district of residence, educational status successfully completed, <b>labour</b> <b>status,</b> type of occupation and relationship/marital status; 3. to contribute to international empirical research in the last decade and provide data that can be used to further understand the phenomenon of PIU and its related variables. To date, the classification of Internet Addiction is still contentious and no gold standard of assessment formally exists. Young’s Internet Addiction Test (IAT) was used to measure PIU amongst the sample. The final questionnaire package consisted of the following: • One open question asking participants what they use the Internet most for. • The 20 IAT Likert-scale questions. • An additional 8 close-ended questions related to socio-demographic variables: age, gender, locality, educational level successfully achieved, <b>labour</b> <b>status,</b> job title, relationship status and household composition.
