Radial basis function (RBF) and three-layer perceptron (TLP) {{are the most}} widely adopted ANN architectures. In wireless transmitter behavioral modeling literature, it is reported the effective use of either TLP or RBF. The contribution of this work is to present a comparative study between TLP and RBF in terms of computational complexity and modeling accuracy. In here, the basic requirements that the ANN-based models must comply with to properly model the behavior of bandpass systems is first identified. Then, both TLP and RBF are applied to the <b>low-pass</b> <b>equivalent</b> behavioral modeling of three different wireles...|$|E

A nonsingular terminal sliding-mode manifold is designed for the observer and the related control strategies are applied to stabilize the whole motor system. The designed high-order sliding-mode control laws guarantee the strong robustness of the motor system and generate a smooth control signal which can be directly used for the estimation. The effect of the <b>equivalent</b> <b>low-pass</b> filter in the high-order sliding-mode mechanism can be regulated based on the performance requirements. In addition, the chattering phenomenon in the sliding-mode control based motor system can be eliminated effectively. The simulation results validate the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proves that}} the {{traditional}} way of deriving power amplifier <b>low-pass</b> <b>equivalent</b> complex-signal Volterra models from their original band-pass RF real-signal Volterra models is too restrictive, and so {{does not lead to}} an optimal model. Then, it proposes a much richer alternative approach. Instead of deriving the base-band Volterra model from the RF Volterra model, we started by a general Volterra series expansion of a complex-signal to only then impose the restrictions of odd parity required by the <b>low-pass</b> <b>equivalent</b> polynomial approximation. This way, not only we prove that the theoretical reticence that was raised to similar approaches previously proposed for the memoryless polynomial and the memory polynomial were unfounded, as experimental results fully justified this novel approac...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{terminal}} sliding-mode (TSM) observer for estimating the immeasurable mechanical parameters of permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) used for complex mechanical systems. The observer can track the system states in finite-time with high steady-state precision. A TSM control strategy {{is designed to}} guarantee the global finite-time stability of the observer, and meanwhile to estimate the mechanical parameters of the PMSM. A novel second-order sliding-mode algorithm is designed to soften the switching control signal of the observer. The effect of the <b>equivalent</b> <b>low-pass</b> filter can be properly controlled in the algorithm based on requirements. The smooth signal of the TSM observer is directly used for the parameter estimation.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a design methodology of a third-order three-element patch array {{that has no}} filtering parts and yet behaves like a filtering antenna (filtenna). The design approach includes shaping the frequency response of the reflection coefficient and modeling the frequency response of the normalized realized gain. In order to control the shape of these two responses, gi coefficients of an <b>equivalent</b> <b>low-pass</b> prototype filter are derived for designing the third-order filtering antenna array. The design methodology was verified over the frequency band from 4. 8 to 6. 8 GHz for levels of the reflection coefficient from - 10 to - 20 dB and for fractional bandwidths from 7 % to 14 %. The whole design methodology was supported by manufacturing and measuring three third-order filtering antenna arrays designed with different configurations. The simulated and measured results show good agreement in all cases...|$|R
40|$|Pilot-based {{calibration}} {{techniques are}} used to reduce the effects of multipath fading in mobile satellite receivers. One of the more recent of these techniques, namely the tone calibration technique (TCT), suggests transmitting double sideband modulation with the pilot tone located {{at the center of}} its spectrum where the amplitude and phase characteristics of the channel are most stable. To 'make room' for the pilot {{in the presence of the}} Doppler shift, the <b>equivalent</b> <b>low-pass</b> data sidebands must be shaped so as to have zero response in the neighborhood of dc. Other techniques such as transparent tone-in-band (TTIB) similarly 'notch out' a hole in the center of the data spectrum for location of the pilot. An alternate possibility which is at the same time much more bandwidth efficient than TCT is a dual-pilot tone calibration technique (DPTCT) that symmetrically locates a pair of pilots outside the data spectrum near the band edges of the channel. The operation and performance of DPTCT are analyzed, and its effectiveness is compared to that of the single tone TCT technique...|$|R

40|$|An optimal {{frequency}} domain textural edge detection filter is developed and its performance evaluated. For the given model and filter bandwidth, the filter maximizes {{the amount of}} output image energy placed within a specified resolution interval centered on the textural edge. Filter derivation is based on relating textural edge detection to tonal edge detection via the complex <b>low-pass</b> <b>equivalent</b> representation of narrowband bandpass signals and systems. The filter is specified {{in terms of the}} prolate spheroidal wave functions translated in frequency. Performance is evaluated using the asymptotic approximation version of the filter.

30|$|In {{wireless}} communications, the {{bit error}} rate (BER) is an important metric {{which is used to}} gauge and compare the system performance. Since this noise modulated covert communications system is a new architecture, the theoretical BER performance in an additive white Gaussian noise channel is derived and compared with simulation results in this section. Unlike other single-channel spread spectrum systems, the <b>low-pass</b> <b>equivalent</b> model can directly be used to model the system behavior in the Gaussian channel. The spreading and dispreading process of our system is accomplished at the RF front-end. The noise floor at the antenna output {{is not the same as}} that at the output of the first mixer, and the noise terms within the system are generated by mixing of two zero mean independent Gaussian random variables. Thus, the system behavior needs to be modeled based upon the relationship between the SNR at the output of receiver antenna and the probability of bit error. In this section, we will demonstrate that the mixed noise can be approximated as Gaussian after passing through a narrow-band filter, and the BER equation can be expressed using the Q-function. The bandwidths of the signal, antenna, low-pass filter, and the SNR at the output of receiver's antenna are the parameters which dominate the BER when the bit rate is fixed.|$|E
40|$|This report {{represents}} {{the last and}} most important document I have made during my time in the university. The main idea that surrounds all this work is the elaboration of a source code by a student for students. Because of that, the simulation is based in MATLAB and oriented to be as changeable as possible to allow people with a medium knowledge of this program to understand and modify it. The initial step of this project is the simulation of an Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system and its later validation. The system applies the fundamental orthogonality principles of the signals and creates a multiple carrier waveform including a modulated symbol in each carrier. This systems are usually in a certain central frequency with established bandwidth in the frequency spectrum. In this case the situation is a <b>low-pass</b> <b>equivalent</b> simulation only to see the waveform and error results of the modulation/demodulation process. The motivation for this report comes from {{the implementation of the}} 5 G network in mobile communication and the uncertainty of the new OFDM waveform. There are two systems that have real chances to become the new waveform: Zero Tail based OFDM and Filter Bank Multicarrier based OFDM. The 5 G networks are the immediate future for mobile communications and their development has to {{be in the hands of}} the system performance instead of the different companies’ interest. To be impartial developing this new systems requires an academic point of view in favor of the better solution possible for the new mobile networks. The aim of this simulation is to be able to compare this new systems with a working model of the standard OFDM. In this report it was only possible to study and analyze the Zero Tail based OFDM leaving the rest for future projects. However the simulation goal is to be as adaptable as possible, the channel models implemented in the source code are Long Term Evolution (commonly known as 4 G) because of the drive of this new OFDM waveforms. The ideal situation to this experiments would be working with the 5 G channel models (which are not decided yet), but it would be accurate enough to start with the already established ones.
