The lumber samples represent 30 - 80 years old red pine trees harvested from a south west site in Turkey.

40|$|We {{consider}} various hadron {{models with}} a string carrying $n= 3 $ massive points (quarks) : Y configuration, <b>linear</b> baryon <b>model</b> $q$-$q$-$q$ <b>and</b> the closed string. For these models classical rotational states (planar uniform rotations) are tested for stability with respect to small disturbances. It is shown that rotations of all mentioned models are unstable, but nature of this instability is different. For the model Y the instability results from existence of multiple real frequencies in the spectrum of small disturbances, but for the <b>linear</b> <b>model</b> <b>and</b> the closed string the similar spectra contain complex frequencies, corresponding to exponentially growing modes of disturbances.

As most exact results of interest are obtained only for the general linear model, the general linear model has undergone a somewhat longer historical development. Results for the generalized linear model with non-identity link are asymptotic (tending to work well with large samples).|$|E

50|$|In statistics, {{hierarchical}} generalized {{linear models}} (HGLM) extend generalized linear models by relaxing {{the assumption that}} error components are independent. This allows models {{to be built in}} situations where more than one error term is necessary and also allows for dependencies between error terms. The error components can be correlated and not necessarily follow a normal distribution. When there are different clusters, that is, groups of observations, the observations in the same cluster are correlated. In fact, they are positively correlated because observations in the same cluster share some common features. In this situation, using generalized <b>linear</b> <b>models</b> <b>and</b> ignoring the correlations may cause problems.|$|E
5000|$|Indirect {{comparison}} meta-analysis methods (also called network meta-analyses, {{in particular}} when multiple treatments are assessed simultaneously) generally use two main methodologies. First, is the Bucher method {{which is a}} single or repeated comparison of a closed loop of three-treatments such {{that one of them}} is common to the two studies and forms the node where the loop begins and ends. Therefore, multiple two-by-two comparisons (3-treatment loops) are needed to compare multiple treatments. This methodology requires that trials with more than two arms have two arms only selected as independent pair-wise comparisons are required. The alternative methodology uses complex statistical modelling to include the multiple arm trials and comparisons simultaneously between all competing treatments.

The benefits of kSGD, in comparison to other methods, are (1) it is not sensitive to the condition number of the problem , (2) it has a robust choice of hyperparameters, and (3) it has a stopping condition. The drawbacks of kSGD is that the algorithm requires storing a dense covariance matrix between iterations, and requires a matrix-vector product at each iteration.|$|E
