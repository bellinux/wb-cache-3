25|$|Despite the {{existence}} of snake charmers, {{there have also been}} professional snake catchers or wranglers. Modern-day snake trapping involves a herpetologist using a long stick with a V- shaped end.

However, in the playoffs the Nats would lose a 3-game series to Chamberlain and the Warriors.|$|E

Although {{the country as a whole}} has shifted to the left, they aren't {{increasing}} their liberalness at the same rate as Democrats. Democrats <b>like</b> <b>Bill</b> Clinton were considered to be centrists but Obama has run to the left of Clinton on the budget, social issues, welfare reform, entitlement reform, and Israel relations. Obama has focused on income inequality while President Clinton stressed opportunity and mobility. Bill Clinton lowered capital gains taxes while the current president supports raising it.|$|E
25|$|Herman's other bands {{include the}} Third Herd (1950–56) and various later editions during the 1960's. In the 1950s, the Third Herd {{went on a}} {{successful}} European tour. He was known for hiring the best young musicians and using their arrangements. In the early and mid 1960s, Herman gained a wider recognition by fronting {{one of the most}} exciting Herds to date that featured future stellar names like Michael Moore, drummer Jake Hanna, tenor saxophonist Sal Nistico, trombonists Phil Wilson and Henry Southall and trumpeters <b>like</b> <b>Bill</b> Chase, Paul Fontaine and Dusko Goykovitch. By 1968, the Herman library came to be heavily influenced by rock and roll. He was also known to feature brass and woodwind instruments not traditionally associated with jazz, such as the bassoon, oboe or French horn.|$|E
25|$|In 1989–90, {{new talent}} such as Mike Myers, Adam Sandler, and Chris Farley were added. Afraid of cast members leaving for film careers, Michaels had overcrowded the cast, causing a {{divide between the}} veteran members and the new, younger talent, {{increasing}} competition for limited screen time. By 1995, Carvey and Hartman had left, taking with them a virtual army of characters, Myers quit for his movie career, and increasing network pressure forced Michaels to fire Sandler and Farley. The show saw its next major overhaul, bringing in a new cast including Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, and Jimmy Fallon. While cast members would leave over the following two decades, the show saw its next biggest transition in 2013, {{with the addition of}} 6 cast members to compensate for the departure of several longtime cast members <b>like</b> <b>Bill</b> Hader, Jason Sudeikis, and Fred Armisen.|$|E

500|$|In February 2006, author Timothy Sexton {{wrote an}} article titled [...] "Hoodwinked: A Postmodern Examination of the Dangers of Runaway Capitalism" [...] for Associated Content, in which he posited that Hoodwinked! {{was one of the}} first postmodern {{animated}} films and also carried political undertones. He argued that the relative nature of truth was shown by revealing deviations from the original fairy tale as the film explored the story from each of the central characters' points of view. Calling Hoodwinked! [...] "the most subversive movie released nationwide since Fahrenheit 9/11", Sexton went on to interpret the film as a critique on the free enterprise system. He drew comparisons between the film's villain and the typical American business owner, going so far as to say that the character was [...] "clearly based on people <b>like</b> <b>Bill</b> Gates and Sam Walton". In Sexton's view, the film exposed the flaws of capitalism, showing that if left unregulated, business owners will establish monopolies and eliminate competition.|$|E
500|$|Le Mesurier {{was a heavy}} drinker, but {{was never}} noticeably drunk. In 1977 he {{collapsed}} in Australia and flew home, where {{he was diagnosed with}} cirrhosis of the liver and ordered to stop drinking. Until then he had not considered himself an alcoholic, although he accepted that [...] "it was the cumulative effect over the years that had done the damage". It was {{a year and a half}} before he drank alcohol again, when he avoided spirits and drank only beer. Jacques claimed that his calculated vagueness was the result of his dependence on cannabis, although according to Le Mesurier the drug was not to his taste; he smoked it only during his period of abstinence from alcohol. Le Mesurier's favoured pastime was visiting the jazz clubs around Soho, such as The Establishment or Ronnie Scott's, and he observed that [...] "listening to artists <b>like</b> <b>Bill</b> Evans, Oscar Peterson or Alan Clare always made life seem that little bit brighter".|$|E
500|$|Reviewers were {{generally}} {{satisfied with the}} conclusion, and some <b>like</b> <b>Bill</b> Keveney of the USA Today felt the episode does not stray far from [...] "the series formula – a mix of sci-fi adventure, relationships and humor". Jason Van Horn of IGN enjoyed the humor, [...] "the amount of heart and pure emotion running rampant this episode", which he thought served as a symbol for the entire show that will stay {{in the public mind}} through re-runs and DVDs. Two scenes that stood out for him as [...] "powerful", [...] "heart-wrenching" [...] and [...] "the icing on the cake", were Mitchell's breakdown and Vala's seduction of Daniel signaling [...] "the beginning of a very long lasting and loving relationship". Vala's emotional response to Daniel was interpreted as an example of her character growth, while another reviewer felt the [...] "Vala/Daniel argument [...] a tad overwrought [...] the motivation is clear". The emotional death of Landry appealed to several reviewers, as did the resolution via Teal'c's heroic sacrifice.|$|E

His music is said to utilize the [...] "supple funk of his vocals and arid strum of his guitar" [...] while recalling [...] "the low-volume, early-'70s acoustic soul of stars <b>like</b> <b>Bill</b> Withers and Minnie Ripperton". [...] A New York Times music critic described Lee as having a [...] "honeyed singing voice – light amber, mildly sweet, a touch of grain" [...] which he features [...] "squarely, without much fuss or undue strain" [...] in his [...] "1970s folk rock and rustic soul" [...] musical song craft. According to a music writer at ABC News, Lee [...] "has that folksy, bluesy vibe, with a bit of country twang" [...] and a voice that is [...] "ever soulful". Simultaneously Lee has been both lauded and dismissed as the [...] "male Norah Jones" [...] and his lyrics are said to convey [...] "the complexities of everyday emotions" [...] without falling into flowery imagery. Lee's songs have appeared on a number of TV shows including Parenthood.|$|E
500|$|After Robinson's hire as manager, Doby {{returned}} {{to work for the}} Expos. In 1976, Bill Veeck purchased the White Sox for a second time and hired Doby to be the team's batting coach. As a team, the White Sox finished the 1976 season with a [...]255 batting average, 586 runs scored and 73 home runs. By June 29, 1977, the team's average was [...]284, and had recorded 382 runs scored and 87 home runs. They finished the season second in team batting average (to the Yankees and Red Sox, each with a [...]281 average) and had 192 home runs and 844 runs scored as a team. After firing the White Sox's manager and former Doby teammate Bob Lemon, Veeck replaced him with Doby on June 30, 1978. At age 53, Doby became the second black manager in the majors after Robinson. [...] "It's so nice to work for a man <b>like</b> <b>Bill</b> Veeck.

500|$|A genetically {{enhanced}} superhuman {{who used}} {{his strength and}} intellect to briefly rule much of Earth in the 1990s. Montalbán said that he believed all good villains do villainous things, but {{think that they are}} acting for the [...] "right" [...] reasons; in this way, Khan uses his anger at the death of his wife to justify his pursuit of Kirk. The film was close to production approval when it occurred to the producers that no one had asked Montalbán whether he was interested in appearing in the film despite his character having been in the scripts for more than a year. Montalbán was unsure whether he could plausibly play Khan again after many years, especially given his current role of Mr. Roarke on Fantasy Island. Contrary to speculation that Montalbán used a prosthetic chest, no artificial devices were added to emphasize Montalbán's muscular physique, since even in his 60s and despite an increasingly painful back injury, stemming from being thrown off a horse in the 1950s, Montalbán had a vigorous workout routine. Montalbán enjoyed making the film, and counted the role as a career highlight. His major complaint was that he was never face-to-face with Shatner for a scene. [...] "I had to do my lines with the script girl, who, as you might imagine, sounded nothing <b>like</b> <b>Bill</b> ," [...] he explained.|$|E
