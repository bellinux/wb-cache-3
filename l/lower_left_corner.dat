5|$|Overall, {{the relief}} is in {{excellent}} condition. It was originally received in three pieces and some fragments by the British Museum; after repair, some cracks are still apparent, in particular a triangular piece missing {{on the right}} edge, but the main features of the deity and the animals are intact. The figure's face has damage to its left side, {{the left side of}} the nose and the neck region. The headdress has some damage to its front and right hand side, but the overall shape can be inferred from symmetry. Half of the necklace is missing and the symbol of the figure held in her right hand; the owls' beaks are lost and a piece of a lion's tail. A comparison of images from 1936 and 2005 shows that some modern damage has been sustained as well: the right hand side of the crown has now lost its top tier, and at the <b>lower</b> <b>left</b> <b>corner</b> a piece of the mountain patterning has chipped off and the owl has lost its right-side toes. However, in all major aspects, the relief has survived intact for more than 3,500years.|$|E

25|$|Examination of the {{painting}} under ultra-violet has shown {{that almost all of}} the mountain (all except for the <b>lower</b> <b>left</b> <b>corner)</b> has been damaged and repaired, which suggests that this central scene was the most studied and handled part of the scroll, perhaps due to the greater critical value placed on landscape painting over figure painting by Ming and Qing dynasty art connoisseurs.|$|E

25|$|Wittgenstein and Hitler {{were born}} just six days apart, though Hitler had to re-sit his {{mathematics}} exam before being allowed into a higher class, while Wittgenstein was moved forward by one, so {{they ended up}} two grades apart at the Realschule. Monk estimates they were both at the school during the 1904–1905 school year, but {{says there is no}} evidence they {{had anything to do with}} each other. Several commentators have argued that a school photograph of Hitler may show Wittgenstein in the <b>lower</b> <b>left</b> <b>corner,</b> but Hamann says the photograph stems from 1900 or 1901, before Wittgenstein's time.|$|E
25|$|Promotional style {{originally}} {{consisted of}} the BBC One box placed in the <b>lower</b> <b>left</b> <b>corner</b> of the screen throughout the promotion and an end board consisting of a translucent white strip along the bottom containing the box logo. This end board style was recreated for the, less frequently seen, static captions. This style was changed on 1 May 2004 to an orange background that would close shut over {{the end of a}} promotion to contain the programme title. The static slide was also updated, with the space for the programme image reduced to the top quarter of the screen.|$|E
25|$|South side: The Battle of Atlanta depicts Sherman and {{his staff}} {{listening}} to cannon fire at Sherman's headquarters at the Augustus Hurt (Howard) House. Among those present and identifiable are General Oliver O. Howard, General John Schofield, and Colonel Orlando Metcalfe Poe (the Chief of Engineers, who is delivering information to Sherman). In the background, the XVIth Corps is shown repulsing the attack which saved the Army of the Tennessee from defeat. In the <b>lower</b> <b>left</b> <b>corner,</b> an escort is arriving. This escort is intended to symbolize the troop which would take the body of General James B. McPherson {{from the field of}} battle.

25|$|We take an illustrative {{synthetic}} bivariate {{data set}} of 50 points {{to illustrate the}} construction of histograms. This requires the choice of an anchor point (the <b>lower</b> <b>left</b> <b>corner</b> of the histogram grid). For the histogram on the left, we choose (−1.5,−1.5): for {{the one on the}} right, we shift the anchor point by 0.125 in both directions to (−1.625,−1.625). Both histograms have a binwidth of 0.5, so any differences are due to the change in the anchor point only. The colour-coding indicates the number of data points which fall into a bin: 0=white, 1=pale yellow, 2=bright yellow, 3=orange, 4=red. The left histogram appears to indicate that the upper half has a higher density than the lower half, whereas the reverse is the case for the right-hand histogram, confirming that histograms are highly sensitive to the placement of the anchor point.|$|E
25|$|The Torino GT was {{relatively}} unchanged from 1968, {{and continued to}} come standard with a 302-2V engine. The grille received minor updates, including revised divider bars and the GT emblem moved to the <b>lower</b> <b>left</b> <b>corner</b> of the grille. The 'C' stripe was revised, and now ran in straight lines, rather than following the body line like in 1968. All 1969 Torino GT's came equipped a non-functional fibreglass hood scoop that had turn signal indicators {{at the rear of}} the scoop (this was optional on non-Ram Air Cobras). This scoop became functional if the 428-4V with Ram Air induction was specified. The hood scoop could also be deleted from the GT for a credit. Although the Torino GT could be optioned to include all of the Cobra's performance features, the GT was a more upscale vehicle and had the more deluxe Torino trim.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous item found is the Nuzi map, which is the oldest known map ever discovered. It is unknown exactly what the Nuzi map charts, even though the {{majority}} of the tablet is preserved. The Nuzi map is actually one of the so-called Gasur texts, and predates the invasion of the city of Gasur by the Hurrians, who renamed it Nuzi. The cache of economic and business documents among which the map was found date to the Old Akkadian period (ca. 2360-2180 BC). Gasur was a thriving commercial center, and the texts reveal a varied business community with far reaching enterprises. It is possible that Ebla was a trading partner, and that the tablet, rather than a record of land-holdings, might indeed be a road map. The tablet, which is approximately 6 x 6.5cm., is inscribed only on the obverse. It shows the city of Maskan-dur-ebla in the <b>lower</b> <b>left</b> <b>corner,</b> as well and a canal/river and two mountain ranges.|$|E

In 1913, they also applied a Republica overprint to a variety of older stamps going back to 1898.|$|R
