40|$|In {{the context}} of {{distance}} language learning, speaking is frequently perceived as the most challenging skill; this paper reports on a 12 -week summer <b>language</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>programme</b> providing students with new ways of practising their oral abilities. Students who completed an undergraduate beginners’ language module took part in regular online, synchronous language exchange sessions with a partner. This paper analyses the impact of {{taking part in a}} language exchange task on the students’ motivation. The mixed methods research included an activity perception questionnaire (based on Deci, Eghrari, Patrick and Leone, 1994) to investigate the motivation of participants whilst undertaking a specific language exchange session, as well as qualitative data from both the questionnaire and the project discussion forum. The <b>language</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>programme</b> provides the opportunity for learners to take ownership of their learning and personalize it, and functions as a bridge between formal and informal learning. However, despite the enjoyment and interest provided by this type of experience, it is not without stress, and requires self-determination and autonomy to result in a positive and sustainable learning experience. ...|$|E
50|$|The {{predecessor}} organisation of today's Austro-British Society {{was founded}} in 1946. After World War II the Allies, consisting of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, sought to promote the bilateral ties with Austria. They wanted to improve not only their formal relationships but also their relationships aside official diplomacy. Hence, several bilateral organisations were founded - including amongst them, the Austro-British Society. For decades, the Society organised <b>language</b> courses and <b>exchange</b> <b>programmes.</b> By 2005, however, the Society had {{become more and more}} inactive and ultimately dissolved.|$|R

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of globalisation, {{more and more}} Chinese students choose {{to engage in the}} <b>exchange</b> <b>programme</b> for an international vision and education experience. Many researchers have explored benefits and drawbacks of <b>exchange</b> <b>programme</b> for the students, however, there is still a lack of research concerning the value co-creation in <b>exchange</b> <b>programme</b> for Chinese students. Hence, take the <b>exchange</b> <b>programme</b> provided by the University of Nottingham as an example, this research aims to investigate the marketing concept of value co-creation in British higher education sector, especially the value co-creation in <b>exchange</b> <b>programme</b> for Chinese students. In order to achieve the aim of this study, the qualitative in-depth semi-structured interview was applied with documentary data about the <b>exchange</b> <b>programme</b> within the University of Nottingham. The primary data was collected from the total of twenty-one participants, who had studied in the University of Nottingham as an exchange student for at least one semester, and the secondary data was mainly from the official website of University of Nottingham in the International section. Based on the findings, it showed that the Value Co-Creation of <b>Exchange</b> <b>Programme</b> at the University of Nottingham for Chinese students is successful to a large extent, by analysing the documentary data about the programme offered and the Chinese students’ response to the interview. The study gives new perspectives for British education in <b>exchange</b> <b>programme,</b> particularly for Chinese students. It provides British universities with a better understanding when co-create value with the Chinese students. Finally, future additional research area is recommended in the British higher education sector by value co-creation...|$|R

40|$|The {{international}} exchange of students {{plays an important}} role in acquisition of new knowledge and skills. However, it was possible to start implementing such <b>exchange</b> <b>programmes</b> at the Riga Technical University only in 1991 after the reestablishment of the Department of Geodesy.  Currently, the Riga Technical University cooperates with several countries in implementing <b>exchange</b> <b>programmes</b> of students. The main problems encountered in this process are similar: inadequate foreign language skills, a lack of internationally recognized coursebooks and other study materials, insufficient cooperation between the universities that implement <b>exchange</b> <b>programmes.</b> These problems should be addressed by creating a working group and expanding cooperation, as well as enhancing requirements for students who participate in the <b>exchange</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R
40|$|International student <b>exchange</b> <b>programmes</b> are {{acknowledged}} as {{one aspect of}} a broader suite of internationalisation strategies aimed at enhancing students' intercultural understanding and competence. The decision {{to participate in an}} <b>exchange</b> <b>programme</b> is dependent on both individual and contextual factors such as student <b>exchange</b> policies and <b>programmes</b> of the home university. The aim of the current study was to demonstrate the relationship between participation rates in Australian university <b>exchange</b> <b>programmes</b> and the presence of a clear strategic goal specific to student exchange. While there was a significant relationship between the specific strategic goal of student <b>exchange</b> and <b>programme</b> participation rates, the implementation process appears to play a greater role in influencing student participation. It is suggested that the success of an <b>exchange</b> <b>programme</b> is moderated by organisational factors such as leadership and organisational culture, national government international education policies, and the level of resourcing and accountability.
