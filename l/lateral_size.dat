50|$|Primary S(T)EM {{electrons}} can {{be focused}} into spots {{as small as}} ~0.045 nm. While the smallest structures deposited so far by EBID are point deposits of ~0.7 nm diameter., deposits usually have a larger <b>lateral</b> <b>size</b> than the beam spot size. The reason are the so-called proximity effects, meaning that secondary, backscattered and forward scattered (if the beam dwells on already deposited material) electrons contribute to the deposition. As these electrons can leave the substrate up to several microns away {{from the point of}} impact of the electron beam (depending on its energy), material deposition is not necessarily confined to the irradiated spot. To overcome this problem, compensation algorithms can be applied, which is typical for electron beam lithography.|$|E

It was concluded {{that the presence of}} a considerable amount of single bonding carbons was the reason for the unique assembly structure accompanying with a strong D-band in Raman spectrum of SWNHs. The inside structure of SWNHs was examined by electron microscopy observations after focused ion beam (FIB) cutting.

30|$|In this paper, large-area {{ordered and}} size-controlled GeSi MQW nanopillar arrays with {{different}} nanopillar <b>lateral</b> <b>sizes</b> were fabricated {{by a combination}} of nanosphere lithography and dry etching. Compared to the as-grown GeSi MQWs, considerable enhancements in PL intensity have been observed in the GeSi MQW-NPA samples. The sample with the largest nanopillar size (270  nm) shows the most obvious enhancement. Three factors are analyzed quantitatively or qualitatively to explain the enhancements. One factor is the antireflection of the nanopillar structures. The second one is the light extraction efficiency in nanopillar arrays at the emission wavelength. In addition, the GeSi quantum wells in close proximity to the substrates would have more contribution to the PL than before etching, due to a large penetration depth for the incident light, which is the third factor. In our study, we focus on the quantitative analyses for the PL enhancements in the GeSi multi-quantum-well nanopillar arrays (MQW-NPAs) with different <b>lateral</b> <b>sizes.</b> These analyses will be helpful in understanding the optical properties of other microstructured materials.|$|R

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Here, we {{systematically}} investigated the spontaneous and stimulated emission performances of solution-processed atomically flat quasi- 2 D nanoplatelets (NPLs) {{as a function}} of their <b>lateral</b> <b>size</b> using colloidal CdSe core NPLs. We found that the photoluminescence quantum efficiency of these NPLs decreases with increasing <b>lateral</b> <b>size</b> while their photoluminescence decay rate accelerates. This strongly suggests that nonradiative channels prevail in the NPL ensembles having extended <b>lateral</b> <b>size,</b> which is well-explained by the increasing number of the defected NPL subpopulation. In the case of stimulated emission the role of <b>lateral</b> <b>size</b> in NPLs influentially emerges both in the single- and two-photon absorption (1 PA and 2 PA) pumping. In the amplified spontaneous emission measurements, we uncovered that the stimulated emission thresholds of 1 PA and 2 PA exhibit completely opposite behavior with increasing <b>lateral</b> <b>size.</b> The NPLs with larger lateral sizes exhibited higher stimulated emission thresholds under 1 PA pumping due to the dominating defected subpopulation in larger NPLs. On the other hand, surprisingly, larger NPLs remarkably revealed lower 2 PA-pumped amplified spontaneous emission thresholds. This is attributed to the observation of a "giant" 2 PA cross-section overwhelmingly growing with increasing <b>lateral</b> <b>size</b> and reaching record levels higher than 10 (6) GM, at least an order of magnitude stronger than colloidal quantum dots and rods.
