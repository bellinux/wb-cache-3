Liz reminds Jack that Mother's Day is coming up, prompting Jack to realize he forgot to send his mother Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch) flowers and informs his office assistant Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy) to send her flowers, however, Colleen is waiting outside Jack's office door. Colleen's real reason for visiting her son is that she <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> friend in Florida that Jack is dating Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore), a recent divorcée, {{and a woman who}} happens to be Jack's high school sweetheart. During dinner, Colleen does not bring Nancy up, but tells Jack she knows about his involvement with CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) after an awkward encounter between Avery and Jack in an elevator with Colleen present; because of the encounter, Colleen knows that Avery and Jack are sleeping together. Colleen is appalled that Jack is dating two women at the same time, and demands that he end it and make a choice between Nancy and Avery.|$|E
5|$|Torres {{goes into}} cardiac arrest and is taken into an {{operating}} room she is temporarily stabilized, pending further surgery. She is moved into intensive care, while neonatal surgeon Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) is flown in by helicopter {{in case the}} baby has to be delivered prematurely. Robbins and Sloan argue over Torres's treatment; Robbins believes that Torres would not risk endangering the baby, but Sloan argues for saving Torres at all costs. The attending surgeons devise a treatment plan, led by trauma surgeon Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd). As they do so, Torres dreams about the moments preceding the accident. Her dream self sings to Robbins, interspersed with shots of the hospital staff singing and dancing with their own partners. Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) suggests treating Torres with a high-risk but potentially effective cardiothoracic procedure she <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> old mentor, Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). Her current mentor, Teddy Altman (Kim Raver), refuses to perform it, but when Torres's condition deteriorates and she is rushed back into surgery, Hunt agrees that Yang should attempt the procedure.|$|E
25|$|She {{was born}} in the Manor of Linkaučiai near Krekenava, then Russian Empire, to the family of Juozas Povickas and Antanina Ona Liutkevičiūtė, petty Lithuanian nobles. The family's manor was confiscated for the {{participation}} in the Uprising of 1863 and the family moved to Antakalnis village southeast of Ukmergė. Several of her relatives on her mother's side died in the uprising or were deported to Siberia. As a child she visited her deported grandfather and two uncles in Insar. As such, Bortkevičienė grew up surrounded by anti-Tsarist attitudes. She spoke little Lithuanian that she <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> mother. Her father spoke Polish, but considered himself to be Lithuanian (see Polish-Lithuanian identity). By her own admission, she knew nothing of the Lithuanian National Revival before 1889.|$|E

25|$|The only clue into Marie de Romieu’s {{education}} is found {{through her body}} of work, which was heavily influenced by Pierre de Ronsard and classical writers such as Hesiod, Ovid and Virgil. It is speculated that she either <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> brother Jacques, or at least shared some of his lessons. In 1584, some of her works appear as introductory poems in her brother’s poetic anthology, which included Latin translations. Since her poetry included translations of Renaissance Neo-Latin Poets, it can be inferred that she was proficient in Latin, which suggests {{a higher level of}} education than most women, and one only attained by those in the elite. She may also have been fluent in Italian due to her translations of Italian authors such as Petrarch. However, her fluency in Italian is not certain, for French translations of the works were available at the time.|$|E
25|$|There {{were more}} than 20 people in Lanying’s family. But in her life, {{her mother and father}} {{influenced}} her most. Jianhua Lin, Lanying’s father, was a great educator. When Lanying was young, he stayed far from home and studied at the university. Although he did not stay with Lanying, he often wrote letters to Lanying and bought some books for her. So it was Jianhua that led Lanying into studying. Lanying’s mother was Shuixian Zhou. She was a very tough woman because she had to hold the whole family. Because of her personality, Lanying <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> and became persistent. Although Shuixian was deeply influenced by the gender schema, she helped Lanying to be a persistent person, so Lanying could conquer many difficulties in her life. Lanying had two brothers. After she came back from America, she helped raise two nieces because she had no child.|$|E
25|$|Her second book, now {{the best}} known of her works, Out of Africa, was {{published}} in 1937. Its success firmly established her reputation. Having <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> previous experience, Blixen published the book first in Denmark and the United Kingdom, and then in the United States. Garnering another Book-of-the-Month Club choice, Blixen was assured of not only sales for this new work, but also renewed interest in Seven Gothic Tales. She was awarded the Tagea Brandt Rejselegat (a Danish prize for women in the arts or academic life) in 1939. The work brought attention from critics who were concerned not only with literary appraisal of the book, but also with defining Blixen's intentions and morality. Post-colonial criticism has linked her with contemporary British writers and in some cases branded her as just another morally bankrupt white European aristocrat. Danish scholars have not typically made judgments about her morality, perhaps understanding that while elements of racism and colonial prejudices, given the context and era, are inherent in the work, her position as an outsider, a Dane and a woman made evaluating her, rather than the work, more complex. Some critics, including Carolyn Martin Shaw and Raoul Granqvist, have judged her to be a racist and a white supremacist, while other critics, such as Abdul R. JanMohamed, have recognized both her romanticized colonial attitudes and her understanding of colonial problems, as well as her concern and respect for African nationalists.|$|E

Here Seacole acquired her nursing skills.

McG found himself having to decide which ideas for references would be included and which would not. An opening scene has John fighting a Terminator on a crashed helicopter, which was storyboarded as a homage to the climax of the original film, where his mother Sarah, having broken her leg, is chased by a crippled Terminator. McG did this to reflect the skills John <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
500|$|According to Gillespie, she hosted several {{celebrations}} {{per year}} at her main residence in Winston-Salem; [...] "her skill {{in the kitchen}} {{is the stuff of}} legend—from haute cuisine to down-home comfort food".

[...] The New York Times, describing Angelou's residence history in New York City, stated that she regularly hosted elaborate New Year's Day parties. [...] She combined her cooking and writing skills in her 2004 book Hallelujah! The Welcome Table, which featured 73 recipes, many of which she <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> grandmother and mother, accompanied by 28 vignettes.

500|$|Lloyd {{established}} her {{new name}} on 22 June 1886, with an {{appearance at the}} Falstaff Music Hall, where she attracted wide notice for the song [...] "The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery" [...] (which was initially written for Nelly Power by Lloyd's agent George Ware). By 1887, her performance of the song had become so popular {{that she was in}} demand in London's West End, including the Oxford Music Hall, where she excelled at skirt dancing. George Belmont, the Falstaff's proprietor, secured her an engagement at the Star Palace of Varieties in Bermondsey. She soon began making her own costumes, a skill she <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> mother, and one she used {{for the rest of her}} career. She undertook a month-long tour of Ireland at the start of 1886, earning £10 per week after which she returned to East London to perform at, amongst others, the Sebright Music Hall, Bethnal Green. On 23 October, The Era called her [...] "a pretty little soubrette who dances with great dash and energy." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{boys were}} taught at Confucian academies for the {{ultimate}} goal of government service, girls were often taught by their brothers how to read and write. By Song times, more women of the upper and educated classes were able to read due to advances in widespread printing, leaving behind a treasury of letters, poems, and other documents penned by women. Some women were educated enough to teach their sons before they were sent to an official school. For example, the mother of the statesman and scientist Shen Kuo taught him basic education and even military strategy that she had <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> elder brother. Hu Wenrou, a granddaughter of a famous Song official Hu Su, was regarded by Shen Kuo as a remarkable female mathematician, as Shen would occasionally relay questions to Hu Wenrou through her husband in order for her to review and investigate possible errors in his mathematical work. Li Qingzhao (1084–1151), whose father was a friend of Su Shi, wrote many poems throughout her often turbulent life (only about 100 of these survive) and became a renowned poet during her lifetime. After the death of her husband, she wrote poems profusely about poring over his paintings, calligraphy, and ancient bronze vessels, as well as poems with deep emotional longing: ...|$|E
500|$|Similar {{to most of}} {{the songs}} from Light Years, [...] "Spinning Around" [...] is a [...] "string-laden" [...] dance-pop track with {{prominent}} influences from disco music. According to the sheet music of the song published by BMG Rights Management at Musicnotes.com, it is composed in the key of F minor and features a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute. Minogue's vocal range spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of C5. Addressing the theme of reinvention, the lyrics declare that Minogue has changed and <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> past mistakes; it contains lines like [...] "I'm spinning around/Move out of my way... I'm not the same" [...] and [...] "Mistakes that I made have given me the strength to really believe." [...] In an analysis of the lyrics of the song, Pom Avoledo from Blogcritics wrote that Minogue demands attention in the chorus towards the changes in her personality and asserts that people appreciate them, in the line [...] "I know you're feelin me cause you like it like this." [...] The first verse deals with Minogue ridding herself of items and symbols from her past and starting afresh, evidenced in lines like [...] "Threw away my old clothes, got myself a better wardrobe." [...] The critic felt that in the second verse Minogue faces her mistakes and accepts herself as she is. The bridge of the song features the repetition of the hook [...] "You know you like it like this," [...] with Minogue's voice being vocoded. Chris True from AllMusic felt that through the lyrics, Minogue was admitting that releasing Impossible Princess in 1997 was not the best decision.|$|E
