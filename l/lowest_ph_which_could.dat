40|$|The small {{hydrophobic}} (SH) {{protein is}} a 64 -amino-acid polypeptide encoded {{by the human}} respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV). SH protein has a single α-helical transmembrane (TM) domain that forms pentameric ion channels. Herein, we report the first inhibitor of the SH protein channel, pyronin B, and we have mapped its binding site to a conserved surface of the RSV SH pentamer, at the C-terminal end of the transmembrane domain. The validity of the SH protein structural model used has been confirmed by using a bicellar membrane-mimicking environment. However, in bicelles the α-helical stretch of the TM domain extends up to His- 51, and by comparison with previous models both His- 22 and His- 51 adopt an interhelical/lumenal orientation relative to the channel pore. Neither His residue {{was found to be}} essential for channel activity although His- 51 protonation reduced channel activity at <b>low</b> <b>pH,</b> with His- 22 adopting a more structural role. The latter results are in contrast with previous patch clamp data showing channel activation at <b>low</b> <b>pH,</b> <b>which</b> <b>could</b> not be reproduced in the present work. Overall, these results establish a solid ground for future drug development targeting this important viroporin. J.

DLS measurements of dilute mucin solutions were not indicative of intermolecular association, yet there was a steady fall in the measured diffusion coefficient with decreasing pH, suggesting an apparent increase in size. Taken together with the observed rise in depolarized scattering ratio with decreasing pH, these results suggest that gastric mucin undergoes a conformational change from a random coil at pH >/= 4 to an anisotropic, extended conformation at pH < 4. The increased binding of mucin to hydrophobic fluorescent with decreasing pH indicates that the change to an extended conformation is accompanied by exposure of hydrophobic binding sites. In concentrated mucin solutions, the structure factor S(q, t) derived from DLS measurements changed from a stretched exponential decay at pH 7 to a power-law decay at <b>pH</b> 2, <b>which</b> is characteristic of a sol-gel transition.

This finding has significance for medical applications, when high concentration of the peptide is injected into blood and diluted in blood circulation.

Methods and Results: Stationary-phase cultures of S. enterica serovar Enteritidis and serovar Typhimurium (one strain of each) were exposed to pH 2 Æ 5 for up to 4 h, followed by growth at pH 7 for 48 h. This process was repeated 15 times in two separate experiments, which increased the acid resistance of the three out of four populations we obtained, by three- to fourfold. Sustainable variants derived from the populations showed changes in colony morphology, expression of SEF 17 fimbriae, growth, increased heat resistance and reduced virulence.

We found that JSRV Env induced syncytia in cells overexpressing the receptor for JSRV and that a <b>low</b> <b>pH</b> was required for this process to occur. Fusion kinetics studies revealed that cell-cell fusion by JSRV Env at neutral pH was poor, taking up to a day, {{in sharp contrast to}} fusion at <b>low</b> <b>pH,</b> <b>which</b> peaked within 2 min following a low-pH trigger. Deletion of the C-terminal 7 or 16 amino acids of the JSRV Env CT had no or little effect on fusion, yet additional truncation toward the membrane-spanning domain, resulting in mutants retaining as little as 1 amino acid of the CT, led to progressively increased syncytium formation at neutral pH that was further enhanced by low-pH treatment. Notably, the severely truncated mutants showed elevated levels of surface subunits in culture medium, suggesting that the CT truncations resulted in conformational changes in the ectodomain of Env that impaired surface subunit associations.
