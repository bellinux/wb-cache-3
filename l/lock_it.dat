5|$|All of Uranus's moons {{are named}} after {{characters}} from {{the works of}} William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock. The names of all four satellites of Uranus then known were suggested by John Herschel in 1852 {{at the request of}} Lassell. Ariel is named after the leading sylph in The Rape of the <b>Lock.</b> <b>It</b> is also the name of the spirit who serves Prospero in Shakespeare's The Tempest. The moon is also designated UranusI.|$|E
5|$|The Orange Bike {{program began}} in 2008 {{as part of}} an {{increase}} in campus sustainability.

25|$|Anton's Gowt lock is , but {{although}} a boat {{of this size}} could pass through it, most of the drains are inaccessible to such large craft. The only other working lock is at Cowbridge, which is , and gives access to the Maud Foster drain, enabling boats to visit the centre of Boston. From Cowbridge <b>Lock</b> <b>it</b> is also possible to visit the Lincolnshire Wolds, using the Stonebridge Drain and the East Fen and West Fen Catchwater Drains.|$|E
25|$|However, if {{the river}} floods beyond a safe limit for the canal, then the gates are closed (and an extra lock created) until the river drops again. Since {{this is a}} true <b>lock</b> <b>it</b> is {{possible}} for boats to leave the canal for the flooded river despite the difference in water levels (though this {{is not likely to}} be wise) or (more sensibly) to allow boats caught out on the flood to gain refuge in the canal.|$|E
25|$|Some narrow locks (e.g. on Birmingham Canal Navigations) go even further. They have single gates at {{the lower}} end also. This speeds up passage, even though single lower gates are heavy (heavier than a single upper gate, because the lower gate is taller) and the lock has to be longer (a lower gate opens INTO the <b>lock,</b> <b>it</b> has to pass the bow or stern of an {{enclosed}} boat, and a single gate has a wider arc than two half-gates).|$|E

25|$|Sometimes {{known as}} bike library systems, these {{bicycles}} may be lent free of charge, for a refundable deposit, {{or for a}} small fee. A bicycle is checked out to one person who will typically keep the bike for several months, and is encouraged or obliged to <b>lock</b> <b>it</b> between uses. A disadvantage of this system is a lower usage frequency, around three uses per day on average as compared to 10 to 15 uses per day typically experienced with other bike-sharing schemes.|$|E
25|$|A {{testimony}} describes {{attacks on}} an ambulance: When the ambulance arrived at al-Brazil {{to pick up}} a woman and her three wounded children, Israeli tanks fired. With bulldozers and tanks, the ambulance was surrounded. A bulldozer started to place sand barriers in front of the ambulance, while another bulldozer was demolishing houses and putting the ruins behind the ambulance to <b>lock</b> <b>it</b> in. When the medical workers tried to leave the car, Israeli tanks fired. After 3 hours, the army started to remove the barriers and the ambulance returned, without the wounded civilians.|$|E
25|$|The Lewis gun was gas operated. A {{portion of}} the {{expanding}} propellant gas was tapped off from the barrel, driving a piston to the rear against a spring. The piston was fitted with a vertical post at its rear which rode in a helical cam track in the bolt, rotating {{it at the end}} of its travel nearest the breech. This allowed the three locking lugs at the rear of the bolt to engage in recesses in the gun's body to <b>lock</b> <b>it</b> into place. The post also carried a fixed firing pin, which protruded through an aperture in the front of the bolt, firing the next round at the foremost part of the piston's travel.|$|E

25|$|Typically ABS {{includes}} a central {{electronic control unit}} (ECU), four wheel speed sensors, {{and at least two}} hydraulic valves within the brake hydraulics. The ECU constantly monitors the rotational speed of each wheel; if it detects the wheel rotating significantly slower than the speed of the vehicle, a condition indicative of impending wheel <b>lock,</b> <b>it</b> actuates the valves to reduce hydraulic pressure to the brake at the affected wheel, thus reducing the braking force on that wheel; the wheel then turns faster. Conversely, if the ECU detects a wheel turning significantly faster than the others, brake hydraulic pressure to the wheel is increased so the braking force is reapplied, slowing down the wheel. This process is repeated continuously and can be detected by the driver via brake pedal pulsation. Some anti-lock systems can apply or release braking pressure 15 times per second. Because of this, the wheels of cars equipped with ABS are practically impossible to lock even during panic braking in extreme conditions.|$|E
25|$|Five days later, on July 23, 1836, {{a band of}} Seminole {{attacked}} the lighthouse. Thompson and Carter reached the lighthouse tower; Thompson later recounted feeling rifle balls go through his clothes and hat. The Seminoles grabbed the door just after he turned the key to <b>lock</b> <b>it.</b> Thompson exchanged rifle fire with the Seminoles from upper windows in the tower {{for the rest of}} the day but after dark, the raiders approached the tower, setting fire to the door and a boarded-up window at ground level. Rifle balls had penetrated tanks in the bottom of the tower, which held 225 gallons of lamp oil for the light, and the oil caught fire. Thompson's clothing had been soaked with oil, and he and Carter retreated to the top of the tower, taking a keg of gunpowder, balls, and a rifle with them. The two men cut away a part of the wooden stairway below them in the tower before being driven out of the top by the searing flames.|$|E

500|$|The {{money is}} divided into three unequal shares. The [...] "A" [...] share is 60% of the team's bank; the [...] "B" [...] share is 30%; the [...] "C" [...] share is 10%. The team has 100 seconds to agree on who should receive which share. Once the clock starts, the money begins to drain away. Each {{contestant}} must claim a different share, and the team must <b>lock</b> <b>it</b> in to stop the clock and claim the remaining money. If after 50 seconds, no agreement is made, the clock stops briefly, and each contestant, in turn, is given 10 seconds to explain which share they feel they deserve and why. Once each player has pleaded their case, the clock restarts and the money continues to drain. If no agreement is reached, all three contestants leave the show with no money. If all questions are answered correctly, the top prize is worth up to $51,000 (60% of the maximum total bank of $85,000).|$|E
500|$|The weir at Frodsham {{was built}} in 1785, {{although}} it has been altered subsequently. The main curved section is [...] wide, and there are two [...] sluices at the southern end. The adjacent lock, which was designed by Robert Pownall and George Leigh in 1781, was modified in 1830 and later, but most traffic was using the Weston cut {{by the time of the}} 1890s upgrade, and so it retained some of its original features. It is derelict, and water flow is controlled by a concrete and steel sluice erected in the mid 20th century. A red sandstone and limestone bridge carries the A56 road over the channel below the <b>lock.</b> <b>It</b> {{was built in}} 1850, and has three [...] arches. The A56 crosses the main channel on Sutton swing bridge, which was built in the 1920s. There have been problems with the stability of the road surface, and options to secure its long-term future and appearance were discussed in 2010. Frodsham viaduct, completed in 1850 and built in brown bricks with a cast-iron central arch, was built for the Birkenhead, Lancs & Cheshire Junction Railway by the contractor Thomas Brassey. The engineer for the project was Alexander Rendel.|$|E
500|$|In April 2016, Most Wanted {{was seen}} to be [...] "a no-brainer" [...] for a series pick-up by {{industry}} insiders.

At that time, the producers were prepping [...] "if-come" [...] orders, [...] "deals with writers that will come into effect in the event a pilot is picked [...] to series". On May 12, 2016, the pilot was passed on by ABC, with Lee's successor Channing Dungey explaining that Most Wanted [...] "did not feel as strong as some of the other pilots that we shot. We talked about it with Marvel and we all came to an agreement that we want {{to figure out what the}} next show is that we do together, is something that we all feel is as creatively strong as it can be." [...] However, Dungey said that ABC was open to the series being shopped to another network if Marvel found [...] "another home" [...] for it. Loeb also acknowledged this possibility, but said that the series was designed [...] "to do a very specific thing" [...] alongside S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC.|$|E

500|$|MPC {{additionally}} {{worked on}} the disappearing waterfall that serves as Jennifer's grave when she is killed {{at the beginning of}} the film. They transformed the mysterious waterfall into a whirlpool. [...] "We came up with an approach that we thought would work because we had a lot of confidence in our water sims", stated Nordby. [...] "The waterfall appears both as a day and night shot, so we had to integrate with the water. And the night shots play a pivotal role in the film, and we do a huge crane over." [...] They could not <b>lock</b> <b>it</b> to a pan or to a tilt and filming the shots was difficult due to the actual base of the waterfall being out of reach. Nordby said, [...] "I eventually lowered down a shot—a ton of reference of the area because I knew we'd have to do some digi-matte work to recreate the basin that the whirlpool ends up in." [...] They soon realized that there was an insufficient amount of churning and foam to read as real as the location. The CG Supervisor, Pete Dionne, presented a different idea. [...] "He grabbed chunks of that river and tialing it so that it had a nice stretch of birds' eye point of view of the water that existed on the location in the lighting situation we were trying to match", stated Nordby. [...] "And then he projected that onto a whirlpool of animated sprites and had similar enough texture to the actual water that existed there, but pulled control into lighting it and could add depth mainly to the center of it." [...] Dealing with [...] "very shallow" [...] water, the team had to take extra care when filming the scenes.|$|E
