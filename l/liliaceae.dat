5|$|Classifications {{published}} {{since the}} use of molecular phylogenetics have taken a narrower view of the <b>Liliaceae</b> (s.s.). In 1998, Tamura considered Calochortus sufficiently distinct to elevate the subfamily Calochortoideae to family status as Calochortaceae, resulting in the term <b>Liliaceae</b> sensu Tamura to indicate <b>Liliaceae</b> without the Calochortoideae. In 2009, Takhtajan used an even narrower definition (see Table 2 & Table 3 below).|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of the originally broadly defined <b>Liliaceae</b> s.l., many {{attempts have been made to}} form suprageneric classifications, e.g. subfamilies and tribes. Classifications published since the use of molecular methods in phylogenetics have taken a narrower view of the <b>Liliaceae</b> (<b>Liliaceae</b> s.s.). The Angiosperm Phylogeny Website (APweb) recognizes three subfamilies, one of which is divided into two tribes.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the {{inclusion}} of genera within <b>Liliaceae</b> has been extremely broad. Of the various published systems, {{one of the best}} known and also the broadest modern circumscription is the Cronquist system (1981), which included nearly 300 genera in <b>Liliaceae.</b> Most of these have been reassigned to other families, as shown in the following collapsed list, following ITIS, together with their disposition as APG III transfers to other families and subfamilies, within Liliales and three other orders, Alismatales, Asparagales and Dioscoreales.

5|$|Sequencing of the rbcL and matK {{chloroplast}} {{genes of}} Lilium and related genera confirmed the circumscription {{of the family}} in the sensu stricto usage of Tamura (1998). Chloroplast ndhF gene sequencing also supported <b>Liliaceae</b> monophyly, reuniting the <b>Liliaceae</b> sensu Tamura and Calochortaceae sensu Tamura (see Table 2 & Table 3 below).|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of a phylogenetic approach to taxonomy suggested the Liliales formed {{some of the earliest}} monocots. Molecular analysis indicates that divergence amongst the Liliales probably occurred around 82 million years ago. The closest sister family to the <b>Liliaceae</b> are the Smilacaceae with the <b>Liliaceae</b> separating 52 million years ago. <b>Liliaceae</b> thus arose during the late (Maastrichtian) Cretaceous to early (Paleocene) Paleogene periods. Major evolutionary clades include the Lilieae (Lilium, Fritillaria, Nomocharis, Cardiocrinum, Notholirion) from the Himalayas about 12mya and the Tulipeae (Erythronium, Tulipa, Gagea) from East Asia at about the same time. The Medeoleae (Clintonia and Medeola) may have appeared in North America but were subsequently dispersed, as may have the Streptopoideae and Calochortoideae. <b>Liliaceae</b> fossils have been dated to the Paleogene and Cretaceous eras in the Antarctic.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{now having}} {{established}} a taxonomic grouping for the <b>Liliaceae</b> family that is genetically monophyletic, {{compared to the}} prior longstanding polyphyletic assemblages under this name, the morphology remains diverse, and there exists within the <b>Liliaceae</b> clade a number of subclades. There appeared to be two major clades, the first and largest of these consisted of three subclades: Clintonia—Medeola—Gagea, Lilium Fritillaria—Notholirion, and Tulipa—Erythronium. The second smaller clade, Streptopus—Tricyrtis contained elements of Dahlgren's Uvulariaceae. The position of Calochortus remained problematic, being considered a sister clade to <b>Liliaceae,</b> as treated by Tamura, but further analysis suggested {{it was in fact}} sister to Tricyrtis, although it is now considered separate once again (see Table 3).|$|E

5|$|The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) made rapid {{progress}} {{in establishing a}} modern monophyletic classification of the flowering plants by 2009. Despite establishing this relative degree of monophyly (genetic homogeneity) for the <b>Liliaceae</b> family, their morphology remains diverse and there exists within the <b>Liliaceae</b> clade or grouping, a number of subclades (subgroups). Particularly enigmatic were Clintonia, Medeola, Scoliopus, and Tricyrtis.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Liliaceae</b> are ecologically diverse. Species of <b>Liliaceae</b> bloom {{at various}} times from spring to late summer. The {{colorful}} flowers produce large amounts of nectar and pollen that attract insects which pollinate them (entomophily), particularly bees and wasps (hymenopterophily), butterflies (psychophily) and moths (phalaenophily). The seeds are dispersed by wind and water. Some species (e.g. Scoliopus, Erythronium and Gagea) have seeds with an aril structure that are dispersed by ants (myrmecochory).|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} and phylogenetic {{relationships between}} the genera currently included in <b>Liliaceae</b> are shown in Cladogram III.|$|E
50|$|The {{bell-shaped}} {{white flowers}} have greenish stripes and are {{set on a}} nodding pedicel of about 37 centimeters in height. The blossoms are odorless to faintly fragrant. Fritillia <b>liliacea</b> prefers heavy soils including clays; for example, andesitic and basaltic soils derived from the Sonoma Volcanic soil layers are suitable substrate for this species.|$|R
40|$|The genome size {{of plants}} shows a {{thousand}} fold variation from the 150 Mb genome of Arabidopsis to the 140, 000 Mb genome of Fritillaria. Much of this variation in genome size {{is due to}} changes in the amount of non-coding DNA. Genome complexity, in contrast to genome size, is determined in large part by the number of genes but gene number and family organization are poorly characterized in most organisms. In this study I have characterized the number and type of family members from the histone-like protein gene family in Fritillaria <b>liliacea.</b> The experimental approach involves exhaustive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification followed by cloning. Selected clones were sequenced and phylogenetic analyses were performed to determine the relationship among family members. The histone-like gene family in Fritillaria <b>liliacea</b> consists of two functional genes, which may be allelic and 12 processed pseudogenes. In contrast the histone-like protein gene family in Arabidopsis consists of only one functional gene without any pseudogenes. During the course of this study, a new histone-like protein related gene family was identified. This gene family consists of 5 - 8 functional genes and 4 classical pseudogenes...|$|R
5000|$|The Diablo Range {{is part of}} the California {{interior}} chaparral and woodlands ecoregion. It {{is covered}} mostly by chaparral and California oak woodland communities, with stands of closed-cone pine forests appearing above 4,000 feet (1,219 m). The [...] savanna has been predominantly replaced by annual Mediterranean grasses, except in some rare habitat fragments. The understory is dominated with nonnative invasives. Blooming in spring are such plants as Viola pedunculata, Dodecatheon pulchellum, Fritillaria <b>liliacea,</b> and Ribes malvaceum, which can be viewed in the Blue Oak Ranch Reserve.|$|R
5|$|The family evolved {{approximately}} 52 {{million years}} ago during the Late Cretaceous to Early Paleogene eras. <b>Liliaceae</b> are widely distributed, mainly in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and the flowers are insect pollinated. Many <b>Liliaceae</b> are important ornamental plants, widely grown for their attractive flowers and involved in a major floriculture of cut flowers and dry bulbs. Some species are poisonous if eaten and can have adverse health effects in humans and household pets.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the <b>Liliaceae</b> {{has a very}} complex history. The family was first described in the eighteenth century, and over time many other genera were added until it {{became one of the}} largest of the monocotyledon families, and also extremely diverse. Modern taxonomic systems, such as the APG which is based on phylogenetic principles using molecular biology, have redistributed many of these genera resulting in the relatively small family that is currently recognised. Consequently, there are many different accounts of the <b>Liliaceae</b> in the literature and older uses of the term occur commonly. To distinguish between them, the Latin terms sensu lato and sensu stricto are frequently used (together with their abbreviations, s.l. and s.s.) to denote the broader or stricter sense of the circumscription respectively, e.g. <b>Liliaceae</b> s.s..|$|E
5|$|These studies, {{together}} with other analyses within each of these two orders, allowed the redistribution of the original genera of <b>Liliaceae</b> s.l. {{into a variety of}} families across the Liliales and Asparagales, as illustrated in Cladogram 1. This redistribution resulted in considerable changes both in the suprafamilial positioning of <b>Liliaceae</b> within the overall APG classification (as shown in Table 1 below), as well as the subfamilial structure (see Suprageneric subdivisions).|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} social wasps {{was made in}} the area of the "Ferreira Penna" Research Station (ECFPn) in Caxiuanã, PA, Brazil. Traditional {{collecting}} methods as the use of Malaise traps and the search for individuals and colonies of wasps along trails in the forest and by river margins, were applied in a more systematized fashion. Seventy-nine species belonging to 18 genera were discovered within a discontinuous period of 52 days of collecting. Angiopolybia pallens, Polybia <b>liliacea,</b> and several Agelaia species were the most frequently collected species. Active search for wasps in the forest and by river margins was far more efficient than Malaise traps regarding the discovery of polistine species...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} types of ovarian {{development}} seen among P. rejecta. The first type is when one ovary has one [...] ovariole but no visible oocytes or very small oocytes. An ovariole {{is one of the}} tubes of the ovaries of a wasp and the oocytes are what will potentially become eggs. This means that this first type of wasp is not capable of reproducing. A second type contains one ovariole with some young underdeveloped oocytes. This type of wasp is also non-reproductive, meaning that the workers will have one of these types of ovarian development. The third type is that of the queen and is well developed with very long ovarioles The ovarioles are coiled inside a gaster with at least one mature egg. The queens are the only females that are inseminated. This difference in ovary size is also seen in the wasp species Chartergus mentanotalis, Epipona tatua, and Polybia <b>liliacea.</b>|$|R
40|$|A dark septate fungus of Pseudosigmoidea, Hyphomycetes, was {{recovered}} from forest soil in Ibaraki prefecture, Japan. The isolate {{is characterized by}} pale to brown conidia with up to 8 septa measuring 68 – 132 × 4 – 7. 9 µm. It is also unique in producing conidia borne by long conidogenious cells in agar medium with or without water, compared to P. cranei, which must be immersed in water to sporulate. Morphological analysis indicated that the isolate is distinct from P. cranei and {{is described as a}} new species, P. ibarakiensis sp. nov. Pathogenicity tests of Chinese cabbage and cucumber seedlings indicated that the fungus grows as an endophyte and colonizes, inter and intracellularly, the root epidermal and cortical layers without causing apparent disease symptoms in the host. This endophyte showed the ability to support cucumber plant growth under conditions where NaNO 3 was replaced by organic nitrogen but also conferred to Chinese cabbage the ability to grow at low pH. It also became successfully established in six other plants, including the Brassicae, Solanaceae, Poaceae, and <b>Liliacea</b> families, suggesting its adaptability to a broad range of host plants. Key words: Pseudosigmoidea, Hyphomycetes, taxonomy, endophyte, environmental stress Fungal endophytes are fungi that colonize the internal tissues of living plants without causing any external disease symptoms.

5|$|Also enigmatic were Clintonia, Medeola, Scoliopus, and Tricyrtis. Clintonia, with a disjunct {{distribution}} involving East Asia and North America, and the {{closely related}} Medeola form a subclades {{and are now}} considered a separate tribe (Medeoleae) within the Lilioideae, although at different times they have been considered a separate subfamily (Medeoloideae) or family (Medeolaceae). Sequencing of the rbcL and matK chloroplast genes established monophyly for Clintonia, but with separate clades corresponding to the two areas of distribution. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Website (APWeb) includes four of Takhtajan's families in <b>Liliaceae,</b> recognizing three subfamilies, {{one of which is}} divided into two tribes and referred to as <b>Liliaceae</b> sensu APG III.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of the originally broadly defined <b>Liliaceae</b> (s.l.), many {{attempts have been made to}} form supageneric classification systems, organizing the genera into subfamilies, tribes, or other suprageneric taxa (taxonomic groupings between genus and family). By 1813, Candolle recognised five subdivisions which he called tribes (Asparagées, Trilliacées, Asphodelées, Bromeliées, Tulipacées), all of which Jussieu had made separate families, with the exception of Tulipa, which was a genus within the <b>Liliaceae.</b> By 1845, John Lindley observed that the family had become extremely diverse, ill-defined and unstable, not only by its overall circumscription, but also by its subdivisions. For the 133 genera he included, he described eleven suborders. By the 1870s, as Baker describes in his revision of the family, the taxonomy of <b>Liliaceae</b> had become vast and complicated. His approach was to divide the family into eight tribes.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, a {{revision}} of the North American <b>Liliaceae</b> by Sereno Watson described sixteen tribes, of which the Lilieae correspond most closely to current concepts of the family, Bentham and Hooker described twenty tribes in 1883, and Engler and Prantl in their extensive description of the <b>Liliaceae</b> in 1899 identified 31 tribes distributed over 11 subfamilies, with Tulipeae and Alieae representing the modern family. In 1936, Franz Buxbaum undertook a major revision of the <b>Liliaceae</b> and among others described the subfamily Lilioideae with three tribes: Lloydieae (Gagea, Lloydia and Szechenya and Giradiella — both now included in Lloydia), Tulipeae (Erythronium, Tulipa and Eduardoregalia — now part of Tulipa) and Lilieae (Korolkowia, Fritillaria, Notholirion, Cardiocrinum, Nomocharis and Lilium). Hutchinson included most of these genera within the Tulipeae tribe. The complex rearrangements of the various genera, tribes and subfamilies over a 30-year period from 1985, discussed by Peruzzi and colleagues (2009), are partly summarised in Table 2 below.|$|E
40|$|Cyclopamine (1) was {{isolated}} from the plant Veratrum californicum Durand (<b>Liliacea)</b> and identified as the teratogen responsible for severe craniofacial birth defects including cyclops in the offspring of sheep grazing on mountain ranges in central Idaho. More recently, cyclopamine (1) was found to inhibit the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway which plays {{a critical role in}} embryonic development and is implicated in several types of cancer. Thus, cyclopamine (1) and cyclopamine derivatives have been targeted as potential pharmaceutical treatments for certain cancers and other diseases associated with the Hh signaling pathway. A monoclonal antibody-based competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed to detect and measure cyclopamine (1) and cyclopamine derivatives in biological samples. The limits of detection of the assay for cyclopamine (1), 3 -keto-N-aminoethyl aminocaproyl digyrocinnamoyl-cyclopamine (8), and N-(4 -l-rhamnopyranosyl- 1 H- 1, 2, 3 -triazol- 1 -yl) -methylcyclopamine (11) were 2. 9 pg, 0. 41 pg and 2. 6 pg, respectively. This assay was also found to be useful for the detection and measurement of cyclopamine (1) in sera from mice that had been dosed with cyclopamine (1). The simple ELISA method described herein demonstrates the potential of using these techniques for the rapid screening of biological samples for the presence and levels of cyclopamine (1) and other cyclopamine derivatives that are Hh inhibitors with anticancer potential...|$|R
40|$|Allium sativum L. (<b>Liliacea)</b> is a {{perennial}} bulb with a tall, erect flowering stem. The bulb {{of the plant}} {{has been used in}} many parts of the world as a stimulant, carminative, antiseptic, expectorant, anthelmintic and diuretic. This study has been planned to assess the diuretic activity of fresh garlic bulb extract targeting the steroidal and triterpenoidal saponin content. The rats were randomly divided into 4 groups of 5 animal each as vehicle control (2 % tragacanth suspension), standard drug frusemide (20 mg/kg, p. o), and n-butanol extract (10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, p. o) treated. Urine was collected in a graduated cylinder and its volume was measured for next 5 hr. Na +, K + and Cl- concentrations were measured. Phytochemical analysis of A. sativum n-butanol fraction showed presence of steroids, triterpenoidal saponins and carbohydrates. At 20 mg/kg dose onset of diuresis and total volume of urine formed was significantly (P< 0. 01 - 0. 05) higher. Fifth hour urine volume at 20 mg/kg dose was 9. 3 ml as compared to 5. 5 ml of control. Extract at 20 mg/kg dose produced 24. 57 % increase in Na + excretion against 132. 65 % increase by frusemide when compared to control signifying natriuretic and aquaretic response.

5|$|Many other botanists echoed Lindley's earlier {{concerns}} about the phylogeny of the <b>Liliaceae,</b> but various schemes to divide the family gained little traction. Dahlgren (1985) suggested there were in fact forty – not one – families distributed over three orders (predominantly Liliales and Asparagales). In {{the context of a}} general review of the classification of angiosperms, the <b>Liliaceae</b> were subjected to more intense scrutiny. Considerable progress in plant phylogeny and phylogenetic theory enabled a phylogenetic tree to be constructed for all of the flowering plants, as elaborated by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (1998).|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} of Liliales is {{relatively}} poor, but <b>Liliaceae</b> fossils have been dated to the Paleogene and Cretaceous periods in the Antarctic.|$|E
5|$|Within the <b>Liliaceae</b> sensu Dahlgren there {{developed}} {{two main}} evolutionary subclades (see Cladogram II and Table 3). The first of these, characterised as the Lilieae s.s. (Lilium, Fritillaria, Nomocharis), Cardiocrinum), Notholirion) diverged around 12mya. The second subclade was the Tulipeae (Erythronium, Tulipa), (Gagea). Divergence within Calochortus is dated to 7mya. This places {{the emergence of}} the <b>Liliaceae</b> at approximately the last (Maastrichtian period) of the Late Cretaceous periods (72 to 66mya) to early (Paleocene) Paleogene periods (66 to 23mya), formerly the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary, 65mya.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} <b>Liliaceae</b> genera are popular {{cultivated}} plants {{in private and}} public spaces. Lilies and tulips in particular have had considerable symbolic and decorative value, and appear frequently in paintings and the decorative arts. They are also an economically important product.|$|E
5|$|Although many Lilium {{species such}} as Lilium martagon and Lilium candidum can be {{obtained}} commercially, the majority of commercially available lilies represent the products of a very diverse hybridisation program, which {{has resulted in a}} separate horticultural classification, including such groupings as Asian, Oriental and Orienpet. In addition to a very wide variety of heights, lilies can be obtained in many colours and combinations of colours, and if properly selected can produce an extensive blooming season from early summer to autumn. Because of the history of <b>Liliaceae,</b> many {{species such as}} Watsonia (bugle lily) that were previously classified in this family bear the name 'lily' but are neither part of the genus Lilium, or the <b>Liliaceae</b> family.|$|E
5|$|<b>Liliaceae</b> sensu Dahlgren {{arose in}} Eurasia, while within <b>Liliaceae</b> sensu Dahlgren the Lilieae s.s. subclade {{arose in the}} Himalayas (Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau), with later {{radiation}} there in montane and alpine habitats. Species of Lilium and Fritillaria then dispersed {{into the rest of}} Eurasia and North America. The second subclade, the Tulipeae arose in East Asia with subsequent colonisation of North America by Erythronium and Lloydia. On the other hand, Clintonia-Medeola (Medeoleae) may have appeared in North America but subsequently underwent intercontintental dispersal (although some evidence points to a Eurasian origin). The Calochortaceae sensu Tamura (Streptopoideae and Calochortoideae) appears to have evolved in western North America, with subsequent colonisation of East Asia by Streptopus and the ancestral Tricyrtis.|$|E
5|$|Lilioid monocots (lilioids, liliid monocots, petaloid monocots, petaloid lilioid monocots) is an {{informal}} name {{used for a}} grade (grouping of taxa with common characteristics) of five monocot orders (Petrosaviales, Dioscoreales, Pandanales, Liliales and Asparagales) in which the majority of species have flowers with relatively large, coloured tepals. This characteristic {{is similar to that}} found in lilies ("lily-like"). Petaloid monocots refers to the flowers having tepals which all resemble petals (petaloid). The taxonomic terms Lilianae or Liliiflorae have also been applied to this assemblage at various times. From the early nineteenth century many of the species in this group of plants were put into a very broadly defined family, <b>Liliaceae</b> sensu lato or s.l. (lily family). These classification systems are still found in many books and other sources. Within the monocots the <b>Liliaceae</b> s.l. were distinguished from the Glumaceae.|$|E
