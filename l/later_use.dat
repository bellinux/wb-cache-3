5|$|After {{only seven}} months (221 days) of {{official}} availability, the third-generation iPad was discontinued on October 23, 2012, following {{the announcement of}} the fourth generation iPad. The third-generation iPad had the shortest lifespan of any iOS product. It is also the last iPad to support the 30-pin dock connector, as the fourth generation iPad and <b>later</b> <b>use</b> the Lightning connector.|$|E
5|$|Apples are an {{important}} ingredient in many desserts, such as apple pie, apple crumble, apple crisp and apple cake. They are often eaten baked or stewed, and {{they can also be}} dried and eaten or reconstituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid) for <b>later</b> <b>use.</b> When cooked, some apple cultivars easily form a puree known as apple sauce. Apples are also made into apple butter and apple jelly. They are also used (cooked) in meat dishes.|$|E
5|$|Babb, {{who gained}} notoriety for his various {{marketing}} gimmicks, occasionally had Leeds make appearances and give lectures at showings of the film. Babb often booked the movie as a midnight presentation {{twice a week}} in the same town; David F. Friedman, who would <b>later</b> <b>use</b> the film in his own double-billings, attributed the distribution plan to a film that was so low in quality that Babb wanted to cash in and move to his next stop as fast as possible.|$|E

5|$|Construction resumed in 1901 on {{a portion}} of the {{southern}} route, to build a spur line to service coal mines on the Wasatch Plateau. The railroad branched from an existing line at Salina and traveled east up Salina Canyon. After the mines closed, the railroad bed was used to improve State Route 10, between Salina and Fremont Junction. I-70 would <b>later</b> <b>use</b> the railroad bed for a path across the Wasatch Plateau.|$|E
5|$|Software was {{distributed}} through print media; magazines and books. The reader would type the BASIC program listing {{into the computer}} by hand, run it, and could save it to tape for <b>later</b> <b>use.</b> Software distributed in this way was in general simpler and slower than its assembly language counterparts. Magazines printed long lists of checksummed hexadecimal digits with machine code games or tools.|$|E
5|$|The {{algorithm}} {{accepts a}} 32-bit floating-point number as the input and stores a halved value for <b>later</b> <b>use.</b> Then, treating the bits representing the floating-point number as a 32-bit integer, a logical shift right by one bit is performed {{and the result}} subtracted from the magic number 0x5F3759DF. This is the first approximation of the inverse square root of the input. Treating the bits again as a floating-point number, it runs one iteration of Newton's method, yielding a more precise approximation.|$|E

5|$|While {{playing in}} the minors, Crozier adopted the {{butterfly}} style of goaltending, which he would <b>later</b> <b>use</b> during his NHL career. This technique was popularized by Glenn Hall and was improved upon by Crozier. Initially, his minor league coaches tried to convince him to abandon this style, thinking {{that it would never}} succeed in the NHL. Crozier also added an element of acrobacy in his game.|$|E
5|$|After the {{supporters}} of Henry III of England suppressed opposition from the English nobility in the Second Barons' War, Henry granted to his second son Edmund Crouchback the titles and possessions forfeited by attainder of the barons' leader, Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, including the Earldom of Leicester, on 26 October 1265. Later grants included the first Earldom of Lancaster on 30 June 1267 and that of Earl Ferrers in 1301. Edmund was also Count of Champagne and Brie from 1276 by right of his wife. Henry IV of England would <b>later</b> <b>use</b> his descent from Edmund to legitimise his claim to the throne, even making the spurious claim that Edmund was the elder son of Henry but had been passed over as king because of his deformity.|$|E
5|$|After {{their work}} with Black Uhuru and that group's line-up change, Sly and Robbie pursued more {{international}} music endeavors. They branched out into cross-genre experiments with a conceptual, ensemble-oriented approach, while developing a mentorship with record producer Bill Laswell, whom they met through Blackwell and by working on Mick Jagger's 1985 album She's the Boss. In 1985, they collaborated with Laswell on their album Language Barrier, which had guest contributions from Herbie Hancock, Bob Dylan, Afrika Bambaataa, and Manu DiBango. Its recording developed from a track the duo had revisited from their work on the soundtrack to the 1983 film Never Say Never Again. The track had been done with electronic drums at Compass Point Studios, but scrapped as a rhythm track for <b>later</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E

5|$|Balzac {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the novel during a trip to Brittany arranged by a family friend in 1828. Intrigued by the people and atmosphere of the region, he began collecting notes and descriptions for <b>later</b> <b>use.</b> After publishing an Avertissement for the novel, he released three editions – each of them revised significantly. The first novel Balzac published without a pseudonym, he used many titles as he wrote and published, including Le Gars, Les Chouans ou la Bretagne il y a trente ans, and Le Dernier Chouan ou la Bretagne en 1800.|$|E
5|$|Clock Tower is a {{survival}} horror point-and-click adventure game with 2D graphics. The player controls a cursor {{to direct the}} main character, Jennifer Simpson, and give commands such as investigating objects or opening doors. Jennifer can walk and run, although running will reduce her stamina, in which case she may recover her stamina by sitting on the floor. Jennifer's character portrait {{in the corner of}} the screen will change depending on her stamina level. In addition to interacting with objects in the game, Jennifer can also store them as inventory for <b>later</b> <b>use.</b> The layout of items changes with each play-through.|$|E
5|$|Farming in Egypt was {{dependent}} on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons: Akhet (flooding), Peret (planting), and Shemu (harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing on the river's banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded, the growing season lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields, which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops. From March to May, farmers used sickles to harvest their crops, which were then threshed with a flail to separate the straw from the grain. Winnowing removed the chaff from the grain, and the grain was then ground into flour, brewed to make beer, or stored for <b>later</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E

5|$|Henry's {{only means}} of {{communication}} is a walkie-talkie connecting him to his supervisor, Delilah. Players may choose {{from a number of}} dialog options to speak with her upon the discovery of new interactive objects or environments, or can refrain from communicating. The player's choices will influence the tone of Henry's relationship with Delilah. As the story progresses, new areas will be opened up for players. The game also features a day-night cycle. Objects found in the wilderness can be kept in the inventory for <b>later</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
5|$|High {{levels of}} both {{sugar and salt}} can {{preserve}} food by preventing micro-organisms from growing. Green beans can be salted by layering the pods with salt, but this method of preservation is unsuited to most vegetables. Marrows, beetroot, carrot, and some other vegetables can be boiled with sugar to create jams. Vinegar is widely used in food preservation; a sufficient concentration of acetic acid prevents the development of destructive micro-organisms, a fact made use of {{in the preparation of}} pickles, chutneys and relishes. Fermentation is another method of preserving vegetables for <b>later</b> <b>use.</b> Sauerkraut is made from chopped cabbage and relies on lactic acid bacteria which produce compounds that are inhibitory to the growth of other micro-organisms.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius deterrimus is an edible mushroom, but is {{much less}} {{appreciated}} than the similar L.deliciosus. The first tastes slightly bitter and is often infested by maggots. Like L.deliciosus, this fungus is mainly stir-fried in butter or oil; if it is cooked in water, the flesh becomes very soft. Young fruit bodies can be also pickled, or dried for <b>later</b> <b>use.</b> As the fungus is often heavily infested by maggots, skilled mushroom pickers prefer young fruit bodies. The urine discolours to red if {{a large amount of}} milk caps are eaten, but this is entirely harmless and is not evidence for an impairment to health. The red-coloured azulene compounds, ingested with the mushroom food, are more or less excreted with the urine.|$|E

5|$|Severe {{childhood}} {{trauma is}} {{also associated with}} a general increase {{in the risk of}} drug dependency. Lack of peer and family support is associated with an increased risk of alcoholism developing. Genetics and adolescence are associated with an increased sensitivity to the neurotoxic effects of chronic alcohol abuse. Cortical degeneration due to the neurotoxic effects increases impulsive behaviour, which may contribute to the development, persistence and severity of alcohol use disorders. There is evidence that with abstinence, there is a reversal of {{at least some of the}} alcohol induced central nervous system damage. The use of cannabis was associated with later problems with alcohol use. Alcohol use was associated with an increased probability of <b>later</b> <b>use</b> of tobacco, cannabis, and other illegal drugs.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen {{consists}} of ten segments and contains the gut and genital organs. The front eight segments have spiracles and the terminal segment is modified for reproduction. The male has {{a pair of}} clasping organs attached to a ring structure, and during copulation, a tubular structure is extruded and inserted into the female's vagina. A spermatophore is deposited in the female, following which the sperm {{make their way to}} a seminal receptacle where they are stored for <b>later</b> <b>use.</b> In both sexes, the genitalia are adorned with various spines, teeth, scales and bristles, which act to prevent the butterfly from mating with an insect of another species. After it emerges from its pupal stage, a butterfly cannot fly until the wings are unfolded. A newly emerged butterfly needs to spend some time inflating its wings with hemolymph and letting them dry, during which time it is extremely vulnerable to predators.|$|E
5|$|The main plant foods {{gathered}} were walnuts, saguaro fruits, juniper berries, acorns, sunflower seeds, manzanita {{berries and}} apples, hackberries, the bulbs of the Quamash, and the greens of the Lamb's quarters, Scrophularia, and Lupinus plants. Agave {{was the most}} crucial harvest, {{as it was the}} only plant food available from late fall through early spring. The hearts of the plant were roasted in stone-lined pits, and could be stored for <b>later</b> <b>use.</b> Primary animals hunted were deer, rabbit, jackrabbit, quail, and woodrat. Fish and water-borne birds were eschewed by most Yavapai groups. Some groups of Tolkepaya began eating fish after contact with their Quechan neighbors.|$|E
