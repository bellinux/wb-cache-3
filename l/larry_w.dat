2500|$|The term proto-orthodox Christianity, {{coined by}} New Testament scholar Bart D. Ehrman, {{describes}} the Early Christian movement {{which was the}} precursor of Christian orthodoxy. Ehrman argues that this group, which became prominent {{by the end of}} the 3rd century, [...] "stifled its opposition, it claimed that its views had always been the majority position and that its rivals were, and always had been, ‘heretics,’ who willfully ‘chose’ to reject the ‘true belief’." [...] (Critics such as <b>Larry</b> <b>W.</b> Hurtado argue for the traditional view that proto-orthodox Christianity arose directly from the immediate followers of Jesus.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Stamatios [...] "Tom" [...] Krimigis, {{head of the}} Applied Physics Laboratory's space division, one of many {{entrants}} in the New Frontiers Program competition, {{formed the}} New Horizons team with Alan Stern in December 2000. [...] Appointed as the project's principal investigator, Stern was described by Krimigis as [...] "the personification of the Pluto mission". New Horizons was based largely on Stern's work since Pluto 350 and involved most of the team from Pluto Kuiper Express. The New Horizons proposal was one of five that were officially submitted to NASA. It was later selected as one of two finalists {{to be subject to}} a three-month concept study, in June 2001. The other finalist, POSSE (Pluto and Outer Solar System Explorer), was a separate, but similar Pluto mission concept by the University of Colorado Boulder, led by principal investigator <b>Larry</b> <b>W.</b> Esposito, and supported by the JPL, Lockheed Martin and the University of California. However, the APL, in addition to being supported by Pluto Kuiper Express developers at the Goddard Space Flight Center and Stanford University, were at an advantage; they had recently developed NEAR Shoemaker for NASA, which had successfully entered orbit around 433 Eros earlier in the year, and would later land on the asteroid to scientific and engineering fanfare.|$|E
2500|$|... 52 is small, and {{although}} a plausible reconstruction can be attempted {{for most of}} the fourteen lines represented, the proportion of the text of the Gospel of John for which it provides a direct witness is necessarily limited, so it is rarely cited in textual debate. There has, however, been some contention as to whether the name ΙΗΣΟΥ (Jesus) in the 'missing' portions of recto lines 2 and 5 was originally written as nomen sacrum; in other words, was it contracted to ΙΣ or ΙΗΣ in accordance with otherwise universal Christian practice in surviving early Gospel manuscripts. Roberts originally considered that the divine name was {{more likely to have been}} written in full, but later changed his mind. This latter is also the view of <b>Larry</b> <b>W.</b> Hurtado; with C. M. Tuckett maintaining Roberts' original opinion. The verses included in 52 are also witnessed in Bodmer Papyrus 66 [...] usually dated to the beginning of the 3rd century CE [...] there is also some overlap with 60 and 90 of the 7th and 2nd centuries respectively. No two of the four contain the same exact text as reconstructed for John 18:31-38, but 52 seems to represent an example of the same proto-Alexandrian text-type. Aland described it as a [...] "Normal text", and placed it in Category I (because of its age).|$|E
