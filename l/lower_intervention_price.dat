These measures imply a further shift from price to income support, by <b>lowering</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>prices</b> for cereals, beef and milk, and {{by increasing the}} level and scope of acreage and headage premiums so as to compensate for income losses. However, the impact on farm incomes is negative. Acreage and headage premiums increase and become the dominant item on the agricultural budget of the EU.

The Common Market Organization for Sugar sets an <b>intervention</b> <b>price</b> of € 63. 19 but actual transaction pries are 10 - 20 percent higher.

40|$|At the Copenhagen European Council Meeting in December 2002 the European Union (EU) {{decided to}} enlarge the EU with ten new member states. In this study {{the impact of the}} {{accession}} for each of the EU- 25 member states is analysed. In particular, results of the accession under different policy environments, including the impacts of the recently adopted reform af the Common Agricultural Policy, are presented. The analysis shows that agricultural supply responses will be very different across acceding countries and that the impact of decoupling direct support is significant. The supply response in the new member states will be significantly smaller in the grain sector, when direct support is decoupled. In the old EU member countries, decoupling of animal premiums will lead to a 7 to 10 per cent decline in the production of beef in the EU- 15 and that the <b>lowering</b> of <b>intervention</b> <b>prices</b> in the dairy sector will imply that milk quotas, in some member countries of the EU- 15, are no longer binding.

50|$|Monetary {{compensatory}} amounts (MCAs) were border {{measures in the}} EU consisting of taxes and subsidies formerly applicable to intra-EC trade in agricultural and food products for which <b>intervention</b> <b>prices</b> were set.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} and evaluate published data on cost effectiveness of cholesterol <b>lowering</b> <b>interventions,</b> {{and how this}} information could be interpreted in a rational approach of cholesterol management in general practice. DESIGN: A systematic review of the literature. SETTING: No restriction on setting. MATERIALS: Papers reporting on the cost effectiveness or cost utility of prevention of (recurrent) coronary heart disease by reduction of hypercholesterolaemia in adults. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty nine studies, most cost effectiveness analyses, were included. In 24 studies drug interventions only were analysed. Costs of screening to target cholesterol <b>lowering</b> <b>interventions</b> to persons with hypercholesterolaemia were considered in nine studies. Adjustments of {{the efficacy of the}} intervention for community effectiveness were described in seven studies. In four studies life years gained were adjusted for quality of life. Despite large variation in the outcomes, there is a constant tendency towards a less favourable cost effectiveness ratio for intervening in persons without coronary heart disease compared with persons with coronary heart disease and for women compared with men. CONCLUSIONS: There is lack of data on cost effectiveness of cholesterol <b>lowering</b> <b>interventions</b> in the general practice setting. The cost effectiveness of cholesterol lowering in general practice deteriorates when all relevant costs are taken into account and when efficacy is corrected for community effectiveness. Cholesterol <b>lowering</b> <b>intervention</b> is more cost effective in men compared with women and in patients with coronary heart disease compared with persons without coronary heart disease. Considerations from cost effectiveness analyses should be incorporated into {{the development and implementation of}} national cholesterol guidelines for general practitioners.

40|$|The {{subsidies}} and protection {{structure of the}} sugar sectors in the European Union originated from the individual national protection systems, unified {{with the creation of}} the Common Agricultural Policy. The COM for Sugars is based on an <b>intervention</b> <b>price</b> quite higher than international prices. To determine who benefits from this <b>intervention</b> <b>price,</b> production quotas are established and distributed to each Member- State, producer and raw-material supplier. In parallel, levies are charged on sugar produced and tariffs on imported sugar, which contribute part of total funds required to finance these subsidies. The difference is covered by the community budget. The Eu imports sugar from ex- European colonies, paid at the internal EU price and benefitting from import tariff isention. Most of this sugar is reexported refined. There are other “entrances” for smaller quantities of sugar with preferential treatment, used, among others, by Cuba and Brazil. Subsidies and privileges are being contested internally and externally. Negotiations in international fora (WTO, bilateral talks) and preparation for the accession of East European countries to the EU will probably accelerate the reform of the COM for Sugar.

30|$|Progressive price {{reduction}} allows {{in the first}} place for a greater range of price variation. This does not determine VPT but establishes a preliminary condition for greater price movements. Assuming that internal competition in the sugar sector is mainly based on scale economies, reduced price support combined with reduced production quotas should theoretically promote cost-based competition among producers, leading toward an increased concentration. In this regard, it is worth remembering that price floor is not limited by the <b>intervention</b> <b>price,</b> and a reference price (which is not a guaranteed price) substituted it.|$|R
40|$|The Common Agricultural Policy has radically been {{reformed}} in 2003 {{with the}} introduction of “decoupled” direct payments. Economic theory suggests that direct payments are expected to have no impact on production in a static deterministic environment with perfect markets for capital and labour. But if factor market imperfections or uncertainty are taken into account, this is no longer true. Taking into account these potential impacts, the empirical literature has studied the impacts of farm payments. However, most studies are based on assumptions such as perfect markets, risk neutrality or static environment. Recent researches have also often neglected the role of debt constraints. The paper develops and numerically solves a dynamic stochastic farm household model with occasionally binding debt constraints and investment adjustment costs. The impacts of direct and counter-cyclical payments are explored and compared to an increase in the <b>intervention</b> <b>price.</b> Results show that both types of payments will positively impact on investment, but the impacts on output will not be as significant as it is with an increase in <b>intervention</b> <b>price.</b> Further, the degree of decoupling of Single Farm Payments in the French crops sector is found to be significantly linked to the degree of capital market imperfections.

40|$|Recent Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) {{reforms have}} {{affected}} dairy policy, including the milk quota system, {{and increased the}} market orientation of the sector. A modelling exercise, using the European Dairy Industry Model (EDIM), simulates an initial sharp decline in the EU milk price {{in response to the}} decrease in the <b>intervention</b> <b>prices</b> of butter and SMP after 2003, followed by a period of stability and an increase from 2007 / 08 as the demand for dairy protein products increases over time and EU milk supply is still restricted by quotas. The phasing out of the milk quota following the implementation of the 2009 Health Check is estimated to lead to an increase in milk production and a decrease in the milk price both within and without the European Union. The gap between EU domestic and border prices is expected to continue to narrow. Looking at developments in dairy markets between 2000 and 2007, the study finds that milk prices did not decrease as much as expected because the <b>intervention</b> <b>prices</b> were no longer binding, in particular for skimmed milk powder. The income of dairy farms increased as decline in milk prices was more than compensated by the introduction of dairy premium and higher farm productivity due to the increase in farm size. However, since 2007, incomes of dairy farmers have strongly fluctuated as both milk and feed prices have been highly variable in opposite directions...|$|R
