Local Exchange Trading Schemes (LETS) have begun to receive attention in policy circles as a potential tool for mitigating social exclusion. Prior to this project, the only evidence available concerning the role of LETS for tackling social exclusion were one-off evaluations of individual LETS. In order to evaluate whether this is possible this project provides the first comprehensive evaluation {{of the effectiveness of}} LETS in tackling social exclusion. The project, therefore, makes an important contribution to 'evidence-based policy-making'. This 'applied' aspect of the research, however, is but one of the major contributions of this project. The original project proposal emphasised our desire to use LETS as a laboratory to develop theory on value, exchange and money. This too has become increasingly important. The desire to rethink 'the economic' has gained considerable momentum {{over the past three years}} in academic discourse. As one of the first in-depth empirical investigations of the socially constructed meaning and nature of value, exchange and money, this research is set to make an important contribution to rethinking 'the economic'. Main Topics : This data set contains the results of two surveys. An initial survey of <b>Local</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Trading</b> <b>Scheme</b> (LETS) co-ordinators investigated (a) the origins, age, location and reasons for setting up each LETS; (b) its magnitude and growth in terms of membership and trading; (c) its organisational structure, and (d) the regulatory mechanisms used. This survey was followed up with another survey of LETS members in groups. The sampling technique adopted was based on maximum variation of geographical location, type of area i. e. urban, suburban or rural, size of membership and length of time group had been running. This provided data for each LETS on: the membership profile (e. g., gender, household income, employment history, educational qualifications, ethnicity); the level and nature of their activity on LETS; and perceptions of members of its impacts on their social, economic and financial exclusion...|$|E
40|$|<b>Local</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Trading</b> <b>Schemes</b> (LETS) {{are widely}} {{promoted}} {{as a new}} tool for local economic development, but until recently the {{focus has been on}} their alleged ‘potential’ rather than the realities of their operation. This paper assesses the practical economic role of LETS by examining the amount of trading conducted, and demonstrates that both the volume of trading and the value of the trades are very low. Drawing on an intensive case study of the first UK LETS created explicitly as part of a local authority’s anti-poverty strategy, explanations for the low levels of participation are suggested, and significant structural constraints on the development of LETS are identified...|$|R

We conclude by documenting these changes...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable {{consumption}} is gaining currency {{as a new}} environmental policy objective, {{but there is a}} limit to the changes in consumption behaviour which individuals can make within current socio-economic frameworks. The 'new economics' literature argues that sustainable {{consumption is}} characterised by five factors: localisation, reducing ecological footprints, community-building, collective action, and building new social institutions. These form a set of indicators for evaluation of initiatives and policies. Community currencies have been put forward as a new tool to promote sustainable consumption, but until now there has been no appraisal of their ability to deliver this goal. Three different community currency types are described and their effectiveness and potential in enabling more sustainable consumption patterns is assessed against this set of indicators. The currencies examined are: <b>Local</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Trading</b> <b>Schemes</b> (LETS) which aims to rebuild local economies through cashless exchange; Time Banks promote volunteering, civic engagement and mutual self-help by rewarding unpaid work in the community; and the previously unresearched NU-card, a 'green loyalty point' currency which incentivises sustainable consumption. The findings of this preliminary analysis indicate that while they all represent nascent social institutions based on different sets of values to the mainstream, each model of community currency successfully achieves some, but not all, of the criteria for sustainable consumption. However, the currencies are complementary and between them each of the indicators is met. The policy and research implications of the study are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Why did <b>Local</b> <b>Exchange</b> and <b>Trading</b> <b>Schemes</b> (LETS) fail {{to realise}} their promise in 1990 s Britain? This article {{argues that a}} core reason was the {{inability}} to make community labour, a concept {{at the heart of}} LETS logic, function as a self-perpetuating dynamic, in which community bonding would encourage trade and trade in turn would build community. In exploring reasons for this failure, the article focuses on the centrifugal pull of two contrasting temporalities: community time and labour-market time. And in understanding why these two, normative, temporal orders were unable to combine, cohere or simply to coexist, the article addresses three factors: failure in design; individual member responsibility; and wider temporal pressures...|$|R

40|$|Ecovillages, Timebanks and a <b>Local</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Trading</b> <b>Schemes</b> {{are part}} of global social {{movements}} as well as offering innovative approaches to local sustainability. The current study looks at these three community-economic initiatives {{as a means of}} addressing the connected social, economic and environmental challenges of local sustainable development. Investigating these collective practices builds on current approaches to studying pro-environmental behaviour change in the social sciences. Two research questions structured this investigation. These focussed on i) how members understand their experiences within the selected groups and ii) processes leading to the formation, maintenance and contraction of the initiatives. Five individuals were interviewed from each group and interviews were analysed using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis. Secondary data sources also contributed to a broad analysis of group processes and contexts. Diverging from traditional approaches, this multi-level, interdisciplinary account is able to capture more of the complex reality of these organisations than would be possible within a single discipline or through focussing on a single element of group membership. Indeed this comprehensive approach to studying community-based models for sustainability is the unique contribution of this study, moving forward methodological debates in this field. Findings that emerged from this study emphasise group members’ motivation to enhance their personal resilience. Participation provided members with a sense of agency and community connection, as well as being a means to express alternative cultural identities. Informal reciprocal exchange was also preferred to more formal exchange practices, with implications for the understanding and development of community exchange systems. This study widens the focus of environmental psychology to include socio-economic practices, and contributes towards the growing interdisciplinary field of complementary currencies and grassroots innovation. Finally, it provides a template for the evaluation of sustainable community-economic initiatives more generally. The thesis concludes that these initiatives and their wider movements are a promising avenue for research and development in sustainability...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{the policy}} {{community}} has been paying particular attention to <b>Local</b> <b>Exchange</b> and <b>Trading</b> <b>Schemes</b> (LETS) as potential bridges into work for the unemployed. Up until now, however, there has only been piecemeal evidence on whether LETS are effective in this regard. In this paper, therefore, the full results of the first comprehensive evaluation of LETS are reported. In order to feed into the 'evidence-based policy-making' process, we evaluate whether LETS are effective first, as bridges into employment, second, as bridges into self-employment and, third and finally, at building reciprocal exchange networks. Our finding is that although LETS provide an indirect bridge into employment by improving employability, they are most effective as seedbeds {{for the development of}} self-employed business ventures and as vehicles for facilitating exchange beyond employment. For LETS to become more effective bridges into work for a wider range of the unemployed, nevertheless, a number of barriers to participation need to be tackled. The paper concludes by outlining how this could be achieved...|$|R
40|$|We {{identify}} <b>local</b> <b>exchange</b> and <b>trading</b> <b>schemes</b> (LETS) as {{a social}} movement rooted in the alternative milieux of greens, feminists, new agers, and so on, comprising those committed to experimenting with new ideas and identities. LETS {{have the potential to}} strengthen these milieux and thereby reinforce civil society within a locality, enhancing the benefits from a web of personal networks and extending them through weak links. LETS might also act as seed beds for new skills and practices which spill over into wider social and economic networks. Thus, by promoting networks which facilitate flows of information and innovation, and thereby building the capacity for responding to social change, LETS could contribute to community economic development. LETS form part of a cultural rather than technological innovation milieu. Our fieldwork in Stroud, Bristol, and environs suggests that, given the typical member's preference to remain distanced from the state, it is likely that a hands-off approach would be most successful in realising the potential of LETS. To tie such schemes to specific policy goals would ignore the symbolic meanings attached to membership of them. ...|$|R
40|$|The Employment Research Institute at Napier University, Edinburgh, {{carried out}} a review of <b>Local</b> <b>Exchange</b> And <b>Trading</b> <b>Schemes</b> (LETS) in Scotland during February and March 2004.

The umbrella organisation, LETSLink Scotland, provided a list of 25 LETS in Scotland, of which 22 were interviewed. Of these, five were currently dissolved or dormant. A couple of schemes {{were in the process of}} start-up at the time the survey was carried out, while many had been in operation for a number of years (including four that had been trading for 10 or more years).

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{relationship}} between a particular social practice - <b>local</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>trading</b> systems or <b>schemes</b> (LETS) - and what we here call the "mainstream" marketing paradigm. It begins by discussing some of the key principles that are thought to set LETS apart from other, "more mainstream", economic activities. One case is then given particular attention - the "Ithaca hours" system - run in Ithaca, New York. Having examined the formalities of the system and its operation, the paper reviews what participants say about their participation. The paper draws upon these multiple narratives to explore the ways LETS may be both similar to and different from other forms of economic and social praxis. The authors' argument is that "mainstream" marketing concepts and practices fail to embrace all the complexities of LETS as social-economic practices. ...|$|R

The internal coherence of the systems and the relevance of the 'local' is assessed.

30|$|In this study, five GETFs were considered: SBI Gold <b>Exchange</b> <b>Traded</b> <b>Scheme,</b> UTI GETF, Kotak GETF, R*Shares GETF, Goldman Sachs Gold <b>Exchange</b> <b>Traded</b> <b>Scheme.</b> The daily {{returns of}} GETFs {{over the period}} 2010 to 2015 were used. These GETFs have been floated and traded on the Indian Stock Market (BSE) since the year when GETFs was first {{introduced}} in India (i.e., in 2007). The historic data on the GETFs of both banking and non-banking institutions were considered. The closing prices were available only from 22 / 03 / 2010 onwards; hence, the daily returns in the period from 22 / 03 / 2010 to 28 / 08 / 2015 were used. The returns, calculated as differences in the log price, were {{used to examine the}} efficiency of the market. If the returns based on the GETF prices followed a random walk, it could be concluded that the Indian GETF market was informationally efficient in the weak form. The daily returns were analyzed for randomness using both non-parametric and parametric tests. Even if parametric tests are available, both types of tests are employed in this paper.|$|R
