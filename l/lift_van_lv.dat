40|$|Chapter 1 {{is a brief}} {{introduction}} to several aspects of cardiovascular pressure-volume relations in dialysis patients. The aims of the thesis are presented. In Chapter 2, an overview is presented of circulatory physiology in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Volume withdrawal by ultrafiltration during HD may lead to intravascular hypovolemia and intradialytic hypotension. Hemodynamic defense mechanisms are discussed, focusing on left ventricular (LV) function. The concept of load, which reflects {{the interaction between the}} heart and the vascular system, is explained. Chronic pressure and volume overload account for a high prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in dialysis patients. LVH may lead to LV dysfunction, which may eventually become manifest as heart failure. In dialysis patients, however, elevated cardiac filling pressures may reflect volume overload before HD rather than heart failure, and loading conditions are altered by volume witdrawal during HD. The cyclic changes in volume status hamper the assessment of LV function in HD patients. Current LV systolic and diastolic function measurements in clinical practice are reviewed. The load dependence of these measurements is discussed. Finally, future perspectives for load-independent assessment of LV function and measurement of pressure-volume relations in clinical dialysis practice are suggested. The cyclic changes in volume status and recurring cardiovascular strains of the HD procedure may lead to chronic myocardial damage, especially in patients with LVH or myocardial fibrosis. In these conditions, a decreased myocardial capillary density and reduction in myocardial flow reserve may lead to a reduced myocardial perfusion pressure during HD or volume overload before HD. In Chapter 3, we observed a high incidence of elevated cardiac troponin T (cTnT) measured in our entire dialysis population before a HD session. Although none of the patients had evidence of acute ischemic myocardial injury, baseline cTnT was elevated in 82 %. The incidence of elevated cTnT was higher in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. During a two-year follow-up period, patients with an elevated cTnT also had a higher mortality rate. In a subgroup, cTnT was measured during the HD procedure and no change in cTnT levels was found. We concluded that elevated cTnT levels in asymptomatic dialysis patients are of prognostic value. They are not caused by acute myocardial injury or by HD itself, but may be related to chronic myocardial damage or decreased clearance of cTnT degradation fragments. However, in dialysis patients who had an acute coronary syndrome during the follow-up period, cTnT increased above baseline, and tended to return to baseline after recovery. Therefore, a cTnT rise in dialysis patients above the individual baseline does appear to be diagnostic of acute myocardial injury. LV diastolic dysfunction is believed to be common in dialysis patients, especially in patients with LVH. However, as conventional echo Doppler parameters are load-dependent, predialysis hypervolemia may lead to pseudonormalization, and thereby mask diastolic dysfunction. In Chapter 4, we introduced new Doppler parameters of LV diastolic function. Mitral annulus velocity by Doppler tissue imaging (DTI) and LV inflow propagation velocity from color M-mode were measured before and after HD. Using these new echo Doppler techniques, which have been proposed as relatively preload-independent measurements of diastolic function, we demonstrated diastolic dysfunction in this study population. Unexpectedly, these techniques exhibited a pattern of load dependence similar to that displayed by the conventional Doppler measurements. So even when using the newer Doppler techniques, the degree of diastolic dysfunction was underestimated as a result of pseudonormalization due to volume overload. Therefore, the advantage of these techniques over conventional parameters for the assessment of LV diastolic function in dialysis patients is limited. Alternatively, DTI may reflect the actual diastolic function, which would imply that HD impaired cardiac relaxation and thereby worsened LV diastolic function. This could have been caused by the increase in serum ionized calcium concentration during HD. To further unravel the effects of changes in volume and in serum ionized calcium, we tested the effect of HD without ultrafiltration on these measurements, as was described in Chapter 5. Transmitral flow and mitral annulus velocities were measured before and after 1 hour of HD without ultrafiltration. The use of a standard 1. 75 mmol/L dialysate Ca 2 + concentration resulted in a significant increase in serum ionized calcium after one hour. Despite this increase, there was no change in transmitral flow and tissue Doppler velocities. This confirms the conclusion of the previous chapter, i. e. that the change in both transmitral Doppler and DTI results from changes in preload. Chronic pressure overload results from increased arterial stiffness, which becomes clinically manifest as systolic hypertension with an increased pulse pressure. A reduced aortic compliance signifies an increased cardiac pulsatile load, which promotes the development of LVH. In Chapter 6, a pulse pressure method is introduced, which is based on the Windkessel model, and can be used to estimate aortic compliance non-invasively. This technique, which combines carotid pulse contour analysis by applanation tonometry with aortic outflow volume measurements by Doppler echocardiography, has not been applied before in a dialysis population. We tested whether a reduction in volume overload by ultrafiltration during HD leads to an improvement of aortic compliance. After volume withdrawal, we observed a concomitant decrease in arterial pressure and a small improvement in aortic compliance. We concluded that the increase in aortic stiffness in dialysis patients is partly caused by a reversible reduction of aortic compliance due to volume expansion. Volume withdrawal by HD moves the arterial wall characteristics back to a more favorable position on the non-linear pressure-volume curve. LV systolic dysfunction is thought to contribute to an increased frequency of intradialytic hypotension. However, accurate measurement of LV function in dialysis patients is hampered by the load dependence of commonly used parameters, such as the LV ejection fraction (EF). The end-systolic pressure-volume relationship, or end-systolic elastance (Ees), represents the mechanical properties of a fully contracted ventricle. This inherent characteristic of a given LV is a parameter of LV systolic function which is almost insensitive to load. Ees was estimated non-invasively in hypotension-prone and hypotension-resistant dialysis patients from the acute LV response to preload reduction by nitroglycerine, as described in Chapter 7. EF, LV area and finger arterial pressure (Finapres) were recorded continuously before HD. Finapres and LV area data were combined to create pressure-area loops following intravenous nitroglycerine. Hypotension-prone and hypotension-resistant dialysis patients had similar Ees. Thus, it seems doubtful whether LV systolic function {{plays an important role in}} the genesis of intradialytic hypotension. Ees in both groups was low compared to Ees from pressure-area loops in non-uremic patients undergoing cardiac surgery. As EF before dialysis indicated normal systolic function, LV systolic dysfunction in dialysis patients is masked by the load dependence of conventional measurements. The measurement of LV pressure-volume relations yields valuable information on how the LV is coupled to the vascular system. This knowledge is essential in identifying dialysis patients with LV dysfunction. With this information, dialysis patients with heart failure can be distinguished from dialysis patients with excessive volume overload before HD, in whom lowering dry weight might suffice. Identification of dialysis patients with LV dysfunction at an earlier stage, i. e. before heart failure becomes clinically manifest, not only helps secondary prevention, but also provides a tool for measuring the results of treatment and intervention trials. Clinically applicable, load-independent measurement of LV function, therefore, could help improve the quality of life and management of our dialysis patients. Hoofdstuk 1 is een korte inleiding waarin verschillende aspecten van cardiovasculaire druk-volumerelaties in hemodialysepatiënten en de doelstellingen van het proefschrift worden gepresenteerd. In Hoofdstuk 2 wordt een overzicht gepresenteerd van de fysiologie van de circulatie in hemodialysepatiënten. Het onttrekken van volume door middel van ultrafiltratie tijdens hemodialyse kan leiden tot intravasculaire ondervulling en intradialytische hypotensie. Hemodynamische verdedigingsmechanismen worden besproken, waarbij de nadruk ligt op de functie van de linker ventrikel (<b>LV)</b> <b>van</b> het hart. Het begrip load, waarmee de interactie tussen het hart en het vaatstelsel wordt weergegeven, wordt uitgelegd. Chronische druk- en volumeoverbelasting zijn verantwoordelijk voor een hoge prevalentie van linkerventrikelhypertrofie (LVH) in dialysepatiënten. LVH kan leiden tot LV dysfunctie, hetgeen manifest kan worden als hartfalen. In dialysepatiënten kan een verhoogde cardiale vullingsdruk echter een uiting zijn van hypervolemie voorafgaande aan de hemodialyse in plaats van hartfalen.

30|$|The {{spectral}} clustering (SC) {{algorithm is}} {{a new type of}} clustering algorithm based on graph theory. It can be applied to data sets with any distribution shape and is independent of the dimension of the data; the global optimal solution can be obtained using the standard linear algebra method by a clustering criterion in a relaxed continuous domain through the eigen decomposition of the similarity matrix (Von Luxburg 2007). SC is a focus research of the clustering analysis method (Alzate and Suykends 2012; Fujiwara et al. 2012; Mirkin and Nascimento 2012; Tasdemir 2012; Frederix and <b>Van</b> Barel 2013; <b>Lv</b> and Feng 2013). However, it still has some deficiencies, such as (1) the clustering results are sensitive to the initial clustering centers; (2) the algorithm is sensitive to the scale parameter (σ) and (3) the clustering number (k) needs to be set in advance. For the first one, Liu et al. (2012) proposed a method based on fuzzy K-harmonic means which could reduce the sensitivity to the initial centers to a certain extent; however, the local optimal value cannot be solved completely as the algorithm still uses the iterative optimization technique which is similar to the K-mean method. For the second one, the clustering ensemble-based methods (Zhang et al. 2008; Vega-Pons and Ruiz-Shulcloper 2011) are used to solve the problem that the clustering results rely on precise choice of the scale parameters, which uses different scale parameters in a given interval to obtain different clustering results and then merges them by an integrated approach. For the third one, the clustering validity index is used to evaluate the clustering results, of which the maximum value or the minimum value is taken when a most suitable cluster number is obtained (Bezdek and Pal 1998; Breaban and Luchian 2011; Saha and Bandyopadhyay 2012); however, this method also has some deficiencies (Wang et al. 2012), such as (1) exhaustive search of each k may bring huge computational cost and (2) for each k, the global optimal solution of the clustering results cannot be guaranteed.|$|R
5000|$|High Tops- These vans have {{a portion}} of the {{original}} factory roof cut away and a fiberglass [...] "high top" [...] or [...] "elk roof" [...] or [...] "high-raised roof" [...] added. This has become the signature feature of a conversion van. A high top allows occupants to stand in the van without bending over. For structural purposes, a section of the roof is often left at the front and back of the van. Modern vans, which have heavier frames, use less roof section than older vans. These fore and aft sections often have lights, storage shelves, stereo components, and, on older models, TVs and VCRs, much of which sits on the original roof section. The high top is a signature inclusion on disability vans because a wheelchair occupant can be <b>lifted</b> into the <b>van</b> without ducking. It has also become a requirement on campervans. The high top also allows for vastly more storage. Also, the early TVs and VCRs could be mounted in the ceiling, so they did not inhibit movement and leg room in the van. The first high tops started not much higher than the factory roof, then raised aft of the driver's seat with two skylights mounted in this section, typically flanking a TV antenna. This soon fell out of favor due to leaking and light hitting the occupants. High tops began to rise at a gentle angle with a steeply raked center spine section. The center section housed an internally mounted antenna and allowed for larger 13" [...] TVs. With the advent of flat panel TVs and small DVD players replacing VCRs, the need for high tops has been reduced. However, the increased space is highly desired by customers, especially since conversion vans have moved toward the luxury end of the automotive spectrum, and the majority of conversion vans are still produced with a high top.|$|R
40|$|The {{vibration}} isolation efficiency of seating has been evaluated in 100 work vehicles in 14 categories (cars, <b>vans,</b> <b>lift</b> trucks, lorries, tractors, buses, dumpers, excavators, helicopters, armoured vehicles, mobile cranes, grass rollers, mowers and milk floats). Seat isolation efficiency, {{expressed by the}} SEAT value, was determined for all seats (67 conventional seats and 33 suspension seats) from the vertical acceleration measured on the floors and on the seats of the vehicles. For most categories of vehicle, the average SEAT value was less than 100 %, indicating that the average seat provided some attenuation of vibration. However, there were large variations in SEAT values between vehicles within categories. Two alternative vibration frequency weightings (Wb from BS 6841, 1987; Wk from ISO 2631, 1997) yielded SEAT values that differed by less than 6 %. Overall, the SEAT values determined by two alternative methods (the ratio of r. m. s. values and the ratio of vibration dose values) differed by less than 4 · 5 % when using weighting Wb, although larger differences may be expected in some situations. The median SEAT value for the suspension seats was 84 · 6 %; the median SEAT value for the conventional seats was 86 · 9 % (based on weighting Wb and the ratio of r. m. s. values). Predicted SEAT values were obtained assuming that each seat could be interchanged between vehicles without altering its transmissibility. The calculations suggest that 94 % of the vehicles investigated might benefit from changing the current seat to a seat {{from one of the}} other vehicles investigated. Although the predictions are based on assumptions that will not always apply, it is concluded that the severity of whole-body vibration exposures in many work environments can be lessened by improvements to seating dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Background: Several {{footwear}} design {{characteristics are}} known to have detrimental effects on the foot. However, one characteristic that has received relatively little attention is the point where the sole flexes in the sagittal plane. Several footwear assessment forms assume that this should ideally be located directly under the metarsophalangeal joints (MTPJs), but this has not been directly evaluated. The aim of this study was therefore to assess the influence on plantar loading of different locations of the shoe sole flexion point. Method: Twenty-one asymptomatic females with normal foot posture participated. Standardised shoes were incised directly underneath the metatarsophalangeal joints, proximal to the MTPJs or underneath the midfoot. The participants walked in a randomised sequence of the three shoes whilst plantar loading patterns were obtained using the Pedar® in-shoe pressure measurement system. The foot was divided into nine anatomically important masks, and peak pressure (PP), contact time (CT) and pressure time integral (PTI) were determined. A ratio of PP and PTI between MTPJ 2 - 3 /MTPJ 1 was also calculated. Results: Wearing the shoe with the sole flexion point located proximal to the MTPJs resulted in increased PP under MTPJ 4 - 5 (6. 2 %) and decreased PP under the medial midfoot compared to the sub-MTPJ flexion point (- 8. 4 %). Wearing the shoe with the sole flexion point located under the midfoot resulted in decreased PP, CT and PTI in the medial and lateral hindfoot (PP: - 4. 2 % and - 5. 1 %, CT: - 3. 4 % and - 6. 6 %, PTI: - 6. 9 % and - 5. 7 %) and medial midfoot (PP: - 5. 9 % CT: - 2. 9 % PTI: - 12. 2 %) compared to the other two shoes. Conclusion: The findings {{of this study indicate that}} the location of the sole flexion point of the shoe influences plantar loading patterns during gait. Specifically, shoes with a sole flexion point located under the midfoot significantly decrease the magnitude and duration of loading under the midfoot and hindfoot, which may be indicative of an earlier heel <b>lift.</b> © 2014 <b>van</b> der Zwaard et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{its high}} stability, the purely {{two-dimensional}} allotrope of carbon, graphene, is perfectly suited {{to be used}} in nano electromechanical systems. This thesis presents measurements performed by Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), a surface science technique, which is able to measure the lattice structure as well as the local density of states (LDOS) with atomic resolution. It is shown, that graphene on SiO_ 2 can be significantly <b>lifted</b> through the <b>van</b> der Waals forces of an STM tip. This leads to a small Gaussian bump of width b= 5 - 7 Å and height up to A= 2. 5 Å below the tip. Such mechanical deformations of the graphene lattice can be elegantly described by a vector potential A_ps proportional to the strain, which induces a pseudomagnetic field B_ps = ∇× A_ps. This field appears with opposite sign on the two valleys of graphene, due to the time reversal symmetry of the strain. Additionally, B_ps induces an alignment of the pseudospin similar to the Zeeman coupling of real spins to a magnetic field. The Gaussian deformation generated by the STM tip exhibits a sixfold symmetric B_ps pattern with fields up to 4000 T, which causes a strong pseudospin-polarizations up to 35 %. Since the pseudospin in graphene is the sublattice, this polarization is directly visible in STM images as a sublattice symmetry breaking. The relation between measured A and observed SSB contrast C is quantitatively reproduced by an analytic strain model using the form of the Gaussian as obtained by molecular dynamics simulations. Other models explaining the observed C(A) relation are calculated, but fail by large margins. Additionally, freely suspended graphene, is probed by STM, showing a periodic rippling with current I dependent wavelength λ_PR= 13 - 40 nm for I= 500 - 100 pA, resembling the hexagonal shape of the atomic lattice of graphene. First steps towards an understanding of this surprising effect, did not adequately apply to the experimental data yet. Finally, a software was developed, which determines atom positions in STM images with an accuracy < 10 pm. Furthermore atomic strain maps can be generated by systematically correcting imaging artifacts, which allows the use of multiple images of the same area to substantially increase the accuracy. First results on crystalline graphite yield an accuracy of 0. 8 % of the lattice constant, which should be correlated to well established strain measurements, e. g. Raman spectroscopy, in the future...|$|R
