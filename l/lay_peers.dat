40|$|OBJECTIVE: Counselling {{has been}} {{identified}} as a promising strategy to reduce stigma. <b>Lay</b> and <b>peer</b> counsellors have provided counselling in various fields, but this has not yet been studied in the field of leprosy. The Stigma Assessment and Reduction of Impact (SARI) project in Cirebon District, Indonesia took up this endeavour. This paper describes the initial experiences based on the perspectives of the <b>lay</b> and <b>peer</b> counsellors and aims to provide lessons learnt for future initiatives. METHODS: The selection of <b>lay</b> and <b>peer</b> counsellors was based upon pre-defined criteria such as completed junior high school and level of confidence. This study draws on the notes of seven monitoring and evaluation meetings and 21 group discussions the main researcher facilitated with the <b>lay</b> and <b>peer</b> counsellors and the notes written by the <b>lay</b> and <b>peer</b> counsellors on the sessions with their clients. RESULTS: In total, 198 people affected by leprosy were offered counselling by the 11 <b>lay</b> and 12 <b>peer</b> counsellors; 145 accepted this offer. The other 53 either did not need counselling or did not want to participate for example due to worries about disclosure. Effective communication skills such as listening and asking effective questions were important, but also difficult to acquire for the <b>lay</b> and <b>peer</b> counsellors. Sharing personal experiences was highly appreciated by clients and stimulated a deepened reflection. CONCLUSION: Challenges related to concealment and effective skills exist, but some people affected by leprosy and others can become effective counsellors making it at the outset a challenging but nevertheless promising intervention...|$|R

5000|$|At first, {{all members}} of the House of Lords could hear appeals. The role of lay members of the House in {{judicial}} sittings began to fade in the nineteenth century. Soon, only [...] "Law Lords" [...] - the Lord Chancellor and Lords who held judicial office - came to hear appeals. The last time that lay members of the House actually voted on a case was in 1834. The Lords later came close to breaching this convention a decade later, when the House was considering the case of Daniel O'Connell, an Irish politician. A panel of Law Lords - the Lord Chancellor, three former Lord Chancellors, a former Lord Chancellor of Ireland and a former Lord Chief Justice - opined on the matter. Immediately thereafter, lay members began to make speeches about the controversial case. The Lord President of the Privy Council then advised that lay members should not intervene after the Law Lords had announced their opinions.

5000|$|In the ancien Régime peerage, {{a similar}} {{procedure}} was possible : {{the resignation of}} peerage. Any <b>lay</b> <b>peer</b> - all of them dukes -could resign his peerage to his heir, thus allowing the heir to enjoy all privileges of peerage, such as presence in Parliament. The eldest peer was almost always granted a brevet allowing him to keep the honors and precedence of the resigned peerage. In many cases, the procedure of resignation was only used to grant heirs, often {{around the time of}} their wedding, new titles : as both men had now the honors of a duke but only one similarly named dukedom could exist at any time, one of the two took a new title (such as duc de Chaulnes and duc de Picquigny, or duc de Saint-Simon and duc de Ruffec). This procedure was different from the use of a courtesy title by the eldest son of a peer holding multiple dukedoms (such as the duc de Luynes, also duc de Chevreuse). From 1755, the royal authorization for these resignations was not longer granted the king chose instead to grant brevets of precedence to the heirs rather than to their fathers after resignation. The first one of these brevet dukes was Louis-Léon de Brancas, eldest son of the Duke of Villars, brevetted Duke of Lauragais in 1755.|$|R
5000|$|Parliament {{was summoned}} in 1559 to {{consider}} a Reformation Bill and to recreate an independent Church of England. The drafted Reformation Bill defined Holy Communion in terms of Reformed Protestant theology, {{as opposed to the}} transubstantiation of the Roman Catholic mass, included abuse of the Pope in the litany, and ordered that ministers should wear the surplice only and not other Roman Catholic vestments. It allowed priests to marry, banned images from churches, and confirmed Elizabeth as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. The Bill met heavy resistance in the House of Lords, as Roman Catholic bishops and <b>lay</b> <b>peers</b> opposed and voted against it. They reworked much of the Bill, changed the proposed liturgy to allow for belief in the Real Presence of Christ in the Holy Communion, made allowance for the wearing of liturgical vestments, the celebration of the Communion in the customary place (altar or table against the east wall), and refused to grant Elizabeth the title of Supreme Head of the Church. Parliament was prorogued over Easter, and when it resumed, the government entered two new bills into the Houses—the Act of Supremacy and the Act of Uniformity. The Black Rubric of 1552 was repealed at the express order of the Queen. It permitted kneeling to receive communion out of reverence and not to imply the [...] "real and essential" [...] presence. Henceforth kneeling was customary and Real Presence implied without defining it with a doctrine such as transubstantiation. In 1662 the Rubric was restored but the words were changed to [...] "corporal" [...] to exclude the meaning that Christ was present physically in flesh and blood.|$|E

Kneeling again, {{the king was}} anointed in the palms of both hands by the Archbishop with the formula:Let these hands be anointed with holy oil, as kings and prophets have been anointed and as Samuel did anoint David to be king, that thou mayst be blessed and established as king over this people, whom the Lord, thy God, hath given thee to rule and govern, which he has vouchsafed to grant, who with the Father and the Holy Spirit, three in person and one in unity, be blessed and praised, now and for evermore.

Then the ring is blessed with the prayer [...] "Bless, O Lord, and sanctify this ring, etc." [...] and placed upon the king's hand with the original French formula, [...] "Receive the ring, etc." [...] and the prayer [...] "God to whom belongs all power, etc." [...] Then the scepter is placed into his right hand with the formula [...] "Receive the scepter, the sign of kingly power, etc." [...] and the prayer [...] "Lord, the fount of all good things, etc." [...] and the Hand of Justice {{in his left hand}} with the form [...] "Receive the Rod of virtue and equity, etc." [...] Then the peers were summoned by name to come near and assist. The Archbishop of Reims took the Crown of Charlemagne from the altar and says the forms [...] "God crown thee with a crown of glory, etc.", [...] "Receive this crown, etc." [...] (a conflation of the old French and the Roman forms) and the prayer, [...] "God of eternity, the Commander of all powers, etc." [...] set it on the king's head, while the other eleven peers touched it with their right hands.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the role of House of Lords as high court from the Restoration of 1660 {{to the passage of}} the Appellate Jurisdiction Act in 1876. Throughout this period, <b>lay</b> <b>peers</b> and bishops judged appeals on civil law from the central courts of England and Wales, Ireland (aside from between 1783 and 1800) and Scotland after the Union of 1707. It has long been known that the revolution of 1688 - 89 transformed the ability of parliament to pass legislation, but the increased length and predictability of parliamentary sessions was of equal significance to the judicial functions performed by peers. Unlike the English-dominated profile of eighteenth-century legislation, Scots constituted the largest proportion of appellants between 1740 and 1875. The lack of interaction between Westminster and Scotland is often seen as essential to ensuring the longevity of Union, but through comparing the subject matter of appeals and mapping the distribution of cases within Scotland, this article demonstrates the extent of Scottish engagement. Echoing the tendency of Scottish interests to pursue local, private and specific legislation in order to insulate Scottish institutions from English intervention, Scottish litigants primarily sought to maintain and challenge local privileges, legal particularisms and the power of dominant landowners.

METHODS: Two qualitative methods were used: face-to-face semi-structured individual interviews and focus groups. Interviews were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and coded thematically. Arabic-speaking migrants with Type 2 diabetes were recruited from several primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare settings in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. These settings were purposefully selected to obtain a diverse group of participants. Data collection continued until saturation was reached. This is the first study that involved members of Arabic-speaking communities in Australia in a formal process of consumer and public involvement to inform research design and recruitment in order to provide evidence for a new model of diabetes self-management for Arabic-speaking migrants. RESULTS: No self-management support was offered to Arabic-speaking migrants beyond the initial diagnosis period. Significant knowledge gaps and skills deficits in all self-management domains were evident. The provision of tailored self-management support was considered crucial. When asked about preferred structure and delivery modalities, a strong preference was reported for face-to-face storytelling interactions over telephone- or internet-based interventions. Gender-specific group education and self-management support sessions delivered by Arabic-speaking diabetes health professionals, <b>lay</b> <b>peers</b> or social workers trained in diabetes self-management were highly regarded. CONCLUSIONS: A patient and public involvement approach allows genuine engagement with Arabic-speaking migrants with diabetes.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore how informal (<b>lay</b> <b>peers</b> from churches) and formal (health care providers) health communication networks influence mammography screening use among older Samoan women. To do so, we apply diffusion of innovation theory and network analysis to understand how interpersonal networks may affect mammography use in this urban-dwelling, migrant population. The data come from a survey of 260 Samoan women, aged 50 years or older, who attended 39 randomly sampled Samoan churches in Los Angeles County (USA) between 1996 and 1997. Retrospective data, based over a 20 -year period from this sample's year of first use of mammography screening, suggest that interpersonal networks may have accounted for the dramatic increase in the rate of adoption within the past 5 years of the survey. Using this information, we categorized women into mutually exclusive stages of mammography use and regressed these stages of mammography use on formal (had a provider referral) and informal (level of connectedness with peers in churches) health communication networks. The results indicated that being well-connected within women's informal, church-based health communication networks increased the likelihood of being in the decision (planned to have) and implementation and confirmation (had a recent mammogram) stages, but having a provider referral for a mammogram (formal networks) only increased the likelihood of being in the latter stages compared to women in the knowledge and persuasion stages. Formal and informal health communication networks influence recent use of mammography screening, but informal networks, in and of themselves, are also influential on future intention to use mammography screening.

40|$|Background: This paper {{assesses the}} impact of a {{counselling}} intervention on reducing leprosy-related stigma in Cirebon District, Indonesia. The unique features of this intervention are its rights-based approach, the underlying Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) model, the three types of counselling and the <b>lay</b> and <b>peer</b> counsellors who were involved. Methodology/principal findings: Mixed methods (e. g. three scales, interviews, focus group discussions and reflection notes) were used to assess {{the impact of}} the intervention, which ran over a two-year period. There was a control area with no interventions. The study participants were people affected by leprosy and other key persons (e. g. family members). The sample size differs per method, for example, data regarding 67 counselling clients and 57 controls from a cohort, and notes from 207 counselling clients were examined. The notes showed that most clients faced stigma on a daily basis, whether internalized, anticipated and/or enacted. A significant reduction was found between the before and after total scores of the SARI Stigma Scale (p-value < 0. 001), Participation Scale Short (p-value < 0. 001) and WHO Quality of Life score (p-value < 0. 001) among the counselling clients. While there is also an effect in the control group, it is much larger in the intervention group. Qualitative data indicates that knowledge and rights trigger change. Clients took steps to improve their life such as re-connecting with neighbours, helping in household activities and applying for jobs. Challenges include the wish to conceal their condition. Conclusion/significance: The findings show that the counselling intervention was effective in reducing stigma, promoting the rights of people with leprosy and facilitating their social participation. More research is needed on how to create a more sustainable intervention, preferably structurally embedded in the health or social services...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Key populations (KPs) are disproportionally {{affected}} by HIV and have {{low rates of}} access to HIV testing and treatment services compared to the broader population. WHO promotes the use of differentiated approaches for reaching and recruiting KP into the HIV services continuum. These approaches may help increase access to KPs who are often criminalized or stigmatized. By catering to {{the specific needs of}} each KP individual, differentiated approaches may increase service acceptability, quality and coverage, reduce costs and support KP members in leading the HIV response among their communities. Discussion: WHO recommends the implementation of community-based and lay provider administered HIV testing services. Together, these approaches reduce barriers and costs associated with other testing strategies, allow greater ownership in HIV programmes for KP members and reach more people than do facility-based services. Despite this evidence availability and support for them is limited. Peer-driven interventions {{have been shown to be}} effective in engaging, recruiting and supporting clients. Some programmes employ HIV-positive or non-PLHIV “peer navigators” and other staff to provide case management, enrolment and/or re-enrolment in care and treatment services. However, a better understanding of the impact, cost effectiveness and potential burden on peer volunteers is required. Task shifting and non-facility-based service locations for antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation and maintenance and antiretroviral (ARV) distribution are recommended in both the consolidated HIV treatment and KP guidelines of WHO. These approaches are accepted in generalized epidemics and for the general population where successful models exist; however, few organizations provide or initiate ART at KP community-based services. Conclusions: The application of a differentiated service approach for KP could increase the number of people who know their status and receive effective and sustained prevention and treatment for HIV. However, while community-based and lay provider testing are effective and affordable, they are not implemented to scale. Furthermore regulatory barriers to legitimizing <b>lay</b> and <b>peer</b> providers as part of healthcare delivery systems need to be overcome in many settings.

60|$|The House of Lords {{was once}} a reality. It {{consisted}} of the ecclesiastical hierarchy--the bishops and mitred abbots; with the official hierarchy--the great nobles, who were also great satraps of provinces, and great military commanders. It was thus mainly made up of practical life-members, appointed by merit. The <b>peers,</b> <b>lay</b> and spiritual, were the men who commended themselves to the sovereign as able administrators. Gradually, with prolonged peace, the hereditary element choked and swamped the nominated element. The abbots disappeared, the lords multiplied. The peer ceased {{to be the leader}} of a shire, and sank into a mere idle landowner. Wealth alone grew at last to be a title to the peerage. The House of Lords became a House of Landlords. And the English people submitted to the claim of irresponsible wealth or irresponsible acres to exercise a veto upon national legislation. The anomaly, utterly indefensible in itself, had grown up so slowly that the public accepted it--nay, even defended it. And other countries, accustomed to regard England--the Pecksniff among nations--as a perfect model of political wisdom, swallowed half the anomaly, and all the casuistical reasoning that was supposed to justify it, without a murmur. But if we strip the facts bare from the glamour that surrounds them, the plain truth is this--England allows an assembly of hereditary nobodies to retard or veto its legislation nowadays, simply because it never noticed the moment when a practical House of administrative officers lapsed into a nest of plutocrats.|$|R
