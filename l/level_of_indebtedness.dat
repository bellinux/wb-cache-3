A second coup attempt on November 27, 1992, took place while Chávez was in prison but was directed by a group of young military officers who were loyal to the Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the effect of a change in the {{monetary}} policy interest rate on aggregate demand may be larger at higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness</b> through its impact on cash flows. However, the extent of credit constraints may be at least as important, if not more so. In particular, monetary policy could have a larger impact on aggregate demand when credit constraints are pervasive (which could be the case at low or high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness,</b> or both). This paper examines {{the extent to which the}} strength of credit growth, which can be seen as a proxy for credit constraints, may affect the transmission of monetary policy in a way that cannot be captured in linear models. The results reveal that GDP growth is more responsive to interest rate shocks when credit growth is low. Separate models for household and business credit growth confirm this finding: consumption and business investment are more responsive to interest rate shocks when credit is growing slowly for the household and business sectors, respectively. monetary policy; business-cycle asymmetries; threshold models...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: (1) To examine {{trends in}} level of student loan {{indebtedness}} {{for groups of}} pharmacists that were first licensed between 1980 and 2006; (2) To examine if demographic variables are associated with level of student loan indebtedness; (3) To examine the association between student loan debt and choice of practice setting while controlling for demographic variables. Methods: Data {{for this study were}} collected from a national random sample of 3, 000 pharmacists using a self administered survey. Descriptive statistics were used to examine trends in <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness.</b> The relationships between <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness,</b> demographic variables and practice setting choice were examined using Chi-square statistics. Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine the independent association of student loan debt and choice of practice setting while controlling for demographic variables. Results: The proportion of licensed pharmacists reporting student loan debt after graduation, and the mean amount of debt incurred increased between 1980 and 2006. Non-white pharmacists incurred debt at a higher proportion compared to white, and they also incurred significantly higher levels of debt. A lower <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness</b> was associated with choosing independent practice over chain practice. Conclusions: Student loan indebtedness has been increasing over time, especially for non-white pharmacy students. Future research should be done to examine other factors that might influence student debt load, work contributions and choice of practice settings. The affordability of pharmacy education for students of color and how salaries may or may not help off-set these costs also should be examined closely...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{transition}} to monetary stability, we analyzed the real effort rate with the debt service for Portugal in a context of a decrease in nominal interest rates. Monthly time series data from January 1991 to September 2013 were used. The UECM of the ARDL model was applied which allowed capturing the long-run and short-run effects. The results suggest that the Portuguese reality has two distinct behaviors, one before and one after effecting monetary union. We detected the presence of different variables in explaining the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness</b> in both periods. In the first period (1991 M 1 - 1998 M 12), only financial effort is relevant when explaining the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness</b> of the economic agents. In the second period (1999 M 1 - 2013 M 9) the financial depth, German balance of payments and current balance and capital account are also statistically significant in the increase of the indebtedness level. The research supports that in the first period, the increase of financial effort reduces the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>indebtedness</b> of the economic agents. In the second period, we have the presence of a structural break, resulting from the regime change that occurred in the economy. In this period, for a decrease of financial effort there is a reduction of the indebtedness level, in the long-run. The results support that there is a regime shift around 1999, whose economic nature produced an economic impact that caused indebtedness change, before and after euro introduction. For the second period (1999 M 1 - 2013 M 9) we obtained a cointegration relationship between financial effort and indebtedness. ...|$|E
