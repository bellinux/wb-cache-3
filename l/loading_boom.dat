The mill is located a short way west of downtown Middlebury. The building is four stories in height, and is built out of locally quarried stone laid in irregular courses. It is covered by a gabled roof. The main facade, facing south toward Mill Street, is symmetrical, with recessed loading bay entrances at the center of each level, flanked on each side by sash windows.

He brought in dairy cattle, hogs and other agriculture. His two sons founded the Pecho Ranch & Stock Co., {{and built a}} ranch house, a complex of barns, a creamery, stables, sheds, and a waterwheel for power. On the south bluff of Spooner's Cove they utilized a warehouse with a long chute that led down to a wharf and a <b>loading</b> <b>boom</b> to service coastal steamers. The land just to the north was owned by Alexander S. Hazard, who also raised crops and maintained a dairy. Hoping {{to cash in on}} California's growing need for timber, he planted hundreds of eucalyptus trees, turning Hazard Canyon into a prospective lumber farm. Unfortunately, eucalyptus proved unsatisfactory for commercial use. In the early 1940s, a flood scoured Hazard Canyon, and in 1947 a grass fire burned up the coast from Diablo Canyon, destroying much of what had been the Hazard dairy buildings. However, Hazard's legacy, the rows of eucalyptus trees, remains. Rancher Oliver C. Field bought the land in the early 1940s, but sold it to Irene McAllister about ten years later. In 1965 the property was purchased by the State of California for a state park, and it was decided to keep the name McAllister had given it: [...] "Montaña de Oro".|$|E

Main cycles of the work of Crawler Cranes can be divided into: lifting and lowering the working <b>load,</b> <b>boom</b> lifting and lowering, rotation (slewing) around its vertical axes in 360 º, and translational movement forward/backwards. In this workshop, we are going to simulate the work of crawler crane while rotating around its vertical axes when fully engaged with load, which hangs in some height. The aim is to see the effects of dynamic forces (or moments) in the crane’s construction during this work cycle, particularly at the start and end of the rotation when working load swings. Reasons for doing this study are occasions of crane instability, while the crane rotates and load swings. We will research the effects of angular speed and workload swaying (swinging) in overall stability of crawler crane by looking for results of swaying angles, dynamic momentums and tensions in cables. By using the modeling applications and applying simulations [3], we are confident that we will have better view of occasions in case of crane rotation and some conclusions for enforcing security and design rules in order to avoid instability and overturning.

Design of tower cranes is carried out in accordance with RD 22 - 166 - 86 “Construction of tower cranes.

The calculation of these moments is carried out with the use of empirical coefficients and quite time-consuming.

40|$|Summary. [...] The {{purpose of}} this report is to provide {{experimental}} resuKs for comparison with theoretical analyses of stress diffusion problems. The structures considered consist of plane reinforced sheet which has been assumed not to buckle. Symmetrical loads are applied to the edge booms connected to the sheet by continuous no-slip joints. Attention is concentrated on the stress distribution near {{the ends of the}} parallel strips of plate. -An outline of the existing theoretical work which is applicable to this type of problem is given. The stringer-sheet theory, the only one capable of dealing adequately with unreinforced sheet, is compared with the photoelastic results. It is shown that the stringer-sheet theory overestima[tes the peak shear stresses near the corners of the strips and consequently also the rate of diffusion of <b>load</b> from <b>boom</b> to sheet. It is also shown that the experimental shear stresses [...] are in reasonable agreement with those predicted by a more exact plane-stress theory. This theory predicts that the peak shear stress in the plate is 2 / = times the direct stress in the boom {{at the end of the}} panel. However, with the type of joint considered here, the maximum shear stress is likely to be much higher than the value given by this prediction. Some attention is also given to transverse end stiffeners and it would seem that these normally have very little effect on the shear stresses. • The photoelastic models were made from the Allylstrene plastic called C.

With the recent spurt in awareness towards the environment, efforts are being made to control the spread of oil spills. One such mechanism used to control the spread of spilt oil is the containment boom. Oil is confined to a limited area {{with the help of a}} boom and then removed with the help of skimmers or other devices which can absorb oil. Surprisingly, not much work has been done in this field towards standardization of guidelines for deploying booms. Identifying the seriousness of this problem, a study of the sea-keeping performance of the boom was made by model testing. Experiments were performed in two stages with a 1 : 4 scale rigid model of a boom section and a 1 : 4 scale flexible model of a continuous boom respectively. The models were tested for varying boom parameters like buoyancy to weight ratio, mass distribution, skirt depth, gap ratio and mooring position. To understand the relationship between the different parameters, the booms were tested in different environments with regular, random and short-crested waves and different currents selectively. The motion of the boom, wave elevation, wave run-up and the mooring forces were measured using optical tracking systems, accelerometers, capacitance probes and <b>load</b> cells. <b>Boom</b> performance criteria were defined assuming that drainage and oversplash failures are the primary modes of failure.

Computational strategies and difficulties encountered during the analyses are also addressed. The {{purpose of this paper}} is not to compare the benefits of one sail design over the other.

Over the range of parameters studied, the maximum sail deflection and boom deformations are a nonlinear function of the sail properties. In general, the vibration frequencies and modes are closely spaced. For some vibration mode shapes, local deformation patterns that dominate the response are identified.

Booms are characterized by one-large dimension while the cross section is very thin and changes with the applications, affecting both weight and stiffness of the entire structure. In order to be stored and transported within a very small volume, booms are pressed down flatly and/or rolled up. Folding produces permanent stresses on the composite structure that act as a pre-load. In this work, we study the buckling behavior of thin composite structures considering the residual stress after deployment. The structural analysis was performed using the non-linear finite element method. A representative element of the boom was rolled up on a cylindrical mandrel and the stress {{due to the fact}} that the composite structure was changing shape were introduced as initial condition for the buckling analysis. The adopted model was a C cross- section with radius of 10 mm, thickness of 0. 2 mm and 5 m length made by carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP).

40|$|The present {{docking system}} for the Orbiter uses {{mechanical}} capture latches that are actuated by contact forces. The forces are generated when the two approaching masses collide at the docking mechanism. There is always a trade-off between having high enough momentum to effect capture and low enough momentum to avoid structural overload or unacceptable angular displacements. The use of the present docking system includes a contact thrusting maneuver that causes high docking loads to be included into Space Station. A magnetic docking aid has been developed to reduce the load s during docking. The magnetic docking aid is comprised of two extendible booms that are attached adjacent to the docking structure with electromagnets attached {{on the end of}} the boom. On the mating vehicle, two steel plates are attached. As the Orbiter approaches Space Station, the booms are extended, and the magnets attach to the actuated (without thrusting), by slowly driving the extendible booms to the stowed position, thus reacting the <b>load</b> into the <b>booms.</b> This results in a docking event that has lower loads induced into Space Station structure. This method also greatly simplifies the Station berthing tasks, since the Shuttle Remote Manipulation System (SRMS) arm need only place the element to be berthed on the magnets (no load required), rather than firing the Reaction Control System (RCS) jets to provide the required force for capture latch actuation.

Reduction and limitation of this risk is addressed by de-orbiting end-of-life maneuvers.

In DLR´s Solar Sail demonstrator Gossamer- 1, a 5 m x 5 m squared solar sail, four sail quadrants are spanned out by four thin shell CFRP booms. Facilitating a tip deployment, the booms are flattened and coiled each on a cylinder of a deployment unit for stowage, while the boom roots are fixed in an interface to the spacecraft bus in a cross like arrangement. Having its purpose in transferring occurring <b>boom</b> <b>loads</b> into the main structure, the interface needs to be flexible at the same time, mimicking the changing cross section of the boom, once it deploys and transforms from flat to its full cross sectional dimensions. Another interface connects the sails to the booms, while holding the boom´s cross section in a semi-deployed state. These found conditions are imperfect compared to using the full cross sectional shape of the boom with its full second moment of area and an ideally clamped root fixation. Simulating the boom and its interfaces of the Gossamer- 1 demonstrator, several booms are tested in an advanced vertical boom test stand at the DLR Space Structures Lab @ Uni of DLR Braunschweig. Mechanical characteristics and properties of full scale booms with ideal boundary conditions and realistic interfaces are being investigated, enabling a direct comparison. Applying certain realistic load cases, like lateral bending, axial compression and combinations of both, thresholds and robustness as well as load carrying capabilities after buckling several times are quantified in practical tests. Thus characterizing the Gossamer- 1 boom under ideal and realistic boundary conditions is realized, specifying the boom performance in reality and providing the base for a robust Gossamer Spacecraft design that facilitates thin shell CFRP booms. This paper gives a detailed insight on the test stand and setup, used interfaces and boundary conditions, testing procedures, and discusses the test results of both configurations on characteristic load-displacement curves and acquired values for buckling failure design...|$|R
