A new class of FEA codes based on explicit time integration was developed that reduced computational time and memory requirements. The dynamic explicit FEA approach uses a central different explicit scheme to integrate the equations of motion. This approach uses <b>lumped</b> <b>mass</b> matrices and a typical time step on order of millionths of seconds. The method has proved to be robust and efficient for typical industrial problems.|$|E

The <b>lumped</b> <b>mass</b> method is currently favored in multibody dynamics software packages because of its computational efficiency. This paper, however, presents a multibody dynamics formulation based on the consistent mass approach which should prove to be as computationally efficient as the <b>lumped</b> <b>mass</b> approach. It is shown that when component flexibility is modelled using modal coordinates, the equations of motion, as formulated by these two methods, are very similar in appearance, thereby facilitating their comparison. It is also shown, through simulation of a simple multibody system, that a system formulated with the <b>lumped</b> <b>mass</b> approximation will often require more finite elements and smaller integration step sizes than the corresponding consistent mass system...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present work was {{to examine the effects of}} asphaltenes, {{amphiphilic}} molecules found in crude oils, on subsurface contamination by petroleum liquids. Initial experiments were conducted, using naphthalene as a representative target contaminant, to determine the contaminant equilibrium partitioning relationships in an asphaltene-oil-water system. Further experiments were conducted to determine if the presence of asphaltenes in petroleum liquids affected resistance to interphase mass transfer of naphthalene in situ with aging. Results were analyzed using a <b>lumped</b> <b>mass</b> transfer coefficient calculated after various aging periods. Experimental data suggested that adding increasing amounts of asphaltenes to gasoline resulted in a marked increase in the <b>lumped</b> <b>mass</b> transfer coefficient with time during aging periods of up to 12 days.

40|$|Abstract: The current paper {{describes}} {{a simple and}} yet comprehensive lumped-parameter model (LPM) for simulating the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) side-impact safety tests for passenger vehicles. The LPM includes new <b>lumped</b> <b>masses,</b> not previously reported in a single multibody model, for key vehicle side-structure systems identified {{with the help of}} an energy-based study conducted using explicit finite element analysis of two passenger vehicles. In addition to the vehicle side structure, <b>lumped</b> <b>masses</b> for the NHTSA side-impact barrier and ‘rest of vehicle’, the latter implying the mass of the vehicle minus the combined mass of the side-structure subsystems considered in the LPM, have been incorporated so that the total mass of the system corresponds to that of an actual vehicle– barrier system in a NHTSA side-impact test (Lateral Impact New Car Assessment Program (LINCAP) or FMVSS 214). The <b>lumped</b> <b>masses</b> are interconnected with elastic–plastic springs. A unique feature of the present model is the inclusion of two lumped side-impact dummies for obtaining predictions of the front and rear (thoracic trauma index (TTI)). The validity of the present LPM is established by performing LS-DYNA-based LINCAP simulations of two real-world vehicles, namely the Dodge Neon and Dodge Intrepid, and obtaining a reasonably good correlation of the computed structural and occupant responses as well as TTI (front and rear) with the corresponding test results reported by the NHTSA...|$|R
40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} starts with the {{development}} of a Graphical User Interface to aid the manual control of the experimental crane model and to achieve a better container management system. A structural analysis of the laboratory rig is then carried out. The technique used is to divide the whole structure into two parts: a stationary framework and a moving substructure (including its attachments). The dynamic effect of the moving substructure is represented by four equivalent, time-dependent, contacting forces (or <b>lumped</b> <b>masses),</b> and the dynamic behaviour of the stationary framework, induced by the moving substructure, is predicted by computing the responses to these forces (or <b>lumped</b> <b>masses).</b> Before the forced vibration responses can be obtained a finite element model of the scale crane rig has first to be established and validated by means of modal testing. A general technique for incorporating a standard finite element package into a procedure to calculate the dynamic responses of structures due to time-dependent moving point forces is then developed. In order to take the inertia effects of the moving substructure into account a new concept of equivalent time-dependent moving <b>lumped</b> <b>masses</b> is introduced. A general procedure has been developed to allow a standard finite element package to be extended to deal with the dynamic analyses of a three-dimensional framework subjected to the two-dimensional multiple moving masses. The theoretical results obtained are validated by comparison with experimental findings...|$|R
