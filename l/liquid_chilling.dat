40|$|High {{reliable}} {{diode laser}} pump modules {{are essential for}} free-space optical telecommunications. Besides the reliability, low mass and small dimensions, radiation-hardness and low power-consumption are requirements to be met for space applications. A diode laser module suited for pumping Nd:YAG lasers for optical intersatellite links has been developed. The module consists of two diode laser bars overlaid by a polarization beam splitter to increase the system's reliability. Each diode laser bar consists of six emitters. If the integrated photodiode detects the failure of one bar, the second, substitute bar is switched on and can fully sustain all module functions. To equalize the beam quality of the diode laser bar, a pair of micro step mirrors is used for each bar. The laser beam is focussed on the entrance of a d= 200 µm, NA= 0. 22 fiber. Both the coupling efficiency and {{the accuracy of the}} mounting of the diode laser components have been analyzed by raytracing. Passive cooling has been chosen because <b>liquid</b> <b>chilling</b> systems are unsuitable for space applications. To evaluate the effects of different heat sink materials and to predict the temperature drop over the module, a 3 D finite element analysis for the steady-state temperature distribution of the module has been performed. The optical output power of the module described above amounts to 2, 8 W with one bar operating derated to 0. 5 x maximum current, and the whole unit fits in a housing of 78 x 50 x 24 mm. Further developments will lead to a more compact design and a smaller fiber diameter...|$|E

In the present study, a low-resource GC×GC instrument using an electrically heated and liquid-cooled single-stage thermal modulator that requires no cryogenic materials is evaluated. The instrument also uses at-column heating, thus eliminating the need for a convection oven to house the two columns. The stainless-steel modulator tube is coated with PDMS, which can be heated to 350 °C for sample injection into the second-dimension column. The modulator is cooled to – 30 °C by a 100 mL/min flow of PEG by means of a commercial <b>liquid</b> <b>chiller</b> and a small recirculating pump. Resistive heating of the modulator tube is provided by a programmable power supply, which uses a voltage program that results in increasing modulator temperature during an analysis.

40|$|Architectures for {{extended}} duration missions often include an on-orbit replenishment {{of the space}} vehicle's cryogenic liquid propellants. Such a replenishment could be accomplished via a tank-to-tank transfer from a dedicated tanker or a more permanent propellant depot storage tank. Minimizing the propellant loss associated with transfer line and receiver propellant tank thermal conditioning is essential for mass savings. A new methodology for conducting tank-to-tank transfer while minimizing such losses has been demonstrated. Charge-Hold-Vent is the traditional methodology for conducting a tank-to-tank propellant transfer. A small amount of cryogenic liquid is introduced to chill the transfer line and propellant tank. As the propellant absorbs heat and undergoes a phase change, the tank internal pressure increases. The tank is then vented to relieve pressure prior to another charge of cryogenic liquid being introduced. This cycle is repeated until the transfer lines and tank are sufficiently chilled and the replenishment of the propellant tank is complete. This method suffers inefficiencies due to multiple chill and vent cycles within the transfer lines and associated feed system components. Additionally, this system requires precise measuring of cryogenic fluid delivery for each transfer, multiple valve cycling events, and other complexities associated with cycled operations. To minimize propellant loss and greatly simplify on-orbit operations, an alternate methodology has been designed and demonstrated. The Vented Chill / No Vent Fill method is a simpler, constant flow approach in which the propellant tank and transfer lines are only chilled once. The receiver tank is continuously vented as cryogenic <b>liquid</b> <b>chills</b> the transfer lines, tank mass and ullage space. Once chilled sufficiently, the receiver tank valve is closed and the tank is completely filled. Interestingly, the vent valve can be closed prior to receiver tank components reaching liquid saturation temperature. An incomplete fill results if insufficient energy {{is removed from the}} tank's thermal mass and ullage space. The key to successfully conducting the no vent fill is to assure that sufficient energy is removed from the system prior to closing the receiver tank vent valve.

40|$|Dynamic {{modeling}} of vapor compression equipment is gaining increasing attention in recent years. The availability of cheap and powerful computers is simplifying the heretofore formidable challenge of numerically solving the non-linear differential equations {{that arise in}} first-principle based system models. Recent advances in the HVAC industry such as fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) require, for the design and validation of algorithms, extensive chiller data with and without faults. Faulty performance data from chillers {{is extremely difficult to}} get from commercial installations and therefore models are necessary. This requirement necessitates the use of first-principles since the fault and its severity need to be varied in a physically meaningful manner to produce useful data. First-principles models involve the solution of transient mass, energy and momentum balances which are a system of non-linear, coupled, partial differential equations. Limited study has been done in the past on identifying efficient methods of formulating and solving these systems for centrifugal liquid chillers. Existing system models are either not for centrifugal compressors or do not contain enough detail in the heat exchangers to allow fault simulation. Also, little information is provided regarding the execution speed and accuracy of different modeling approaches. This thesis includes a comparison of the finite-volume and the moving-boundary formulations for modeling dynamics of shell-and-tube heat-exchangers. The finite volume models performance is investigated using direct solution methods with explicit integration and a sequential solution method with implicit integration. The moving boundary model is studied using a direct solution method and a state-space formulation. The goal is to identify the computationally most efficient approach for future model developers. Validation results with and without faults are presented, using data obtained from a 90 -ton centrifugal <b>liquid</b> <b>chiller</b> test-stand available at Herrick Labs, Purdue University. It is found that the direct solution methods are preferable for both the formulations. The sequential solution with implicit integration is less robust in convergence than the direct solution when the finite volume formulation is used. The state-space solution when using the moving boundary formulation is restricted to small transients due to the linearization approximation. Between the formulations, the finite volume tolerates a wider range of inlet conditions than the latter and is preferable when start-up is needed. The moving boundary approach executes twice as fast as the finite volume approach for comparable accuracy. ...|$|R

Two lines of action were explored: innovative Personal Cooling Systems (PCS) and Personal Monitoring Equipment (PME). PME refers to sensors affixed to the worker that warn of an approaching heat stress condition, thereby preventing it. Three types of cooling systems were investigated: Pre-Chilled or Forced-Air System (PCFA), Umbilical Fluid-Chilled System (UFCS), and Passive Vest System (PVS). Of these, the UFCS leads the way.

40|$|Replacement of the {{conventional}} refrigerant HCFC- 22 (R 22) {{is one of the}} urgent issues to be solved within the scheduled time-frame of the international regulation of the HCFCs. Since there exists no pure fluid that can replace R 22 in the same general way as HFC- 134 a (R 134 a) is a replacement for CFC- 12, HFC mixtures are suggested as possible substitutes. The main aim of this work has been to find good alternatives to R 22 in two different applications. For this purpose a comprehensive simulation program was developed. Together with methods for technical and economic optimization, the program can be used to find the optimal design for a specific working fluid ("new design situation") as well as the optimal working fluid for a specific plant ("drop-in situation"). As one application, the replacement of R 22 with the zeotropic HFC mixture R 407 C in a <b>liquid</b> <b>chiller,</b> equipped with a dry-expansion evaporator and a condenser with shell-side condensation, was investigated, both experimentally and theoretically. Full-scale measurements show an evaporator performance of R 407 C similar to that of R 22, except at very low temperatures. The simulation model could predict the change in evaporation heat transfer within 10 %. Changes in design parameters, such as the optimal number of evaporator tubes for a given area, or the distribution of heat exchanger area between the evaporator and the suction gas heat exchanger for a given cost, could increase the performance by only 0. 5 % and 3 %, respectively. The condenser design should, however, be made differently for a zeotropic mixture, since the measurements show a decrease in overall heat transfer coefficient of up to 70 %. This decrease was not predicted by the simulation program, implying that the calculation model must consider not only the mass transfer resistance, but also the degree of condensate mixing. The other application studied deals with heat pumps used for district heating. In these heat pumps, with condensation temperatures up to 80 ºC, the only commercially available, non-flammable alternative to replace R 22 is R 134 a. Its use could, however, result in a decrease of heating capacity by up to 35 %. Screening and simulations show that there are HFC mixtures, such as 25 %R 32 + 75 %R 134 a, and 30 %R 143 a + 25 %R 125 + 45 %R 134 a (by mole), which can offer an increase in capacity of 10 - 20 % compared to R 134 a.

It is concluded that within the limits of the method used the melting point depression, and hence the water potential, of intracelhlar and extracenuiar fluids is the same. Over the past half century there has been considerable interest in the possibility that there may be differences between the osmotic activity of water inside and outside the living mammalian cell.

40|$|Significant {{boil-off}} {{losses from}} cryogenic propellant storage systems in long-duration space mission applications result in additional propellant and larger tanks. The potential propellant mass loss reductions with the Zero Boil-off (ZBO) concept are substantial; therefore, further exploration through technology programs has been initiated within NASA. A large-scale {{demonstration of the}} ZBO concept has been devised utilizing the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Multipurpose Hydrogen Test Bed (MHTB) along with a cryo-cooler unit. The ZBO concept consists of an active cryo-cooling system integrated with traditional passive thermal insulation. The cryo-cooler is interfaced with the MHTB and spraybar recirculation/mixer system {{in a manner that}} enables thermal energy removal at a rate that equals the total tank heat leak. The liquid hydrogen (LH 2) is withdrawn from the tank, passed through a heat exchanger, and then the <b>chilled</b> <b>liquid</b> is sprayed back into the tank through a spraybar. The test series will be performed over a 20 - 30 day period. Tests will be conducted at multiple fill levels to demonstrate concept viability and to provide benchmark data to be used in analytical model development. In this paper the test set-up and test procedures are presented...|$|R
40|$|Laboratories run around-the-clock aging {{tests to}} try to {{understand}} as quickly as possible how long new Li-ion battery designs will last under certain duty cycles. These tests may include factors such as duty cycles, climate, battery power profiles, and battery stress statistics. Such tests are generally accelerated and do not consider possible dwell time at high temperatures and states-of-charge. Battery life-predictive models provide guidance as to how long Li-ion batteries may last under real-world electric-drive vehicle applications. Worst-case aging scenarios are extracted from hundreds of real-world duty cycles developed from vehicle travel surveys. Vehicles examined included PHEV 10 and PHEV 40 EDVs under fixed (28 degrees C), limited cooling (forced ambient temperature), and aggressive cooling (20 degrees C <b>chilled</b> <b>liquid)</b> scenarios using either nightly charging or opportunity charging. The results show that battery life expectancy is 7. 8 - 13. 2 years for the PHEV 10 using a nightly charge in Phoenix, AZ (hot climate), and that the 'aggressive' cooling scenario can extend battery life by 1 - 3 years, while the 'limited' cooling scenario shortens battery life by 1 - 2 years. Frequent (opportunity) charging can reduce battery life by 1 year for the PHEV 10, while frequent charging can extend battery life by one-half year...|$|R
