40|$|Lamp poles {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} highway and community components in modern cities. Their supporting parts are primarily tapered octagonal cones specifically designed for wind resistance. The geometry and the positions of the lamp poles are important information for various applications. For example, they are important to monitoring deformation of aged lamp poles, maintaining an efficient highway GIS system, and also facilitating possible feature-based calibration of mobile LiDAR systems. In this paper, we present a novel geometric model for octagonal lamp poles. The model consists of seven parameters in which a rotation about the z-axis is included, and points are constrained by the trigonometric property of 2 D octagons after applying the rotations. For the geometric fitting of the <b>lamp</b> <b>pole</b> point cloud captured by a terrestrial LiDAR, accurate initial parameter values are essential. They can be estimated by first fitting the points to a circular cone model and this is followed by some basic point cloud processing techniques. The model was verified by fitting both simulated and real data. The real data includes several <b>lamp</b> <b>pole</b> point clouds captured by: (1) Faro Focus 3 D and (2) Velodyne HDL- 32 E. The fitting results using the proposed model are promising, and up to 2. 9 mm improvement in fitting accuracy was realized for the real <b>lamp</b> <b>pole</b> point clouds compared to using the conventional circular cone model. The overall result suggests that the proposed model is appropriate and rigorous...|$|E

In the late 1990s, the low pressure sodium lighting was failing {{and most of the}} cobra-neck conventional poles were replaced in favour of shaded high-mast lighting, with high-pressure sodium lamps (HPS); however the elevated Gardiner still retained the LPS cobra-neck poles for seven more years, while the section immediately west of Dufferin Street still contains several with HPS lamps.

40|$|Generic person {{detection}} is an ill-posed {{problem as}} con-text is widely ignored. Local context {{can be used}} to split the generic detection task into easier sub-problems, which was recently explored by classifier grids. The detection prob-lem gets simplified spatially by training separate classifiers for each possible location in the image. So far, adaptive grid based approaches only focused on exploring the spe-cific background class. In contrast, we propose a method using different types of context in order to collect scene spe-cific samples from both, the background and the object class over time. These samples are used to update the specific object detectors. Due to limiting label noise and avoiding direct feedback loops our system can robustly adapt to the scene without drifting. Results on the PETS 2009 dataset show significantly improved person detections, especially, during static and dynamic occlusions (e. g., <b>lamp</b> <b>poles</b> and crowded scenes). 1...|$|R

40|$|Millimetre wave (mm-wave) {{communication}} is {{considered as one}} of the most important enablers for the fifth generation communication (5 G) system to support data rate of Gbps and above. In some scenarios, it is crucial to maintain a line of sight (LOS) link for users enjoying 5 G immersive experiences and thus requiring very high data rate. In this paper, we investigate the LOS probability in mm-wave systems. In particular, we study the impact of access point (AP) and blockage height on the LOS probability and propose a solution to effectively enhance the LOS coverage by using high-rise APs on top of low-rise APs normally installed on street furniture, e. g., <b>lamp</b> <b>poles.</b> Two deployment options are explored: 1) irregular deployment and 2) regular deployment, where LOS probability is derived for both cases. Simulation results show that the impact of AP height on LOS probability is significant and using coordinated high-rise APs jointly deployed with low-rise APs will substantially improve the LOS probability.

40|$|The Velodyne LiDAR {{series is}} one of the most popular {{spinning}} beam LiDAR systems currently available on the market. In this paper, the temporal stability of the range measurements of the Velodyne HDL- 32 E LiDAR system is first investigated as motivation for the development of a new automatic calibration method that allows quick and frequent recovery of the inherent time-varying errors. The basic principle of the method is that the LiDAR’s internal systematic error parameters are estimated by constraining point clouds of some known and automatically detected cylindrical features such as <b>lamp</b> <b>poles</b> to fit to the 3 D cylinder models. This is analogous to the plumb-line calibration method in which the lens distortion parameters are estimated by constraining the image points of straight lines to fit to the 2 D line model. The calibration can be performed at every measurement epoch in both static and kinematic modes. Four real datasets were used to verify the method, two of which were captured in static mode and the other two in kinematic mode. The overall results indicate that up to approximately 72 % and 41 % accuracy improvement were realized as a result of the calibration for the static and kinematic datasets, respectively...|$|R
