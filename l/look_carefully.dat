25|$|Republican U.S. Senators Saxby Chambliss and Richard Burr {{reported}} that Russian authorities had separately asked both the FBI (at least twice: during March and November 2011) and the CIA (September 2011) to <b>look</b> <b>carefully</b> into Tamerlan Tsarnaev and provide {{more information about}} him back to Russia. Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) secretly recorded phone conversations between Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his mother (they vaguely and indirectly discussed jihad) and sent these to the FBI as evidence of possible extremist links within the family. However, while Russia offered US intelligence services warnings that Tsarnaev planned to link up with extremist groups abroad, an FBI investigation yielded {{no evidence to support}} those claims at the time. In addition, subsequent U.S. requests for additional information about Tsarnaev went unanswered by the Russians.|$|E

2500|$|The 20th century British {{anthropologist}} Mary Douglas {{wrote that}} {{to find the}} underlying logic of the first chapters of Leviticus {{about how to make}} a sacrifice and how to lay out the animal sections on the altar, one needs to <b>look</b> <b>carefully</b> at what Leviticus says about bodies and parts of bodies, what is inner and outer, and what is on top and underneath. Douglas suggested this alignment of the three levels of Mount Sinai, the animal sacrifice, and the Tabernacle: ...|$|E

2500|$|Although female genital {{mutilation}} – {{the practice of}} cutting off a woman's labia and sometimes clitoris, {{and in some cases}} creating a seal across her entire vulva – is illegal across the Western world, Davis argues that [...] "when you really <b>look</b> <b>carefully</b> at the language used in some of those laws, they would also make illegal the labiaplasties that are being done by plastic surgeons in the U.S." [...] The World Health Organization (WHO) defines female {{genital mutilation}} as [...] "all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons." [...] The WHO writes that the term is not generally applied to elective procedures such as labiaplasty.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{this early}} interest, most {{scientists}} ignored Stevenson's work. According to his New York Times obituary, his detractors {{saw him as}} [...] "earnest, dogged but ultimately misguided, led astray by gullibility, wishful thinking and a tendency to see science where others saw superstition." [...] Critics suggested that the children or their parents had deceived him, {{that he was too}} willing to believe them, and that he had asked them leading questions. In addition, critics said, the results were subject to confirmation bias, in that cases not supportive of the hypothesis were not presented as counting against it. Leonard Angel, a philosopher of religion, told The New York Times that Stevenson did not follow proper standards. [...] "ut you do have to <b>look</b> <b>carefully</b> to see it; that's why he's been very persuasive to many people." ...|$|E
2500|$|From here, hikers {{can take}} one of two routes: either turn right (west), walk several hundred yards, [...] and <b>look</b> <b>carefully</b> {{for a pair of}} cairns in the woods on your left marking {{the north end of the}} Twilight Park Trail (not yet official, but well-marked) OR turn left and proceed around the mountain, past one of the easily spotted plane wrecks. As the path curves to the right, you will {{eventually}} encounter a [...] cairn in the middle of the path marking the south end of the Twilight Park Trail. [...] A combination of smaller cairns, surveyor's tape flags and old blue paint blazes have been used by various stealth maintainers over the years to keep this wet and sometimes hard-to-spot route marked. While not seriously steep, it is almost constantly ascending, responsible for the last 450 vertical feet up the mountain in less than a mile. [...] The southerly approach is probably best, since the steepest portions of the ascent are to the south and are best handled going up rather than down.|$|E

60|$|Fifteen years more, {{and in the}} {{beautiful}} Westminster Abbey, amid the gorgeous tombs, there stood four sorrowful figures.

60|$|The King {{realized}} {{the truth of}} this. Indeed, {{when he came to}} <b>look</b> <b>carefully</b> at the wooden head, he did not blame his daughters for not wishing to marry it.

60|$|This is {{an unusually}} full example, but the calendar, the hours, the seven psalms, and the litany, are {{in almost all}} the MSS.
