2500|$|Fused quartz is a glass {{made from}} chemically-pure silica. It has {{excellent}} resistance to thermal shock, {{being able to}} survive immersion in water while red hot. [...] However, its high melting temperature (1723°C) and viscosity {{make it difficult to}} work with. [...] Normally, other substances are added to simplify processing. One is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, [...] "soda"), which lowers the glass-transition temperature. The soda makes the glass water-soluble, which is usually undesirable, so <b>lime</b> (<b>CaO,</b> <b>calcium</b> <b>oxide,</b> generally obtained from limestone), some magnesium oxide (MgO) and aluminium oxide (Al2O3) are added to provide for a better chemical durability. The resulting glass contains about 70 to 74% silica by weight and is called a soda-lime glass. Soda-lime glasses account for about 90% of manufactured glass.|$|E

Steel slag is a promising material that could be used in carbon dioxide sequestration, by mineral carbonation, due to its high reactivity towards CO 2 and also due to its high availability, especially near steel production complexes. The main carbonation reaction responsible for CO 2 sequestration in steel slag {{is known to}} be the conversion of free <b>lime</b> (<b>CaO)</b> into <b>calcium</b> carbonate (CaCO 3), but when the carbonation process takes place in more severe conditions (such as high pressure and/or temperature), other minerals such calcium and magnesium silicates can react, thus sequestering more CO 2. This work presents the processes of synthesizing some minerals found in steel slags (β-C 2 S, γ-C 2 S, Akermanite, Srebrodolskite and Bredigite) and their characterization. Obtaining these mineral phases separately has the purpose of better understanding the reactions that takes place between these minerals and CO 2 in different mineral carbonation conditions.

The products were characterized by using differential thermal analysis (DTA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). DTA curves show that calcite has endothermic peak and impurity affects the onset of reactions. The more the impurity increases, the more energy changes increase. At 800 - 900 °C, calcite was decomposed into solid <b>calcium</b> <b>oxide</b> (<b>CaO)</b> and gaseous CO 2. <b>Lime</b> (<b>CaO)</b> used as the base of expandable material is the ultimate product of heated calcite.
