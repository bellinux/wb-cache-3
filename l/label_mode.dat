Death Label's difficulty is roughly equivalent {{to that of the}} normal game's second loop, with a number of alterations made to the bosses and their attack pattern. The most notable change is made at the final boss fight of Death Label, where the player faces two Hibachis simultaneously. According to top players, this is the hardest iteration in the DoDonPachi series taking 7 years (from 2003 until 2010-09-18) to clear.|$|E

Informa tion flow control allows the enforcement of end-to-end security policies but {{has been difficult to}} put into practice. This paper describes the decentralized <b>label</b> <b>mode</b> l, a new label model for control of information flow in systems with mutual distrust and decentralized authority. The model improves on existing multilevel security mo dels by allowing users to declassify information in a decentralized way, and by improving support for fine-grained data sharing. It supports static program analysis of information flow, so that programs can be certified to permit only acceptable information flows, while largely avoiding the overhead of run-time checking. The paper i ntroduces the language Jif, an extension to Java that provides static checking of information flow using the decentralized label model...|$|E
40|$|The {{onset of}} monami ~ [...] the {{synchronous}} waving of sea grass beds {{driven by a}} steady flow [...] is modeled as a linear instability of the flow. Unlike previous works, our model considers the drag exerted by the grass in establishing the steady flow profile, and in damping out perturbations to it. We find two distinct modes of instability, which we <b>label</b> <b>Mode</b> 1 and Mode 2. Mode 1 {{is closely related to}} Kelvin-Helmholtz instability modified by vegetation drag, whereas Mode 2 is unrelated to Kelvin-Helmholtz and arises from an interaction between the flow in the vegetated and unvegetated layers. The vegetation damping, according to our model, leads to a finite threshold flow for both these modes. Experimental observations for the onset and frequency of waving compare well with model predictions for the instability onset criteria and the imaginary part of the complex growth rate respectively, but experiments lie in a parameter regime where the two modes can not be distinguished. % The inclusion of vegetation drag differentiates our mechanism from the previous linear stability analyses of monami.

To evaluate the method, the recognition rates are bench marked against the results of the competitors who have participated in Opportunity challenge as well as the baseline results provided by the Opportunity group. For modes of locomotion, our results surpass all of the available results and in some cases the recognition rate of our model is very close to the highest recognition rate. For gestures, regular or noisy data,in some cases our method is still higher than baseline or challenge participants but unlike locomotion, it is not capable to beat them all...|$|R

40|$|We {{have used}} a {{combination}} of 2 D IR spectroscopy with 13 C= 18 O labeled amide-I and 15 N-labeled amide-II modes to reveal how vibrational coupling between labeled peptide units depends on secondary structure. Linear and 2 D IR measurements and simulations of Calpha,alpha-diethylglycine homotetrapeptide show that this compound adopts the fully extended (2. 05 -helical) conformation in CDCl 3, consistent with previous work on the Ac-capped peptide. The amide-I/II cross peaks of isotopomers exhibit only a marginal isotope frequency shift between <b>labeled</b> <b>modes</b> that are separated by two peptide units, indicating a very weak coupling. This result is in sharp contrast with a large cross-peak shift observed in 3 - 10 -helical peptides, in which the labeled amide-I and -II modes are connected through an inter-residue C=O [...] . H-N hydrogen bond. The discovered 3 D-structural dependence indicates that the 13 C= 18 O/ 15 N labeled amide-I/II cross peaks can distinguish {{the formation of a}} single 3 - 10 -helical turn from the fully extended polypeptide chain and increase the versatility of 2 D IR spectroscopy as a conformational analysis tool of biomolecules...|$|R
40|$|We give a {{description}} of the phenyl-ring-localized vibrational modes of the ground states of the para-disubstituted benzene molecules including both symmetric and asymmetric cases. In line with others, we quickly conclude that the use of Wilson <b>mode</b> <b>labels</b> is misleading and ambiguous; we conclude the same regarding the related ones of Varsányi. Instead we <b>label</b> the <b>modes</b> consistently based upon the Mulliken (Herzberg) method for the modes of para-difluorobenzene (pDFB). Since we wish the labelling scheme to cover both symmetrically- and asymmetrically-substituted molecules, we apply the Mulliken labelling under C 2 v symmetry. By studying the variation of the vibrational wavenumbers with mass of the substituent, we are able to identify the corresponding modes across a wide range of molecules and hence provide consistent assignments. Particularly interesting are pairs of vibrations that evolve from in- and out-of-phase motions in pDFB to more localized modes in asymmetric molecules. We consider the para isomers of the following: the symmetric dihalobenzenes, xylene, hydroquinone, the asymmetric dihalobenzenes, halotoluenes, halophenols and cresol...|$|R
