The project {{was part of the}} state-coupled US Department of Energy Geothermal Program. Richardson Well Drilling of Tacoma, Washington was subcontracted through the State to perform the work. The general <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> areas are shown in figure 1. The first hole, DNR 83 - 1, was located within the Green River valley northwest of Mount St. Helens. This site is near the Green River Soda Springs and along the projection of the Mount St. Helens [...] Elk Lake seismic zone. The other two holes were drilled near Mount Baker. Hole DNR 83 - 3 was sited about 1 / 4 km west of the Baker Hot Springs, 10. 5 km east of Mount Baker, while hole DNR 83 - 5 was located along Rocky Creek in the Sulphur Creek Valley. The Rocky Creek hole is about 10 km south-southwest of the peak. Two other holes, DNR 83 - 2 and DNR 83 - 4, were located {{on the north side of}} the Sulphur Creek Valley. Both holes were abandoned at early stages of drilling because of deep overburden and severe caving problems. The sites were apparently located atop old landslide deposits...|$|E

They {{will only be}} forth coming if services provided by project have more direct effect for those who use the services. However the effects of health programs might be direct or indirect {{so that they are}} difficult to be measured comparing with other sectors. The study team conducted a study on Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation (BME) by using The Rural Health and Population Project (ADB Ill-Loan No. 1299 -lno) as objective of the study. The study was conducted in the year 2000, however, {{the results of this study}} is relevant to be published due to it is difficult to find the references, which showed the experiences of the BME study in the health sector. The prime objective of the Rural Health and Population Project was to assist the Government in raising the health status of the population and reducing total fertility rates through the improvement of quality, relevance, efficiency and effectiveness of community-based rural health and family planning (FP) delivery system. The Project adopted the following three strategic initiatives: (1) to change the role and orientation of the district hospital; (2) to improve community-based rural health, nutrition and FP service delivery and capabilities; and (3) to strengthen the organization and management at district level. To examine the extent, to which these reforms through the project implementation have intended benefits and effects, both individually and collectively, the evaluation team conducted a study to evaluate the progress on the field implementation of these reforms in the area of the project. The evaluation  of benefits of projects will be conducted, whether or not the benchmarks of benefit monitoring was adequately documented when the project is prepared. The study team using a conceptual  model called a Logical Framework (LF) a set of cause-and-effect relationship through which resources provided through the project are transformed so they contribute to achieving the objective of the intervention, and assumptions about external factors which affect these relationships.  ALF enables one to describe a project in terms of three sequential relationships: inputs to outputs, outputs to effects and effects to impact. Assessment was used benchmark that information available in the project documents. Addition primary and secondary data needed was collected in the <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project.</b> The study identified three group or stakeholders which have benefits of the projects; (1) the local authority; (2) The health provider; (3) the community or recipients. By using the benchmark which available in the regularly reporting and recording system the benefits of the project was assessed as; (1) no benefit; (2 } minimal benefit; (3) and optimal benefit. Results of the study showed that (1) the local authority in general have optimal benefit, however several activities have minimal benefits; (2) the health providers have minimal benefit, some showed have no benefit, it is only improvement of medical services have an optimal benefit; (3) the community or recipients almost have optimal benefit. <br /...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Proje saha yönetiminin en önemli aşamalarından birisi gerçekleştirilen imalatların işveren ve kalite kontrol kriterlerine uygunluğunun denetlenmesidir. Bu bağlamda projede görev alan firma personelleri hiyerarşik bir yapılanma içerisinde yapım projesinin her bir mahalinde tüm iş kalemleri için saha imalat kontrollerini gerçekleştirmektedirler. Geleneksel anlamda hem küresel çapta hem de Türkiye ‘de veri yönetimi evrak tabanlı formlar üzerinden yürütülmektedir. Özellikle iş kalemi ve mahal sayısı bakımından zengin olan orta ve büyük ölçekli yapım projelerinde evrak tabanlı bu formların sayısı binler ile ifade edilebilmektedir. Evrak sayısının fazla olması özellikle veri yönetiminde güçlük, ağır doküman yükü, veri kayıpları, raporlama ve geri bildirim sürelerinde uzamalar gibi problemleri beraberinde getirmektedir. Çalışma kapsamında saha imalat kontrollerinde tespit edilen problemleri çözmeyi hedefleyen Taşınabilir Aygıt Saha Kontrol (TASK) modeli önerilmiştir. Önerilen model oluşturulurken günümüz bilişim teknolojileri yoğun olarak kullanılmış ve iki adet prototip geliştirilmiştir. Bunlardan ilki saha imalat kontrollerini yerinde gerçekleştirmeyi mümkün kılan Android işletim sistemli taşınabilir cihazlarda kullanılması düşünülen Prototip I yazılımıdır. Diğeri ise yapım projesinin şantiye ve teknik ofislerinde imalat takip ve raporlama işlemleri için Windows işletim sistemli bilgisayarlarda kullanılmak üzere geliştirilen Prototip II yazılımıdır.   Android işletim sistemi üzerinde çalışan Prototip I yazılımı ile saha imalat kontrollerinde sıklıkla kullanılan kâğıt tabanlı iş teslim ve kalite kontrol formları dijital platformda oluşturulmuştur. İmalat kontrolleri neticesinde ortaya çıkan veriler projenin herhangi bir aşamasında anlık erişim sağlanmak üzere ağ tabanlı TASK modeli ortak veritabanında depolanmıştır. Depolanan veriler Windows işletim sistemini kullanan Prototip II tarafından işlenerek gerekli raporlamalar anlık olarak oluşturulabilmiştir. Allplan, Revit ve ArchiCAD gibi BIM (Yapı Bilgi Modellemesi) uygulamalarından alınan yapım projesine ait IFC uzantılı dosyalar Prototip II içerisine entegre edilerek iş teslimleri üç boyutlu ortamda görselleştirilebilmiştir. Geliştirilen modelin süre etkinliğini ölçmek adına çalışma kapsamında doğrulama analizi gerçekleştirilmiştir. Doğrulama analizinde, geleneksel saha imalat kontrollerinden alınan örneklemler ile TASK modelinden alınan örneklemler çok yönlü olarak değerlendirilmiş ve TASK modeli ile etkin sonuçlar alındığı tespit edilmiştir. One of {{the most}} crucial stages of {{construction}} field management is to inspect conformity of completed work items according to quality control and employer work acceptance criteria. In this scope, field inspections are carried out for each individual location and for all work items existing in the construction project by companies’ staff in a hierarchical manner. Traditionally, data management is carried out through paper-based sheets. Especially in medium to large scale construction projects, number of paper-based inspection sheets can be stated in thousands. In such cases, excessive amount of control documents bring in data management and site tracking problems which, in return, cause data loss, reporting and feedback delays. These problems have been discussed in many researches and tools {{have been developed to}} amend site inspection efficiency. Most of the solutions, which were proposed by researchers to overcome site inspection problems, took advantage of information technologies. Earlier models suggested that Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) could be used to inspect work items and materials at construction field. Thus, related reports regarding defected work items and materials could be created and corrective actions could be taken. Recent models, on the other hand, suggested that site inspections could be made via mobile devices operating on IOS and Android platforms. With suggested models, work defects could be detected and related notifications could be sent to subcontractor for corrective actions. Despite the fact that these models obtained successful results in defect management, site inspections were not carried out for all work items at every location of the construction project regarding work acceptance criteria determined by the employer. In addition, it is observed that {{there is a lack of}} integrity between Building Information Modelling (BIM) and site inspections, so that results obtained from site inspections can be visualized in 3 D IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) models of the building. In the scope of this study, Mobile Device Field Inspection (TASK) model is proposed to overcome mentioned site inspection problems and fill the gap in the literature. While developing TASK model, modern-day information technologies were used extensively and two software have been developed in the process, which were named as Prototype I, and Prototype II. Prototype I software was developed with JAVA programming language for Android based mobile devices, so that site inspections could be carried out at construction field. Prototype II software, on the other hand, was developed with C# programming language for Windows based computers, so that progress and conformity reports could be generated by processing data obtained from site inspections. In addition to reporting, IFC extension file, which is exported from BIM model of the building, can be imported into Prototype II and site inspection progress can be visualized in three-dimensional environment. Main purpose of the TASK model is to manage site inspection activities with mobile devices and generate related reports at any stage of the construction project instantaneously by preventing data loss and feedback delays. Thus, problems encountered in traditional paper-based site inspection models could be minimized and intercommunication between employer and subcontractors could be improved. To be able to achieve this objective, a shared MySQL database, which was located in a web server, has been included inside TASK model. Thus, data created with site inspections could be stored and related reports could be generated in both of the prototypes. Communication between prototypes and shared database have been established by the help of PHP scripts, which also handle logical operations for TASK model database management. TASK model stages can be divided into four main components, which are (1) system data input, (2) BIM integration, (3) site inspections and (4) reporting. System data input is the first stage of the TASK model. System data can be defined as project-based information, which is going to be utilized at site inspections. This includes project locations, work items, quality control acceptance criteria, companies, company users, drawings, contracts, technical specifications etc. System administrator of the TASK model, who is an individual authorized by the employer, inputs these data into TASK model shared database with the help of either Prototype I or Prototype II modules prior to initiation of the construction project. While data entry, system administrator links project locations with work items and determines quality control acceptance criteria of each work item. Thus, when construction project initiates, related data is viewed by quality control engineers and related acceptance status can be marked on digital work delivery forms. Within the scope of this study, system data entry of project locations was automated with Prototype II. IFC files exported from BIM applications can be imported into 3 D IFC module of Prototype II and project locations existing in the BIM model can be inserted into TASK model shared database automatically. Second stage of the TASK model is to provide integrity between BIM and site inspections. If location based system data was inserted into TASK model shared database via 3 D IFC model of the Prototype II, site inspection and BIM model integrity can be established with TASK model. At any stage of the construction project, TASK model users can select related work items and view site inspection acceptance status of the whole construction project in a three dimensional environment. After selecting related work item, locations where work item is in conformity status are colored with green color and where work item is in hold or non-conformity status are colored with red color. Thus, subcontractors and employer will have a visual understanding of the current site inspection status at any stage of the construction project. Third stage of the TASK model is to carry out site inspections on digital quality control and delivery forms by the help of Prototype I, which operates on mobile Android operating system. System data, which is inserted into TASK database by system administrator, is processed by Prototype I and digital quality control forms are created on mobile device. TASK users from both subcontractor and employer companies carry out site inspections of work items at related <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> with their mobile devices in a hierarchical manner. Employer acceptance criteria items are viewed on Prototype I and conformities with related items for the completed work are determined. Items, which confirm employer acceptance criteria, are marked as “accepted”, and items, which do not confirm related criteria, are marked as “rejected”. For rejected items, Prototype I sends related notifications to subcontractor, which is at the very bottom of the project organizational hierarchy, for corrective actions to be taken. For accepted items, Prototype I sends related notifications to users, who work for the upper level company inside the project organizational hierarchy.   In site inspection stage of the TASK model, drawings and technical specifications, which are uploaded to TASK model FTP server by system administrator, can be viewed on mobile devices with the help of Prototype I. In addition, photographs can be taken with Prototype I for defected work items. Thus, other TASK users can have a deeper understanding of the work item nonconformities. Also, TASK users can comment on work items, where they have encountered nonconformities that are not included in employer acceptance requirements. When site inspection is completed, Prototype I stores related data in TASK database while notifying TASK users in a hierarchical manner. Last stage of TASK model is to create reports regarding data obtained from site inspections. At any stage of the construction process, reports can be generated on both of the prototypes instantly. Reports mainly consist of conformity status of all work items at each location of the project. These reports help understanding quality control acceptance progress of the project. Therefore, data generated inside these reports can be shared with different departments of the companies for progress payments or cost monitoring. Especially, thanks to flexible structure of reporting module inside Prototype II, different reports can be created in accordance with company needs.   To be able to measure time effectiveness of the TASK model, a verification analysis was conducted. In the analysis, site inspection activity was divided into nine steps from system data input to reporting. For each step, time samples from both traditional site inspections and TASK model were collected and related comparisons were made. It was observed that TASK model, when compared to traditional site inspections, provided better results in terms of time efficiency. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
