40|$|The BRANCO {{event was}} detonated in hole U 2 ew of the Nevada Test Site as {{indicated}} in figure 1. 1. The event HERKIMER was simultaneously detonated at a greater depth in the same hole. The BRANCO device had a depth-of-burial (DOB) of 293 m in the alluvium of area 2, about 250 m above the standing water level and 670 m above the Paleozoic formation. Stemming of the 2. 44 m diameter emplacement hole followed the plan is shown, and a log of the stemming operations was maintained. Detonation time was 09 : 25 PDT on September 21 1983, and 88. 7 minutes later a surface collapse occurred leaving a crater with mean radius of 55. 8 m and maximum depth of 9. 7 m. No radiation arrivals were detected above ground and the BRANCO containment was considered successful. A schematic layout of the instrumentation designed to monitor the emplacement procedures and stemming performance of the BRANCO event is provided. The two stemming plugs above the BRANCO event were composed of coal-tar epoxy (LAE 59, denoted CTE).

30|$|The Vancouver {{classification}} of periprosthetic fractures {{of the hip}} [4, 5] is considered a reliable system for grading these fractures {{as well as for}} guiding treatment decisions. In particular, the Vancouver classification helps distinguish stable from unstable fractures requiring fixation as well as stable from unstable implants requiring revision. Fractures involving the trochanteric area are categorized as type A (Ag and Al for the greater and lesser trochanter, respectively), fractures about the stem or tip of the implant are type B, and fractures distal to the tip of the stem are type C. Type B fractures are further divided into subtype B 1 when adjacent to a well fixed stem, B 2 in presence of a <b>loose</b> <b>stem,</b> and B 3 when associated with marked osteopenia or loss of bone substance. According to this classification system, most of these fractures require surgical treatment.|$|R

40|$|Background: Currently, an {{algorithmic}} {{approach for}} deciding treatment options {{according to the}} Vancouver classification is wide-ly used for treatment of periprosthetic femoral fractures after hip arthroplasty. However, this treatment algorithm based on the Vancouver classification lacks consideration of patient physiology and surgeon’s experience (judgment), which are also important for deciding treatment options. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the treatment results and discuss the treatment options using a case series. Methods: Eighteen consecutive cases with periprosthetic femoral fractures after total hip arthroplasty and hemiarthroplasty were retrospectively reviewed. A locking compression plate system was used for osteosynthesis during the study period. The fracture type was determined by the Vancouver classification. The treatment algorithm based on the Vancouver classification was gener-ally applied, but was modified in some cases according to the surgeon’s judgment. The reasons for modification of the treatment algorithm were investigated. Mobility status, ambulatory status, and social status were assessed before the fracture and at the latest follow-up. Radiological results including bony union and stem stability were also evaluated. Results: Thirteen cases were treated by osteosynthesis, two by revision arthroplasty and three by conservative treatment.

In our study, 17 of 25 consecutive osteo-arthritic patients with aseptically <b>loose</b> <b>stems</b> who underwent first-time revision using impacted morsellised allograft bone and a cemented Exeter stem were followed by yearly radiostereometric examinations for nine years. The mean subsidence at six weeks was 1. 1 mm (0. 1 to 2. 3), from six weeks to one year 1. 3 mm (0 to 2. 6), from one to five years 0. 7 mm (0 to 2. 0), and from five to nine years 0. 7 mm (0. 1 to 3. 1). That from six weeks to nine years was 2. 7 mm (0 to 6. 4) (95 % confidence interval 2. 0 to 3. 5). The Charnley pain score significantly improved after revision, and was maintained at nine years, but walking ability deteriorated slightly as follow-up extended.

We developed and studied a new prosthesis design that features an intramedullary anchorage system for which finite element analysis predicted favorable bone remodeling. We retrospectively analyzed the cases of all patients who underwent implantation of the new stem. Their data were prospectively collected. Twenty-four patients (25 prosthetic reconstructions using diaphyseal fixation of the prosthesis) had 18 primary implantations and 7 revision cases. At a mean follow- up of 61 months, TESS (Toronto Extremity Salvage Score) and MSTS (Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Rating Scale score) were 80 % and 65 % that of a normal extremity, respectively.

Our aim was to confirm or refute the predictions of a previous roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis study in which 20 % of the Charnley Elite-Plus stems had shown rapid posterior head migration. It was predicted that this device would have a high early rate of failure. We examined 118 patients at a mean of nine years after hip replacement, including the 19 patients from the original roentgen stereophotogrammetric study. The number of revision procedures was recorded and clinical and radiological examinations were performed. The rate of survival of the femoral stems at ten years was 83 % when revision alone {{was considered to be}} a failure. It decreased to 59 % when a radiologically <b>loose</b> <b>stem</b> was also considered to be a failure. All the patients previously shown in the roentgen stereophotogrammetric study to have high posterior head migration went on to failure. There was a highly significant difference (p = 0. 002) in posterior head migration measured at two years after operation between failed and non-failed femoral stems, but {{there was no significant difference}} in subsidence between these two groups. Our study has shown that the Charnley Elite-Plus femoral component has an unacceptably high rate of failure. It confirms that early evaluation of new components is important and that roentgen stereophotogrammetric is a good tool for this.

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the demographics, incidence, and results of treatment of periprosthetic fractures in a nationwide observational study. Methods: In the years 1999 and 2000, 321 periprosthetic fractures were reported to the Swedish National Hip Ar-throplasty Register. All of the associated hospital records were collected. At the time of follow-up, the Harris hip score, a health-related quality-of-life measure (the EuroQol- 5 D [EQ- 5 D] index), and patient satisfaction were used as outcome measurements. A radiologist performed the radiographic evaluation. Results: Ninety-one patients, with a mean age of 73. 8 years, sustained a fracture after one or several revision proce-dures, and 230 patients, with a mean age of 77. 9 years, sustained a fracture after a primary total hip replacement. Minor trauma, including a fall to the floor, and a spontaneous fracture were the main etiologies for the injuries. A high number of patients had a <b>loose</b> <b>stem</b> at the time of the fracture (66 % in the primary replacement group and 51 % in the revision group). Eighty-eight percent of the fractures were classified as Vancouver type B; however, there was diffi-culty with preoperative categorization of the fractures radiographically. There was a high failure rate resulting in a low short to mid-term prosthetic survival rate. The sixty-six-month survival rate for the entire fracture group, with reopera-tion as the end point, was 74. 8 % ± 5. 0 %. One factor associated with fracture risk was implant design.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of loosening in {{total hip arthroplasty}} (THA) {{and the role of}} polyethylene (PE) wear debris in this process is unclear. Radiographic measurements showed that THA with 32 mm heads have about 3 times greater volumetric wear than those with 22 mm heads. If PE debris were the main cause of loosening, then there should be an obvious difference in revision rates between the prostheses with these two head sizes. However, the analysis of revision rates, due to aseptic loosening, showed no significant difference. These findings do not support the hypothesis that wear debris is the main cause of loosening. The intracapsular pressure and ultrasonographic synovitis in THA with loose components was studied. The pressure was high and with cyclic alterations dependent on hip joint movements. The synovitis in loose THA was more pronounced than in stable ones. There was a significant correlation between the intracapsular pressure with the hip in extension with inward rotation and synovitis. These results suggest that increased pressure and synovitis is important in loosening of THA. The correlation between synovitis, wear and radiographic loosening was studied. There was a significant correlation between volumetric wear and synovitis. Hips with cup loosening had significantly greater wear and synovitis than the others. In THA with loose cups the PE wear was higher than in those with <b>loose</b> <b>stems.</b> This indicates that PE debris is of certain importance in loosening of acetabular components, but of less significance in loosening of stems. The experimental study showed that bone cement, if left inside PE cups during curing, contaminates the articulating surface of the cups with cement debris. In clinical situations such contamination may predispose to increased wear...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{incidence}} of femur fracture around total hip arthroplasties {{continues to increase}} at substantial cost to society. These fractures are frequently associated with a loose femoral component. Consequently, we sought to test whether femoral component loosening predisposes to periprosthetic femoral fracture. Because many peripros-thetic femoral fractures are spiral in nature, we evaluated the torsional characteristics of the implanted femur in which the only design variable was instability of the fem-oral component. We used synthetic (polyurethane) (n = 15) and paired cadaveric femora (n = 10) with specimens divided into two groups: well-fixed and <b>loose</b> cemented <b>stems.</b> Each specimen was tested mechanically in internal rotation until failure. For the synthetic speci-mens, torque to failure was reduced by 38 %, whereas stiffness was decreased 54 % for the loose group compared with the well-fixed group. For the cadaveric specimens, torque to failure was reduced by 58 %, whereas stiffness decreased 70 % for the loose group compared with the well-fixed group. Fracture patterns were similar between syn-thetic and cadaveric femora with a proximal spiral pattern in loose specimens and more distal fracture patterns with well-fixed stems. Based on our data, patients with loosened femoral components {{are at risk for}} fracture at a substan-tially lower torque than those with well-fixed components...|$|R

40|$|Background: We {{reviewed}} a consecutive {{series of}} patients with a humeral fracture around either an anatomic or a reverse shoulder prosthesis treated with either open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) or revision shoulder arthro-plasty. The purposes {{of the study were}} to (1) describe the treatment of these fractures by either method, (2) report the outcomes, and (3) assess the validity of a current classification system. Methods: Indications for surgery were a displaced unstable fracture, a fracture around a <b>loose</b> humeral <b>stem,</b> or a patient who was unable to tolerate conservative treatment. Outcomes were reported for two groups (patients treated with revision arthroplasty and those treated only with ORIF) and included American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores, radiographic evidence of fracture union, and complications. Results: The mean ASES score for the entire cohort was 50. 3 (95 % confidence interval: 41. 2 to 59. 5). Thirty-five of the thirty-six fractures healed, in a mean of 7. 2 months (range, 3. 25 to 13. 5 months). Complications occurred in fourteen (39 %) of the thirty-six patients.

40|$|Post-operative periprosthetic femur {{fracture}} is {{a severe}} complication after {{total hip arthroplasty}} (THA). The incidence of periprosthetic femur fractures seems to be increasing because of several factors,including a growing population with THAs and an increasing life expectancy. Furthermore, after fourdecades of THA surgery, {{the number of patients}} with revised THAs has also risen. Periprosthetic femurfracture is more common after revision surgery. The overall aim was to study the postoperative/late periprosthetic femur fracture in a nationwideprospective study and to estimate the national incidence. Other aims of this study were: 1. To identifypatient related risk factors associated with sustaining a late periprosthetic femur fracture. 2. To identifyimplant related risk factors associated with sustaining a periprosthetic femur fracture. 3. To evaluatepatient related outcome after treatment of a periprosthetic fracture by the use of generic and diseasespecificinstruments. 4. To describe the treatment and analyze failure rate using the need of further surgeryas failure endpoint definition. 5. To identify implant and patient related risk factors associated with failureof treatment for a periprosthetic fracture. The Swedish National Hip Arthroplasty Register is a unique instrument concerning studies ofuncommon complications after THA surgery. The current study is, to our knowledge, the largest reportedmaterial (1, 049) of postoperative/late periprosthetic femur fractures. The annual incidence ofperiprosthetic femur fracture varied between 0. 045 % and 0. 13 %, and increased {{towards the end of the}} studyperiod. Between 1979 and 2000, 1, 049 periprosthetic femur fractures were reported to The Swedish NationalHip Arthroplasty Register. We analyzed the correlation to diagnosis, gender, implant type, stem fixation,and time interval from index operation to fracture. Patients operated from 1999 to 2000 (321) werefollowed prospectively. A clinical follow-up was done (mean 2. 5 years) at each local hospital and a Registryfollow-up (mean 5 years) with re-operation as an endpoint was performed. By use of the Poissonregression model we identified risk factors associated with periprosthetic fracture and risk factorsassociated to failure. A majority of the patients had a <b>loose</b> <b>stem</b> at the time of fracture. These findings stress theimportance of longitudinal clinical and radiographic follow-up of patients operated on with a THA. Female gender and osteoarthritis were associated with a decreased risk while age, rheumatoid arthritis andhip fracture had an increased risk for sustaining a periprosthetic fracture. In the revised group thestrongest predictor was the number of revisions performed before the fracture. The anatomically shapedLubinus SP II prosthesis had a significantly decreased risk, and patients with the Charnley or the Exeterprostheses had significantly increased risk for periprosthetic fracture. Patients operated for a periprosthetic femur fracture had on average a poor clinical outcome at 2. 5 years follow-up both concerning the health related quality of life and the hip specific assessment. Highfrequencies of major complications and re-operations were found. Approximately every fifth patient wasin need of further surgery during the study period and 50 % of them were re-operated on within 12 months post-operatively.

40|$|Israel Kirzner {{has been}} one of the leaders in {{fashioning}} an Austrian school of economics. In his rendering of the Austrian school, one finds a marriage between Friedrich Hayek’s discourse with Ludwig von Mises’s deductive, praxeological image of science — a marriage that seems to us somewhat forced. The Misesian image of science stakes its claims to scientific status on purported axioms and categorical, 100 -percent deductive truths, as well as the supposed avoidance of any looseness in evaluative judgments. In keeping with the praxeological style of discourse, Kirzner claims that his notion of coordination can be used as a clear-cut criterion of economic goodness. Kirzner wishes to claim that gainful entrepreneurial action in the market is always coordinative. We contend that Kirzner’s efforts to be categorical and to avoid looseness are unsuccessful. We argue that looseness inheres in the economic discussion of the most important things, and associate that viewpoint with Adam Smith. We suggest that Hayek is much closer to Smith than to Mises, and that Kirzner’s invocations of Hayek’s discussions of coordination are spurious. In denying looseness and trying to cope with the brittleness of categorical claims, Kirzner becomes abstruse. His discourse erupts with problems. Kirzner has erred in rejecting the understanding of coordination held by Hayek, Ronald Coase, and their contemporaries in the field at large. Kirzner’s refraining from the <b>looser</b> Smithian perspective <b>stems</b> from his devotion to Misesianism. Beyond all the criticism, however, we affirm the basic thrust of what Kirzner says about economic processes. Once we give up the claim that voluntary profitable activity is always or necessarily coordinative, and once we make peace with the aesthetic aspect of the idea of concatenate coordination, the basic claims of Kirzner can be salvaged: Voluntary profitable activity is usually coordinative, and government intervention is usually discoordinative. But the Misesian image of science must be dropped. coordination; concatenation; discovery; entrepreneurship;...|$|R

[...] O Faith! if thou art strong, thine opposite [...] Is mighty also, and the dull fool's sneer [...] Hath ofttimes shot chill palsy through the arm, [...] Just lifted to achieve its crowning deed, [...] And made the firm-based heart, that would have quailed [...] The rack or fagot, shudder like a leaf [...] Wrinkled with frost, and <b>loose</b> upon its <b>stem.</b> [...] The wicked and the weak, by some dark law, [...] Have a strange power to shut and rivet down [...] Their own horizon round us, to unwing [...] Our heaven-aspiring visions, and to blur [...] With surly clouds the Future's gleaming peaks, [...] Far seen across the brine of thankless years. [...] If the chosen soul could never be alone [...] In deep mid-silence, open-doored to God, [...] No greatness ever had been dreamed or done; [...] Among dull hearts a prophet never grew; [...] The nurse of full-grown souls is solitude.|$|R
