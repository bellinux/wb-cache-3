40|$|The lock {{complex at}} Terneuzen {{is the main}} {{entrance}} for ships coming from the Westerscheld and navigating towards the cities of Terneuzen and Ghent. The {{construction of a new}} large lock at the lock complex of Terneuzen is planned to increase its capacity. This lock will be built between the existing locks. The ground level is situated at NAP + 6 meter. The minimum normative sea water level occurring twice a year is NAP - 2. 85 meter. The new lock will have larger dimensions than the current locks. It is assumed that a ship with a draft of 13. 1 meter must {{be able to use the}} lock tide independently. Because of the large allowable draft the lock must be founded to a depth of NAP - 17. 26 m. It is becoming increasingly difficult to construct the new lock with traditional building methods like combi– or diaphragm walls to such extent. In this master thesis the use of pneumatic caissons as alternative construction method for the new lock in Terneuzen has been elaborated. Pneumatic caissons have been used for many times as construction method. However, pneumatic caissons have never been used with the dimensions required for the new <b>lock</b> <b>head.</b> (l = 132 m, w = 45 m & h = 33 m) The pneumatic caisson method involves the construction of a relative rigid concrete box at ground level that is lowered into the ground by excavating the soil underneath it. Under the bottom slab of a pneumatic caisson an air-pressurized space, called the working chamber, is present which is made up of tapering walls around the perimeter of the caisson base slab. These tapering walls are called the cutting edges of the caisson. The working chamber is kept dry by the presence of air pressure. Due to the air pressure, groundwater is not able to enter the working chamber. The deeper the caisson is located below the water table, the higher the air pressure should be. In this master thesis two construction alternatives for the lock heads with help of pneumatic caissons are elaborated: 1. The construction of one large pneumatic caisson with a length of 132 meter, width of 45 meter and a height of 33 meter containing the complete <b>lock</b> <b>head</b> including the gate chamber and gate recess. The working chamber is divided into 14 compartments. 2. The construction of two (compartmentalized–) pneumatic caissons which can be subsided independently. One caisson with a length of 10 meter, width of 45 meter and a height of 33 meter is covering the gate recess and the other caisson with a length of 67 meter, width of 45 meter and a height of 33 meter is covering the gate chamber. Between the pneumatic caisson an immersible caisson is located. This caisson acts as foundation for the guiding rail and moving equipment and prevents piping below the lock gates. With help of SCIA Engineer, a software package for structural calculations, the structural feasibility of the caisson is analysed and worked out. Due to the lack of bending and torsional stiffness in the first construction alternative the occurring forces and moments are up to 2 times larger in comparison to the second construction alternative. The use of pneumatic caissons to construct the <b>lock</b> <b>head</b> has some advantages over the use of a traditional building pit. The building time of 22 months is 8 months shorter in duration compared with the building pit and the building costs are with respectively Euro 48. 300. 000 and Euro 37. 700. 000 much lower than the building costs of a building pit which is estimated at Euro 52. 600. 000. Moreover the pneumatic caissons can be constructed in controlled conditions above the surface level. Despite of the advantages the construction method has a large number of disadvantages. Different conclusions can be drawn up. Some conclusions are in favor of the construction with pneumatic caisson. On the other hand the construction method has some important disadvantages that can not be neglected. A considerably large working space is required for the sedimentation basin and bentonite de-sanding installation during subsidence of the caisson(s). The possibility of rotation of the caisson during subsidence and working under an overpressure increase the associated risks. It should be taken into account that about 50 % of the surface area of the bottom slab must be reinforced against shear. Also a large amount of bending reinforcement (101 kg=m 3 – 219 kg=m 3) is required. Moreover there is less practical experience with the construction of pneumatic caissons. A comparison between the options on feasibility, safety, risk, required materials, building time and costs shows that the reference design, the use of a traditional building pit to construct the <b>lock</b> <b>head,</b> is the best conceivable option.

40|$|In general, an inland {{navigation}} lock has a structural lifespan of about 100 years, while {{in most cases}} this lock is not big enough anymore after 25 - 50 years. This {{is caused by the}} growing ship dimensions and/or intensities. A functional flexible lock is the solution for extending the functional lifespan. This type of lock is, with or without a few structural adjustments, capable of serving the shipping traffic for its whole structural lifespan. This design approach will be applied on the lock complex ‘Sluis Sambeek’, which is located in the Meuse route. The first part of the study is carried out {{on the basis of the}} Life Cycle Management (LCM) approach. The LCM is started with a trend forecast, from which follows that the future ship sizes are normative for the required lock dimensions. After that, three alternatives are elaborated: 1. Zero-alternative: renovation of the lock. 2. Functional flexible lock: standard lock that is built large enough at once. 3. Structural flexible lock: a relatively easy extendable navigation lock. The maximum dimensions are reached stepwise. Alternative 2 appears to be the least expensive option for ‘Sluis Sambeek’. Although alternative 3 is the most expensive option, this alternative is elaborated further, because it is the most innovative option and could be a better solution for another lock reconstruction. The structural flexibility in alternative 3 is formed by the lock chamber which exists of relatively simple replaceable sheet pile walls, and by floatable lock heads that can be replaced by wider lock heads. The construction planning and the structural <b>lock</b> <b>head</b> design are the innovative parts that are elaborated most specifically. It is concluded that it is useful to consider both the possibilities of a functional and a structural flexible lock design for ‘Sluis Sambeek’ or for another lock location.

40|$|This master thesis {{researches}} {{the necessity}} and possibilities of new/innovative lock gate technologies for future large & high head locks, like the Panama Canal Expansion Project. A historical data analysis has been performed, contemplates over 220 {{of the worlds}} largest locks throughout time, analyzing the development and application of conventional lock gate technologies. From this, the conclusions have been drawn that the required lock gate dimensions {{of a number of}} future projects, fall far outside the application area of current technologies, and that it may not be assumed that conventional technologies will lead to optimal solutions at this scale. In addition, a number of aspects will be highlighted for future large & high head lock gate design, especially reliability, water consumption and its effects on the locks accessibility. A new lock gate technology has been developed specifically attuned to the future dimensions and highlighted requirements resulting into the design of: ‘The Sliding Arch Gate’, an extremely slender gate design, using (tension) arch action to transfer loads to the <b>lock</b> <b>head</b> structure, minimizing recess dimensions and water consumption. In addition, the absence of submerged moving / mechanical parts, minimizes maintenance requirements and the modular design of the gate enhances ease of maintenance, transport and manufacture. The Sliding Arch Gate has been worked out to an operational design level, using the Panama Canal Expansion Project as reference, in order to evaluate its potential performance and to make comparison with conventional technologies. From the evaluation it has been concluded that Sliding Arch Gate will require higher initial investments but that major benefits are achieved by reduced water consumption and low maintenance. The first of which can result into over $ 2, 000 mln. in added revenues for the Panama Canal, during the commercial lifetime of the gate, due to increased lockage capacity. It has thus been concluded that new/innovative technologies, like the Sliding Arch Gate, can outperform up-scaled conventional technologies. However as the design of the Sliding Arch Gate is still in a pioneering stage, there are many optimizations to be found and uncertainties to be investigated.

40|$|The {{waterway}} axis Rhine/Meuse-Main-Danube crosses Europe transversally {{from the}} North Sea at Rotterdam to the Black Sea in Romania. This corridor {{is one of}} the longest ones in the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) and crosses both EU countries and non-Member States. In order to increase the transport capacity along this axis, many projects are supported by the Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency as part of the priority project 18. The increase of the lock capacity of the Meuse River in Belgium to reach class ECMT VIb, allowing the traffic of boats carrying up to 9, 000 tonnes, {{is one of the}}se projects. The new lock at Ampsin-Neuville will have a 225 m x 25 m chamber, with a 4. 70 m head. This lock will be built between an existing 136 m x 16 m lock and the weir. As the existing lock is equipped with lateral translation gates, these gates recesses constrain significantly the location of the new lock. Therefore, a through-the-head filling system has been preferred to the longitudinal culvert system selected for similar locks on the River Meuse. This paper focuses on the design of the upstream head of this new lock, equipped with short culverts and a dissipation chamber. In order to guide the design of this filling system, a scale model of the <b>lock</b> <b>head</b> has been set-up at the Hydraulics Research Laboratory of Walloon waterways administration. The specific aim of this model was to investigate different configurations of the conduit network and of the dissipation chamber in order to limit the hawser forces encountered by vessels in the lock chamber, through a reduction of waves and free-surface slopes in the lock itself, and a sufficient uniformity in flow distribution at the dissipation chamber outlet. A composite modelling approach has been used in conjunction with this physical model to optimise the design. The key parameter {{in the design of the}} dissipation chamber was the placement of energy and momentum dissipation devices. In order to guide this design, and to limit the number of tests in the scale model, 2 D numerical simulations of the flow inside the chamber were run in a variety of configurations such as e. g. longitudinal walls, square columns in aligned or staggered layout, round columns in aligned and staggered layouts. The best options were tested in the scale model. Head-losses and velocity distribution at the exit of the dissipation chamber were measured, for different combinations of upstream water level and discharge through the culverts, representative of different stages of the filling process. The measurements were finally compared with the predictions by the numerical models...|$|E
40|$|Ho Chi Minh City has to {{deal with}} severe {{flooding}} in the rainy season. To prevent the city from this flooding, MARD set up plan 1547. The main idea of the plan is to build a ring dike around HCMC in combination with several movable tidal barriers. One of these barriers is the Muong Chuoi Barrier. In this report a conceptual design of the Muong Chuoi Barrier is made. The structure consists of a movable tidal barrier and a navigation lock, both able to bear the water in both directions. The navigation lock provides a possibility of vessels passing when the barrier is closed. In the preliminary research information is gained about the location properties, the soil conditions, the hydraulic conditions and the shipping class, which results in a basis of design. An analysis of diffrent gate and foundation types give a number of possible alternatives. Vietnamese unit prices are investigated and used to make a proper cost estimation of the different alternatives. The most important requirements from the basis of design are: the normative high water level, the water discharge of the Muong Chuoi river, the shipping class, the number of vessels passing every day and minimum life span of the structure. After a selection between all the possible solutions, that follow from the preliminary research, four alternatives are worked out, which are a combination between two gate types, a lifting gate and a radial gate, and two foundation types, a caisson foundation and foundation with combi wall and underwater concrete. By means of structural calculations, the quantities of the materials used are determined. Based on these results and the unit prices from the preliminary research, a cost estimation of every alternative is made. In the multi criteria analysis for the barrier, the most important factor are the costs, its weighing factor is 50 %. Other criteria are: maintenance, constructability, usability and environmental impact. After the multi criteria analysis, the best alternative is alternative D, the radial gate in combination the combi wall foundation. The study of alternatives for the navigation lock focuses only on the <b>lock</b> <b>head.</b> Again a selection is made between the possible solutions that follow from the preliminary research. Four types are selected for the multi criteria analysis: mitre gates, single leaf gates, lifting gates and rolling or sliding gates. One of the most important criteria for the navigation lock are cost (35 %). Also the usability (35 %) is considered to be important, in particular the locking cycle and reliability. After the multi criteria analysis, the best alternative is the single leave gate. A conceptual design for the lock is created. The inner dimensions of the lock chamber are determined, the structural elements are designed and an structural calculation of the single leave gate is made.

40|$|In recent years, in {{a number}} of {{projects}} gate drive mechanisms of navigation locks were checked or adapted for a longer service life, during which the reliability, safety and availability of the structure had to be guaranteed for an extended period. Several problems were encountered. When verifying the gate drive mechanism, {{it was found that the}} drive mechanisms, which have performed well for years, do not meet the current design criteria. According to the current design criteria the capacity of the drive mechanism would be insufficient. The design force according to the latest criteria exceeds the maximum allowed force on the gate, and cannot be applied without major adaptations to the gate and <b>lock</b> <b>head</b> structure, hence, results in high costs. In coming years a series of approximately 50 locks require replacement or large scale maintenance, it is worth considering the apparent contradiction between drive mechanisms that performed satisfactorily for years against the much higher required capacities by the nowadays codes and guidelines, giving rise to the question; Is the approach as presented in the current codes and guidelines, in specific the ROK 1. 3 (Richtlijn Ontwerpen Kunstwerken, issued by Rijkswaterstaat), suitable for the design of drive mechanisms? This study presents a case study in order to answer this question. The case study focuses on a navigation lock containing Miter gates. The original design calculations dating from 1974 are compared to an updated calculation according to ROK 1. 3. Both calculations are subsequently compared to a more tailored calculation approach that accounts for site-specific forces. This third approach explained some of the key differences between the fully functioning drive mechanism with the capacity as designed in 1974 and the updated calculation applying ROK 1. 3. These differences primarily originate in the schematization of the forces affecting the drive mechanism and the resulting combination of forces. Applying the ROK 1. 3 resulted in a conservative estimation. Differences in order of magnitude are mostly explained by the adjusted regulations. In the past external forces were not accounted for in the calculations and the reliability requirements have become more stringent. Furthermore, operational requirements were not accounted for in the design phase. Navigation locks have the following main functions: navigation, water management and flood protection. Not defining properly which main function sets the safety requirement for the construction can result in a misjudgement of the loads that affect the navigation lock. ROK 1. 3 builds on principles and guidance for the different main functions separately, and these are not harmonized. The requirements for the different main functions relating the availability and structural reliability all translate into partial load factors that are aggregated into a reliability-index. Where one of the requirements leads to the normative reliability-index It is important to account for the different limit states when increasing availability of the system and, contrary to common practice in calculations for civil components, to increase the partial safety factors in the serviceability limit state. This will increase the safety mechanism of the system leading to higher availability. The regulations in ROK 1. 3 are useful in designing drive mechanisms as long as the main function that sets the safety constraint of the construction is taken into account. It is beneficial to include site-specific conditions and to estimate the load components more accurate. Although ROK 1. 3 does not explicitly discourage this approach, nor does it elaborate on it. At present another more sophisticated approach is not facilitated by the ROK. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesHydraulic Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The Netherlands are {{protected}} against extreme high waters {{from the sea}} by an ingenious system of barriers. One {{of the most famous}} ones is the Maeslant barrier in the New Waterway near the port of Rotterdam. This barrier however, is subject to discussion, as it might not function as intended, because of the following reasons. It has a very low reliability regarding closing. Furthermore, because of the sea level rise, it is expected that the barrier should close much more frequently, causing more nuisance for navigation. Therefore a different solution is put forward by Spaargaren c. s. Namely to close off the New Waterway permanently by means of a barrier, consisting out of a pumping station, dewatering sluice and a lock complex. The latter one is further elaborated on by making a feasibility study for it. First of all, the best location is chosen for the barrier, which in this report is the location near Rozenburg, just east of the Maeslant barrier. Because of the high demands regarding both navigation and flood safety in combination with the uncertainty in these demands for the future, {{there is a need for}} a sophisticated design for the lock complex. This is done by first considering the boundary conditions for different (initial and adaptive) scenarios for both sets of requirements (navigation and flood safety). For navigation a larger vessel is taken into account in the adaptive boundary conditions. For flood safety, the adaptive boundary conditions results in a higher water level of about 1 meter to be retained, mostly due to a larger sea level rise. It turns out that the boundary conditions regarding navigation have a way larger impact in the design choices of the lock complex than the boundary conditions regarding flood safety. The above boundary conditions are used to create an overall solution for the barrier. 4 locks are needed (in case of an initial design) : one large lock for large seagoing vessels, one mid-sized lock for smaller seagoing vessels and two for inland going vessels. When looking at the adaptive requirements, another mid-sized lock should be added. For the large lock, different principal solutions are developed that also take the adaptive boundary conditions into account. First of all, an adaptive design of a <b>lock</b> <b>head</b> is considered by making the head modular. This makes it possible to place a larger gate in the head later on. It turns out that this is probably not cost-efficient. The second proposed solution is to use a retaining wall in combination with a relieving floor for the chamber walls of the large lock for seagoing vessels. The relieving floor will decrease the horizontal soil loads on the soil retaining wall beneath it, which is structurally beneficial. This relieving floor will be combined with a longitudinal filling system. A longitudinal culvert over the length of the lock is placed on top of the relieving floor. Filling and emptying will be done using openings in the floor of the superstructure. The load on vessels during levelling of the lock are determined for this system, which is the main requirement that determines the filling time. It turns out that this option results in much faster levelling times compared to other levelling systems. Levelling could be done a factor 3 faster than filling through the head. It is concluded that the longitudinal culvert in combination with the relieving floor can compete with conventional filling systems. Furthermore, it fits in an adaptive design approach, because even with a wider lock, faster levelling times are possible. However, there are still some considerations to be made regarding this solution. A thorough cost-benefit analysis should be made. Besides of this, the hydraulic computations should be validated by means of a scale model or computational fluid dynamics.
