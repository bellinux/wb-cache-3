2500|$|During the 2004 {{election}} season, Frist {{employed the}} unprecedented political tactic {{of going to}} the home state of the opposition party's minority <b>leader,</b> Democrat <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle</b> of South Dakota, and actively campaigning against him. Daschle's Republican opponent, John Thune, defeated Daschle. In Daschle's farewell address, Frist arrived late. The two men have since found common ground and work together at the Bipartisan Policy Center and often speak together for healthcare conventions and events. After the 2004 elections, amid the controversy over Arlen Specter's post-election remarks, [...] Frist demanded a public statement from Specter to repudiate his earlier remarks and pledge support for Bush's judiciary nominees.

2500|$|In late October 2001, ABC chief investigative {{correspondent}} Brian Ross {{linked the}} anthrax sample to Saddam Hussein {{because of its}} purportedly containing the unusual additive bentonite. On October 26, Ross said, [...] "sources tell ABCNEWS the anthrax in the tainted letter sent to Senate Majority <b>Leader</b> <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle</b> was laced with bentonite. The potent additive {{is known to have}} been used by only one country in producing biochemical weapons—Iraq. ... t is a trademark of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's biological weapons program ... The discovery of bentonite came in an urgent series of tests conducted at Fort Detrick, Maryland, and elsewhere." [...] On October 28, Ross said that [...] "despite continued White House denials, four well-placed and separate sources have told ABC News that initial tests on the anthrax by the U.S. Army at Fort Detrick, Maryland, have detected trace amounts of the chemical additives bentonite and silica", a charge that was repeated several times on October 28 and 29.|$|E
2500|$|Presumably, Tatangelo {{meant that}} he had voted in Democratic {{primaries}} when he called himself a [...] "Democrat." [...] Records reveal, however, that Tatangelo has often supported and hosted Republican candidates, including the late President Ronald W. Reagan, with whom he once had a 45-minute audience to discuss border issues. KGNS-TV in Laredo reported {{at the time of}} Tatangelo's death that Tatangelo had wept when he learned of Reagan's death in 2004. Tatangelo also supported Presidents George Herbert Walker Bush and George W. Bush. In 2004, Tatangelo gave $750 to the Republican National Committee. Tatangelo gave $250 in 2004 to the campaign of former Republican U.S. Representative John Thune of South Dakota, who unseated Senate Democratic Minority <b>Leader</b> <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle.</b> When Tatangelo ran for county judge, then Webb County GOP chairman Esther Buckley {{a former member of the}} United States Commission on Civil Rights, endorsed Tatangelo and urged her fellow Republicans to write in his name on the ballot. Tatangelo secured Republican support not because of party, presumably, but because many had admired his challenge to the [...] "Old Party" [...] establishment and his desire to modernize the city while retaining its traditional values. Another Laredo Republican, businessman and former five-term city council member Joe A. Guerra, said that his friend Tatangelo was so open with the public that he would visit at his office or home with anyone, regardless of status, even without an appointment.|$|E
40|$|Brian Mann 2 ̆ 7 s Welcome to the Homeland weaves {{together}} astute {{observations of}} the American political system with a personalized journey into the oonservative base of American politics. Mann 2 ̆ 7 s thesis is that the political divisions in America can be best characterized by an urban versus rural divide that has evolved over the past eighty or so years. Mann refers to rural voters as homelanders who have increasingly turned to the Republican Party in pursuit of their version of an America with nineteenth-century traditional values. City folk, meanwhile, are dubbed metros, and their increasingly cosmopolitan, multiethnic, and secular world view has led them {{to turn to the}} Democratic Party. Unlike Thomas Frank in What 2 ̆ 7 s the Matter with Kansas?, Mann does not argue that the Republican Party is duping homelander voters by paying homage to traditional values. Instead, he outlines how the Republican Party strategy of building a rural base takes full advantage of the rural biases inherent in the design of American political institutions, including the Electoral College and the u. s. Senate, which disproportionately provide more relative political influence to low population states. Historically, the biased design advantaging small states mattered little, but the development of a two-party system with bases divided among rural versus urban voters has contributed to a divided polis. Mann also clearly outlines that homelanders do not maintain a 2 ̆ 2 false consciousness 2 ̆ 2 about economic issues, and they do hold Republican feet to the fire when their values are not pursued. Thus, Mann conceives of a homelander movement that seeks to take back American politics, largely through controlling the Republican Party, but also Democrats with the right stripes. Indeed, major players in the Democratic Party have and still do depend on homelander support (e. g., Senate <b>leaders</b> <b>Tom</b> <b>Daschle</b> and Harry Reid) ...|$|R
