It is thought that the site was occupied into the era of Roman Britain, and the area continued {{to be part of the}} Wealden iron industry until its demise in the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century.</b> An iron forge remains in the grounds of Bayham Abbey, in use until 1575 and documented until 1714.|$|E

5|$|After the Glorious Revolution, Wright, a Jacobite, {{fell out}} of favour at the royal court. The Flemish-Spanish painter John Baptist Medina (1659–1710) came to Scotland in 1693 and became the leading Scottish {{portrait}} painter of his generation. Among his best known works are {{a group of about}} 30 oval bust-lengths, including a self-portrait, in Surgeons' Hall, Edinburgh. He trained his son, also John, and William Aikman (1682–1731), who became the leading Scottish portrait-painter of the next generation. Aikman migrated to London in 1723, and from this point until the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century,</b> most Scottish painters of note followed him.|$|E

40|$|International audienceChurch {{discipline}} and the Reformed consistory, whether in Hungary, the Swiss world, France, The Netherlands or the British Isles, {{have become the}} subject of intense scholarly discussion. The fifteen essays gathered in this volume examine the process of censure and excommunication across Europe from the mid-sixteenth through the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>centuries.</b> They reevaluate the relationship of women to ecclesiastical authority and explore the complex ways in which exclusion from the Lord’s Supper operated. Several contributors trace the decrease in excommunication over time; others underscore national differences in its nature and the surprising infrequency of application. Together, they offer a fresh, unanticipated and illuminating portrait of the reform of morals associated with John Calvin and his followers...|$|R
5|$|Away {{from the}} wall, Roman sculptures include the marble {{head of a}} Roman emperor or general, broken from a larger statue, which was found at Hawkshaw, Peebleshire in the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century.</b> It dates to the second century CE {{and may have been}} looted from a Roman {{monument}} further to the south. The Cramond Lioness is a sculpture, probably imported, of a lioness devouring a bound prisoner, found near the Roman base of Cramond Roman Fort near Edinburgh.

5|$|From the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century</b> Scotland gained {{many of the}} organisations {{associated}} with the revival in England, including Sunday schools, mission schools, ragged schools, Bible societies and improvement classes. Because the revival occurred {{at the same time}} as the transformation of the Highlands into a crofting society, Evangelicalism was often linked to popular protest against patronage and the clearances, while the Moderates became identified with the interests of the landholding classes. It laid the ground for the Great Disruption in the mid-nineteenth century, leading to the Evangelicals taking control of the General Assembly and those in the Highlands joining the Free Church of Scotland in large numbers.|$|E
5|$|The Sable Island horse, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Sable Island pony, is a type of small feral horse found on Sable Island, an island off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. It is a small type, often pony sized, but with a horse phenotype and horse ancestors, and usually dark in color. The first horses were released on the island in the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century,</b> and soon became feral. Additional horses were later transported to improve the herd's breeding stock. They were rounded up for private use and sale for slaughter, which by the 1950s had placed them in danger of extinction.|$|E

5|$|The rich fur areas {{along the}} upper Mississippi, Minnesota, Des Moines, and Missouri Rivers, {{otherwise}} occupied by {{peoples of the}} First Nations, were exploited by independent fur traders operating from Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin in the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century.</b> At {{the beginning of the}} nineteenth century, these traders established fur posts in the Minnesota River valley at Lake Traverse, Big Stone Lake, Lac qui Parle, and Traverse des Sioux. The large fur companies also built posts, including the North West Company's stations at Pembina and St. Joseph in the valley of the Red River. The paths between these posts became parts of the first of the Red River Trails.|$|E
5|$|From the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century,</b> castles became tourist attractions. Blair Castle was {{a popular}} {{location}} on account of its landscaped gardens, and Stirling Castle because of its romantic historic connections. Tours became increasingly popular during the nineteenth century, usually starting at Edinburgh and then spending up to two weeks further north, {{taking advantage of the}} expanding rail and steamer network. Blair Castle remained popular, but additional castles joined the circuit, with Cawdor Castle becoming popular once the railway line reached north to Fort William. Scottish castle guidebooks became well known for providing long historical accounts of their sites, often drawing on the plots of Romantic novels for the details. Sir Walter Scott's novels set in Scotland popularised several northern castles, including Tantallon, which was featured in the poem Marmion (1808).|$|E
5|$|Highly distinctive, male lions {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by their manes, and the male's face {{is one of}} the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture. Depictions have existed from the Upper Paleolithic period, with carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves in France dated to 17,000 years ago, through virtually all ancient and medieval cultures where they once occurred. It has been extensively depicted in sculptures, in paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire, and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoos over the world since the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century.</b> Zoos are cooperating worldwide in breeding programs for the endangered Asiatic lions.|$|E

5|$|John and Alexander Runciman both gained reputations as {{painters}} of mythological and historical themes. They travelled to Italy, where they worked with Hamilton. John died in 1768/9 and Alexander returned home. His most widely known work, distributed in etchings, was mythological. His version of The Origin of Painting (1773), depicting Pliny's {{story of a}} young Corinthian woman outlining a shadow on the wall, has her hand guided by Cupid, suggesting the ultimate motivation for art was love. The same theme was painted by another of Hamilton's proteges, David Allan, two years later. In the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century</b> Ossian became a common subject for Scottish artists, and works were undertaken by Alexander Runciman and David Allan among others.|$|E
5|$|Neoclassicism was {{pioneered by}} Gavin Hamilton and his proteges, the {{brothers}} John and Alexander Runciman, and David Allan. Alexander Runciman pioneered historical painting and Alan helped develop genre art, {{both of which}} would be taken up by Scottish artists in the next century. After the Acts of Union in 1707 there was very little patronage for large and expensive works of art in Scotland. With the growth of civic development there was an increasing demand for public statuary and the portrait bust also became popular. Commissions of new statuary tended to be made in relatively cheap lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. From the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century</b> there are a handful of examples of work from Scottish artists.|$|E
5|$|The Nanjakana {{compound}} is {{the most}} highly elevated of the three compounds in the rova at Ambohimanga. Located to the northeast of Mahandrinoro, this compound {{is believed to have}} been first constructed by Andrianjafy in the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century.</b> To the north of the compound is a stone esplanade that offers a clear view of the surrounding areas where Andrianampoinimerina reportedly came to reflect on his military strategy for bringing Imerina under his control. During the 1861 funeral of Queen Ranavalona I held in the Nanjakana compound, a spark accidentally ignited a nearby barrel of gunpowder destined for use in the ceremony, causing an explosion and fire that killed a number of bystanders and destroyed three of the compound's historic royal residences.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityBecause of the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century's</b> {{developments}} {{in the art of}} orchestration, many music teachers became increasingly concerned with how to instruct their students in this subject. They turned to the instrumental tutors which were quite popular {{at the turn of the}} century, and found nothing that discussed timbre or how to combine instruments effectively. In response to a plea for written instruction about orchestration itself, several books that addressed that topic began to appear at the end of the <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century.</b> Within the first four decades of the nineteenth century several orchestration treatises were available. The works of Sundelin, GaBner, Kastner, Berlioz and others supplied information about orchestration as well as common practices of the time. 	Sundlelin's Die Instrumentierung fur Militar Musik (1828) was perhaps the first to discuss the newly invented valve instruments, and it is likely that Die lnstrumentierung fur das Orchester (1828) was the first treatise to comment on instrumental combinations. These works represented the transition between instrumental tutors and orchestration books as we know them today. [TRUNCATED...|$|R

5|$|The monastery {{enjoyed the}} {{patronage}} of hetmans and other benefactors throughout the years. The chief magnet for pilgrims were the relics of Saint Barbara, {{alleged to have}} been brought to Kiev from Constantinople in 1108 by Sviatopolk II Iziaslavych's wife and kept in a silver reliquary donated by Hetman Ivan Mazepa. Although most of the monastery grounds were secularized in the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century,</b> as many as 240 monks resided there in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The monastery served as the residence of the bishop of Chernigov after 1800. A precentor's school was located on the monastery grounds; many prominent composers, such as Kyrylo Stetsenko and Yakiv Yatsynevych, either studied or taught at the school.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} glorifies {{this event}} in Poland's past and its culture, and {{the majesty of}} its kings. At the same time, the painting has darker undertones, reflecting the troubled times that befell Poland in the <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century,</b> for the Kingdom of Prussia {{would become one of}} the partitioning powers that ended the independence of Poland. The painting was seen by some as anti-Prussian, foretelling its perceived betrayal of Poland; others have noted it is also critical of Poland, as Matejko included signs that signify this seemingly triumphant moment was a hollow, wasted victory. Matejko created his painting to remind others {{about the history of the}} no-longer-independent country he loved, and about the changing fates of history. The painting is counted among his masterpieces.|$|E
5|$|After Crowhurst Bridge, {{which carries}} the Burwash to Stonegate road over the river, the railway {{crosses to the}} south bank.

Both the railway and the river turn to the south to reach Robertsbridge. Another tributary, which flows to the {{northwest}} from near a gypsum mine at Brightling, turns {{to the south and}} runs parallel to the Rother before joining it in Robertsbridge. There is a network of channels, as the River Darwell joins the river, and there was formerly a mill nearby. The mill was called Hodson's Mill, and was part of Mill Farm. It burnt down in 1902, and the Georgian farmhouse was subsequently demolished.
