[...] In the shallow water at either end, closest to the land, the boom was formed of wooden piles driven into the sandy seabed and reinforced with concrete – on the Essex side of the boom these extended over 1 mile (1.6 km) into the estuary. [...] Where the boom met the deep water channel it transitioned into an anti-submarine net. [...] At intervals along the net 200-ton lighters were stationed armed with anti-aircraft guns and searchlights. [...] Two gates was included within the net to allow for access by shipping, one towards the north {{for access to the}} Thames and one towards the south for the River Medway ports. [...] These were opened by a Royal Navy boom defence vessel and closed overnight. [...] The boom was backed up by the nearby Maunsell Sea Forts and by a coastal battery at Shoeburyness. [...] The latter housed two 6" [...] naval guns and search-light emplacements protected by landward defences. [...] A second boom was placed across the Thames at Canvey Island and similar protections were installed at the Solent (to protect the naval port of Southampton) and at Plymouth. [...] The remains of the coastal artillery emplacement at Shoeburyness, together with its magazines and search-light emplacements are also visible but lie within the grounds of MoD Shoeburyness with no public access.

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{analysis of}} typical base isolated bridges was conducted. The bridges {{were located in}} different soil types and were subjected to three different earthquakes (recorded on soft and medium soils). The work had two main objectives: to asses {{the effects of the}} nonlinear behavior of the isolation pads of the bridges on the seismic responses (accelerations, displacements, and pier seismic forces), and to study combined effects of base isolation and inertial interaction due to the presence of flexible foundations. The analytical models used for the study were {{selected on the basis of}} initial evaluation of different models proposed in the literature to represent a bridge structure and to evaluate the isolation pads? nonlinear behavior. The bridges studied were developed with a three-dimensional model. After completing the studies, 2 degree of freedom models were used to investigate more general trends of the inertial SSI effects for the base isolated bridges. The results of the work show the efficiency of base isolation pads in improving the seismic performance of bridges in most cases. They suggest that the inertial SSI effects will not be generally important for bridge foundations designed with a factor of safety of 3, with more than one <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>piles</b> in either direction since they will be very stiff foundations.

40|$|Insitu {{concrete}} bored piling is {{a common}} foundation solution for both major building and civil engineering projects. The technique is used both for individual or grouped piles topped with a pile cap, or a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>piles,</b> contiguous or secant, topped with a capping beam {{as part of a}} basement or abutment construction. There are many health hazards associated with bored piles. One of the main risks is the breaking down of the unwanted pile-top, typically using hand-held pneumatic breakers. This operation creates particular problems for hand arm vibration syndrome (HAVS), dust and noise. But there are several viable alternatives to this procedure that remove or significantly reduce these risks. These innovations have been developed by the construction supply chain and are readily available. D 4 h, a UK Government-funded research project by Loughborough University and the European Construction Institute, has demonstrated that designers can play their part in encouraging their adoption, without straying into the perceived danger of specifying means and methods. If designers are willing to identify pile-top break down as a significant residual risk in their health and safety assessment, thus requiring the Principal Contractor 1 to provide proposals to address this risk – this may be the only push needed to get the industry to eliminate the major HAVS problem from insitu bored piles. This paper will benefit the health and safety research community, especially those working on designer intervention. The paper will also be of use to industry practitioners, providing innovative solutions to a significant occupational health risk as well as challenging designers to take construction health and safety more seriously...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{calculation}} {{equation of}} large diameter bored pile's effective length {{is connected with}} its distribution <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> shaft resistance. Thus, {{there is a great}} difference between the calculation results under the different distributions <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> shaft resistance. Primarily, this paper summarizes the conceptualized mode <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> shaft resistance under the circumstance that the soil surrounding the piles presents different layer distributions. Secondly, based on Mindlin's displacement solution and in consideration of the effect <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> diameter, the calculation equation is optimized with the assumption that the pile shaft resistance has a parabolic distribution. The influencing factors are analyzed according to the calculation result <b>of</b> effective <b>pile</b> length. Finally, combined with an engineering example, the calculation equation deduced in this paper is analyzed and verified. The result shows that both the Poisson ratio <b>of</b> soil and <b>pile</b> diameter have impacted the effective pile length. Compared with the Poisson ratio of soil, the effect <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> diameter is more significant. If the pile diameter remains the same, the effect of the Poisson ratio of soil to the effective pile length decreases as the ratio <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> elastic modulus and soil share modulus increases. If the Poisson ratio of soil remains the same, the effect <b>of</b> the <b>pile</b> diameter to the effective pile length increases as the ratio <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> elastic modulus and soil share modulus increases.
