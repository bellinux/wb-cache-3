5|$|Apoptosis is a {{controlled}} {{process in which}} the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the <b>lamin</b> networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases, which cleave the <b>lamin</b> proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. <b>Lamin</b> cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays for early apoptotic activity. Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus. Inhibition of <b>lamin</b> assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.|$|E
5|$|Mutations in <b>lamin</b> genes {{leading to}} defects in {{filament}} assembly cause {{a group of}} rare genetic disorders known as laminopathies. The most notable laminopathy is the family of diseases known as progeria, which causes the appearance of premature aging in its sufferers. The exact mechanism by which the associated biochemical changes give rise to the aged phenotype is not well understood.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear lamina is {{composed}} mostly of <b>lamin</b> proteins. Like all proteins, lamins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and later {{transported to the}} nucleus interior, where they are assembled before being incorporated into the existing network of nuclear lamina. Lamins found on the cytosolic face of the membrane, such as emerin and nesprin, bind to the cytoskeleton to provide structural support. Lamins are also found inside the nucleoplasm where they form another regular structure, known as the nucleoplasmic veil, that is visible using fluorescence microscopy. The actual function of the veil is not clear, although it is excluded from the nucleolus and is present during interphase. <b>Lamin</b> structures {{that make up the}} veil, such as LEM3, bind chromatin and disrupting their structure inhibits transcription of protein-coding genes.|$|E
40|$|<b>Lamins</b> are {{intermediate}} filaments {{that form}} a complex meshwork at the inner nuclear membrane. Mammalian cells express {{two types of}} <b>Lamins,</b> <b>Lamins</b> A/C and <b>Lamins</b> B, encoded by three different genes, LMNA, LMNB 1 and LMNB 2. Mutations in the LMNA gene {{are associated with a}} group of phenotypically diverse diseases referred to as laminopathies. <b>Lamins</b> interact with a large number of binding partners including proteins of the nuclear envelope but also chromatin-associated factors. <b>Lamins</b> not only constitute a scaffold for nuclear shape, rigidity and resistance to stress but also contribute to the organization of chromatin and chromosomal domains. We will discuss here the impact of A-type <b>Lamins</b> loss on alterations of chromatin organization and formation of chromatin domains and how disorganization of the lamina contributes to the patho-physiology of premature ageing syndromes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To study a {{possible}} interaction of nuclear <b>lamins</b> with chromatin, we examined assembly of <b>lamins</b> A and C at mitotic chromosome surfaces in vitro. When a postmicrosomal supernatant of metaphase CHO cells containing disassembled <b>lamins</b> A and C is incubated with chromosomes isolated from mitotic Chinese hamster ovary cells, <b>lamins</b> A and C undergo dephosphorylation and uniformly coat the chromosome surfaces. Furthermore, when purified rat liver <b>lamins</b> A and C are dialyzed with mitotic chromosomes into a buffer of physiological ionic strength and pH, <b>lamins</b> A and C coat chromosomes {{in a similar}} fashion. In both cases a lamin-containing supramolecular structure is formed that remains intact when the chromatin is removed by digestion with micrococca...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear <b>lamins</b> were {{initially}} {{identified as the}} major components of the nuclear lamina, a proteinaceous layer found at the interface between chromatin and the inner nuclear membrane (Fawcett 1966). Due to their position at {{the periphery of the}} nucleus, <b>lamins</b> were originally proposed to support the nuclear envelope and provide anchorage sites for chromatin. Recently, the nuclear <b>lamins</b> have also been found in the nucleoplasm (Fig. 1). In addition, experimental and genetic evidence suggest that nuclear <b>lamins</b> are involved {{in a number of other}} functions including nuclear envelope assembly, DNA synthesis, transcription, and apoptosis.

5|$|Kulintang {{music was}} also crucial in {{relation}} to courtships due to {{the very nature of}} Islamic custom, which did not allow for unmarried men and women to intermingle. Traditionally, unmarried daughters were kept in a special chamber in the attic called a <b>lamin,</b> off-limit to visitors and suitors. It was only when she was allowed to play during kulintang performances that suitors were allowed to view her. Because of this, kulintang music was rare socially approved vehicles for interaction among the sexes.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{components}} of other intermediate filaments, the <b>lamin</b> monomer contains an alpha-helical domain used by two monomers to coil around each other, forming a dimer structure called a coiled coil. Two of these dimer structures then join side by side, in an antiparallel arrangement, to form a tetramer called a protofilament. Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike filament. These filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in {{the length of the}} filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Gaddafi was overjoyed by the {{foundation}} of the Arab Maghreb Union, uniting Libya in an economic pact with Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, viewing it as beginnings of a new Pan-Arab union. Meanwhile, Libya stepped up its support for anti-Western militants such as the Provisional IRA, and in 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie in Scotland, killing 243 passengers and 16 crew members, plus 11 people on the ground. British police investigations identified two Libyans – Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and <b>Lamin</b> Khalifah Fhimah – as the chief suspects, and in November 1991 issued a declaration demanding that Libya hand them over. When Gaddafi refused, citing the Montreal Convention, the United Nations (UN) imposed Resolution 748 in March 1992, initiating economic sanctions against Libya which had deep repercussions for the country's economy. The country suffered an estimated $900 million financial loss as a result. Further problems arose with the West when in January 1989, two Libyan warplanes were shot down by the U.S. off the Libyan coast. Many African states opposed the UN sanctions, with Mandela criticizing them on a visit to Gaddafi in October 1997, when he praised Libya for its work in fighting apartheid and awarded Gaddafi the Order of Good Hope. They would only be suspended in 1998 when Libya agreed to allow the extradition of the suspects to the Scottish Court in the Netherlands, in a process overseen by Mandela.|$|E

40|$|Changes in the {{expression}} {{and distribution of}} nuclear <b>lamins</b> were investigated during C 2 C 12 myoblast differentiation. The expression of most <b>lamins</b> was unchanged during myogenesis. By contrast, lamin-B 2 expression increased and LAP 2 expression decreased twofold. These changes were correlated with reduced solubility and redistribution of A-type <b>lamins.</b> When C 2 C 12 myoblasts were transfected with a lamin-A mutant that causes autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (AD-EDMD), the mutant protein accumulated in the nucleoplasm and exerted dominant influences over endogenous <b>lamins.</b> Myoblasts transfected with wild-type <b>lamins</b> differentiated, albeit more slowly, whereas myoblasts transfected with mutant <b>lamins</b> failed to differentiate. Myoblast differentiation requires dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein Rb. During myogenesis, Rb was rapidly and progressively dephosphorylated. Underphosphorylated Rb formed complexes with LAP 2 in proliferating myoblasts and postmitotic myoblasts. In myoblasts transfected with the mutant <b>lamins,</b> this complex was disrupted. These data suggest that remodelling of the nucleoskeleton is necessary for skeletal-muscle differentiation and for correct regulation of Rb pathways...|$|R

40|$|A-type <b>lamins</b> are {{intermediate}} filament {{proteins that}} provide a scaffold for protein complexes regulating nuclear structure and function. Mutations in the LMNA gene are linked {{to a variety of}} degenerative disorders termed laminopathies, whereas changes in the expression of <b>lamins</b> are associated with tumourigenesis. The molecular pathways affected by alterations of A-type <b>lamins</b> and how they contribute to disease are poorly understood. Here, we show that A-type <b>lamins</b> have {{a key role in the}} maintenance of telomere structure, length and function, and in the stabilization of 53 BP 1, a component of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. Loss of A-type <b>lamins</b> alters the nuclear distribution of telomeres and results in telomere shortening, defects in telomeric heterochromatin, and increased genomic instability. In addition, A-type <b>lamins</b> are necessary for the processing of dysfunctional telomeres by non-homologous end joining, putatively through stabilization of 53 BP 1. This study shows new functions for A-type <b>lamins</b> in the maintenance of genomic integrity, and suggests that alterations of telomere biology and defects in DDR contribute to the pathogenesis of lamin-related diseases...|$|R

25|$|After being translated, a farnesol {{is added}} to prelamin A using protein farnesyltransferase; this {{farnesylation}} is important in targeting <b>lamin</b> to the nuclear envelope, where it maintains its integrity.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Mutations in genes {{encoding}} A-type <b>lamins</b> and emerin cause cardiomyopathy {{and muscular}} dystrophy. We previously showed {{activation of the}} extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) branch of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade in hearts of mice with mutations in these genes. Here, we tested the hypothesis that reducing A-type <b>lamins</b> and emerin in cultured cells activate ERK signaling. Methods: We used siRNA to knockdown A-type <b>lamins</b> and emerin in HeLa and C 2 C 12 cells. Activation of ERK was assessed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy with antibodies against phosphorylated protein and by using real-time RT-PCR to measure RNAs encoded by genes for transcription factors stimulated by ERK. Results: Knockdown of A-type <b>lamins</b> and emerin in HeLa and C 2 C 12 stimulated phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of ERK as well as activation of genes encoding downstream transcription factors. A MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor reduced ERK phosphorylation in cells with reduced expression of A-type <b>lamins</b> and emerin. Conclusions: These results provide proof for the hypothesis that altered expression of emerin and A-type <b>lamins</b> activates ERK signaling, which in turn can cause cardiomyopathy. General significance: ERK is a potential target for the pharmacological treatment of cardiomyopathy caused by mutations in the genes encoding emerin and A-type <b>lamins...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Apoptosis is {{a highly}} {{organized}} process of programmed cell death. <b>Lamins</b> are crucial targets for this process due to their close associations with chromatin and the nuclear envelope.

40|$|A-type <b>lamins</b> {{provide a}} {{scaffold}} for tethering chromatin and protein complexes regulating nuclear structure and function. Interest in <b>lamins</b> increased after mutations in the LMNA gene {{were found to}} be associated with a variety of human disorders termed laminopathies. These include muscular dystrophy, cardiomyopathy, lipodystrophy, peripheral neuropathy and premature aging syndromes such as progeria. In addition, altered expression of A-type <b>lamins</b> is emerging as a contributing factor to tumorigenesis. How different alterations in a gene that is ubiquitously expressed can cause such an array of systemic as well as tissue specific diseases remains an enigma. Several lines of evidence indicate that mutant forms of A-type <b>lamins</b> impact on genome function and integrity. A current model suggests that genomic instability plays a major part in the pathophysiology of some lamin-related diseases. However, this model remains to be fully investigated. Here we discuss recent studies revealing novel functions for A-type <b>lamins</b> in the maintenance of telomeres and in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway.

Unlike their peripheral counterparts, these internal <b>lamins</b> are buried in dense chromatin and so are inaccessible to antibodies, but accessibility can be increased by removing chromatin. Knobs and nodes on an internal skeleton can then be immunolabelled using fluorescein- or gold-conjugated anti-lamin A antibodies.

25|$|HGPS {{is caused}} by {{sporadic}} mutations (not inherited from parent) in the LMNA gene, which encodes for <b>lamin</b> A. Specifically, most HGPS are caused by a dominant, de novo, point mutation p.G608G (GGC > GGT). This mutation causes a splice site within exon 11 of the pre-mRNA to come into action, leading to the last 150 base pairs of that exon, and consequently, the 50 amino acids near the C-terminus, being deleted. This results in a truncated <b>lamin</b> A precursor (a.k.a. progerin or LaminAΔ50).|$|E

40|$|The {{inducible}} human promyelocytic {{cell line}} HL- 60 {{is known to}} express a limited complement of intermediate filament proteins (IFPs). In the undifferentiated state these cells express B-type nuclear <b>lamins,</b> but lack <b>lamins</b> A and C and the cytoplasmic IFP vimentin (Paulin-Levasseur et al., 1988). In the present study, the HL- 60 cell system {{was used to determine}} whether expression of <b>lamins</b> A and C was associated with the differentiated phenotype. HL- 60 were treated with two different inducers of monocyte/macrophage differentiation: vitamin D 3 and TPA. A detailed kinetic analysis of <b>lamins</b> A and C protein expression throughout the differentiation period was made using immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM). The expression of vimentin, the monocyte marker 63 D 3 and transferrin receptor (TR) were assessed in like manner. HL- 60 proliferation was monitored by cell counts, 3 H-thymidineincorporation and cell cycle analysis. Induction of HL- 60 cell differentiation by vitamin D 3 did not lead to expression of either <b>lamins</b> A/C or vimentin. Treatment with TPA, on the other hand, resulted in expression of these proteins {{in the vast majority of}} cells within 24 hours. Examination of marker expression and proliferation confirmed that both vitamin D 3 and TPA induced differentiation in the treated cells. However, exposure to the vitamin resulted in cells which were monocyte-like, while TPA treatment gave rise to cells that more closely resembled macrophages. <b>Lamins</b> A/C expression was clearly not associated with growth arrest in the vitamin D 3 -treated cells, and was found to follow inhibition of replication in TPA-treated populations. It was determined that <b>lamins</b> A/C expression was not coincident with expression of the differentiated phenotype. These results suggested that <b>lamins</b> A/C expression was a post-differentiation event in the HL- 60 cell system. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
