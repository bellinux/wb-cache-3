Early the next morning they entered the village and screened the inhabitants, before taking adult males away for brief questioning, detaining communists and South Vietnamese military deserters or conscription evaders and returning the rest to the village. At the fair, the village of 9,000 were entertained by South Vietnamese and American military bands, while the South Vietnamese military cultural troupe performed plays, folk singing and dancing. Games for children, lotteries and a free <b>lunch</b> <b>of</b> unfamiliar western food were provided to the villagers.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} {{significant}} bridges was the Beaumont road {{bridge over the}} Clutha River, which {{is also known as}} the Dunkeld Bridge, as this was the original survey name for the township that soon took the name of Beaumont. The bridge was opened by John Anderson on 4 March 1887 with a champagne lunch. A champagne <b>lunch</b> <b>of</b> such proportions that the location for the presentation is still called Champagne Flat was held {{at the opening of the}} Waiau Ferry Bridge, these days a Category I heritage item registered with Heritage New Zealand. Another early and outstanding bridge was the Waiteti Viaduct, the northernmost viaduct on the North Island Main Trunk railway a few kilometres south of Te Kuiti. This structure was also completed in 1887. Probably the most significant structure on the North Island Main Trunk Railway is the Makatote Viaduct 12km south of National Park. At 79m, it is the highest on this line. It took three years to build and Andrew Anderson moved his family to the construction village, so that he could oversee the work. The viaduct was commissioned in 1908.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{attacks and}} counterattacks shifted the lines {{back and forth}} as Johnson {{received}} more and more reinforcements—McNair's Brigade (commanded by Col. David Coleman), and Deas's and Manigault's brigades from Hindman's division—but many of these men were exhausted. Van Derveer's brigade arrived from the Kelly Field line to beef up the Union defense. Brig. Gen. Patton Anderson's brigade (Hindman's Division) attempted to assault the hill in the gap between Johnson and Kershaw. Despite all the furious activity on Snodgrass Hill, Longstreet was exerting little direction on the battlefield, enjoying a leisurely <b>lunch</b> <b>of</b> bacon and sweet potatoes with his staff in the rear. Summoned to a meeting with Bragg, Longstreet asked the army commander for reinforcements from Polk's stalled wing, even though he had not committed his own reserve, Preston's division. Bragg was becoming distraught and told Longstreet that the battle was being lost, something Longstreet found inexplicable, considering the success of his assault column. Bragg knew, however, that his success on {{the southern end of the}} battlefield was merely driving his opponents to their escape route to Chattanooga and that the opportunity to destroy the Army of the Cumberland had evaporated. After the repeated delays in the morning's attacks, Bragg had lost confidence in his generals on the right wing, and while denying Longstreet reinforcements told him [...] "There is not a man in the right wing who has any fight in him." ...|$|E
2500|$|During Australias 1882 tour to England, Nottinghamshire {{played a}} {{first-class}} match against the tourists at Trent Bridge. During <b>lunch</b> <b>of</b> {{one of the}} days the match was played over, the Australians discovered that no lunch had been provided for them. It was, in those days, custom for hosts to looks after amateur [...] "gentlemen". Professionals were deemed to be those making money from playing, which the Australians were, and were therefore expected to provide their own lunch. Despite this, the Australians were enraged and confronted Holden, {{who had been in}} charge of lunch arrangements. In a heated exchange with the Australians manager Charles Beal and batsman George Bonnor, he told them he had [...] "forgot" [...] to provide lunch, then reminded them as paid professionals they were expected to find their own. Aggravated by the argument with Beal and Bonnor, Holden was reported to have then turned on Australian captain Billy Murdoch to remind him it was him, in his capacity of secretary, and not the umpires or team captains who had the right to demand when the pitch be rolled. Bonnor by this point was being restrained to avoid a physical altercation with Holden. During the night, a member of the Australian touring party chalked some derogatory remarks about Holden in the hotel in which the team was staying. When discovered, Holden openly accused Beal of writing the remarks. However, it was discovered that Holden himself had made the remarks in an attempt to get one over on Beal.|$|E

2500|$|Shi {{immediately}} started learning kung fu, Chan Buddhism and acupuncture from his masters, Liu Xin Yi and Shen Ping An, who were Shaolin disciples living outside the temple, rather than monks. Because {{of the open}} nature of the temple, where people could come and go easily, he says he learned to read people. Despite his training, Shi also amused himself by playing pranks on his masters, who would punish him either with beatings, or by making him do the horse stance until his legs were numb and swollen, or making do headstands until the blood draining into his head caused pain. Shi's daily routine consisted of awakening at 4:30 am to practice for two hours, followed by a breakfast of steamed tofu and vegetables, prayer, meditation or relaxation for an hour, and then another {{three and a half}} hours of practice. This would be followed by more prayer, Buddhism studies, and cleaning or other Temple work. Although Shaolin monks do not necessarily follow the practice of other monks who do not eat past noon, those at the temple would eat a <b>lunch</b> <b>of</b> noodles, rice or mantou at 11:30 am, out of respect to monks visiting from other temples. After an hour of relaxation, Shi would practice and pray again from 1:00 pm to 5:30 pm, followed by dinner, more relaxation, and more practice until 10:00 pm. From then until 4:00 am the monks would work in shifts to check the temple's incense. The monks slept on a piece of wood with a blanket on it, sometimes using their clothes for pillows, which Shi says is good for the back, compared to American beds, which he says are too comfortable. Although Shi met his Buddhism Shifu, Shi Yong Qian, almost immediately after entering the temple, he did not begin seriously studying with him until he was about 14 or 15. Because the temple did not have running water, the monks had to transport it from mountain rivers just outside the temple, draw it from a well, and collect rainwater. When the temple acquired running water in 1986, the monks were dissatisfied, because under the system of feng shui, digging up the ground and laying in pipes was, as Shi puts it, akin to [...] "cutting your veins out". During the cold winter months, bathing was restricted to washing selected body parts, rather than immersion in or under water. Even today the temple only has cold water.|$|E
2500|$|Oscott also {{produced}} writers whose {{relationship with their}} Catholic background was ambiguous or actively hostile, and who – often writing from exile – were to become leading figures of the decadent literature of {{the close of the}} 19th century. The Irish-born George Moore was provoked into becoming a writer by his seven years at Oscott, which he called [...] "a vile hole, a den of priests", turning to Byron and Shelley and noting that [...] "it pleased me to read 'Queen Mab' and 'Cain' amid the priests and ignorance of a hateful Roman Catholic college". His early novels – particularly his 1885 work A Mummer's Wife, which dealt with alcoholism and the seedy underside of theatrical life – [...] "opened up new possibilities for the novel in English", being the first to break away from the literary conventions of the Victorian style {{under the influence of the}} naturalism of Émile Zola. Moore constantly developed the form of his literary self-expression, with his later novels having a more fragmented, tapestry-like structure. He was a pivotal figure in the transition from Victorian to modern fiction, and a particular influence on James Joyce: the critic Graham Hough wrote that [...] "neither the title nor the content of Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man would have been quite the same in 1916 if it had not been for the prior existence of George Moore's Confessions of a Young Man in 1886." [...] "The Dead", the final story of Joyce's Dubliners, was directly inspired by Moore's 1891 novel Vain Fortune. The eccentric novelist and artist Frederick Rolfe studied at Oscott from 1887, but left after it was decided he was an unsuitable candidate for the priesthood. Despite his open homosexuality he strongly felt himself to have a vocation for the priesthood throughout his lifetime. His most famous work was the decadent semi-autobiographical wish-fulfilment novel Hadrian the Seventh, published under his self-styled title Baron Corvo, in which he imagined himself as the Pope, but he also wrote short stories, poetry and essays. Wilfrid Scawen Blunt was inspired to become poet by the metaphysical teachings of Oscott's professor of philosophy during the 1850s, but embarked upon a succession of affairs during his subsequent career as a diplomat, becoming a self-confessed hedonist. He is best known for his erotic verse, and for his anti-imperialist opposition to British policy in Ireland, Egypt, Sudan and India. In 1914 a group of poets including W. B. Yeats, Ezra Pound, and Richard Aldington entertained Blunt to a <b>lunch</b> <b>of</b> roast peacock, paying tribute to him as the first poet to relate poetry to real life. Pound wrote of Blunt's [...] "unconquered flame", though Yeats was more ambivalent, confiding in T. Sturge Moore that [...] "only a small part of his work is good but that is exceedingly fine".|$|E
