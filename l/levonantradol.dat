50|$|<b>Levonantradol</b> {{has been}} {{clinically}} tested in cancer patients for its pain relief and antiemetic benefits. Cancer patients that endure chemotherapy often develop intense nausea, and <b>Levonantradol</b> {{has been tested}} to reduce these emetic symptoms. It is often used instead of THC {{because it has a}} higher efficacy. <b>Levonantradol</b> also acts on pain pathways in the central nervous system, which enables the drug to alleviate pain. Studies have shown an absence of emetic side effects within the half-life of the <b>Levonantradol</b> administered. Other studies suggest that cannabinoid agonists can synergize opioid anti-nociception. Cannabinoid receptors are located in nociceptive pathways, and CBs can promote signal transduction in TRP channels. Although <b>Levonantradol</b> relieves nociceptive and postoperative pain, decreases nausea, and improves spasticity in addition to being more effective than placebos, it has yet to be approved as legal medicine. Researchers have concluded that <b>Levonantradol</b> is no more effective than Codeine, which is why they do not recommend expansion into clinical practice.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>Levonantradol</b> {{has been}} {{extensively}} tested on animals including cats, rodents, and non-human primates. It has also been tested among cancer patient populations in clinical trials. <b>Levonantradol</b> is most commonly administered intramuscularly (I.M.), however {{it can also be}} administered orally. The dosage can range from 0.25 mg-3.0 mg every 2-4 hours, and the half-life is 1-2 hours. In order to administer <b>Levonantradol</b> intramuscularly, the drug must be dissolved in 5% ethanol, 5% emulphur, and 90% sterile saline. Synthetic cannabinoids like <b>Levonantradol</b> readily cross the blood-brain barrier because they are highly lipophilic and have low molecular weights. Levonantradol’s bioavailability is variable due to the first pass metabolism.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levonantradol</b> {{is a full}} CB1 {{receptor}} agonist. Cannabinoid receptors {{belong to}} the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), and endogenous cannabinoids naturally activate GPCRs. GPCRs modulate the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and accumulation of the second messenger, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The CB1 receptor {{is the most common}} GPCR in the central nervous system. The activation of CB1Rs decrease calcium conductance and increase potassium conductance in the brain. CB signaling naturally modulates synaptic transmission and mediates psychoactivity, and synthetic cannabinoids mimic these same actions. Although the efficacy of <b>Levonantradol</b> is dependent on the level of GCPR activity, Full agonists like <b>Levonantradol</b> have the ability to activate GPCRs and convert Gα into a high affinity state for GTP or low affinity state for GDP. Previous studies suggest that <b>Levonantradol</b> has a higher binding affinity and efficacy than other similar synthetic cannabinoids (e.g. Δ9-THC).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In rhesus monkeys, acute {{administration}} of <b>levonantradol</b> and nantradol produced signs of CNS depression, including ataxia with body sag, pupil dilation, ptosis, dozing, and reduced responsivity to external stimuli. Neither compound sup-pressed the morphine withdrawal syndrome; however, both alleviated the chronic abdominal contraction associated with withdrawal. The directly observable {{effects of these}} compounds were not antagonized by naloxone. When <b>levonantradol</b> was admin-istered every 6 hours, marked tolerance developed to both the effects of <b>levonantradol</b> and nabilone and THC. No signs of withdrawal were observed when <b>levonantradol</b> injections were abruptly discontinued. When substituted in lieu of codeine under an intravenous drug self-administration procedure, neither <b>levonantradol</b> nor nantradol maintained responding at rates higher than those maintained by their vehicle. Finally, the discriminative effects of <b>levonantradol</b> were not equivalent {{to those of the}} narcot-ics ethylketazocine or etorphine.

40|$|Abstract: Investigation of {{cannabinoid}} pharmacology in a vertebrate with a phylogenetic history {{distinct from}} that of mammals may allow {{better understanding of the}} phys-iological significance of cannabinoid neurochemistry. Taricha granulosa, the roughskin newt, was used here to characterize an amphibian cannabinoid receptor. Behav-ioral experiments demonstrated that the cannabinoid ag-onist <b>levonantradol</b> inhibits both newt spontaneous loco-motor activity and courtship clasping behavior. Inhibition of clasping was dose-dependent and potent (IC 50 5 1. 2 mg per animal). Radioligand binding studies using [3 H]CP- 55940 allowed identification of a specific binding site (KD 5 6. 5 nM, Bmax 5 1, 853 fmol/mg of protein) in brain membranes. Rank order of affinity of several ligands was consistent with that reported for mammalian species (KD, nM) : CP- 55940 (3. 8). <b>levonantradol</b> (13. 0). WIN 55212 - 2 (25. 7) [...] anandamide (1, 665) ’ anand-amide 1 100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2, 398). The cDNA encoding the newt CB 1 cannabinoid receptor was cloned, and the corresponding mRNA of 5. 9 kb was found to be highly expressed in brain. A nonclonal Chi-nese hamster ovary cell line stably expressing the newt CB 1 cannabinoid receptor was prepared that allowed demonstration of cannabinoid-mediated inhibition of ad-enylate cyclase (EC 4. 6. 1. 1) activity. This inhibition was dose-dependent and occurred at concentrations consis-tent with affinities determined through radioligand bind-ing experiments. The behavioral, pharmacological, and molecular cloning results demonstrate that a CB 1 can-nabinoid receptor is expressed in the CNS of the rough-skin newt. This amphibian CB 1 is very similar in density, ligand binding affinity, ligand binding specificity, and amino acid sequence to mammalian CB 1. The high de-gree of evolutionary conservation of cannabinoid signal-ing systems implies an important physiological role in vertebrate brain function.

40|$|The tetrahydroquinolines {{structural}} unit {{is found in}} a number of natural products that exhibit a variety of biological activities including anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory and antitumour. As a result there is significant interest in their synthesis. This PhD thesis describes the work undertaken {{in the development of a}} new synthetic route that can be applied to the asymmetric synthesis of structurally diverse tetrahydroquinolines. The introductory chapter outlines the main current synthetic strategies towards tetrahydroquinolines and their application to the synthesis of some biologically interesting compounds. Chapter 2 discusses work on the total asymmetric synthesis of the Galipea alkaloids. An aza-Michael reaction was used to install the required stereochemistry. Extensive optimisation of the aza-Michael reaction resulted in high enantioselectivities, with optically pure material obtained upon recrystallisation. Various synthetic procedures were investigated for formation of the tetrahydroquinoline ring system and the remainder of the synthesis, with the Galipea alkaloids obtained from a common precursor. Work towards the formal synthesis of the Martinelline alkaloids, using the aza-Michael reaction to set the first stereocentre, is detailed in Chapter 3. A range of different α, β-unsaturated carbonyl and anilines were investigated for the aza-Michael reaction, with 85 % enantioselectivity obtained on optimisation. Formation of the tetrahydroquinoline core was achieved and the installation of the second chiral centre investigated. Chapter 4 describes any miscellaneous work conducted, including preliminary investigations towards the synthesis of <b>levonantradol.</b> The last Chapter contains the experimental procedures and characterisation data for all the compounds synthesised during the course of this project.

40|$|This paper aims to {{evaluate}} the anti-emetic efficacy of cannabinoids in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy using a systematic review of literature searched within electronic databases such as PUBMED, EMBASE, PSYCINFO, LILACS, and 'The Cochrane Collaboration Controlled Trials Register'. Studies chosen were randomized clinical trials comprising all publications of each database until December 2006. From 12 749 initially identified papers, 30 fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review, with demonstration of superiority of the anti-emetic efficacy of cannabinoids compared with conventional drugs and placebo. the adverse effects were more intense and occurred more often among patients who used cannabinoids. Five meta-analyses were carried out: (1) dronabinol versus placebo [n = 185; relative risk (RR) = 0. 47; confidence interval (CI) = 0. 19 - 1. 16]; (2) Dronabinol versus neuroleptics [n = 325; RR = 0. 67; CI = 0. 47 - 0. 96; number needed to treat (NNT) = 3. 4]; (3) nabilone versus neuroleptics (n = 277; RR = 0. 88; CI = 0. 72 - 1. 08); (4) <b>levonantradol</b> versus neuroleptics (n = 194; RR = 0. 94; CI = 0. 75 - 1. 18); and (5) patients' preference for cannabis or other drugs (n = 1138; RR = 0. 33; CI = 0. 24 - 0. 44; NNT = 1. 8). {{the superiority of the}} anti-emetic efficacy of cannabinoids was demonstrated through meta-analysis.

40|$|The {{biological}} response to cannabinoid agonist begins when the agonist-bound receptor activates G-protein Gα subunits, thus initiating {{a cascade of}} signal transduction pathways. For this reason, information about cannabinoid receptors/G-protein coupling is critical to understand both the acute and chronic actions of cannabinoids. This review focuses on these mechanisms, predominantly examining the ability of cannabinoid agonists to activate G-proteins in brain with agonist-stimulated [35 S]guanylyl- 5 ′-O-(γ-thio) -triphosphate ([35 S]GTPγS) binding. Acute efficacies of cannabinoid agonists {{at the level of}} G-protein activation depend not only on the ability of the agonist to induce a high affinity state in Gα for GTP, but also to induce a low affinity for GDP. When several agonists are compared, it is clear that cannabinoid agonists differ considerably in their efficacy. Both WIN 55212 - 2 and <b>levonantradol</b> are full agonists, while Δ 9 is a weak partial agonist. Of interest, anandamide and its stable analog methanand amide are partial agonists. Chronic treatment in vivo with cannabinoids produces significant tolerance to the physiological and behavioral effects of these drugs, and several studies have shown that this is accompanied by a significant loss in the ability of cannabinoid receptors to couple to G-proteins in brain. These effects vary across different brain regions and are usually (but not always) accompanied by loss of cannabinoid receptor binding. Although the relationship between cannabinoid receptor desensitization and tolerance has not yet been established, these mechanisms may represent events that lead to a loss of cannabinoid agonist response and development of tolerance...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{establish}} whether cannabis is {{an effective}} and safe treatment option {{in the management of}} pain. Design: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials. Data sources: Electronic databases Medline, Embase, Oxford Pain Database, and Cochrane Library; references from identified papers; hand searches. Study selection: Trials of cannabis given by any route of administration (experimental intervention) with any analgesic or placebo (control intervention) in patients with acute, chronic non-malignant, or cancer pain. Outcomes examined were pain intensity scores, pain relief scores, and adverse effects. Validity of trials was assessed independently with the Oxford score. Data extraction: Independent data extraction; discrepancies resolved by consensus. Data synthesis: 20 randomised controlled trials were identified, 11 of which were excluded. Of the 9 included trials (222 patients), 5 trials related to cancer pain, 2 to chronic non-malignant pain, and 2 to acute postoperative pain. No randomised controlled trials evaluated cannabis; all tested active substances were cannabinoids. Oral delta- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 5 - 20 mg, an oral synthetic nitrogen analogue of THC 1 mg, and intramuscular <b>levonantradol</b> 1. 5 - 3 mg were about as effective as codeine 50 - 120 mg, and oral benzopyranoperidine 2 - 4 mg was less effective than codeine 60 - 120 mg and no better than placebo. Adverse effects, most often psychotropic, were common. Conclusion: Cannabinoids are no more effective than codeine in controlling pain and have depressant effects on the central nervous system that limit their use. Their widespread introduction into clinical practice for pain management is therefore undesirable. In acute postoperative pain they should not be used. Before cannabinoids can be considered for treating spasticity and neuropathic pain, further valid randomised controlled studies are needed. Citation: Campbell, F. A. et al. (2001).

40|$|Objective: To {{quantify}} the antiemetic efficacy and {{adverse effects of}} cannabis used for sickness induced chemotherapy. Design: Systematic review. Data sources: Systematic search (Medline, Embase, Cochrane library, bibliographies), any language, to August 2000. Studies: 30 randomised comparisons of cannabis with placebo or antiemetics from which dichotomous data on efficacy and harm were available (1366 patients). Oral nabilone, oral dronabinol (tetrahydrocannabinol), and intramuscular <b>levonantradol</b> were tested. No cannabis was smoked. Follow up lasted 24 hours. Results: Cannabinoids were more effective antiemetics than prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, chlorpromazine, thiethylperazine, haloperidol, domperidone, or alizapride: relative risk 1. 38 (95 % confidence interval 1. 18 to 1. 62), number needed to treat 6 for complete control of nausea; 1. 28 (1. 08 to 1. 51), NNT 8 for complete control of vomiting. Cannabinoids were not more effective in patients receiving very low or very high emetogenic chemotherapy. In crossover trials, patients preferred cannabinoids for future chemotherapy cycles: 2. 39 (2. 05 to 2. 78), NNT 3. Some potentially beneficial side effects occurred more often with cannabinoids: "high" 10. 6 (6. 86 to 16. 5), NNT 3; sedation or drowsiness 1. 66 (1. 46 to 1. 89); euphoria 12. 5 (3. 00 to 52. 1), NNT 7. Harmful side effects also occurred more often with cannabinoids: dizziness 2. 97 (2. 31 - 3. 83), NNT 3; dysphoria or depression 8. 06 (3. 38 - 19. 2), NNT 8; hallucinations 6. 10 (2. 41 - 15. 4), NNT 17; paranoia 8. 58 (6. 38 to 11. 5), NNT 20; and arterial hypotension 2. 23 (1. 75 to 2. 83), NNT 7. Patients given cannabinoids {{were more likely to}} withdraw due to side effects 4. 67 (3. 07 to 7. 09), NNT 11. Conclusions: In selected patients, the cannabinoids tested in these trials may be useful as mood enhancing adjuvants for controlling chemotherapy related sickness. Potentially serious adverse effects, even when taken short term orally or intramuscularly, are likely to limit their widespread use. Citation: Tramèr, M. R. et al. (2001).
