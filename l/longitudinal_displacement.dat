For this purpose pieces of leather, cloth, or other material have heretofore been used, but without the desired success.

The under side of the pad is formed by a sheet of leather, which is crimped in order to have its ends turned up without producing wrinkles; the stuffing in the pad is of hay, or any other suitable material.

40|$|Using {{ultrasound}} {{we recently}} demonstrated that in central elastic arteries {{as well as}} in large muscular arteries in humans there is a distinct <b>longitudinal</b> <b>displacement</b> of the arterial wall during the cardiac cycle. Further, for the first time, we also demonstrated that the inner parts of the vessel wall, the intima-media complex, in these vessels exhibit a larger <b>longitudinal</b> <b>displacement</b> than the outer part of the vessel wall, the adventitial region, introducing the presence of substantial shear strain, and thus shear stress within the vessel wall. The role of these unexplored phenomena is unknown. Here, in a first study on the longitudinal movements of the porcine common carotid artery, we show that administration of adrenaline (epinephrine) might have pronounced effects on the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>displacement</b> of the intima-media complex. In this experiment the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>displacement</b> of the intima-media complex increased > 200 % at the highest blood pressure levels as compared to baseline. Further, shear strain within the wall increased > 250 %; the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>displacement</b> of the adventitial region being smaller than that of the intima-media complex. Thus, our results indicate that adrenaline can markedly influence the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>displacement</b> of the arterial wall and the resulting shear strain, and thus shear stress, within the arterial wall. This opens up a new field within cardiovascular research, revealing a previously unknown mechanism in the circulatory system.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{physical}} and tactical performances of a professional football team under congested and non-congested fixture periods. Six home matches of an English professional football team were analysed during competitive season (3 matches distancing three days from the previous fixture and 3 matches distancing six or more days from the previous fixture). Players’ physical performances were measured by the total distance covered and distance covered at different speed categories. Tactical performances were measured by the percentage of time of players’ movement synchronisation of lateral and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>displacements.</b> This variable was calculated considering all the possible pairs of outfield players, for the overall match and at different speed categories. Results showed no differences in the physical performance, although players’ spent more time synchronised during the non-congested fixtures compared to congested fixtures, both for lateral (41. 26 % to 38. 51 %, ES: − 0. 3, P < 0. 001) and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>displacements</b> (77. 22 % to 74. 48 %, ES: − 0. 5, P < 0. 001). These coordination differences were particularly evident at the lower speed categories and in dyads composed by positions that tend to be further apart during the match, typically central and wing positioned players. Tactical performance seems to be affected by fixtures distribution, with players’ spending more time synchronised during the non-congested fixtures. As players’ cover the same amount of distance at similar intensities in both fixtures distribution, this reduction of synchronisation may be associated with an increased perception of fatigue and consequent adaptation strategies...|$|R
