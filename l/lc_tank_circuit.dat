40|$|Energy {{harvesting}} {{has drawn}} significant interest for {{its potential to}} power autonomous low-power applications. Vibration energy harvesting is particularly well suited to industrial condition sensing, environmental monitoring and household environments where low-level vibrations are commonly found. While significant {{progress has been made}} in making vibration harvesters more efficient, most designs are still based on a single constant vibration frequency. However, most vibration sources do not have a constant frequency nor a single harmonic. Therefore, the inability to deal with non-ideal vibration sources has become a major technological obstacle for vibration energy harvesters to be widely applicable. To advance the state of vibration energy harvesting, this thesis presents a design methodology that is capable of dealing with two major non-ideal vibration characteristics: single harmonic frequency shifting and multi-frequency/broadband excitation. This methodology includes a broad-band impedance matching theory and a power electronics architecture to implement that theory. The generalized impedance matching theory extends the well known single frequency impedance matching model to a multi-frequency impedance matching model. By connecting <b>LC</b> <b>tank</b> <b>circuits</b> to the harvester output, additional resonant frequencies are created thereby enabling the energy harvesting system to effectively harvest energy from multi-harmonic vibration sources. However, the required inductors in the <b>LC</b> <b>tank</b> <b>circuits</b> are often too large (> 10 H) to be implemented with discrete components. The power electronics proposed here addresses this issue by synthesizing the <b>tank</b> <b>circuits</b> with a power factor correction (PFC) circuit. This circuit mainly consists of an H-bridge, which contains four FETs, and a control loop that turns the FETs on and off at the right time such that the load voltage and current display the characteristics of the multiple <b>tank</b> <b>circuits.</b> By using this proposed power electronics, we demonstrate dual-frequency energy harvesting from a single mechanically resonant harvester. Simulation and experimental results match well and demonstrate that the proposed power electronics is capable of implementing higher order multi-resonant energy harvesting systems. In conclusion, this thesis presents both a theoretical foundation and a power electronics architecture that enables simultaneous effective multi-frequency energy harvesting with a single mechanically resonant harvester. The tunability of the power electronics also provides the possibility of dynamic real-time tuning which is useful to track non-stationary vibration sources. by Samuel C. Chang. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{report on}} the design, {{analytical}} modeling, numerical simulation, fabrication, and experimental characterization of chip-scale microwave resonators that exhibit high quality-factors (Q-factors) in the microwave frequency range. We demonstrate high Q-factors by tuning these microwave resonators with the film capacitance of their <b>LC</b> <b>tank</b> <b>circuits</b> rather than the conventional approach of using external capaci-tors for tuning. Our chip-scale resonator design further minimizes en-ergy losses and reduces the effect of skin depth leading to high Q-fac-tors even for significantly reduced device areas. Using our new design methodology, we observe that despite the higher resonance frequency and smaller chip size, the Q-factor is improved compared with the pre-vious literature using traditional approaches. For our 540 m 540 m resonator chip, we theoretically compute a Q-factor of 52. 40 at the calculated resonance frequency of 6. 70 GHz and experimentally demon-strate a Q-factor of 47. 10 at the measured resonance frequency of 6. 97 GHz.

No post-processing or special packaging of any kind is required beyond the standard CMOS process. Resonant body transistor (RBT) is constructed by using active field-effect-transistor (FET) sensing. A phononic crystal (PnC) implemented in the CMOS back-end-of-line (BEOL) layers along with the bulk wafer are used to create a phononic waveguide. The latter confines acoustic vibrations in the CMOS front-end-of-line (FEOL) layers.

40|$|In {{mixed signal}} {{integrated}} circuits, {{the role of}} passives has become increasingly important. In particular, the characterization and implementation of an embedded planar coil inductor presents several challenges. The present work is a comprehensive study of micro inductors that includes analytical modeling, numerical simulation, in-house fabrication processes, circuit implementation in silicon, and RF measurement techniques. Although the inductor is widely integrated on silicon, {{there is still a}} need for closed form expressions for inductance and the quality factor. In addition, amongst the numerous commercially available simulation packages, there still is a need to identify the tool that best suits the design and implementation of micro-inductors on silicon. In this work, an analytical model is presented based on a desegmentation technique, which removes segments from a rectangular cavity to create the inductor coil geometry. Defining the Green 2 ̆ 7 s function for each segment, the boundary conditions are applied to obtain a closed form expression for the Z matrix from which the inductance and Q have been obtained. For a numerical modeling, Ansoft 2 ̆ 7 s High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) is chosen as the preferred tool for an accurate and frequency dependent analysis. Several inductor geometrics have been modeled analytically and have been validated with HFSS where in each case there is excellent agreement. The model has also been successfully applied to irregularly shaped power planes that commonly occur in mixed signal circuits. The present work has established a fabrication process for micro-inductors using technologies available in the Semiconductor and Microsystems Fabrication Laboratory (SMFL) at RIT. A fabrication process has been developed to integrate inductors, transformers, capacitors, and PMOS (P-type Metal Oxide Semiconductor) transistors. Inductors and transformers have been made from copper and imbedded in a thick PECVD SiO₂ film. The process allows for an optional aluminum ground plane under the copper structures. Capacitors have been formed using the gate oxide as a dielectric and heavily doped silicon and aluminum as the electrodes. PMOS transistors have been implemented to control two varieties of <b>LC</b> <b>tank</b> <b>circuits</b> (parallel and series). The final contribution of the present work is establishing RF test methods for measuring inductance, and calculating the quality factor (Q). Experimental RF testing is performed using high frequency Cascade Microtech ground-signal-ground (GSG) probes and the 9100 probe station. Data has been captured using an Agilent 8363 B network analyzer with a frequency range from 10 MHz to 40 GHz.

In this paper comparison is made between different architectures of CMOS <b>LC</b> <b>tank</b> VCO such as differentional cross coupled, complementary cross coupled,cross coupled with pseudo resistance and Quadrature VCO with reconfigurable <b>LC</b> <b>tank</b> which are used to design high performance <b>LC</b> <b>tank</b> VCO for low power RF transmitter. From the comparison table 1,we note that complementary cross coupled LC VCO provides best tuning range i. e. 21 % and cross coupled with pseudo resistance LC VCO provides lowest phase i. e. - 125. 5 dBc/Hz among the other VCOs, it also has minimum power consumption, highest tuning range and best FOM i. e. - 190. 84...|$|R
