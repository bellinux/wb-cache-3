40|$|There {{are four}} {{recognized}} clonal lineages of the pathogen Phytophthora ramorum. The two major lineages present in North America are NA 1 and NA 2. With a few exceptions, NA 1 {{is found in}} natural forest ecosystems and nurseries, and NA 2 is generally restricted to nurseries. Isolates from the NA 1 and NA 2 lineages were used to infect rhododendron, camellia, and California bay <b>laurel</b> in detached <b>leaf</b> assays to {{study the effects of}} lineage, temperature, and host on pathogenicity and host susceptibility. Isolates within both lineages were highly variable in their ability to form lesions on each host. There was also a tendency toward reduced lesion size in successive trials, suggesting degeneration of isolates over time. Temperature had a significant effect on lesion size, with a response that varied depending on the host and isolate. Phenotypic differences between lineages appear to be heavily influenced by the representation of isolates used, host, and temperature. The importance of temperature, host, and lineage are discussed with respect to disease management, as well as future range expansions and migrations of the pathogen...|$|R

25|$|The biface leafpoint {{tools of}} central Europe are called blattspitzen. They are {{projectile}} points {{belonging to the}} Middle Palaeolithic with a leaf-shaped form.

Blattspitzen survived in some Upper Palaeolithic cultures. The pieces from the eastern European Szeletien culture (both blattspitzen and Micoquian bifaces) could be the link that connects the tradition of Lower and Middle Palaeolithic bifacial objects with those from the Upper Palaeolithic and beyond.|$|E
25|$|Of all the oaks, the Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) is {{the most}} {{resistant}} to drought and the continental-style climate. These forests, of a sub-Atlantic character, often represent the shift from Mediterranean vegetation to Atlantic vegetation. They cover a wide area of the peninsula and are of great importance, above all on the mountain ranges in {{the centre of the}} peninsula; from the interior of Galicia and extending south of the Cordillera Cantábrica they extend throughout the Sistema Central, reaching, to the south, (though scarce by the time they reach this region) the Sierra Nevada and Cádiz. They usually extend from some 700 to 800 metres to some 1500 to 1600 m in altitude. They prefer siliceous soil and, as altitude increases, they replace the damp oak forests and cork oak; on the high ground they give way to Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) forests or to los piornales serranos with creeping juniper. In areas where the influence of the Atlantic is more evident, they are taken over by heather and Erica australis; in the remainder, in clearings and in more degraded phases, rock rose (Cistaceae) mixed with <b>laurel</b> <b>leaf</b> and Spanish lavender (Lavandula stoechas) is more frequent. Their natural range is usually covered by forests of Scots pine or maritime pine.|$|E
