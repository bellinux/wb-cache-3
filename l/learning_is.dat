40|$|<b>Learning</b> to <b>learn</b> <b>is</b> a core competence, {{identified}} by the EU, for future citizens of Europe. However there is little consensus on what <b>learning</b> to <b>learn</b> <b>is,</b> and {{how it should be}} ‘taught’ and assessed. This study explores the findings from three related projects, in China, Italy, Spain and England which used the Effective Lifelong Learning Inventory to explore the learning power of students in primary classrooms. The study shows that <b>learning</b> to <b>learn</b> <b>is</b> culture specific and that extensive efforts should be put into the professional learning and practices of teachers if <b>learning</b> to <b>learn</b> <b>is</b> to become a key outcome of education and training across Europe...|$|R

5|$|While chavrusa-style <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> {{traditionally}} {{practiced by}} men and boys, it has also become popular in women's yeshivas that study Talmudic texts. In the 2000s it was extended to telephone and internet hookups in which partners study Talmud {{as well as other}} traditional Jewish texts.|$|E
5|$|Chavrusa {{learning}} {{tends to}} be loud and animated, as the study partners read the Talmudic text and the commentaries aloud {{to each other and}} then analyze, question, debate, and defend their points of view to arrive at a mutual understanding of the text. In the heat of discussion, they may wave their hands or even shout at each other. Depending {{on the size of the}} yeshiva, dozens or even hundreds of chavrusas can be heard discussing and debating each other's opinions. One of the skills of chavrusa <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> the ability to block out all other discussions in the study hall and focus on one's study partner alone.|$|E

5000|$|With this said, [...] "language {{acquisition}} is {{a matter}} of growth and maturation of relatively fixed capacities, under appropriate external conditions". The 17th century's amenable approach to language <b>learning</b> <b>was</b> very non-conforming, as the overall perception was that knowledge arose on the basis of scattered, inadequate data. Properties conducive to what <b>is</b> <b>learned</b> <b>were</b> attributed to the mind. Theories of perception and <b>learning</b> <b>were</b> essentially the same, though it was an acknowledged difference that would consequently become indistinct during acquisition.|$|R
5|$|Chavrusa-style <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> {{particularly}} {{suited to}} Talmud study, {{as the latter}} is a text filled with conflicting opinions and seemingly contradictory statements on principles of Jewish law. Besides tracking the back-and-forth debates, a student of Talmud must be able to analyze each opinion and present hypotheses to reconcile it in light of the others. The chavrusa relationship gives each student a platform to clarify and explain his position to a partner; then the two go on to question, defend, convince, amend, fine-tune, and even arrive at new conclusions through rigorous intellectual collaboration.|$|E
5|$|Service <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the fastest}} growing {{community}} service outlets at the college; students enjoy being able to accomplish community service while receiving credits in the classroom. Thus, students can learn in class while also learning and experiencing things in real-life situations. Eleven academic departments and more than twenty courses at Saint Anselm offer service-learning opportunities.|$|E

They are evaluated based on examinations, projects, quizzes, presentations, and class participation under a relative grading system. Academic <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> supplemented by live projects, management competitions, guest lectures, and interactions with alumni and industry leaders organised by committees.

Prior to the British Mandate period, boys would {{normally}} receive education in a kuttab, an elementary-type school with Islamic law and tradition having {{a major influence on}} the curriculum. Today, there is one elementary school (Bani Zeid Elementary School) and one secondary school (Bashir al-Barghouti Secondary School) in the town of Bani Zeid, both run by the government. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Education and Higher Education, in the 2010-2011 academic year there were 26 classes occupied by 691 students, both male and female. There was 45 teaching staff. There are no kindergartens in Bani Zeid. The closest institution for higher <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> Birzeit University in the village of Bir Zeit to the southeast.|$|E
