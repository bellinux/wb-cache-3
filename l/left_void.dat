6000|$|When he {{returned}} to Fasque in the autumn he found {{that his father had}} taken 'a decided step, nay a stride, in old age'; not having lost any of his interest in politics, but grown quite mild. The old man was nearing his eighty-seventh year. 'The very wreck of his powerful and simple nature is full of grandeur.... Mischief is at work upon his brain--that indefatigable brain which has had to stand all the wear and pressure of his long life.' In the spring of 1851 he finds him 'very like a spent cannon-ball, with a great and sometimes almost frightful energy remaining in him: though weak in comparison with what he was, he hits a very hard knock to those who come across him.' When December came, the veteran was taken seriously ill, and the hope disappeared of seeing him even reach his eighty-seventh birthday (Dec. 11). On the 7th he died. As Mr. Gladstone wrote to Phillimore, 'though with little left either of sight or hearing, and only able to walk from one room to another or to his brougham for a short drive, though his memory was gone, his hold upon language even for common purposes imperfect, the reasoning power much decayed, and even his perception of personality rather indistinct, yet so much remained about him {{as one of the most}} manful, energetic, affectionate, and simple-hearted among human beings, that he still filled a great space to the eye, mind, and heart, and a great space is accordingly <b>left</b> <b>void</b> by his withdrawal.' 'The death of my father,' Mr. Gladstone wrote to his brother John, 'is the loss of a great object of love, and it is the shattering of a great bond of union. Among few families of five persons will be found differences of character and opinion to the same aggregate amount as among us. We cannot shut our eyes to this fact; by opening them, I think we may the better strive to prevent such differences from begetting estrangement.' ...|$|E
60|$|An heroic poem (truly such) is {{undoubtedly}} the greatest work which {{the soul of}} man is capable to perform. The design of it is to form the mind to heroic virtue by example; it is conveyed in verse that it may delight while it instructs. The action of it is always one, entire, and great. The least and most trivial episodes or under- actions which are interwoven in it are parts either necessary or convenient {{to carry on the}} main design--either so necessary that without them the poem must be imperfect, or so convenient that no others can be imagined more suitable to the place in which they are. There is nothing to be <b>left</b> <b>void</b> in a firm building; even the cavities ought not to be filled with rubbish which is of a perishable kind--destructive to the strength--but with brick or stone (though of less pieces, yet of the same nature), and fitted to the crannies. Even the least portions of them must be of the epic kind; all things must be grave, majestical, and sublime; nothing of a foreign nature, like the trifling novels which Ariosto and others have inserted in their poems, by which the reader is misled into another sort of pleasure, opposite to that which is designed in an epic poem. One raises the soul and hardens it to virtue; the other softens it again and unbends it into vice. One conduces to the poet's aim (the completing of his work), which he is driving on, labouring, and hastening in every line; the other slackens his pace, diverts him from his way, and locks him up like a knight-errant in an enchanted castle when he should be pursuing his first adventure. Statius (as Bossu has well observed) was ambitions of trying his strength with his master, Virgil, as Virgil had before tried his with Homer. The Grecian gave the two Romans an example in the games which were celebrated at the funerals of Patroclus. Virgil imitated the invention of Homer, but changed the sports. But both the Greek and Latin poet took their occasions from the subject, though (to confess the truth) they were both ornamental, or, at best, convenient parts of it, rather than of necessity arising from it. Statius (who through his whole poem is noted for want of conduct and judgment), instead of staying, as he might have done, for the death of Capaneus, Hippomedon, Tydeus, or some other of his Seven Champions (who are heroes all alike), or more properly for the tragical end of the two brothers whose exequies the next successor had leisure to perform when the siege was raised, and in the interval betwixt the poet's first action and his second, went out of his way--as it were, on prepense malice--to commit a fault; for he took his opportunity to kill a royal infant by the means of a serpent (that author of all evil) to make way for those funeral honours which he intended for him. Now if this innocent had been of any relation to his Thebais, if he had either farthered or hindered the taking of the town, the poet might have found some sorry excuse at least for detaining the reader from the promised siege. On these terms this Capaneus of a poet engaged his two immortal predecessors, and his success was answerable to his enterprise.|$|E

50|$|Colchester's first {{signing of}} the {{campaign}} was young striker Dominic Smith on a one-year contract on 14 May.

On 22 May, Dominic Vose signed a contract extension that would tie him to the club until 2016, while Ryan Dickson decided against signing a fresh deal with Colchester in early June, instead opting to join League One rivals Crawley Town on a two-year contract. Academy goalkeeper Mark Cousins decided to end his ten-year association with the club to sign for Dagenham & Redbridge on a free transfer on 23 June.

Finally, ex-Dagenham goalkeeper Chris Lewington signed a two-year contract with Colchester to challenge Sam Walker for the number one position, having made almost 150 league and cup appearances for the Daggers. Josh Thompson did enough to prove to manager Dunne that he deserved a new contract, signing a one-year deal alongside David Wright on 3 July.

She had a tough time early in Season 6 when she was distracted by a loud, brattily obnoxious young girl and didn't diagnose the iron poisoning that led to the girl's death. Later on that year in “How The Finch Stole Christmas," [...] Cleo separated a young alcoholic patient from his alcoholic mother, who fed his addiction, during Christmastime. When no surgeons were available to perform a laparotomy on a dying patient {{in the aftermath of a}} stabbing in the ER, Dr. Finch performed an emergency thoracotomy in the OR to stabilize the patient until a surgeon could be found. She was at first reprimanded by Dr. Peter Benton, her boyfriend at the time, but he later apologized, blaming the stress of performing surgery on his friend, Dr. John Carter, a victim of the stabbing. Cleo barely responded and looked completely stunned and sorrowful, leading Peter to ask her what was wrong and her to brokenly tell him what had happened to Lucy Knight. She seemed vaguely annoyed that Dr. Carter was welcomed back to County after he went to rehab for his prescription medication addiction between Seasons 6 and 7, and briefly became angered by some issues she felt were racially tinged in Season 7, but neither storyline was maintained for very long.|$|E

Among them, Wolbachia is ubiquitous gram negative rickettsial endosymbiont taking its shelter in somatic and reproductive tissues of class insecta. Wolbachia induces variety of phenotypes within insects from reproductive parasitism to mutualism. Due to the infection dynamics of Wolbachia {{and its ability to}} induce reproductive anomalies in their hosts, it has been touted as the most effective bio-control agent for management of insect pests and vectors. However, for implementation of any Wolbachia based bio-control strategies it is essential to know its distribution, diversity and interactions with their hosts.

40|$|ABSTRACT Despite the {{suitability}} of various lattice geometries for coarse-grained modeling of proteins, the actual packing geometry of residues in folded structures has remained largely unexplored. A strong tendency to assume a regular packing geometry is shown here by optimally reorienting and superimposing clusters of neighboring residues from databank structures examined on a coarse-grained (single-site-per-residue) scale. The orienta-tion function (or order parameter) of the examined coordination clusters with respect to fcc lattice directions {{is found to be}} 0. 82. The observed geom-etry, which may be termed an incomplete distorted face-centered cubic (fcc) packing, is apparently fa-vored by the drive tomaximize packing density, in a fashion analogous to the way identical spheres pack densely and follow fcc geometry. About 2 / 3 of all residues obey this packing geometry, while the remainder occupy other context-dependent posi-tions. The preferred coordination directions show relatively small variations over the various amino acid types, consistent with uniform residue view-point. Both the extremes of solvent-exposed and completely buried residue neighborhoods approxi-mate the same generic packing, the only difference being in the numbers (and not the orientations) of coordination sites that are occupied (or <b>left</b> <b>void</b> for solvent occupancy). We observe the prevalence of a rather uniform (tight) residue packing density throughout the structure, including even the resi-dues packed near solvent-exposed regions.

40|$|Thesis(M. Urban Plan.) [...] University of Washington, 1999 The precariousness of Japanese American {{greenhouses}} {{presents an}} interesting {{challenge for the}} transforming urban greenhouse business sites. As our population growth has surrounded these small greenhouse growing plots, larger scale lots have become valuable targets for development. Multiple and single family housing are the most lucrative re-use {{of this type of}} property. Many Japanese American greenhouse sites have been adapted for uses such as these. Open space is another highly desirable use for this type of property, especially for sites that now find themselves in very dense, urban neighborhoods. The opportunity to capture the significance of these dinosaurs is often overlooked in the redevelopment of these sites. Small efforts to provide hints of former uses are sometimes incorporated but often the site is <b>left</b> <b>void</b> of any connection to the past culture or use of such places. Greenwood Greenhouses, located at 602 North 87 th Street, will serve as the study site for this thesis project. The City of Seattle is currently purchasing this site for open space {{to meet the needs of}} an under served Greenwood neighborhood. The Department of Parks and Recreation is relying on community input for a use and design of this space. The site has been owned by three different Japanese American families since 1928 and has been used to cultivate greenhouse plants since 1912. The focus of this thesis research has been to answer the proposed question: How can a greenhouse site be adapted and reused while meeting the needs of the community, protecting the historical significance and granting public ownership...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} {{study was to examine}} the perceived motivators contributing African American educators' decision to migrate from a suburban school district to an urban school district. The case study approach was used in an effort to capture the participants' voices and the motivators contributing to their decision to migrate to an urban school district after working as an educator in a suburban school district. The findings from this study will contribute to the existing body of literature by providing national policy makers, state policy makers, local school leaders and school district personnel information to create national, state, and local policy initiatives regarding African American educator personnel. The seven informants in this study were members of a large metropolitan area in the state of Texas and the suburban school districts bordering that metropolitan area. Since the enactment of the federal No Child Left Behind Act (2001), the achievement gap has been discussed and studied. However, few studies have investigated African American educator migration from suburban school districts to urban school districts and the strategies used by African American educators to close the achievement gap for African American students who attend those suburban schools <b>left</b> <b>void</b> of African American educators. The interpretational analysis process selected was based on Glaser and Strauss' constant comparative approach to analysis. The constant comparative data analysis generated five major themes of the motivators contributing to African American educator migration: (1) educators migrated to become social change agents, (2) educators migrated for growth opportunities, (3) educators migrated for financial increases, (4) educators migrated due to workplace relationships, and (5) educators migrated due to their perceptions and experiences in their suburban school district. My findings, based on the context of these seven African American educators, suggest that while the school district as an institution is not responsible or accountable for the African American educators migration, it can provide systems of support and initiatives for African America educators to assist them in overcoming the motivators inside of the school walls that contribute to their decision to leave...|$|E
