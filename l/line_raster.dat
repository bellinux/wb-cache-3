This image was created using {{an early version}} of what became Digital Effects' Vision software, in APL and Fortran on an IBM 370/158. A database of the Souvenir font; random number generation, a statistical basis to determine letter size, color, and position; and a hidden line algorithm combine to produce this scan <b>line</b> <b>raster</b> image, output to a plotter.|$|E
5000|$|The Oriental beetle (Anomala orientalis, {{often given}} as Exomala orientalis, under an invalid genus name [...] ) is a beetle about 0.7 - 1.1 cm (0.3 - 0.4 inches) long, with mottled, {{metallic}} brown- and black-colored elytra and a similarly-colored thorax and head during the adult stage. It is sometimes {{confused with the}} Japanese beetle. During the larval stage the oriental beetle can be identified by the parallel <b>line</b> <b>raster</b> pattern. It is native to Asia and was introduced to North America and has since spread to and become a pest in several mid-Atlantic states. Its invasive range extends from Maine to South Carolina and Wisconsin. In its larval stage, the grub feeds on the roots of grasses while the adults feed on roses, phlox, and petunias. Sex pheromone traps are available to capture and kill the Oriental beetle.|$|E

50|$|Counter-{{scanning}} (CS) is a scanning {{method that}} allows correcting raster distortions caused by drift of the probe of scanning microscope {{relative to the}} measured surface. During counter-scanning two surface scans, viz., direct scan and counter scan are obtained (see Fig. 1). The counter scan starts in {{the point where the}} direct scan ends. This point is called the coincidence point (CP). With the counter scan, the probe movement along the <b>raster</b> <b>line</b> and the probe movement from one <b>raster</b> <b>line</b> to the other <b>raster</b> <b>line</b> are carried out along the directions that are opposite to the movements in the direct scan. The obtained pair of images is called counter-scanned images (CSIs).|$|R

A small patch of text in the image is {{selected}} randomly and then rotated in the range of ±20° until the variance of the pixel intensities of the patch summed along the <b>raster</b> <b>lines</b> is maximised. See Figure 2.|$|R

As a lot of specialised programmes have been developed recently for various subjects, {{it is possible to}} find a special mapping software for cartography work and making maps. An example of GIS (geographic information system) mapping software is ArcMap. This thesis sums up possible applications of ArcMap in cartography. These in particular include orthophotomap connection and digitization, georeferencing followed by bitmap digitization, display methods of hypsometry (contour <b>line,</b> <b>raster,</b> TIN), generalization tools, topographical symbols creation and editing, making thematic maps and variety of ArcMap outcomes...|$|E
30|$|We {{measured}} the central macular thickness (CMT), parafoveal retinal thickness (PRT), and subfoveal choroidal thickness (SCT) {{during the course}} of the disease employing Cirrus HD-OCT Model 4000 (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG). We used the HD 5 <b>Line</b> <b>Raster</b> protocol (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG). CMT was defined as the retinal thickness at the center of foveola. PRT was defined as the retinal thickness at 1.2 mm nasal from the center of foveola in an OCT raster scan through the foveola. A third person randomized the order of OCT scan images. One of the co-authors manually {{measured the}} retinal thickness from the inner limiting membrane to the Bruch's membrane, and choroidal thickness from the Bruch's membrane to the choroid-scleral border (Figure  2).|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{describe}} the SD-OCT findings {{in patients with}} diffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis (DUSN) and evaluate CRT and RNFL thickness. Methods. Patients with clinical diagnosis of DUSN who were submitted to SD-OCT {{were included in the}} study. Complete ophthalmologic examination and SD-OCT were performed. Cirrus scan strategy protocols used were 200 × 200 macular cube, optic nerve head cube, and HD- 5 <b>line</b> <b>raster.</b> Results. Eight patients with DUSN were included. Mean RNFL thickness was 80. 25 [*]μm and 104. 75 [*]μm for affected and normal eyes, respectively. Late stage had mean RNFL thickness of 74. 83 [*]μm compared to 96. 5 [*]μm in early stage.

The system uses white light <b>raster</b> <b>line</b> triangulation in combination with biomechanical modeling techniques. White light <b>raster</b> <b>line</b> triangulation visualizes surfaces (e. g. the back surface) in an accurate and repeatable way, without detrimental effects, and without making contact to the human body.

40|$|The Variable Acuity Remote Viewing System is discussed. It was {{conceived}} as a technique for resolving the field of view/resolution/ bandwidth tradeoffs that exist in remote viewing systems. This system {{is based on the}} fact that integration of the human eye acuity function shows only about 130, 000 pixels are required to fully support the human vision. This quantity is well within the capabilities of conventional video systems. The technique utilizes a non-linear optical system in both the sensing and display equipment. The non-linearity is achieved by a special lens which translates a uniform pixel array on its image plane into the object field as a variable angular array. This lens will record the same angular detail the eye would see when viewing the same scene and compress this detail into a uniform matrix of equal sized picture elements on its image plane. This image can be scanned with a broadcast quality tv having a 525 <b>line</b> <b>raster</b> scan. Conventional transmission equipment can then also be used to send the image information to a remote location. When received, the image is projected by a light valve projector onto a hemispherical screen by an identical non-linear lens...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a demonstrator {{of a low}} cost image projection device that has been developed at the Fraunhofer Institute of Photonic Microsystems. The image projection {{is not based on}} the common line by <b>line</b> <b>raster</b> scanning of the image. Instead, a resonant 2 -dimensional micro scanning mirror is used for the deflection of a modulated laser beam. The mirror is operated at a low ratio of horizontal and vertical oscillation frequency. In particular, a ratio with a small shift from an integer value is used to enable a scan of the whole projection screen with a Lissajous pattern. The control circuit performs an excitation of both mirror axes by driving them with fixed frequency according to the response curves of the actuator. Programmable counters are used to generate the driving frequencies and to determine the actual beam position during the scanning process. That enables a very simple and low cost control circuit. A micro scanning mirror, fabricated at Fraunhofer IPMS, was used in the demonstrator set up. It is operated at oscillation frequencies of 1. 4 kHz (slow axis) and 9. 4 kHz (fast axis). The control circuit was realized and successfully tested with a FPGA implementation. The image resolution provided by the control circuit is 256 x 256 pixels...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} solve the above problems, a {{procedure}} of electronic correction for the thermal drift was developed. The idea of the procedure is successively to compare shifted current image with the reference image of the studied GeSi QDs array in time intervals (< 10  s), for which the array does not shift noticeably (> 5  nm), and to match these images. Accuracy of such matching can be evaluated as 5 – 10  nm. The ultimate lateral resolution of the scanning Auger microscopy images is determined by this value. Therefore, each <b>raster</b> <b>line</b> of the Auger map image was recorded for less than 10  s. Electronic correction of the probe position described above was performed after each <b>raster</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R

40|$|Line {{primitive}} extraction {{is one of}} {{the most}} important processes at the low level stage of line analysis in document image recognition. This paper proposes a new interpretive model of line continuation and applies it to line primitive extraction. The proposed model includes interpretation of line connectivity and line smoothness on the <b>raster</b> <b>line</b> images. The combination of these two features is the main contribution of this paper. Testing results of synthesized and real line images show that the proposed model performs well to separate X-type and T-type junctions and to group Ltype junctions. The generality of the proposed model is exhibited by its capability of extracting various <b>raster</b> <b>line</b> primitives, such as straight lines, curves and zigzag lines. 1...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim was {{to study}} choroidal {{thickness}} (CT) and its profile based on location in healthy Indian subjects using Cirrus high definition (HD) optical coherence tomography. Materials and Methods: A total of 211 eyes of 115 healthy subjects with no retinal or choroidal disease were consecutively scanned using Cirrus HD 1 <b>line</b> <b>raster</b> scan mode without pupillary dilation. Eyes with any ocular disease or axial length (AXL) > 24 mm or < 20 mm were excluded. Experienced technician measured CT from the lower border of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) to the lower border of choroid. CT was measured from the posterior edge of the RPE to the choroid/sclera junction at 500 -μm intervals up to 3000 μm temporal and nasal to the fovea. Generalized estimating equations were {{used to evaluate the}} correlation between CT at various locations and age, AXL, spherical equivalent, and macular thickness. Results: Mean age was 42. 8 ± 13. 6 years. Mean AXL was 22. 84 ± 0. 78 mm. Median spherical equivalent was 0. 16 ± 0. 64 D. Mean central macular thickness was 216. 4 ± 30. 03 μm. Choroidal was thinnest nasally and thickest subfoveally. On multivariate regression, age was the most significant factor affecting subfoveal CT (P = 0. 000). Regression analysis showed an approximate decrease in CT of 1. 18 μm every year. Conclusions: Our study provides CT profile in Indian healthy subjects in various age groups. CT depends on its location, subfoveal being the thickest and nasal being the thinnest. Age is a critical factor, which is negatively correlated with CT...|$|E

40|$|Bacterial colonies are {{spatially}} complex structures whose physiology {{is profoundly}} dependent on interactions between cells {{and with the}} underlying semi-solid substratum. Here, we use bacterial colonies {{as a model of}} a microbial community to evaluate the potential of laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to delineate elemental distributions within colonies with minimal pre-treatment. To reduce water content of the colony and limit undesirable absorption of laser energy, we compared methods of preparing 24 h-old colonies of Escherichia coli TG 1 on agar for laser ablation. Colonies on excised agar segments dried on chromatography paper were superior to colonies dried in a dessicator or by prolonged incubation, with respect to signal magnitude, signal:noise ratio and background signal. Having optimised laser scan speed (10 μm s− 1) and laser beam diameter (100 μm), further improvements were achieved by growing colonies on nylon membranes over agar, which were then transferred to the ablation chamber without further treatment. Repeated <b>line</b> <b>rasters</b> across individual membrane-supported colonies yielded three-dimensional elemental maps of colonies, revealing a convex morphology consistent with visual inspection. By normalising isotope counts for P, Mn, Zn, Fe and Ca against Mg, the most abundant cellular divalent cation, we sought elemental heterogeneity within the colony. The normalised concentration of Mn in the perimeter was higher than in the colony interior, whereas the converse was true for Ca. LA-ICP-MS is a novel and powerful method for probing elemental composition and organisation within microbial communities and should find numerous applications in, for example, biofilm studies...|$|R

It uses rotating-unbalanced-mass (RUM) devices for generating circular, <b>line,</b> or <b>raster</b> scan patterns and an auxiliary control system for target acquisition, keeping the scan centered on the target, and producing complementary motion for raster scanning. It is ideal for applications where the only possible way to accomplish the required scan is to physically scan the entire experiment or spacecraft as in X-ray and gamma ray experiments.
