40|$|In {{face of the}} new {{upgrades}} for RHIC the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>impedance</b> of {{the machine}} {{plays an important role}} in setting the threshold for instabilities and the efficacy of some systems. In this paper we describe the measurement of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>impedance</b> of the abort kicker for RHIC as well as computer simulations of the structure. The impedance measurement was done by the S{sub 21 } wire method covering the frequency range from 9 kHz to 2. 5 GHz. We observed a sharp resonance peak around 10 MHz and a broader peak around 20 MHz in both, the real and imaginary part, of the Z/n. These two peaks account for a maximum imaginary <b>longitudinal</b> <b>impedance</b> of j 15 {Omega}, a value an order of magnitude larger than the estimated value of j 0. 2 {Omega}, which indicates that the kicker is one of the main sources of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>impedance</b> in the machine. A computer model was constructed for simulations in the CST MWS program. Results for the magnet input and the also the beam impedance are compared to the measurements. A more detail study of the system properties and possible changes to reduce the coupling impedance are presented...|$|E

Stray capacitance across the oil gap was measured after each experiment and its admittance subtracted from the admittance of the fiber and oil gap.

In contrast to a single-bunch integrated impedance measurement these techniques resolve the impedances in the frequency domain.

Measurements of the quadrupole frequency shift with intensity in the following years suggest a significant increase in impedance (which nevertheless remains below the 1999 level) due to the installation of eight extraction kickers for beam transfer to the LHC.

40|$|In the SPS {{spectrum}} {{measurements of}} very long single bunches {{were used in}} the past to identify sources of longitudinal microwave instability. Shielding of the identified objects significantly improved the beam stability. However, longitudinal instabilities are still one of the limitations for high intensity LHC beams in the SPS. Recently the same measurement technique was used again, revealing a strong high frequency resonance. During the slow de-bunching with the RF switched off, the presence of different resonant impedances leads to a line density modulation at the resonant frequencies. Longitudinal profiles of bunches of various intensities were acquired. For sufficiently high intensities their spectra show a fast growing and strong modulation at 1. 4 GHz.

40|$|The {{pulsatile flow}} of blood through a tapered {{constricted}} narrow artery is investigated in this study, treating the blood as Carreau fluid model. The constriction in the artery {{is due to the}} formation of asymmetric stenosis in the lumen of the artery. The expressions obtained by Sankar (2016) for the various flow quantities are used to analyze the flow with different arterial geometry. The influence of various flow parameters on the velocity distribution, wall shear stress and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>impedance</b> to flow is discussed. The velocity of blood increases with the increase of the power law index and stenosis shape parameter and it decreases considerably with the increase of the maximum depth of the stenosis. The wall shear stress and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>impedance</b> to flow decrease with the increase stenosis shape parameter, amplitude of the pulsatile pressure gradient, flow rate, power law index and Weissenberg number. The estimates of the percentage of increase in the wall shear stress and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>impedance</b> to flow increase with the increase of the angle tapering and these increase significantly with the increase of the maximum depth of the stenosis.

40|$|The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>impedance</b> of a kicker magnet {{system for}} the {{proposed}} KAON factory has been measured from 0. 3 to 200 MHz. The measurement was done by trans-forming the kicker magnet under test into a coaxial line {{in order to measure}} the transmission parameter, 5 â€™ 21 through the line. The measurement was performed in two fre-quency ranges. From 0. 3 to 50 MHz the magnet was trans-formed into a 50 Q coaxial line, and from 45 to 200 MHz into a 180 R coaxial line. Resonances in the longitudi-nal impedance spectrum are due to the electrical resonant modes of the kicker magnet system. The effect on the lon-gitudinal impedance of a speed-up network and a saturat-ing inductor, installed on the input to the kicker magnet to improve it,s kick performance, was determined. The speed-up network can damp some of the resonances whereas the saturating inductor can eliminate the resonances due to the input cable of the kicker magnet. Above 45 MHz where at-tenuation in the LC cells of the kicker magnet is strong, external components connected to the kicker magnet have negligible influence on the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>impedance.</b> Hence the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>impedance</b> spectrum of the kicker magnet in the 45 to 200 MHz frequency range does not depend on external components such as the speed-up network, the saturating inductor and the input and output cables.
