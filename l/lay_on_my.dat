6000|$|And {{the pool}} answered, 'But I loved Narcissus because, as he <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> banks {{and looked down}} at me, in the mirror of his eyes I saw ever my own beauty mirrored.' ...|$|E
6000|$|No {{positive}} responsibility <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulders, and yet I did {{not feel}} easy in my mind. [...] "It is of your own free will," [...] I said, as the chaise drove through the lodge-gates, [...] "that your ladyship goes to London?" ...|$|E
60|$|I bent my head: I sat {{thinking}} an hour longer. Reason still whispered me, <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder a withered hand, and frostily touching my {{ear with}} the chill blue lips of eld.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, this is it, Capet. I ain't easy; I ain't comfortable. That doctor <b>lays</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> mind. I {{wanted to}} know your plans. I've got a notion, and I think it's a sound one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, signior, I <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> you <b>my</b> {{sovereign}} behest to furbish up {{your lungs}} and other vocal organs, {{as they will}} be wanted <b>on</b> <b>my</b> royal service." ...|$|R
60|$|She put {{her arms}} round my neck, and rested her head quietly on my bosom. On the {{opposite}} wall hung the miniature portrait of her father. I bent over her, and {{saw that she was}} looking at it while her head <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> breast.|$|E
6000|$|... "That sounds right enough, Captain," [...] {{one of the}} convicts said, [...] "and just {{at present}} nothing would suit me better than to get {{so far away from}} this place that I can <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> back and take it easy for a spell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{house is}} watched, Master Shelton," [...] {{returned}} the outlaw. [...] "We {{are not alone}} to watch it; for even as I <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> belly on the wall I saw men prowling in the dark, and heard them whistle softly one to the other." ...|$|E
60|$|Still I hesitated, {{for some}} {{fear of the}} future <b>lay</b> heavy <b>on</b> <b>my</b> heart, warning me against this expedition.|$|R
5000|$|Frank Shamrock {{was criticized}} for pushing an {{unconscious}} Phil Baroni off him using his leg rather than allowing the referee to pull Phil off Frank. In a post-fight interview question regarding the incident, Shamrock stated that [...] "Phil was heavy on top of me... he was squishing {{the life out of}} me... he was <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> leg and <b>on</b> <b>my</b> chest... that's it. And I thought it looked better on camera.".|$|R
6000|$|... "But plait a wand o' bonnie birk, [...] "And <b>lay</b> it <b>on</b> <b>my</b> breast; [...] "And shed a tear upon my grave, [...] "And wish my saul gude rest.|$|R
60|$|I {{had thought}} of them much as I <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> back {{recovering}} from the fever,--the fever for which Mrs. Temple was to blame. Yet I bore her no malice. And many other thoughts I had, probing back into childhood memories for the solving of problems there.|$|E
6000|$|... "The hour is near, brother," [...] Grace whispered, as she <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bosom. [...] "Remember, I die asking {{forgiveness}} as {{much for}} those who may have done me wrong, as for myself. Forget nothing that you have promised me; do nothing to cause Lucy and her father sorrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All my ventures failed, and {{my paper}} boats freighted {{with so many}} high hopes, went down one after another, leaving me to despair. The last wreck <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> table then,--a novel, worn with much journeying to and fro, on which I had staked my last chance, and lost it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Walter, {{will you}} take me in your strong arms and <b>lay</b> me <b>on</b> <b>my</b> little couch beside the window? I should {{love to see the}} cross again, and it is nearly day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; thank you. You can <b>lay</b> them <b>on</b> <b>my</b> desk. I'll look {{them over}} in Committee. You can go now, {{and if any}} one calls to see me say I'm busy." ...|$|R
60|$|Three {{minutes later}} we were safe on the further bank, which my mare had already reached, where I <b>lay</b> gasping <b>on</b> <b>my</b> face, ejaculating prayers of thankfulness and {{spitting}} out muddy water.|$|R
60|$|Such was my {{condition}} when I {{sat down to}} my dinner that day, {{in the kitchen of}} the old farm-house. Such was {{my condition}} when I <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bed in the old farm-house that night, stretched out opposite the narrow mullioned window, in the cold light of the moon, like a young vampire.|$|E
60|$|I {{did not go}} to sleep,--I did {{not feel}} sleepy at all,--I <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> back, looking up at the ceiling, and {{thinking}} of things. I wish I could remember some of the ideas that came to me as I lay there, because they were so amusing. I laughed at them myself till the bed shook.|$|E
6000|$|For hark! I {{will tell}} you low, low, [...] I am black, you see,-- [...] And the babe who <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bosom so, [...] Was far too white, too white for me; [...] As white as the ladies who scorned to pray [...] Beside me at church but yesterday, [...] Though my tears had washed a place for my knee.|$|E

60|$|She started forward, <b>laying</b> {{her hand}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> arm, and Dorothy {{gave a little}} cry.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Fetch quickly nine buffalo skins; smear {{them well}} with tar, and <b>lay</b> them <b>on</b> <b>my</b> back. Do not fear; you {{will succeed in}} this also; but, in the end, the emperor's desires will be his undoing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Again I saw a brown bird hover [...] Over {{the flowers}} at my feet; [...] I felt a brown bird hover [...] Over my heart, and sweet [...] Its shadow <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> heart. [...] I thought I {{saw on the}} clover [...] A brown bee pulling apart [...] The closed flesh of the clover [...] And {{burrowing}} in its heart.|$|E
60|$|All {{the whole}} I must admit {{it was not}} a {{situation}} that lent itself to eloquence. I <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> back and talked through bandages, and with some little difficulty, for my tongue and mouth had swollen. But I was feverish and in pain, and the emotional suspense I had been in so long with regard to her became now an unendurable impatience.|$|E
6000|$|I fired {{a shot at}} a Afghan, [...] The beggar 'e fired again, [...] An' I <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{bed with}} a 'ole in my 'ed, [...] An' missed the next campaign!

6000|$|Lady Sandgate fairly {{jumped at}} it. [...] "Your blessed cheque-book. <b>Lay</b> it <b>on</b> <b>my</b> desk," [...] {{she said to}} Gotch, though waiting till he had {{departed}} again before she resumed to her visitor: [...] "Mightn't we conclude before he comes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Ha, ha, {{the trick}} of the angels white! [...] They freed the white child's spirit so. [...] I said not a word, but day and night [...] I carried the body to and fro, [...] And it <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> heart like a stone, as chill. [...] --The sun may shine {{out as much as}} he will: [...] I am cold, though it {{happened}} a month ago.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not before Christmas at soonest. One {{would think}} the poor little fellow must {{have been aware of}} that; but the verdict cut him up very much. I thought he had better be quiet till {{the heat of the day}} was past, so he <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bed till six o'clock, and then he said he was better, but he hardly spoke all the way home.' ...|$|E
60|$|One night I awoke {{with the}} sweat {{starting}} from my brow, trying to collect my senses, and I <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> blanket listening to such plaintive and heart-rending cries as I had never known. Human cries they were, cries as {{of children in}} distress, and I rose to a sitting posture on the deck with my hair standing up straight, to discover Nick beside me in the same position.|$|E
6000|$|... "What imperence!" [...] {{said that}} worthy lady; [...] "you'll <b>lay</b> hands <b>on</b> <b>my</b> daughter, will you? (one, two). You'll insult {{a woman in}} distress, will you, you little coward? (one, two). Take that, and mind your manners, you filthy monster!" ...|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{professional}} visiting list--I had at {{that time}} {{a considerable number of}} these. One of them, who was uncommonly small, unusually miserable, and pathetically feeble, <b>lay</b> heavy <b>on</b> <b>my</b> spirit just then. She had a remarkably bad cold at the time, which betrayed itself chiefly in a frequent, but feeble, sneeze.|$|R
