5|$|Watership Down was Richard Adams' first novel. Although it was {{rejected}} by several publishers before Collings accepted it, it won the annual Carnegie Medal, annual Guardian Prize, and other book awards. It was adapted into the 1978 animated film Watership Down. <b>Later</b> <b>there</b> was a television series also titled Watership Down which ran from 1999 to 2001.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} <b>later</b> <b>there</b> was a debate between Heaviside and Peter Guthrie Tait about the {{relative}} merits of vector analysis and quaternions. The result was the realisation that {{there was no need for}} the greater physical insights provided by quaternions if the theory was purely local, and vector analysis became commonplace. Maxwell was proven correct, and his quantitative connection between light and electromagnetism is considered one of the great accomplishments of 19th century mathematical physics.|$|E

5|$|As the Tsaress {{planned to}} take {{personal}} care of the church, the church has no parish, {{and there is no}} belltower to call the congregation to divine service. But she died before the construction ended, so the church was never cared for by Elizabeth Petrovna. After Elizabeth's death, the Kiev court took no interest maintaining in the church, last consecrated in 1767. <b>Later,</b> <b>there</b> were not enough funds to maintain the church, which left the maintaining of the church to private and voluntary funds, such as Andrey Muraviov.|$|E
5|$|Carl Edwards led {{the first}} lap from pole {{position}} ahead of Kurt Busch who started {{second on the}} grid. The race was caution free until lap 29 (debris), and then 48 laps later a multiple crash occurred involving 13 drivers. <b>Later</b> <b>there</b> were several lead changes, and another four cautions. With nine laps remaining, Gordon took the lead from Kyle Busch to win his first race of the season, his first in more than 60 races.|$|E
5|$|Chinese, Indian and Comorian {{minorities}} {{are present in}} Madagascar, {{as well as a}} small European (primarily French) populace. Emigration in the late 20th century has reduced these minority populations, occasionally in abrupt waves, such as the exodus of Comorans in 1976, following anti-Comoran riots in Mahajanga. By comparison, there has been no significant emigration of Malagasy peoples. The number of Europeans has declined since independence, reduced from 68,430 in 1958 to 17,000 three decades <b>later.</b> <b>There</b> were an estimated 25,000Comorans, 18,000Indians, and 9,000Chinese living in Madagascar in the mid-1980s.|$|E

5000|$|Contemporary {{critics of}} the film have noted a homoerotic subtext between the film's two central male characters. In a 2013 {{retrospective}} on the film, the publication Culture Crossfire said of the film: [...] "Twelve years <b>later,</b> <b>there’s</b> nothing about The Forsaken that’s particularly memorable {{other than the fact}} that it’s an in-denial coming out tale that just happens to have vampires." ...|$|R

5|$|Mockingbird nests {{are also}} often parasitized by cowbirds. The parents {{are found to}} reject {{parasitic}} eggs at an intermediate rate. A recent study has shown that foreign eggs {{are more likely to}} be rejected from a nest later in the breeding season than from earlier in a breeding season. Early nesting hosts may not have learned the pattern and coloration of their first clutch yet, so are less likely to reject foreign eggs. There is also a seasonal threshold in terms of the overlap between the breeding seasons of the northern mockingbirds and their parasites. If the breeding season of the parasites starts <b>later,</b> <b>there</b> is less likelihood of parasitism. Hence, it pays the hosts to have relatively lower sensitivity to parasitic eggs.|$|E
5|$|Neither side made a {{substitution}} at half time. In the 56th minute, Cesc Fàbregas – who had {{a bicycle}} kick saved by Lloris – set up Diego Costa, whose shot from {{the left of the}} area deflected off Tottenham right-back Kyle Walker and into the net to double Chelsea's advantage. After conceding their second goal, Tottenham made a series of attacking substitutions – Andros Townsend, Ryan Mason and Chadli made way for Mousa Dembélé, Érik Lamela and Roberto Soldado respectively – but could not change the score. In the 74th minute, Dier's knee caught César Azpilicueta, drawing blood; the Chelsea left-back left the pitch to be bandaged and returned two minutes <b>later.</b> <b>There</b> were four minutes of added time, in which Chelsea substituted Costa for Didier Drogba.|$|E
5|$|On 27 December {{the poster}} bearing Gardstein's picture {{was seen by}} his landlord, who alerted police. Wensley and his colleagues visited the lodgings on Gold Street, Stepney and found knives, a gun, ammunition, false {{passports}} and revolutionary publications. Two days <b>later</b> <b>there</b> was another hearing at the Guildhall police court. In addition to Federoff, Peters and Dubof, present in the dock were Milstein and Trassjonsky. With some of the defendants having a low standard of English, interpreters were used throughout the proceedings. At {{the end of the}} day the case was adjourned until 6 January 1911.|$|E

5|$|Over {{a century}} <b>later,</b> <b>there</b> are {{records of the}} walls being {{repaired}} in the 1520s and 1530s by Henry VIII {{in preparation for a}} potential royal visit, but the ascension of the Tudor dynasty to the English throne had heralded a change in the way Wales was administered. The Tudors were Welsh in origin, and their rule eased hostilities between the Welsh and English. The military importance of Conwy's defences declined and the townspeople used the walls' defensive ditches for discarding rubbish. Parts of the town walls were robbed for their stone during this period for use in the construction of local buildings.|$|E
5|$|The account ledgers of Tallinn {{city council}} contain entries about the Kõpu {{lighthouse}} from 1507 to 1533, showing money {{was spent on}} the beacon of Hiiumaa from 13 May 1514 until 12 October 1532. The amounts show {{the majority of the}} work took place from 1514 to 1519; <b>later</b> <b>there</b> are only a couple of bigger expenditures on the beacon. A fire was first lit in the autumn of 1531; it was simply a bonfire on top of the tower.|$|E
5|$|The postwar {{drive-in}} theater boom {{was vital}} to the expanding independent B movie industry. In January 1945, there were 96 drive-ins in the United States; a decade <b>later,</b> <b>there</b> were more than 3,700. Unpretentious pictures with simple, familiar plots and reliable shock effects were ideally suited for auto-based film viewing, with all its attendant distractions. The phenomenon of the drive-in movie {{became one of the}} defining symbols of American popular culture in the 1950s. At the same time, many local television stations began showing B genre films in late-night slots, popularizing the notion of the midnight movie.|$|E

5|$|A {{farmer and}} his son were {{ploughing}} a field on the Isle of Mull using a team of four horses beside Loch Freisa, but work stalled {{after one of the}} horses lost a shoe and was unable to continue. Noticing a horse grazing nearby they decided to try using it as a replacement. Once harnessed to the wooden plough the horse appeared to be familiar with the task, and initially worked steadily. As it began to work towards an area closest to the loch, it became restless and the farmer gently used a whip to encourage the animal to continue. It reacted by immediately transforming into a gigantic boobrie, giving out a loud bellow and diving into the loch, pulling the plough and the other three horses with it. The frightened farmer {{and his son}} watched as the creature swam to the centre of the loch then dived underwater, taking the other horses and plough with it. Seven hours <b>later</b> <b>there</b> was still no sign of the three horses.|$|E
5|$|After finding Sharon's trashed hotel room, Mulder {{meets with}} Millar, who {{tells him that}} the door was pulled off the plane from the outside while it was in flight. Later, Frish finds his {{colleague}} dead from a faked suicide. A group of commandos arrive to capture Frish, but he escapes. Frish goes to see Mulder and Scully, telling them that he lied before and that his commanding officer had ordered him to track the plane's coordinates as it was being intercepted by a second aircraft. Seconds <b>later,</b> <b>there</b> was an explosion and the plane disappeared from his radar. Mulder believes that a third aircraft, a UFO, approached the plane and was destroyed by the second aircraft, also causing the Flight 549 crash. The agents leave with Frish and are soon chased by the commandos. Meanwhile, Millar returns to the crash site and encounters a UFO. He finds Sharon nearby, having just been returned by her abductors.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Spee {{took his}} ships north to Valparaiso. Since Chile was neutral, only three ships could enter the port at a time; Spee took Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, and Nürnberg in {{first on the}} morning of 3 November, leaving Dresden and Leipzig with the colliers at Mas a Fuera. There, Spee's ships could take on coal while he conferred with the Admiralty Staff in Germany to {{determine}} the strength of remaining British forces in the region. The ships remained in the port for only 24 hours, in accordance with the neutrality restrictions, and arrived at Mas a Fuera on 6 November, where they took on more coal from captured British and French steamers. On 10 November, Dresden and Leipzig were detached for a stop in Valparaiso, and five days later, Spee took the rest of the squadron south to St. Quentin Bay in the Gulf of Penas. On 18 November, Dresden and Leipzig met Spee while en route and the squadron reached St. Quentin Bay three days <b>later.</b> <b>There,</b> they took on more coal, since the voyage around Cape Horn would be a long one and it was unclear when they would have another opportunity to coal.|$|E
