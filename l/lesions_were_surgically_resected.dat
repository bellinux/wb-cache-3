40|$|We {{describe}} {{a case of}} multidrug-resistant tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium bovis in a human immunodeficiency virus– infected woman with good immunologic status. The patient presented with a hard mass measuring 10 cm in diameter on the lower left ribs and a lung nodule measuring 3 cm in diameter in the left superior lobe. No adequate pharmaco-logical treatment was available. Both <b>lesions</b> <b>were</b> <b>surgically</b> <b>resected.</b> The patient has remained asymptomatic (without fever, cough, lymphadenopathy, or cutaneous masses) for 20 months, after discharge from the hospital. The enhanced incidence and susceptibility to tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients has dramatically changed the epidemi-ology of tuberculosis and has increased the risk of nosocomial transmission in health care facilities [1, 2].

40|$|Although FDG PET is {{increasingly}} {{used for the}} staging of many types of sarcoma, little has been written regarding the FDG PET imaging characteristics of solitary fibrous tumor. We report a patient undergoing FDG PET/CT surveillance for squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue who was incidentally found to have two soft tissue masses in the retroperitoneum and pancreatic tail. Due to their low degree of FDG avidity, they were followed conservatively for approximately one year as they gradually increased in size. Technetium- 99 m sulfur colloid SPECT helped confirm that the pancreatic tail mass was not a splenule, after which both <b>lesions</b> <b>were</b> <b>surgically</b> <b>resected</b> and found to be extrathoracic solitary fibrous tumors without malignant features. These findings suggest that, as with other low-grade sarcomas, benign extrathoracic solitary fibrous tumors exhibit relatively little glycolytic metabolism in vivo...|$|E
40|$|A 26 -year-old man {{presented}} with signs of raised intracranial pressure. CT and MRI {{of the head}} demonstrated two separate lesions in the posterior fossa. The radiological differential diagnoses included multiple meningiomas, schwannomas, neurofibromas and subependymomas. Both <b>lesions</b> <b>were</b> <b>surgically</b> <b>resected.</b> Histopathological examination revealed localisations of a leptomeningeal melanocytoma. Leptomeningeal melanocytoma is a rare tumour of the central nervous system. Generally, it has a good prognosis if radical resection can be performed. In cases of subtotal resection, adjuvant radiotherapy should be considered. Local recurrences are common. Less frequently, leptomeningeal metastases and, on rare occasions, distant metastases or progression to malignant melanoma have been described. We describe an unusual case with multiple localisations of melanocytoma in the posterior fossa and spinal canal, with the emphasis being on the radiological findings and diagnosis of this rare tumour.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Intimal {{hyperplasia}} {{is known}} to promote in-stent restenosis after vascular stent implantation. Although previous studies have presented a variety of evidence that suggests the mechanisms of intimal lesion formation, it is still controversial which factor(s) predominantly {{contribute to the development}} of in-stent restenosis. In this study, we hypothesized that heterogenous mechanisms coexist in the same lesion and then assessed the validity with resected whole arteries with in-stent lesions. Methods: Whole arterial specimens with in-stent <b>lesions</b> <b>were</b> <b>surgically</b> <b>resected</b> from five patients who had undergone implantation of a Palmaz-Schatz stent 7 to 19 months previously and were histologically analyzed. For assessment of the pathogenetic heterogeneity of in-stent lesions, we divided each cross section into three parts: the inner intima within 250 μm from the luminal surface (zone A), the area surrounding the stent struts within 250 μm from the strut hole (zone B), and the remaining part of the intimal layer (zone C). We then evaluated cell density, cell replication, and cellular composition in each zone. Cell replication and cellular composition were analyzed with immunohistologic staining with antibodies against proliferating cell nuclear antigen and cell-specific antibodies. Each section was also stained with Alcian blue or Elastica van Gieson method for detection of matrix components. Results: In all samples, the cell density of zone A was significantly higher than that of zone B (P <. 05). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining results showed significantly higher cell replication in zone A as compared with that in other zones (P <. 05). To the contrary, cell-specific immunostaining results revealed marked accumulation of leukocytes, macrophages, and T lymphocytes in zone B (P <. 05). Regarding matrix components, proteoglycan was predominantly stained around stent struts and in the inner intima. Conclusion: The data of this study showed that two different pathogenetic processes in different zones possibly contributed to in-stent lesion formation at the same time. One process was an increase of cell number in the inner intima, which was the result of a prolonged increase of cell replication. The other process was accumulation of matrix around stent struts, which was suggested to be linked to infiltration of inflammatory cells in the same zone. (J Vasc Surg 2002; 35 : 672 - 8. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Colorectal {{metastasis}} of lobular {{carcinoma of}} the breast is a diagnostic challenge. It may macroscopically simulate primary colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease. In some cases, the interval between the primary breast cancer and metastatic colorectal <b>lesions</b> <b>is</b> so long that the critical records for diagnosis including history might be lost or missed. Case presentation Reported herein {{is a case of}} metastatic lobular {{carcinoma of the}} breast masquerading as a primary rectal cancer developed in a 62 -year-old Japanese woman. The case initially presented as a circumferential rectal lesion, and information on the patient’s history of breast cancer was not noted. As the result of endoscopic biopsy, diagnosis of poorly differentiated rectal adenocarcinoma <b>was</b> made. The <b>lesion</b> <b>was</b> <b>surgically</b> <b>resected</b> after chemo-radiotherapy. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stain revealed a single-file arrangement of the tumor cells, reminiscent of lobular carcinoma of the breast. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed an immunophenotype consistent with lobular carcinoma of the breast. Because further review of the patient’s history revealed an occurrence of ‘poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the breast’, which she had experienced 24 years earlier, the final diagnosis of the <b>lesion</b> <b>was</b> made as rectal metastasis from lobular breast carcinoma. Conclusions Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the colorectum is rarer than that of the stomach. Linitis plastica-type cancer of the colorectum is also rarer than that of the stomach. A lesson from the present case is that before we conclude a linitis plastica-type cancer of poorly differentiated type as a primary colorectal cancer, it is critical to exclude a possibility of metastatic colorectal cancer. </p...|$|R
40|$|Gatrointestinal duplications {{are rare}} {{congenital}} anomalies, usually detected prenatally {{or in the}} first two years of life, although they can be diagnosed even in older age.

40|$|Purpose To {{describe}} the ictal technetium- 99 m-ECD SPECT findings in polymicrogyria syndromes (PMG) during epileptic seizures. Methods We investigated 17 patients with PMG syndromes during presurgical workup, which included long-term video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring, neurological and psychiatry assessments, invasive EEG, and the subtraction of ictal-interictal SPECT coregistered to {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) (SISCOM). Results The analysis of the PMG cortex, using SISCOM, revealed intense hyperperfusion in the polymicrogyric lesion during epileptic seizures in all patients. Interestingly, other localizing investigations showed heterogeneous findings. Twelve patients underwent epilepsy surgery, three achieved seizure-freedom, five have worthwhile improvement, and four patients remained unchanged. Conclusions Our study strongly suggests the involvement of PMG in seizure generation or early propagation. Both conventional ictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and SISCOM appeared as the single contributive exam to suggest the localization of the epileptogenic zone. Despite {{the limited number of}} resective epilepsy surgery in our study (n= 9), we found a strong prognostic role of SISCOM in predicting surgical outcome. This result may be of great value on surgical decision-making {{of whether or not the}} whole or part of the PMG <b>lesion</b> should <b>be</b> <b>surgically</b> <b>resected...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: Congenital {{hyperinsulinism}} (CHI) requires rapid {{diagnosis and}} treatment to avoid irreversible neurological sequelae due to hypoglycaemia. Aetiological diagnosis is instrumental in directing the appropriate therapy. Current diagnostic algorithms provide {{a complete set of}} diagnostic tools including (i) biochemical assays, (ii) genetic facility and (iii) state-of-the-art imaging. They consider the response to a therapeutic diazoxide trial an early, crucial step before proceeding (or not) to specific genetic testing and eventually imaging, aimed at distinguishing diffuse vs focal CHI. However, interpretation of the diazoxide test is not trivial and can vary between research groups, which may lead to inappropriate decisions. Objective of this report is proposing a new algorithm in which early genetic screening, rather than diazoxide trial, dictates subsequent clinical decisions. Patients, Methods and Results: Two CHI patients weaned from parenteral glucose infusion and glucagon after starting diazoxide. No hypoglycaemia was registered during a 72 -h continuous glucose monitoring (CGMS), or hypoglycaemic episodes were present for no longer than 3 % of 72 -h. Normoglycaemia was obtained by low–medium dose diazoxide combined with frequent carbohydrate feeds for several years. We identified monoallelic, paternally inherited mutations in KATP channel genes, and 18 F-DOPA PET-CT revealed a focal <b>lesion</b> that <b>was</b> <b>surgically</b> <b>resected,</b> resulting in complete remission of hypoglycaemia. Conclusions: Although rare, some patients with focal <b>lesions</b> may <b>be</b> responsive to diazoxide. As a consequence, we propose an algorithm that is not based on a ‘formal’ diazoxide response but on genetic testing, in which patients carrying paternally inherited ABCC 8 or KCNJ 11 mutations should always be subjected to 18 F-DOPA PET-CT...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Cancers of the {{gastrointestinal}} tract are {{the second most}} prevalent malignancy with 289, 610 new cases last year and {{the second most common}} cause of cancer-related death with 150, 000 deaths last year in the United States. Prognosis for patients with these malignancies is poor and worsens significantly once the cancer has metastasized to the brain. We evaluated the outcome of patients following Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases (BM) in individuals with GI cancers to identify safety and effectivity of treatment and we assessed prognostic factors that affect tumor control and survival. OBJECTIVES: By the conclusion of this session, participants should be able to: 1) Identify an effective treatment for brain metastases from GI cancers in terms of increasing survival; 2) Identify which treatment provides the best local and distant control of CNS disease; 3) Discuss the effects of different prognostic factors on local control and survival. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of 58 brain metastases from 18 consecutive patients who underwent SRS treatment at BIDMC between 2006 and 2013. 11 / 18 patients underwent prior microsurgical resection for their metastases and 3 / 18 patients had undergone Whole Brain Radiation Therapy (WBRT). Overall Survival (OS), Local Control (LC), Distal control (DC), and prognostic factors such as age, number of brain metastases (BM), Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), Recursive Partition Analysis (RPA) and Disease Specific Graded Prognostic Assessment (Ds-GPA) class were evaluated. RESULTS: The median overall survival (mOS) for the entire cohort was 14 months after the diagnosis of BM. The mOS for patients receiving only SRS, Surgical Resection + SRS, and WBXRT + SRS were 8 months, 18 months, and 13 months respectively. The difference in overall survival between treatment groups was not found to be statistically significant. Increasing number of BM was a factor shown to negatively influence survival. Local control was achieved in 55 % of lesions after SRS, and in 75 % of <b>lesions</b> that <b>were</b> <b>surgically</b> <b>resected</b> followed by SRS boost to the resection cavity. The difference in local control between SRS alone vs. Surgery + SRS was found to be statistically significant (p = 0. 013). CONCLUSION: With a higher overall survival and significantly better local control rates, Surgery followed by SRS boost to the resection cavity should be considered as the treatment of choice in this specific subgroup of cancer patients as this study shows that they benefit from this more aggressive treatment option...|$|R
