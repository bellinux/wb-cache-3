25|$|The {{cocktail}} party effect is the phenomenon {{that a person}} hears his or her name even when not attending to the conversation. To study this, a screening measure for attentional control was given that tested a person’s ability {{to keep track of}} words while also doing math problems. Participants were separated into two groups---low and high span attentional control ability groups. They listened to two word lists read simultaneously by a male and a female voice and were told to ignore the male voice. Their name was read by the “ignored” male voice. Low span people were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> their name compared to high span people. This result suggests that people with lower attentional control ability have more trouble inhibiting information from the surrounding environment.|$|E

LGBT sex education includes safe sex practices for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals and general instruction in topics related to homosexuality. Studies have shown that many schools do not offer such education today. Eight states (Alabama, Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah) have laws in place that ban teaching LGBT sex education. Only 20% of LGBT students have heard anything positive about their community and they reported in a 2011 Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) report that they were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> positive information about LGBT people from a history or social studies class rather than a health class.|$|E
25|$|Achieving city {{status in}} 1484, Galway celebrated its quincentenary in 1984. Galway {{in itself is}} not {{particularly}} known for its attractions, but rather for its lively atmosphere and entertainment scene. This is partly because 25% {{of the population of}} Galway (75,529 in 2011) is made up of students primarily from NUI Galway and GMIT, two third level institutes in the city. Galway is particularly popular with American tourists as Galway {{is said to be the}} most 'Irish' of Ireland's cities, and is one of the few urban areas where you are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> Irish spoken, due to the fact the Gaeltacht area of Connemara is only a few kilometres away. The biggest lake in the country, Lough Corrib, is situated north of the city. The ferry to the Aran Islands is located about 40 minutes away and departs from the village of Rossaveal regularly. The Aran Islands are located in Galway Bay, and the Irish Language is by far the most used language on the islands, with the vast majority using the language regularly. As the islands are quite a bit from the mainland, cars are quite rare and the main form of transport is the bicycle.|$|E

40|$|People {{with light}} eyes {{are more prone}} to {{deafness}} after meningitis than those with dark eyes Bacterial meningitis is {{the most common cause of}} profound deafness acquired in childhood.

People with brown eyes are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> experience <b>hearing</b> loss after exposure to cisplatin. It is assumed that people with dark eyes also have more melanin in the inner ear than those with light eyes, and melanin causes the retention of ototoxic derivatives within the cochlea. 1 A higher melanin content in the cochlea also protects against the effects of noise; those with dark eyes are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> develop <b>hearing</b> loss associated with noise. <br/...|$|R

500|$|Ofcom {{estimates}} {{that even after}} extra spectrum has been allocated to DAB, around 90local radio stations {{will be unable to}} transmit on DAB, either because there is no space for them on a local DAB multiplex, or because they cannot afford the high transmission costs of DAB that the multiplex operators are charging. Ofcom announced in 2005 that it regarded Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) as an option for local stations unable to secure carriage or unable to pay the high transmission costs of DAB. The success of the small scale DAB multiplexes may alleviate this issue to some degree. One of the drawbacks of DAB and DAB+ has not been addressed. In simple terms the frequency of a broadcast is the carrier frequency (i.e. a sine wave). In order to carry any information the carrier frequency must be modulated. The signal at the receiver (radio) is then demodulated and the information is retrieved. The demodulators for FM signals are almost instantaneous so that one can have radios in different areas and move between those areas to hear the broadcast continuously. In contrast the demodulators for digital signals take a finite time and each digital radio takes a different time to demodulate the broadcast signal, so that if you move between different radios that are spatially apart you are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the same part of the broadcast twice or miss parts of it depending on the time to demodulate the signal of the individual radios. The other drawback with DAB is that it is all or nothing. If there is any interference or loss due to moving out of the footprint of the broadcast signal you will receive no signal, whereas in the case of FM you can hear something even if it is crackly.|$|E

2500|$|It is a {{well-established}} finding that, unlike written language, spoken language {{does not have}} any clear boundaries between words; spoken language is a continuous stream of sound rather than individual words with silences between them. This lack of segmentation between linguistic units presents a problem for young children learning language, who must be able to pick out individual units from the continuous speech streams that they hear. One proposed method of how children are able to solve this problem is that they are attentive to the statistical regularities of the world around them. For example, in the phrase [...] "pretty baby," [...] children are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the sounds pre and ty heard together during the entirety of the lexical input around them than they are to hear the sounds ty and ba together. In an artificial grammar learning study with adult participants, Saffran, Newport, and Aslin found that participants were able to locate word boundaries based only on transitional probabilities, suggesting that adults are capable of using statistical regularities in a language-learning task.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. A recent {{lawsuit filed}} against Apple Computers, Inc. has aroused public {{concern about the}} {{potential}} role of personal music players (MPs) {{in the development of}} hearing loss. In order to determine if such devices are used at levels <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> damage <b>hearing,</b> typical MP use levels were recorded from a sample of Northern Illinois University students. The average sound pressure level (Leq) was measured for each music sample. These levels were compared with National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommendations for maximum daily noise exposure. While previous research has indicatJ that MPs are capable of producing sound output levels that can damage hearing, from the data collected in the present study, it did not appear that the students were listening to their MPs at levels that were <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> cause noise-induced <b>hearing</b> loss. However, since the effects of noise exposure are cumulative it is possible that, when combined with exposure to other noise sources, the use of personal MPs could contribute <b>to</b> overall <b>hearing</b> loss.

Since it is likely that they were well informed about the risks of excessive noise exposure, it is possible that increased public awareness about such dangers will be of great benefit in preventing noise-induced hearing loss in the future.

Religion, as measured by individuals' religious affiliations, behaviors, and beliefs, has a lot of influence in structuring same-sex union attitudes and consistently influences opinions about homosexuality. The most liberal attitudes are generally reflected by Jews, liberal Protestants, and people who are not affiliated with religion. This is because many of their religious traditions have not [...] "systematically condemned homosexual behaviors" [...] in recent years. Moderate and tolerant attitudes are generally reflected by Catholics and moderate Protestants. And lastly, the most conservative views are held by Evangelical Protestants. Moreover, it is a tendency for one to be less tolerant of homosexuality if their social network is strongly tied to a religious congregation. Organized religion, especially Protestant and Baptist affiliations, espouse conservative views which traditionally denounce same-sex unions. Therefore, these congregations are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> messages of this nature.
