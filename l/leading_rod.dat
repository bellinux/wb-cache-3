40|$|Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) {{begins with}} the death of rod photoreceptors and is slowly {{followed}} by a gradual loss of cones and a rearrangement of the remaining retinal neurons. Clusterin is a chaperone protein that protects cells and is involved in various pathophysiological stresses, including retinal degeneration. Using a well-established transgenic rat model of RP (rhodopsin S 334 ter), we investigated the effects of clusterin on rod photoreceptor survival. To investigate the role of clusterin in S 334 ter-line 3 retinas, Voronoi analysis and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate the geometry of rod distribution. Additionally, immunoblot analysis, Bax activation, STAT 3 and Akt phosphorylation were used to evaluate the pathway involved in rod cell protection. In this study, clusterin (10 μg/ml) intravitreal treatment produced robust preservation of rod photoreceptors in S 334 ter-line 3 retina. The mean number of rods in 1 mm 2 was significantly greater in clusterin injected RP retinas (postnatal (P) 30, P 45, P 60, & P 75) than in age-matched saline injected RP retinas (P< 0. 01). Clusterin activated Akt, STAT 3 and significantly reduced Bax activity; in addition to inducing phosphorylated STAT 3 in Müller cells, which suggests it may indirectly acts on photoreceptors. Thus, clusterin treatment may interferes with mechanisms <b>leading</b> to <b>rod</b> death by suppressing cell death through activation of Akt and STAT 3, followed by Bax suppression.

40|$|The P 23 H {{mutation}} {{within the}} rhodopsin gene (RHO) causes rhodopsin misfolding, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), <b>leading</b> to <b>rod</b> photoreceptor degeneration and autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP). Grp 78 /BiP is an ER-localized chaperone that is induced by UPR signaling {{in response to}} ER stress. We have previously demonstrated that BiP mRNA levels are selectively reduced in animal models of ADRP arising from P 23 H rhodopsin expression at ages that precede photoreceptor degeneration. We have now overexpressed BiP {{to test the hypothesis}} that this chaperone promotes the trafficking of P 23 H rhodopsin to the cell membrane, reprograms the UPR favoring the survival of photoreceptors, blocks apoptosis, and, ultimately, preserves vision in ADRP rats. In cell culture, increasing levels of BiP had no impact on the localization of P 23 H rhodopsin. However, BiP overexpression alleviated ER stress by reducing levels of cleaved pATF 6 protein, phosphorylated eIF 2 α and the proapoptotic protein CHOP. In P 23 H rats, photoreceptor levels of cleaved ATF 6, pEIF 2 α, CHOP, and caspase- 7 were much higher than those of wild-type rats. Subretinal delivery of AAV 5 expressing BiP to transgenic rats led to reduction in CHOP and photoreceptor apoptosis and to a sustained increase in electroretinogram amplitudes. We detected complexes between BiP, caspase- 12, and the BH 3 -only protein BiK that may contribute to the antiapoptotic activity of BiP. Thus, the preservation of photoreceptor function resulting from elevated levels of BiP is due to suppression of apoptosis rather than to a promotion of rhodopsin folding...|$|R

However, most studies do not report radiometric measurements, which makes it impossible to categorize the stimulation according to photopic, mesopic, and scotopic vision.

The frequencies were multiples of the individual alpha frequency (α) of each volunteer in the range from 0. 40 – 2. 30 *α. 306 -channel whole head magnetoencephalography recordings were analyzed in time, frequency, and spatiotemporal domains with the Topographic Matching Pursuit algorithm. We found resonance phenomena and frequency entrainment for stimulations at or close to the individual alpha frequency (0. 90 – 1. 10 *α) and half of the alpha frequency (0. 40 – 0. 55 *α).

Fe-based bulk {{metallic}} glasses with good soft magnetic softness, high strength and relatively low material cost should have greatest potential for {{wide variety of}} applications among many kinds of bulk {{metallic glasses}} (BMGs).

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a new method to arrange dye {{molecules}} (porphyrins and perylenes) in a well-organised fashion over extended lengths up {{to hundreds of}} nanometers is presented. This method {{was inspired by the}} naturally occurring light harvesting systems that are capable of efficient energy transfer over large distances (> 100 Å), involving tens or hundreds of bacteriochlorophyll pigments. It was envisioned that the arrangement of the dye molecules in a well-defined organisation would require a rigid polymeric scaffold. Polyisocyanides are helical, intrinsically rigid polymers that could serve this purpose. It was recently discovered by our group that polyisocyanides prepared from isocyanodipeptides form stable -helical architectures due to the presence of hydrogen bonding arrays along the helical polymer backbone. This hydrogen bonding network rigidifies the helix and prevents unwinding to a random-coil structure. Besides, the handedness of the polymeric backbone can be tuned by using the appropriate L- or D-amino acids. Using this strategy {{we have been able to}} construct a new series of polyisocyanides covered with porphyrins and perylenes, <b>leading</b> to rigid <b>rod</b> polymers with unique optical properties. The polymers have lengths up to several hundred nanometers containing thousands of chromophores in a precisely defined organisation and are capable of excitation energy transfer over several nanometers. These polymers are potentially interesting for application in plastic solar cells...|$|R
5000|$|Smaller ellipses create fewer reflections, (a {{condition}} called [...] "close-coupling"), giving higher intensity {{in the center}} of the rod. For a single flashlamp, if the lamp and rod are equal diameter, an ellipse that is twice as wide as it is high is usually the most efficient at imaging the light into the rod. The rod and the lamp are relatively long to minimize the effect of losses at the end faces and to provide a sufficient length of gain medium. Longer flashlamps are also more efficient at transferring electrical energy into light, due to higher impedance. However, if the rod is too long in relation to its diameter a {{condition called}} [...] "prelasing" [...] can occur, depleting the rod's energy before it can properly build up. Rod ends are often antireflection coated or cut at Brewster's angle to minimize this effect. Flat mirrors are also often used at the ends of the pump cavity to reduce loss. Variations on this design use more complex mirrors composed of overlapping elliptical shapes, to allow multiple flashlamps to pump a single rod. This allows greater power, but are less efficient because not all of the light is correctly imaged into the <b>rod,</b> <b>leading</b> to increased thermal losses. These losses can be minimized by using a close-coupled cavity. This approach may allow more symmetric pumping, increasing beam quality, however.|$|R
