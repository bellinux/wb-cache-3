5|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II the paintings were evacuated to various locations in Wales, including Penrhyn Castle and the university colleges of Bangor and Aberystwyth. In 1940, as the Battle of France raged, a more secure home was sought, and there were discussions about moving the paintings to Canada. This idea was firmly rejected by Winston Churchill, who wrote in a telegram to the director Kenneth Clark, “bury them in caves or in cellars, but not a picture shall <b>leave</b> <b>these</b> islands”. Instead a slate quarry at Manod, near Blaenau Ffestiniog in North Wales, was requisitioned for the Gallery's use. In the seclusion afforded by the paintings' new location, the Keeper (and future director) Martin Davies began to compile scholarly catalogues on the collection, helped {{by the fact that}} the Gallery's library was also stored in the quarry. The move to Manod confirmed the importance of storing paintings at a constant temperature and humidity, something the Gallery's conservators had long suspected but had hitherto been unable to prove. This eventually resulted in the first air-conditioned gallery opening in 1949.|$|E

The ship was laid down on 12 February 1936 and {{launched}} on 11 February 1937 {{as the second}} Royal Navy warship to carry the name. Ivanhoe was completed on 24 August 1937 and cost £259,371 excluding items supplied by Admiralty such as guns and communications equipment. She {{was assigned to the}} 3rd Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning and participated in training exercises with the French Navy in December through January 1938. The ship was forced to <b>leave</b> <b>these</b> exercises prematurely as she had problems with the tubes in her superheaters. These were replaced at Malta from 15 January–19 March. Afterwards, Ivanhoe was transferred to Gibraltar where she patrolled Spanish waters enforcing the policies of the Non-Intervention Committee {{until the end of the}} war. She was in Cartagena in February–March 1939 to protect British citizens and interests as foreigners, Republican troops and their supporters evacuated the city.|$|E

5|$|The {{withdrawal}} {{was scheduled}} to begin shortly following the misdirected airstrike, and was to be preceded by an artillery bombardment with high explosive and smoke at 16:00. The American tanks were subsequently moved forward to provide cover, and when the New Zealand artillery failed to fire at the appointed hour, they provided the direct fire support. Still in contact, the Australians began to pull back, fighting a number of well-disciplined rearguard actions as the companies leapfrogged each other. Meanwhile, the New Zealand artillery kept the Chinese at bay, after it finally commenced firing. B Company had taken 39 Chinese prisoners during the earlier fighting, and unable to <b>leave</b> <b>these</b> behind, {{they were used to}} carry many of the Australian wounded and much of their equipment as well. O'Dowd's fear that the Chinese might have blocked the withdrawal route was not realised, and B Company moved back along the ridge and down to the ford without incident, reaching the Middlesex area after dark. C Company was the next to withdraw, departing at 16:30, just after suffering another casualty from sniper fire. Saunders led his company up the spur and then south down the main ridge without incident, followed by A Company during the next hour with the Chinese in close pursuit.|$|E

25|$|The Arras {{agreement}} required all Spanish {{troops to}} <b>leave</b> <b>these</b> lands. Meanwhile, Philip had {{his eye on}} uniting the entire Iberian peninsula under his rule, a traditional objective of Spanish monarchs. The opportunity came in 1578 when the Portuguese king Sebastian launched a crusade against Morocco. The expedition ended in disaster and Sebastian's disappearance at the Battle of the Three Kings. His aged uncle Henry ruled until he died in 1580. Although Philip had long prepared for the takeover of Portugal, he still {{found it necessary to}} launch a military occupation led by the Duke of Alva. Philip took the title of King of Portugal, but otherwise the country remained autonomous, retaining its own laws, currency, and institutions. However, Portugal surrendered all independence in foreign policy, and {{relations between the two countries}} were never warm.|$|E

Before midnight, the Chechen command left the Palace in three groups, Maskhadov being among the last to <b>leave.</b> <b>These</b> groups retreated to a hospital {{on the south side of}} the Sunzha River, while Russian helicopters flew over the city calling on Chechens to surrender with no effect. According to elements of the Chechen command, Russian snipers had Chechens in full sight but were too exhausted to continue fighting.|$|E
25|$|Brown recluse spiders build {{asymmetrical}} (irregular) webs {{that frequently}} include a shelter consisting of disorderly thread. They frequently build their webs in woodpiles and sheds, closets, garages, plenum spaces, cellars, {{and other places}} that are dry and generally undisturbed. When dwelling in human residences they seem to favor cardboard, possibly because it mimics the rotting tree bark which they inhabit naturally. They have also been encountered in shoes, inside dressers, in bed sheets of infrequently used beds, in clothes stacked or piled or left lying on the floor, inside work gloves, behind baseboards and pictures, in toilets, and near sources of warmth when ambient temperatures are lower than usual. Human-recluse contact often occurs when such isolated spaces are disturbed and the spider feels threatened. Unlike most web weavers, they <b>leave</b> <b>these</b> lairs at night to hunt. Males move around more when hunting than the females, which tend to remain nearer to their webs. The spider will hunt for firebrats, crickets, cockroaches, and other soft-bodied insects.|$|E

25|$|Because of this view, the NAC board {{decided to}} hire a {{professional}} trainer. Englishman Ben Affleck {{was hired as a}} coach and was a couple of months later succeeded by James Moore. When Moore resigned, the NAC board issued a committee, who would select the best 11 NAC players to play a match. In 1931 Antoon Verlegh retired from football. Verlegh, nowadays a club icon for NAC, played for NAC since its foundation. In this year, NAC also had a dispute with the City of Breda. The stadium’s terrain ‘t Ploegske was zoned as a residential area and NAC had to <b>leave</b> <b>these</b> grounds. Because no other option was available in Breda, NAC were forced to move to the town Princenhage. Within two months a complete new stadium, with a capacity of 5,500 people, was built and NAC left Breda. In 1935 NAC was also the first club in the Netherlands to travel by airplane to an away match against GVAV.|$|E
25|$|According to Pew Forum {{estimate}} in 2016 {{there are}} 3.3 million Muslims, comprising about 1% {{of the total}} U.S. population. A Pew Forum report on American religion found that Muslims accounted for 0.9% of American adults in 2014, up from 0.4% in 2007, due largely to immigration. Retention rates were high, at 77%, similar to Hindus (80%) and Jews (75%); most people who <b>leave</b> <b>these</b> religions become unaffiliated, although ex-Muslims {{were more likely to}} be Christians than ex-Hindus or ex-Jews were. Conversely, 23% of American Muslims were converts, including 8% from historically black Protestant traditions, 6% from being unaffiliated, 4% from Catholicism, and 3% from mainline or evangelical Protestantism. By race, in 2014, 38% were non-Hispanic white (including Arabs and Iranians, up from 32% in 2007), 28% were Asian (mostly Indians, Pakistanis, and Bangladeshis, up from 20% in 2007), 28% were black (down from 32%), 4% Hispanic (down from 7%), and 3% of mixed or other race (down from 7%). Since 2007, the black proportion had shrunk, while the white and Asian proportions had grown, mainly due to immigration as most black Muslims were native U.S. blacks.|$|E
25|$|Russell had {{obtained}} a loan from Aaron the Jew of Lincoln (died 1186), {{the greatest of}} the Jewish financiers licensed to trade in England, and on the seizure of Jewish assets by King Henry II (1154–1189) in 1186 his debt became due to the crown. It appears the Treasury was content {{for a while to}} <b>leave</b> <b>these</b> debts uncollected, but the position changed following King John's peace treaty with King Philip II of France (1180–1223) signed in May 1200, which required the English king to pay Philip the sum of 20,000 marks. Thereupon John levied a carucage tax on the kingdom and adopted a more active policy towards collection of Aaron's debts, then dealt with on account of their magnitude by a separate specially formed Exchequer of the Jews. In 1200 John Russell rendered his account for his debt to Aaron of £12 14s 8d and paid into the Exchequer on account the sum of 20s (i.e., £1). For the balance he was given respite by royal writ until 1207/8 when he rendered his account for £5 12s 8d and paid 6 marks into the Treasury. He obtained the king's writ for quittance of the remainder.|$|E

25|$|On 11 October 1899, war was {{declared}} with a Boer offensive into the British-held Natal and Cape Colony areas, Boer republics, beginning the Second Boer War. In {{the early stages}} of the conflict, Smuts served as Paul Kruger's eyes and ears, handling propaganda, logistics, communication with generals and diplomats, and anything else that was required. In the second phase of the war, Smuts served under Koos de la Rey, who commanded 500 commandos in the Western Transvaal. Smuts excelled at hit-and-run warfare, and the unit evaded and harassed a British army forty times its size. President Kruger and the deputation in Europe thought that there was good hope for their cause in the Cape Colony. They decided to send General de la Rey there to assume supreme command, but then decided to act more cautiously when they realised that General de la Rey could hardly be spared in the Western Transvaal. Consequently, Smuts was left with a small force of 300 men, while another 100 men followed him. By this point in the war, the British scorched earth policy left little grazing land. One hundred of the cavalry that had joined Smuts were therefore too weak to continue and so Smuts had to <b>leave</b> <b>these</b> men with General Kritzinger. Intelligence indicated that at this time Smuts had about 3,000 men.|$|E
