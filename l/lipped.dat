It features a wider than normal bit, whose outside edges are sharply turned up, so that when gazing directly down the adze, from bit to eye, the cutting edge resembles an extremely wide and often very flat U. This adze was mainly used for shaping cross grain, such as for joining planks.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the early}} 1960s, mussels were {{harvested}} by hand from intertidal rocks. Dredging was then introduced, {{and within a}} few years the mussel beds in Tasman Bay and the Hauraki Gulf were dredged clean. In the late 1960s, following this collapse, the aquaculture of the New Zealand mussel began. The endemic green <b>lipped</b> mussel was used to trial growing mussel spat (young mussels) on ropes suspended from rafts. The Hauraki Gulf and the Marlborough Sounds provided sheltered environments, with clean water rich in plankton. The cultured mussels were ready for harvest after 12 to 18 months, and first went on sale in 1971.|$|E

On the modern, steel adze the cutting edge may be flat for smoothing work to very rounded for hollowing work such as bowls, gutters and canoes. The shoulders or sides of an adze may be curved called a <b>lipped</b> adze, used for notching. The end away from the cutting edge is called the pole and be of different shapes, generally flat or a pin pole.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} round of the Waste Management Phoenix Open, Mickelson tied his career low round of 60. He made seven birdies in his first nine holes and needed a birdie on the 18th hole to equal the PGA Tour record of 59. However, his 25-foot birdie putt on the final hole <b>lipped</b> out, {{resulting}} in him missing out by a single shot on making only the sixth round of 59 in PGA Tour history. Mickelson led the tournament wire-to-wire and completed a four shot win over Brandt Snedeker for his 41st PGA Tour victory and 3rd Phoenix Open title. Mickelson's score of 28-under-par tied Mark Calcavecchia's tournament scoring record. He also moved back inside the world's top 10 after falling down as far as number 22.|$|E
500|$|Apart from {{anthropomorphic}} {{images of}} Shiva, {{he is also}} represented in aniconic form of a lingam. These are depicted in various designs. One common form is {{the shape of a}} vertical rounded column in the centre of a <b>lipped,</b> disk-shaped object, the yoni, symbolism for the goddess Shakti. In Shiva temples, the linga is typically present in its sanctum sanctorum and is the focus of votary offerings such as milk, water, flower petals, fruit, fresh leaves, and rice. According to Monier Williams and Yudit Greenberg, linga literally means [...] "mark, sign or emblem", and also refers to a [...] "mark or sign from which the existence of something else can be reliably inferred". It implies the regenerative divine energy innate in nature, symbolized by Shiva. Some scholars, such as Wendy Doniger, view linga merely as an erotic phallic symbol, although this interpretation is disputed by others, including Swami Vivekananda, Sivananda Saraswati, and S. N. Balagangadhara. According to Moriz Winternitz, the linga in the Shiva tradition is [...] "only a symbol of the productive and creative principle of nature as embodied in Shiva", and it has no historical trace in any obscene phallic cult.|$|E
500|$|Beckinsale rose to fame in 2001 with {{a leading}} role in the war film Pearl Harbor as a nurse torn between two pilots, played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett. She was drawn to the project by the script: [...] "It's so unusual these days to read a script that has those old-fashioned values to it. Not morals, but movie values. It's a big, {{sweeping}} epic....You just never get the chance to do that." [...] Director Michael Bay initially had doubts about casting the actress: [...] "I wasn't sure about her at first...she wore black leather trousers in her screen test and I thought she was a little nasty...it was easy to think of this woman as a slut." [...] He eventually decided to hire her because she wasn't [...] "too beautiful. Women feel disturbed when they see someone’s too pretty." [...] He asked her to lose weight during filming. In a 2004 interview, the actress noted that his comments were [...] "upsetting" [...] and said she wore leather trousers because [...] "it was snowing out. It wasn't exactly like I had my nipple rings in." [...] She felt grateful that she had not had to deal with such criticism at a younger age: [...] "If I had come on to a movie set at [...] age and someone had said, 'You're a bit funny-looking, can you go on a diet?'—I might have jumped off a building. I just didn't have the confidence to put that into perspective at the time." [...] However, speaking in 2011, she said she was [...] "very fond" [...] of Bay. Pearl Harbor received negative reviews. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised [...] "the avid eyed, ruby <b>lipped</b> Kate Beckinsale, the rare actress whose intelligence gives her a sensual bloom; she's like Parker Posey without irony." [...] A.O.Scott of The New York Times noted that [...] "Mr.Affleck and Ms.Beckinsale do what they can with their lines, and glow with the satiny shine of real movie stars." [...] However, Mike Clark of USA Today felt that the [...] "usually appealing Kate Beckinsale" [...] is [...] "inexplicably submerged—like her hospital colleagues—under heaps of tarty makeup that even actresses of the era didn't wear." [...] The film was a commercial success, grossing $449 million worldwide.|$|E

40|$|Synthesis of {{multiple}} extracellular lipases in Candida rugosa has been demonstrated. However, {{it is difficult}} to characterize the expression spectrum of <b>lip</b> genes, since the sequences of the <b>lip</b> multigene family are very closely related. A competitive reverse transcription-PCR assay was developed to quantify the expression of <b>lip</b> genes. In agreement with the protein profile, the abundance of <b>lip</b> mRNAs was found to be (in decreasing order) <b>lip</b> 1, <b>lip</b> 3, <b>lip</b> 2, <b>lip</b> 5, and <b>lip</b> 4. To analyze the effects of different culture conditions, the transcript concentrations for these mRNA species were normalized relative to the values for gpd, encoding glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase. In relative terms, <b>lip</b> 1 and <b>lip</b> 3 were highly and constitutively expressed (about 105 molecules per μg of total RNA) whereas the other inducible <b>lip</b> genes, especially <b>lip</b> 4, showed significant changes in mRNA expression under different culture conditions.

50|$|The <b>lips</b> {{are filled}} in {{using a small}} brush. The colour comes in a small stick, which is melted in water. Crystallized sugar is then added to give the <b>lips</b> luster.

This technique not only reduces {{the volume of the}} <b>lips,</b> but also restores an attractive labial contour, as well as an ideal volume relationship between the upper and lower <b>lips.</b> Because it is based on aesthetic analysis, this technique consistently yields both smaller and more aesthetically appealing <b>lips.</b> Simply stated, the bikini <b>lip</b> reduction consists of excision of a ‘bikini top’ (two cups and a middle strap) from the upper <b>lip</b> and a ‘bikini bottom’ (a triangle) from the lower <b>lip.</b> The aesthetic results and the patient satisfaction achieved through the bikini <b>lip</b> reduction technique have been very satisfactory...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} activation of two isoenzymes (<b>lip</b> 1 and <b>lip</b> 3) from Candida rugosa in polyethylene glycol (PEG) media. Aqueous solutions of PEG 8000 and 20, 000 activate <b>lip</b> 3 but not <b>lip</b> 1 from C. rugosa. Maximum activation (260 %) of <b>lip</b> 3 requires 6 h of pre-incubation with PEG 8000 (4 %, w/v).

Inhibition experiments demonstrate that ligands have easier access to the <b>lip</b> 3 active site than to the <b>lip</b> 1 active site, both in the presence {{and the absence of}} PEG. The presence of PEG in the crystallization medium is responsible for reported differences in the crystal structures of <b>lip</b> 1 and <b>lip</b> 3.

2500|$|American Northwest coast {{native peoples}} {{traditionally}} used adzes for both functional construction (from bowls to canoes) and art (from masks to totem poles).

[...] The thin end is used as the handle and the thick end is flattened and notched such that an adze iron can be lashed to it. Modern hafts are sometimes constructed from a sawed blank with a dowel added for strength at the crook. [...] The second form is the D-handle adze which is basically an adze iron with a directly attached handle. [...] The D-handle therefore provides no mechanical leverage.
