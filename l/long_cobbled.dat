Crosswinds, the difficulty of <b>long</b> <b>cobbled</b> sections or crashes are often the major challenges of these stages. On hilly and particularly mountain stages, there can be major shifts in the general classification, particularly where stages finish at the tops of climbs.

6000|$|He {{still had}} no desire for sleep, but he began slowly to undress. His clothes, his tie, {{everything}} he had been wearing, seemed to him to reek of accumulated perfumes of the night, and he flung them from him with feverish disgust. There was a small bath-room opening from his sleeping chamber, and with a desire for complete cleanliness which was not wholly physical, he filled the bath and plunged in. The touch of the cold water was inspiring and he stepped out again into a new world. Much of the horror of so short a time ago had gone, but with his new self had come an ever-increasing distaste for any resumption, in any shape or form, of his associations {{of the last few}} days. He must get away. He rummaged through his things and found a timetable. In less than an hour he was dressed, his clothes were packed, and the bill was paid. He wrote a short note to Davenant and a shorter one to Ella. Ignoring {{the events of the last}} night, he spoke of a summons home. He enclosed the receipted hotel bill, and something with which he begged her to purchase a souvenir of her visit. Then he drank some coffee, and with a somewhat stealthy air made his way to the lift, and thence to the courtyard of the hotel. Already a small victoria was laden with his luggage; the concierge, the baggage-master, the porters, were all tipped with a prodigality almost reckless. Shaven, and with a sting of the cold water still upon his skin, in homely flannel shirt and grey tweed travelling clothes, he felt like a man restored to sanity and health as his cab lumbered over the <b>long</b> <b>cobbled</b> street, on its way to the Gare du Nord. It was only a matter of a few hours, and yet how sweet and fresh the streets seemed in the early morning sunshine. The shops were all open, and the busy housewives were hard at work with their bargaining, the toilers of the city thronged the pavements, everywhere there was evidence of a real and rational life. The city of those few hours ago was surely a city of nightmares. The impassable river flowed between. Macheson leaned back in his carriage and his eyes were fixed upon the blue sunlit sky. His lips moved; a song of gratitude was in his heart. He felt like the prisoner before whom the iron gates have been rolled back, disclosing the smiling world! ...|$|E

50|$|Brown Bluff has a 1.5 km <b>long</b> <b>cobble</b> and ash beach rising {{increasingly}} steeply towards towering red-brown tuff cliffs {{which are}} embedded with volcanic bombs and tephra. The cliffs are heavily eroded, resulting in loose scree and rock falls on higher slopes, and large, wind eroded boulders on the beach. Permanent ice and tidewater glaciers surround {{the site to}} the north and south, occasionally filling the beach with brash ice.|$|R
50|$|In 2017 {{the race}} {{featured}} 12 climbs, including the Muur van Geraardsbergen, and five <b>long</b> flat <b>cobbled</b> sectors. The final 31 km, including Kruisberg, Oude Kwaremont and Paterberg, are {{identical to the}} men's finale.|$|R
50|$|Ponto-chō centres {{around one}} <b>long,</b> narrow, <b>cobbled</b> alley running from Shijō-dōri to Sanjō-dōri, one block {{west of the}} Kamo River (Kamo-gawa). This is also the {{traditional}} location of the start of kabuki, and a statue of Okuni still stands {{on the opposite side}} of the river.

50|$|The station lies to {{the east}} of the town centre, across Otley Road, There is no access {{directly}} from Otley Road: pedestrian access from town is either via a tunnel at the bottom of Station Road, or from Stead Street onto platform 1. Vehicular access is from the side away from town, under the bridge and up a <b>long</b> <b>cobbled</b> drive from Briggate and there is a large car-park between the main station and platforms 1/2.|$|E
50|$|The Trouée d'Arenberg or Tranchée de Wallers-Arenberg (English: Trench of Arenberg) is a 2.4 km <b>long</b> <b>cobbled</b> {{road in the}} {{municipality}} of Wallers in Northern France, in the Département Nord. The road's official name is La Drève des Boules d'Hérin ("Bullet Alley of Hérin") and crosses the Forêt de Raismes-Saint-Amand-Wallers, outside France {{better known as the}} Forest of Arenberg. It is best known from the annual cycling classic Paris-Roubaix held in April, where {{it is one of the}} most difficult passages of the race.|$|E
5000|$|The {{terminal}} {{is part of}} Liberty State Park, {{and along}} with nearby Ellis Island and Statue of Liberty recalls the era of massive immigration through the Port of New York and New Jersey. It is estimated that around 10.5 million entered the country through the station. The area {{has long been known}} as Communipaw, which in the Algonquian language Lenape means big landing place at the side of a river [...] The first stop west of the station was indeed called Communipaw, and was not far from the village that had been established there in 1634 as part of the New Netherland settlement of Pavonia. The land on which the extensive yards were built was reclaimed, or filled. The terminal itself is next to the Morris Canal Big Basin, which to some degree was made obsolete by the railroads which replaced it. The <b>long</b> <b>cobbled</b> road which ends at the terminal (once called Johnston Avenue for a president of CNJ) is Audrey Zapp Drive, for the environmentalist active {{in the creation of the}} park.|$|E
50|$|From 2004 to 2011 {{the race}} ran over a 115 km course which {{followed}} the last 55 km of the men's race {{to finish in}} Meerbeke. Russian Zoulfia Zabirova won the inaugural edition. The 2011 edition featured three <b>long</b> flat <b>cobbled</b> sections - Paddestraat (2400m), Mater-Kerkgate (3000m) and Haaghoek (2000m) - and 10 hills, including the Molenberg, Eikenmolen, Muur-Kapelmuur and Bosberg.|$|R
25|$|From 2004 to 2011 {{the race}} ran over a 115km course {{following}} the last 55km of the men's race {{to finish in}} Meerbeke. Since 2012 the race starts and finishes in Oudenaarde. It is 153km and has a similar finale as the men's Tour of Flanders, {{with many of the}} same hills, except for the Koppenberg. In 2017 the race features 12 climbs, including the Muur van Geraardsbergen, and three <b>long</b> flat <b>cobbled</b> sectors. The final 35km, including Kruisberg, Oude Kwaremont and Paterberg, are identical to the men's finale.|$|R
50|$|Neptune's fields (Swedish: Neptuni åkrar) is {{a nature}} reserve {{in the north}} of the island of Öland, Sweden. Located in Borgholm Municipality along the Kalmar Strait, north of the village of Byxelkrok, it {{consists}} of a <b>long</b> stretch of <b>cobble</b> beach covered with Echium vulgare which blossoms in June and July, coloring the entire area blue. The cobble stones result from stones left during the last ice age that eroded through the action of the waves, and they are interspersed with fossils from Trilobites and Brachiopods.|$|R
5000|$|The women's {{parcours}} was 119.4 km, {{with seven}} climbs, including the Kluisberg, Côte de Trieu, Paterberg, Edelareberg, Wolvenberg and Molenberg. When the race hit the Paterberg, Elisa Longo Borghini of Hitec-Mistral {{was the first}} to top the climb, leading a group of ten or so riders, with a strong group of 12, including Loes Gunnewijk, chasing at 90 seconds behind them. From here onwards, the front of the race was full of attacks, escapes and regroupings. Noemi Cantele, racing for her brand-new team, was especially aggressive, but couldn't make it away from the front group of 12 which had formed at the half-way point of the Côte de Trieu - Cantele; Gunnewijk, Tiffany Cromwell and Amanda Spratt of GreenEdge-AIS; Longo Borghini and Lise Nøstvold of Hitec-Mistral; Ellen van Dijk and Trixi Worrack of Martine Bras (Dolmans-Boels); Pauline Ferrand-Prévot (Rabobank); and Lizzie Armitstead (AA Drink-Leontien.nl). Behind them on the road, the race was all small groups, and the group had its share of drama, with Armitstead crashing, and having to chase back with Van Dijk, as well as the usual women's-style attacking at every possible opportunity. The attacks continued, but none could stick, until at about 20-30 km to go, Gunnewijk attacked on the <b>long</b> <b>cobbled</b> stretch of the Paddestraat. Once the cobbles were over, Van Dijk was able the only one able to bridge across to her, and the two Dutchwomen worked together, to make this attack permanent, with their team-mates behind them to disrupt the chase. At 12 km to go, the pair had 1' 36" [...] on the group, and the race was set up for an exciting duel - Van Dijk the better sprinter, but Gunnewijk a rouleur with some of the best tactical skills out there, looking for her opportunity to escape. In the end, it was Gunnewijk's attack that won the day, and Van Dijk's team-mate Trixi Worrack completing the podium, winning the sprint for third from the chase group home (and another teammate, Chloe Hosking, sprinting to lead the next group home). It was a tough race, with only 36 out of the 97 riders who finished making it in within the 5% timecut.|$|E
50|$|Construction {{began in}} 1957. Park Hill (Part One) was officially opened by Hugh Gaitskell, MP and Leader of the Opposition, on 16 June 1961. The City Council {{published}} a brochure on the scheme {{which was in}} several languages, including Russian.To maintain {{a strong sense of}} community, neighbours were re-homed next door to each other and old street names from the area were re-used (e.g. Gilbert Row, <b>Long</b> Henry Row). <b>Cobbles</b> from the terraced streets surrounded the flats and paved the pathways down the hill to Sheffield station and tramlines.|$|R
50|$|Exploration of {{the northeastern}} {{portion of the}} fort {{revealed}} evidence of a large timber building. This evidence was the trench left by {{the remains of a}} wall running along the northwest-southeast axis. There were also two metal-clad post holes. Another building aligned in the same direction was beside the via decumana, evidenced by two wall trenches 7.8m apart and 6.8m <b>long.</b> A <b>cobbled</b> yard lay just to the east of this building. A clay oven was found in 1984 inside this building; however, this clay oven may not be contemporary with the building, and its location might just be a coincidence. This oven was sealed with clay after a fire was built during the Flavian dynasty. Further wall trenches were dug through the remains of this building, and they indicate the presence of a later building 8.5m long and 6.75m wide with a passageway on the eastern side. Two drains aligned on the northwest-southeast axis cut through this building. The occupation of this site occurred during 70 to 120 AD, with a period of abandonment around 100 AD.|$|R
25|$|Since the race's {{restyling}} in 2012, the climbs of Oude Kwaremont, Paterberg and Koppenberg, {{just south}} of Oudenaarde, are {{the heart of the}} action. The Kwaremont is a <b>long</b> section of <b>cobbles</b> that starts sharply before gradually levelling out. It is the site where powerful riders often make the race-winning move, as Fabian Cancellara demonstrated in 2013, when he attacked with Peter Sagan on the lower slopes of Kwaremont before distancing the Slovak on the Paterberg. The Paterberg is the final climb of the day where fans create a carnival-like atmosphere. It is a short but cobbled climb and viciously steep. After 245km of racing, it is generally an ultimate test of endurance and strength.|$|R
