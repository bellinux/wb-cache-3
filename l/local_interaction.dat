We have used a new high-throughput analysis tool to probe this underexplored area through full pair-wise genome scans and conventional GWAS in diastolic and systolic blood pressure and six metabolic traits in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC 1966) and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study cohort (ARIC). Genome-wide significant interactions were detected in ARIC for systolic blood pressure between PLEKHA 7 (a known GWAS locus for blood pressure) and GPR 180 (which plays a role in vascular remodelling), and also for triglycerides as <b>local</b> <b>interactions</b> within the 11 q 23. 3 region (replicated significantly in NFBC 1966), which notably harbours several loci (BUD 13, ZNF 259 and APOA 5) contributing to triglyceride levels. Tests of the <b>local</b> <b>interactions</b> within the 11 q 23. 3 region conditional on the top GWAS signal suggested the presence of two independent functional variants, each with supportive evidence for their roles in gene regulation. <b>Local</b> <b>interactions</b> captured 9 additional GWAS loci identified in this study (3 significantly replicated) and 73 from previous GWAS (24 in the eight traits and 49 in related traits). We conclude that the detection of <b>local</b> <b>interactions</b> requires adequate SNP coverage of the genome and that such interactions are only likely to be detectable between SNPs in low linkage disequilibrium.

50|$|In general, social {{networks}} are self-organizing, emergent, and complex, such that a globally coherent pattern appears from the <b>local</b> <b>interaction</b> {{of the elements}} {{that make up the}} system. These patterns become more apparent as network size increases. However, a global network analysis of, for example, all interpersonal relationships in the world is not feasible and is likely to contain so much information as to be uninformative. Practical limitations of computing power, ethics and participant recruitment and payment also limit the scope of a social network analysis. The nuances of a local system may be lost in a large network analysis, hence the quality of information may be more important than its scale for understanding network properties. Thus, {{social networks}} are analyzed at the scale relevant to the researcher's theoretical question. Although levels of analysis are not necessarily mutually exclusive, there are three general levels into which networks may fall: micro-level, , and macro-level.|$|E

5000|$|Vollhardt {{is one of}} {{the founders}} of the Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) for {{strongly}} correlated electronic solids such as transition metals (e.g. iron or vanadium) and their oxides, i.e. materials with electrons in open d- and f-shells. The properties of these systems are determined by the Coulomb repulsion between the electrons which makes these electrons strongly correlated. The repulsion has the tendency to localize electrons. This leads to a multitude of phenomena such as the Mott-Hubbard metal insulator transition. Conventional band theory or density functional theory cannot describe these systems adequately. In 1989 Vollhardt and his doctoral student Walter Metzner introduced electronic models with <b>local</b> <b>interaction</b> (Hubbard model) on a lattice with infinitely many nearest neighbors, which Gabriel Kotliar and Antoine Georges then developed into the DMFT. The DMFT may be viewed as a self-consistent, field-theoretical generalization of a quantum impurity model by Philip W.

5000|$|But now, the {{interaction}} energy {{is supposed to}} be at a minimum when atoms sit on the vertices of a regular pentagon. Trying to propagate in the long range a packing of these pentagons sharing edges (atomic bonds) and vertices (atoms) is impossible. This is due to the impossibility of tiling a plane with regular pentagons, simply because the pentagon vertex angle does not divide 2. Three such pentagons can easily fit at a common vertex, but a gap remains between two edges. It is this kind of discrepancy which is called [...] "geometric frustration". There is one way to overcome this difficulty. Let the surface to be tiled be free of any presupposed topology, and let us build the tiling with a strict application of the <b>local</b> <b>interaction</b> rule. In this simple example, we observe that the surface inherits the topology of a sphere and so receives a curvature. The final structure, here a pentagonal dodecahedron, allows for a perfect propagation of the pentagonal order. It is called an [...] "ideal" [...] (defect-free) model for the considered structure.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1800s, {{newspapers}} were largely for the elite and took two forms - mercantile sheets that were {{intended for the}} business community and contained ship schedules, wholesale product prices, advertisements and some stale foreign news, and political newspapers that were controlled by political parties or their editors as a means of sharing their views with elite stakeholders. Journalists reported the party line and editorialized in favor of party positions. The emergence of the penny press greatly influenced communication technologies by covering news outside those of government interests. The first penny paper, the Sun, was founded in New York in September 1833. After that time, newspapers became nonpartisan since they were not supported by political parties. Penny papers hired reporters and correspondents to seek out and write the news, while at the same time, started to sound more journalistic than editorial. Reporters were assigned to beats and were involved in the conduct of <b>local</b> <b>interaction.</b> The penny press contributed to changes in newspaper content and structure. New journalism practices resulted in the development of concepts such as news reporting, emphasizing the importance of timeliness, and appealing to wider audiences. These newspapers, though not completely uninfluenced by political parties and their views, were self-funded and not party-funded. This allowed them to shift allegiance on political issues that the papers dealt with quite easily, which also aided in their success and acceptance by the general public.|$|E

40|$|Organisms {{ranging from}} {{bacteria}} and corals to plants and vertebrates can form intransitive competitive networks, in which coexistence {{can be maintained}} because no one species or genotype is superior to all others. However, in the simplest case with three competing types, the long-term outcome {{may not be so}} clear if two of the three represent the ends of a continuous heritable trait distribution within one species, as has been recently demonstrated empirically in a short-term experiment with plants. Using simulation models of this scenario, results with asexual reproduction confirm previous studies which showed that <b>local</b> <b>interactions</b> promote coexistence. However, with sexual reproduction, genetic variance is reduced because selection fluctuates between favouring the two extremes during population cycles, while sex continually produces intermediates. Sex thus slows the response to selection when it is the strongest and therefore slows the recovery from extreme abundances, creating larger abundance fluctuations. <b>Local</b> <b>interactions</b> do not stabilize dynamics with sex because the resultant spatial patches of one species are genetically heterogeneous, such that particular phenotypes do not benefit from spatial refuges.
