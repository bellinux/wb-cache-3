5|$|Dean Lyons {{was born}} on 20 April 1973; he was 24 when he was arrested. He grew up in Tallaght in West Dublin, the fourth {{in a family of}} six children. He went to Scoil Aonghusa National School in Tallaght, where he had some {{difficulty}} with his schoolwork. According to his teachers, in today's terms, he would have been classified as having a moderate general <b>learning</b> <b>disability.</b> He was assessed by a psychologist when he was in sixth class, around the age of twelve, who found him to have an intelligence quotient of 70. As a result of the psychologist's report, Lyons was moved to St. Joseph's Special School in Tallaght. During his period in St. Joseph's, he developed a reputation for attention seeking and storytelling. After school, he never held down a steady job and drifted into heroin addiction and homelessness. At the time of his arrest for the Grangegorman murders, he had one conviction for burglary, and had been involved in a number of syringe robberies.|$|E

The population of pupils with severe <b>learning</b> <b>disabilities</b> is very diverse; therefore, their emotional states and reactions when coping with difficulties are diverse as well. Based on the results of researches conducted by several experts, we can infer that students with severe <b>learning</b> <b>disabilities</b> experience negative reactions by their peers more often (and other people in their surroundings), which can cause emotional crises. Since these pupils {{do not want to be}} stigmatized, they often hide their emotions or express them in socially less appropriate ways. The pupils, who are able to control their emotions appropriately, are more successful in school. The most active way of coping with peer problems for pupils with severe <b>learning</b> <b>disabilities</b> is for them to address the issue, whereas the strategy of hiding the problems may cause psychosocial difficulties...|$|R
