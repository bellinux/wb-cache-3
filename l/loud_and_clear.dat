25|$|Warbucks angrily kicks {{him into}} a vase (leaving an imprint of his shoe on his backside) while berating him again for his brazen interfering, and he storms out the door, smashing the windows. He vows that when he and Annie returned, {{there would be some}} major changes made, and he made sure his nasty wife knew that <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> <b>clear.</b>|$|E
60|$|The sound became <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>clearer.</b> The echo {{was still}} continuous, {{but the sound}} of the shots could be {{distinctly}} heard.|$|R
60|$|When {{the sheik}} woke, after two hours' sleep, he drank some broth. His voice was <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>clearer,</b> <b>and</b> {{it was evident}} that even the small {{quantity}} that he had taken before, and the quiet sleep, had refreshed him greatly.|$|R
6000|$|And without, the wail came <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>clearer</b> still! [...] "If you sow the bread-fruit seed, {{you will}} reap the breadfruit. If you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind. They have eaten the storm-fruit. Oh, great king, save us!" ...|$|R
25|$|At Sacrifice on August 14, Truth and Konnan faced Kip James and The Alpha Male once more. On the July 29, 2005, {{episode of}} TNA Impact!, TNA Director of Authority Larry Zbyszko, citing fear from the referee {{team in the}} face of Kip and Monty's {{intentional}} targeting of them, named B.G. James the special guest referee for the match. B.G. proved his allegiance to 3LK after two months of silence, making his decision <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> <b>clear</b> when he stopped Kip from using a steel chair, then attacked Kip himself. Konnan got the pin, and 3Live Kru reunited and celebrated together after the match.|$|E
500|$|The first-person {{protagonist of}} Ms. Welch’s song ("Caleb Meyer") {{may be a}} young girl from {{a time and place}} that Ms. Welch will never fully understand, but the {{feelings}} the singer expresses about rape, and the respect she displays for her chosen musical genre, are nothing if not poignantly authentic. Likewise, it matters not whether Ms. Welch has ever walked the streets of [...] "the black dust towns of East Tennessee" [...] about which she sings in [...] "Miner's Refrain" [...] because the sense of foreboding that she expresses for the men who once labored in coal mines with futile hopes of a better life comes through <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> <b>clear.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 1961–62, the NBA's three highest scoring averages were {{by black}} players (Chamberlain, Baylor, Walt Bellamy). Oscar Robertson, a Hall of Famer, {{believes}} the NBA {{would have lost}} its small television contract and not survived without the emergence of black superstars. [...] "People heard about Wilt scoring a 100, averaging 50 a night, {{and they wanted to}} see the guy do it ... I believe Wilt Chamberlain single-handedly saved the league." [...] Naulls wrote, [...] "Wilt had rung the bell of freedom <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> <b>clear,</b> shouting, 'Let my people be free to express themselves.' For we were and will be for all time those who withstood the humiliation of racial quotas {{even to the point of}} the NBA's facing extinction because of retarded expression and stagnating growth." ...|$|E
5000|$|On that day, Parsons preached {{a notable}} {{sermon on the}} sacrifices {{of the dead and}} the duties of the living. [...] "As the clouds darkened and the skies thundered, the voice of Parsons grew <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>clearer,</b> like bugle notes {{summoning}} the good men and true to battle." ...|$|R
60|$|Then I lashed {{the tiller}} and went below {{to my own}} chest, where I got a soft silk {{handkerchief}} of my mother's. With this, and with my aid, Hands bound up the great bleeding stab he had received in the thigh, and after he had eaten a little and had a swallow or two more of the brandy, he began to pick up visibly, sat straighter up, spoke <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>clearer,</b> <b>and</b> looked in every way another man.|$|R
6000|$|At {{first that}} sound was very, very faint, but as Farmer Brown's boy listened, it grew <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>clearer.</b> Suddenly Farmer Brown's boy leaped up excitedly. [...] "That's Bowser!" [...] he cried. [...] "As sure as I live that's good old Bowser! I {{would know that}} voice among a million!" ...|$|R
500|$|In 1979, Gray {{spoke with}} TV Guide (Canada) and recounted: [...] "At first, {{they had no}} idea what to do with the part. Sue Ellen's lines ran to 'More coffee, darling?' and 'I have a headache.' Victoria Principal and Patrick Duffy were the goody-goodies. Jim Davis and Barbara Bel Geddes were parental. Hagman was the villain. And I was the redhead on the couch." [...] However, Gray was {{upgraded}} to a starring role once Dallas was picked up for a full season following the five episode arc miniseries. The actress later stated that on-screen husband Larry Hagman had criticized one of her performances early on during the start of the series, and called it [...] "terrible", though he denied it. She joked, [...] "I'm sorry. He said it to me <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> <b>clear,</b> and made me feel terrible, and it started one of our first fights on the way back [...] I swear to you—he devastated me. Then, years later, he said, 'Oh, I didn't mean that.' I could have killed him!" ...|$|E

50|$|During {{the late}} 60’s, Chijgamis became famous for playing Kabaddi and volleyball. Chijgam sent {{regularly}} Kabaddi and volleyball teams {{to compete at}} state level. During games, Chijgam’s musical themesong, “The Pride of Chijgam” was loudly played by local bands against rival bannds during {{what became known as}} a musical face-off. The band with the <b>loudest</b> <b>and</b> <b>clearest</b> sound often won the battle.|$|R
60|$|When {{the tracks}} of the horses were nearly hidden by the {{gathering}} dusk, Jonathan decided to halt for the night. He whistled one more note, <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>clearer,</b> <b>and</b> awaited the result with strained ears. The deep silence of the wilderness prevailed, suddenly to be broken by a faint, far-away, melancholy call of the hermit-thrush. It was the answering signal the borderman had hoped to hear.|$|R
60|$|And then {{suddenly}} we heard {{her in the}} distance. Very faint at first were the birr of wheels and the tat-tat-tat of the horses' feet. Then they grew <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>and</b> <b>louder</b> yet, until a pair of yellow lanterns swung round the curve, and in their light we saw the two big brown horses tearing along the high, blue carriage {{at the back of}} them. The postilion pulled them up panting and foaming within a few yards of us. In a moment we were at the window and had raised our hands in a salute to the beautiful pale face which looked out at us.|$|R
2500|$|... {{echoes of}} these {{arguments}} come across <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> <b>clear</b> in the Hamas covenant of 1988, bin Laden's {{declaration of war}} against the [...] "Zionist-Crusader alliance", Ahmadinejad's calls {{to wipe out the}} state of Israel, and TV programs in Arab countries that reproduce new versions of anti-Semitic blood libels.|$|E
2500|$|The U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's {{spokesman}} Stéphane Dujarric stated on 5 March, [...] "I'm {{not going}} to comment on the unspeakable comments that were made by the person accused of raping this girl, but I think the secretary-general has spoken very clearly on the need to halt violence against women and on the need for men to get involved in halting violence against women and decrying it <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> <b>clear</b> every time it occurs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nadaf {{believes}} that the Christian community should integrate more into mainstream Israeli society. He {{is in favor of}} recruiting Arabic-speaking Christians in the army, police and for sherut leumi (national service): [...] "Why do the Druze serve? Why do the Bedouin serve? But not the Christians?" [...] Naddaf asked during a Times of Israel interview. [...] "Because they are scared." [...] And that, he suggested, had to change. [...] "It is time to say in a <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> <b>clear</b> voice: enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hailing a cab at {{the door}} he hastened back to Paddington {{just in time for}} the Cornish express. This was surely a call. The words rang in his ears <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>clearer</b> than ever, [...] "Go, Michael, of {{celestial}} armies prince!" [...] He would go and obey them. He would trample under foot this foul fiend that masqueraded in human shape as his dear boy's murderer. He would wield once more that huge two-handed sword, brandished aloft, wide-wasting, in unearthly warfare. He would come out in his true shape before heaven and earth as the chief of the archangels.|$|R

50|$|The title {{sequence}} {{is accompanied by}} Artemyev's main theme. The opening sequence of the film showing Stalker's room is mostly silent. Periodically one hears {{what could be a}} train. The sound becomes <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>clearer</b> over time until the sound and the vibrations of objects in the room give a sense of a train's passing by without the train's being visible. This aural impression is quickly subverted by the muffled sound of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. The source of this music is unclear, thus setting the tone for the blurring of reality in the film. For this part of the film Tarkovsky was also considering music by Richard Wagner or the Marseillaise.|$|R
2500|$|At the time, Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code stated: [...] "A {{person who}} {{publicly}} insults the Republic or Turkish Grand National Assembly, shall be punishable by imprisonment of between {{six months to}} three years." [...] Pamuk was charged with violating this law in the interview. In October, after the prosecution had begun, Pamuk reiterated his views in a speech given during an award ceremony in Germany: [...] "I repeat, I said <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> <b>clear</b> that one million Armenians and 30,000 Kurds were killed in Turkey." ...|$|E
2500|$|As mayor, Bloomberg {{increased}} the mandatory minimum sentence for illegal {{possession of a}} loaded handgun, saying: [...] "Illegal guns don't belong on our streets and we're sending that message <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> <b>clear.</b> We're determined to see that gun dealers who break the law are held accountable, and that criminals who carry illegal loaded guns serve serious time behind bars." [...] He opposes the death penalty, saying he would [...] "rather lock somebody up and throw away the key {{and put them in}} hard labor". Bloomberg is a staunch proponent of stop-and-frisk in New York City and cited that Stop and Frisk dramatically reduced crime rates.|$|E
2500|$|... "Portrayed as disorganized and {{inferior}} grapplers, the ECW-WCW Team {{had more}} than {{its fair share of}} mistimed moves which hurt their own team members while the [...] "WWF squad" [...] of course wrestled like a well-oiled machine. The weakening of the ECW-WCW dubbed superstars didn't stop there either. The WWF faction battered their enemy tag partners off the ring apron over and over again making them appear weak and more times than not, the ECW-WCW grapplers gained an advantage only by double-teaming or employing underhanded tactics. The message sent was <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> <b>clear.</b> The [...] "best" [...] of ECW-WCW is not good enough to hang with the WWF." ...|$|E
6000|$|Tu-Kila-Kila made a wild {{effort to}} break away once more. But the King of Fire, {{standing}} opposite him, spoke still <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>clearer.</b> [...] "If you touch the Korong before the line is drawn," [...] he said, with a voice of authority, [...] "you are no Tu-Kila-Kila, but an outcast and a criminal. All the people will hold you with forked sticks, while the Korong burns you alive slowly, limb by limb, with me, who am Fire, the fierce, the consuming. I will scorch you and bake you till you are as a bamboo in the flame. Taboo! Taboo! Taboo! I, Fire, have said it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Peter listened. There {{were many}} songs, {{for it was}} a very {{beautiful}} morning and all the singers of the Old Orchard were pouring out the joy that was within them. One song was a little <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>clearer</b> than the others because it came from a tree very close at hand, the very tree from which those squeaky notes had come just a few minutes before. Peter suspected that that must be the song Jenny Wren meant. He looked puzzled. He was puzzled. [...] "Do you mean Welcome Robin's song?" [...] he asked rather sheepishly, for he had a feeling that he would be the victim of Jenny Wren's sharp tongue.|$|R
60|$|I {{saw that}} she was a good housekeeper, for while she talked she kept a corner of her eye on the {{servants}} to see that they made no balks in handling the body and getting it out; when they came with fresh clean towels, she sent back for the other kind; and when they had finished wiping the floor and were going, she indicated a crimson fleck the size of a tear which their duller eyes had overlooked. It was plain to me that La Cote Male Taile had failed to see the mistress of the house. Often, how <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>clearer</b> than any tongue, does dumb circumstantial evidence speak.|$|R
2500|$|In 2002, on the {{initiative}} of U.S. Representative Vito Fossella (R-NY), in cooperation with an Italian-American deputation, the U.S. House of Representatives passed [...] United States HRes. 269 on Antonio Meucci stating [...] "that the life and achievements of Antonio Meucci should be recognized, and {{his work in the}} invention of the telephone should be acknowledged." [...] Within its preamble it stated that: [...] "if Meucci had been able to pay the $10 fee to maintain the caveat after 1874, no patent could have been issued to Bell." [...] The resolution's sponsor described it as [...] "a message that rings <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> <b>clear</b> recognizing the true inventor of the telephone, Antonio Meucci." ...|$|E
2500|$|The North Carr Lightship was {{launched}} in 1932 and created quite a stir in Edinburgh on account of her fog horn being tested while lying ¾ mile off Granton, Edinburgh in the Firth of Forth. As the fog horn had a range of approximately 10 miles, north Edinburgh could hear it <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> <b>clear</b> and the complaints were numerous - particularly as it was being sounded in clear weather. [...] "Hundreds of city dwellers have had no sleep over three consecutive nights" [...] and [...] "The most flagrant individual breach of the peace is as nothing compared with the ceaseless boom and consequent suffering {{of the past three}} nights" [...] were typical statements at the time.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} {{magazines}} such as HM gave Hellig Usvart good reviews, and later critics such as Matt Morrow of The Whipping Post gave the album 10/10, writing [...] "...this album was {{made more than}} anything, to make a point. It made that point <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> <b>clear,</b> and it also kicked the door wide open and {{paved the way for}} many Christian black metal bands in the future to bring the light of Christ to an extremely dark music scene." [...] In 2010, HM Magazine listed Hellig Usvart #63 on its Top 100 Christian Rock Albums of All Time list stating that it [...] "kicked off a Christocentric infiltration of black metal culture" [...] and it [...] "holds up as a righteously furious assault".|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} debate in South East Asia {{regarding}} Asian perspectives in news reporting. This has been triggered by {{the aftermath of the}} Asian financial crisis. Commentators and politicians in the region have claimed that Western media reporting has played a role in undermining their economies. There is a strong feeling that their negative reporting of the region impacted on the loss of investor confidence There are also counter moves to establish an ‘Asian Media’, where the voices of the Asian people will be heard much <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>clearer.</b> This paper attempts {{to look at some of}} the issues underlining these moves and how such an indigenous media could develop and what bottlenecks may lie ahead...|$|R
50|$|The zhongruan {{plays the}} role of the tenor in this section. Its four strings are tuned to G2-D3-G3-D4. The {{instrument}} can be played using a plectrum similar to a guitar pick, as with the liuqin, or using a set of 2 to 5 acrylic fingernails. Mainstream ruan players use plectrums, though there are some schools which teach the fingernail technique, {{similar to that of the}} pipa. Pipa players who play ruan as a second instrument also use fingernails. Plectrums produce a <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>clearer</b> tone, which makes them suitable for orchestral use. Fingernails allow performance of polyphonic solo music, however this advantage is not useful in orchestras, where the zhongruan mainly plays the accompaniment. It possesses a very mellow tone.|$|R
5000|$|In 1498, {{when the}} {{returning}} Vasco da Gama fleet {{landed on the}} island of Angediva, about 20 {{miles off the coast of}} Goa, Gaspar da Gama, uninvited, went on the ship of Vasco da Gama and asked happily to go aboard, to visit his native Spain. He was then more than 50 years age, with white beard, with <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>clear</b> manners than that of the Indians of region. As reported by Álvaro Velho, clerk of the Portuguese fleet, Gaspar da Gama said that he was [...] "working for a powerful lord who owns an army of more than 40 thousand horsemen, and that upon hearing of their arrival he had asked to see them.
