5|$|Beyond the band's {{specific}} {{legal issues}} and {{insight into the}} making of the new album, the film also examines the state of the modern music industry as a whole, focusing on the complex relationships between major <b>labels</b> <b>and</b> their artists. Other musicians give their first-hand accounts of their own experiences in the business. The logistics and economics of how a record company works are explained by music industry insiders, including former EMI employees, music producers and music journalists. They trace the impact of the growing American economic recession on the industry, wherein many companies were taken over by larger groups who thought they could save them. In this instance, Terra Firma Capital Partners sought to rescue EMI despite having little experience in music management.|$|E

5|$|Boult's {{recordings}} {{fall into}} three main periods. In the first, from 1920 {{to the end}} of the 1940s, he recorded almost exclusively for HMV. In the 1950s and early 1960s, he was less in demand by the major <b>labels,</b> <b>and</b> although he made a substantial number of discs for Decca, he recorded mostly for smaller labels, chiefly Pye Nixa. His last period, from the mid-1960s, sometimes referred to as his Indian Summer, was once again with HMV. With his regular collaborators the producer Christopher Bishop and the engineer Christopher Parker he made more than sixty recordings, re-recording much of his key repertoire in stereo. He also added many works to his discography that he had not recorded before.|$|E

5|$|It {{took several}} years for Ivy to {{finalize}} the material {{included on the}} album, due {{to the birth of}} lead singer Dominque Durand and musician Andy Chase's daughter, Justine, in 1999. During the album's recording and writing process, Ivy experienced several unexpected events. Following their drop from Epic Records in 1999, the recording suffered further delays after their New York City studio burned down. After being without a record label, they considered signing to Japanese music group EastWest to strengthen their fan base. However, independent record label Nettwerk offered to fund the album; Ivy signed with both <b>labels</b> <b>and</b> began preparing it for a national release.|$|E
40|$|The {{required}} {{amount of}} labeled training data for object detection and classification {{is a major}} drawback of current methods. Combining <b>labeled</b> <b>and</b> unlabeled data via semisupervised learning holds the promise to ease the tedious <b>and</b> time consuming <b>labeling</b> effort. This paper presents a novel semi-supervised learning method which combines the power of learned similarity functions and classifiers. The approach capable of exploiting both <b>labeled</b> <b>and</b> unlabeled data is formulated in a boosting framework. One classifier (the learned similarity) serves as a prior which is steadily improved via training a second classifier on <b>labeled</b> <b>and</b> unlabeled samples. We demonstrate the approach on challenging computer vision applications. First, we show how we can train a classifier using only a few <b>labeled</b> samples <b>and</b> many unlabeled data. Second, we improve (specialize) a state-of-the-art detector by using <b>labeled</b> <b>and</b> unlabeled data. 1...|$|R

Part of the gap between Energy Efficiency Grade <b>Label</b> <b>and</b> Korea Eco-Label was observed in the path from PV to LA. The PV gap between Energy Efficiency Grade <b>Label</b> <b>and</b> Korea Eco-Label was 3.13 without and 2.8 with a green card, which was relatively high compared with the SV gap between both labels. The SV gap between Energy Efficiency Grade <b>Label</b> <b>and</b> Korea Eco-Label was 0.81 without and 1.38 with a green card. The larger PV gap between Energy Efficiency Grade <b>Label</b> <b>and</b> Korea Eco-Label resulted in a larger gap in the path to LA.|$|R

5|$|Marshmallow fluff, {{one of the}} {{two main}} {{ingredients}} of a Fluffernutter, was invented in the early 20th century. Archibald Query invented a creation he called Marshmallow Creme in Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1917, while Amory and Emma Curtis of Melrose, Massachusetts, invented Snowflake Marshmallow Creme in 1913. During World War I, Emma Curtis published a recipe for the Liberty Sandwich, which consisted of peanut butter and Snowflake Marshmallow Creme on oat or barley bread. The recipe was published in a promotional booklet sent to Curtis' customers in 1918 and may be the origin of the Fluffernutter sandwich. Earlier <b>labels</b> <b>and</b> booklets published by the Curtises suggested combining Snow Flake Marshmallow Creme with peanut butter or eating it on sandwiches with chopped nuts or olives.|$|E

Although the book did not sell well, its entry on 1960s folk artist John Fahey, written by Byron Coley, helped renew interest in Fahey's music. According to Ben Ratliff from The New York Times, this led to substantial interest in Fahey from record <b>labels</b> <b>and</b> the alternative music scene, helping revive his career.|$|E
5|$|The {{music that}} would {{ultimately}} become the Hybrid Theory album was first produced by Linkin Park in 1999 as a nine-track demo tape.

However, they were initially {{turned down by}} most of the major <b>labels</b> <b>and</b> several independent record labels. The band was signed by Warner Bros.

5|$|Tinne bought {{multiple}} {{versions of}} the same item, often leaving them in the original tissue paper, with the original price <b>labels</b> <b>and</b> delivery dates. Many of the higher value items were never worn, possibly because Tinne did not attend functions which would allow them to be due to her husband's evening surgeries. Tinne's daughter, Alexine suggests that Emily may have purchased excess items or high value items that she did not want, to allow the shop assistants to gain commission. This view is backed up by the curator of the exhibition, Pauline Rushton, who describes Tinne's social work in organising widows' pensions or helping unmarried mothers. However, fashion author Linda Grant believes it was more likely that she just enjoyed shopping.|$|E

In this paper we propose a new problem we have called particularization and a way to solve it. We also propose a new technique for mixing <b>labelled</b> <b>and</b> unlabelled data. This technique relies in the combination of supervised and unsupervised processes competing for the classification of each data point. Encouraging results on improving the classification outcome are obtained on MNIST database. ...|$|R
