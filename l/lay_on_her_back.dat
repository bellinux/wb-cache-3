2500|$|Soon after that, Changing Woman {{wished for}} a mate. Every {{morning when the}} sun rose she <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> until noon, {{her head to the}} west and her feet to the east. [...] At noon she went to the spring. She lay under the ledge and let spring water drip over her body. This took place each day for four days. On the fourth day, she heard a sound behind her and turned and saw a young man on a great white horse with black eyes. It had a long white mane, and pranced above the ground and not on the earth itself. The bridle and the saddle were white. The young man's moccasins and {{leggings}} were also white. The rider spoke: [...] "You lay towards me each morning until noon. When I am half over the center of the earth, you go to the spring. Your wish could not have two meanings. Go home and tell your father to build a brush hogan to the south of your home. Fill a basket with meal and set it in the hogan. Make a line of pollen from east to west across the basket on top of the meal. Make a line of pollen from north to south drawn around the basket. You and your father must sit there late into the night. He will then go home to his wife and you must stay there alone." ...|$|E

60|$|Over {{and over}} she rolled. Around and around she spun. She turned somersaults. She <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> and kicked her heels in the air. Never {{in his life}} had he known any one to act like that. There must be {{something}} the matter with her.|$|E

60|$|Slipping off {{her horse}} she <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> {{and at once}} {{everything}} was lost except the sky. Over her body, supported above solid earth by the warm, soft heather, the wind skimmed without sound or touch. Her spirit became one with that calm unimaginable freedom. Transported beyond her own contentment, she no longer even knew whether she was joyful.|$|R
60|$|Joel Creech {{did not say}} a word. His {{distorted}} {{face had}} the deriding scorn of a superior being. Lucy <b>lay</b> flat <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> watching him. <b>Her</b> mind worked swiftly. She would {{have to fight for}} her body and her life. Her terror had fled with her horror. She was not now afraid of this demented boy. She meant to fight, calculating like a cunning Indian, wild as a trapped wildcat.|$|R
60|$|As she <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> {{she could}} see nothing above her. She was not cold for the straw around her formed a warm bed, and her cloak had been {{carefully}} arranged so as to cover her completely, whilst her feet were wrapped up snugly in a rug.|$|E
60|$|It {{came from}} over the Downs, {{sweeping}} {{a rush of}} cold air on its wings, flighting towards the sea. With it the daring soon crept back into her blood. She stripped, and ran down into the dark water, fast growing pale. It covered her jealously, and she set to work to swim. The water was warmer than the air. She <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> and splashed, watching the sky flush. To bathe {{like this in the}} half-dark, with her hair floating out, and no wet clothes clinging to her limbs, gave her the joy of a child doing a naughty thing. She swam out of her depth, then scared at her own adventure, swam in again as the sun rose.|$|E
60|$|We worked feverishly at {{carrying}} our plunder on {{deck and}} depositing it amidships, so feverishly that Maud, whose strength {{was hardly a}} positive quantity, had to give over, exhausted, {{and sit on the}} steps at the break of the poop. This did not serve to recover her, and she <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> on the hard deck, arms stretched out, and whole body relaxed. It was a trick I remembered of my sister, and I knew she would soon be herself again. I knew, also, that weapons would not come in amiss, and I re-entered Wolf Larsen’s state-room to get his rifle and shot-gun. I spoke to him, but he made no answer, though his head was still rocking from side to side and he was not asleep.|$|E
50|$|A {{urethral}} bulking injection is {{one type}} of treatment for incontinence in women. Urethral bulking injections are considered by a clinician when the woman has urinary sphincter dysfunction, urethral hypermobility, persistent stress urinary incontinence after a urethral sling or urethropexy, or stress urinary incontinence in women who cannot undergo surgery due to other illnesses or conditions. It restores the ability to retain urine during coughing, laughing and other normal occurrences that increase inter-abdominal pressure Some women choose to have urethral bulking injections because they wish to avoid surgery {{or the use of}} mesh material. Another reason other treatments may not be chosen include the desire to maintain fertility. Woman who benefit most from this treatment are those who have a stable bladder neck and an inadequate muscle strength of the sphincter muscles that close the urethra. Urethral instability is identified by the angle of the urethra. This can be evaluated when the woman <b>lays</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> and the angle of the urethral is greater than 30° during coughing. Tests are performed to confirm the diagnosis of stress urinary incontinence such as the bladder capacity to hold urine and the strength of the bladder muscle contractions.|$|R

They were a pair--mother fat to despair of helplessness, Ahuna thin as a skeleton and as fragile. Of her one {{had the impression that}} if she <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> she could not roll over without the aid of block-and-tackle; of Ahuna one's impression was that the tooth- pickedness of him would shatter to splinters if one bumped into him.|$|R
60|$|Installed in a {{position}} of temporary authority, the parlour-maid sat silently at her needlework. Maria stood by the window, in the new character of an idle girl--with her handkerchief in her hand, and her everlasting book dropped unnoticed on the floor. Zo <b>lay</b> flat <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> <b>on</b> the hearth-rug, hugging the dog in her arms. At intervals, she rolled herself over slowly from side to side, and stared at the ceiling with wondering eyes. Miss Minerva's departure had struck the parlour-maid dumb, and had demoralized the pupils.|$|R
6000|$|But {{before long}} both Fynes became frightened. After {{a period of}} immobility {{in the arms of}} Mrs Fyne, the girl, who had not said a word, tore herself out from that {{slightly}} rigid embrace. She struggled dumbly between them, they did not know why, soundless and ghastly, till she sank exhausted on a couch. Luckily the children were out with the two nurses. The hotel housemaid helped Mrs Fyne to put Flora de Barral to bed. She was as if gone speechless and insane. She <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> her face white like a piece of paper, her dark eyes staring at the ceiling, her awful immobility broken by sudden shivering fits with a loud chattering of teeth in the shadowy silence of the room, the blinds pulled down, Mrs Fyne sitting by patiently, her arms folded, yet inwardly moved by the riddle of that distress of which she could not guess the word, and saying to herself: [...] "That child is too emotional-- much too emotional to be ever really sound!" [...] As if anyone not made of stone could be perfectly sound in this world. And then how sound? In what sense--to resist what? Force or corruption? And even in the best armour of steel there are joints a treacherous stroke can always find if chance gives the opportunity.|$|E
60|$|He saw great spiders there, with crowns {{and crosses}} marked on their backs, {{who sat in}} the middle of their webs, and when they saw Tom coming, shook them so fast that they became invisible. Then he saw lizards, brown and gray and green, and thought they were snakes, and would sting him; but they were as much frightened as he, and shot away into the heath. And then, under a rock, he saw a pretty sight--a great brown, sharp-nosed creature, with a white tag to her brush, and round her four or five smutty little cubs, the funniest fellows Tom ever saw. She <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> rolling about, and {{stretching}} out her legs and head and tail in the bright sunshine; and the cubs jumped over her, and ran round her, and nibbled her paws, and lugged her about by the tail; and she seemed to enjoy it mightily. But one selfish little fellow stole away from the rest to a dead crow close by, and dragged it off to hide it, though it was nearly as big as he was. Whereat all his little brothers set off after him in full cry, and saw Tom; and then all ran back, and up jumped Mrs. Vixen, and caught one up in her mouth, and the rest toddled after her, and into a dark crack in the rocks; and there was an end of the show.|$|E
6000|$|We {{are such}} stuff as dreams are made of. And as in a dream, or rather {{as part of}} a dream, and myself a phantom and a play-actor, I looked out over the side, and saw on the right the black Avails of Monos, on the left the black walls of Huevos--a gate even grander, though not as narrow, as that of Monos; and the Umbrella Rock, capped with Matapalo and Cactus, and night-blowing Cereus, dim in the dusk. And now we were outside. The roar of the surf, the tumble of the sea, the rush of the trade-wind, told us that at once. [...] Out in the great sea, with Grenada, and kind friends in it, ahead; not to be seen or reached till morning light. But we looked astern and not ahead. We could see into and through the gap in Huevos, through which we had tried to reach the Guacharo cave. Inside that notch in the cliffs must be the wooded bay, whence we picked up the shells among the fallen leaves and flowers. From under that dark wall beyond it the Guacharos must be just trooping out for their nightly forage, as they had trooped out since--He alone who made them knows how long. The outline of Huevos, the outline of Monos, were growing lower and grayer astern. A long ragged haze, far loftier than that on the {{starboard}} quarter, signified the Northern Mountains; and far off on the port quarter lay a flat bank of cloud, amid which rose, or seemed to rise, the Cordillera of the Main, and the hills where jaguars lie. Canopus blazed high astern, and Fomalhaut below him to the west, as if bidding us a kind farewell. [...] Orion and Aldebaran spangled the zenith. The young moon <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> in the far west, thin and pale, over Cumana and the Cordillera, with Venus, ragged and red with earth mist, just beneath. And low ahead, with the pointers horizontal, glimmered the cold pole-star, for which we were steering, out of the summer into the winter once more. We grew chill as we looked at him; and shuddered, it may be, cowered for a moment, at the thought of 'Niflheim,' the home of frosts and fogs, towards which we were bound.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} 1930, Adorée had {{appeared}} in 45 films, the last four of them were sound pictures. That year, {{she was diagnosed with}} tuberculosis and lived only a few years longer. Adorée went against her physician's advice by finishing her final film Call of the Flesh with Ramon Novarro. At its completion, she was rushed to a sanitarium in Prescott, Arizona, where she <b>lay</b> flat <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> for two years in an effort to regain her physical health. In April 1933, she left the sanitarium. At this point, it was thought she had recovered sufficiently to resume her screen career, but she swiftly weakened and her health declined day by day. She was moved from her modest home in the Tujunga Hills to the Sunland health resort in September 1933.|$|R
60|$|The act {{suggested}} {{the idea that}} we could not do better, so we placed two portmanteaus end to end, and thus made a couch about six feet long. A box, somewhat higher, placed at one end, served for a pillow, and on this one of the ladies <b>lay</b> down, flat <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> of course, that being the only possible position under the circumstances. A shawl was thrown over her, and she went to sleep like an effigy on a tombstone.|$|R
25|$|Police {{officers}} found a {{fire extinguisher}} and squirted its foam into {{the wounds of}} an injured occupant. Other occupants were thrown down the stairs head-first. Eventually, they dragged all occupants into the ground-floor hall, where they had gathered dozens of prisoners {{from all over the}} building in a mess of blood and excrement. They threw <b>her</b> <b>on</b> top of two other people. They were not moving, and Lena Zuhlke drowsily asked them if they were alive. They did not reply, and she <b>lay</b> there <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> unable to move her right arm, unable to stop her left arm and her legs twitching, blood seeping out of her head wounds. A group of police officers walked by, and each one lifted the bandana which concealed his identity, leaned down and spat <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face. Many victims of the raid were taken to the San Martino hospital, where police officers walked up and down the corridors, slapping their clubs into the palms of their hands, ordering the injured not to move around or look out of the window, keeping handcuffs on many of them and then, often with injuries still untended, shipping them across the city to join scores of others, from the Diaz school and from the street demonstrations, detained at the detention centre in the city's Bolzaneto district.|$|R
6000|$|At {{this moment}} the Prince perceived, a short {{distance}} behind Mahbracca, a small, black, and shining demon, whom he immediately recognized as the little fellow {{he had seen in}} pickle. The young rascal was pulling and tugging at a great wire machine that had been dropped by the followers of Mahbracca when they ran away. He beckoned to the Prince to come and help him; and the latter, whispering to the Princess to keep behind the Giant, slipped quietly around {{to the rear of the}} angry sorceress, and assisted the little fellow to place the wire affair (which was nothing less than the [...] "prince-trap" [...] that Mahbracca had made) directly behind the old hag, with the door right at her back. The Giant, perceiving this rapidly performed stratagem, raised his club, and made a step forward, as if, with one blow, he would crush Mahbracca, who was just beginning to find her tongue. Startled by this sudden action, she stepped back quickly, and stumbled right over into the [...] "prince-trap." [...] For an instant she <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> astounded, but quickly perceiving her predicament, she sprang to her feet, and with loud yells tried her best to get out. But it was of no use. The trap was made by the best rules of magic, and there was no such a thing as getting out, even if one was as small as a mouse. As for the little black fellow who had been in pickle, he laughed and danced until the old woman, glaring at him between the wires, ordered him to turn into a toad. But, unfortunately for her, she had dropped her magic wand outside of the cage, as she fell in, and the little demon, seeing this, merely laughed in her face, and running to the wand, picked it up, and ordered her to turn into a jackass, which she immediately did, and began to bray horribly. The little wretch was so delighted with this feat, that he turned about a dozen somersaults, and then, for the amusement of the Giant and his friends, he changed the old sorceress successively into a lion, a pig, an old hen, a turtle, a kangaroo, a boa-constrictor, an ape, a lobster, a cat, a crocodile, and a crane. He declared his intention of going through these exercises until he had used up the whole animal kingdom, and seemed delighted to think that he could have a complete menagerie in one cage. In order that he might pursue his amusement without interruption, the Giant put him, with the cage, on the top of the tower; and when our friends left the hollow mountain through the gap the Giant had made, the poor sorceress was being changed from bird to beast, and from beast to fish or reptile, as fast as the little demon was satisfied with her performance in any one character; and he may be keeping up this amusing pastime yet, for all I know.|$|E
6000|$|These grave dancing fairies {{were very}} unlike the Grey Women, {{and they were}} {{glad to see the}} boy, and treated him kindly. Then they asked him why he had come; and he told them how he was sent to find the Sword of Sharpness and the Cap of Darkness. And the fairies gave him these, and a wallet, and a shield, and belted the sword, which had a diamond blade, round his waist, and the cap they set on his head, and told him that now even they could not see him though they were fairies. Then he took it off, and they each kissed him and wished him good fortune, and then they began again their eternal dance round the golden tree, for it is their {{business}} to guard it till the new times come, or till the world's ending. So the boy put the cap on his head, and hung the wallet round his waist, and the shining shield on his shoulders, and flew beyond the great river that lies coiled like a serpent round the whole world. And by the banks of that river, there he found the three Terrible Women all asleep beneath a poplar tree, and the dead poplar leaves lay all about them. Their golden wings were folded and their brass claws were crossed, and two of them slept with their hideous heads beneath their wings like birds, and the serpents in their hair writhed out from under the feathers of gold. But the youngest slept between her two sisters, and she <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> with her beautiful sad face turned to the sky; and though she slept her eyes were wide open. If the boy had seen her he would have been changed into stone by the terror and the pity of it, she was so awful; but he had thought of a plan for killing her without looking on her face. As soon as he caught sight of the three from far off he took his shining shield from his shoulders, and held it up like a mirror, so that he saw the Dreadful Women reflected in it, and did not see the Terrible Head itself. Then he came nearer and nearer, till he reckoned that he was within a sword's stroke of the youngest, and he guessed where he should strike a back blow behind him. Then he drew the Sword of Sharpness and struck once, and the Terrible Head was cut from the shoulders of the creature, and the blood leaped out and struck him like a blow. But he thrust the Terrible Head into his wallet, and flew away without looking behind. Then the two Dreadful Sisters who were left wakened, and rose in the air like great birds; and though they could not see him because of his Cap of Darkness, they flew after him up the wind, following by the scent through the clouds, like hounds hunting in a wood. They came so close that he could hear the clatter of their golden wings, and their shrieks to each other: [...] "here, here," [...] "no, there; this way he went," [...] as they chased him. But the Shoes of Swiftness flew too fast for them, and at last their cries and the rattle of their wings died away as he crossed the great river that runs round the world.|$|E

5000|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sing J. Lee and shot in Los Angeles. It opens to a clock ticking counting down, and flashing quick glimpses of other scenes, some {{from the rest of}} the video, including the main character escaping down a hallway, screaming at the camera and counting calendar days in vivid red lighting, as well as numerous images of a similarly lit flower. These brief images repeat throughout the video. Shots of the band performing on a large indoor stage with bright, dynamic lighting are spliced throughout between the story scenes. Two scientists are shown discussing design plans for a female android posted on a wall in their workplace. A woman sleeps in a bed with a monitor <b>on</b> <b>her</b> wrist and an electronic device placed around her head, with several doctors monitoring her through the glass wall, watching what appears to be a simulation being created for her through the device on a screen, and tapping a button marked [...] "days to reset" [...] on another as it counts down and cycles through the days of the week. The woman's sleep appears to be getting less restful from the simulation as she fidgets and begins breathing harder. She is shown walking out onto a rooftop and taking a transparent rake from one of the men escorting her, redrawing the lines in a large sand garden, and looking out at the city around them before she and two of the men go back inside. We see her in the same room and on the same bed as before, but without the electronic devices, leaning away from an unknown man with a somewhat frightened expression as he lifts her chin to look at him and then begins undressing himself. Shots are shown of her flipping through a journal with a loose note stuck into it, reading [...] "you are stronger than you think." [...] She goes up to the rooftop to draw in the sand again, only this time bumps into an exact duplicate of herself accompanied by two different men, as both women take a moment to stare at each other in shock. She is later seen laying in bed, again without the devices, appearing to contemplate the emotions of these recent encounters. She is then shown looking through the glass wall of a small room, filled with sixteen more of the duplicates, standing but deactivated. She places a new note in the journal atop the other, reading [...] "look right. You are stronger in numbers." [...] On the last day before the reset, the version of her with the simulation device suddenly startles awake, tears off the device and snaps it in half before throwing a stack of books from the nightstand through the window and escaping. We see her weave through numerous people trying to catch her, the source of some of the shots spread through the rest of the video, before she locks herself in a small room, containing a [...] "final reset" [...] button which she presses. She steps up onto a platform that <b>lays</b> <b>her</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> as she appears to deactivate, before we see every one of the sixteen other duplicates wake up.|$|R
60|$|Five {{ships were}} {{immediately}} menaced {{with the same}} destruction. The Eber vanished--the four poor survivors on shore--read a dreadful commentary on their danger; which was swelled out of all proportion by the violence of their own movements as they leaped and fell among the billows. By seven the Nipsic was so fortunate as to avoid the reef and beach upon a space of sand; where she was immediately deserted by her crew, {{with the assistance of}} Samoans, not without loss of life. By about eight it was the turn of the Adler. She was close down upon the reef; doomed herself, it might yet be possible to save a portion of her crew; and for this end Captain Fritze placed his reliance on the very hugeness of the seas that threatened him. The moment was watched for with the anxiety of despair, but the coolness of disciplined courage. As she rose on the fatal wave, her moorings were simultaneously slipped; she broached to in rising; and the sea heaved her bodily upward and cast her down with a concussion on the summit of the reef, where she <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> beam-ends, <b>her</b> <b>back</b> broken, buried in breaching seas, but safe. Conceive a table: the Eber in the darkness had been smashed against the rim and flung below; the Adler, cast free in the nick of opportunity, had been thrown upon the top. Many were injured in the concussion; many tossed into the water; twenty perished. The survivors crept again on board their ship, as it now lay, and as it still remains, keel to the waves, a monument of the sea's potency. In still weather, under a cloudless sky, in those seasons when that ill-named ocean, the Pacific, suffers its vexed shores to rest, she lies high and dry, the spray scarce touching her--the hugest structure of man's hands within a circuit of a thousand miles--tossed up there like a schoolboy's cap upon a shelf; broken like an egg; a thing to dream of.|$|R

The corpse of his mad self-love uprose from rags and destitution as from the dark horrors of a tomb. It is impossible to say how much he lied to Jim then, how much he lied to me now--and to himself always. Vanity plays lurid tricks with our memory, and the truth of every passion wants some pretence to make it live. Standing at the gate of the other world {{in the guise of a}} beggar, he had slapped this world's face, he had spat on it, he had thrown upon it an immensity of scorn and revolt at the bottom of his misdeeds. He had overcome them all--men, women, savages, traders, ruffians, missionaries--and Jim--"that beefy-faced beggar." [...] I did not begrudge him this triumph in articulo mortis, this almost posthumous illusion of having trampled all the earth under his feet. While he was boasting to me, in his sordid and repulsive agony, I couldn't help thinking of the chuckling talk relating to the time of his greatest splendour when, during a year or more, Gentleman Brown's ship was to be seen, for many days on end, hovering off an islet befringed with green upon azure, with the dark dot of the mission-house on a white beach; while Gentleman Brown, ashore, was casting his spells over a romantic girl for whom Melanesia had been too much, and giving hopes of a remarkable conversion to her husband. The poor man, some time or other, had been heard to express the intention of winning [...] "Captain Brown to a better way of life." [...] "Bag Gentleman Brown for Glory"--as a leery-eyed loafer expressed it once--"just to let them see up above what a Western Pacific trading skipper looks like." [...] And this was the man, too, who had run off with a dying woman, and had shed tears over her body. [...] "Carried on like a big baby," [...] his then mate was never tired of telling, [...] "and where the fun came in may I be kicked to death by diseased Kanakas if I know.

[...] I remembered all these stories while, wiping his matted lump of a beard with a livid hand, he was telling me from his noisome couch how he got round, got in, got home, on that confounded, immaculate, don't-you-touch-me sort of fellow. He admitted that he couldn't be scared, but there was a way, [...] "as broad as a turnpike, to get in and shake his twopenny soul around and inside out and upside down--by God!"' ...|$|R

60|$|When {{they stopped}} for tea, {{instead of running}} home as usual, she drank it cold out of a flask she had brought, ate a bun and some chocolate, and <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> against the hedge. She always avoided that group of her fellow workers round the tea-cans which the farmer's wife brought out. To avoid people, if she could, had become {{habitual}} to her now. They must know about her, or would soon if she gave them the chance. She had never lost consciousness of her ring-finger, expecting every eye to fall on it {{as a matter of}} course. Lying <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face, she puffed her cigarette into the grass, and watched a beetle, till one of the sheep-dogs, scouting for scraps, came up, and she fed him with her second bun. Having finished the bun, he tried to eat the beetle, and, when she rescued it, convinced that she had nothing more to give him, sneezed at her, and went away. Pressing the end of her cigarette out against the bank, she turned over. Already the driver was perched on his tiny seat, and his companion, whose business it was to free the falling corn, was getting up alongside. Swish-swish! It had begun again. She rose, stretched herself, and went <b>back</b> to <b>her</b> place in the row. The field would be finished to-night; she would have a lovely rest-all Sunday I Towards seven o'clock a narrow strip, not twenty yards broad, alone was left. This last half hour was what Noel dreaded. To-day it was worse, for the farmer had no cartridges left, and the rabbits were dealt with by hullabaloo and sticks and chasing dogs. Rabbits were vermin, of course, and ate the crops, and must be killed; besides, they were good food, and fetched two shillings apiece; all this she knew but to see the poor frightened things stealing out, pounced on, turned, shouted at, chased, rolled over by great swift dogs, fallen on by the boys and killed and carried with their limp grey bodies upside down, so dead and soft and helpless, always made her feel quite sick. She stood very still, trying not to see or hear, and in the corn opposite to her a rabbit stole along, crouched, and peeped. 'Oh!' she thought, 'come out here, bunny. I'll let you away--can't you see I will? It's your only chance. Come out!' But the rabbit crouched, and gazed, with its little cowed head poked forward, and its ears laid flat; it seemed trying to understand whether this still thing in front of it was the same as those others. With the thought, 'Of course it won't while I look at it,' Noel turned her head away. Out {{of the corner of her}} eye she could see a man standing a few yards off. The rabbit bolted out. Now the man would shout and turn it. But he did not, and the rabbit scuttled past him and away to the hedge. She heard a shout from the end of the row, saw a dog galloping. Too late! Hurrah! And clasping her hands, she looked at the man. It was Fort! With the queerest feeling--amazement, pleasure, the thrill of conspiracy, she saw him coming up to her.|$|R

50|$|Odell {{was one of}} {{the longest}} time users of an iron lung, being {{confined}} to it for nearly 60 years. Currently, it is estimated that only 30 people in the United States still rely on iron lungs but few users are confined to them all the time. Odell's Iron lung, which was seven feet long and weighed 750 pounds, produced positive and negative pressures that forced air into her lungs and then expelled it. She <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> with only her head exposed and made eye contact with visitors through an angled mirror. She was able to operate a television set with a small blow tube. She was cared for by her parents, other family members and aides provided by a nonprofit foundation.|$|E
5000|$|With Allies Miller danced a solo called Rain, which {{received}} more favorable reviews than Allies for its innovative movement: Acocella described how Miller, {{wearing a red}} velvet dress, <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> and crawled feet first onto a carpet made of real grass and earth. While critics generally viewed Rain as a blend of Miller's personal vision with social commentary on everything from the environment to African liberation—symbolically, the colors in the piece were black, red, and green—Miller has said that Rain {{is more of a}} spiritual journey to the interior than a search for roots. As she told Bromberg, [...] "You're not left with the fact of blackness but the fact of me. And I think {{that has to do with}} where I'm going. And I might be going there because of my blackness and my femaleness. But it's a place everybody can go." ...|$|E
5000|$|Soon after that, Changing Woman {{wished for}} a mate. Every {{morning when the}} sun rose she <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> until noon, {{her head to the}} west and her feet to the east. At noon she went to the spring. She lay under the ledge and let spring water drip over her body. This took place each day for four days. On the fourth day, she heard a sound behind her and turned and saw a young man on a great white horse with black eyes. It had a long white mane, and pranced above the ground and not on the earth itself. The bridle and the saddle were white. The young man's moccasins and {{leggings}} were also white. The rider spoke: [...] "You lay towards me each morning until noon. When I am half over the center of the earth, you go to the spring. Your wish could not have two meanings. Go home and tell your father to build a brush hogan to the south of your home. Fill a basket with meal and set it in the hogan. Make a line of pollen from east to west across the basket on top of the meal. Make a line of pollen from north to south drawn around the basket. You and your father must sit there late into the night. He will then go home to his wife and you must stay there alone." ...|$|E
