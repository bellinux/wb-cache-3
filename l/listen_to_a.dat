The Balearic shearwater, considered critically endangered with extinction by the IUCN and seldom sighted in the UK, has {{been seen in the}} area. Other rare birds spotted here include the purple heron, the pink-footed goose, the European honey buzzard and the melodious warbler.

5|$|A {{ceremony}} is held each October 13 at the outfield wall in Oakland to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> taped {{broadcast of the}} final game of the 1960 World Series. The tradition was started by Squirrel Hill resident Saul Finkelstein, who at 1:05 pm on October 13, 1985, sat alone {{at the base of the}} flagpole and listened to the NBC radio broadcast of Chuck Thompson and Jack Quinlan. Finkelstein continued the tradition for eight more years, until word spread and other people began attending in 1993. On October 13, 2000—the game's 40th anniversary—over 600people attended to listen to the broadcast, including Mazeroski himself. For the 50th anniversary, on October 13, 2010, a plaque honoring Mazeroski was dedicated and more than 1,000 attended the broadcast, including Mazeroski and several other former Pirates.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of 100% Love (2011), Akkineni Nagarjuna decided to act and produce in an all-star film along with his father, actor Akkineni Nageswara Rao and elder son Naga Chaitanya. Nageswara Rao {{suggested}} Nagarjuna to begin the film as early as possible, because of his age. After examining and rejecting many scripts due to a perceived lack of novelty, Nagarjuna was advised by actor Nithin's father and distributor Sudhakar Reddy to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> script by Vikram Kumar, who was directing Nithin and Nithya Menen in Ishq (2012). Although he liked the script after the first narration, he agreed {{to act in the}} film only after watching Ishq before its theatrical release.|$|E

Those to whom God was presented as female were more likely to emphasize God 2 ̆ 7 s mercy at posttest whereas those to whom God was presented as male were more likely to endorse God 2 ̆ 7 s power. Those hearing a male voice describe a female God and those hearing a female voice describe a male God reported enjoying the experiment and the audiotape more than those hearing a narrator describing a God of the same gender.

The Dundies are an annual award program created by Michael to motivate his employees. The idea of performance is worrisome to Deangelo, but Michael insists he take the job. Michael brings some of the staff together {{in the conference room}} to help Deangelo get prepared for the show, but he struggles to be humorous. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) tries to help him, saying he should just think of performing like conducting a meeting, but Michael objects, wanting Deangelo to mimic his style. Michael tries a number of different things to help Deangelo, such as sitting on his stomach and making him <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Walkman at full volume so he cannot hear himself think, but none are effective.|$|E
5|$|During the 2004 trial {{regarding}} {{allegations of}} Rush Limbaugh's drug abuse, the ACLU argued that his privacy {{should not have}} been compromised by allowing law enforcement examination of his medical records. In June 2004, the school district in Dover, Pennsylvania, required that its high school biology students <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> statement which asserted that the theory of evolution is not fact and mentioning intelligent design as an alternative theory. Several parents called the ACLU to complain, because they believed that the school was promoting a religious idea in the classroom and violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The ACLU, joined by Americans United for Separation of Church and State, represented the parents in a lawsuit against the school district. After a lengthy trial, Judge John E. Jones III ruled in favor of the parents in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District decision, finding that intelligent design is not science and permanently forbidding the Dover school system from teaching intelligent design in science classes.|$|E

Dick (Ryan Hansen) has just returned, getting into Hearst, but he is shaken up from Beaver’s suicide. Vinnie (Ken Marino) approaches Keith (Enrico Colantoni) with a case, but he denies it.

5|$|A {{social worker}} announces to Brian {{and the rest}} of his family that Brian is sentenced to be put down by a lethal injection, which shocks everyone. While Peter works on Brian's appeal, Brian decides to study the Law as much as he can, and goes to court to defend himself, and finally gets the chance to plead his case before the Quahog City Council. During his parole hearing, he {{references}} the court case Plessy v. Ferguson, but unfortunately for him, the council believes that it's stupid to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dog. Just when Brian is about to be dismissed, Peter steps in and delivers a last-ditch emotional appeal on his behalf. The city council members remain unmoved until Peter bribes them with $20 each, and Brian is immediately freed. The charges against him are finally dropped and the town shows him new respect, allowing him to finally drink out of a water fountain, showing his status to be the same as that of the other citizens of the community. The family returns home and Stewie, in an unusual (at the time) display of respect towards Brian, bows ever so slightly towards him. Brian and Peter are then left alone. Brian licks Peter's face in an endearing dog gesture, and threatens to kill him if he ever tells anyone about it.|$|E
5|$|Denise Mina had {{not written}} for comics {{when she took}} over the title in 2006, but had three {{acclaimed}} crime novels to her name, the Garnetthill trilogy, {{the first of which}} won the CWA award for best debut crime novel. Her run on the title took John to Scotland, to attempt to stop a plot to make everybody empathise with each other. However, John fails to stop this, and, overwhelmed by the grief and horror they're forced to empathically share, suicides abound through the people of Glasgow. With help from Gemma Constantine, Angie Spatchcock and Chas Chandler, a plan to reverse the problem is made, as tension builds among the soldiers now surrounding the city. The soldiers keenly <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> World Cup match between England and Portugal on the radio. When England loses the match, it seems all is lost, but the expected psychic riot fails to materialize. The soldiers are Scottish, so England's loss is celebrated, saving the day, and proving there's no source of joy like Schadenfreude.|$|E

Diana tells him that she {{will have a lot}} of job offers in New York, but Paul says that no one will be interested as she is toxic. Diana's plane ticket is cancelled and she is thrown out of the hotel by Paul. She asks Declan for help and he tells her that Paul keeps his business papers in the home safe. Diana kisses Paul, {{and at the same time}} she takes his house keys from his pocket and she breaks into his house. Diana does not find anything and, in anger, she smashes Paul's possessions. Diana calls a mystery person and arranges for them to hurt Paul. She then goes to Rebecca and tells her about her husband's affair. Someone goes to the Lassiter's mezzanine and pushes Paul from it. Detective Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) discovers one of Diana's earrings at the scene and he stops her at the airport. During questioning, Diana tells him to speak to Rebecca again after revealing her affair with Paul.
