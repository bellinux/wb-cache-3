This renewed the interest in high performance and low power circuits with <b>threshold</b> <b>logic</b> gates. <b>Threshold</b> <b>Logic</b> Gates can be implemented using both the traditional CMOS technologies and the emerging nanoelectronic technologies. In this dissertation, we have performed performance analysis on Monostable-Bistable <b>Threshold</b> <b>Logic</b> Element based, current mode, and memristor based <b>threshold</b> <b>logic</b> implementations. Existing analytical approaches that model the delay of a Monostable-Bistable <b>Threshold</b> <b>Logic</b> Element <b>threshold</b> <b>logic</b> gate cannot explore the enormous search space in the quest of weight assignments on the inputs and threshold in order to optimize the delay of the <b>threshold</b> <b>logic</b> gate.

This quantity is used to form an integer linear program that optimizes the performance and ensure that each weight can tolerate a predetermined variation by an appropriate weight assignment in a <b>threshold</b> <b>logic</b> gate. The presented experimental results demonstrate the impact of the proposed method. The optimality of our solutions and the reported improvements ensure tolerance to potential manufacturing defects. Current mode is a popular CMOS-based implementation of <b>threshold</b> <b>logic</b> functions where the gate delay depends on the sensor size. A new implementation of current mode threshold functions for improved performance and switching energy is presented.

40|$|The {{rule-based}} <b>logic</b> <b>threshold</b> {{control strategy}} has been frequently used in energy management strategies for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) owing to its convenience in adjusting parameters, real-time performance, stability, and robustness. However, the <b>logic</b> <b>threshold</b> control parameters cannot usually ensure the best vehicle performance at different driving cycles and conditions. For this reason, the optimization of key parameters is important to improve the fuel economy, dynamic performance, and drivability.

40|$|<b>Threshold</b> <b>logic</b> gates gaining more {{importance}} {{in recent years}} due to the significant development in the switching devices. This renewed the interest in synthesis and testing of circuits with <b>threshold</b> <b>logic</b> gates. Two important synthesis considerations of <b>threshold</b> <b>logic</b> circuits are addressed namely, <b>threshold</b> <b>logic</b> function identification and reducing {{the total number of}} <b>threshold</b> <b>logic</b> gates required to represent the given boolean circuit description. A fast method to identify the given Boolean function as a <b>threshold</b> <b>logic</b> function with weight assignment is introduced. It characterizes the <b>threshold</b> <b>logic</b> function based on the modified chows parameters which results in drastic reduction in time and complexity. Experiment results shown that the proposed method is at least 10 times faster for each input and around 20 times faster for 7 and 8 input, when comparing with the algorithmic based methods. Similarly, it is 100 times faster for 8 input, when comparing with asummable method. Existing <b>threshold</b> <b>logic</b> synthesis methods decompose the larger input functions into smaller input functions and perform synthesis for them. This results in {{increase in the number of}} <b>threshold</b> <b>logic</b> gates required to represent the given circuit description. The proposed implicit synthesis methods increase the size of the functions that can be handled by the synthesis algorithm, thus the number of <b>threshold</b> <b>logic</b> gates required to implement very large input function decreases. Experiment results shown that the reduction in the TLG count is 24 % in the best case and 18 % on average. An automatic test pattern generation approach for transition faults on a circuit consisting of current mode <b>threshold</b> <b>logic</b> gates is introduced.
