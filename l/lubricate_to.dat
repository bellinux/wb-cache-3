2500|$|... "Jabberwocky" [...] {{has been}} {{translated}} into numerous languages, as the novel has {{been translated into}} 65 languages. The translation might be difficult because the poem holds to English syntax {{and many of the}} principal words of the poem are invented. Translators have generally dealt with them by creating equivalent words of their own. Often these are similar in spelling or sound to Carroll's while respecting the morphology of the language they are being translated into. In Frank L. Warrin's French translation, [...] "'Twas brillig" [...] becomes [...] "Il brilgue". In instances like this, both the original and the invented words echo actual words of Carroll's lexicon, but not necessarily ones with similar meanings. Translators have invented words which draw on root words with meanings similar to the English roots used by Carroll. Douglas Hofstadter noted in his essay [...] "Translations of Jabberwocky", the word 'slithy', for example, echoes the English 'slimy', 'slither', 'slippery', 'lithe' and 'sly'. A French translation that uses 'lubricilleux' for 'slithy', evokes French words like 'lubrifier' (to <b>lubricate)</b> <b>to</b> give an impression of a meaning similar to that of Carroll's word. In his exploration of the translation challenge, Hofstadter asks [...] "what if a word does exist, but it is very intellectual-sounding and Latinate ('lubricilleux'), rather than earthy and Anglo-Saxon ('slithy')? Perhaps 'huilasse' would be better than 'lubricilleux'? Or does the Latin origin of the word 'lubricilleux' not make itself felt to a speaker of French in the way that it would if it were an English word ('lubricilious', perhaps)? [...] ".|$|E

This {{eventually led to}} his jealous colleague and girlfriend Ka-lai's (Carrie Ng) attention, who thinks that her boyfriend is {{having an affair with}} some other women. Tensions and nervousness begin to <b>lubricate</b> <b>to</b> its peak when every invitations occur in a restaurant with all Chow, his wives, Chi-hung and Ka-lai meeting up together at the same time. Sally and Joey made good friends with Ka-lai,whereas Chow even ridiculously told Joey that he must pretend to be Sally's lover, so as Chi Hung being forced to pretend as Ka-lai's lover(in which both wives timidly believing that their husband's act is by helping Chi Hung getting off his peril, once again wiping out Ka-lai's suspicion). During their first year wedding anniversary, Sally and Joey ended up bumping onto each other again coincidentally (also with Ka-lai around) in a photo shop, and there the ladies finally discovered that their husband was all along a two timing bigamist via the display of their wedding albums; both with Chow as their husband (with Sally's in Paris, France and Joey's in America [...] ).|$|E

50|$|The rope is the {{defining}} characteristic of an elevated passenger ropeway. The rope stretches and contracts as the tension exerted upon it increases and decreases, and it bends and flexes as it passes over sheaves and around the bullwheels. The fibre core contains a lubricant which protects the rope from corrosion and also allows for smooth flexing operation. The rope must be regularly <b>lubricated</b> <b>to</b> ensure safe operation and long life.|$|R

40|$|Dense {{suspensions}} can exhibit {{an abrupt}} {{change in their}} viscosity in response to increasing shear rate. The origin of this discontinuous shear thickening (DST) has been ascribed to the transformation of <b>lubricated</b> contacts <b>to</b> frictional, particle-on-particle contacts. Recent research on the flowing and jamming behavior of dense suspensions has explored the intersection of ideas from granular physics and Stokesian fluid dynamics to better understand this transition from <b>lubricated</b> <b>to</b> frictional rheology. DST is reminiscent of classical phase transitions, and a key question is how interactions between the microscopic constituents {{give rise to a}} macroscopic transition. In this paper, we extend a formalism that has proven to be successful in understanding shear jamming of dry grains to dense suspensions. Quantitative analysis of the collective evolution of the contact-force network accompanying the DST transition demonstrates clear changes in the distribution of microscopic variables, and leads to the identification of an "order parameter" characterizing DST.

[...] All cast lead bullets, whether with or without a gas check, must still be <b>lubricated,</b> <b>to</b> prevent leading of the rifling of the barrel.

[...] Not all handloaders resize cast lead bullets, although all handloaders do lubricate cast lead bullets. [...] An option <b>to</b> using a <b>lubricating</b> press is simply to coat the bullets with bullet lube, which can be done either with a spray, in a tumbler, in a plastic bowel with a liquid lube, in a tray with melted bullet lube, or even with a manual lubricating process.|$|R

50|$|Crossing {{the tracks}} at Hyde Park {{is not only}} illegal but {{extremely}} dangerous, because Amtrak trains, {{as well as some}} express commuter trains (including almost all Franklin Line trains), pass through the station without stopping. The blind curve to the north makes it difficult to know if a train is coming; moreover, trains may operate in either direction on any track without warning, and without regard to any normally intuitive current of traffic. (Franklin Line trains in both directions largely use the westernmost track, while most Amtrak trains use the center track.) To discourage trespassers, the fence between tracks is <b>lubricated</b> <b>to</b> make hopping it more difficult. Despite these measures, several trespassers have been struck at Hyde Park, with the most recent fatality in September 2011.|$|R
