This led {{to a number of}} articles appearing in the media taking an in-depth <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Institute of Complementary Medicine, who are at the centre of this controversy. Not only did their attempt to block this nomination failed, but it also further exposed their unbridled support of pseudo-scientific complementary medicines. The university’s motivation for their continued support became clear, after they accepted an untied gift of $10 million [...] from the controversial [...] supplement company, Blackmores. These funds will partly be used to establish a traditional Chinese medicine 'hospital' in Sydney's health precinct, Westmead. The University will manage this 'hospital' because the public will be more at ease with such an controversial establishment if it is fully supported by a local university.|$|E

On 19 July 2017, Ambassador Hüseyin Müftüoğlu, {{in response to a}} question regarding the claims in the KRG press, claimed that they were distorting Turkey's position against the KRG's referendum decision. Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım has said: [...] "A decision by the authorities in the Kurdistan Region to hold a referendum on the independence of Kurdistan on September 25 is irresponsible". An AKP MP Mehmet Galip Ensarioğlu said: [...] "People should respect the decision of the people of Kurdistan". The head of the Nationalist Movement Party, Devlet Bahçeli, said, [...] "Let us <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> unity of our country, the Barzani gang would make a referendum on independence on September 25th, which is called disgrace, shame and betrayal." [...] The left-wing Peoples' Democratic Party supported the referendum.

5000|$|Those on {{the other}} side of the {{discussion}} do not feel that the funding costs are justified by the service that is provided by the school resource officers. Amanda Petteruti (2011) also discusses the issues of budget reductions in her article but she goes on to include that for the price of one school resource officer, most districts could hire one teacher and have money left over. The concerns expressed in Education Under Arrest regarding cost show that during times of budget cuts and financial shortfalls that school administrators should examine their operations and see if another service would benefit the school more than having a law enforcement officer on campus. In addition to the expense of the local officer, some <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> reductions that have been seen in the COPS grants that are administered by the United States Department of Justice. Those grants made their first major impact in 2000 when the grants provided money to employee almost 600 School resource officers in 289 different communities. The funding allocations peaked in 2002 then have decreased ever since. Some see this as a message that the issue is not a priority for the Department of Justice and those ideas are reinforced when you see large metropolitan school systems reduce the number of officers that they have on campuses. In addition, Amanda Petteruti (2011) argues that [...] "School resource officers are a relatively new means of maintaining school safety, having only gained real traction in schools in the 1990s. Experienced faculty and staff have been in schools for much longer and are trained to work with students to keep everyone at school safe and to maintain a positive learning environment."

40|$|One {{approach}} is to consider a specific piece of EU text {{in a range of}} languages and consider how the text is reproduced in each language in terms of structure and terminology. Since the original draft is frequently made by non-native speakers and then translated into the other EU languages, which are bound by the structure of the base version, we obtain little information from it about divergent national linguistic and legislative methods. However, if the EU text is a directive which is transposed into national law, we should be able also to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> implementing legislation intended to implement the directive. The implementing texts are produced within the national legal context and, one assumes, aim at similar results, as laid down by the directive. Thus it could be expected that they should provide vehicles for study between the national systems and between each national system and the EU legal order.

40|$|The Czech and Polish modernistic {{project of}} the {{critical}} national mythology is, in general, a form of the artist’s discussion with his own cultural tradition which was represented by the common, collective awareness.
