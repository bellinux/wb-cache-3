The main purpose of the study is to find out how the studyleave with pay policy is impacting teacher recruitment, motivation and retention in Ghana. The perennial vacant teaching post being created in the Ghana Education Service (GES) on daily basis has attracted my research interest into this study. In this study, (12) interview questions were used to solicit teachers’ view on the study <b>leave</b> with <b>pay</b> policy {{and its impact on}} teacher recruitment, motivation and retention. Three research questions were drawn up in order to meet this research aim: 1. How do teachers’ perceive the study <b>leave</b> with <b>pay</b> policy and its impact on teacher recruitment into initial teacher colleges of education? 2. How do teachers perceive the study <b>leave</b> with <b>pay</b> and its impact on teacher motivation in Ghana Education Service? 3. How do teachers perceive the study <b>leave</b> with <b>pay</b> and its impact on teacher retention in Ghana Education Service? Simple Random sampling was used to select (10) teachers, who have been on the study- <b>leave</b> with <b>pay</b> policy, 5 from each university for interviewing. The empirical data is collected using thematic interviews of (10) teachers. The study made use of phenomenographic research approach since the study concerns itself with teachers’ perception. The theoretical framework under which this study was carried out emanated from two major sources namely the interpretive approaches to policy and policy analysis. Data analysis was done using interview transcribing techniques. The key findings from this study are: 1. There is a strong perception among teachers studied that the conditionalities attached to study with pay is causing low recruitment into Initial Teacher College of Education, 2. The low motivation among teachers studied is attributable to the study <b>leave</b> with <b>pay</b> policy and 3. Most of the study <b>leave</b> with <b>pay</b> policy conditions function as a limitation to teacher retention in Ghana education service. On the basis of the findings, {{there seems to be some}} weakness in the policy and will therefore suggest a possible look at the policy again. The study suggests that government discontinue with the study <b>leave</b> with <b>pay</b> policy in that it continues to deprive the teaching profession of valuable assets. It recommends to government to shift policy completely by means of redefining teacher education thereby lifting teacher education to where it belongs...|$|R
