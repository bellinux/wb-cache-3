5|$|Adolf Hitler's {{sexuality}} has <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> {{matter of}} historical and scholarly debate. There {{is evidence that}} he had romantic encounters {{with a number of}} women during his lifetime, as well as evidence of his antipathy to homosexuality, and no evidence of homosexual encounters.

Another died of complications eight years after a suicide attempt, and one made a failed suicide attempt.|$|E

5|$|In late 1818, however, {{demand for}} U.S. goods fell sharply in Europe. Land values {{also began to}} fall, {{touching}} off the Panic of 1819. Many persons in the state were unable to repay their loans. A struggle began between creditors seeking to collect money owed to them and debtors seeking relief from obligations they could not meet. A Debt Relief Party sprang up in the state, which had <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> single-party bastion.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1877, Rimsky-Korsakov thought {{increasingly}} {{about the}} short story May Night by Nikolai Gogol. The story had <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> favorite of his, and his wife Nadezhda had encouraged him to write an opera based on it from the day of their betrothal, when they had read it together. While musical ideas for such a work predated 1877, now they came with greater persistence. By early 1878 the project took an increasing amount of his attention; in February he started writing in earnest, and he finished the opera by early November.|$|E

5|$|Palestine {{had been}} a British Mandate {{since the end of}} World War I. Under the terms of the mandate, Great Britain was {{responsible}} for the government and security of the country. It had <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> stated British aim to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine and between 1922 and 1939 over 250,000 Jewish immigrants had arrived in the country. However, Arab resistance and World War II prompted the British to curtail immigration. The time also saw the rise of the Jewish Resistance Movement, which eventually came into conflict with the British authorities.|$|E
5|$|Sectarian {{tensions}} have <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> {{cause of}} conflict at football matches in Northern Ireland, and crowd trouble occasionally marred games involving Linfield throughout the twentieth century.

5|$|Sviatoslav has <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> hero of Belarusian, Russian, and Ukrainian patriots due to {{his great}} {{military}} successes. His figure first attracted attention of Russian artists and poets during the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774), which provided obvious parallels with Sviatoslav's push towards Constantinople. Russia's southward expansion and the imperialistic ventures of Catherine II in the Balkans {{seemed to have been}} legitimized by Sviatoslav's campaigns eight centuries earlier.|$|E
5|$|The Webster Sycamore had <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> local {{landmark}} {{on account}} of its age and size, and was known locally as being the world's largest American sycamore.

5|$|The idea of {{attracting}} American fans through television has <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> {{goal of the}} CFL although {{the results have been}} intermittent.

The infamous Fog Bowl of 1962 was—at least until play was suspended—broadcast by ABC. Over subsequent years various non-major networks picked up an assortment of games.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclusion}} of significant LGBT characters in modern speculative fiction television series {{has not been}} universal. For example, the Star Trek franchise's lack of same-sex relationships has <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> sore spot with LGBT fandom, {{some of whom have}} organised boycotts against the franchise to protest its failure to include LGBT characters. They also point out that Gene Roddenberry had made statements in later life favourable to acceptance of homosexuality and the portrayal of same-sex relationships in Star Trek, but that the franchise's coverage has remained meagre.|$|E
