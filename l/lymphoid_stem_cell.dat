40|$|To {{study the}} {{occurrence}} of immunocompetent cells directly responsible for antibody production, cells from yolk sac, embryonic liver, bursa of Fabricius, bone marrow, spleen, or thymus were injected together with SRBC and Brucella abortus into 4 -day old cyclophosphamide-treated chicks. A second stimulation was given 4 days later, and samples taken 4 days thereafter were used for antibody titrations. During ontogeny, immunocompetent cells appeared in significant numbers first in the spleen for anti-SRBC responses, but in the bursa for anti-Brucella responses. Later these cells were also found in thymus and bone marrow. In the bursa, cells immunocompetent for anti-SRBC response were not encountered in significant numbers. The slight response to SRBC by transferred bursa cells reflects the presence of stem cells and their immediate descendents in the bursa {{at different stages of}} development. These findings are compared with the development and maturation of the stem cell responsible for humoral immunity. In the bursa, development of the stem cell population precedes that of immunocompetent cells. The opposite relationship was found in bone marrow, spleen, and thymus where immunocompetent cells were always present some weeks before the appearance of cells capable of achieving a long-lasting reconstitution of bursa-dependent functions. These observations reveal that the bursa seeds out immunocompetent cells during its entire postembryonic development, but does not release the <b>lymphoid</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> population before this population has matured sufficiently and before the bursa itself, after fulfilling its function, starts to involute...|$|E

Monoclonal mouse anti-rat thymocyte antibody W 3 / 13 labeled approximately 40 % of fetal liver cells and 60 - 70 % of young rat bone marrow cells (40 % brightly, 25 % dimly). Bright, dim, and negative cells were separated on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. All B and T <b>lymphoid</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in fetal liver were W 3 / 13 bright, as were B <b>lymphoid</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in bone marrow.

40|$|Leukemic {{diseases}} are proliferative processes of hematopoetic origin, where malignant alteration and proliferation can occur {{at each stage}} of blood cell development. On the stage of an immature cell a proliferative event is defined as an acute leukemia, whereas {{on the stage of}} a mature cell as a chronical leukemia. T lymphocytes (T cells) and Natural Killer cells (NK cells) are frequently involved in leukemic process. In physiological conditions, both cell types are involved in immune responses against viruses and to lesser extend against bacteria, protozoa and fungi. They differentiate from a multipotent <b>lymphoid</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell.</b> T lymphocytes (70 - 75 % of all lymphocytes and 20 - 30 % of the leukocytes) have been divided into subtypes according to their functions. Cytotoxic T cells (Tc) normally are involved in cellular immune responses, whereas T helper cells (Th) in regulation of both responses, cellular and humoral. Natural Killer cells (10 - 15 % of lymphocytes) are involved in non-specific cellular responses, -exhibiting natural killing activity of tumor and virally infected cells. This non-specific cellular activity (NK activity) is MHC- and antigen-independent. On the other hand they show antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Therefore NK cells are involved in early innate immune responses and antigen-specific, adaptive humoral responses. The cause of leukemia is only partially understood. It is a result of complex interaction of genetic and exogenous factors. Risk factors comprise ionizing radiation (X-rays), chemical leukemogenes (benzene), viruses (especially RNA-viruses like HTLV) or genetic / hereditary factors like chromosomal alteration (Philadelphia-Chromosome and other translocations; oncogenes / protooncogenes; Down syndrome). Due to uncontrolled division, leukocytes can invade tissues and organs other than bone marrow and blood. In Germany and other industrial countries about 8 to 11 individuals per 100 000 inhabitants suffer from various kinds of leukemia per year. In our experiments we used two established cell lines -Jurkat and NKL- obtained from leukemic patients. Jurkat cell line was obtained from a male acute T cell leukemia (T-ALL) patient and NKL cell line from a male acute Natural Killer cell leukemic patient (NK-LGL). The aim of our studies was to compare expression profiles of these two cell lines in order to identify cell-type-specific genes or gene families for these distinct types of cells and how they are related to immunological function, including new candidate genes. Furthermore we aim to relate gene-specific expression pattern to particular subtypes of leukemia. For this purpose we used an oligonucleotide fingerprinting method, which allows normalization of cDNA libraries as well as expression profiling studies and new candidate gene detection. This method allows not only for gene identification, but also quantitative expression studies. Moreover, oligonucleotide fingerprinting approach provided us with non-redundant cDNA clones array (unigene sets) for follow-up complex hybridization studies. Application of this method therefore allowed us to produce T cell and NK cell-specific unigene sets, representing non-redundant collection of cDNA clones, which will be subsequently used for complex hybridization studies...|$|E
40|$|<b>Stem</b> <b>cells,</b> the {{earliest}} precursor cells that populate the lymphoid and hemopoietic systems in mammals, {{have a very}} high proliferative capacity. They can be transplanted by intravenous injections of single-cell suspensions. Therefore, they are useful in determining whether somatic cells are timed to age as a result of intrinsic limits on proliferative capacity. Such a prediction has been made after studies with fibroblasts in vitro (1, 2). In many experiments, hemopoietic and <b>lymphoid</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> from old and young donors have repopulated recipients equally well, implying that changes with age are not intrinsic (3 - 8).

Basophilic cells were also seen in the loose connective tissue near the distal bursa, and in the vessels which were located dorsal to the distal bursa. They began to invade the epithelium at 10 and 11 days of incubation by digesting the basal laminar components which the fluorescent lectin probes stained. Haematopoietic <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> were in close association with the extracellular matrix in the mesenchyme and contained abundant F-actin.

40|$|The {{ontogeny}} of mammalian cell-mediated immune responsiveness {{is critically}} {{dependent upon the}} specialized maturational microenvironment of the thymus.

These <b>lymphoid</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> establish an intrinsic thymic pool of precursor cells with limited self-renewing potential; the lymphoid cells of the thymus are maintained throughout adult life due to a continual lowlevel seeding of the thymus by precursor cells of extrathymic (mostly bone marrow) origin (3).

40|$|Differences in the {{structure}} of the interphase nucleus between two species of birds, the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) and the chick (Gallus gallus) has been used to distinguish cells from different origins in interspecies combinations. This biological cell marking technique was applied to thymus histogenesis. Using various combinations between components of quail and chick thymic rudiments, the respective contribution of endodermal epithelium, mesenchyme, and blood-borne extrinsic elements to the histogenesis of thymus was analyzed. It was demonstrated that the whole lymphoid population of the thymus is derived from immigrant blood-borne <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> which are chemically attracted by the endoderm of the 3 rd and 4 th pharyngeal pouch. The latter is determined to differentiate into thymic epithelial reticulum as soon as the 15 -somite stage, and is able to attract blood <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> even when transplanted in an heterotopic position such as the ventral body wall of the embryo. It was shown that the thymic mesenchyme originates from the neural crest mesectoderm which colonizes early the 3 rd and 4 th branchial arches. It participates in the formation of perivascular mesenchyme, but does not give rise to lymphocytes. From heterospecific transplantations of quail thymuses into chick embryo (and inversely) at various stages of development is appeared that the thymic rudiment becomes attractive for <b>lymphoid</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> at a precise stage of its evolution for each species. The attractivity period lasts about 24 h for the quail and 36 h for the chick. Then, the inflow of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> becomes very low until the end of the incubation period.

5000|$|Lymphocytes {{are white}} blood cells that form from a blood <b>stem</b> <b>cell,</b> hemocytoblast, in bone marrow and travel {{to other parts of}} the body, {{normally}} specific lymphoid tissues, to mature.

Lutzner cells are an atypical form of T-cell lymphocytes and are normally CD4+. Lutzner cells develop because of clonal gene rearrangements in the T-cell receptor or antibody.

Although these assays vary in methodological detail, all use an i. v. route of cell transfer to study the ability of hemopoietic precursors to repopulate the thymus of irradiated recipients. These transfer systems have permitted significant progress in the identification, isolation, and characterization of prothymocytes and in the general analysis of thymocytopoiesis (e. g., 7 - 10). However, the i. v. transfer systems have several properties that limit their usefulness for detailed studies of thymocyte development.

Similarly, deoxyadenosine and adenosine excretion were both markedly diminished compared to that of untreated patients but deoxyadenosine excretion was still clearly increased (20. 1 and 38. 6 vs. normal of less than 0. 2 nmol/mg creatinine) while adenosine excretion was in the upper range of normal (7. 0 and 8. 1 vs. normal of 5. 6 +/- 3. 6 nmol/mg creatinine). Mononuclear cell deoxy ATP content was also elevated compared to normal (5. 25 and 14. 4 vs. 1. 2 +/- 0. 3).

With median follow-up of 39. 1 months, event free survival and overall survival were 60. 4 % and 67. 5 %, respectively, at 5 yr. Events included relapse in 10 and treatment-related mortality (TRM) in 10. The causes of TRM included sepsis in 4, GVHD in 4 (1 acute GVHD and 3 chronic GVHD), veno-occlusive disease in 1 and fulminant hepatitis in 1. Patients transplanted with CB had event free survival of 57. 1 %, comparable to 63. 2 % for those transplanted with other than CB. In conclusion, HCT with unrelated donors is effective treatment modality for children with acute leukemia. In children with acute leukemia candidate for HCT but lack suitable sibling donor, unrelated HCT may be a possible treatment option at the adequate time of their disease...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} reported {{the structure of}} a chromatin remodeling complex (PYR complex) with Ikaros as its DNA binding subunit that is specifically present in adult murine and human hematopoietic cells. We now show that homozygous Ikaros “knockout” (null) mice lack the PYR complex, demonstrating the requirement for Ikaros {{in the formation of the}} complex on DNA. Heterozygous Ikaros null mice have about half as much PYR complex, indicating a dosage effect for both Ikaros and PYR complex. We also show that Ikaros null mice have multiple hematopoietic cell defects including anemia and megakaryocytic abnormalities, in addition to previously reported <b>lymphoid</b> and <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> defects. The null mice also have a delay in murine embryonic to adult β-globin switching and a delay in human γ to β switching, consistent with a previously suggested role for PYR complex in this process. Lastly, cDNA array analyses indicate that several hematopoietic cell-specific genes in all blood lineages are either up- or down-regulated in 14 -day embryos from Ikaros null as compared with wild-type mice. These results indicate that Ikaros and PYR complex function together in vivo at many adult hematopoietic cell-specific genes and at intergenic sites, affecting their expression and leading to pleiotropic hematopoietic defects...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWhile the {{envelope}} glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) {{is widely used}} for pseudotyping of lentiviral vectors, sub-optimal gene transfer into certain cell types and its sensitivity to inactivation by human complement hinders its broader applications. To find alternative candidates, here we evaluated two serologically distinct novel viral envelopes derived from Chandipura (CNV-G) and Piry (PRV-G) vesiculoviruses. Both permitted generation of high titer psuedotyped lentiviral vectors with a capacity for high efficiency gene transfer into various cell types from different species. In human <b>lymphoid</b> and hematopoietic <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> their transduction efficiency was significantly {{lower than that of}} VSV-G. However, both novel envelopes were found to be more resistant to inactivation by human serum complement compared to VSV-G. Thus CNV-G and PRV-G envelopes can be harnessed for multiple uses in the future based on the cell type that needs to be gene transduced and possibly for in vivo gene transfer...|$|R
40|$|Infection {{of humans}} with {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) frequently results in suppression of hematopoiesis; {{in some cases}} this may lead to severe bone marrow failure. The mechanism whereby HBV infection affects hematopoiesis is unknown. In vitro exposure of human bone marrow to HBV results in a dose-dependent inhibition of erythroid (erythroid burst forming units, BFU-E; erythroid colony-forming units CFU-E), myeloid (colony-forming units-granulocyte macrophage CFU-GM), and <b>lymphoid</b> (CFU-[T-lymphocytic]-TL) hematopoietic <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> Inactivation or immunoabsorption of HBV from sera resulted in loss of HBV-induced inhibition of hematopoietic <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> De novo gamma interferon was not detectable in the supernatants of cultures of bone marrow cells with HBV. Antibodies to gamma interferon {{did not affect the}} suppression of hematopoietic <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> by HBV. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was detected by immune electron microscopy in nuclei of greater than 70 % of immature hematopoietic cells including myeloblasts, normoblasts, and lymphoblasts; granulocytes had mostly cytoplasmic HBsAg. Hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBcAg) was also detected in about 5 % of HBV infected bone marrow cells by immunoperoxidase staining. These data indicate that HBV can infect hematopoietic cells and their progenitors, thus suggesting a wider range of tropism for HBV than previously reported. These results may provide a basis to study HBV infection in vitro, and the effects of HBV on hematopoiesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{ability of}} various precursors to generate functional B cells in vivo {{was assessed by}} transferring normal, chromosomally-marked CBA/H-T 6 T 6 cells to irradiated or unirradiated immunodeficient CBA/N mice. Emergence of donor-derived B cells was monitored {{by means of a}} B- cell cloning assay (in which CBA/N cells are inactive), and by karyotpic analysis of <b>lymphoid,</b> myeloid, and <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> metaphases. Grafts of lymph node, spleen, anti-mu surface immunoglobin suppressed bone marrow, sIg+ cell-depleted marrow, normal marrow, fetal liver, and yolk sac suggest: (a) there is little self-renewal of sIg+ B cells in these models; (b) pre-committed cells have extensive proliferative/differentiative potential and at least initially contribute most of the newly-formed B cells; (c) populations or pre-B cells obtained from various sources differ in their regenerative ability; (d) CBA/N mice are deficient in a category of pre-B cells which are found in fetal liver; and (e) selective B-cell chimerism results from grafting of unirradiated CBA/N mice...|$|R
40|$|The {{selective}} in vitro generation of rat, mouse, and human terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-positive (TdT lymphoid cells in our long-term xenogeneic bone marrow (BM) culture system {{is characterized by}} physical interaction between the developing lymphocytes and mouse BM-adherent stromal cells and macrophages. In the present study, experiments in which micropor) us membrane culture inserts were inoculated with rat BM cells demonstrated that although the generation of primitive B-lineage lymphoid cells requires {{the presence of a}} mouse BM feeder layer, cognitive recognition events are not necessary. Similarly, cell-free (and serum-free) medium conditioned with mouse BM (but not thymus or spleen) adherent cells and stromal-cell lines therefrom supported the proliferation of early rat lymphoid cells in a dose-dependent manner. Double immunofluorescence for incorporated bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and early B-lineage markers of rat BM lymphoid cells maintained in culture inserts or conditioned medium (CM), and studies of their in vitro and in vivo developmental potentials, indicated that the lymphoproliferative response resulted from the selective stimulation of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>stem</b> and/or progenitor <b>cells.</b> The most primitive of these target cells had a HIS 24 HIS 50 - TdT- c/- sIg-, pre-pro-B-cell phenotype...|$|R
40|$|It {{is still}} {{debatable}} whether the various isolates of murine leukemia-inducing viruses (MuLV) I represent distinct viruses, isolates from different {{sources of the}} same virus, or closely related variants. The studies of Gross (1), designed to compare these viruses {{in terms of their}} morphology, chemical stability, and pathogenicity, failed to reveal significant differences. Electron microscopic observations have shown that all MuLV isolates are enveloped, "C-type " particles (1, 2). In addition, these particles are uniformly susceptible to mild ether treatment (1, 3), share a common internal group-specific antigen (4, 5), and are capable of inducing a wide spectrum of leukemias, namely <b>lymphoid,</b> myeloid, or <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> leukemias among different susceptible mouse strains (1, 6). Only the MuLV strains isolated by Friend (7) and Rauscher (8) consistently induce a particular type of leukemia, an erythroleukemia, in all susceptible mouse strains. The capacity of these virus isolates to rapidly induce erythroleukemia is thought to be a property of spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV), which is regularly accompanied by a lymphatic leukemia-inducing helper virus (LLV-F or LLV-R) in the Friend or Rauscher virus complex, respectively (9) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} the culturing and {{propagation}} of ovine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) in vitro is described. Bone marrow cells from sterna of freshly slaughtered sheep were cultured in hydrophobic (teflon foil) {{bags in the}} presence of high serum concentrations (20 % autologous serum and 20 % fetal calf serum). During an 18 day culture period in the absence of added conditioned medium, and without medium change, a strong enrichment of mononuclear phagocytes was achieved. Whereas the number of macrophages increased four to fivefold during this time, granulocytes, <b>lymphoid</b> <b>cells,</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and undifferentiated progenitor cells were reduced to less than 3 % of their numbers at Day 0. This resulted in BMM populations of 94 +/- 3 % purity. These cells had morphological and histochemical characteristics of differentiated macrophages, and they performed functions similar to those of non-activated, unprimed human monocyte-derived macrophages. Thus, they avidly ingested erythrocytes coated with IgG of heterologous or homologous origin. They expressed a modest level of procoagulant activity, but upon triggering with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a marked increase in cell-associated procoagulant activity was observed. LPS triggering promoted the secretion of interleukin- 1, as evidenced by measurement of murine thymocyte costimulatory activity, and transforming growth factor-beta. Using the mouse L 929 cell cytotoxicity assay as an indication of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activity, no TNF activity was detected in the same supernatants, a result possibly due to species restriction. BMM generated low levels of O 2 - upon triggering with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA). On the other hand, no O 2 - production was observed upon stimulation with zymosan opsonized with ovine or human serum. Using luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (CL) as a more sensitive indicator of an oxidative burst, both PMA or zymosan were able to trigger CL, but the response was subject to partial inhibition by sodium azide, an inhibitor of myeloperoxidase. This points to non-macrophage cells contributing also to the CL response, and is consistent with the view that unprimed BMM elicit a low oxidative burst upon triggering with strong inducers of a burst. Our functional characterization now allows us to apply priming and activation protocols and to relate their effect to functional alterations...|$|R
40|$|The {{leucocyte}} {{adhesion molecule}} LFA- 1 (CD 11 a/CD 18) and its counter structure ICAM- 1 (CD 54) play {{a pivotal role}} in cell-cell interactions in the immune system and hence their expression on malignant cells might {{play an important role in}} determining the biological behavior of lymphoid malignancies. This study examined the LFA- 1 (CD 11 a/CD 18) and ICAM- 1 (CD 54) expression profiles of a large series of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL, n = 220) and lymphoid leukemias (LL, n = 48), which, by their differentiation-antigen phenotype represented essentially all stages of <b>lymphoid</b> development from <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> to mature activated T- and B-lymphocyte. It was found that NHL and LL differentially express LFA- 1 and ICAM- 1 molecules according to their lineage derivation, stage of differentiation, and growth pattern. Specifically: (a) T-cell neoplasms nearly always express LFA- 1 whereas B-cell tumors are often LFA- 1 low/negative; (b) ICAM- 1 expression is largely confined to tumors with a mature or activated T- or B-cell phenotype; (c) neoplasms with a leukemic dissemination pattern are either ICAM- 1 low or negative. Importantly, neither LFA- 1 nor ICAM- 1 expression was related to tumor grad...|$|R
