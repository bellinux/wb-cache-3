The characteristics were measured at different processing times. Three batches of dry-cured <b>lamb</b> <b>legs</b> (nine legs per batch) were prepared with no-, short- and long-tumbling treatments, and microbial counts, NaCl, aw, proximate composition, pH, free fatty acids, water soluble nitrogen, volatile compounds, texture and colour were evaluated at days 1, 22 and 71 of processing. Furthermore, a descriptive sensory analysis (flavour and texture) was performed in the final product (day 71). Time-related changes were observed for most of the characteristics studied. The effect of tumbling was only observed for the sensory attribute pastiness that was higher in tumbled legs. Methyl-branched butanal was only detected in tumbled legs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|On {{completion}} of all sonications in each <b>lamb</b> <b>leg,</b> three-dimensional gradient-echo T 1 -weighted images were re-acquired {{to assess the}} conspicuity of any thermal lesions that had been generated. An echo time of 2.3 ms and flip angle of 20 o were selected to maximise contrast between lesions and normal tissue, based on the expected T 1 values of muscle tissue at 3 T [22]. In addition, for maximum potential lesion conspicuity, {{an attempt was made}} to generate large thermal lesions in <b>lamb</b> <b>leg</b> number 8 by doubly sonicating two 4  mm cells at 160 W and by sonicating two 8  mm cells at 160 W and 200 W, achieved by operating the Sonalleve in uterine-mode, rather than bone-mode. After sonications, DWI and T 1 -weighted sequences were acquired. In addition, T 1 -weighted fat suppressed volume interpolated and T 2 -weighted images with and without fat suppression were obtained. In each case, parameters were selected to maximise image contrast between thermal lesions and un-sonicated regions, e.g. using a short echo time of 40 – 60 ms in the T 2 -weighted sequences, for an expected muscle T 2 value of approximately 50 ms [22].|$|R
30|$|After each sonication, the DWI {{sequence}} {{was acquired}} five more times at approximately 4  min intervals. The first was {{immediately after the}} mandatory thermal cooling monitoring period and the last approximately 20 min after sonication. The process was repeated for every sonication in each <b>lamb</b> <b>leg</b> during each imaging session. As the DWI sequence was a multi-slice acquisition, DWI acquired after sonications delivered {{towards the end of}} imaging sessions also provided delayed data up to 2 h after some of the earlier exposures, if they were included within the field of view.|$|R
30|$|As ADC is {{temperature}} dependent [21], it {{was important}} to understand the temperature behaviour of the ex-vivo <b>lamb</b> <b>leg</b> samples before and after sonication. Room temperature was measured using a standard alcohol thermometer. All other temperature measurements were made from a PRFS thermometry sequence using an echo planar imaging (EPI) accelerated, multi-slice two-dimensional gradient-echo T 1 -weighted sequence, acquired as a dynamic series (repetition time 25 ms, echo time 16 ms, flip angle 18 o, EPI factor 11, fat suppression ProSet, number of signal averages 2, voxel size 2.1 × 2.1 × 7.0 mm 3, field of view 400 × 300 mm 2, dynamic scan time 3 s). Data were obtained from three 7  mm thick slices automatically placed orthogonally through the treatment focus. In <b>lamb</b> <b>leg</b> number 1, six separate 1 min acquisitions of PRFS data (23 dynamics) were first performed in each of three separate cortical locations to determine the stability and accuracy of the PRFS predicted temperature. This was compared to the measured room/lamb leg temperature. The same sequence was then acquired before, during, and after sonication of a 4 and 12  mm cell at the maximum power permissible at each cell size (190 W for the 4  mm cell, 80 W for the 12  mm cell). Data were obtained for the maximum cooling period for which temperature data were available.|$|R

30|$|Ex-vivo <b>lamb</b> <b>legs</b> {{were used}} in this study because they {{represented}} a reasonable model without resorting to in-vivo animal models and allowed for macroscopic inspection of sliced tissues after exposure. The model was not ideal because there was no active perfusion, and samples were not at a physiological temperature. In vivo, it is likely that perfusion would contribute substantially to tissue cooling. The dissipation of heat may mean that the relationship between thermal dose, ADC, and tissue damage is influenced by local blood supply [27]. We are therefore extending the current work by evaluating the repeatability, temporal evolution, and permanence of ADC changes during MR-guided HIFU treatments for palliating pain from bone metastases in patients recruited to a clinical study [28] at our institution.|$|R

The study aimed to assess the pleiotropic QTL effects on key meat quality traits (toughness and intramuscular fat content after 7 days aging) of crossbred lambs carrying one copy of the TM-QTL. The results showed that male Texel ? Mule lambs carrying the TM-QTL had significantly less intramuscular fat (1. 86 % versus 2. 25 %) and higher toughness, with increased variation, in the loin muscle, compared to non-carrier males. Similar conclusions were obtained using {{two different types of}} tenderometer equipment: one using the Volodkevitch test (average shear force of 4. 17 kgF or 40. 9 N for carrier males, 2. 61 kgF or 25. 6 N for non-carrier males) and one using the MIRINZ test (average shear force of 6. 18 kgF or 60. 6 N for carrier males, 5. 22 kgF or 51. 2 N for non-carrier males).

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{bachelor}} thesis was to determine content of biologically active biogenic amines and polyamines in mutton and lamb meat. There are not too many consumers of mutton in the Czech Republic. This kind of meat is consumed mostly during Easter, while in Anglo-Saxon countries {{it has been a}} sought-after food resource. Worlds mutton yearly consumption has been about 2 kg per capita. In the Czech Republic it is only 0. 4 kg. Meat of slaughter animals is rich in biogenic amines and polyamines, especially in spermine (SPM) and spermidine (SPD). Their contents in beef, pork and chicken meat have been determined previously. Literature data on mutton and lamb has been lacking for polyamines and information on biogenic amines has been very scarce. Liquid chromatography method in UPLC arrangement was used for the determination of putrescine (PUT), cadaverine (CAD), tyramine (TYR), phenylethylamine (PEA), histamine (HIM), tryptamine (TRM), SPD and SPM, the amines with considerable biological effects. Mutton and lamb loin (19 and 20, respectively) and leg (17 and 20, respectively) were analysed 24 hours after slaughter The samples originated from various minor breeders and they were hybrids of several breeds.

Crossbred lambs born out of Mule ewes mated to heterozygous Texel sires for the TM-QTL were evaluated {{for a range of}} carcass traits. Lambs were genotyped and classified as carriers (n = 62) of a single copy of the TM-QTL and non-carriers (n = 49). In this study, the effects of the TM-QTL on carcass attributes were investigated using subjective classification scores for conformation and fatness, and measurements from a video image analysis (VIA) system. In addition, refined prediction equations to estimate weights of primal joints (<b>leg,</b> <b>chump,</b> loin, breast and shoulder) were obtained by calibrating the VIA system against computer tomography (CT) measurements in the loin region. The new refined prediction models increased the accuracy of prediction of all primal cuts on an average of 16 % compared to previously derived standard VIA prediction equations. The coefficient of determination (R 2) of the VIA system to predict in vivo CT measurements ranged from 0. 39 to 0. 72 for measurements of Musculus longissimus lumborum (MLL) area, width and depth, lumbar spine length, loin muscle volume and loin muscularity index. Using VIA estimates of CT-measured loin muscle traits, a significant increase in depth (+ 2. 7 %) of the MLL was found {{to be associated with the}} TM-QTL. Conformation and fatness scores and the shape of the carcass measured as individual lengths, widths and areas by VIA were not significantly influenced by the TM-QTL. Primal meat yields estimated using both standard and refined VIA prediction equations were not significantly affected by the TM-QTL. However, carcass ?compactness? was found to have significantly increased in carrier lambs. The weight of the dissected MLL estimated using VIA information was greater (+ 2. 6 %) for carriers compared to non-carriers. To conclude, neither the current industry carcass evaluation system for conformation and fatness nor the standard VIA system is able to identify the effect of the TM-QTL in the loin region in the moment. However, the calibration of the VIA system against CT measurements resulted in improved VIA prediction equations for primal meat yields and also showed moderate potential to estimate loin muscle traits measured by CT and to detect, partially, the effect of the TM-QTL on these traits.
