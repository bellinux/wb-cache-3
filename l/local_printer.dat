25|$|Quintana became Charles V's confessor in 1530, and Servetus {{joined him}} in the {{imperial}} retinue as his page or secretary. Servetus travelled through Italy and Germany, and attended Charles' coronation as Holy Roman Emperor in Bologna. He was outraged by the pomp and luxury displayed by the Pope and his retinue, and decided to follow the path of reformation. It is not known when Servetus left the imperial entourage, but in October 1530 he visited Johannes Oecolampadius in Basel, staying there for about ten months, and probably supporting himself as a proofreader for a <b>local</b> <b>printer.</b> By {{this time he was}} already spreading his theological beliefs. In May 1531 he met Martin Bucer and Wolfgang Fabricius Capito in Strasbourg.|$|E
25|$|Hall's history, {{entitled}} A History of the Town and Parish of Nantwich, or Wich-Malbank, in the County Palatine of Chester {{but usually}} {{referred to as}} Hall's History of Nantwich, was completed in December 1883. The first edition of 350 copies was financed by subscription; it was privately printed by <b>local</b> <b>printer</b> Thomas Johnson, bound by Macmillan and Co. in Manchester and distributed early in 1884. Nearly four times the length of Platt's work, it covers the period from the Domesday survey of 1086 to the date of publication, and additionally includes the nearby townships of Alvaston (now part of Worleston), Willaston and Woolstanwood. There are 29 line illustrations, {{some of which are}} not credited and might have been drawn by the author.|$|E
25|$|From 1950 to 1957, Tordoff was {{a faculty}} member at the University of Kansas and a {{researcher}} at Kansas' Natural History Museum. While at Kansas, he collaborated with a number of other ornithologists, including Mengel, Glen Woolfenden, and Norman A. Ford; together, they are said to have raised standards for ornithological museum work. Tordoff edited The Wilson Bulletin, the journal of the Wilson Ornithological Society, from 1952 to 1954. During that time, he convinced a <b>local</b> <b>printer,</b> Ayle Allen, to print the journal, and their collaboration eventually grew into Allen Press, a prominent publisher of scientific journals and books. In 1957 Tordoff moved his family back to Ann Arbor where he replaced Van Tyne as {{a faculty member}} at the University of Michigan, becoming curator of birds at the Museum of Zoology. There he advised a number of graduate students who went on to have distinguished careers, among them Frank Gill.|$|E

2500|$|In 1871, Milton Hershey {{left school}} {{for good and}} was apprenticed to a <b>local</b> <b>printer,</b> Sam Ernst, who {{published}} a German-English newspaper. He did not like {{that kind of work}} and he thought it was very boring. One day at work there, he accidentally dropped his hat in one of the machines. Because his boss was hot-tempered, he was fired shortly after. He was worried to see how his parents would react. His father asked Ernst to take him back, and he did decide to give him a second chance, but Mattie Snavely, his aunt, and his mother had a different idea. They wanted him to learn the trade of candy making instead. [...] So, his mother arranged for the 14-year-old Hershey to be apprenticed to a confectioner named Joseph Royer in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Over the next four years, Hershey learned the craft of creating confections. In 1876, he moved to Philadelphia to start his first confectionery business.|$|E
2500|$|As Burns {{lacked the}} funds {{to pay for his}} passage to the West Indies, Gavin Hamilton {{suggested}} that he should [...] "publish his poems in the mean time by subscription, as a likely way of getting a little money to provide him more liberally in necessaries for Jamaica." [...] On 3 April Burns sent proposals for publishing his Scotch Poems to John Wilson, a <b>local</b> <b>printer</b> in Kilmarnock, who published these proposals on 14 April 1786, {{on the same day that}} Jean Armour's father tore up the paper in which Burns attested his marriage to Jean. To obtain a certificate that he was a free bachelor, Burns agreed on 25 June to stand for rebuke in the Mauchline kirk for three Sundays. He transferred his share in Mossgiel farm to his brother Gilbert on 22 July, and on 30 July wrote to tell his friend John Richmond that, [...] "Armour has got a warrant to throw me in jail until I can find a warrant for an enormous sum...

25|$|As {{a result}} of all this, movable type was {{initially}} used by government offices which needed to produce large number of copies and by itinerant printers producing family registers who would carry perhaps 20,000 pieces of wooden type with them and cut any other characters needed locally.

2500|$|Emma Josephine Trigg (usually {{known only}} by her middle and last name) was the {{daughter}} of Albert Trigg, owner of the Brunswick Saloon in Great Falls. She became an art teacher in the Great Falls Public Schools, and in 1911 became the children's librarian at the Great Falls Public Library. Trigg later was briefly married to W.T. Ridgley, a <b>local</b> <b>printer</b> who published books of Russell's works as well as an autobiography of a local civic leader which Russell illustrated. The Brunswick Saloon was one of Russell's favorite bars, and Albert Trigg allowed Russell to use one of his back rooms as an art studio. In 1900, Russell built a two-story clapboard house near the Trigg home, and in 1903 built a log cabin studio on an empty lot between the two houses. Russell became acquainted with [...] "Miss Josephine" [...] (as he referred to her) when Trigg was a teenager, and they remained friends for the rest of Russell's life. Trigg often accompanied Russell and his wife on vacations, and she provided calligraphy for many of his letters, postcards, and illustrated items (such as place settings at dinner parties).|$|E
2500|$|On 30 September 1846, Morton {{administered}} {{diethyl ether}} to Eben Frost, {{a music teacher}} from Boston, for a dental extraction. Two weeks later, Morton became the first to publicly demonstrate the use of diethyl ether as a general anesthetic at Massachusetts General Hospital, in what is known today as the Ether Dome. On 16 October 1846, John Collins Warren removed a tumor from the neck of a <b>local</b> <b>printer,</b> Edward Gilbert Abbott. Upon completion of the procedure, Warren reportedly quipped, [...] "Gentlemen, this is no humbug." [...] News of this event rapidly traveled around the world. Robert Liston performed the first amputation in December of that year. Morton published his experience soon after. Harvard University professor Charles Thomas Jackson (1805–1880) later claimed that Morton stole his idea; Morton disagreed and a lifelong dispute began. For many years, Morton was credited as being the pioneer of general anesthesia in the Western hemisphere, {{despite the fact that}} his demonstration occurred four years after Long's initial experience. Long later petitioned William Crosby Dawson (1798–1856), a United States Senator from Georgia at that time, to support his claim {{on the floor of the}} United States Senate as the first to use ether anesthesia.|$|E
6000|$|... "What?" [...] he said. [...] "To {{have planned}} {{out the whole}} thing? For {{carrying}} it out was mere child's play. He had twenty-four hours in which to put his plan into execution.

That, of course, is done 'while you wait.' Beyond that there was the purchase of a good second-hand uniform, fur coat, and a beard and a wig from a costumier's.|$|E

Hitherto Mrs. Maumbry, in fashionable walking clothes, had usually been her husband's companion; but this was less frequent now. The close and singular friendship between the two men went on for nearly a year, when Mr. Sainway was presented to a living in a densely-populated town in the midland counties. He bade the parishioners of his old place a reluctant farewell and departed, the touching sermon he preached on the occasion being published by the <b>local</b> <b>printer.</b> Everybody was sorry to lose him; and it was with genuine grief that his Casterbridge congregation learnt later on that soon after his induction to his benefice, during some bitter weather, he had fallen seriously ill of inflammation of the lungs, of which he eventually died.|$|E
6000|$|This vein {{of cynicism}} was not characteristic, {{as it would}} have been in an older man; it might have been part of that spiritual and {{intellectual}} unruliness of youth, which people laugh at and forgive, and which one generally regards in after life as something almost alien to one's self. He wrote long, bragging articles about Equity, in a tone bordering on burlesque, and he had a department in his paper where he printed humorous squibs of his own and of other people; these were sometimes copied, and in the daily papers of the State he had been mentioned as [...] "the funny man of the Equity Free Press." [...] He also sent letters to one of the Boston journals, which he reproduced in his own sheet, and which gave him an importance that the best endeavor as a country editor would never have won him with the villagers. He would naturally, as the <b>local</b> <b>printer,</b> have ranked a little above the foreman of the saw-mill in the social scale, and decidedly below the master of the Academy; but his personal qualities elevated him over the head even of the latter. But above all, {{the fact that he was}} studying law was a guaranty of his superiority that nothing else could have given; that science is the fountain of the highest distinction in a country town. Bartley's whole course implied that he was above editing the Free Press, but that he did it because it served his turn. That was admirable.|$|E
