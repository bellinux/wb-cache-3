30|$|Besides {{the three}} {{procedural}} classes, we {{will focus on}} four outcomes that can occur in these types of cases: <b>lawsuit</b> accepted, <b>lawsuit</b> partially accepted, <b>lawsuit</b> dismissed and <b>lawsuit</b> settled. <b>Lawsuit</b> accepted occurs when the judge upholds the request, accepts {{the request of the}} plaintiff and the plaintiff receives what was requested. <b>Lawsuit</b> partially accepted occurs when the judge makes a decision giving partial gains to the plaintif—the plaintiff wins the suits but not the full amount requested. <b>Lawsuit</b> dismissed occurs when the trial of the case is unfavorable to the plaintif—the judge makes a decision in favor of the defendant and not of the plaintiff (e.g., the plaintiff’s request was unfounded). Last, when the two parties make an agreement and the judge approves it, there is a settlement of the case [10].|$|R

5|$|After the Act's initial {{success in}} combating tactics {{designed}} to deny minorities {{access to the}} polls, the Act became predominately used {{as a tool to}} challenge racial vote dilution. Starting in the 1970s, the Attorney General commonly raised Section 5 objections to voting changes that decreased the effectiveness of racial minorities' votes, including discriminatory annexations, redistricting plans, and election methods such as at-large election systems, runoff election requirements, and prohibitions on bullet voting. In total, 81% (2,541) of preclearance objections made between 1965 and 2006 were based on vote dilution. Claims brought under Section 2 have also predominately concerned vote dilution. Between the 1982 creation of the Section 2 results test and 2006, at least 331 Section 2 <b>lawsuits</b> resulted in published judicial opinions. In the 1980s, 60% of Section 2 <b>lawsuits</b> challenged at-large election systems; in the 1990s, 37.2% challenged at-large election systems and 38.5% challenged redistricting plans. Overall, plaintiffs succeeded in 37.2% of the 331 <b>lawsuits,</b> and {{they were more likely to}} succeed in <b>lawsuits</b> brought against covered jurisdictions.|$|E

40|$|Civil <b>lawsuit</b> {{on medical}} {{liability}} could be conducted through two legal actions, namely <b>lawsuit</b> based on {{breach of contract}} and <b>lawsuit</b> based on tort.

5|$|Stossel {{has criticized}} {{government}} programs for being inefficient, wasteful, and harmful. He has also criticized the American legal system, opining {{that it provides}} lawyers and vexatious litigators the incentive to file frivolous <b>lawsuits</b> indiscriminately. Stossel contends that these suits often generate more wealth for lawyers than for deserving clients, stifle innovation and personal freedoms, and cause harm to private citizens, taxpayers, consumers and businesses. Although Stossel concedes that some <b>lawsuits</b> are {{necessary in order to}} provide justice to people genuinely injured by others with greater economic power, he advocates the adoption in the U.S. of the English rule as one method to reduce the more abusive or frivolous <b>lawsuits.</b>|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of Extra Mile, a band from Kentucky {{threatened}} to sue Shenandoah {{over the use of}} the name Shenandoah. After a financial settlement was made with the Kentucky band, two other bands filed <b>lawsuits</b> over Shenandoah's name. The <b>lawsuits</b> depleted the money earned by the band on the road, which led to the band asking the label and their production company to all pay one-third of their legal costs. The production company refused, and Shenandoah was forced to filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early 1991 after paying more than 2 million dollars on court settlements and legal fees. Although the <b>lawsuits</b> allowed Shenandoah to keep its name, the bankruptcy filing terminated the contract with Columbia after a 1992 Greatest Hits package. The production company's officials then filed a lawsuit against the band, claiming that it had tried to void its agreement with them. After Shenandoah's departure, there were no other bands on Columbia's Nashville division; as a result, producer Larry Strickland assembled three musicians to create a new band called Matthews, Wright & King in an attempt to keep a commercially successful band on the label.|$|E
