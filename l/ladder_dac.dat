40|$|A general {{digital to analog}} {{converter}} (DAC), which encompasses {{popularly known}} weighted resistor and R- 2 R ladder DACs as the special cases, is introduced. The weighted resistor sub-family has been studied in the recent past. This paper presents a detailed study of the sub-family of ladder DACs. Some DACs have one or more interesting features, such as, minimum number of resistors, minimum spread minimum total resistance, all equal-valued resistors. Ir {{is interesting to note that}} the R- 2 R <b>ladder</b> <b>DAC</b> when realized,vith all equal valued resistors not only has the least possible spread but also has the minimum total resistance. Also there is another DAC which has the same spread of 2 as R- 2 R <b>ladder</b> <b>DAC</b> brit requires the minimum number of resistors...|$|E

50|$|There exist {{multiple}} {{versions of}} the C64DTV. DTV1 (NTSC television type) comes with 2 MB ROM. It first appeared in late 2004 for the American/Canadian market. DTV2 (called C64D2TV sometimes) is a revised version for the European and world markets (PAL television type) and appeared in late 2005. The ROM {{has been replaced by}} flash memory in these devices. However, the DTV2/PAL version suffers from a manufacturing fault, which results in poor colour rendering (the resistors in the R-2R <b>ladder</b> <b>DACs</b> for both the chroma and the luma have been transposed). In the DTV3, a problem with the blitter was fixed.|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} the linear R- 2 R <b>ladder</b> digital-to-analog {{converter}} (<b>DAC)</b> is developed {{in terms of the}} ratios of the effective resistances at the nodes of the ladder. This formulation demonstrates clearly why an infinite number of different sets of resistors can produce the same linearity error and shows how this error can be reduced by trimming. The relationship between the weights of the bits and the resistor ratios suggests appropriate trimming, design, and test strategie...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Interpolating, dual {{resistor}} ladder digital-to-analog converters (DACs) typically use the fine, {{least significant bit}} (LSB) ladder floating {{upon the}} static most significant bit (MSB) ladder. The usage of the LSB ladder incurs a penalty in dynamic performance due to the added output resistance and switch matrix parasitic capacitance. Current biasing of the LSB ladder addresses this issue by employing active circuitry. We propose an inverted <b>ladder</b> <b>DAC,</b> where an MSB ladder slides upon two static LSB ladders. While using no active components this scheme achieves lower output resistance and parasitic capacitance for a given power budget. We present a 0. 35 - m, 3. 3 -V implementation consuming 22 - A current with output resistance of 40 k and effective parasitic capacitance of 650 fF.

40|$|This work {{involves}} {{the development of}} digital calibration techniques for Analogto- Digital Converters. According to the 2001 International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors, improved ADC technology is {{a key factor in}} the development of present and future applications. The switched-capacitor (SC) pipeline technique is the most popular method of implementing moderate resolution ADCs. However the advantages of CMOS, which originally made SC circuits feasible, are being eroding by process scaling. Good switches and opamps are becoming increasingly difficult to design and the growing gate leakage of deep submicron MOSFETs is causing difficulty. Traditional ADC schemes do not work well with supply voltages of 1. 8 V and below. Furthermore, the performance required by present and future wireless and IT applications will not be met by the present day ADC circuits techniques. Bearing in mind the challenges associated with deep sub-micron analog circuitry a new calibration technique for folding ADCs has been developed. Since digital circuitry scales well, this calibration relies heavily on digital techniques. Hence it reduces the amount of analog design involved. As this folding ADC is dominated, in terms of both functionality and power, by digital circuitry, the performance of folding will improve when implemented in smaller geometry processes. An 8 -bit, 500 MS/s, digitally calibrated folding ADC was designed in TSMC 0. 18 mm. A second prototype, 9 -bit 400 MS/s, was designed in ST 90 nm. This ADC uses novel folders to reduce thermal noise. The major accomplishments of this work are: · The creation of a new folding ADC architecture that is digitally dominated allowing large transistor mismatch to be tolerated so that small devices can be utilized in the signal path. · The development of modeling techniques, to investigate and analyze the effects of transistor mismatch, folder linearity and redundancy in ADCs. · The design of a new folder circuit topology that decreases the required power consumption for a given noise budget. · The design of a resistor <b>ladder</b> <b>DAC</b> that uses a unique resistor layout to allow any shape ladder to be designed...|$|E
