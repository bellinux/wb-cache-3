5|$|The Leonhard Euler Telescope at <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> Observatory in Chile {{was used}} {{to follow up on}} the {{discovery}} circling WASP-44, searching for a point at which the planet transited, or crossed in front of, its host star. One transit was detected.|$|E
5|$|A team {{of astronomers}} led by Stéphane Udry of the Geneva Observatory used the HARPS {{instrument}} on the European Southern Observatory 3.6 meter telescope in <b>La</b> <b>Silla,</b> Chile, {{to discover the}} planet in 2007. Udry's team employed the radial velocity technique, in which the mass of a planet is determined based on the small perturbations it induces in its parent star’s orbit via gravity.|$|E
5|$|Follow-up {{observations}} {{were conducted by}} a European and American science team at the 1.2m Leonhard Euler Telescope at <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> Observatory in Chile, which further {{raised the possibility of}} the existence of a planet in WASP-15's orbit; use of the CORALIE spectrograph on the Euler Telescope between March 6, 2008 and July 17, 2008 revealed that the variations in radial velocity measurements were not because of an eclipsing binary star system.|$|E
5|$|HD 154672 b {{was later}} {{observed}} {{by a different}} team of astronomers investigating the role of metallicity, or the amount of metal present in a star, {{in the formation of}} planets. Six radial velocity measurements of the host star, collected using the HARPS instrument at Chile's <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> Observatory. The team used the radial velocity data to refine the parameters of HD 154672 b from what was published in its discovery paper a year earlier.|$|E
5|$|Later {{observation}} by both SuperWASPs in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres led to {{the collection}} of 13,768 data points between January and May 2010 and {{to the use of}} the CORALIE spectrograph at <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> Observatory in Chile. Fourteen measurements using the radial velocity method confirmed WASP-43b as a planet, revealing its mass in the process. The use of La Silla's TRAPPIST telescope helped the science team working on the planet to create a light curve of the planet's transit in December 2010.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{interpreted}} that a 0.81-day {{orbit of}} a possible planet from the data, and followed up with observations using the CORALIE spectrograph on the Leonhard Euler Telescope at Chile's <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> Observatory. CORALIE provided radial velocity measurements that indicated that WASP-43 was being transited by a planet that was 1.8 times Jupiter's mass, now dubbed WASP-43b. Another follow-up using the TRAPPIST telescope further defined the light curve of the body transiting WASP-43.|$|E
5|$|The highest 24-hour {{rainfall}} {{reports were}} 214.9mm (8.46in) in Tamuin, San Luis Potosí, and 185.2mm (7.29in) in Tamesi, Tamaulipas. In Veracruz, the highest precipitation reading associated with Gert was 117mm, (4.61in) in El Higo. However, damage overall was minimal, amounting to $6million (2005USD, $60million 2005 MXN), {{and there was}} only one reported fatality, from a man who was carried away by the <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> River when he was pushing a stalled car across the flooded stream.|$|E
5|$|WASP-43b is a transiting {{planet in}} orbit around the young, active, and low-mass star WASP-43 in the {{constellation}} Sextans. The planet is a Hot Jupiter with a mass twice that of Jupiter, but with a roughly equal radius. WASP-43b was flagged as a candidate by the SuperWASP program before they conducted follow-ups using instruments at <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> Observatory in Chile, which confirmed its existence and provided orbital and physical characteristics. The planet's discovery was published on April 14, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Data {{processing}} led to {{the acquisition}} of 24,943 data points that suggested that some body transited, or crossed in front of (and briefly dimmed), WASP-15 every 3.7520 days. Approximately eleven transits, full and partial, were observed. Use of the EulerCAM photometer at the <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> Observatory's 1.2 m Leonhard Euler Telescope on March 29, 2008 provided further evidence for an exoplanet by better defining the transit's curve. Later, the CORALIE spectrograph (also on the Euler telescope) between March 6, 2008 and July 17, 2008 used Doppler spectroscopy to collect 21 radial velocity measurements. Analysis confirmed {{the presence of a}} planet that was later designated WASP-15b.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 3634 b {{was one of}} {{a sample}} of over 300 very-low-mass stars {{targeted}} by astronomers in search of planets that may orbit such stars. Using the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) at <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> Observatory in Chile, six years of radial velocity data led the astronomers in the discovery of eleven other planets. After these discoveries, the astronomers chose to refocus their search on short-period planets, hoping to follow up after discoveries using the radial velocity method with a search for planets that also transited, or crossed in front of, their host stars as seen from Earth.|$|E
5|$|GJ 3634 {{is named}} for its {{location}} in the Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars; a later expansion of the original catalogue was compiled jointly by Gliese and Hartmut Jahreiß. The Third Catalogue, the most recent catalogue, was formed to tag all then-known stars within 25 parsecs of Earth (81.54 light years). GJ 3634 was first catalogued in 1987. The discoverers of GJ 3634 b worked through the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) at the European Southern Observatory's <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> Observatory in Chile for over six years in search of planets that orbited low-mass red dwarfs. After the discoveries of eleven prior planets, the researchers changed their strategy to search for planets with extremely short orbits. They would first discover the system using the radial velocity method, in which an observed Doppler shift in the star's light would be measured and interpreted; and would then follow up with a search for transits, in which the planet crosses in front of and dims its star as seen from Earth. Radial velocity measurements would help determine the most efficient and time-effective means of observing potential planetary transits.|$|E
25|$|About 300 {{reviewed}} publications annually are {{attributable to}} the work of the observatory. Discoveries made with <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> telescopes include the HARPS-spectrograph detection of the planets orbiting within the Gliese 581 planetary system, which contains the first known rocky planet in a habitable zone outside the solar system. Several telescopes at <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> played a role in linking gamma-ray bursts, the most energetic explosions in the universe since the Big Bang, with the explosions of massive stars. The ESO <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> Observatory also {{played a role in the}} study of supernova SN 1987A.|$|E
25|$|<b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> also hosts several {{national}} and project telescopes not operated by ESO. Among {{them are the}} Swiss Euler Telescope, the Danish National Telescope and the REM, TRAPPIST and TAROT telescopes.|$|E
25|$|The {{observatory}} hosts visitor instruments, {{attached to}} a telescope {{for the duration of}} an observational run and then removed. <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> also hosts national telescopes, such as the 1.2-metre Swiss and the 1.5-metre Danish telescopes.|$|E
25|$|Two {{independent}} research teams {{have shown that}} the universe's expansion is accelerating, based on exploding-star observations with astronomical telescopes at <b>La</b> <b>Silla.</b> The research teams were awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery.|$|E
25|$|Astronomers long {{suspected}} {{that a black}} hole exists {{at the center of}} the Milky Way, but their theory was unproven. Conclusive evidence was obtained after 16 years of monitoring the Galactic Center with ESO telescopes at the <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> and Paranal observatories.|$|E
25|$|After {{more than}} 1,000 nights of {{observation}} at <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> over a 15-year period, astronomers have determined {{the motion of}} more than 14,000 sunlike stars {{in the vicinity of}} the sun (demonstrating that the Milky Way is more turbulent and chaotic than previously thought).|$|E
25|$|The 1.54-metre Danish National Telescope {{was built}} by Grubb-Parsons {{and has been in}} use at <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> since 1979. The {{telescope}} has an off-axis mount, and the optics are a Ritchey-Chrétien design. Because of the telescope's mount and limited space inside the dome, it has significant pointing restrictions.|$|E
25|$|The Danish 1.54-metre {{telescope}} at <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> {{participated in the}} discovery {{of one of the}} most Earth-like planets found to date. The planet, detected using the microlensing technique and about five times as massive as Earth, circles its parent star in about 10 years and most certainly has a rocky and icy surface.|$|E
25|$|The 2.2-metre {{telescope}} {{has been}} in operation at <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> since early 1984, and is on indefinite loan to ESO from the Max Planck Society (Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften, or MPG, in German). Telescope time is shared between MPG and ESO observing programmes, while operation and maintenance of the telescope are ESO's responsibility.|$|E
25|$|The first-ever direct {{detection}} {{of the spectrum}} of visible light reflected from an exoplanet was made in 2015 by an international team of astronomers. The astronomers studied light from 51 Pegasi b – the first exoplanet discovered orbiting a main-sequence star (a Sunlike star), using the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) instrument at the European Southern Observatory's <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> Observatory in Chile.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 2000s, a second {{generation}} of planet-hunting spectrographs permitted far more precise measurements. The HARPS spectrograph, installed at the <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> Observatory in Chile in 2003, can identify radial-velocity shifts as small as 0.3m/s, enough to locate many rocky, Earth-like planets. A third generation of spectrographs is expected to come online in 2017. With measurement errors estimated below 0.1m/s, these new instruments would allow an extraterrestrial observer to detect even Earth.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, {{the first}} ESO {{telescope}} at the <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> site in Chile began operating. Because CERN (like ESO) had sophisticated instrumentation, the astronomy organisation frequently {{turned to the}} nuclear-research body for advice and a collaborative agreement between ESO and CERN was signed in 1970. Several months later, ESO's telescope division moved into a CERN building in Geneva and ESO's Sky Atlas Laboratory was established on CERN property. ESO's European departments moved into the new ESO headquarters in Garching (near Munich), Germany in 1980.|$|E
25|$|The {{speed of}} the star around the system's center of mass is much smaller {{than that of the}} planet, because the radius of its orbit around the center of mass is so small. (For example, the Sun moves by about 13m/s due to Jupiter, but only about 9cm/s due to Earth). However, {{velocity}} variations down to 1m/s or even somewhat less can be detected with modern spectrometers, such as the HARPS (High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher) spectrometer at the ESO 3.6 meter telescope in <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> Observatory, Chile, or the HIRES spectrometer at the Keck telescopes.|$|E
25|$|The {{planet was}} claimed, in September 2010, {{to have been}} {{detected}} by astronomers in the Lick–Carnegie Exoplanet Survey, led by principal investigator Steven Vogt, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and co-investigator R. Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. The discovery was made using radial velocity measurements, combining 122 observations obtained over 11 years from the HIRES instrument of the W. M. Keck Observatory with 119 measurements obtained over 4.3 years from the HARPS instrument of the ESO 3.6 m Telescope at <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> Observatory. In addition, brightness measurements of the star were confirmed with a robotic telescope from Tennessee State University.|$|E
500|$|Referred to as Epsilon Eridanib, {{this planet}} was {{announced}} in 2000, but the discovery has remained controversial. A comprehensive study in 2008 called the detection [...] "tentative" [...] and described the proposed planet as [...] "long suspected but still unconfirmed". Many astronomers believed the evidence is sufficiently compelling that they regard the discovery as confirmed. As of 2013, the discovery remains in doubt because a search program at <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> Observatory did not confirm it exists.|$|E
500|$|The {{rings of}} Neptune consist {{primarily}} of five principal rings and were first discovered (as [...] "arcs") in 1984 in Chile by Patrice Bouchet, Reinhold Häfner and Jean Manfroid at <b>La</b> <b>Silla</b> Observatory (ESO) during an observing program proposed by André Brahic and Bruno Sicardy from Paris Observatory, and at Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory by F. Vilas and L.-R. Elicer {{for a program}} led by William Hubbard. They were eventually imaged in 1989 by the Voyager 2 spacecraft. At their densest, they are comparable to the less dense portions of Saturn's main rings such as the C ring and the Cassini Division, but much of Neptune's ring system is quite tenuous, faint and dusty, more closely resembling the rings of Jupiter. Neptune's rings are named after astronomers who contributed important work on the planet: Galle, Le Verrier, Lassell, Arago, and Adams. Neptune also has a faint unnamed ring coincident with the orbit of the moon Galatea. Three other moons orbit between the rings: Naiad, Thalassa and Despina.|$|E
