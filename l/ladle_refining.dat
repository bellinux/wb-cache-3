This cylinder, {{referred to as}} an electrode is then put into a large cylindrical enclosed crucible and brought to a metallurgical vacuum (...) [...] At {{the bottom of the}} crucible is a small amount of the alloy to be remelted, which the top electrode is brought close to prior to starting the melt. Several kiloamperes of DC current are used to start an arc between the two pieces, and from there, a continuous melt is derived. The crucible (typically made of copper) is surrounded by a water jacket used to cool the melt and control the solidification rate. To prevent arcing between the electrode and the crucible side walls, the diameter of the crucible is larger than that of the electrode. As a result, the electrode must be lowered as the melt consumes it. Control of the current, cooling water, and electrode gap is essential to effective control of the process, and production of defect free material.|$|E

40|$|Several {{aspects of}} ultrasound-assisted mineral {{carbonation}} were investigated in this work. The objectives were to intensify the CO 2 sequestration process to improve reaction kinetics and maximal conversion. Stainless steel slags, {{derived from the}} Argon Oxygen Decarburization (AOD) and Continuous Casting / <b>Ladle</b> Metallurgy (CC/LM) <b>refining</b> steps, were used for assessing the technical feasibility of this concept, as they are potential carbon sinks and can benefit from reduction in alkalinity (pH) by mineral carbonation. Ultrasound was applied by use of an ultrasound horn into the reaction slurry, where mineral carbonation reaction took place at 50 oC for up to four hours; comparison was made to solely mechanically mixed process. It was found that sonication increases the reaction rate after the initial stage, and permits achieving higher carbonate conversion and lower pH. AOD slag conversion increased from 30 % to 49 %, and pH decreased from 10. 6 to 10. 1; CC slag conversion increased from 61 % to 73 % and pH decreased from 10. 8 to 9. 9. The enhancement effect of ultrasound was attributed to the removal of passivating layers (precipitated calcium carbonate and depleted silica) that surround the unreacted particle core and inhibit mass transfer. Significant particle size reduction was observed for sonicated powders, compared to particle size growth {{in the case of}} stirring only; D[4, 3] values increased without sonication by 74 % and 50 %, and decreased with sonication by 64 % and 52 %, respectively for AOD and CC slags.

40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} model for calculating the sulfur distribution ratio between <b>ladle</b> furnace (LF) <b>refining</b> slags and molten steel {{has been developed}} by coupling with a developed {{thermodynamic model}} for calculating the mass action concentrations of structural units in LF refining slags, i. e., CaO-SiO 2 -MgO-FeO-MnO-Al 2 O 3 hexabasic slags, based on the ion and molecule coexistence theory (IMCT). The calculated mass action concentrations of structural units in CaO-SiO 2 -MgO-FeO-Al 2 O 3 -MnO slags equilibrated or reacted with molten steel show that the calculated equilibrium mole numbers or mass action concentrations of structural units or ion couples, rather than mass percentage of components, in the slags can represent their reaction abilities. The calculated total sulfur distribution ratio shows a reliable agreement with the measured or the calculated sulfur distribution ratio between the slags and molten steel by other models under the condition of choosing oxygen activity based on (FeO) -[O] equilibrium. Meanwhile, the developed thermodynamic model for calculating sulfur distribution ratio can quantitatively determine the respective contribution of free CaO, MgO, FeO, and MnO in the LF refining slags. A significant difference of desulfurization ability among free component as CaO, MgO, FeO, and MnO has been found with approximately 87 - 93 pct, 11. 43 - 5. 85 pct, 0. 81 - 0. 60 pct and 0. 30 - 0. 27 pct at both middle and final stages during LF refining process, respectively. A large difference of oxygen activity is found in molten steel at the slag-metal interface and in bulk molten steel. The oxygen activity in molten steel at the slag-metal interface is controlled by (FeO) -[O] equilibrium, whereas the oxygen activity in bulk molten steel is controlled by [Al]-[O] equilibrium.

The predicted sulfide capacity of the LF refining slags has better accuracy than the measured sulfide capacity of the slags at the middle and final stages during the LF refining process. Increasing slag binary basicity, optical basicity, and the Mannesmann index can {{lead to an increase}} of the predicted sulfide capacity for the LF refining slags as well as to an increase of the sulfur distribution ratio between the slags and molten steel at the middle and final stages during the LF refining process. The calculated equilibrium mole numbers, mass action concentrations of structural units or ion couples, rather than mass percentages of components, are recommended to represent the slag composition for correlating with the sulfide capacity of the slags. The developed sulfide capacity IMCT model can calculate not only the total sulfide capacity of the slags but also the respective sulfide capacity of free CaO, MgO, FeO, and MnO in the slags. The comprehensive contribution of the combined ion couples (Ca 2 + + O 2 -) and (Mn 2 + + O 2 -) on the desulfurization reactions accounts for 96. 23 pct; meanwhile, the average contribution of the ion couple (Fe 2 + + O 2 -) and (Mg 2 + + O 2 -) only has a negligible contribution as 3. 13 pct and 0. 25 pct during the LF refining process, respectively. The oxygen activity of bulk molten steel in LF is controlled by the [Al]-[O] equilibrium, and the oxygen activity of molten steel at the slag-metal interface is controlled by the (FeO) -[O] equilibrium. The ratio of the oxygen activity of molten steel at the slag-metal interface to the oxygen activity of bulk molten steel will decrease from 37 to 5 at the initial stage, and further decrease from 28 to 4 at the middle stage, but will maintain at a reliable constant as 5 to 14 at the final stage during the LF refining process.

The research was conducted using chromium-nickel- molybdenum steel intended for heat treatment in order to produce crankshafts. Design/methodology/approach: This research was conducted in a ladle furnace with the capacity of 65 Mg of steel. Data from 10 melts were analysed. Samples of refining slag and metal were taken to analyse their chemical composition. On their basis researchers analysed the process of desulphurisation of steel at the ladle furnace workstation. Calculations were made concerning the equilibrium chemical composition of slag to determine the share of gas phase, liquid phase and solid precipitations. The calculations were made using a thermodynamic software FactSage 6. 2. Findings: Analysing the process of desulphurisation of steel under slag with the average chemical composition of: CaO – 54. 0 %, Al 2 O 3 - 30. 2 %, SiO 2 9. 0 %, MgO – 8. 2 %, and FeO content at the level of 0. 94 % drew attention to a high degree of desulphurisation at the level of 86 %. Due to this fact it was possible to obtain high basicity of slag: V=CaO/SiO 2 at the level of 6. 21. Mannesmann index, which characterizes the ability of slag to remove sulphur and non-metallic inclusions from steel and is defined as M=(CaO/SiO 2) /Al 2 O 3, amounted to 0. 21 %- 1 and was too low in comparison to the required one ranging from 0. 35 - 0. 45 %- 1. The calculations concerning the equilibrium chemical composition of slag, which determined the share of gas phase, liquid phase and solid precipitations, were performed using the thermodynamic software FactSage 6. 2. These calculations showed that there were no solid precipitations present. The refining process under slag used in this research proved to be extremely efficient in terms of desulphurisation. Research limitations/implications: It was concluded that the slag forming technology in the ladle is correct in terms of materials used, both as far as their type and amount are concerned. Deoxidation is efficient. Practical implications: It is important to ensure that the furnace slag does not enter the ladle. As a result, {{it will be possible to}} improve the quality of the refining slag.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of new steel grades is largely driven {{by the need to}} produce high quality steel at a competitive price. The principal aims are to attain ultra-high purity, (especially low interstitial elements) and ultra-cleanliness (by the control of the inclusion content and size). Whereas the steel used to build the Titanic contained 650 ppm sulphur, resulting in MnS stringer-inclusions 25 mm in length, modern quality requirements for arctic pipelines would only allow 10 ppm of sulphur and inclusions in ball-bearing steels must be smaller than 5 µm.

Minimal variation in product sizing is vital because it impacts on handling problems and because particle size determines the rate of particle dissolution.

40|$|The {{formation}} of silica fume when liquid metal is {{in contact with}} air during refining of metallurgical grade silicon leads to a direct loss of silicon. Apart from this yield loss the associated fume may be harmful to the workers in the plant. During tapping, refining and casting of silicon, the fume formation makes up 40 – 80 % of the fugitive emissions from the plant. In this work, the kinetics and mechanisms of fume formation during refining of metallurgical grade silicon were studied. Active oxidation {{is defined as the}} partial oxidation of Si to the gaseous product SiO. This type of oxidation does not protect the surface from further attack (passivation). When reviewing relevant literature, the majority of the research on active oxidation of silicon is done on solid silicon Research to date on liquid silicon oxidation on the other hand is primarily theoretical. As such, there is a knowledge gap concerning a mechanistic understanding of the active oxidation of liquid silicon. Boundary conditions, rate-controlling factors and flux dependencies on oxygen partial pressure and gas flow rate have not been systematically studied experimentally for active oxidation of liquid silicon. The amount of fume on an industrial scale and the characteristics of the fume such as elemental content, particle size and shape have not been adequately explored. In this project, the active oxidation of liquid silicon was investigated at three different scales; industrial measurements (~ 7 tonne Si); small-scale experiments 10 g Si); and medium-scale induction furnace experiments (1750 g Si). An experimental element distribution analysis of both main and trace-elements in the industrial <b>refining</b> <b>ladle</b> was performed. It was found that the amount of fume formed during industrial refining is in the range 0. 7 – 1. 8 kg of SiO 2 per tonne silicon produced. The main mechanism of SiO 2 -fume formation is oxidation of the surface, so that the exposed surface area is a main parameter controlling the fume formation in the industry. The boundary conditions for the oxidation of a still Si surface were determined from the small-scale experiments. The measurements confirmed an approximated theoretical mass transfer rate of oxygen and a maximum bulk oxygen pressure for active oxidation. From the induction furnace experiments {{it was found that the}} primary factor determining the rate of fume formation is the rate of transport of oxygen to the surface, which in turn is given by the velocity of the gas above the surface. This work is the first qualitative and quantitative study containing experimental investigations from small-scale to industrial scale on the kinetic and mechanistic nature of silicon oxidation. The industrial work has also contributes to a better understanding of distribution of elements in the silicon refining process, and it gives implications for emission estimation of toxic and other trace elements to the environment.

40|$|The {{quality of}} {{continuous}} cast steel depends greatly {{on the extent}} of inclusion particle entrapment, which is governed by flow transport phenomena in the mold region. As part of a long-term effort to develop and apply comprehensive models of these and other phenomena, this paper reports on work during the second year of this NSF grant that aims 1) to develop quantitative models of transient flow of molten steel, superheat and inclusions during the continuous casting of steel, and 2) to apply them to improve understanding and efficiency of inclusion particle removal in the process. Results are reported here for five interrelated subprojects. Firstly, models of transient flow using Large Eddy Simulation (LES), which were previously validated and used to predict flow, are used here to predict the accompanying transport of inclusion particles. Of most significance, the model can predict the ultimate distribution of inclusions in the final product. Models are then applied to investigate the effect of nozzle geometry on flow and inclusion removal. Thirdly, model improvements are presented to predict inclusion size distribution evolution. As inclusion removal in the mold is shown to be quite small, simulations are extending upstream to investigate inclusion removal during <b>ladle</b> <b>refining.</b> Fourthly, behavior of the top surface flux layers, which is important to inclusion removal, is computed, including the effects of natural convection...|$|E
