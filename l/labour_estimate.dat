40|$|The study {{addresses}} the comparability of child <b>labour</b> <b>estimates</b> produced by different common household survey instruments. This question {{has important implications}} for credibility of published <b>estimates</b> of child <b>labour,</b> and for the reliability of current survey instruments as tools for monitoring and guiding efforts towards the progressive elimination of child labour. The study, covering some 87 datasets for 35 countries, first confirms that <b>estimates</b> of child <b>labour</b> vary significantly across different kinds of surveys. The variation, moreover, appears to be substantially larger than that relative to other children’s activities like schooling. The study then addresses whether the observed significant differences in estimates are due to difference in population characteristics or to other features of the surveys. In other words, whether different populations are targeted by the various surveys, or whether they address the same (or very similar) population with different instruments. The empirical results indicate that it is the latter explanation, i. e., differences in survey features are most relevant. Differences in observable survey characteristics such as questionnaire type and fieldwork season explain some of the variation in child <b>labour</b> <b>estimates</b> across survey instruments, but a larger part of the variation stems from unobservable survey characteristics. Elements of the survey process not spelled out in the survey documentation, such as interview methods, the familiarity of interviewers with child labour concepts, the accuracy of data coding and processing, are all likely to be important in this context. ...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] This is {{the fourth}} issue of the ILO 2 ̆ 7 s report series: Global <b>Estimates</b> on Child <b>Labour.</b> The present Report {{provides}} new global and regional <b>estimates</b> on child <b>labour</b> for the year 2012 and compares them with the previous estimates for 2000, 2004 and 2008. The Report draws on an increasing amount of data from national-level child labour surveys (SIMPOC surveys) and other sources. Understanding Children 2 ̆ 7 s Work (UCW), an interagency programme on child labour statistics and research, provided access to non-ILO data and assisted in the analysis. The new child <b>labour</b> <b>estimates</b> are based on refined estimation techniques fully comparable with the ones for 2000, 2004 and 2008 rounds. They also benefited from: (a) the international standards on child labour statistics adopted by the 18 th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) in 2008; and (b) an integrated approach to estimation using standardized tabulation schemes for national data and composite estimation procedures for arriving at regional and global trends. The remainder of the Report is structured as follows. Chapter 1 highlights the main estimation findings for 2012. Chapter 2 presents the current child labour situation. Chapter 3 presents the dynamic child labour situation, comparing estimation results from 2012 with those of 2000, 2004 and 2008. For Chapters 2 and 3, data are disaggregated {{to the extent possible}} by age group, sex, region, branch of economic activity, national income category and status in employment. Chapter 4 provides some pointers for the way forward. The Annex spells out the concepts and methodology underlying the global child <b>labour</b> <b>estimates...</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper {{examines}} both theoretically and empirically {{the factors}} determining {{the demand for}} regular labour in seasonal agriculture. In an implicit contract framework {{it is argued that}} there are ‘hoarding costs’ of regular labour in the slack period when there is not much work to be done. Consequently, the number of regular labour employed is constrained by the hoarding cost where larger employment-intensive farms tend to hire more regular labour. Evidence from the ICRISAT villages in India, too, show that though the marginal costs of regular labour are zero, there are significant hoarding costs of regular labour among small farms so that larger farmers are the major demanders of regular <b>labour.</b> <b>Estimates</b> of the double-hurdle model jointly determining the probability of hiring regular labour and demand for regular labour-hours (if a regular labour is hired) are shown to be an improvement over univariate tobit estimates of the demand for regular labour-hours only...|$|R

40|$|The study {{begins with}} a survey {{of some of the}} {{theoretical}} work on the wage-change equation, followed by a complementary summary of some of the empirical evidence on the determinants of wage inflation in the United Kingdom for the post war sample period. Estimates are then presented of the wage-change equation for the United Kingdom for the chosen (1950 - 70) sample period, using annual data, in order to explore the sensitivity of the results to the use of alternative wage- rate and unemployment series, and to the use of alternative definitions of the time rate of change variables. The main enquiry of the study centres {{on the use of the}} unemployment rate as an efficient proxy for the degree of excess demand for labour in the theory of the Phillips curve. It is possible that the observed instability of the curve may reflect the fact that the reported unemployment rate has become increasingly inefficient as such a proxy. An important source of error in the reported unemployment statistics is due to the non-registration by 'secondary' workers in the <b>labour</b> force. <b>Estimates</b> are presented of some 'adjusted' unemployment series which take into account the cyclical nature of this non-registration; and which are worked up from an analysis of participation rates in the United Kingdom. These estimates are carried over into an analysis of the 'mapping' from excess demand to unemployment where the objective is to identify and measure changes in the level of 'maladjustment' unemployment (the level associated with zero aggregate excess demand for <b>labour).</b> <b>Estimates</b> are obtained of maladjustment unemployment, and these are used to further correct the unemployment statistics for changes in 'maladjustment' unemployment. Finally this corrected unemployment series is incorporated in the aggregate wage-change equation to re-examine the statistical significance of the Phillips relation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role of wage {{moderation}} and labour and product market regulation for employment creation. To this end, <b>labour</b> demand <b>estimates</b> are presented for the five largest euro area countries at the aggregate level and for three macro sectors: manufacturing, construction and services. Estimates are carried out for individual countries {{as well as for}} the pooled group of countries. This paper shows that labour cost moderation generally helps employment creation, notwithstanding the fact that elasticities of employment to labour costs vary across the countries and sectors analysed. It also shows that some key institutional/structural variables add to the explanation of labour demand developments. In particular, in some countries and sectors, our results point to a negative link between employment growth, the unemployment benefit replacement rate and product market regulation.
