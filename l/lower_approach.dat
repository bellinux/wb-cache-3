40|$|When {{feeding on}} mysid swarms (Paramesopodopsis rufa), {{juvenile}} Australian salmon (Arripis trutta) had {{higher rates of}} successful attacks when foraging {{in a group of}} six fish (55 % total advances) than when foraging alone (39 % total advances). Six schooling fish had <b>lower</b> <b>approach</b> rates than solitary fish (25 % and 37 % of total advances, respectively). This result indicated that schooling fish were better at reducing the confusion effect of swarming prey, resulting in more efficient feeding. In larger areas, schools achieved higher rates of successful attacks (19 prey/fish in the large tank, compared with 11 prey/fish in the smaller tank). There was no influence on the feeding success of individual fish when changes were made to the number of prey presented to each fish. Nearest neighbour distances were smallest in the absence of prey, and increased with the introduction of prey and again in an attack sequence. Six fish schooled more cohesively than three fish, indicating increased benefits of schooling in larger groups that contribute to advanced vigilance and foraging techniques...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The role of {{planning}} in binge eating episodes is unknown. We investigated the characteristics {{of planning}} associated with food cues in binging patients. We studied planning based on backward reasoning, reasoning that determines a sequence of actions back to front from the final outcome. Method: A cross-sectional {{study was conducted with}} 20 healthy participants, 20 bulimia nervosa (BN), 22 restrictive (ANR) and 23 binging anorexia nervosa (ANB), without any concomitant impulsive disorder. In neutral/relaxing, binge food and stressful conditions, backward reasoning was assessed with the Race game, promotion of delayed large rewards with an intertemporal discounting task, attention with the Simon task, and repeating a dominant behavior with the Go/No-go task. Results: BN and to a lower extent ANB patients succeeded more at the Race game in food than in neutral condition. This difference discriminated binging from non-binging participants. Backward reasoning in the food condition was associated with <b>lower</b> <b>approach</b> behavior toward food in BN patients, and higher food avoidance in ANB patients. Enhanced backward reasoning in the food condition related to preferences for delayed large rewards in BN patients. In BN and ANB patients the enhanced success rate at the Race game in the food condition was associated with higher attention paid to binge food. Conclusion: These findings introduce a novel process underlying binges: planning based on backward reasoning is associated with binges. It likely aims to reduce craving for binge foods and extend binge refractory period in BN patients, and avoid binging in ANB patients. Shifts between these goals might explain shifts between eating disorder subtypes...|$|E

40|$|Two {{questions}} {{emerge from}} the literature concerning the perceptual-motor processes underlying the visual regulation of step length. The first concerns the effects of velocity on the onset of visual control (VCO), when visual regulation of step length begins during goal-directed locomotion. The second concerns the effects of different obstacles such as a target or raised surface on step length regulation. In two separate experiments, participants (Experiment 1 & 2 : n= 12, 6 female, 6 male) walked, jogged, or sprinted towards an obstacle along a 10 m walkway, consisting of two marker-strips with alternating black and white 0. 50 m markings. Each experiment consisted of three targeting or obstacle tasks with the requirement to both negotiate and continue moving (run-through) through the target. Five trials were conducted for each task and approach speed, with trials block randomised between the six participants of each gender. One 50 Hz video camera panned and filmed each trial from an elevated position, adjacent to the walkway. Video footage was digitized to deduce the gait characteristics. Results for the targeting tasks indicate a linear relationship between approach velocity and accuracy of final foot placement (r= 0. 89). When foot placement was highly constrained by the obstacle step length shortened during the entire approach. VCO was found to occur at an earlier tau-margin for <b>lower</b> <b>approach</b> velocities for both experiments, indicating that the optical variable ‘tau 2 ̆ 7 is affected by approach velocity.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports on}} the effective and efficient use of ozone in cooling water treatment systems. The study focuses on proving that ozone treated systems will: (1) Improve compressor energy consumption; (2) Improve the heat exchangers efficiency through limited scale deposition and fouling; (3) Reduce water consumption; and (4) Encourage or support corrosion at high concentrations compared to when cooling water is chemically treated. For this study, data log readings from compressor heat exchanger approach temperatures were used for energy saving calculations and equipment efficiency (scaling). Using conservation of energy principles and municipal power costs, {{it was found that}} over four years, R 425 991 was saved. Conventional chemical cooling water treatment systems showed high approach temperatures, resulting in high scaling rates and high energy consumption in the compressors. In contrast, ozone cooling water treatment systems showed a <b>lower</b> <b>approach</b> temperatures which resulted in lower scaling rates and lower energy consumption in the compressors. Also, for this study data log readings from cooling water flow rates and weekly water quality analyses were used for water saving calculation and corrosion predictions. In ozone cooling water treatment systems, there was a reduction in makeup water use confirming water savings. According to Mosugelo (2010) water quality is a bigger contributor to corrosion than ozone is. In cooling water treatment systems with good quality makeup water, ozone treated systems were found to have lower corrosion rates in the heat exchangers than conventional chemicals systems. It can be concluded that effective and efficient use of ozone in cooling water treatment provides triple bottom line benefits (economic, social and environmental). Environmental benefits include effluent disposal reduction, water and energy conservation. Social benefits include safety and health impacts. Ozone treated cooling water systems are a technically practical, cost-effective and sensible alternative when compared to conventional cooling water treatment systems...|$|E

S. population, {{there is a need for}} research to focus on how this population adjusts to the impending end of physical life. More attention is needed on what it means to be dying and what factors affect death attitudes in ethnically diverse geriatric individuals, particularly in those who are facing their own mortality. The present study was a partial replication of a previous study conducted by Daaleman and Dobbs (2010) and investigated potential meaningful relationships between death attitudes with demographic variables, mental and physical health indices, social support, spirituality, and intrinsic religiosity in chronically ill older adults. The present study used archival data from a previous University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa IRB-approved research study conducted by the author from 2012 - 2013, which included data collected from 69 institutionalized elderly participants from five nursing homes and an assisted care facility on the island of O‘ahu in the State of Hawai‘i, U. S. A. Descriptive analyses indicated significant differences between the community-dwelling participants from the Daaleman and Dobbs (2010) study and the present study’s institutionalized participants. Results from correlational, regression, and ANOVA procedures indicated significant differences in death attitudes based on demographic and health variables and reported levels of spirituality and religiosity. Older adults with greater spirituality and intrinsic religiosity had significantly more positive death attitudes. Additionally, Buddhist, Japanese, married, or male elders reported significantly <b>lower</b> <b>approach</b> acceptance of death compared to Catholics, Filipinos, African Americans, Hispanics, widows, or females. Findings from the present study have important theoretical and practical implications in numerous fields of study and practice. These results indicate that ethnicity, religious/ spiritual affiliation, marital status, and gender are important demographic variables to consider when examining death attitudes within a multi-ethnic elderly population, even among Asian and Hawai‘ian or Pacific Island cultures. Further investigation and exploration into the role of cultural and religious/ spiritual beliefs will undoubtedly be valuable in gaining a better understanding of factors related to death attitudes in ethnic minorities. Potential implications and recommendations for the application of these findings are discussed...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} design of interplanetary {{missions}} for the continual habitation of Mars via Earth-Mars cyclers and {{for the detection of}} variations in nuclear decay rates due to solar influences. ^ Several cycler concepts have been proposed to provide safe and comfortable quarters for astronauts traveling between the Earth and Mars. However, no literature has appeared to show how these massive vehicles might be placed into their cycler trajectories. Trajectories are designed that use either V∞ leveraging or low thrust to establish cycler vehicles in their desired orbits. In the cycler trajectory cases considered, the use of V∞ leveraging or low thrust substantially reduces the total propellant needed to achieve the cycler orbit compared to direct orbit insertion. In the case of the classic Aldrin cycler, the propellant savings due to V∞ leveraging can be as large as a 24 metric ton reduction for a cycler vehicle with a dry mass of 75 metric tons, and an additional 111 metric ton reduction by instead using low thrust. The two-synodic period cyclers considered benefit less from V∞ leveraging, but have a smaller total propellant mass due to their <b>lower</b> <b>approach</b> velocities at Earth and Mars. It turns out that, for low-thrust establishment, the propellant required is approximately the same for each of the cycler trajectories. ^ The Aldrin cycler has been proposed as a transportation system for human missions between Earth and Mars. However, the hyperbolic excess velocity values at the planetary encounters for these orbits are infeasibly large, especially at Mars. In {{a new version of the}} Aldrin cycler, low thrust is used in the interplanetary trajectories to reduce the encounter velocities. Reducing the encounter velocities at both planets reduces the propellant needed by the taxis (astronauts use these taxis to transfer between the planetary surfaces and the cycler vehicle) to perform hyperbolic rendezvous. While the propellant expenditure for the cycler vehicle increases, trade studies over seven synodic periods show that the low-thrust Aldrin cycler is effective in reducing the total (i. e., cycler plus taxi) initial mass in low-Earth orbit. ^ A mission is proposed whose architecture is a series of stopovers, unlike conventional cycler trajectories that string series of flybys together. The vehicle would be captured into orbits about the Earth and Mars without landing on either planet. The zero hyperbolic-excess velocities with respect to the planets keep the mass of the taxis low. To allow a mission in every launch opportunity, the cycler vehicle is required to make a complete round trip in less than the synodic period of the two planets (i. e. 2 1 / 7 years). A high level of acceleration is required to satisfy the itinerary, which results in a large mass (90 metric tons) for the power generator. Fortuitously, the high (11 MWe) power level of the propulsion system would also be effective in hauling the cargo payload via a spiral trajectory about the Earth. Because one synodic period is not enough for the cycler vehicle to fly both the interplanetary trajectories and the Earth-spiral trajectories, it is suggested that two nuclear power generators be developed, which could alternate flying the interplanetary trajectories and the Earth-spiral trajectories. Once these power generators are launched and begin operating in space, the mass requirement in seven subsequent missions (over a period of 15 years beginning in 2022) would be modest at 254 to 296 metric tons to low-Earth orbit per mission. Two launches of NASA 2 ̆ 7 s Space Launch System for the cargo and one launch of the Falcon 9 Heavy for the crew would be more than adequate to maintain support for each consecutive mission. ^ Previously, cycling trajectories have been constructed by finding the solution to Lambert 2 ̆ 7 s problem between two planetary encounters that occur some multiple of a synodic period apart. In this work, the relative equations of motion are investigated to determine if they can be used to find new cycler trajectories, as well as those previously discovered. First order approximations to the relative motion equations are unfruitful for Earth-Mars cyclers because the variation in radial distance from the Sun is too large. However, using optimization techniques, cycling trajectories are found for the Earth-Mars, Earth-Ceres, and Mars-Ceres systems. ^ Experiments showing a seasonal variation of the nuclear decay rates of a number of different nuclei and decay anomalies— apparently related to solar flares and solar rotation— have suggested that the Sun may somehow be influencing nuclear decay processes. Recently, there have been searches for such an effect in 238 Pu nuclei contained in the radioisotope thermoelectric generators on board the Cassini spacecraft. In this work, that analysis is modified and extended to obtain constraints on anomalous decays of 238 Pu over a wider range of models, but these limits cannot be applied to other nuclei if the anomaly is composition-dependent. It is also shown that it may require very high sensitivity for terrestrial experiments to discriminate among some models if such a decay anomaly exists, motivating the consideration of future spacecraft experiments which would require less precision. ^ A mission on which such an experiment could be run is proposed. The proposed mission will take various isotopes on a spacecraft that has a large variation in radial distance and return them to Earth. Two different types of trajectories are considered: one with intermediate Venus flybys and one that injects directly into an Earth-resonant orbit. It is shown that each of these types of trajectories have their relative merits with regards to the scientific objective. The suitability of the upcoming Solar Probe Plus and Solar Orbiter missions to perform this experiment is also investigated. ...|$|E
