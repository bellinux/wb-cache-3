The effects, particularly on the learning of software agents, are analyzed. DLNR’s goal is to increase students' learning motivation through dynamically clarifying and reflecting their <b>learning</b> <b>need.</b> To achieve this goal, DLNR includes “prerequisite conditions”, “no compulsory subjects”, “payment for each learning subject”, and “GPA (Grade Point Average) ” for estimating learning results. Using a tool developed for realizing DLNR, students design their <b>learning</b> <b>need,</b> namely their own graduation timeline by themselves to achieve their academic goal towards their job after graduation. Through taking classes, students dynamically modify the timeline reflectively according to the intermediate results such as shown by GPA. DLNR’s effects are evaluated.

In contrast to traditional e-learning systems where didactically engineered courses address the user’s learning interest, we provide learning snippets that directly relate to potential short-term informational learning goals.

For these concepts we determine different types of learning material from different sources that answer the current <b>learning</b> <b>need</b> about the concept...|$|R

2500|$|Much of {{the spring}} and summer of Graham's second year in office was {{dominated}} by the debate of French second-language programs. [...] In February, a commission recommended that government should scrap early immersion in favour of a universal curriculum in elementary school which would see anglophone students learn in their mother tongue from kindergarten through Grade 4 and then all study French through an intensive program in Grade 5 before choosing between an immersion or non-immersion program. The commission said that this was the best route because under the existing model, over 93% of those students with special <b>learning</b> <b>needs</b> were being streamed into non-immersion classrooms, though critics argued the problem was a lack of the type of resources that would enable more students to stay in immersion programmes. In March, Minister of Education Kelly Lamrock announced that the government would move forward with the recommendations for the reasons stated by the commissioners. Lamrock said the changes would further promote bilingualism by giving all students access to a quality second-language program noting that the early immersion model had been implemented in a time when there was resistance to bilingualism and that it only worked well for small groups of students, not the large groups that were now interested in becoming bilingual. There was considerable opposition to this move, including from the province's official languages commissioner and ombudsman. [...] In June, the Court of Queen's Bench ruled on a case brought forward by opponents to the changes. The court sided with the opponents on one ground that the government had implied that there would be two months of consultation on the commission report, when there had only been two weeks. Though the court ruled in favour of the government on two other grounds, it quashed the decision saying that the government could go forward with the changes as is but first must consult the public. [...] Following an additional six weeks of consultation, on August 5 the government announced a revised model to be implemented in September 2008, which would provide a [...] "universal learning environment" [...] including exposure to French culture from kindergarten through Grade 2 projected to start in 2009, an optional entry to immersion in Grade 3 projected to start in 2010, further French instruction for non-immersion students in grades 3 through 5 with another optional entry to late immersion in Grade 6.
