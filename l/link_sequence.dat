40|$|Abstract – Website {{visitors}} often prefer different link sequences {{depending on}} their goals and changing interests to reach at desired pages in a website. There can {{be more than one}} alternate path to reach at any web page. When browsing large websites, users often depart from main subject temporarily and pursue digressive paths within websites, prolonging navigation time. In order to serve the website visitors better, this paper proposes Adaptive <b>Link</b> <b>Sequence</b> Recommendation (ALSR) approach which identifies target pages based on group of user access patterns, displays most prominent K target pages and recommends adaptive <b>link</b> <b>sequence</b> to them. Adaptive <b>link</b> <b>sequence</b> refers to selecting the order of links by aggregating surfing activities of individual users into a collective preference and their temporal perceptions into a collective perception. Adaptive <b>link</b> <b>sequence</b> computation is inspired from the foraging behavior of biological ants. Also, pheromone updating strategy known from ant algorithms for computing the weights on the edges of the co-occurrence graph containing web pages as nodes is applied to assess user access patterns. A prototype website is designed and the proposed approach is tested. Experiments show that the approach is efficient and allows users to arrive at the most prominent target pages quickly.

However, because link-level properties cannot be uniquely determined from end-to-end measurements, the accuracy of existing statistical diagnosis approaches is subject to uncertainty from statistical assumptions about the network. In this paper, we propose a novel Least-biased End-to-end Network Diagnosis (in short, LEND) system for inferring link-level properties like loss rate. We define a minimal identifiable <b>link</b> <b>sequence</b> (MILS) as a <b>link</b> <b>sequence</b> of minimal length whose properties can be uniquely identified from end-to-end measurements. We also design efficient algorithms to find all the MILSes and infer their loss rates for diagnosis. Our LEND system works for any network topology and for both directed and undirected properties, and incrementally adapts to network topology and property changes. It gives highly accurate estimates of the loss rates of MILSes, as indicated by both extensive simulations and Internet experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such diagnosis can be achieved with fine granularity and in near real-time even for reasonably large overlay networks. Finally, LEND can supplement existing statistical inference approaches and provide smooth tradeoff between diagnosis accuracy and granularity...|$|E

However, most existing map-matching algorithms process GPS data with high sampling rates, to achieve a higher correct rate and strong universality. This paper introduces a novel map-matching algorithm based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) for GPS positioning and mobile phone positioning with a low sampling rate. The HMM is a statistical model well known for providing solutions to temporal recognition applications such as text and speech recognition. In this work, the hidden Markov chain model was built to establish a map-matching process, using the geometric data, the topologies matrix of road links in road network and refined quad-tree data structure. HMM-based map-matching exploits the Viterbi algorithm to find the optimized road <b>link</b> <b>sequence.</b> The sequence consists of hidden states in the HMM model. The HMM-based map-matching algorithm is validated on a vehicle trajectory using GPS and mobile phone data.
