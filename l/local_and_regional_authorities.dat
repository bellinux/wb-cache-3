25|$|All {{international}} human rights law is based in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted in 1948. This document outlines the inalienable and fundamental rights of humankind that are protected regardless of gender, race, class, sexual orientation, religion, or any other social, economic, or political factor. The articles in the UDHR are not legally binding, but they are recognized as part of customary international law, and they authorize the development of binding international treaties, which countries may choose to sign and ratify. International human rights treaties and monitoring processes, however, privileges national governments and limits the role of local officials, whose cooperation {{in the implementation of}} international law is critical. The day-to-day work of implementing human rights standards often rests on the shoulders of <b>local</b> <b>and</b> <b>regional</b> <b>authorities.</b> They too are bound by these agreements. <b>Local</b> <b>and</b> <b>regional</b> <b>authorities</b> are often directly responsible for services related to health care, education, housing, water supply, environment, policing and also, in many cases, taxation.|$|E
25|$|The {{circular}} caused {{national political}} commotion and reflects the conflicting {{perception of language}} facilities in Dutch and French-speaking public opinion. The non-appointment of three mayors of municipalities with language facilities — refused by the Flemish government because they repeatedly ignored the Peeters (and Keulen) directives — was a highly mediatised issue during the 2007–2008 Belgian government formation. It attracted international attention when the mayors took their case to the Congress of <b>Local</b> <b>and</b> <b>Regional</b> <b>Authorities</b> of the Council of Europe.|$|E
25|$|In October 1974, {{responsibility}} for issuing registrations was transferred from <b>local</b> <b>and</b> <b>regional</b> <b>authorities</b> to specialist Local Vehicle Licensing Offices (LVLOs) or Vehicle Registration Offices (VROs) {{run by the}} DVLA. Most of the two-letter area codes allocated during the first scheme continued in their respective areas, albeit now indicating the nearest LVLO/VRO rather than the local or regional authority. However, the decision to streamline the allocations of these codes meant that some were transferred to new areas. For instance, the former Suffolk code CF was transferred to Reading, while the former Edinburgh code WS was re-allocated to Bristol.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a project, funded by the British Academy, on perceptions of SEA effectiveness in two countries with formal SEA requirements, but with very different planning and decision-making traditions: the UK and China. Similarities and differences are described, based on a questionnaire survey, conducted at two workshops with <b>local</b> <b>and</b> <b>regional</b> <b>authority</b> representatives, private consultants and academics; at Liverpool University (October 2006) and at Nankai University (March 2007). Whilst many similarities in perceptions are found, some differences are established, particularly regarding the SEA process (which Chinese representatives think should be more flexible versus UK representatives who mostly {{think it should be}} more rigorous) and regarding current shortcomings (lack of real influence and non-existence of relevant baseline data for China; too much unused baseline data for the UK). Overall, there was a more positive perception of many Chinese respondents regarding SEA's potential to lead to more effective decision making, greater efficiency of tiered decision making and an ability to enable more effective involvement.

40|$|Objectives In Denmark, the <b>local</b> <b>and</b> <b>regional</b> health <b>authorities</b> share {{responsibility}} for cardiac rehabilitation (CR). The {{objective was to}} assess effectiveness of CR across sectors coordinated by a nurse case manager (NCM). Design A one-year follow-up study. Setting A CR programme (GoHeart) was evaluated in a cohort at Lillebaelt Hospital Vejle, DK from 2010 to 2011. Participants Consecutive patients admitted to CR were included. The inclusion criteria were the event of acute myocardial infarction or stable angina and invasive revascularization (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 45 %). Main outcome measures Cardiac risk factors, stratified self-care and self-reported psychosocial factors (SF 12 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)) were assessed at admission (phase IIa), at three months at discharge (phase IIb) and at one-year follow-up (phase III). Intention-to-treat and predefined subgroup analysis on sex was performed. Results Of 241 patients, 183 (75. 9 %) were included (mean age 63. 8 years). At discharge improvements were found in total-cholesterol (p [*]<[*] 0. 001), low density lipoprotein (LDL; p [*]<[*] 0. 001), functional capacities (metabolic equivalent of tasks (METS), p [*]<[*] 0. 01), self-care management (p [*]<[*] 0. 001), Health status Short Form 12 version (SF 12; physical; p [*]<[*] 0. 001 and mental; p [*]<[*] 0. 01) and in depression symptoms (p [*]<[*] 0. 01). At one-year follow-up these outcomes were maintained; additionally there was improvement in body mass index (BMI; p [*]<[*] 0. 05), and high density lipoprotein (HDL; p [*]<[*] 0. 05). There were no sex differences. Conclusion CR shared between <b>local</b> <b>and</b> <b>regional</b> health <b>authorities</b> led by a NCM (GoHeart) improves risk factors, self-care and psychosocial factors.
