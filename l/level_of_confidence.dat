If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show that most people systematically overestimate their own abilities.

5|$|Day 3 outlooks {{refer to}} the day after tomorrow, and include the same {{products}} (categorical outline, text description, and probability graph) as the Day 2 outlook. As of June 2012, the SPC forecasts general thunderstorm risk areas. Higher probability forecasts are less and less likely as the forecast period increases due to lessening forecast ability farther in advance. Day 3 moderate risks are quite rare; these have been issued only fourteen times since the product became operational (most recently for May 9, 2015). Day 3 high risks are never issued and the operational standards do not allow for such. This is most likely because it would require both a very high degree of certainty (60%) for an event which was still at least 48 hours away and a reasonable <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> that said severe thunderstorm outbreak would include significant severe weather (EF2+ tornadoes, hurricane-force winds, and/or egg-sized hail).|$|E
5|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{established}} its Yucca Mountain {{standards in}} June 2001. The storage standard set a dose limit of 15 millirem {{per year for}} the public outside the Yucca Mountain site. The disposal standards consisted of three components: an individual dose standard, a standard evaluating the impacts of human intrusion into the repository, and a groundwater protection standard. The individual-protection and human intrusion standards {{set a limit of}} 15 millirem per year to a reasonably maximally exposed individual, who would be among the most highly exposed members of the public. The groundwater protection standard is consistent with EPA's Safe Drinking Water Act standards, which the Agency applies in many situations as a pollution prevention measure. The disposal standards were to apply for a period of 10,000 years after the facility is closed. Dose assessments were to continue beyond 10,000 years and be placed in DOE's Environmental Impact Statement, but were not subject to a compliance standard. The 10,000 year period for compliance assessment is consistent with EPA's generally applicable standards developed under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. It also reflects international guidance regarding the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> that can be placed in numerical projections over very long periods of time.|$|E

25|$|Salary {{disparities between}} men and women may {{partially}} be explained by differences in negotiation tactics used by men and women. Although men and women are equally likely to initiate in a salary negotiation with employers, men will achieve higher outcomes than women by about 2% of starting salary Studies have indicated that men tend to use active negotiation tactics of directly asking for a higher salary, while women tend to use more of an indirect approach by emphasizing self-promotion tactics (e.g. explaining the motivation to be a good employee). Other research indicates that early-childhood play patterns may influence the way men and women negotiate. Men and women tend to view salary differently in terms of relative importance. Overall <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in a negotiation may also be a determinant of why men tend to achieve higher outcomes in salary negotiations. Finally, the awareness of this stereotype alone may directly cause women to achieve lower outcomes as one study indicates. Regardless of the cause, the outcome yields a disparity {{between men and}} women that contributes to the overall wage gap observed in many nations.|$|E

The purpose of the “active learning” assessment was to encourage and enhance learner autonomy. The assessment consisted of 5 main stages: a briefing, thought shower, oral business proposal presentation, a feedback stage, and Nutrition Fair. To assess learner autonomy, <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> motivation, <b>confidence,</b> and control were quantitatively and qualitatively monitored throughout the learning journey. The results showed that <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence,</b> motivation, and control increased following each stage and significantly across the learning journey. However, there were significant gender differences in terms of achievement of marks and in <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> motivation at various stages. On average, females achieved higher marks in certain assessments and they demonstrated higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> motivation after the initial briefing. Further, significant differences were also reported between different degree routes in terms of achievement <b>of</b> marks and <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence,</b> motivation, and control. “Active learning” has been shown to foster improved <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence,</b> motivation, and control in a cohort of nutrition and food students, contributing to overall learner autonomy.

40|$|This report assesses whether {{confidence}} in the New South Wales criminal justice system  has changed since 2007, whether changes in knowledge and/or punitiveness underpin any changes in confidence, and  whether {{confidence in}} police differs from {{confidence in the}} courts. Method: Repeat cross-sectional survey of the NSW public (n= 2, 002 in 2007; n= 2, 001 in 2012). The survey measured <b>confidence,</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> knowledge and public demand for harsher sentencing in both years. Logistic regression models estimated changes in confidence after accounting for changes in sample composition. In 2012, participants were also asked about confidence in the police and courts separately. Results: Participants had high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> that the CJS respects {{the rights of the}} accused and treats them fairly but lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> that the CJS brings people to justice, deals with cases promptly or meets the needs of victims. With the exception <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in respecting the rights <b>of</b> the accused, <b>confidence</b> was significantly higher in 2012 than in 2007. The 2012 respondents were also more knowledgeable about crime and justice and less punitive than the 2007 respondents. Respondents tended to have higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in the police than the courts. Conclusion: <b>Levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in the CJS have improved since 2007. Factors such as increased knowledge and decreases in punitiveness may have contributed to these increases. However the changes in all three measures could reflect other factors such as the effect of the media and public policy. While confidence in police is generally high, the public lack confidence in the expediency of the courts and in outcomes for victims...|$|R
