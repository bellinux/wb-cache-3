5|$|Among the {{folklore}} {{that has}} developed around the film over the years, there is a belief that Blade Runner cursed the companies whose logos were displayed prominently as product placement. While they were market <b>leaders</b> <b>at</b> the time, Atari, Bell, Cuisinart, and Pan Am all experienced setbacks after the film's release. The Coca-Cola Company suffered losses when it introduced New Coke in 1985, but soon regained market share.|$|E

5|$|The Sturmabteilung (SA; Storm Detachment; Brownshirts), {{founded in}} 1921, {{was the first}} {{paramilitary}} wing of the Nazi Party and their initial assignment was to protect Nazi <b>leaders</b> <b>at</b> rallies and assemblies. They also took part in street battles {{against the forces of}} rival political parties and violent actions against Jews and others. By 1934, under Ernst Röhm's leadership the SA had grown to over half a million members—4.5 million including reserves—at a time when the regular army was still limited to 100,000 men by the Versailles Treaty.|$|E
5|$|The {{county was}} further divided into districts, each {{consisting}} {{of at least}} several hamlets grouped together; typically a community of approximately one hundred families. A chief of police was assigned to each district by the county Magistrate.

5|$|A year later, when OPEC met in Vienna on 4 December 2015, the {{organization}} had exceeded its production ceiling for 18 consecutive months, US oil production had declined only slightly from its peak, world markets {{appeared to be}} oversupplied by at least 2 {{million barrels per day}} despite war-torn Libya pumping 1 million barrels below capacity, oil producers were making major adjustments to withstand prices as low as the $40s, Indonesia was rejoining the export organization, Iraqi production had surged after years of disorder, Iranian output was poised to rebound with the lifting of international sanctions, hundreds of world <b>leaders</b> <b>at</b> the Paris Climate Agreement were committing to limit carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and solar technologies were becoming steadily more competitive and prevalent. In light of all these market pressures, OPEC decided to set aside its ineffective production ceiling until the next ministerial conference in June 2016. By 20 January 2016, the OPEC Reference Basket was down to US$22.48/bbl – less than one-fourth of its high from June 2014 ($110.48), less than one-sixth of its record from July 2008 ($140.73), and back below the April 2003 starting point ($23.27) of its historic run-up.|$|E

5|$|After the 1937 Marco Polo Bridge Incident, China and Japan {{formally}} went to war. When the Kuomintang and Communist Party {{declared a}} united front to fight the Japanese, Peng was confirmed as a general in the unified command structure of the NRA. At the August 20, 1937 Lochuan Conference(洛川会议), Mao believed that the united front should {{be used as a}} feint, giving token resistance to the Japanese while saving the strength of the Red Army for the eventual confrontation with the Kuomintang, but Peng, along with most other senior military and political <b>leaders</b> <b>at</b> the time, disagreed, and believed that the Red Army should genuinely focus on fighting the Japanese. Mao was not able to force his position, and the communists cooperated with the Kuomintang and fought the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Beecham {{appointed}} Victor Olof as his orchestral manager, {{and they}} started recruiting. At {{the top of their}} list were leading musicians with whom Beecham had worked before the war. Four had been founder members of the LPO fifteen years previously: Reginald Kell (clarinet), Gerald Jackson (flute), James Bradshaw (timpani) and Jack Silvester (double-bass). From the current LPO they engaged the oboist Peter Newbury. Beecham persuaded the veteran bassoonist Archie Camden, who had been pursuing a solo career, to return to orchestral work. The cellos were led by Raymond Clark, enlisted from the BBC Symphony Orchestra. The principal horn player was Dennis Brain, who already held the same post in Legge's Philharmonia, but managed to play for both orchestras. Jenkins speculates that as Beecham knew all Britain's orchestral <b>leaders</b> <b>at</b> first hand he decided not to try to lure any of them away. His choice was John Pennington, who had been first violin of the London String Quartet from 1927 to 1934, and had then had a career in the US as concertmaster, successively, of the San Francisco Symphony, Los Angeles Philharmonic and Paramount Pictures orchestras.|$|E
5|$|Cunard, who {{was back}} in Halifax, {{unfortunately}} {{did not know of}} the tender until after the deadline. He returned to London and started negotiations with Admiral Parry, who was Cunard's good friend from when Parry was a young officer stationed in Halifax 20 years earlier. Cunard offered Parry a fortnightly service beginning in May 1840. While Cunard did not then own a steamship, he had been an investor in an earlier steamship venture, Royal William, and owned coal mines in Nova Scotia. Cunard's major backer was Robert Napier whose Robert Napier and Sons was the Royal Navy's supplier of steam engines. He also had the strong backing of Nova Scotian political <b>leaders</b> <b>at</b> the time when London needed to rebuild support in British North America after the rebellion.|$|E

5|$|Henry Clifford lived until 1523. Under {{him and his}} son– {{also called}} Henry, who later became Earl of Cumberland– the castle was {{intermittently}} in use as a residence for the family. After Brough Castle was destroyed in a fire in 1521 {{it is likely that}} Brougham became the new administrative centre and focus of the local lordship. As Earl of Cumberland Henry controlled Penrith and Carlisle, although he was an unpopular landlord. When the north of England rose up in the Pilgrimage of Grace in 1536, Henry was one of those targeted by the rebels. He confronted the rebel <b>leaders</b> <b>at</b> Kirkby Stephen in February 1537, and after his defeat he retreated to Brougham Castle. After the Pilgrimage of Grace was suppressed, there were reforms of regional government in the north west. One of the results was that the title of Earl of Cumberland no longer gave Clifford wardenship of Penrith and Carlisle, with Brougham Castle once again becoming the Cliffords' northern-most castle.|$|E
5|$|In 1804 the Lewis and Clark Expedition {{passed by}} the riverbanks where the city of Omaha would be built. Between July 30 and August 3, 1804, members of the expedition, {{including}} Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, met with Oto and Missouria tribal <b>leaders</b> <b>at</b> the Council Bluff at a point about 20miles (30km) north of present-day Omaha. Immediately south of that area, Americans built several fur trading outposts in succeeding years, including Fort Lisa in 1812; Fort Atkinson in 1819; Cabanné's Trading Post, built in 1822, and Fontenelle's Post in 1823, in what became Bellevue. There was fierce competition among fur traders until John Jacob Astor created the monopoly of the American Fur Company. The Mormons built a town called Cutler's Park {{in the area in}} 1846. While it was temporary, the settlement provided the basis for further development in the future.|$|E
5|$|In Britain {{the use of}} {{elaborate}} {{symbols of}} authority developed about 15,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic. Ivory rods, carved antlers, painted animal skulls, and other objects were buried with tribal <b>leaders</b> <b>at</b> caves in Somerset and Derbyshire. Later, around 2400BCE (BC), a group of peoples from mainland Europe known as Beaker folk conquered most of Britain. This warrior race had a tradition of investing their new leaders with polished ceremonial axes made of green quartzite, red tourmaline, and jadeite. Excavations at Bush Barrow, Wiltshire, unearthed an early example of a sceptre, decorated with bone in a zig-zag pattern, and topped by a stone. Archaeologists believe it and other treasures found in the grave may have belonged to the ruling family who built Stonehenge. By 1600 BCE, the rulers of southern Britain wore gold epaulettes, gold brooches, and gold-plated bronze daggers. A ceremonial gold cloak of the same period, the Mold cape, was found at a Bronze Age burial mound in Flintshire, Wales, in 1833.|$|E
