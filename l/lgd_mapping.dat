The accuracy and completeness of two historical {{maps of the}} same period covering the same area in Israel were examined: the 1 : 63, 360 British Palestine Exploration Fund map (1871 - 1877) and the 1 : 100, 000 French Levés en Galilée (<b>LG)</b> <b>map</b> (1870). These maps cover the mountainous area of the Galilee (northern Israel), a region with significant natural and topographical diversity, and {{a long history of}} human presence. Land-cover features from both maps, as well as the contours drawn on the <b>LG</b> <b>map,</b> were digitized. The overall correspondence between land-cover features shown on both maps was 59 % and we found that the geo-referencing method employed (transformation type and source of control points) did not significantly affect these correspondence measures. Both maps show that in the 1870 s, 35 % of the Galilee was covered by Mediterranean maquis, with less than 8 % of the area used for permanent agricultural cropland (e. g., plantations). This article presents how the reliability of the maps was assessed by using two spatial historical sources, and how land-cover classes that were mapped with lower certainty and completeness are identified. Some of the causes that led to observed differences between the maps, including mapping scale, time of year, and the interests of the surveyors, are also identified...|$|R

This tomographic inversion {{is based on the}} simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT) such as that described by Kak and Slaney (1987) in their textbook, which was introduced for early medical computer tomography (CT) usage. Here, it is used to map the Lg/Sn ratio value along a path with inversion for the local properties of the Lg wave transmission and blockage using 0.2 °[*]×[*] 0.2 ° cells. The iteration is repeated 10 times in situations where the assignment of Lg/Sn ratio value to the cells along the ray path from the hypocenter to the station, and smoothing values in the neighboring eight cells are applied to stabilize the inversion result and create a smooth reconstruction image (see Furumura and Kennett (2001) for details). This SIRT-based inversion procedure has a modest conversion rate but works well with the large sparse system associated with Lg paths. Many other least-squares inversion approaches can be used, but those require a suitable damping procedure to stabilize the results.|$|R

30|$|Regional wavefields are {{strongly}} influenced by crustal structure heterogeneity variations along their propagation paths. Observations of such effects between the Asian continent and the Japanese subduction zone across the Sea of Japan (East Sea) have been strongly assisted recently {{by the development of}} high-density seismic networks in Japan and Korea, as well as the supercomputer-based three-dimensional finite difference method seismic wave propagation simulations using detailed heterogeneous crustal models. In this study, an <b>Lg</b> propagation <b>map</b> derived from 289, 000 ray paths connecting sources to observation stations reveals efficient Lg wave propagation from continental Asia to Kyushu through the Korean Peninsula, and to Hokkaido, thus indicating a laterally consistent crustal structure extending from continental Asia to Japan. However, the Lg wave propagation to the Japanese main island of Honshu is totally blocked as it crosses the continental-oceanic boundary surrounding the Sea of Japan. Three-dimensional (3 -D) finite-difference method seismic wave propagation simulations performed using a detailed crustal structural model allow us to clearly visualize the way in which an Lg wave develops from a shallow source in the crust and its propagation in the crustal waveguide by means of multiple post-critical S wave reflections in the continental structure. The sudden thinning of the continental crust {{at the edge of the}} Asian continent adjacent to the oceanic crust in the Sea of Japan, which involves a thickness change from 30 to 10 km within a 100 -km distance (with the thinner crust extending over 600 km), decreases the Lg wave energy by 10 %. It has been confirmed that 50 % of this Lg wave energy loss occurs during wave passage along the thinner crust and that the other 50 % results from conversion into P energy in the overlying seawater.|$|R

Liquid then went on a run of its own and closed the gap to 7-5. LG got an 8th round to guarantee itself a lead by the half, but the American team made it close and took the last two rounds, making it 8-7. Liquid started well by getting the pistol round. In the next round with the score tied 8-8, FalleN was in a 1 vs 3 with the inferior sniper rifle. He quickly took down s1mple and then headshot Hiko through a wall. However, FalleN picked up a submachine gun to fight close range, but ELiGE was able to stop the clutch and Liquid went back to winning ways. Liquid extended its lead to 11-8. In the 20th round, Liquid nearly took a 12th round and rushed to the B bombsite and only FalleN was there for LG. However, {{he was able to}} stay alive and took down nitr0, allowing his team time to come over and assist him. FalleN singlehandedly put up a defense and took down Liquid with four kills and LG was able to get its first round of the second half. However, Liquid bounced back and the 11-9 scoreline became 15-9 and LG needed to force buy and came away limited. Liquid needed to win just one of the next six rounds to win the first game while LG needed to win all six rounds to force the game to overtime. coldzera would then deliver {{one of the most memorable}} plays in CSGO history. FalleN, fer, and fnx were in the A bombsite and TACO was in middle, leaving coldzera watching the apartment site of Mirage, which is near the back of the B bombsite. With about 30 seconds left, all five Liquid members went through apartments. adreN was the first to show and was taken down. coldzera then stepped down and then jumped to spot any more players. One he did, he jumped and shot with his AWP; with one bullet and not using a scope, he took down s1mple and ELiGE. Then with another no scope, he took down nitr0 who was trying to chase him down. TACO came over for support and took down Hiko. This was seen as impressive since not only hitting two at the same time was difficult, but also having no scope with the AWP and jumping makes the aim very inaccurate. Analyst Jason [...] "moses" [...] O'Toole compared it to the Immaculate Reception from the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers with Franco Harris against the Oakland Raiders since the combination of skill, luck, and other factors that needed to go coldzera's way to make it work. Valve dedicated the play with a graffiti from where the play took place. The play was a turning point in the game and LG was able to pull out the six rounds it needed to send the game to overtime. Liquid elected to go to the A bombsite, but FalleN took down ELiGE and fnx took down three more before fer found nitr0. LG continued to ride momentum and took all three rounds in the first overtime half. Liquid needed to win the other three rounds to send the game to double overtime. LG started towards the A bombsite and FalleN started by taking down ELiGE. fer took down adreN and FalleN killed nitr0 and the A bombsite was clear. Liquid pulled it back slightly when s1mple found fer and Hiko found FalleN, but coldzera caught s1mple trying to sneak in and Hiko was found by TACO on the edge of a smoke and LG pulled off the comeback. ELiGE had 27 kills for Liquid and s1mple had 24, but FalleN and coldzera had 29 kills each and LG was able to win ten rounds in a row to complete the comeback.|$|R

40|$|AbstractTransgenic {{expression}} of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crystalline (Cry) toxins by crop plants result in reduced insect feeding damage, but sustainability {{is threatened by}} the development of resistance traits in target insect populations. We investigated Bt toxin resistance trait in a laboratory colony of the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, selected for increased survival when exposed to Cry 1 Ab and correlated survival on Cry 1 Ab toxin with a constitutive ∼ 146. 2  ±  17. 3 -fold reduction in midgut aminopeptidase N 1 (apn 1) transcript levels. A 7. 1  ±  1. 9 -fold reduction apn 3 transcript level was also correlated with Cry 1 Ab resistance. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping identified a single major genome region controlling Cry 1 Ab resistance on linkage group 24 (LG 24), and a minor QTL on LG 27. Both QTL were independent of apn 1 and apn 3 loci on <b>LG</b> 02. Positional <b>mapping</b> identified genetic markers that may assist in the identification of causal gene(s) within QTL intervals. This study indicates that genetic factor(s) may act in trans to reduce both apn 1 and apn 3 expression in Cry 1 Ab resistant O.  nubilalis larvae, and suggest that gene regulatory pathways can influence Bt resistance traits. These findings show that gene interactions (epistasis) may influence Bt resistance in target insect populations...|$|R
40|$|The {{genetics}} of Striga {{resistance in}} sorghum {{has not been}} clearly demonstrated. Expression of field resistance to Striga appears to be quantitative suggesting the involvement of quantitative trait loci (QTL). However, many of these loci including the one responsible {{for the production of}} low germination stimulant (lgs) have not been mapped. The objectives of this study were to (i) construct a molecular map of the sorghum genome and to <b>map</b> the (<b>lgs)</b> gene, (ii) estimate heritability and response to selection of resistance to these two Striga species (iii) estimate genetic correlation between field resistance to these two Striga species (iv) identify and map quantitative trait loci (QTL) involved in resistance to two species of Striga in sorghum (v) compare the efficiency of predicted response to marker-based selection (MBS) and marker-assisted (MAS) selection relative to phenotypic selection for resistance to Striga. A sorghum linkage map based on one 168 RI lines and 236 molecular marker loci was constructed. The population was mapped using RAPDs, RFLPs, I-SSR and SSR markers. The estimated map size was 1628 cM, with an average interval of 9. 5 cM between adjacent loci. The <b>lgs</b> gene <b>mapped</b> 11. 8 cM from RFLP marker PI 0200725. Narrow sense heritability (h 2) of field resistance to S. asiatica was estimated at 0. 35 and that of resistance to S. hermonthica at 0. 24. Predicted response to selection for resistance to the two Striga species was the same. Significant genetic correlation (0. 52) was found between resistance to S. hermonthica and S. asiatica. Single marker analysis linking field resistance to marker data detected six QTL for resistance to S. hermonthica and five QTLs for resistance to S. asiatica. QTL detected for resistance accounted for 37 % of the variation in resistance to S. hermonthica and 49 % of the variation in resistance to S. asiatica. Interval mapping confirmed most of the QTL detected by single marker analysis. Analysis of predicted response to selection indicated that marker-based selection was 24 % more efficient in selecting for S. hermonthica and 37 % more when selecting for resistance to S. asiatica. Marker-assisted selection was 41 % more efficient in selecting for resistance to S. hermonthica and 43 % more efficient for selecting resistance to S. asiatica. ...|$|R
40|$|We have {{constructed}} the first integrated consensus map (ICM) for rose, {{based on the}} information of four diploid populations and more than 1, 000 initial markers. The single population maps are linked via 59 bridge markers, on average 8. 4 per linkage group (<b>LG).</b> The integrated <b>map</b> comprises 597 markers, 206 of which are sequence-based, distributed over a length of 530 cM on seven LGs. By using a larger effective population size and therefore higher marker density, the marker order in the ICM is more reliable than in the single population maps. This is supported by a more even marker distribution and a decrease in gap sizes in the consensus map as compared to the single population maps. This unified map establishes a standard nomenclature for rose LGs, and presents the location of important ornamental traits, such as self-incompatibility, black spot resistance (Rdr 1), scent production and recurrent blooming. In total, the consensus map includes locations for 10 phenotypic single loci, QTLs for 7 different traits and 51 ESTs or gene-based molecular markers. This consensus map combines {{for the first time the}} information for traits with high relevance for rose variety development. It will serve as a tool for selective breeding and marker assisted selection. It will benefit future efforts of the rose community to sequence the whole rose genome and will be useful for synteny studies in the Rosaceae family and especially in the section Rosoidea...|$|R
40|$|As a salt-tolerant arbor tree species, Salix matsudana {{plays an}} {{important}} role in afforestation and greening in the coastal areas of China. To select superior Salix varieties that adapt to wide saline areas, it is of paramount importance to understand and identify the mechanisms of salt-tolerance at the level of the whole genome. Here, we describe a high-density genetic linkage map of S. matsudana that represents a good coverage of the Salix genome. An intraspecific F 1 hybrid population was established by crossing the salt-sensitive "Yanjiang" variety as the female parent with the salt-tolerant " 9901 " variety as the male parent. This population, along with its parents, was genotyped by specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq), leading to 277, 333 high-quality SLAF markers. By marker analysis, we found that both the parents and offspring were tetraploid. The mean sequencing depth was 53. 20 -fold for "Yanjiang", 47. 41 -fold for " 9901 ", and 11. 02 -fold for the offspring. Of the SLAF markers detected, 42, 321 are polymorphic with sufficient quality for map construction. The final genetic map was constructed using 6, 737 SLAF markers, covering 38 linkage groups (<b>LGs).</b> The genetic <b>map</b> spanned 5, 497. 45 cM in length, with an average distance of 0. 82 cM. As a first high-density genetic map of S. matsudana constructed from salt tolerance-varying varieties, this study will provide a foundation for mapping quantitative trait loci that modulate salt tolerance and resistance in Salix and provide important references for molecular breeding of this important forest tree...|$|R

In this study, we used genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci on two mapping populations: F 31 (HLB 11 × VU 006) composed of 266 progenies and F 32 [HLB 01 × (VU 370 ×ID 316) ] composed of 292 progenies. SNP calling generated an initial set of 22, 734 SNPs for F 31 and 16, 744 for F 32. A large proportion of individuals and loci were later removed by filtering on the proportion of missing data and segregation distortions. Linkage maps were constructed with filtered SNPs in association with 14 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, using the maximum likelihood method. In both populations, loci were successfully grouped into 14 linkage groups (LGs) with an independence logarithm of odds (LOD) threshold of 11. 0 and 8. 0 for F 31 and F 32, respectively. LGs ranged in size from 90 to 15 markers for F 31 and from 92 to 12 markers for F 32. Bridge markers (459 SNPs and 9 SSRs) were identified and revealed homologous groups between families.

40|$|We {{have created}} a {{high-resolution}} linkage map of Miscanthus sinensis, using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), identifying all 19 linkage groups for the first time. The result is technically significant since Miscanthus has a very large and highly heterozygous genome, but has no or limited genomics information to date. The composite linkage map containing markers from both parental linkage maps is composed of 3, 745 SNP markers spanning 2, 396 cM on 19 linkage groups with a 0. 64 cM average resolution. Comparative genomics analyses of the M. sinensis composite linkage map to the genomes of sorghum, maize, rice, and Brachypodium distachyon indicate that sorghum has the closest syntenic relationship to Miscanthus compared to other species. The comparative results revealed that each pair of the 19 M. sinensis linkages aligned to one sorghum chromosome, except for <b>LG</b> 8, which <b>mapped</b> to two sorghum chromosomes (4 and 7), presumably due to a chromosome fusion event after genome duplication. The data also revealed several other chromosome rearrangements relative to sorghum, including two telomere-centromere inversions of the sorghum syntenic chromosome 7 in LG 8 of M. sinensis and two paracentric inversions of sorghum syntenic chromosome 4 in LG 7 and LG 8 of M. sinensis. The results clearly demonstrate, for the first time, that the diploid M. sinensis is tetraploid origin consisting of two sub-genomes.

The S-locus was previously assigned to linkage group 5 (LG 5) and linked DNA markers were identified. The loci that control leaf color and style color are linked to the S-locus. We investigated segregation for leaf and style color and S-alleles in two progenies, mapped the loci, and compared the two new <b>maps</b> with the <b>LG</b> 5 reference <b>map</b> using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Segregation for color, S-alleles and SSR markers fit expectations. The color loci and the S-locus <b>mapped</b> to <b>LG</b> 5 between SSR markers B 028 and B 774. The three maps aligned and the SSR markers were collinear. The SSR markers closest to the S-locus are KG 819, KG 847 and BR 259. In progeny 05050, which segregated for style and leaf color, no recombination was observed between the two traits. Recombination between the S-locus and the style color locus was 5. 4 cM in progeny 05050 and 10. 1 cM in progeny 00064.

The total genetic variation was partitioned into effects due to season (S), genotype (G), genotype × season interaction (G × S), and genotype × environment-within-season interaction [G × E(S) ]. QTLs were determined for traits for their G, G × S, and G × E(S) effects, to assess the magnitude and the nature (cross over/non-crossover) of environmental interaction effects on individual QTLs. QTLs for some traits were associated with G effects only, while others {{were associated with the}} effects of both G and G × S and/or G, G × S and G × E(S) effects. The major G × S QTLs detected were for flowering time (on LG 4 and <b>LG</b> 6), and <b>mapped</b> to the same intervals as G × S QTLs for several other traits (including stover yield, harvest index, biomass yield and panicle number m- 2).
