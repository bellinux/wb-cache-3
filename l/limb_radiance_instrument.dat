The goal is to produce ozone profiles with better vertical resolution than is available with the Backscattered Ultraviolet (BUV) technique and with much greater spatial and temporal coverage than with the solar occultation method (i. e. SAGE II). This method, which uses UV and visible light scattered from the earth's limb, has recently been proven to work for clear sky cases with data from the STS- 87 flight of the Shuttle Ozone Sounding Limb Experiment/Limb Ozone Retrieval Experiment (SOLSE/LORE). As to be expected, clouds have a substantial impact upon the <b>limb</b> <b>radiance</b> (increasing the radiance as much as 80 - 100 % is some cases). Here we {{use a variety of}} radiative transfer models and limited SOLSE/LORE data to investigate the effect of clouds upon the <b>limb</b> <b>radiance</b> at wavelengths used in the ozone retrieval (approximately 600 nm).

40|$|The {{monitoring}} of global ozone {{in the atmosphere}} is a necessary prerequisite to understanding atmospheric chemistry and managing atmospheric constituents. Satellite systems {{have been developed to}} measure ozone and other constituents accurately on a global basis. However, within this area there is considerable room for advancement in the techniques used to measure ozone from a satellite platform. The Canadian instrument OSIRIS onboard the Swedish-led satellite Odin contains an optical spectrograph that is used for measuring <b>limb</b> <b>radiance</b> in the atmosphere. There are various proven techniques to convert <b>limb</b> <b>radiance</b> data into ozone density profiles. This work presents a new technique that combines radiance data from both the Chappuis and Hartley-Huggins bands to retrieve ozone density. The new technique extends the current upper limit of Chappuis-only retrievals from 40 km to 60 km. The major portion of this work describes the implementation of this new technique. Briefly, a Multiplicative Algebraic Reconstructive Technique, together with the SaskTRAN radiative transfer model, is used to invert the <b>limb</b> <b>radiance</b> data into ozone density profiles. An overview of the resulting ozone density profiles is presented together with comparisons against other ozone products as a first order verification of the results.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} method for retrieving stratospheric aerosol extinction profiles from a global satellite data set. Ten years of <b>limb</b> <b>radiance</b> measurements with the instrument SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) onboard the European environmental research satellite Envisat provides the unique opportunity to derive a stratospheric aerosol extinction data set over a long time period (2002 2012) with a good global coverage on a daily basis. Stratospheric sulfate aerosols {{have a significant impact}} on climate but the determination is still subject to large uncertainties. To improve our understanding of climate relevant processes an accurate determination of stratospheric aerosol properties is crucial. Deriving stratospheric aerosol extinction from <b>limb</b> <b>radiance</b> spectra requires complicated radiative transfer calculations. An algorithm based on a color-index approach combining normalized <b>limb</b> <b>radiance</b> spectra at 470 and 750 nm is applied to retrieve aerosol extinction profiles between 12 and 35 km altitude.

40|$|The recent {{development}} of satellite observations of limb scattered sunlight at optical wavelengths has afforded a new opportunity {{to measure the}} vertical structure of atmospheric composition from the upper troposphere to the mesosphere, on a global scale. The determination of profiles of atmospheric composition from observed <b>limb</b> <b>radiance</b> profiles requires two elements, a forward radiative transfer model and a species specific inversion algorithm. In this work, {{the development of a}} new, fully spherical, successive orders radiative transfer model, SASKTRAN, for the analysis of limb scattered sunlight is presented. The model is incorporated into a novel relaxation algorithm that employs spectral ratios to retrieve profiles of stratospheric aerosols from <b>limb</b> <b>radiance</b> measurements collected by the Canadian OSIRIS instrument on the Odin satellite. The SASKTRAN forward model results compare favorably with both OSIRIS observations as well as with other radiative transfer model calculations while remaining computationally practical for the operational inversion of large satellite data sets. The spectral ratio relaxation algorithm is able to retrieve aerosol number density profiles at stratospheric altitudes from <b>limb</b> <b>radiance</b> profiles assuming the height profile of the aerosol particle size distribution is known. The equivalent aerosol extinction derived from the OSIRIS measurements at visible wavelengths agrees with coincident occultation measurements from other satellite instrumentation to within 15 % when a size distribution appropriate for background aerosol conditions is used.

The model uses the DOIT (Discrete Ordinate Iterative) method to solve the vector radiative transfer equation. The implementation of a discrete ordinate method is challenging due to the spherical geometry of the model atmosphere which {{is required for the}} simulation of <b>limb</b> <b>radiances.</b> The involved numerical issues, which are grid optimization and interpolation methods, are discussed in this paper. Scattering simulations are presented for limb- and down-looking geometries, for one-dimensional and three-dimensional spherical atmospheres. They show the impact of cloud particle size, shape, and orientation on the brightness temperatures and on the polarization of microwave radiation in the atmosphere. The cloud effect is much larger for <b>limb</b> <b>radiances</b> than for nadir radiances. Particle size is a very important parameter in all simulations. The polarization signal is negligible for simulations with completely randomly oriented particles, whereas for horizontally aligned particles with random azimuthal orientation the polarization signal is significant. Moreover, the effect of particle shape is only relevant for oriented cloud particles. The simulations show that it is essential to use a three-dimensional scattering model for inhomogeneous cloud layers. Upprättat; 2004; 20070502 (pafi...|$|R
