5|$|Twelve C-130Js are {{operated}} by No.37 Squadron, also based at Richmond under No.84 Wing. The aircraft are generally crewed by two pilots and a <b>loadmaster,</b> and are tasked with medium tactical airlift in Australia and overseas, transporting troops and cargo, and conducting medical evacuation, search-and-rescue, and airdrop missions. No.285 Squadron manages the full-flight mission simulator (FFMS) used to convert aircrew to the C-130J, {{as well as}} decommissioned Hercules airframes used for <b>loadmaster</b> training. It also employs computer-based training tools and is allocated flying aircraft from No.37 Squadron when required. As well as training aircrew new to the C-130J, the FFMS (maintained by CAE Australia) is employed for existing aircrew to maintain their currency.|$|E
5|$|As Boyd took off, another C-130 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel John Delmore {{closed in}} on Khâm Đức. At an {{altitude}} of about 300 to 400 feet, Delmore's aircraft began to receive North Vietnamese fire, and {{both sides of the}} cockpit were opened up by bullets that had ripped through the floorboards. Subsequently, just before touch down, Delmore and his co-pilot shut down the engine and forced the aircraft to remain upright. With no brakes and little directional control, the aircraft crashed into the CH-47 that had been destroyed early in the morning, but Delmore managed to turn his aircraft off the runway to avoid blocking it. When the aircraft had stopped completely, the five-man crew got out as quickly as they could. About 20 minutes later, U.S. soldiers on the ground guided them to safety, and they were rescued by a U.S. Marine CH-46. After witnessing the destruction of two C-130 Hercules, Lieutenant Colonel Franklin Montgomery landed his C-130 and extracted more than 150 Vietnamese civilians, and some CIDG and U.S. soldiers. Montgomery's aircraft suffered no hits, but the <b>loadmaster</b> was knocked down and trampled by panic-stricken Vietnamese civilians whilst trying to maintain order.|$|E
5|$|RAAF crews began {{training}} on the Hercules {{in the middle of}} 1958 at Sewart Air Force Base in Nashville, Tennessee. Much of the training took place on a simulator, augmented by approximately fifty hours flying time in the aircraft. To cope with the Hercules' complexities, the aircrew category of flight engineer, absent from the RAAF since World WarII, was reinstated. A new category, that of <b>loadmaster,</b> was also instituted; airmen performing similar duties on Dakotas had done so on an ad hoc rather than a permanent basis, without a distinct category having been formalised. A specialist crew member was needed to make weight-and-balance calculations and oversee loading and despatch for the Hercules' 20-tonne freight capacity (compared to three-and-a-half tonnes in a Dakota) and for its various cargo-delivery systems. A large hangar previously used to service seaplanes at RAAF Base Rathmines was disassembled and re-erected at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, where the C-130s would be based.|$|E
50|$|Until the 1980s, <b>loadmasters</b> {{were found}} {{primarily}} within the military, but as civilian airlines became {{more involved in}} air freight operations with large airplanes, particularly, the Boeing 747, many companies began using <b>loadmasters</b> on flights where complex cargo loads were carried.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s {{with the advent}} of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules and the {{increasing}} role of troop carrier transports in Southeast Asia, <b>loadmasters</b> were reassigned from aerial port units to troop carrier squadrons where they assumed duties previously assigned to scanners and became part of the flight crew. <b>Loadmasters</b> became extremely important in the harsh conditions of Southeast Asia, where troop carrier aircraft operated into forward airfields that were often under fire, especially after the Tet Offensive of 1968 when soldiers and Marines began calling C-123s and C-130s [...] "mortar magnets." [...] The <b>loadmaster's</b> task was to discharge the load as quickly as possible so the airplane could get off the ground to avoid incoming rocket and mortar fire. <b>Loadmasters</b> were also trained to drop flares and leaflets, and to operate retrieval equipment used in special operations aircraft.|$|R
2500|$|The NTSB {{determined}} that the probable cause of this accident was [...] "National Airlines’ inadequate procedures for restraining special cargo loads, {{which resulted in the}} <b>loadmaster’s</b> improper restraint of the cargo." [...] One of the key recommendations was to mandate training for all <b>loadmasters.</b> This has now been standardized across the cargo airlines under the Federal Aviation Administration.|$|R
5|$|At {{approximately}} 10:00, {{the runway}} at Khâm Đức was cleared of the wrecked helicopter. Moments later, a C-130 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Daryl D. Cole touched {{down on the}} runway under heavy fire, which flattened one tire and caused extensive damage to the wing tanks. Almost immediately, Cole's aircraft was rushed by hysterical Vietnamese civilians from ditches along the runway, filling the aircraft so the <b>loadmaster</b> was prevented from unloading the aircraft's cargo. Under heavy fire, Cole decided to navigate his aircraft down the cratered and shrapnel-littered runway, {{in order to take}} off. However, the combined weight of the cargo and civilians, in addition to the damage sustained during landing, prevented the aircraft from gathering enough speed to take off. So the aircrew aborted the take off, offloaded the civilians, and proceeded to cut off the blown tire to stop it from flapping and slowing down the aircraft. They were able to cut off the rubber with the bayonet, and were able to cut through the steel beading thanks to the engineers carefully cutting the steel cords with a blowtorch. A fire extinguisher was kept handy because of fear of catching the magnesium wheel on fire. About two hours later, realizing that enemy artillery rounds were coming closer to his aircraft, Colonel Cole tried to take off for the second time, and managed to get the C-130 into the air. This time his only passengers were three members of Air Force Combat Control Team (CCT), whose radio equipment had been destroyed.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, the Canadian Car & Foundry built {{a revolutionary}} new {{aircraft}} in its Montreal shops - the Burnelli CBY-3, {{also called the}} <b>Loadmaster.</b> There were two examples built of an aerofoil-fuselage design originally developed by Vincent J. Burnelli. The CBY-3 was never to enter full-scale production and was cancelled {{less than one year}} later.|$|E
25|$|The WC-130J {{employs a}} {{standard}} five person crew {{element of a}} pilot, co-pilot, Combat Systems Officer (CSO), aerial reconnaissance weather officer (ARWO), and a weather loadmaster/dropsonde operator, with a second <b>loadmaster</b> assigned when required. The ARWO is the flight meteorologist and acts as flight director inside the storm system. Operational crews train twice monthly at Keesler AFB and fly weather recon missions when available. 53d WRS pilots and loadmasters go through their initial C-130J training at the 314th Airlift Wing's tactical airlift training center at Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas. CSOs and ARWOs from the 53d WRS have no formal school and train in-house at Keesler utilizing an Air Education and Training Command-approved syllabus for their specialized mission training.|$|E

500|$|No. 12 Squadron was re-raised at Amberley on 3 September 1973 {{to operate}} the Chinooks. This unit had flown bombers between 1939 and 1948 before being renumbered No. 1 Squadron. The twelve CH-47s were transported from the United States to Australia on board the {{aircraft}} carrier , and were unloaded at Brisbane on 28 March 1974. In April that year {{it was reported that}} six of the helicopters were to be placed in storage as a cost-saving measure; as of 1979 these aircraft had still not been flown. No. 12 Squadron began conducting training flights on 8 July 1974, and the unit was declared operational in December the next year. The squadron typically had between four and six CH-47Cs operational at any time throughout the type's service, the fleet being rotated through long-term storage at RAAF Base Amberley as planned. The CH-47Cs had a crew of four, comprising two pilots, a <b>loadmaster</b> and one other, and could transport up to 33 passengers or [...] of cargo.|$|E
500|$|The Australian Government ordered twelve C-130J Super Hercules in December 1995 and {{deliveries}} began during 1999. As part of {{the deal}} negotiated with Lockheed Martin, seven of the RAAF's C-130Es were transferred to the company in return for a reduced price on the new aircraft. At the time the order for the twelve C-130Js was placed, the Government also took out options for a further twenty-seven Super Hercules, but these were not taken up; the options included seven airborne early warning and control and eight aerial refuelling variants, as well as up to eight transports for the Royal New Zealand Air Force. The RAAF was the first operator of this C-130 variant, which was larger than earlier models and had a crew of only three (two pilots and a <b>loadmaster)</b> eliminating the navigator and flight engineer roles employed in earlier models. The aircraft initially suffered from serious mechanical and software problems as well as a shortage of spare parts, and were assessed as [...] "experiencing significant operational shortfalls" [...] in a 2002 Australian National Audit Office report. The Defence Science and Technology Organisation undertook considerable research into the C-130J design and developed improvements to the aircraft that addressed problems with excessive vibration. The 2009 Defence white paper [...] called for the acquisition of two more C-130Js to partially replace the H variants. This purchase did not go ahead, as the government instead ordered a fifth Boeing C-17 GlobemasterIII.|$|E
500|$|Arthur Adams {{was born}} on April 5, 1963 in Holyoke, Massachusetts. His father was a <b>loadmaster</b> in the United States Air Force, and as a result, Adams {{frequently}} moved with his parents and four younger brothers to places that included West Virginia. When Adams was five years old, the family settled in Vacaville, California, near Travis Air Force Base. Adams' first exposure to superhero and monster comics came through the ones his mother would buy for him once a month at a thrift store. His enthusiasm for superhero stories by particular creators began when his father returned from an overseas trip with the first Marvel Treasury Grab-Bag, which included stories by Ross Andru, Wally Wood, and Gene Colan. He particularly liked Marvel Comics for their stories with monster-like characters like the Thing, the Hulk, and the Man-Thing. He became interested in dinosaurs and monsters like King Kong after watching Creature Features on TV every Saturday, and Universal Monster movies such as Frankenstein and Creature from the Black Lagoon. He also enjoyed superhero and science fiction programming, such as Super Friends, the 1967 Spider-Man cartoon and Star Trek. Adams enjoyed drawing frequently in his youth, {{as far back as}} he could remember. He discovered the work of Frank Frazetta when he was 13 or 14, which was a [...] "huge" [...] early influence on him, and attempted to mimic his style using watercolor. Adams did not consider illustration as a profession, however, as he aspired to be a paleontologist. His interest in professional paleontology waned, however, when he realized that the extreme climates of the environments in which he would be required to work were not appealing to him.|$|E
