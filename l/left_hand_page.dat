The depiction of an unclothed woman was considered pornographic when the book was first released in the United States, and created a controversy around the book.

Of particular significance are the documented works of the scholars, Al Khawarizmy and Al Mazendarany in 976 which show receipts recorded on the right hand page and payments on the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>page,</b> with conditions to exclude later tampering.

25|$|The {{notebook}} Kid receives {{already has}} writing throughout, {{but only on}} the right <b>hand</b> <b>pages.</b> The <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>pages</b> are blank. Glimpses of the text in the notebook, however, are extremely close to passages in Dhalgren itself, as if the notebook were an alternate draft of the novel. Other passages are verbatim from the final chapter of Dhalgren. It is here in Chapter II that Kid begins using the blank pages of the notebook to compose poems. The novel describes {{the process of creating}} the poems—the emotions and the mechanics of the writing itself—at length and several times. We never see the actual poems, however, in their final form. Kid soon revises or removes any line that does appear in the text.|$|R
50|$|Black and White {{is a book}} by David Macaulay. Released by Houghton Mifflin, it was the {{recipient}} of the Caldecott Medal for illustration in 1991. The book contains four different illustrated stories told at once, two on the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>page</b> and two on the right. Each story has a distinct artistic style; however, they all share similar characters, themes and plot elements leading the reader to believe that the four stories {{may or may not be}} one story told from different points of view. The overall effect is rather similar to that of the film Rashomon.|$|E

50|$|Imitation plays a {{large role}} in children's lives; in order to pick up skills and {{techniques}} that they use in their own life, children are always searching for behaviours and attitudes around them that they can co-opt. Children are aware of their position in the social hierarchy from a young age: their instinct is to defer to adults' judgements and majority opinions. Similar to the Asch conformity experiments, a study done on groups of preschool children showed that they were influenced by groups of their peers to change their opinion to a demonstrably wrong one. Each child was handed a book with two sets of images on each page, with a groups of differently sized animals on the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>page</b> and one animal on the right hand, and each child was asked to indicate the size of the lone animal. All the books appeared the same, but the last child would sometimes get a book that was different. The children reported their size judgements in turn, and the child being tested was asked last. Before him or her, however, were a group of children working in conjunction with the researchers. Sometimes, the children who answered before the test subject all gave an answer that was incorrect. When asked {{in the presence of the}} other children, the last child's response was often the same as his or her peers. However, when allowed to privately share their responses with a researcher the children proved much more resistant to their peers' pressure, illustrating the importance of the physical presence of their peers in shaping their opinions.|$|E

40|$|They do not {{apprehend}} how {{being at}} variance it agrees with itself: {{there is a}} back-stretched connexion, as in the bow and the lyre ”- Heraklitos. 1 Metaphor, as Jan Zwicky has argued, is the basic form {{our understanding of the}} world takes, writing how, “To mean is always in some measure, to carry across: meta pherin ” (2003 : 51), following the logic of what she calls “seeing-as”: “I am interested in the phenomenon of ‘seeing-as ’ because it encapsulates the mystery of meaning. The moment of recognition happens as if by magic; and yet, when we reflect on it, we see – its very name tells us this – that it is impossible without prior experience. What becomes puzzling then is the phenomenon of insight, the crea-tion (apparently) of new meaning. Here, we forget that to recognise can mean to re-think, as in think through dif-ferently. It need not always signify mere repetition of a former cognition”, (2003 : 1). Zwicky’s sense of understanding entails the passing of something already experienced being perceived in rela-tion to something else and in this carrying across there occurs: “an act of contextualisation, a sensing of connexions between aspects of immediate experience and other experiences ” (2003 : 1). Metaphor, for Zwicky, speaks to the spatiality of understanding that is inflected with time. Simply by placing things beside each other, a burgeoning realisation can dawn. Such is the form Zwicky’s own philosophical text Metaphor and Wisdom takes, where a quotation occupying the right-hand page is accompanied on the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>page</b> by a short but dense philosophica...|$|E

When the patient was indicating what fabric was in the <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> he was able to correctly indicate and point with the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> to the wire screen after it had been set on a table. As he pointed with his <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> however, the right hand tried to stop the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> and make the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> point to the fabric that the right hand was holding. The <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> continued to point at the correct fabric, even though the right hand tried to forcefully move the <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> During the struggle, the patient also verbalized feelings of animosity by saying, “That’s wrong!” and “I hate this hand”.
