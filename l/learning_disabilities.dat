5|$|Paradoxical reactions, such as {{increased}} seizures in epileptics, aggression, violence, impulsivity, irritability and suicidal behavior sometimes occur.

However, they occur with greater frequency in recreational abusers, individuals with borderline personality disorder, children, and patients on high-dosage regimes.

The stories focussed upon in this study were identified in a series of 20 audio taped teaching sessions with student <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> nurses. The research investigations centred upon the <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> constructions in some 30 stories and were also supported by 5 subsequent interviews with the teachers and observations of 7 teaching sessions. The findings highlight some interesting ideas about the social construction of <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> by nurse educators and also the personal tensions expressed by <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> nurses trained in the past but faced with the dominant discourses of today. As a qualitative study, this research drew upon the ideas of social construction and competing discourses most commonly associated with Michael Foucault in his works Discipline and Punish and Madness and Civilisation. In particular the stories were investigated for the influences of medicalising and professionalising discourses which construct people with <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> as powerless and the <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> nurse with the power to control. The investigations began with a form of Foucauldian discourse analysis which was used to examine the transcribed storied material, interviews and observations. Following initial engagement the investigations also developed with the aid of discourse analysis more heavily influenced by the discursive psychology of Potter and Wetherell (2004). Both forms of discourse analysis assisted the investigation of the many ways or modes in which <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> was constructed by nurse teachers.

5|$|Although {{there was}} a {{consensus}} {{in the scientific community}} about how it was possible for the brain's neural circuitry to change through experience, the potential effect of web technologies on the brain's neural circuitry was unknown. On the topic of the Internet's effect on reading skills, Guinevere F. Eden, director of the Center for the Study of Learning at Georgetown University, remarked that the question was whether or not the Internet changed the brain {{in a way that was}} beneficial to an individual. Carr believed that the effect of the Internet on cognition was detrimental, weakening the ability to concentrate and contemplate. Olds cited the potential benefits of computer software that specifically targets <b>learning</b> <b>disabilities,</b> stating that among some neuroscientists {{there was a}} belief that neuroplasticity-based software was beneficial in improving receptive language disorders. Olds mentioned neuroscientist Michael Merzenich, who had formed several companies with his peers in which neuroplasticity-based computer programs had been developed to improve the cognitive functioning of kids, adults and the elderly. In 1996, Merzenich and his peers had started a company called Scientific Learning in which neuroplastic research had been used to develop a computer training program called Fast ForWord that offered seven brain exercises that improved language impairments and <b>learning</b> <b>disabilities</b> in children. Feedback on Fast ForWord showed that these brain exercises even had benefits for autistic children, an unexpected spillover effect that Merzenich has attempted to harness by developing a modification of Fast ForWord specifically designed for autism. At a subsequent company that Merzenich started called Posit Science, Fast ForWord-like brain exercises and other techniques were developed with the aim of sharpening the brains of elderly people by retaining the plasticity of their brains.|$|E

Stereotypical views about the sexuality of people with <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> range from asexuality, implying that they have no erotic or romantic inclinations, to hyper-sexuality which reinforces institutionalized sex segregation through the process of social exclusion. In Malta all these influences contribute to hinder the rights and {{the quality of life of}} people with <b>learning</b> <b>disability.</b> The theory of the social model of disability underpins the research aims, while reflecting discourses of equality and rights. The research aims at giving a better understanding of the sexual lives of people with <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> in a Maltese context, whilst eliciting the opinions and beliefs of people with <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> themselves, their parents and their service providers. Qualitative data, collected from people with <b>learning</b> <b>disability,</b> their I' parents and service providers is interpreted using phenomenological analysis. A sex education intervention pilot project is also run as part of the research, being informed by the findings of the same research.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} whether staff training improved knowledge about the defining criteria for <b>learning</b> <b>disability,</b> knowledge about the management of challenging behaviour, attributions about challenging behaviour and confidence in working with children with a <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> and challenging behaviour in teaching staff from mainstream primary school settings. In addition, the study aimed to investigate if staff training improved teaching staff’s attitudes towards the inclusion of children with a <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> and challenging behaviour in mainstream settings. A further investigation into {{whether the number of}} years experience of teaching children with a <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> positively affected their levels of confidence in working with and knowledge about children with a <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> and challenging behaviour. METHOD: A within subjects design was used to investigate the impact of a half-day training event on the above factors in a group of 40 teaching staff from mainstream primary school settings. A questionnaire devised for the purposes of assessing the study’s hypotheses and the Impact of Inclusion Questionnaire (IIQ) were employed in this study and completed by participants prior to training, immediately after training and one-month following training. RESULTS: Staff training was shown to significantly improve knowledge about the defining criteria for <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> immediately after training and at one-month follow-up. Training, however, did not significantly improve knowledge about challenging behaviour immediately after training although some significant differences were found at follow up. Significant differences in the types of answers provided at each time point were found {{in a number of areas}} related to knowledge about challenging behaviour. Training did not significantly change attitudes towards the inclusion of children with a <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> and challenging behaviour in mainstream settings and did not significantly improve confidence about working with children with a <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> and challenging behaviour. No significant relationship was found between experience of teaching children with a <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> and confidence about working with children with a <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> and challenging behaviour, knowledge about the defining criteria for <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> or knowledge about managing challenging behaviour. CONCLUSION: A half-day training event about <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> and challenging behaviour significantly improved knowledge about the defining criteria for <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> but had little impact on increasing knowledge about challenging behaviour in a group of mainstream teaching staff. Teaching staff demonstrated very limited knowledge about <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> prior to training and demonstrated negative attributions about the causes of challenging behaviour in children with a <b>learning</b> <b>disability,</b> the latter of which was not improved by training. Training also failed to improve attitudes towards inclusion and possible reasons for the current study’s significant and non-significant results are discussed. The clinical and ethical implications of the findings are discussed and suggestions for further research are outlined. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
