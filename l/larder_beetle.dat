5|$|Books are {{sometimes}} attacked by cockroaches, silverfish, book mites, booklice, and various beetles which {{feed on the}} covers, paper, bindings and glue. They leave behind physical damage {{in the form of}} tiny holes as well as staining from their faeces. Book pests include the <b>larder</b> <b>beetle,</b> and the larvae of the black carpet beetle and the drugstore beetle which attack leather-bound books, while the common clothes moth and the brown house moth attack cloth bindings. These attacks are largely a problem with historic books, because modern bookbinding materials are less susceptible to this type of damage.|$|E

[...] Several insects were found on the body: larval Fannia canicularis (Little House Fly), larval Muscina stabulans (False Stable Fly), and adult Dermestes lardarius (<b>Larder</b> <b>Beetle).</b> [...] Fannia are drawn to feces and urine, and their presence is strong evidence of neglect. The woman probably had not changed clothes or bathed in some time. [...] She had developed pressure spots where her head had been resting on her chest for long periods of time.

50|$|Dermestes maculatus, {{known as}} the hide beetle, leather beetle, or skin beetle, feeds on raw skins and hides like the <b>larder</b> <b>beetle.</b> This species is similar in {{appearance}} to the <b>larder</b> <b>beetle,</b> with short and long reddish brown or black setae, but its two spine-like posterior appendages curve forward. Also, the forewings are dark brown and the sternum is mostly white with some black. Its life cycle is 60 to 70 days and the female can lay up to 800 eggs.|$|E

50|$|Dermestes ater, also {{occasionally}} called Dermestes haemorrhoidalis, is {{a species}} of beetle in the family Dermestidae, the skin beetles. It is known commonly as the black <b>larder</b> <b>beetle</b> or incinerator beetle. It is native to North America, but today it is found nearly worldwide. Like several other dermestid beetles, this species is familiar as a common pest of stored products.|$|E
50|$|Household fibers, such as {{wool and}} silk, are {{especially}} prone to moth damage and special cleaning, which includes moth proofing, {{needs to be}} done frequently. Application of insecticides must be by spot treatment to crack and crevice sites where they are suspected of hiding. Pyrethrins are labeled for use against hide beetles. Insecticides used for carpet beetles are also appropriate to use against hide and <b>larder</b> <b>beetles.</b>|$|R

40|$|Dermestid beetles are in {{the family}} Dermestidae and order Coleoptera. These beetles are {{sometimes}} called <b>larder</b> <b>beetles</b> or carpet beetles. Adults range from 1 to 12 mm in length and have variable body coloration. In general, they are hairy, dark-colored, elongated, and have clubbed antennae. The larvae are light brown and can be up to 13 mm long. Many larvae have spines, called setae, {{on the back of}} the abdomen that are helpful with identification.

50|$|Actual book-borers are uncommon. Two moths, {{the common}} clothes moth and the brown house moth, will attack cloth bindings. Leather-bound books attract various beetles, such as the <b>larder</b> <b>beetle</b> and the larva of the black carpet beetle and Stegobium paniceum. Larval death watch beetles and common {{furniture}} beetles will tunnel through wood and paper (if it is nearby the wood).|$|E
50|$|Dermestes lardarius, {{commonly}} known as the <b>larder</b> <b>beetle,</b> is a species of beetle in the family Dermestidae, the skin beetles. It is found worldwide. It is a common pest of households and storage facilities ("larders") in much of the world. It eats animal products, such as dried meats and fish, pet food, skins and hides, feathers, cheese, and museum specimens such as dried insects. It may also eat plant material that is high in protein, such as grain.|$|E
50|$|Dermestidae are {{a family}} of Coleoptera that are {{commonly}} referred to as skin beetles. Other common names include <b>larder</b> <b>beetle,</b> hide or leather beetles, carpet beetles, and khapra beetles. There are approximately 500 to 700 species worldwide. They can range in size from 1 to 12 mm. Key characteristics for adults are round oval shaped bodies covered in scales or setae. The (usually) clubbed antennae fit into deep grooves. The hind femora also fit into recesses of the coxa. Larvae are scarabaeiform and also have setae.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{methods of}} meat slaughtering, storage, and {{distribution}} have reduced potential infestations of hide beetles. Proper housekeeping {{is crucial for}} the prevention of infestations. Dead insects in homes usually attract these beetles because they are a prime food source for hide and <b>larder</b> <b>beetles.</b> Food must be tightly sealed or stored in a refrigerator to avoid any beetle access. Freezing food for a week or heating meat in a pan or microwave for prolonged lengths can kill insects found in infested foods and prevent them from spreading.|$|R
50|$|Proper {{examination}} of the object is an initial step in the conservation process. Technologies, such as Radiography and reflectography, are most commonly used. Radiography tends to provide the effective technique in terms of analyzing the condition and preservation work done {{on the structure of}} panel paintings. Other uses of radiography can be seen by the opaqueness of specific colors used in the painting, condition of the wood, thickness or density of the wood, and various damage done by pests.Furniture and <b>Larder</b> <b>Beetles</b> can burrow into wood. Illustrations of these beetles can be found through the Insects Limited Incorporated Museum page. Other examples can be found through Museumpests.net's Identification page.|$|R
50|$|Pollenia rudis is most {{commonly}} {{known for being}} a household nuisance. The first reports of cluster flies as pests in homes occurred {{as early as the}} nineteenth century, and these flies continue to cause problems today. Cluster flies tend to enter homes and buildings in large masses in late summer or early autumn to seek shelter for the winter months. They possess the ability to squeeze their bodies through any exterior crevices of a home, such as cracks around windows and doors, air conditioning vents, screening vents, and loosely hung siding. Once cluster flies enter a home, they usually hibernate in inaccessible areas between walls and in ceilings until spring when they emerge and seek access to the outdoors. P. rudis is extremely troublesome to home and business owners, but does not cause any true damage to home structures, textiles, foods, or humans. Piles of dead flies left in the walls can sometimes lead to secondary infestations of carpet or <b>larder</b> <b>beetles</b> and rodents.|$|R

50|$|Adult larder beetles are {{generally}} 1/3 to 3/8 {{of an inch}} long and are dark brown with a broad, pale yellow spotted band across the upper portion of the elytra. There are three black dots arranged in a triangle shape on each wing. The sternum and legs of the <b>larder</b> <b>beetle</b> are covered in fine, yellow setae. Adult larder beetles are typically found outdoors in protected areas during the winter, but during the {{spring and early summer}} they enter buildings. Females lay approximately 135 eggs near a food source, and the eggs will hatch in about 12 days. The life cycle of larder beetles lasts around 40 to 50 days.|$|E

40|$|Dry cured hams {{often become}} infested with {{arthropod}} pests during the aging process, which include ham mites, Tyrophagus putrescentiae, red-legged ham beetles, Necrobia rufipes, cheese skippers, Piophila casei, and <b>larder</b> <b>beetles,</b> Dermestes lardarius. Methyl bromide {{has been used}} to fumigate dry cured ham plants and is the only known fumigant that is effective at eradiating ham mite infestations at this time (EPA, 2010). However, methyl bromide is classified as a Class 1 ozone depletion substance and will be phased out for all industries by 2015 (EPA, 2006). A survey of 34 dry cured ham indicated that 22 of plants surveyed used methyl bromide fumigation one to five times a year based on the severity of the infestation (Rentfrow, et al., 2008). It is crucial for the dry cured ham industry to discover and research potential alternatives to methyl bromide. Phosphine is considered to be the most widely used fumigant alternative for methyl bromide (Fields and White, 2002) due to its easy application, effectiveness, low cost and lack of residue (Zuryn et al., 2008). The density of phosphine is 1. 17 times that of air and it is a gas at above- 88 °C, which makes it disperse easily during fumigation (Nath et al., 2011). Phosphine works as a strong reducing agent in the mitochondrial electro...|$|R

40|$|Forensic {{entomology}} is {{a branch}} of entomology used to solve mainly human criminal offences. In {{the last few years}} the entomological approach is more and more often applied in forensic cases involving animals or problems of a veterinary nature. Several studies on insect colonisation have been performed using pig (Sus scrofa) as a model for humans. Pigs and humans differ from the majority of the other mammals {{because of the lack of}} dense fur. Little information, concerning the effect of the fur on insect colonisation, is available. The aim of this pilot work is to investigate the effects of fur, season and fur*season on the colonisation of animal carrions by insects. Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) are used as a model for animals with fur. Five experiments have been performed during 2011 in a field in the neighbourhood of Modena (Northern Italy) (one in winter, one in spring, one in summer and two in autumn). For each test, two rabbits (2, 5 - 4, 5 Kg) have been used, one with fur and one without. The carrion without fur had been considered as control. Calliphora vicina, Lucilia sericata and Lucilia illustris have been the fly species collected. Hymenoptera parasitoids and <b>larder</b> <b>beetles</b> (Dermestes undulatus) have been also collected. No difference in the composition of the fly fauna colonizing the carrions has been detected in any of the performed experiments. In contrast, a delay in colonization of the animals with fur have been registered in all the experiments. This delay was bigger during the colder seasons. The fauna composition is clearly different comparing warmer and colder seasons. This data further confirms the different phenology of the genera Lucilia and Calliphora in Northern Italy...|$|R
