5|$|A {{potential}} {{obstacle to}} the adoption of biological pest control measures is growers sticking to the familiar use of pesticides. However, pesticides have a variety of undesired effects, including the development of resistance among pests, and the destruction of natural enemies; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests of other species than the ones originally targeted, and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides. One method of increasing grower adoption of biocontrol methods involves letting them <b>learn</b> <b>by</b> doing, for example showing them simple field experiments, enabling them to observe the live predation of pests, or demonstrations of parasitised pests. In the Philippines, early season sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice, but growers were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb' of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting; participation in this resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use.|$|E
5|$|The tip of {{the tongue}} {{probably}} acts as a suction cup and during lapping, nectar may be drawn up the proboscis by capillary action. When at rest or flying, the proboscis is kept folded under the head. The longer the tongue, the deeper the bumblebee can probe into a flower and bees probably <b>learn</b> <b>by</b> experience which flower source is best-suited to their tongue length. Bees with shorter proboscides, like Bombus bifarius, have a more difficult time foraging nectar relative to other bumblebees with longer proboscides; to overcome this disadvantage, B. bifarius workers were observed to lick the back of spurs on the nectar duct, {{which resulted in a}} small reward.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} dynamic {{economic}} model with wealth accumulation and human capital accumulation. The economic system consists of one production sector and one education sector. We {{take account of}} three ways of improving human capital: <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> producing, <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> education, and <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> consuming. The model describes a dynamic interdependence between wealth accumulation, human capital accumulation, and division of labor under perfect competition. We simulate the model to demonstrate existence of equilibrium points and motion of the dynamic system. We also examine effects {{of changes in the}} propensity to receive education, efficiency of learning, and efficiency of education upon dynamic paths of the system.

40|$|<b>Learning</b> <b>by</b> erasing {{means the}} process of {{eliminating}} potential hypotheses from further consideration thereby converging to the least hypothesis never eliminated and this one must be {{a solution to the}} actual learning problem. The present paper deals with learnability by erasing of indexed families $L$ of languages from both positive data as well as positive and negative data. This refers to the following scenario. A family $L$ of target languages and a hypothesis space for it are specified. The learner is fed eventually all positive examples (all labeled examples) of an unknown target language L chosen from $L$. The target language L is <b>learned</b> <b>by</b> erasing if the learner erases some set of possible hypotheses and the least hypothesis never erased correctly describes L. The capabilities of <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> erasing are investigated in dependence on the requirement of what sets of hypotheses have to be or may be, erased, and in dependence of the choice of the hypothesis space. Class preserving <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> erasing ($L$ has to be learned w. r. t. some suitably chosen enumeration of all and only the languages from $L$), class comprising <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> erasing ($L$ has to be learned w. r. t. some hypothesis space containing at least all the languages from $L$), and absolute <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> erasing ($L$ has to be learned w. r. t. all class preserving hypothesis spaces for $L$) are distinguished. For all these models of <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> erasing necessary and sufficient conditions for learnability are presented. A complete picture of all separations and coincidences of the <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> erasing models is derived. <b>Learning</b> <b>by</b> erasing is compared with standard models of language learning such as learning in the limit, finite learning and learning without overgeneralization. The exact location of these types within the hierarchy of the <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> erasing models is established...|$|R

40|$|Background: New {{competencies}} may {{be learned}} through active experience (<b>learning</b> <b>by</b> doing) or observation of others’ experience (<b>learning</b> <b>by</b> observation). Observing another person performing a complex action accelerates the observer’s {{acquisition of the}} same action, limiting the time-consuming process of <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> doing. Here, we compared <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> observation and <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> doing in individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). It is hypothesized that PWS individuals could show more difficulties with <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> observation than <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> doing because of their specific difficulty in interpreting and using social information. Methods: The performance of 24 PWS individuals was {{compared with that of}} 28 mental age (MA) - and gender-matched typically developing (TD) children in tasks of learning a visuo-motor sequence by observation or by doing. To determinewhether the performance pattern exhibited by PWS participants was specific to this population or whether it was a nonspecific intellectual disability effect, we compared the PWS performances with those of a third MA- and gender-matched group of individuals with Williams syndrome (WS). Results: PWS individuals were severely impaired in detecting a sequence by observation, were able to detect a sequence by doing, and became as efficient as TD children in reproducing an observed sequence after a task of <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> doing. The <b>learning</b> pattern of PWS children was reversed compared with that of WS individuals. Conclusions: The observational learning deficit in PWS individuals may be rooted, at least partially, in their incapacity to understand and/or use social information...|$|R

25|$|From behaviourists such as B. F. Skinner {{come the}} {{learning}} theories, which state that complex behaviour is learned gradually through the modification of simpler behaviours.

As each simple behaviour is established through imitation and subsequent reinforcement, the complex behaviour develops.
