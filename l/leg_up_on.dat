25|$|ABC {{cemented}} {{its reputation}} as a youth-oriented network in daytime {{with the addition of}} One Life to Live to its schedule, with {{much of the rest of}} its lineup consisting of soap operas like Dark Shadows, sitcom reruns, and game shows packaged by Chuck Barris. One Life to Live replaced the short-lived Baby Game, in a three-way shuffle with Dark Shadows and Dating Game. The network placed the new serial at 3:30 PM EST, against CBS's established hit Edge of Night and the popular NBC game You Don't Say. Despite the tough competition, the intense tone of the plot and strong characters allowed the show to get a <b>leg</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> You Don't Say, wearing that game down to the point of its cancellation in September 1969; NBC replaced the Tom Kennedy-hosted game in that time slot with three unsuccessful serials: Bright Promise, Return to Peyton Place, and How to Survive a Marriage.|$|E

500|$|On November 11 (with UT {{holding an}} 8-1 record) Heisman voter Rodney Gilmore of ESPN.com had McCoy listed third of five Heisman candidates. Gilmore said, [...] "I love his numbers (78 percent {{completion}} percentage, 28 touchdowns, only 7 interceptions and 2,879 yards) and his gutsy second-half performance against Texas Tech. And I have not forgotten about his epic performance against Oklahoma {{just a few}} weeks ago. However, Harrell outplayed McCoy head-to-head in the showdown last week, so Harrell has a <b>leg</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> him for now, but McCoy is within striking distance." [...] That same day, the Rocky Mountain News poll listed Harrell first and McCoy second in their weekly poll of 10 Heisman voters.

Adam Graham of Central Michigan Life commented that [...] "although the show was only about 10 songs long and the authenticity of her voice was in question throughout, it was really truly hard to walk away feeling anything but completely gratified". Dave Tianen of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel believed that the show [...] "was energetic, good-humored, fast-paced and bright". During the tour, accusations of lip synching arose. Spears talked to Rolling Stone about the accusations, saying: ...|$|E
500|$|The musical {{performances}} and selection in the episode {{were met with}} mixed response from critics. The original track [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] received general acclaim from critics. Berk praised the performance, and gave it four stars. He opined, [...] "All four stars are for the lyrics [...] in which the lovable dorks sing about being the lovable dorks {{we fell in love}} with [...] ". In her review for the episode, Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone praised the song, and called it a [...] "true anthem" [...] that [...] "ends triumphantly". Raymond Flandez of The Wall Street Journal gave a positive review of the song: [...] "The song grew out of a collaborative brainstorming session that went beyond rhyming dictionaries or first attempts at ditties such as 'Trouty Mouth', 'Big Ass Heart', and 'Hell to the No'." [...] Jarrett Wieselman of the New York Post commended the show for the use of original songs, and wrote [...] "Glee entered uncharted territory last night [...] no, not Kurt's first kiss. I'm talking about New Directions dabbling in, and debuting, their very first original songs. It was as risky for the show as it was for the group since opting to perform wholly new creations would either give them a <b>leg</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the competition or put them six feet under." [...] Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle praised the song, and deemed it [...] "fun and summery".|$|E

2500|$|Upon its release, Last Train to Paris {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 75, based on 13 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Simon Vozick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly said [...] "Last Train to Pariss glittery grooves feel authentically his own." [...] He called Last Train {{a throwback to}} Diddy's 2007 hit single [...] "Last Night". It's the [...] "electro-laced torch duet blown out to full album length". He concluded by saying [...] "the sheer number of cameos overwhelms the narrative conceit after a while... But who really cares? By that time, you just might be enjoying yourself way too much to notice." [...] Jim Farber of New York Daily News was impressed with Dirty Money's contribution to the album. He said [...] "their input gives the CD a cohesion otherwise disrupted by Diddy's usual conga line of guest stars." [...] He {{pointed out that the}} album takes on a Eurodance sound and although people might see it as [...] "leaping on that bandwagon but as it turns out, the milieu proves a much better fit for his, er, talents, than any CD he has released so far." [...] Farber concluded by saying [...] "The Euro edge gives the music a <b>leg</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the more conservative (read: American) dance music favored by the most mainstream club act of now -- those ever mushy Peas." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent noted Dirty Money's [...] "emphasis on emotion over purely dance imperatives" [...] and dubbed the album [...] "easily the best work Diddy's been involved with in his entire career."

2500|$|Regardless of controversy, five films at Universal — The Black Cat, The Raven, The Invisible Ray, Son of Frankenstein, Black Friday (plus minor cameo {{performances}} in 1934's Gift of Gab) and two at RKO Pictures, You'll Find Out and The Body Snatcher — paired Lugosi with Boris Karloff. Despite the relative {{size of their}} roles, Lugosi inevitably got second billing, below Karloff. There are contradictory reports of Lugosi's attitude toward Karloff, some claiming that he was openly resentful of Karloff's long-term success and ability to get good roles beyond the horror arena, while others suggested the two actors were — for a time, at least — good friends. Karloff himself in interviews suggested that Lugosi was initially mistrustful of him when they acted together, believing that the Englishman would attempt to upstage him. When this proved {{not to be the}} case, according to Karloff, Lugosi settled down and they worked together amicably (though some have further commented that Karloff's on-set demand to break from filming for mid-afternoon tea annoyed Lugosi). Karloff also insinuated that his iconic rival could not act, claiming Lugosi had [...] "never learned his trade". Universal did cast Lugosi in a couple of heroic parts, as in The Black Cat after Karloff had been accorded the more colorful role of the villain, The Invisible Ray, and a romantic role in the adventure serial The Return of Chandu, but his typecasting problem appears to have been too entrenched to be alleviated by those films. Of course, Karloff had a <b>leg</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Lugosi simply by being a native English speaker; Lugosi had to learn English as a second language, and was never able to shed his heavy accent.|$|E
