25|$|In 1947, Columbia Pictures offered Hellman a multi-year {{contract}}, {{which she}} refused because the contract included a <b>loyalty</b> <b>clause</b> that she {{viewed as an}} infringement on her rights of free speech and association. It required her to sign a statement {{that she had never}} {{been a member of the}} Communist Party and would not associate with radicals or subversives, which would have required her to end her life with Hammett. Shortly thereafter, William Wyler told her he was unable to hire her to work on a film because she was blacklisted.|$|E

This was a <b>loyalty</b> <b>clause</b> that the Bengals created and added to Pickens's {{contract}} which would cause him to forfeit all or some of his signing bonus if he insulted the organization in public. This clause has since been used in contracts with other players.|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} loyalty shares (LS) and {{multiple}} voting shares (MVS) {{is based on}} different rationales. LS are designed as an ECM for listed companies. MVS are an incentive to list the private owned companies. Although there are some inconsistencies in the recent law that allowed the issue of these classes, the criticism is mainly {{based on the assumption}} that voting rights and power shall be measurable with the risk. Special classes of shares allowed by the civil code deny this assumption and do allow obstacle pyramidal groups or other leverages. Second, LS strengthen the relationship between one of the shareholder (not necessarily the majority) and the directors. Third, considering the ownership structure of Italian companies and recent scandals, it is unclear if the long term shareholder is more efficient in terms of protection of the other investors. The second part of the essay is devoted to certain interpretation issues related to LS (inter alia, exit rights from the company in the event the <b>loyalty</b> <b>clauses</b> are amended; enhanced voting rights in relation to certain topics of the agenda of the shareholder meeting; change of control of the loyal shareholder; pre-emption right; loyalty shares and pledge). In relation to MVS, inter alia, topics discussed are the combination of <b>loyalty</b> <b>clauses</b> and MVS is discussed and the feasibility of MVS in relation to the appointment of directors. Lastly, it is discussed whether the introduction of MVS does not give any right to withdraw from the company to conclude that such a right does not exist...|$|R
40|$|Contracts between {{suppliers}} and customers frequently contain provisions rewarding the customer for exhibiting loyalty to the seller. For example, suppliers may offer customers preferential pricing for buying a specified percentage of their requirements from the supplier or buying minimum numbers of products across multiple product lines. Such loyalty-inducing contracts have come under attack on antitrust grounds because of their potential to foreclose competitors or soften competition by enabling tacit collusion among suppliers. This article defends loyalty inducement as a commercial practice. Although it can be anticompetitive under some circumstances, rewarding loyal customers is usually procompetitive and price- reducing. The two most severe attacks on loyalty discounting—that loyalty discounts are often disguised disloyalty penalties and that <b>loyalty</b> <b>clauses</b> soften competition—are unlikely to hold as a general matter. Nor are arguments that customers only accede to loyalty inducements because of collective action problems generally true. Dominant buyers who face few collective action problems frequently use loyalty commitments to leverage their buying power and obtain lower prices...|$|R
