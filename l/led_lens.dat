40|$|In this study, a {{procedure}} for optimization of an <b>LED</b> <b>lens</b> module design based on 3 LED light sources {{was divided into}} two phases. For preliminary optimization of {{the dimensions of the}} <b>LED</b> <b>lens</b> module in Stage I, an optical analysis with orthogonal arrays and TracePro (an optical design package) combined with analysis of variance was conducted to investigate relationships between the multiple optical quality characteristics (viewing angle and average illuminance) and dimension parameters and find the initial optimal parameter combination of the <b>LED</b> <b>lens</b> module. In Stage II, the initial optimal parameter combination determined in Stage I was employed to develop an orthogonal array L- 25 (5 (6)) for optical simulation. The experimental data of the orthogonal array were used to train and test the back-propagation neural network to develop an optical quality predictor, which was integrated into the genetic algorithms and the particle swarm optimization in order to find the optimal parameter combination that conformed to optical quality. From the experimental results, the proposed optimization procedure contributes to a precise viewing angle to achieve the goal of optical quality and improved the average illuminance in development of the product. The procedure to optimize the optical design developed in this study can be applied to design all types of <b>LED</b> <b>lens</b> modules and improve the optical design and technology of the <b>LED</b> <b>lens</b> industry...|$|E
40|$|Traditional LED (light {{emitting}} diode) packaging always adopts hemisphere lens, and {{can ensure}} high light output efficiency, but its radiation pattern yields Lambert distribution and is non-uniformity. To enable LED light sources {{be applied in}} uniform illumination system, a method to obtain freeform <b>LED</b> <b>lens</b> based on energy equipartition and tangent iteration is proposed. Firstly, according to the Lambertian distribution of LED light intensity and its rotationally symmetric peculiarity, the LED emission angle is divided into N parts in Two-dimensional coordinate system, and the energy contained in each part is equal; Secondly, the target plane is divided into N equal areas along its radii, and the discrete points are corresponding to the N parts of emission angle. So that if the energy in each divided solid angle is controlled to illuminate the equal divided area, the illumination of each corresponding micro-belt on the target plane will be uniform; Finally, to avoid the total reflection of large emission angle rays, the designed lens will refract the rays with 0 ∼ 450 emission angle and reflect the rays with 450 ∼ 900 emission angle. Choosing an initial point on the freeform generatrix, and using Snell equation and tangent iteration method, the coordinates of all points on the freeform generatrix are obtained, which could be rotated into the freeform surface of the lens. The simulation results using the designed <b>LED</b> <b>lens</b> show that for a rotationally symmetric target plane the illumination uniformity is near to 90 % and the energy efficiency is higher than 95 %...|$|E
40|$|Three-dimensional heat transfer-curing {{simulation}} {{was performed}} for the curing process by introducing {{a large area}} compression molding for simultaneous forming and mass production for the lens and encapsulants in the LED molding process.

The temperature deviation between each lens cavity could be reduced by implementing a simulation model on the large area compression mold and by optimizing the location of heat source. A two-step cure cycle was constructed to reduce excessive reaction peak at the initial stage and cycle time. An optimum cure cycle that could reduce cycle time by more than 29 % compared to a one-step cure cycle by adjusting dwell temperature, heating rate, and dwell time was proposed. It was thus confirmed that an optimization of large area <b>LED</b> <b>lens</b> molding process was possible by using the present experiment and the finite element method...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} to {{investigate}} the optimization of mechanical properties for the maximum tensile strength, elongation, and impact strength of Polycarbonate and Polymethyl methacrylate (PC/PMMA) blends by injection molding process. The PC/PMMA plastics composites with different blending percentage are first blended have been injected as the tensile and impact specimens designed according to ASTM, type V by injection molding machine. Taguchi’s method is then used to find the optimal parameters for the maximum tensile strength, elongation and impact strength. The control factors selected {{in this study are}} melt temperature, packing pressure, mold temperature and cooling time. An ANOVA table has been used for determining the significance of injection molding parameters. Results of experiments show that the melt temperature is the most significant parameter for improvement of mechanical properties of PC-PMMA plastics composites. Blends with high PC concentrations result in low tensile strength and high impact strength. Illumination testing of the tatol internal reflection (TIR) of PC/PMMA blends has been proceeded and the TIR lens illumination intensity is compared with three compositions of the PC/PMMA blends. Illumination results show that the PC/PMMA 80 / 20 blend has the highest intensity of illumination.

40|$|Radiant power {{emitted by}} high power {{light-emitting}} diodes (LEDs) have been steadily increasing {{over the past}} decade. High radiation, especially short wavelength, can increase the temperature and negatively affect the primary lens performance of high-power LEDs. In this regards, assessment of lens temperature during operation is important. Past studies have shown large errors when thermocouples are used for measuring temperature in high radiant flux environments. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to understand the problem in using thermocouples to measure <b>LED</b> <b>lens</b> surface temperature and to find a solution to improving the measurement accuracy. A laboratory study was conducted to better understand the issue. Results showed that most of the error is due to absorption of visible radiant energy by the thermocouple. In this study, the measurements made using an infrared (IR) thermal imaging system were used as the reference temperature because the IR imaging system is unaffected by radiant flux in the visible range. After studying the thermocouple wire metallurgy and its radiation absorption properties, a suitable material was identified to shield the thermocouple from visible radiation. Additionally, a silicone elastomer was used to maintain the thermal interface between the lens surface and the thermocouple junction bead. With these precautions, the lens temperature measurements made using the J-type thermocouple and the IR imaging system matched very well...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a moldless stack {{dispensing}} method {{to form an}} <b>LED</b> <b>lens</b> at the wafer level is presented. This method uses a dispensing process to form a lens with high H/L ratio, where H and L stand for the height and the base length of the lens. Silicon wafer is used as the substrate. V-groove trenches are made {{on the surface of}} the wafer to define the size of the substrates. In the dispensing process a droplet of encapsulant is dispensed on the substrate to form a base heap. After the base heap is cured, a second droplet of encapsulant is dispensed on top of the base heap and cured. The stacked encapsulant forms a lens with high H/L ratio. Dispensing on substrates sized from 3 mm × 3 mm to 5 mm × 5 mm is investigated. For each size of substrate, experiments are performed to obtain the maximum volume of the encapsulant without overflowing (the critical volume) for both the base heap and the stacked layer. The results show that despite size differences, substrates of different sizes have a similar critical volume for both the base heap and the stacked layer. The ratio of critical volume of base heap to stacked layer remains at around 1 / 1. Consequently, the highest H/L values of substrates with different sizes stay at around 0. 33. Both critical k and H/L show no obvious correlation to the size of substrate. © 2014 JIEP...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} whether gait alterations due to monocular spherical lens blur were a safety strategy or driven by lens magnification. METHODS: Adaptive gait and visual function were measured in 10 older adults (mean age, 74. 9 ± 4. 8 years) with the participants' optimal refractive correction and when monocularly blurred with ± 1. 00 DS and ± 2. 00 DS lens over the dominant eye. Adaptive gait measurements {{for the lead}} and trail foot included foot position before the raised surface, toe clearance of the raised surface edge, and foot position on the raised surface. Vision measurements included binocular visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and stereoacuity. RESULTS: Equal levels of monocular positive and negative spherical <b>lens</b> blur <b>led</b> to very different stepping strategies when negotiating a raised surface. Positive blur <b>lenses</b> <b>led</b> to an increased vertical toe clearance and reduced distance of the lead foot position on the raised surface. Negative <b>lenses</b> <b>led</b> to the opposite of these changes. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that step negotiation strategies were driven by the magnification effect provided by the spherical lenses. Steps appeared closer and larger with magnification from positive lenses and further away and smaller with minification from negative lenses and gait was adjusted accordingly. These results suggest that previously reported adaptive gait changes to monocular spherical lens blur were not safety strategies as previously suggested but driven by lens magnification.

40|$|Multiple softwares were {{required}} in the traditional design process of <b>LED</b> free-form surface <b>lens.</b> It is obvious that this process is complicated and inefficient. Moreover, when the model was transferred from 3 D modeling software to optical simulation software, the file format had to be changed {{to solve the problem}} of the software compatibility. Note that some subtle changes were inevitably introduced to the model by such an operation, such as the generation of cracks or tiny deformation which would seriously affect the light efficiency and the degree of illumination uniformity. A new design method was presented in this paper which was used to directly generate model in the optical simulation software by using Scheme language. In this paper, the method of mesh division was applied to design the <b>LED</b> free-form surface <b>lens</b> with rectangular lighting. After the corresponding surface configuration was obtained, 3 D modeling software and the Scheme language programming were used to generate lens model respectively. With the help of optical simulation software, a light source with the size of 1 mm in diameter was used in experiment, in which total one million rays were computed. The simulated results could be acquired by both models. It can be seen that the model deformation problems caused by the process of the model transfer could be prevented by using Scheme language, and the degree of illumination uniformity was also increased from 67 % to 93. 5 %.
