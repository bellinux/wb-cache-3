5|$|<b>Last</b> <b>Night</b> in Twisted River took 20 {{years to}} {{conceive}} and write, {{and is a}} story within a story that shows {{the development of a}} novelist and the writing process. It uses many of the themes and plot devices that have already seen treatment in other works by the author. The career of the novelist in the book closely tracks the career of Irving himself, making it Irving's most overtly autobiographical novel.|$|E

His suicide note claimed that the sexual encounter had been consensual and that the youth contacted police only after Fashanu refused to pay him blackmail.|$|E
5|$|You made me very low-spirited <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> by your {{manner of}} talking—You are my only friend—the only person I am {{intimate}} with.—I {{never had a}} father, or a brother—you have been both to me, ever since I knew you—yet I have sometimes been very petulant.—I have been thinking of those instances of ill-humour and quickness, and they appeared like crimes.

5|$|During his {{association}} with the Duo-Art company between 1915 and 1932, Grainger made around 80 piano rolls {{of his own and}} others' music using a wooden robot designed to play a concert grand piano via an array of precision mechanical fingers and feet; replayings of many of these rolls have subsequently been recorded on to compact disc. This reproduction system allowed Grainger to make a posthumous appearance in the Albert Hall, London, during the 1988 <b>last</b> <b>night</b> of the Proms as soloist with the BBC Symphony Orchestra in Grieg's Piano Concerto.|$|E
5|$|Ketèlbey's {{popularity}} {{began to}} wane during the Second World War and his originality also declined; {{many of his}} post-war works were re-workings of older pieces and he increasingly found his music ignored by the BBC. In 1949 {{he moved to the}} Isle of Wight, where he spent his retirement, and he died at home in obscurity. His work has been reappraised since his death; in a 2003 poll by the BBC radio programme Your Hundred Best Tunes, Bells Across the Meadows was voted the 36th most popular tune of all time and the <b>last</b> <b>night</b> of the 2009 Proms season marked the fiftieth anniversary of Ketèlbey's death—the first time his music had been included in the festival's finale.|$|E
5|$|The next day, August 24, the 23rd Infantry {{continued}} {{clearing the}} rear areas and by night it {{estimated that there}} were fewer than 200 North Koreans behind the forward positions. The Bowling Alley front was quiet during the day. Shortly after midnight on August 24 the North Koreans launched what had by now become their regular nightly attack down the Bowling Alley. This attack was in an estimated two-company strength supported by a few tanks. The 27th Infantry broke up the attack and two more North Korean tanks were destroyed by the supporting artillery fire. This was the <b>last</b> <b>night</b> the 27th Infantry Regiment spent in the Bowling Alley.|$|E

5|$|We {{believe the}} enemy has {{undoubtedly}} suffered a crushing defeat. We thank Admiral Kinkaid for his intervention yesterday.

To them the men of Cactus lift their battered helmets in deepest admiration.|$|E
5|$|After many delays, the General and {{his party}} arrive in Honda, where the Governor, Posada Gutiérrez, has {{arranged}} for three days of fiestas. On his <b>last</b> <b>night</b> in Honda, the General returns late to camp and finds one of his old friends, Miranda Lyndsay, waiting for him. The General recalls that fifteen years ago, she had learned of a plot against his life and had saved him. The following morning, the General begins the voyage down the Magdalena River. Both his physical debilitation and pride are evident as he negotiates the slope to the dock: he {{is in need of}} a sedan chair but refuses to use it. The group stays a night in Puerto Real, where the General claims he sees a woman singing during the night. His aides-de-camp and the watchman conduct a search, but they fail to uncover any sign of a woman having been in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Both yes–no {{questions}} and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (Am I going tomorrow?, Where can we eat?), which may require do-support (Do you like her?, Where did he go?). In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) {{appear in a}} fronted position. For example, in the question What did you see?, the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose house did you go <b>last</b> <b>night?.</b> The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.|$|E
