Musically, the piece had a restrained dance beat, very Mowtownish, that owed a <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> gospel, with a chorus - sung by Mariah, Trey and Patrique - that rose gloriously from the verse to repeat and drive and its very positive message home.|$|E

Between 1989 and 2003 {{they were the}} most leftwing voters in the Netherlands, often a <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> the left than voters of the SP. These voters are in favor of the redistribution of wealth, free choice for euthanasia, opening the borders for asylum seekers, the multicultural society and are firmly against building new nuclear plants.|$|E

25|$|Well-known {{streets in}} Rotterdam are the Lijnbaan (the {{first set of}} {{pedestrian}} streets of the country, opened in 1953), the Hoogstraat, the Coolsingel with the city hall, and the Weena, which runs from the Central Station to the Hofplein (square). A modern shopping venue is the Beurstraverse ("Stock Exchange Traverse"), better known by its informal name 'Koopgoot' ('Buying/Shopping Gutter', after its subterranean position), which crosses the Coolsingel below street level). The Kruiskade is a more upscale shopping street, with retailers like Michael Kors, 7 For All Mankind, Calvin Klein, Hugo Boss, Tommy Hilfiger and the Dutch well known men's clothier Oger. Another upscale shopping venue is a flagship store of department store De Bijenkorf. Located a <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> the east is the Markthal, with lots of small retailers inside. This hall {{is also one of}} Rotterdam's famous architectural landmarks.|$|E
500|$|In 1834 Bennett was {{appointed}} organist of St Ann's, Wandsworth, London, a chapel of ease to Wandsworth parish church. He held the post for a year, {{after which he}} taught private students in central London and at schools in Edmonton and Hendon. Although by common consent the RAM had <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> teach him after his seventh or eighth year, he was permitted to remain as a free boarder there until 1836, which suited him well, as his income was small. In May 1835 Bennett made his first appearance at the Philharmonic Society of London, playing the premiere of his Second Piano Concerto (in E-flat major, Op. 4), and {{in the following year}} he gave there the premiere of his Third Concerto (in C minor, Op. 9). Bennett was {{also a member of the}} Society of British Musicians, founded in 1834 to promote specifically British musicians and compositions. Davison wrote in 1834 that Bennett's overture named for Lord Byron's Parisina was [...] "the best thing that has been played at the Society's concerts".|$|E

He also resolved a significant number-theory problem formulated by Waring in 1770. [...] As with the finiteness theorem, he used an existence proof that shows there must be solutions for the problem rather than providing a mechanism to produce the answers. [...] He then had <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> publish on the subject; but the emergence of Hilbert modular forms in the dissertation of a student means his name is further attached to a major area.|$|E

2500|$|Some Finegan detractors {{believe he}} did <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> {{contribute}} to the Confederate victory at Olustee than to shuttle troops forward to General Alfred H. Colquitt of Georgia, whom they credit for thwarting the Federal advance. They point out that Finegan was quickly relieved of his command over the state troops, replaced by Major General James Patton Anderson. But this change in command was necessary as Finegan was ordered to lead the [...] "Florida Brigade" [...] in the Army of Northern Virginia, where he served effectively until {{near the end of}} the war.|$|E

In 2011 it introduced new widebody aircraft to compete with Qantas on Perth–Melbourne–Sydney services; and the concurrent introduction of business class in January 2012; together with a new livery and renaming of the brand to Virgin Australia.|$|E
2500|$|As {{long as the}} A's {{were winning}} games and filling the park, the 20th Street {{entrepreneurs}} were annoying, but <b>little</b> <b>more,</b> <b>to</b> Mack and the Shibes, but that changed in the early 1930s. Starting in 1932, Mack's sell-off of his Second Dynasty stars, combined with general Great Depression hard times, sent attendance plummeting. 20th Streeters, accustomed to the income but now suffering from the tough economy like everyone else, sent reps to the lines – such as they were – at the park box office to offer discount seats and poach customers from the ball club. This {{was the last straw}} for Jack Shibe. In the winter of 1934–35, he ordered the fence raised to 34 feet. While the fence-raising was Jack Shibe's idea, it became generally known as [...] "Connie Mack's Spite Fence."

2500|$|By this time, {{the growing}} Order of friars {{was divided into}} provinces and groups were sent to France, Germany, Hungary, and Spain and to the East. Upon {{receiving}} {{a report of the}} martyrdom of five brothers in Morocco, Francis returned to Italy via Venice. Cardinal Ugolino di Conti was then nominated by the Pope as the protector of the Order. Another reason for Francis' return to Italy was that the Franciscan Order had grown at an unprecedented rate compared to prior religious orders, but its organizational sophistication had not kept up with this growth and had <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> govern it than Francis' example and simple rule. To address this problem, Francis prepared a new and more detailed Rule, the [...] "First Rule" [...] or [...] "Rule Without a Papal Bull" [...] (Regula prima, Regula non bullata), which again asserted devotion to poverty and the apostolic life. However, it also introduced greater institutional structure though this was never officially endorsed by the pope.|$|E
2500|$|From {{a modern}} {{historical}} perspective, when tracing tàijíquán's formative influences to Taoist and Buddhist monasteries, there seems <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> go on than legendary tales. Nevertheless, some traditional schools claim that tàijíquán has a practical connection to and dependence upon {{the theories of}} Song dynasty Neo-Confucianism (a conscious synthesis of Taoist, Buddhist, and Confucian traditions, especially the teachings of Mencius). These schools believe that tàijíquán's theories and practice were formulated by the Taoist monk Zhang Sanfeng in the 12th century, {{at about the same}} time that the principles of the Neo-Confucian school were making themselves felt in Chinese intellectual life. However, modern research casts serious doubts on the validity of those claims, pointing out that a 17th-century piece called [...] "Epitaph for Wang Zhengnan" [...] (1669), composed by Huang Zongxi (1610–1695), is the earliest reference indicating any connection between Zhang Sanfeng and martial arts whatsoever, and must not be taken literally but must be understood as a political metaphor instead. Claims of connections between tàijíquán and Zhang Sanfeng appeared no earlier than the 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|Freeman first {{wrote about}} the Conquest {{while he was still}} a student at Oxford, where his 1846 essay [...] "The Effects of the Conquest of England by the Normans" [...] was {{submitted}} for, but failed to win, a prize. [...] In 1859 and 1865 he published lengthy reviews of the last two volumes of Sir Francis Palgrave's History of Normandy and of England. [...] Exploring his points of agreement and disagreement with Palgrave Freeman decided to embark on his own history of the Conquest, reasoning that its approaching 800th anniversary might well make such a work popular. [...] He believed that he had so completely worked out his own position on the historical controversies involved that [...] "there will be <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> do than write down what is already in my head". [...] He began work on the History on 7 December 1865, writing to a friend that it was a book [...] "which I can do easier than anybody else, as I have worked so much at the subject for twenty years past". [...] In the event, Freeman's decision to trace the remoter causes of the Conquest in much greater detail than he had originally planned put paid to all hopes of bringing his history down to William the Conqueror's accession in time for the octocentenary. [...] His first volume, taking the story as far as the death of Harthacnut, appeared in 1867; subsequent volumes in 1868, 1869 and 1871 dealt with the reigns of Edward the Confessor, Harold Godwinson and William the Conqueror respectively; and an 1876 volume explored the consequences of the Conquest in later reigns, with a final index volume in 1879. [...] Freeman later issued two revised editions.|$|E
