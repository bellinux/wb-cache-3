40|$|Resistance to <b>gall</b> <b>mite</b> is an {{important}} genetic trait of Ribes. P and Ce genes, responsible for <b>gall</b> <b>mite</b> resistance, were established in Ribes species and interspecific hybrids using molecular markers. Resistance in R. americanum is determined by P gene and in R. sanguineum by Ce gene. Both molecular markers were absent in R. dikuscha genome. Molecular markers related to P and Ce genes were identified in the genome of R. aureum. Resistance to <b>gall</b> <b>mite</b> in the field conditions in R. nigrum x R. americanum, R. nigrum x R. aureum and R. nigrum x R. sanguineum F 3 hybrids fitted an expected Mendelian segregation ratio of 1 : 1, 3 : 1 and 1 : 1, respectively. 75. 0 % of hybrids with a pyramidal resistance to <b>gall</b> <b>mite</b> carrying markers related to Ce and P genes were obtained in the cross combination R. nigrum x R. aureum and {{will be included in}} the future breeding programs...|$|R

40|$|The {{blackcurrant}} <b>gall</b> <b>mite</b> (Cecidophyopsis ribis) is {{the most}} important pest of blackcurrant crops. Over recent years withdrawal from plant protection programmes of chemical products (endosulfan and amitraz) used for the control of this pest in Poland, has led to an observed increase in population numbers. In 2013, fenpiroxymate (Ortus 05 SC) became registered for control of this pest. It is deemed best that chemical protection should be used during the migration period; when big <b>gall</b> <b>mites</b> emerge from buds in search of new buds. The studies were carried out in a plantation of blackcurrants during 2011 - 2013. The assessment of migration of the blackcurrant <b>gall</b> <b>mite</b> was carried out on the cultivars ‘Ben Hope’, ‘Ben Alde’r, ‘Ojeby’n and ‘Ruben’. Every year, from selected cultivars buds were collected. They were then placed on blackcurrant leaves within Petri dishes. After one, three and five days of placing buds on the leaves, the estimated number of eriophyid mites on the leaves was calculated. The data has shown a very useful method for monitoring blackcurrant <b>gall</b> <b>mite,</b> which can be used in calculating the treatment dates for this pest. Also, the data has shown that differences in the periods of migration of the mite are dependent on the cultivar and time of flowering. Among the cultivars observed the least susceptible to colonization by the blackcurrant <b>gall</b> <b>mite</b> was a Polish cultivar ‘Ruben’, while the most susceptible cultivar was ‘Ben Hope’...|$|R
50|$|The {{sycamore}} <b>gall</b> <b>mite</b> Eriophyes macrorhynchus produces {{small red}} galls, {{similar to those}} of the nail <b>gall</b> <b>mite</b> Eriophyes tiliae, on leaves of sycamore and field maple, Acer campestris from April onwards. Another mite, Aceria pseudoplatani causes a 'sycamore felt gall' on the underside of leaves of both sycamore and Norway maple (Acer platanoides). The sycamore aphid Drepanosiphum platanoidis sucks sap from buds and foliage, producing large quantities of sticky honeydew that contaminate foliage, cars and garden furniture beneath.|$|R
