Our design exploits the strong bias towards zero at the bit level exhibited by the memory value stream of ordinary programs.

40|$|In {{this work}} a novel family of {{asymmetric}} dual-Vt Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) cell designs that reduce leakage power in caches while maintaining low access latency is introduced. The asymmetrical cell family {{is built on}} the following premise: select a preferred stored value and weaken, by increasing the threshold voltage, only those transistors necessary to drastically reduce leakage when this value is stored. The designs exploit the strong bias towards zero at the bit level exhibited by the memory values of ordinary programs. Relative to conventional symmetric high-performance cells, the asymmetric cells offer significant leakage reduction in the zero state {{and in some cases}} also in the one state albeit to a lesser extent. A unique sense-amplifier, in combination with dummy bitlines, enables read times to be comparable to conventional symmetric cells.

40|$|Abstract Storing {{and sharing}} {{databases}} {{in the cloud}} of computers raise serious concern of individual privacy. We consider two kinds of privacy risk: presence <b>leakage,</b> <b>by</b> which the attackers can explicitly identify individuals in (or not in) the database, and association <b>leakage,</b> <b>by</b> which the attackers can unambiguously associate individuals with sensitive information. However, the existing privacy-preserving data sharing techniques either fail to protect the presence privacy or incur considerable amounts of information loss. In this paper, we propose a novel technique, Ambiguity, to protect both presence privacy and association privacy with low information loss. We formally define the privacy model and quantify the privacy guarantee of Ambiguity against both presence leakage and association leakage. We prove both theoretically and empirically that the information loss of Ambiguity is always less than the classic generalization-based anonymization technique. We further propose an improved scheme, PriView, that can achieve better information loss than Ambiguity. We propose efficient algorithms to construct both Ambiguity and PriView schemes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of both Ambiguity and PriView schemes...|$|R
