40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{performance}} of a forced-liquid Vertical Tubular <b>Loop</b> <b>Bioreactor</b> (VTLB), a forced-liquid Horizontal Tubular <b>Loop</b> <b>Bioreactor</b> (HTLB) and a gas-induced External Airlift <b>Loop</b> <b>Bioreactor</b> (EALB) were compared for production of biomass from natural gas. Hydrodynamic characteristics and mass transfer coefficients were determined as functions of design parameters, physical properties of gases as well as operational parameters. Moreover, energy consumption for different gas and liquid flow rates was studied. In the EALB, kinematic viscosity (g) showed its significant role on mixing time, gas hold-up and kLa and the diffusion coefficient of gas in water (Dg) had a remarkable effect on kLa. It was observed from experimental results that the {{performance of}} the VTLB was the best for biomass production. Furthermore, the volumetric mass transfer coefficients for air and methane were determined at different geometrical and operational factors. New correlations for mixing time, gas hold-up and kLa were obtained and expressed separately. Also, the different ratios of methane and air were measured and compared for optimum growth in the VTLB, HTLB and EALB.

40|$|Microbubble {{generation}} by a novel fluidic oscillator driven {{approach is}} analyzed, {{with a view}} to identifying the key design elements and their differences from standard approaches to airlift <b>loop</b> <b>bioreactor</b> design. The microbubble generation mechanism has been shown to achieve high mass transfer rates by the decrease of the bubble diameter, by hydrodynamic stabilization that avoids coalescence increasing the bubble diameter, and by longer residence times offsetting slower convection. The fluidic oscillator approach also decreases the friction losses in pipe networks and in nozzles/diffusers due to boundary layer disruption, so there is actually an energetic consumption savings in using this approach over steady flow. These dual advantages make the microbubble generation approach a promising component of a novel airlift <b>loop</b> <b>bioreactor</b> whose design is presented here. The equipment, control system for flow and temperature, and the optimization of the nozzle bank for the gas distribution system are presented. (C) 2009 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

The impact of CO 2 mass transfer on Dunaliella salina growth is assessed, through vary ing the gas (5 % CO 2, 95 % N 2) dosing flow rate. The results showed that approximately 6 - 8 times higher chlorophyll content was achieved in the aerated ALB cultures than in the non-aerated flasks, {{and there was a}} 20 % - 40 % increase in specific growth rate of D. salina in the novel ALB with microbubbles when compared with the conventional ALB cul tures. The increase in chlorophyll content was found to be proportional to the total amount of CO 2 mass transfer. For the same dosing time and flow rate, higher CO 2 mass transfer rate (microbubble dosing) resulted in a greater growth rate. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{scaling up}} and {{downstream}} processing costs of biofuels from microalgae are major concerns. This study focuses on reducing the cost by using energy efficient methods {{in the production}} of microalgae biomass and the downstream processes (biomass harvesting and lipid extraction). Ozonation of Dunaliella salina (green alga) and Halomonas (Gram-negative bacterium) mixed cultures for 10 min at 8 mg/L resulted in a reduction in the bacterial contaminant without harming the microalga. Harvesting of D. salina cells through microflotation resulted in a 93. 4 % recovery efficiency. Ozonation of the harvested microalgal cells for 60 min produced three main saturated hydrocarbon compounds (2 -pentadecanone, 6, 10, 14 -trimethyl; hexadecanoic acid; octadecanoic acid) consisting of 16 to 18 carbons. By systematically switching the carrier gas from CO 2 to O 3, the microbubble-driven airlift <b>loop</b> <b>bioreactor</b> (ALB) delivers nutrient to the culture and in-situ disinfection respectively. Further, modulating the bubble size to match particle size ensures recovery of the cells after culture.

These cycles {{were used to}} simulate the light regime experienced by micro-algae in externally-illuminated (sunlight) air-lift <b>loop</b> <b>bioreactors</b> with internal draft tube. Biomass yield in relation to light energy was determined as g protein per mol of photons (400 - 700 nm). Between 600 and 1200 ?mol m^- 2 s^- 1 the yield at a 10 / 5 s light/dark cycle was equal to the yield at continuous illumination. Consequently, provided that the liquid circulation time is 15 s, a considerable dark zone seems to be allowed {{in the interior of}} air-lift loop photobioreactors (33 ␟/v) without loss of light utilization efficiency. However, at a 5 / 10 s light/dark cycle, corresponding to a 67 ␟/v dark zone, biomass yield decreased. Furthermore, both algae, C. reinhardtii and D. tertiolecta, responded similarly to these cycles with respect to biomass yield. This was interesting because they were reported to exhibit a different photoacclimation strategy. Finally, it was demonstrated that D. tertiolecta was much more efficient at low (average) photon flux densities (57 - 370 ?mol m^- 2 s^- 1) than at high PFDs (> 600 ?mol m^- 2 s^- 1) and it was shown that D. tertiolecta was cultivated at a sub-optimal temperature (20 ^°C) ...|$|R

40|$|Yeast {{requires}} and consumes a {{high amount}} of oxygen rapidly during growth. Maintaining yeast cultures under sufficient aeration, however, {{is a significant}} challenge in yeast propagation. Due to their high surface area, microbubbles are more efficient in mass transfer than coarse bubbles. The performance of an airlift <b>loop</b> <b>bioreactor</b> equipped with a fluidic oscillator generated microbubbles in yeast propagation is presented here. The approach is compared with a conventional bubble generation method that produces coarse bubbles. Dosing with microbubbles transferred more oxygen to the cultures, achieving non-zero dissolved O 2 levels and consequently, eliminating the starvation state of yeast in contrast to coarse bubble sparging. The average cell growth yield obtained under microbubble sparging reached 0. 31  mg/h (± 0. 02) while 0. 22  mg/h (± 0. 01) was recorded for cells grown with coarse bubbles during the log phase.

The definitive version is available at: [URL] study was conducted to test the feasibility of growing microalgae on steel plant exhaust gas, generated from the combustion of offgases from steel processing, which has a high CO content. Two field trials of batch algal biomass growth, mediated by microbubble transfer processes in an airlift <b>loop</b> <b>bioreactor</b> showed only steady growth of biomass with 100 % survival rate. The gas analysis of CO uptake in the 2200 L bioreactor showed a specific uptake rate of 0. 1 g/L/h, an average 14 % of the CO available in the exhaust gas with a 23 % composition of CO. This uptake led to a steady production of chlorophyll and total lipid constituency in the bioreactor, and an accelerating exponential growth rate of biomass, with a top doubling time of 1. 8 days. The gas analysis also showed anti-correlation of CO uptake and O production, which along with the apparent stripping of the O to the equilibrium level by the microbubbles, strongly suggests that the bioreactor is not mass transfer limited, nor O inhibited.

40|$|ABSTRACTOPTIMIZATION OF ENGINEERED HEART VALVE TISSUE EXTRACELLULAR MATRIXGeorge Carl Engelmayr, Jr., PhDUniversity of Pittsburgh, 2005 Prosthetic heart valves, whether biologically-derived or mechanical, have {{improved}} {{the quality of}} life of millions of patients worldwide since their introduction in the 1960 's. However, while currently available prosthetic valves perform sufficiently well in the short term, the side-effects of anticoagulation therapy (mechanical valves) and the structural degeneration of bioprosthetic and allograft valves represent significant drawbacks in the long-term. The limitations of these non-viable devices are especially pronounced in pediatric patients suffering from congenital valvular lesions, as none of the current prosthetic valves have the capacity to grow in tandem with the somatic growth of the patient. Tissue engineered heart valves (TEHV) are conceptually appealing for use in the surgical repair of valvular lesions because they harbor a living cell population potentially capable of orchestrating tissue self-repair, growth, and resistance to infection. Since the mid- 1990 's, significant progress has been made toward the development of a functional TEHV, culminating in long-term implantation studies in sheep. In these previous studies, TEHV were constructed by seeding vascular-derived smooth muscle and endothelial cells, or bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC), onto bioresorbable polymer scaffolds. The resultant TEHV were subsequently cultivated in a pulsatile flow <b>loop</b> <b>bioreactor</b> in which TEHV could be exposed to graduated increases in mechanical stimulation prior to implantation. Importantly, it was demonstrated through these previous studies that mechanical stimulation is critical to the development of a functional TEHV. In the absence of mechanical stimulation, TEHV exhibited significantly reduced extracellular matrix (ECM) formation, and thus upon scaffold degradation retained insufficient structural integrity for acute hemodynamic function. However, because the various mechanical stimuli (e. g., cyclic flexure, tension, and fluid flow) were coupled in the pulsatile flow <b>loop</b> <b>bioreactor,</b> it could not be deduced how the individual modes of mechanical stimulation contributed to the overall TEHV developmental response. Such information is essential, both for developing rationally designed mechanical conditioning regimens, and importantly for potential clinical applications, for quantifying the sensitivity of the tissue formation process to perturbations in these factors. To establish biomechanical end-points for evaluating TEHV, in the current study mathematical models were developed to predict the effective stiffness of TEHV biomaterials from the properties and structure of the individual constituents. It was found that the effective stiffness of the nonwoven polymer scaffolds could accurately be predicted from the spring-like tensile properties and orientations of the scaffold fibers, and that the primary mechanical effect of ECM deposition was an increase in the number of fiber-fiber bond points. Toward quantifying the independent and coupled effects of mechanical stimulation on TEHV development, a novel flex-stretch-flow (FSF) bioreactor was developed in which multiple TEHV specimens could be subjected to well-defined combinations of mechanical stimuli. Finally, the FSF bioreactor was used to elucidate the independent and coupled effects of cyclic flexure and laminar flow on TEHV tissue formation by BMSC. The combination of flexure and flow was found to synergistically accelerate tissue formation and BMSC differentiation, thus paving the way toward rational designs for TEHV conditioning regimens utilizing novel cell sources...|$|E

The system was designed with a pneumatically actuated valve manifold system to cycle the 120 extraction points which allowed for delineation of impacts, targeting hot spot source area removal, and overall contaminant reduction while remaining below regulatory discharge requirements, thereby eliminating the need for more costly air treatment. The innovative system design reduced equipment size by 80 % while improving system recovery by operating in the most productive range of the removal curve.

By using a flocculating yeast strain and operating the bioreactor continuously a higher productivity in lactose conversion to ethanol may be achieved with a simultaneous reduction in the volume of residual solids. This process allows for a 90 % reduction in the pollution caused by cheese whey disposal. The innovative character of this invention lies on the use a continuously operating bioreactor with a new design. The integration of the fermentation unit in the overall cheese whey treatment and valorisation process forces the extension of the request for protection of the patent to the entire process...|$|R
40|$|Microorganisms {{traveling}} through circulation <b>loops</b> in large-scale <b>bioreactors</b> experience variations {{in their environment}} such as dissolved oxygen concentration and pH gradients. The same changes are not experienced in small bioreactors, and {{it is suggested that}} herein lies one of the major reasons for the problems encountered when translating fermentation data from one scale to another. One approach to study this problem {{is to look at the}} circulation loop itself. The present work concerns an attempt to simulate the circulation loops inside stirred tank reactors, using a tubular loop reactor specially constructed for the purpose. The reactor carries a number of ports and probes along its length for the determination of concentration gradients within. The broth is circulated around the loop by the use of peristaltic pumps, and the circulation time (tc, s) is used as a measure of simulated reactor size. The reactor system has been evaluated using the citric acid fermentation by Aspergillus niger as a test process. Acid production and fungal morphology, in terms of the mean convex perimeter of mycelial clumps quantified by image analysis, were used as the parameters of evaluation for the two systems in comparison. From comparative experiments carried out in 10 and 200 L stirred tank bioreactors, it appears that the loop reactor simulates the corresponding stirred tank representing a valuable tool in scaling up and scaling down of fermentation process...|$|R
40|$|Producción CientíficaN 2 O {{represents}} ∼ 6 % of {{the global}} greenhouse gas emission inventory {{and the most important}} O 3 -depleting substance emitted in this 21 st century. Despite its environmental relevance, little attention has been given to cost-effective and environmentally friendly N 2 O abatement methods. Here we examined, the potential of a bubble column (BCR) and an internal <b>loop</b> airlift (ALR) <b>bioreactors</b> of 2. 3 L for the abatement of N 2 O from a nitric acid plant emission. The process was based on the biological reduction of N 2 O by Paracoccus denitrificans using methanol as a carbon/electron source. Two nitrogen limiting strategies were also tested for the coproduction of poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate-co- 3 -hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) coupled with N 2 O reduction. High N 2 O removal efficiencies (REs) (≈ 87 %) together with a low PHBV cell accumulation were observed in both bioreactors in excess of nitrogen. However, PHBV contents of 38 – 64 % were recorded under N limiting conditions along with N 2 O-REs of ≈ 57 % and ≈ 84 % in the ALR and BCR, respectively. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses showed that P. denitrificans was dominant (> 50 %) after 6 months of experimentation. The successful abatement of N 2 O concomitant with PHBV accumulation confirmed the potential of integrating biorefinery concepts into biological gas treatment for a cost-effective GHG mitigation.

40|$|Steady-state {{fluorescence}} imaging is routinely employed to obtain physiological information but {{is susceptible to}} artifacts such as absorption and photobleaching. FLIM provides an additional source of contrast oblivious to these but is affected by factors such as pH, gases, and temperature. Here we focused on developing a resolution-enhanced FLIM system for quantitative oxygen sensing. Oxygen {{is one of the}} most critical components of metabolic machinery and affects growth, differentiation, and death. FLIM-based oxygen sensing provides a valuable tool for biologists without the need of alternate technologies. We also developed novel computational approaches to improve spatial resolution of FLIM images, extending its potential for thick tissue studies. We designed a wide-field time-domain UV-vis-NIR FLIM system with high temporal resolution (50 ps), large temporal dynamic range (750 ps – 1 μs), short data acquisition/processing times (15 s) and noise-removal capability. Lifetime calibration of an oxygen-sensitive, ruthenium dye (RTDP) enabled in vivo oxygen level measurements (resolution = 8 μM, range = 1 – 300 μM). Combining oxygen sensing with endogenous imaging allowed for the study of two key molecules (NADH and oxygen) consumed at the termini of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway in Barrett’s adenocarcinoma columnar (SEG- 1) cells and Esophageal normal squamous cells (HET- 1). Starkly higher intracellular oxygen and NADH levels in living SEG- 1 vs. HET- 1 cells were detected by FLIM and attributed to altered metabolic pathways in malignant cells. We performed FLIM studies in microfluidic bioreactors seeded with mouse myoblasts. For these systems, oxygen concentrations play an important role in cell behavior and gene expression. Oxygen levels decreased with increasing cell densities and were consistent with simulated model outcomes. In single <b>bioreactor</b> <b>loops,</b> FLIM detected spatial heterogeneity in oxygen levels as high as 20 %. We validated our calibration with EPR spectroscopy, the gold standard for intracellular oxygen measurements. Differences between FLIM and EPR results were explained by cell lysate-FLIM studies. We proposed a new protocol for estimating oxygen levels by using a reference cell line and cellular lysate analysis. Lastly, we proposed and compared two different image restoration approaches, direct lifetime vs. intensity-overlay. Both approaches improve resolution while maintaining veracity of lifetime...|$|R
