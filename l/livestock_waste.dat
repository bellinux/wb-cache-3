40|$|<b>Livestock</b> <b>wastes</b> are {{considered}} as major environmental pollutants because they contain {{high concentration of}} organic materials. In 2001, The Environmental Department reported that stock farmers were increasing as 5. 1 %/year, {{which resulted in a}} gradual increase in <b>livestock</b> <b>wastes</b> generation. The direct disposal of <b>livestock</b> <b>wastes</b> create several environmental problems.

25|$|Irrigation is {{extremely}} wasteful of water because the distribution infrastructure is old and poorly maintained. In 1993 only an estimated 5% of required maintenance expenditures was allocated. Overall, an estimated 70% of the nation's water supply network {{is in need}} of repair or replacement. The quality of drinking water from this aging system is poorly monitored—the water management staff has been cut drastically because of inadequate funds. Further, there is no money to buy new water disinfection equipment when it is needed. Some aquifers near industrial and mining centers have been contaminated by heavy metals, oils, and sanitary wastes. In addition, many localities rely on surface sources, making users vulnerable to agricultural runoff and <b>livestock</b> <b>waste,</b> which seep gradually downward from the surface.

Community colleges {{were established in}} nearly every county in Maryland. Large-scale, mechanized poultry farms became prevalent on the lower Eastern Shore, along with irrigated vegetable farming. In Southern Maryland tobacco farming had nearly vanished by the century's end, due to suburban housing development and a state tobacco incentive buy-out program. Industrial, railroad, and coal-mining jobs in the four westernmost counties declined, but that area's economy was helped by expansion of outdoor recreational tourism and new technology jobs and industries.

The major source of <b>livestock</b> <b>wastes</b> is mainly derived from swine farms. The study was theoretically based on a welfare economic approach in which the Coase Theorem was employed.

It intended to identify optimal abatement levels of the pollutions {{in order to improve}} social welfare of the studied community. Moreover, a participatory approach is included in the study. The analytical framework was organized into 2 working tasks. Task 1 dealt with a mathematical linear programming model used to derive marginal abatement costs.

The study emphasized on the farm pollutions in forms of environmental indicators such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended solids (SS), and pH value.

Large volumetric quantities of these wastes are produced in areas with a high livestock production density. Much technological research {{has been carried out}} in the past to recover nitrogen compounds from <b>livestock</b> <b>wastes,</b> usually within the framework of a more or less complete waste treatment process. A large part of this research did not result in applicable technology due to various technical and/or economical reasons.

In this paper the most important technologies to recover nitrogen compounds as valuable products are briefly discussed and evaluated. For each technology the stage of development, the applicability and the obtained experience is discussed. The evaluation covers biological conversion techniques like enzyme synthesis from ammonium and production of algae, chemical processes such as precipitation of fertiliser compounds and separation techniques such as stripping, partial condensation, and membrane chemo-sorption.
