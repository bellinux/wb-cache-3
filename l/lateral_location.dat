2500|$|Modern day atom probe {{tomography}} (APT) uses a position-sensitive detector {{to deduce}} the <b>lateral</b> <b>location</b> of atoms. The {{idea of the}} APT, inspired by J. A. Panitz's Field Desorption Spectrometer patent, was developed by Mike Miller starting in 1983 and culminated with the first prototype in 1986. Various refinements {{were made to the}} instrument, including the use of a so-called position-sensitive (PoS) detector by Alfred Cerezo, Terence Godfrey, and George D. W. Smith at Oxford University in 1988. The Tomographic Atom Probe (TAP), developed by researchers at the University of Rouen in France in 1993, introduced a multichannel timing system and multianode array. Both instruments (PoSAP and TAP) were commercialized by Oxford Nanoscience and CAMECA respectively. Since then, there have been many refinements to increase the field of view, mass and position resolution, and data acquisition rate of the instrument. [...] The Local Electrode Atom Probe was first introduced in 2003 by Imago Scientific Instruments. [...] In 2005, the commercialization of the pulsed laser atom probe (PLAP) expanded the avenues of research from highly conductive materials (metals) to poor conductors (semiconductors like silicon) and even insulating materials. [...] AMETEK acquired CAMECA in 2007 and Imago Scientific Instruments (Madison, WI) in 2010, making the company the sole commercial developer of APTs with more than 90 instruments installed around the world in 2016.|$|E

40|$|With {{increasing}} numbers of children and adults receiving bilateral cochlear implants, there is an urgent need for assessment tools that enable testing of binaural hearing abilities. Current test batteries are either limited in scope or are of an impractical duration for routine testing. Here, we report a behavioral test that enables combined testing of speech identification and spatial discrimination in noise. In this task, multitalker babble was presented from all speakers, and pairs of speech tokens were sequentially presented from two adjacent speakers. Listeners were required to identify both words from a closed set of four possibilities and {{to determine whether the}} second token was presented to the left or right of the first. In Experiment 1, normal-hearing adult listeners were tested at 15 ° intervals throughout the frontal hemifield. Listeners showed highest spatial discrimination performance in and around the frontal midline, with a decline at more eccentric locations. In contrast, speech identification abilities were least accurate near the midline and showed an improvement in performance at more <b>lateral</b> <b>locations.</b> In Experiment 2, normal-hearing listeners were assessed using a restricted range of speaker locations designed to match those found in clinical testing environments. Here, speakers were separated by 15 ° around the midline and 30 ° at more <b>lateral</b> <b>locations.</b> This resulted in a similar pattern of behavioral results as in Experiment 1. We conclude, this test offers the potential to assess both spatial discrimination and the ability to use spatial information for unmasking in clinical populations...|$|R

30|$|We {{note here}} that the FAMT {{solutions}} obtained in this study have some common features with the F-net moment tensor solutions: Both solutions have axes trending northwest–southeast to north–south (Additional file 1 : Figure S 5). In addition to the moment tensors, the FAMT analysis determines the source locations and the source time functions. On the other hand, the <b>lateral</b> <b>locations</b> are fixed to the JMA epicenters, and the source time functions are not estimated in the F-net solutions.

40|$|Cranial vault {{thickness}} (CVT) {{has been}} reported at many different osteometric landmarks and features on the vault. Historically, only a few landmarks are used, often bregma, lambda, vertex, and right and left euryon, and frequently comparisons are based only on “thick” versus “thin” to describe the vault overall. What is inherent in this strategy {{is the use of}} a few locations to characterize the entire vault. The problem remains that there is little information concerning CVT variation throughout an individual 2 ̆ 7 s vault, and the causes of variation within recent Homo sapiens important to investigating thickness variation between species in Homo. This work describes thickness variation over the entire superior vault and compares the sexes, age groups and populations in recent H. sapiens. A proportional grid is applied to the superior vault to measure thickness at 219 sampling points in a geographically diverse sample of recent H. sapiens. Thickness values are analyzed in their two-dimensional spatial relationships to determine patterns of vault thickness. Males were identified to be thicker than females at more <b>lateral</b> <b>locations</b> and along the midsagittal plane, although this finding is not statistically significant. Individuals over the age of 45 years are found to be statistically significantly thicker than individuals younger than 31 years at more <b>lateral</b> <b>locations</b> of the vault. Aboriginal Australians are statistically significantly thicker at more <b>lateral</b> <b>locations</b> of the vault than any other populations, whereas Northern Canada/Greenland individuals were thinner than other populations at these locations. The trend of thicker vaults in the older age group and the Australians is identified across the vault, although is not statistically significant at more locations. Several thickness patterns are identified. The boss thickening pattern is the most common pattern, followed by a midsagittal pattern, a posterior pattern, and an anterior pattern. Some specimens do not demonstrate thickness variation and are coded as undifferentiated. Each pattern is observed alone and in combination with others, signifying that pattern causes are not mutually exclusive. Boss thickening is interpreted as the result of passive bone thickening during normal bone and brain growth during fetal and adolescent development. The midsagittal thickness pattern coincides with inferred strain along the sagittal suture from nuchal muscle engagement during mastication. Previous researchers have proposed adaptive explanations for thickness variation, such as protection from interpersonal violence; the patterns of cranial vault thickness reported here point to normal growth and development of the brain as a driving force, a relationship that could drive thickness variation in other Homo species. Comparing thickness at bregma, and the frontal and parietal eminences for recent H. sapiens and H. erectus, there is no statistical difference between African and Asian H. erectus, and between the on average thicker H. sapiens populations and H. erectus, based on published data. Future work will investigate {{the presence or absence of}} thickness patterns in these fossil species...|$|R

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{magnetic anomaly}} map {{of a region}} of intense crustal magnetization near Van de Graaff crater has been constructed from Apollo 15 and 16 subsatellite vector magnetometer observations.

An approximate inversion of this map using a surface plate model for source region geometry has revealed at least four different sources.

Quantification of interictal epileptiform discharges (EDs) detected visually at each electrode location in 2 min recording epochs included computations of ED rates (EDs/min) and cumulative voltages (CuVs) (μV/min). Of 6388 EDs, 81 % involved the infratemporal surface, 18 % the lateral temporal surface and 1 % the orbital frontal area. Forty-eight patients (67 %) demonstrated multiple (up to 5 or more), temporally independent foci.

40|$|Short-term memory load can impair attentional control, but prior work {{shows that}} {{the extent of the}} effect ranges from being very general to very specific. One factor for the mixed results may be {{reliance}} on point estimates of memory load effects on attention. Here we used auditory attention gradients as an analog measure to map-out the impact of short-term memory load over space. Verbal or spatial information was maintained during an auditory spatial attention task and compared to no-load. Stimuli were presented from five virtual locations in the frontal azimuth plane, and subjects focused on the midline. Reaction times progressively increased for lateral stimuli, indicating an attention gradient. Spatial load further slowed responses at <b>lateral</b> <b>locations,</b> particularly in the left hemispace, but had little effect at midline. Verbal memory load had no (Experiment 1), or a minimal (Experiment 2) influence on reaction times. Spatial and verbal load increased switch costs between memory encoding and attention tasks relative to the no load condition. The findings show that short-term memory influences the distribution of auditory attention over space; and that the specific pattern depends on the type of information in short-term memory...|$|R

The torque links are not required if the setup uses inboard brakes, like in the Pegaso 1502, Rover P6, all Iso cars and Alfa Romeo type 116 (and derivatives), as the wheels do not transmit torque to the suspension.|$|E
40|$|The buffet {{response}} of the twin-tail configuration of the F/A- 18 aircraft; a multidisciplinary problem, is investigated using three sets of equations on a multi-block grid structure. The first set is the unsteady, compressible, full Navier-Stokes equations. The second set is the coupled aeroelastic equations for bending and torsional twin-tail responses. The third set is the grid-displacement equations which are used to update the grid coordinates due to the tail deflections. The computational model consists of a 76 deg-swept back, sharp edged delta wing of aspect ratio of one and a swept-back F/A- 18 twin-tails. The configuration is pitched at 32 deg angle of attack and the freestream Mach number and Reynolds number are 0. 2 and 0. 75 x 10 (exp 6) respectively. The problem is solved for the initial flow conditions with the twin tail kept rigid. Next, the aeroelastic equations of the tails are turned on along with the grid-displacement equations to solve for the uncoupled bending and torsional tails response due to the unsteady loads produced by the vortex breakdown flow of the vortex cores of the delta wing. Two <b>lateral</b> <b>locations</b> of the twin tail are investigated. These locations are called the midspan and inboard locations...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the features of}} crush thoracic trauma in Sichuan earthquake victims using chest digital radiography (CDR). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 772 CDR of 417 females and 355 males who had suffered crush thoracic trauma in the Sichuan earthquake. Patient age ranged from 0. 5 to 103 years. CDR was performed between May 12, 2008 and June 7, 2008. We looked for injury to the thoracic cage, pulmonary parenchyma and the pleura. RESULTS: Antero-posterior (AP) and lateral CDR were obtained in 349 patients, the remaining 423 patients underwent only AP CDR. Thoracic cage fractures, pulmonary contusion and pleural injuries were noted in 331 (42. 9 %; 95 % CI: 39. 4 %- 46. 4 %), 67 and 135 patients, respectively. Of the 256 patients with rib fractures, {{the mean number of}} fractured ribs per patient was 3. Rib fractures were mostly distributed from the 3 rd through to the 8 th ribs and the vast majority involved posterior and <b>lateral</b> <b>locations</b> along the rib. Rib fractures had a significant positive association with non-rib thoracic fractures, pulmonary contusion and pleural injuries (P < 0. 001). The number of rib fractures and pulmonary contusions were significant factors associated with patient death.

The high number of fractured ribs and pulmonary contusions were significant factors which needed appropriate medical treatment...|$|R
40|$|Recent work is {{changing}} {{our understanding of}} phreatomagmatic maar-diatreme eruptions and resulting deposits. In previous models, explosions were often inferred to take place only {{at the base of}} a diatreme, with progressive downward migration due to a cone of depression in the host aquifer. However, diatremes themselves contain much water that is heterogeneously distributed, and field evidence supports the existence of explosion sites at many vertical and <b>lateral</b> <b>locations</b> within them. Crater sizes have been used to estimate explosion energies, but this only works for single-explosion craters where the depth of explosion is independently known, and has limited value for multi-explosion maar-diatremes. Deep-seated lithic clasts in tephra ring beds have been taken to indicate the depth of the explosion that produced that bed. However, only relatively shallow explosions actually vent to the surface, and deep-seated lithics are gradually brought to shallow depths through step-wise mixing of multiple subsurface explosions. Grain-size of tephra-ring deposits is often inferred to indicate fragmentation efficiency. However, other factors strongly influence deposit grain size, including the scaled depth of an explosion and the interaction of an erupting jet with topography around a vent (e. g., crater), along with long recognized effects of mechanical properties of host rocks and recycling within the vent/diatreme. These insights provide a foundation for future research into this important volcano type...|$|R

Procedures-Tarsi {{were assigned to}} 3 groups according to known exercise history as follows: pasture exercise only (PE tarsi), low-intensity general-purpose riding exercise (LE tarsi), and high-intensity elite competition riding exercise (EE tarsi). Osteochondral tissue from distal tarsal joints underwent histologic preparation. Hyaline cartilage, CC, and SCB thickness were measured at standard sites at medial, midline, and <b>lateral</b> <b>locations</b> across joints with a histomorphometric technique. Results-HC, CC, and SCB thickness were significantly greater at all sites in EE tarsi, compared with PE tarsi; this was also true when LE tarsi were compared with PE tarsi. At specific sites, HC, CC, and SCB were significantly thicker in EE tarsi, compared with LE tarsi. Along the articular surface of the proximal aspect of the third metatarsal bone, SCB was thickest in EE tarsi and thinnest in LE tarsi; increases were greatest at sites previously reported to undergo peak strains and osteochondral damage. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Increased exercise was associated with increased HC, CC, and SCB thickness in mature horses. At sites that undergo high compressive strains, with a reported predisposition to ostecarthritic change, there was increased CC and SCB thickness.
