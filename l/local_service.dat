5|$|New Brunswick's {{first and}} only {{regional}} municipality was incorporated on May 12, 2014. The Regional Municipality of Tracadie was formed through the amalgamation of the former Town of Tracadie–Sheila, eighteen <b>local</b> <b>service</b> districts and portions of two other <b>local</b> <b>service</b> districts. Regional municipalities must have a population greater than 15,000 and a community grouping that includes at least one municipality. Regional municipalities elect a local council but are responsible only for community administration, planning and emergency measures services, and all services previously provided by any former municipality that {{is now part of}} the regional municipality. The Province of New Brunswick is responsible for police protection and road services, unless the regional municipality chooses to assume these responsibilities.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, BART {{had envisioned}} {{frequent}} <b>local</b> <b>service,</b> with headways {{as short as}} two minutes between trains on the quadruple-interlined section in San Francisco and six minutes on each individual line. However, headways have fallen short of the original plans. While trains do arrive every three minutes on the quadruple-interlined section between West Oakland and Daly City during weekday commute hours, each individual line operates at 15 minute intervals.|$|E

AT employees began to occupy the office space April 3, 1989.|$|E
5|$|Community Transit began {{restoring}} cut {{service in}} September 2014, adding 13 {{percent of its}} former bus hours primarily to improve midday service. In June 2015, CT restored its Sunday and holiday service {{as part of a}} 27,000-hour expansion, representing 20 percent of the 2010 reduction, funded by recovering sales tax revenue and a 25-cent increase in fares the following month. The agency was given approval from the state legislature in July 2015 to increase sales taxes by an additional 0.3%, dependent on voter approval via a ballot measure during the November 2015 election that was eventually won, to fund a new Swift line as well as <b>local</b> <b>service</b> expansion.|$|E
5|$|Fares on Community Transit buses {{are priced}} into three groups: adult, youth, and reduced.

500|$|Ontario's Municipal Act, 2001 defines lower-tier {{municipality}} as [...] "a municipality {{that forms}} {{part of an}} upper-tier municipality for municipal purposes". Ontario has 241 lower-tier municipalities comprising 19 cities, 39 municipalities, 62 towns, 115 townships and 6 villages. Within regions, {{they are responsible for}} providing certain <b>local</b> <b>services</b> that are not provided by the regional municipality. Within counties, they are responsible for providing a wider range of <b>local</b> <b>services</b> since counties as upper-tier municipalities provide less <b>local</b> <b>services</b> than regions.|$|R

5|$|George Trice {{retired in}} 1948 and was succeeded {{by his son}} Derek, who sold Tillingbourne to Trevor Brown in September 1970. In the same year, route {{numbering}} was introduced {{for the first time}} to the three routes then operated. The company made an operating loss in 1969 and 1970, so one route, a <b>local</b> <b>service</b> in Guildford, was withdrawn in October 1971 due to poor usage, and another was cut in frequency. As the Chilworth garage was still owned by Trice, operations were transferred to an open-air site in Gomshall in early 1972.|$|E
5|$|NSB uses Gardermobanen for {{express and}} some {{regional}} trains north of Oslo. This includes five daily departures to Trondheim (including one NSB Night Train). The line is operated by two regional services, the R10 service between Drammen and Lillehammer, the R11 service between Skien/Larvik and Eidsvoll, {{as well as}} the <b>local</b> <b>service,</b> L12 between Kongsberg and Eidsvoll. These services is carried out with Type 74 for R10 and R11, and Type 75 for line L12. Both trains are capable of 200km/t operation. The southernmost part of the line is used by commuter trains heading to the Kongsvinger Line. These trains divert from the Gardermo Line at Lillestrøm. Also the commuter trains operating to Dal along the Hoved Line use the Gardermoen Line until Lillestrøm.|$|E

5|$|The Line {{was built}} by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) and opened on 1 December 1909, along with {{the last part of}} the Bergen Line. The line was {{electrified}} in 1961. Until 1989, nearly all Oslo–Bergen trains used the line to terminate at Oslo East Station. It was also possible to reach Oslo from Hønefoss via the Randsfjord Line, albeit terminating at Oslo West Station. NSB also ran a <b>local</b> <b>service</b> between Hønefoss and Oslo along the Roa–Hønefoss Line. Oslo–Bergen trains ran via the Randsfjord Line after 1989 and local train services have been terminated. However, the line remains in use for freight trains along the Oslo–Bergen route.|$|E
5|$|The {{existing}} 169th Street station {{provided an}} unsatisfactory terminal setup for a four track line, and this required the turning of F trains at Parsons Boulevard, and no storage facilities were provided at the station. Therefore, {{the line was}} going to be extended to 184th Place with a station at 179th Street with two island platforms, sufficient entrances and exits, and storage for four ten-car trains. The facilities would allow for the operation of express and <b>local</b> <b>service</b> to the station. Construction on the extension started in 1947 and was projected to be completed in 1949. The extension was completed later than expected and opened on December 11, 1950. This extension was delayed due to the Great Depression and World War II. Both E and F trains were extended to the new station.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} of reopening the Bergen Street lower level was {{looked at as}} part of the study for the reintroduction of F express service as it could reduce the impact of less <b>local</b> <b>service</b> at the busy station. The station, if reopened, would require significant and expensive reconstruction, including making the station ADA accessible, the reconstruction of platform stairs, improved lighting and communications, waterproofing and concrete repairs, among other things. The rehabilitation would cost $75 million, and therefore the lower level is not currently planned to be reopened.|$|E

5|$|There are two railway {{stations}} in Wigan town centre. Wigan North Western {{is on the}} electrified north–south West Coast Main Line. Virgin Trains West Coast provides express trains to London Euston, Birmingham, Lancaster, Carlisle, Edinburgh and Glasgow. Northern operated trains to Preston and Blackpool North and a regular <b>local</b> <b>service</b> along the line to St Helens and Liverpool Lime Street. Wigan Wallgate serves lines running east and west from Wigan. Northern operate trains to Southport and Kirkby (with connections to Liverpool Central and the Merseyrail system). Frequent local services also operate (in co-operation with TfGM) to Bolton and Manchester (Victoria and Piccadilly), with most trains from Wigan continuing through to other destinations such as Manchester Airport, Stockport, Rochdale, Huddersfield, Todmorden and (until a line closure in October 2009) Oldham Mumps.

5|$|Bergen Street was {{originally}} designed as an express station, {{but only the}} upper level is currently in service; the lower level is neither in regular service nor usable due to its deteriorated condition. The lower level of the station was used when express service was provided on the Culver Line between 1968 and 1976. Express service was eliminated due {{to the loss of}} direct <b>local</b> <b>service</b> along the line to Manhattan. The express platforms were permanently removed from service during the 1990s, and due to a fire in 1999 the relay room was damaged, making the express tracks unusable. The relay room was rebuilt in 2008, and after repairs were done on the line, the implementation of express service become feasible. In 2016, it was announced that the MTA was considering having express service brought back to the line. However, unlike the earlier express service, express trains will skip this station due to the high cost of rebuilding it, thus making the station a local stop.|$|E
