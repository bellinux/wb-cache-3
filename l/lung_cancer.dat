5|$|Asbestos {{can cause}} a variety of lung diseases, {{including}} <b>lung</b> <b>cancer.</b> Tobacco smoking and asbestos have a synergistic effect on the formation of <b>lung</b> <b>cancer.</b> In smokers who work with asbestos, the risk of <b>lung</b> <b>cancer</b> is increased 45-fold compared to the general population. Asbestos can also cause cancer of the pleura, called mesothelioma (which is different from <b>lung</b> <b>cancer).</b>|$|E
5|$|About 8% of <b>lung</b> <b>cancer</b> {{is due to}} {{inherited}} factors. In {{relatives of}} people with <b>lung</b> <b>cancer,</b> the risk is doubled. This is likely due {{to a combination of}} genes. Polymorphisms on chromosomes 5, 6 and 15 are known to affect the risk of <b>lung</b> <b>cancer.</b>|$|E
5|$|LEMS {{is often}} {{associated}} with <b>lung</b> <b>cancer</b> (50–70%), specifically small-cell carcinoma, making LEMS a paraneoplastic syndrome. Of the people with small-cell <b>lung</b> <b>cancer,</b> 1–3% have LEMS. In most of these cases, LEMS is the first symptom of the <b>lung</b> <b>cancer,</b> and it is otherwise asymptomatic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lung</b> <b>cancers</b> {{have been}} {{historically}} classified using two major paradigms. Histological classification systems group <b>lung</b> <b>cancers</b> {{according to the}} appearance of the cells and surrounding tissues when they are viewed under a microscope. Clinical classification systems divide <b>lung</b> <b>cancers</b> into groups based on medical criteria, particularly their response to different treatment regimens.|$|R
30|$|Notably, patient {{parameters}} {{may influence}} image features via a direct causal association or exert a confounding effect on statistical associations. For instance, smoking-related <b>lung</b> <b>cancers</b> differ from <b>lung</b> <b>cancers</b> in non-smokers [27].|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{assess the}} value of chest X-ray film, {{conventional}} CT (CCT), Spiral CT (SCT) and high resolution CT (HRCT) for detection and diagnosis of small peripheral <b>lung</b> <b>cancers</b> less than 15 mm in diameter. METHODS Chest X-ray film, CCT, SCT and HRCT were taken in 59 cases of peripheral <b>lung</b> <b>cancers</b> less than 15 mm in diameter confirmed by pathological examination following an operation. The value of these procedures for diagnosis was analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS In 47 % of chest X-ray films and 17 % of CCT, small <b>lung</b> <b>cancers</b> were not detected. However no tumor escaped detection by SCT. HRCT was superior for showing density and detailed image signs compared to chest films and CCT. The HRCT features of small peripheral <b>lung</b> <b>cancers</b> were quite {{different from those of}} larger peripheral <b>lung</b> <b>cancers.</b> CONCLUSION The SCT is the best method for detection, and HRCT for diagnosis of small peripheral <b>lung</b> <b>cancers</b> less than 15 mm in diameter. CT guided percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy should be advocated...|$|R

5|$|Tobacco {{smoking is}} by far the main {{contributor}} to <b>lung</b> <b>cancer.</b> Cigarette smoke contains at least 73 known carcinogens, including benzopyrene, NNK, 1,3-butadiene and a radioactive isotope of polonium, polonium-210. Across the developed world, 90% of <b>lung</b> <b>cancer</b> deaths in men during the year 2000 were attributed to smoking (70% for women). Smoking accounts for about 85% of <b>lung</b> <b>cancer</b> cases.|$|E
5|$|Treatment for <b>lung</b> <b>cancer</b> {{depends on}} the cancer's {{specific}} cell type, how far it has spread, and the person's performance status. Common treatments include palliative care, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Targeted therapy of <b>lung</b> <b>cancer</b> is growing in importance for advanced <b>lung</b> <b>cancer.</b>|$|E
30|$|As {{mentioned}} next, oral {{cancer is}} quite different from prostate and <b>lung</b> <b>cancers</b> including their surrounding environments. Therefore, brachytherapy methods for them are also different and devices developed for prostate and <b>lung</b> <b>cancers</b> are not applicable for oral cancers.|$|R

5|$|<b>Lung</b> <b>cancer</b> often {{appears as}} a solitary {{pulmonary}} nodule on a chest radiograph. However, the differential diagnosis is wide. Many other diseases can also give this appearance, including metastatic cancer, hamartomas, and infectious granulomas such as tuberculosis, histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis. <b>Lung</b> <b>cancer</b> can also be an incidental finding, as a solitary pulmonary nodule on a chest radiograph or CT scan done for an unrelated reason. The definitive diagnosis of <b>lung</b> <b>cancer</b> is based on histological examination of the suspicious tissue {{in the context of}} the clinical and radiological features.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lung</b> <b>cancer</b> was {{uncommon}} {{before the}} advent of cigarette smoking; it was not even recognized as a distinct disease until 1761. Different aspects of <b>lung</b> <b>cancer</b> were described further in 1810. Malignant lung tumors made up only 1% of all cancers seen at autopsy in 1878, but had risen to 10–15% by the early 1900s. Case reports in the medical literature numbered only 374 worldwide in 1912, but a review of autopsies showed the incidence of <b>lung</b> <b>cancer</b> had increased from 0.3% in 1852 to 5.66% in 1952. In Germany in 1929, physician Fritz Lickint recognized the link between smoking and <b>lung</b> <b>cancer,</b> which led to an aggressive antismoking campaign. The British Doctors' Study, published in the 1950s, was the first solid epidemiological evidence of the link between <b>lung</b> <b>cancer</b> and smoking. As a result, in 1964 the Surgeon General of the United States recommended smokers should stop smoking.|$|E
