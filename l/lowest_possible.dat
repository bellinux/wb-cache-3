5|$|In AV-TEST's 2011 annual review, Microsoft Security Essentials {{came last}} in {{protection}}, seventh in repair and fifth in usability. In the 2012 review, it came last in protection and best in usability; however, having lost its certificate, {{it was not}} qualified for the usability award. In June 2013, MSE achieved the <b>lowest</b> <b>possible</b> protection score, zero.|$|E
5|$|Three teams who had {{the worst}} records—the Memphis Grizzlies, the Boston Celtics and the Milwaukee Bucks—{{obtained}} the fourth, fifth and sixth pick respectively. These were the <b>lowest</b> <b>possible</b> picks they could have obtained through the lottery. The most recent draft in which the three worst teams did not receive the top three picks was in 1993.|$|E
5|$|The last {{eruption}} of Mauna Kea was about 4,600 years ago (about 2600 BCE); {{because of this}} inactivity, Mauna Kea is assigned a United States Geological Survey hazard listing of 7 for its summit and 8 for its lower flanks, out of the <b>lowest</b> <b>possible</b> hazard rating of 9 (which {{is given to the}} extinct volcano Kohala). Twenty percent of the volcano's summit has seen lava flows in the past 10,000 years, and its flanks have seen virtually no lava flows during that time.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order for}} anyone to qualify low, there {{must be at least}} three cards of differing ranks 8 or below on the board. For example, a board of K-8-J-7-5 makes <b>low</b> <b>possible</b> (the best <b>low</b> hand would be A-2, {{followed}} by A-3, 2-3, etc.) A board of K-8-J-8-5, however, cannot make any qualifying low (the best <b>low</b> hand <b>possible</b> would be J-8-5-2-A, which does not qualify). Statistically, around 60% of the time a <b>low</b> hand is <b>possible.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In women, being {{severely}} underweight as {{a result}} of an eating disorder, or due to excessive strenuous exercise can result in amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), infertility and, if gestational weight gain is too <b>low,</b> <b>possible</b> complications during pregnancy. Malnourishment can also cause anemia and hair loss.|$|R
25|$|The railway {{immediately}} {{filled to}} capacity with local traffic, mostly wheat. Despite the low speed and <b>low</b> <b>possible</b> weights of trains, the railway fulfilled its promised role as a transit route between Europe and East Asia. During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, military traffic to the east disrupted the flow of civil freight.|$|R
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of prion replication {{has implications for}} designing drugs. Since the incubation period of prion diseases is so long, an effective drug {{does not need to}} eliminate all prions, but simply needs to slow down the rate of exponential growth. Models predict that {{the most effective way to}} achieve this, using a drug with the <b>lowest</b> <b>possible</b> dose, is to find a drug that binds to fibril ends and blocks them from growing any further.|$|E
5|$|People with TBI are {{provided}} with supplemental oxygen and may need mechanical ventilation. Employment of certain measures such as Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and ventilation at higher-than-normal pressures may be helpful in maintaining adequate oxygenation. However, such measures can also increase leakage of air through a tear, and can stress the sutures in a tear that has been surgically repaired; therefore the <b>lowest</b> <b>possible</b> airway pressures that still maintain oxygenation are typically used. Mechanical ventilation can also cause pulmonary barotrauma when high pressure is required to ventilate the lungs. Techniques such as pulmonary toilet (removal of secretions), fluid management, and treatment of pneumonia are employed to improve pulmonary compliance (the elasticity of the lungs).|$|E
5|$|The Differential Ability Scales Second Edition (DAS–II) was {{developed}} by Colin D. Elliott and published in 2007 by Psychological Corporation. The DAS-II is a test battery given individually to children, normed for children from ages two years and six months through seventeen years and eleven months. It was normed on 3,480 noninstitutionalized, English-speaking children in that age range. The DAS-II yields a General Conceptual Ability (GCA) score scaled like an IQ score with the median standard score set at 100 and 15 standard score points for each standard deviation up or down from the median. The <b>lowest</b> <b>possible</b> GCA score on DAS–II is 44, and the highest is 175.|$|E

5|$|The product {{received}} generally positive reviews praising its user interface, low {{resource usage}} and freeware license. It secured AV-TEST certification on October 2009, having demonstrated {{its ability to}} eliminate all widely encountered malware. However, it lost the certificate on October 2012, having shown a constant decline in protection and repair scores. In June 2013, MSE achieved the <b>lowest</b> <b>possible</b> protection score, zero. According to a March 2012 report by anti-malware specialist OPSWAT, MSE {{was the most popular}} AV product in North America and the second most popular in the world, which has resulted in the appearance of several rogue antivirus programs that try to impersonate it.|$|E
5|$|The {{control systems}} {{also had some}} innovations. The control column was {{centrally}} placed and the pilot sat {{on the port side}} of the cockpit. The column had an extension arm fitted and had the ability to be swung over to the starboard side in case the pilot was incapacitated. The control instruments were located above the pilot's head in the ceiling, which allowed viewing and did not block the pilot's vision. The fuel instruments were electrical. The He 111 used the inner fuel tanks, closest to the wing root, first. The outer tanks acted as reserve tanks. The pilot was alerted to the fuel level when there was 100L (26US gal) left. A manual pump was available in case of electrical or power failure but the delivery rate of just 4½L (1.2US gal) per minute demanded that the pilot fly at the <b>lowest</b> <b>possible</b> speed and just below 3,048m (10,000ft). The He 111 handled well at low speeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{separation}} of static and dynamic data to reduce write amplification {{is not a}} simple process for the SSD controller. The process requires the SSD controller to separate the LBAs with data which is constantly changing and requiring rewriting (dynamic data) from the LBAs with data which rarely changes and does not require any rewrites (static data). If the data is mixed in the same blocks, as with almost all systems today, any rewrites will require the SSD controller to garbage collect both the dynamic data (which caused the rewrite initially) and static data (which did not require any rewrite). Any garbage collection of data that would not have otherwise required moving will increase write amplification. Therefore, separating the data will enable static data to stay at rest and if it never gets rewritten it will have the <b>lowest</b> <b>possible</b> write amplification for that data. The drawback to this process is that somehow the SSD controller must still find a way to wear level the static data because those blocks that never change will not get a chance to be written to their maximum P/E cycles.|$|E
