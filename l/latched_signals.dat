Each of the pair of comparators feeds a latching circuit which responds to an active one of the comparators for latching the associated gate drive circuit for one of the pair of auxiliary commutating switches. An initial firing signal is applied to each of the commutating switches to gate each into conduction and the resulting current is monitored to determine current direction and therefore the one of the switches which is carrying current. The comparator provides a <b>latching</b> <b>signal</b> to the one of the auxiliary power switches which is actually conducting current and latches that particular power switch into an on state for the duration of current through the device.

40|$|Abstract—A {{low power}} divide-by- 8 injection-locked {{frequency}} divider is presented.

The proposed frequency divider has higher operating frequency and lower power dissipation compared with conventional static frequency dividers.

The frequency divider is implemented in TSMC 0. 18 m CMOS technology. It consumes around 3. 6 mW power with 1. 8 V supply. The operating frequency can be tuned from 4 GHz to 18 GHz. The ratio of the locking range over the center frequency is up to 50 % depending on the operating frequency and biasing conditions.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{high-performance}} pipelined architectures {{has resulted in}} the adoption of latch based designs with multiple, interacting clocks. For such designs, time sharing across <b>latches</b> results in <b>signals</b> which propagate across multiple clock cycles along paths with multiple latches. These paths need to be tested for delay failures to ensure reliability of performance. However, many of these multi-cycle paths can be untestable and significant computational effort is wasted in targeting such paths during test generation and fault grading. To save this computational effort, a-priori identification of untestable multicycle paths is desired. We address this issue in our paper through a novel and unique framework: unlike traditional techniques, which focus only on single-cycle path delay faults (for flip-flop based designs with single clock), our framework efficiently identifies untestable multi-cycle path delay faults (Mpdfs) in latch-based designs with multiple clocks. We use a novel graphical representation and sequential implications to identify non-robustly untestable M-pdfs through a three-step methodology. Results for industrial designs demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our framework. ...|$|R
40|$|For {{recent and}} future nanometer-technology VLSIs, static and dynamic delay {{variations}} become a serious problem. In many cases, the hold constraint, {{as well as}} the setup constraint, becomes critical for <b>latching</b> a correct <b>signal</b> under delay variations. While the timing violation due to the fail of the setup constraint can be fixed by tuning a clock frequency or using a delayed latch, the timing violation due to the fail of the hold constraint cannot be fixed by those methods in general. Our approach to delay variations (in particular, the hold constraint) proposed in this paper is a novel register assignment strategy in high-level synthesis, which guarantees safe clocking by contra-data-direction (CDD) clocking. After the formulation of this new register assignment problem, we prove NP-hardness of the problem, and then derive an integer linear programming formulation for the problem. The proposed method receives a scheduled data flow graph, and generates a datapath having (1) robustness against delay variations, which is ensured by CDD-based register assignment, and (2) the minimum possible number of registers.

A flat and powerful thud shook the building; he and his assistant Pshenichnikov thought it was a water hammer occurring during a turbine shutdown. Another flat thud followed, accompanied by lights going out, the control panel of Unit 4 losing <b>signal,</b> <b>latched</b> double doors being blown apart by the blast, and black and red powder falling from the ventilation vent; emergency lights then switched on. Telephone connection with Unit 4 was cut. The corridor to the deaerator galleries was full of steam and white dust.

He went to the turbine hall to survey the damage, saw scattered pieces of concrete, and returned to the duty room. Meeting two men there, together with them he went to search for Shashenok, found him unconscious in a damaged instrument room, and carried him down. Gorbachenko returned to his post and changed clothes and shoes. He was then ordered to look for Khodemchuk, but the search was unsuccessful.

40|$|As current silicon-based microelectronic {{devices and}} {{circuits}} are approaching their fundamental limits, the research field of nanoelectronics is emerging worldwide. With this background, the present thesis focuses on semiconductor nanoelectronic devices based on ballistic and quantum effects. The main material studied was a modulation doped In 0. 75 Ga 0. 25 As/InP semiconductor {{two-dimensional electron gas}} grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy. The thesis covers mainly three types of devices and their twofold integration: in-plane gate transistors, three-terminal ballistic junctions and quantum dots. Various advanced nanofabrication tools were used to realize the devices, such as electron beam lithography, focused ion beam lithography and atomic layer deposition. The theories behind {{the analysis of the}} experimental data include principles of field effect transistors, the Landauer-Büttiker formalism, the constant interaction model, etc. The principles of in-plane gate transistors can be explained by a classical theory. The source, drain, one-dimensional channel and two side gates were in the same plane; a setup that can be obtained by single step lithography. The gating efficiency of the two independent gates was voltage-dependent, which resulted in a simplified circuitry for implementing a logic function. At room temperature, an SR <b>latch</b> with a <b>signal</b> gain of ∼ 4 was realized by the integration of two in-plane gate transistors. Three-terminal ballistic junctions are nonlinear devices based on ballistic electron transport. When two terminals are applied with voltages, the third terminal will output a voltage close to the more negative voltage in the two inputs, as opposed to a simple average of the two. From numerical calculations, this ballistic effect persists up to room temperature. Three-terminal ballistic junctions are so robust that nonlinearity is observable in asymmetric devices and relatively large devices. They can be fabricated on several materials by assorted techniques. The junctions find their applications in analogue frequency mixers, phase detectors and digital SR latches and the circuits are simpler than conventional designs. The intrinsic speed of the devices is in the GHz or THz regime by virtue of the ballistic transport. It is believed that as-built junctions have a potential as building blocks in future nanoelectronics. Quantum dots are zero-dimensional boxes for electrons with a decent resemblance to natural atoms. Due to their nanoscale size, numerous interesting quantum effects can be observed. Gate-defined quantum dots were fabricated in InGaAs/InP by incorporating a high-k HfO 2 (20 - 30 nm thick, grown by atomic layer deposition) as the gate dielectric. The gate leakage was suppressed and the gating efficiency improved. At 300 mK, charge stability diagrams of single and double quantum dots were measured and studied in detail. Zeeman splitting in a parallel magnetic field and charge sensing by nearby quantum point contacts were also investigated. The single and double quantum dots are expected to be useful in fields including single electron logic, stochastic resonance, spintronics, quantum computing, etc...|$|R
