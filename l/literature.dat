5|$|As {{genres of}} popular <b>literature,</b> science fiction and fantasy often seem more {{constrained}} than non-genre <b>literature</b> by their conventions of characterisation {{and the effects}} that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre oriented toward a male readership. Sex is often linked to disgust in SF and horror, and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives. On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also provide more freedom than realistic <b>literature</b> to imagine alternatives to the default assumptions of heterosexuality and masculinity that permeate many cultures. Homosexuality is now an accepted and common feature of science fiction and fantasy <b>literature,</b> its prevalence due {{to the influence of}} lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements.|$|E

This series of introductory readers covers (1) South Asian <b>Literatures,</b> (2) Australian, New Zealand and Pacific <b>Literatures,</b> (3) African <b>Literatures,</b> (4) Canadian <b>Literatures,</b> (5) Caribbean <b>Literatures</b> and (6) Black and Asian British <b>Literatures.</b> The edited collections of source materials {{are designed to help}} students and teachers in exploring the diversity of the global cultural networks which have arisen from the British Empire and Commonwealth. Each volume contains an introduction that sketches out major trends and developments in the region and provides recommendations for further reading. The specificities of each respective region are explored within a framework focussing on histories, identities, language, education, movements and genres, as well as transcultural perspectives. In this way, the first volume outlines 'South Asia,' a territorial concept that includes, above all, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The diversity of climate, landscape, fauna and flora that characterizes this area is reflected in the ethnic, social, religious and linguistic pluralities practiced by its people. A South Asian identity is therefore at best a vague external construct. Taking account of such difficulties, our introduction provides a critical insight into this intriguing area through a reading of its anglophone cultural debates and controversies...|$|R
