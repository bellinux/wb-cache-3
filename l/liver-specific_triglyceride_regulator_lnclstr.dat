40|$|SummaryLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) {{constitute}} {{a significant portion}} of mammalian genome, yet the physiological importance of lncRNAs is largely unknown. Here, we identify a liver-enriched lncRNA in mouse that we term <b>liver-specific</b> <b>triglyceride</b> <b>regulator</b> (<b>lncLSTR).</b> Mice with a liver-specific depletion of lncLSTR exhibit a marked reduction in plasma triglyceride levels. We show that lncLSTR depletion enhances apoC 2 expression, leading to robust lipoprotein lipase activation and increased plasma triglyceride clearance. We further demonstrate that the regulation of apoC 2 expression occurs through an FXR-mediated pathway. LncLSTR forms a molecular complex with TDP- 43 to regulate expression of Cyp 8 b 1, a key enzyme in the bile acid synthesis pathway, and engenders an in vivo bile pool that induces apoC 2 expression through FXR. Finally, we demonstrate that lncLSTR depletion can reduce triglyceride levels in a hyperlipidemia mouse model. Taken together, these data support a model in which lncLSTR regulates a TDP- 43 /FXR/apoC 2 -dependent pathway to maintain systemic lipid homeostasis...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The carbonylative Suzuki−Miyaura {{reaction}} between aryl bromides and arylboronic acid equivalents is herein reported, using base-free {{conditions and}} a limited excess {{of carbon monoxide}} generated ex situ from stable CO-precursors. Under these conditions, unsymmetrical biaryl ketones were obtained in modest to excellent yields. This method was adapted to the synthesis of the <b>triglyceride</b> and cholesterol <b>regulator</b> drug, fenofibrate, and its 13 C-labeled derivative in good yields from the appropriate CO-precursor. The palladium-catalyzed carbonylative Suzuki−Miyaurareaction represents a viable three-component coupling protocol for rapid access to unsymmetrical benzophenones. 1, 2 Such structures are key components {{in a variety of}} important pharmaceuticals including Tricor, 3 Sector, 4 and Evistor, 5 {{in addition to being a}} masked but essential fragment in the benzodiazepine family. Furthermore, benzophenones hav...|$|R
