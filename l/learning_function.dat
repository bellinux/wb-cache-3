40|$|In {{this article}} {{a theory of}} self-directed {{learning}} is presented based on social constructivistic starting points. Social constructivism focuses on the exchange of perspectives on reality between {{people who are willing}} to maintain and strengthen each other's identities. For learning this means that perspectives and perspective taking are important processes in learning. Moreover collective meaning construction is essential. Learning is described as a social-interactive, contextual, constructive, self-regulated and reflective process. The theory focuses on three kinds of <b>learning</b> <b>functions</b> (preparatory, executive and closing) as building blocks that can be used in three different ways: in guided environments, in self-directed learning and in situations where learning is a side effect of other activities only. <b>Learning</b> <b>functions</b> are psychological processes and activities that people execute when learning, be it consciously or unconsciously. The three ways to learn (guided, self-directed, unconsciously) are described as three different ways to organize the same <b>learning</b> <b>functions</b> in different ways. We describe the success factors for these three ways to learn. Skills of self-directed learning are also different for the three ways to learn. In guided environments, skills of learner control consist mostly of executive <b>learning</b> <b>functions.</b> The skills for self-directed learning (or action learning in working situations) are described next. Here the preparatory and closing <b>learning</b> <b>functions</b> tend to dominate. Finally, skills of experiential learning are described. In this way of learning the key skill is to design and look for environments that may lead to unconscious forms of learning where the <b>learning</b> <b>functions</b> follow from action automatically...|$|R

Skinner's behavioral approach and Kantor's interbehavioral approach were adopted in Bijou and Baer's model. They created a three-stage model of development (e.g., basic, foundational, and societal). Bijou and Baer looked at these socially determined stages, as opposed to organizing behavior into change points or cusps (behavioral cusp). In the behavioral model, development is considered a behavioral change. It is dependent on the kind of stimulus and the person’s behavioral and <b>learning</b> <b>function.</b> Behavior analysis in child development takes a mechanistic, contextual, and pragmatic approach.|$|E
40|$|There is a {{significant}} body of literature {{within the field of}} corporate education suggesting that workplace learning leaders are facing several daunting challenges as they attempt to maximize the value and impact of the work performed by the corporate <b>learning</b> <b>function.</b> Specifically, learning leaders are collectively struggling with three key issues in their efforts to effectively support their parent organizations: the alignment of <b>learning</b> <b>function</b> goals to the strategic needs of the enterprise; the development of clear <b>learning</b> <b>function</b> strategies to meet current and future enterprise needs; {{and the creation of a}} mechanism through which the performance of the <b>learning</b> <b>function</b> can be evaluated. Deficiencies in each of these areas are making it difficult to create, communicate and evaluate the effectiveness of a <b>learning</b> <b>function</b> 2 ̆ 7 s strategy as a key organizational support function. ^ The objective of this dissertation is to inform efforts to improve <b>learning</b> <b>function</b> performance by examining the methods employed by <b>learning</b> <b>function</b> leaders who report experiencing exceptional success in dealing with these three challenges. The methods employed in this research are based in the paradigm of practitioner research and involve an exploration of the Balanced Scorecard framework used at JetBlue University as a successful mechanism for overcoming these challenges, then comparing and contrasting this approach with methods used in other successful cases documented through survey data and interviews with nine corporate learning leaders. ^ Based on the data collected, results from this study indicate that high performing learning functions are able to overcome the challenges associated with alignment, strategy creation and performance evaluation in ways that are consistent in many ways with those experienced at JetBlue U. Across the sample of ten companies with particularly successful learning functions, results confirm a consistently high degree of attention and effort focused on alignment, strategic planning, and performance evaluation. Based on these results and the professional experiences of this practitioner researcher, numerous recommendations and a detailed guide are presented for corporate learning leaders to improve the success of their learning functions. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Disturbances {{that arise}} in {{material}} removal by repeated attempts to track the same path have the partic-ular characteristics of non-repetitive magnitudes, but nearly-repetitive or gradual gradient transitions. This paper proposes and validates Iterative Learning Control (ILC) with a PD-type <b>learning</b> <b>function</b> for this class of disturbance as a predictive controller for autonomous excavation. However, parameters of the PD <b>learning</b> <b>function</b> may require different tunings for different excavation conditions, and convergence can be slow when compared to changes in excavation dynamics. In order to improve convergence, a plant inversion <b>learning</b> <b>function</b> is reinterpreted as a disturbance observer in the iteration domain, effectively rendering a disturbance learning controller (DLC). A hydraulic mini-excavator {{was used to evaluate}} experimentally the performance of the conventional ILC and the DLC against a robust controller. ILC achieved a desired cut profile with non-monotonic transients and DLC converged faster by learning disturbances directly from command discrepancies. I...|$|E

The employed <b>learning</b> <b>function</b> is defined as closed form solution function which consists of the error term and regularization term in L 2 -norm term. For this purpose, an iteration technique, a Ridge Regression (RR) and genetic algorithm (GA) are used as learning techniques to estimate the weight parameters of the WKR for the formulated <b>learning</b> <b>function.</b> Through a number of computational experiments, it is found that RR and GA can offer better prediction accuracy as compared to iteration technique when solving noisy and small sample problems...|$|E
