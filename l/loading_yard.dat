50|$|The Derwent Valley Railway reached Kallista on 2 July 1936, {{and shortly}} {{afterwards}} the 8 km extension to Florentine was opened. The track was used exclusively by Australian Newsprint Mills, running Tasmanian Government Railways stock. The station {{was used to}} load logs felled in the Tyenna Valley and a <b>loading</b> <b>yard</b> was built to store the Eucalyptus regnans, Eucalyptus globulus and Eucalyptus obliqua that were used primarily to supply the newsprint mill at Maydena. When road transport replaced rail, the line became uneconomical to run and repair and when Australian Newsprint Mills closed their Maydena depot in 1990, the log <b>loading</b> <b>yard</b> at Florentine was sold.The last documented rail journey to Florentine was in April 1993, when two Y locomotives, Y1 and Y5, hauled a special test train to be loaded with silica sand.|$|E
5000|$|Cormac is a {{forklift}} chugger {{who works}} with Pete in the Drop <b>Load</b> and Freight <b>yard,</b> the central distribution site for Chuggington. Besides working in the Drop and <b>Load</b> <b>yard,</b> Cormac has lots of jobs around Chuggington. He loves driving around and having adventures! He sometimes assists the Chuggineers and Speedy.|$|R
50|$|Evidently {{the railway}} had {{run-around}} loops in Wallersdorf and Büchling, and presumably at the terminus in Münchshöfen too. All the <b>loading</b> <b>yards</b> had {{a section of}} standard gauge track onto which the standard gauge wagons were off-loaded {{with the help of}} oxen or horses. That enable the transporter wagons to be freed up to transport other wagons, whilst the goods wagons were loaded or unloaded.|$|R
40|$|In January 1941 {{construction}} began for 120 {{buildings on}} the site, most factory type structures. Sixty-four miles of roads {{were added to the}} area along with bomb shelters, and an airport to accommodate bombers and cargo planes. Miles of railroad track were laid to connect storage and <b>loading</b> <b>yards.</b> At the peak of activity in 1942 some 5, 000 people were employed at construction work there.

50|$|Goods traffic, {{which always}} had a greater {{significance}} on the railway than passenger traffic, was largely sustained by the timber industry of the region. Consequently, flatbeds and open wagons were utilized. From 1902 to 1909 the Sattelmühle Goods <b>Loading</b> <b>Yard</b> (Güterverladestelle Sattelmühle) was the transshipment point for goods from the Elmstein Valley.|$|E
50|$|The {{place where}} the station is {{situated}} was formerly a large goods yard. The present car and bus parking areas, {{as well as the}} path to the station, formed part of a coal <b>loading</b> <b>yard.</b> The present-day platforms were once used as goods lines and formed part of the large Chitpur Rail Yard.|$|E
5000|$|The {{loading of}} the uranium ore mined in the open-cast mine of Culmitzsch began in 1957, and the {{transport}} for further processing to Lengenfeld, Dresden-Gittersee, Tannenbergsthal andCrossen bei Zwickau began. A 2.2 kilometre-long connecting railway was opened from Gauern to the Culmitzsch <b>loading</b> <b>yard</b> on 11 September 1958; this was closed in 1966 ...|$|E
50|$|The Lower Bavarian {{market town}} of Wallersdorf {{lies in the}} lower Isar valley, 20 {{kilometres}} from where the River Isar flows into the Danube near Plattling. Today the town is served by the electrified, single-tracked line from Landshut to Plattling (KBS 931). The station's former marshalling and <b>loading</b> <b>yards</b> − at kilometre post 52.9 - have been dismantled apart from a simple crossing loop for the current regional passenger and goods trains.|$|R
50|$|In late September, 300 {{dump truck}} <b>loads</b> (3,500 <b>yards)</b> of clay {{were added to}} the track. A {{complete}} resurfacing was done to the track.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} speed up goods traffic and to meet the {{challenges}} posed by the emerging competition from road traffic, various national railways in Europe carried out trials from 1923 onwards with small diesel-powered shunters. Until then all shunting movements for goods wagons at small stations and <b>loading</b> <b>yards</b> had to be carried out by the locomotive in charge of the local goods train (Nahgüterzug). This extended waiting times and reduced the average speed of the train considerably [...] Having a dedicated shunting engine at such stations would not have been economic due to the low levels of goods traffic. The development of combustion-engined locomotives offered new possibilities here: the Kleinlokomotiven were smaller, cheaper and easy to operate. It was anticipated that the resulting improvement in the speed at which goods could be moved would enable the railways to compete with road transport.|$|R
50|$|The Stommeln freight and <b>loading</b> <b>yard</b> {{was closed}} {{at the end}} of the 1950s. Today, there are some railway tracks and {{buildings}} with loading ramps on the site of a construction material business. The freight yard was mainly used for the loading of steel parts, which were produced in the former rolling mill in neighbouring Pulheim.|$|E
50|$|The Chevron Richmond Refinery {{is about}} one mile west across Garrard Boulevard, the BNSF railway Intermodal {{switching}} and <b>loading</b> <b>yard</b> and the Richmond Parkway. An accident at the refinery on January 15, 2007, revealed defects in the community notification system, and {{several members of the}} community were affected by fumes. Richmond City Councilman Tom Butt has made sure that this will not happen again.|$|E
50|$|From 1902 to 1909 the {{so-called}} Sattelmühle goods <b>loading</b> <b>yard</b> (Güterverladestelle Sattelmühle) {{was the end}} of the industrial siding that began in Lambrecht. On the opening of the remaining section of the branch line in 1909 it also became a halt for passenger trains and was renamed Sattelmühle-Esthal because of its importance for the settlement of Esthal, around four kilometres away. During the Bavarian State Railways era it was also categorized as a Type 2 station, which meant that it handled passengers, luggage and express goods.|$|E
5000|$|The {{site was}} {{selected}} in 1941 by the War Department {{as the best}} site to serve the New York Port of Embarkation. Construction began in early 1942. Located in Piscataway Township, New Jersey and Edison Township, New Jersey at , the closest city was New Brunswick located two miles to the south. Plainfield was located four {{miles north of the}} camp. New York City, about 22 miles to the northeast, could be reached by the mainline of the Pennsylvania Railroad. A flyover loop crossing the four-track mainline (now the Amtrak NEC) allowed movements into the large train <b>loading</b> <b>yards</b> without interference with mainline traffic. Many troop embarkations would be at the New Jersey locations of Military Ocean Terminal at Bayonne and Hoboken. The camp was also served by the Port Reading branch of the Reading Railroad and the Amboy branch of the Lehigh Valley Railroad.|$|R
50|$|While {{they were}} {{employed}} mainly in Natal, {{some of the}} Class 1E units later also worked on the Witwatersrand and eventually also in the Western Cape. From early 1955, as the new Class 5E began {{to take over the}} Natal mainline, several Class 1Es were transferred to the Western Transvaal System to work as haulers on cross-Reef trips to transfer <b>loads</b> from <b>yard</b> to yard. Some of them covered more than 8000000 km during their service lives.|$|R
5000|$|Historically, Morrinsville was {{the railway}} {{junction}} of the Auckland-Thames and Auckland-Rotorua lines, which subsequently became the Thames Branch and the East Coast Main Trunk Railway (Tauranga) lines. Morrinsville Railway Station was opened on October 1, 1884, {{to the east}} off Studholme Street, at the junction of the two lines. A footbridge over the track was opened in 1913, connecting the station with the town {{from the end of}} Canada Street. The station was described as consisting of [...] "two asphalt passenger platforms, and the station buildings contain a ladies' waiting room, a large general waiting room, a post office lobby with post and telegraph offices, a ticket office, and offices for the Inspector of Permanent Way. There are also large goods and engine sheds, and cattle <b>loading</b> <b>yards.</b> Five workmen's cottages adjoin the station, and the Bank of New Zealand Estates Company has a large building connected with the siding for seed-cleaning and storage purposes." [...] The original station building was demolished in 1984 and a smaller building was erected approximately 300 metres to the west off Marshall Street, which is still used by KiwiRail for freight services.|$|R
5000|$|A large {{sub-group}} of such yards {{are known}} as Staging yards, which are yards serving an end destination that is also a collection yard starting car groups for departure. These seemingly incompatible tasks are because the operating or road company and its locomotive drops off empties and picks up full cars waiting departure which have been spotted and assembled by local switch engines. The long haul carrier makes the round trip with a minimal turn around time, and the local switch engine transfers empties to the <b>loading</b> <b>yard</b> when the industries output {{is ready to be}} shipped.|$|E
50|$|From 1953 {{until its}} closure before 1962, a rail link ran from Katzendorf to Teichwolframsdorf {{and from there}} to the sächsischen Aufbereitungsbetrieben (Saxon {{processing}} operations), which was used by uranium ore trains running as block trains or in groups of wagons. The loading of uranium ore mined in the open-cast mine of Culmitzsch began in 1957 and the transport of ore to Lengenfeld, Dresden-Gittersee, Tannenbergsthal and Crossen bei Zwickau for further processing began. A 2.2 km-long connection from Gauern to the Culmitzsch <b>loading</b> <b>yard</b> was opened on 11 September 1958; it was closed in 1966. When the Neue Fabrik ("new factory") processing plant (AB 102) in Seelingstädt was opened in 1960, the Culmitz ore traffic was transferred from Seelingstädt station to the processing plant via the Taigakurve (Taiga curve).|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} King Gambrinus {{was carved}} in wood by Gustav Haug and {{installed at the}} roof peak of the Pabst Brewhouse in 1857. The company grew quickly and expanded its complex such that by 1872 a new statue was needed. Carl Kuehns, a carver with the Matthew Brothers Furniture Company, created a copy of Haug's wooden sculpture and the new work was installed atop an archway leading to the <b>loading</b> <b>yard.</b> The wooden sculpture gradually deteriorated, and in 1966, the new cast aluminum version was commissioned. It stood atop {{the entrance to the}} brewery's Stirnewert until 1996, when the brewery closed. The original wood sculpture by Kuehns was sold to a developer in Ozaukee County. From 1997 to 2004, the aluminum statue was stored at Milwaukee's Miller Brewing, a contract brewer for Pabst.|$|E
50|$|A {{railroad}} crane has flanged wheels {{for use on}} railroads. The simplest form is a crane {{mounted on}} a flatcar. More capable devices are purpose-built. Different types of crane are used for maintenance work, recovery operations and freight <b>loading</b> in goods <b>yards</b> and scrap handling facilities.|$|R
50|$|Between 1860 and 1870 {{a station}} {{building}} was built. At {{the same time}} an extensive area was developed for rail freight, including a marshalling <b>yard,</b> <b>loading</b> tracks and a locomotive depot with a turntable and a roundhouse because Elberfeld station had no room for such facilities.|$|R
50|$|The {{surviving}} railway buildings, rails, sidings, turning forks, cattle <b>yards,</b> <b>loading</b> banks, stone pitched {{bridges and}} culverts, stone cuttings, sandboxes (for refilling the sand-dispensing units {{in front of}} train wheels), water tank, signage, and signals and points infrastructure at the Mount Surprise, Einasleigh and Forsayth railway stations and along the Etheridge Railway between Mount Surprise and Forsayth are significant.|$|R
50|$|The line ran northwards {{from the}} Reichsbahn <b>loading</b> <b>yard</b> at Wallersdorf station via Vierhöfen (km 2.5) towards Mattenkofen (km 4.2). One {{kilometre}} before the village it swung west and reached Büchling (km 5.8) about 500 m {{north of the}} village. This was the location for the depot with its coal bunkers, water tanks and a small workshop. Having run on level terrain to this point, the line now ran up a considerable incline of 1:30 for about 250 m {{in the direction of}} Münchshöfen. The course of the railway alongside the road to the vicinity of Mattenkofen can still be made out from the trees and bushes on the overgrown trackbed. The line continued on over the field track known as the Rennweg to the goods station of Münchshöfen (km 7.7) on the road to Fierlbach.|$|E
5000|$|Fronting the <b>loading</b> <b>yard</b> to Macalister Street, {{the main}} {{building}} is a rectangular concrete shed distinguished by decorative stepped parapets which screen a gable roof clad with corrugated metal sheeting. The north-west elevation is divided into seven bays each housing recessed blind panels to the upper level and openings within the recessed panels to the exterior loading dock. Two dock level bays accommodate nine-light casement windows and the balance have either large timber doors or fixed timber panels. The decorative stepped parapet to this elevation contains the lettering [...] "The South Burnett Co-operative Dairy Association Ltd" [...] framed by moulded decorative scrolls to each side. The north-east elevation {{is divided into three}} bays, one of which has a large timber door opening onto the dock which extends through the space joining {{the main building}} and the earlier Tiaro building. This elevation is distinguished by a glazed semi-circular window within the stepped parapet. The south-west elevation has three blind bays and a blind semi-circular window within the parapet. The south-east elevation is part concrete and part timber framed clad with corrugated metal sheeting and houses a large modern roller door.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{not until}} 1854 that a halt (Haltestelle) was {{established}} for the municipality of Wutha on the Halle-Bebra railway (Thuringian Railway), which had opened in 1847. It originally had a [...] "house" [...] and an island platform, {{as well as a}} waiting room built by the municipality. In 1873, this building was replaced by an entrance building built by the Thuringian Railway Company (Thüringische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft). As a result of the construction of the Wutha-Ruhla railway, the halt was reclassified as a station in 1879/80 and a freight shed and a loading road were built. With the opening of a branch line, which was known as the Rühler Bimmel ("Ruhla jingle"), the station became a Keilbahnhof ("wedge station", that is, it had a platform built between the diverging lines). Following the closure of the Rühler Bimmel on 24 September 1967, the station maintained its operational importance, as an industrial spur ran from it and the Eisenach freight yard had to be relieved of traffic {{as a result of its}} increasing motor car loading operations. To the east of Wutha station there were already at this time the loading ramps of the VEB Petkus Wutha. This plant mainly exported technical facilities for seed cleaning and grain silos to other Communist countries. For this purpose, a roofed goods handling building was built. Further east was the ACZ Wutha agrochemical centre, which was founded in the 1970s, with several feed and fertiliser storage halls. The storage and timber <b>loading</b> <b>yard</b> of the Eisenach state forestry company (Staatlichen Forstbetriebes Eisenach), which had its own loading bridge for long logs, took up even more space. After 1980, intensive preparations took place in the residential areas for the building of prefabricated flats in the Mölmen estate on the outskirts of Wutha-Farnroda and in the Am Stein and Friedrich-Engels-Straße estates in Seebach. The transport of all industrially prefabricated panels took place exclusively via the industrial spur line from Wutha. A central concrete plant was built at Rehhof and supplied with cement, sand and gravel from the Bad Salzungen area. To the east of Rehhof, a lignite-powered heating plant was built for the district heating supply of Wutha and Seebach; this was also supplied by rail. Until the introduction of ticket machines in 1994, Wutha entrance building was used to its full extent. There were office and lounge rooms for rail staff in the building and on the ground floor there was a ticket office, a waiting room and a busy station restaurant. On 6 June 2004, a display of local culture was opened at Eisenacherstraße, near the town hall. It provides detailed information about Wutha station and the Wutha-Ruhla railway on three display boards. Visitors can also inspect original parts and structural remains of the Erbstrom bridge.|$|E
50|$|The {{surviving}} railway buildings, rails, sidings, turning forks, cattle <b>yards,</b> <b>loading</b> banks, stone pitched {{bridges and}} culverts, stone cuttings, sandboxes, water tank, signage, and signals and points infrastructure at the Mount Surprise, Einasleigh and Forsayth railway stations {{and along the}} Etheridge Railway between Mount Surprise and Forsayth all demonstrate the principal characteristics of a railway line that was used for mining and pastoral purposes.|$|R
50|$|Designed {{and built}} by General Aircraft as the GAL.60 Universal Freighter, the first {{aircraft}} was dismantled at the Feltham, Middlesex factory and transported to Brough in Yorkshire {{to have its}} maiden flight on 20 June 1950. This {{was followed by a}} second, the GAL.65, which was modified from the original. Clamshell doors replaced a combination of a door and ramp, and the tailplane boom received seating for 36 passengers. The Bristol Hercules engines became Bristol Centaurus with reverse-pitch propellers, a feature that gave it a short landing length and the ability to reverse under its own power. The takeoff run at full load was given as 790 yards, the landing run at full <b>load,</b> 310 <b>yards.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{railway station}} was opened in 1888 [...] on the Blayney - Demondrille line which {{connected}} the Main Western Line at Blayney and the Main Southern Line at Demondrille railway station. At one {{time there were}} several sidings near the station with grain silos, stock <b>yards,</b> <b>loading</b> bank, goods shed, hay stage, and loco platform. In the 1980s services were suspended between Cowra and Blayney. The section was re-opened by the Lachlan Valley Railway which runs heritage trains from Cowra to Blayney. The railway station is now an art gallery and private residence.|$|R
40|$|The IT {{revolution}} has dynamised the port cargo business: up-to-date software {{is needed to}} optimize operations such as vessel <b>loading,</b> <b>yard</b> planning, equipment flow, gate handling, administration and invoicing {{and it is also}} essential for vessel tracking, electronic declaration of cargo and passengers and as a communication platform to all port users...|$|E
40|$|In {{cities where}} their scarce land {{supplies}} have {{to accommodate the}} gigantic capacities of port container terminals, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, the containers to be loaded onto the same vessel are usually stacked together to form tall stacked blocks. In most container yards, only one working lane adjacent to each yard block is available for the empty trucks to queue up to receive the export containers. When loading activities start, {{a large number of}} trucks flock to the <b>loading</b> <b>yard</b> blocks containing a huge number of export containers, thus jamming the working lane. This paper considers the problem of determining the sequence of trucks entering the working lane that minimizes the total time required to serve all the empty trucks dispatching to a <b>loading</b> <b>yard</b> block. An algorithm with easy implementation is developed to find the optimal sequence easily. © INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The precise docking {{of a truck}} at a {{loading dock}} has been {{proposed}} in [Nguyen & Widrow 90] as a benchmark problem for non-linear control by neural-nets. The main difficulty is that back-propagation is not a priori suitable as a learning paradigm, because no set of training vectors is available: It is non-trivial to find solution trajectories that dock the truck {{from anywhere in the}} <b>loading</b> <b>yard.</b> In this paper we show how a genetic algorithm can evolve the weights of a feedforward 3 -layer neural net that solves the control problem for a given starting state, achieving a short trajectory from starting point to goal. The fitness of a net in the population is a function of both the nearest position from the goal and the distance travelled. The influence of input data renormalisation on trajectory precision is also discussed. I.

50|$|When {{passengers}} had alighted, {{the train}} was reversed onto a side line {{which led to the}} goods shed and the wool loading platform, back in the direction of Aramac Creek. Here goods and parcels were unloaded into the shed which still stands, and a row of trucks and wagons lined up {{on the other side of}} the concrete platform to collect merchandise for the town's businesses. The Aramac yard had four tracks for shunting, and a triangle running east from the main line for turning the locomotives. That line also led to the sheep and cattle <b>loading</b> ramps and <b>yards,</b> east of the station.|$|R
500|$|The {{destroyer}} {{was placed}} in full commission again on 17 December 1914 and rejoined the Atlantic Fleet. In June 1915, one of Balchs , [...] torpedoes was unloaded at the Brooklyn Navy <b>Yard,</b> <b>loaded</b> on a horse-drawn truck, and hauled across the Brooklyn Bridge to the Astor Hotel in Manhattan. There, the weapon was on display — along with a shell from a [...] naval gun — for two days at the [...] "Peace and Preparation" [...] conference of the National Security League. A year later, Balch served as the US Navy's observation platform during the inter-club cruise after the Seawanhaka-Corinthian Yacht Club's annual June regatta. Balch was sent to examine which of the powerboats entered into the cruise—reported by The New York Times as {{about half of the}} 200 entries—might be suitable for use as naval auxiliaries.|$|R
