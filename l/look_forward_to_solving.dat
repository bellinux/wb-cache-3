Normally, inertial and odometry sensors are used to complement GPS measures {{in an attempt to}} provide a means for maintaining vehicle odometry during GPS outage. Nonetheless, recent experiments have demonstrated that computer vision can also be used as a valuable source to provide what can be denoted as visual odometry. For this purpose, vehicle motion can be estimated using a non-linear, photogrametric approach based on RAndom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC). The results prove that the detection and selection of relevant feature points is a crucial factor in the global performance of the visual odometry algorithm. The key issues for further improvement are discussed in this letter...|$|E
40|$|Many {{real-world}} systems require continuous operation. Downtime is ill-affordable {{and scheduling}} maintenance for regular software updates {{is a tremendous}} challenge for system administrators. For this reason, live update is a potential solution as it allows running software {{to be replaced by}} a newer version without stopping the system. The vast majority of live update approaches proposed as a solution to this problem aims to support existing software systems, while striving to maintain a good level of safety and flexibility. In this paper, we consider the opposite direction. Our work aims to build dependable and trustworthy live updatable systems that do not attempt to be backward compatible but <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>solving</b> the update problem in future systems. To this end, we highlight possible issues and limitations in existing approaches and propose a new cooperative model for live update to provide better safety and flexibility guarantees...|$|E

But the traditional mode of financing is hard to meet the demands of construction funds, especially, the non-profit and quasi-profit municipal infrastructure. Analyzing and studying on the financing mode of western developed countries, this paper targeted and optimized the financing structure of city municipal infrastructure construction based on the item division theory, and <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> help <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> financing problems of municipal infrastructure construction in China...|$|R

She has found this is no longer so in her classes. Her students now <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> problem <b>solving</b> lessons and relish the challenge. Over that time of change she progressively created her Little Red Book as she scribbled notes while working with Gaye, and referred to these notes in discussions with other teachers. Gaye saw Sharon scribbling away intently during classes they team-taught, referring often to this resource. Over time Gaye came to see that this resource was integral <b>to</b> the problem <b>solving</b> expertise Sharon had developed...|$|R
