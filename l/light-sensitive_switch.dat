In 1671, a new, but still coal burning lantern was installed {{on top of the}} tower to replace the old beacon light. The coal fire was finally abandoned in 1791 when a whale oil lantern 12 ft. in diameter with 12 lamps was installed. This continued until new gas lights were installed in 1871, lit by gas manufactured in the enclosure known as 'the gas yard'. In the 1860s, three dwellings were built for the lighthouse keepers. Paraffin oil became the source of power in 1911, and a clockwork mechanism changed the light from fixed to flashing. This mechanism had to be wound up every 25 minutes by the keeper on duty. Finally, in 1972 electricity became the power source, and <b>light-sensitive</b> <b>switches</b> were installed to control the lantern. In March 1996, The Hook Lighthouse was converted to automatic operation, and the last light-keepers who had climbed the stairs and tended the light were permanently withdrawn from the station. The lighthouse is now remotely controlled from Dún Laoghaire by the Commissioners of Irish Lights.|$|R

We find that the conductance of the two isomers vary dramatically, which suggests that this system has potential application as a molecular device. A {{detailed analysis of the}} band structure of the metal leads and the local density of states of the system reveals the mechanism of the switch. Comment: 11 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|A {{pre-requisite}} {{for life}} on earth is the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy by photosynthetic organisms. Plants and photosynthetic oxygenic microorganisms trap the energy from sunlight with their photosynthetic machinery {{and use it to}} produce reducing equivalents, NADPH, and ATP, both necessary for the reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrates, which are then further used in the cellular metabolism as building blocks and energy source. Thus, plants can satisfy their energy needs directly via the light reactions of photosynthesis during light periods. The situation is quite different in the dark, when these organisms must use normal catabolic processes like non-photosynthetic organisms to obtain the necessary energy by degrading carbohydrates, like starch, accumulated in the chloroplasts during daylight. The chloroplast stroma contains both assimilatory enzymes of the Calvin cycle and dissimilatory enzymes of the pentose phosphate cycle and glycolysis. This necessitates a strict, <b>light-sensitive</b> control that <b>switches</b> between assimilatory and dissimilatory pathways to avoid futile cycling (Buchanan, 1980, 1991; Buchanan et al. 1994; Jacquot et al. 1997; Schürmann & Buchanan, 2000) ...|$|R
40|$|Unconventional {{computing}} {{is an area}} {{of research}} in which novel materials and paradigms are utilised to implement computation and data storage. This includes attempts to embed computation into biological systems, which could allow the observation and modification of living processes. This thesis explores the storage and computational capabilities of a biocompatible <b>light-sensitive</b> (photochromic) molecular <b>switch</b> (NitroBIPS) that {{has the potential to be}} embedded into both natural and synthetic biological systems. To achieve this, NitroBIPS was embedded in a (PDMS) polymer matrix and an optomechanical setup was built in order to expose the sample to optical stimulation and record fluorescent emission. NitroBIPS has two stable forms - one fluorescent and one non-fluorescent - and can be switched between the two via illumination with ultraviolet or visible light. By exposing NitroBIPS samples to specific stimulus pulse sequences and recording the intensity of fluorescence emission, data could be stored in registers and logic gates and circuits implemented. In addition, by moving the area of illumination, sub-regions of the sample could be addressed. This enabled parallel registers, Turing machine tapes and elementary cellular automata to be implemented. It has been demonstrated, therefore, that photochromic molecular memory can be used to implement conventional universal computation in an unconventional manner. Furthermore, because registers, Turing machine tapes, logic gates, logic circuits and elementary cellular automata all utilise the same samples and same hardware, it has been shown that photochromic computational devices can be dynamically repurposed. NitroBIPS and related molecules have been shown elsewhere to be capable of modifying many biological processes. This includes inhibiting protein binding, perturbing lipid membranes and binding to DNA in a manner that is dependent on the molecule's form. The implementation of universal computation demonstrated in this thesis could, therefore, be used in combination with these biological manipulations as key components within synthetic biology systems or in order to monitor and control natural biological processes.
