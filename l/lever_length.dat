However, there is little data on the relationships between the mechanical, anthropometric and gait contributors to the KAM during paediatric gait.

But the avoidance of mistakes of the comparative-versus-absolute-confounding type rests with the knowledge and attention of the user, rather than with the instrument itself, and thus repairers of DTIs usually will not certify the accuracy of a DTI that cannot offer an accurate absolute measurement—even if it is perfectly good for comparative use alone. Such a DTI could still be certified (and labeled) for comparative use only, but because risk of user error is involved, gauge calibration rules in machine shops either demand a [...] "comparative use only" [...] label (if the users can be trusted to understand and follow it) or demand that the indicator be removed from service (if not).|$|E
5000|$|The most {{widespread}} form of self-steering, the servo pendulum, {{was introduced}} {{to cope with the}} power required to operate a larger rudder and was a successor to the servo trim tab principle (introduced by Herbert [...] "Blondie" [...] Hasler). Common to all servo pendulum rudder(oar, blade) systems is the fact, that the speed of the boat through the water is used to amplify the small force coming from the wind vane {{in order to be able}} to turn the rudder. The servo blade can be turned in its vertical axis and is hung like a pendulum. When it is turned around its vertical axis, the water flow initiates a sideways force on the blade area, and the forceful swing movement to the side is used to act on a rudder (ship's rudder or auxiliary rudder being integrated in the system).A narrow upright board, the wind vane, is mounted on a nearly horizontal axis carrier that is itself rotated around its vertical axis so that with the boat traveling in the desired direction the vane is vertical and edge-on to the wind. The wind vane is balanced by a small weight below the pivot, but if the boat turns so that the board is no longer edge-on to the wind it will be blown over to one side as the extra surface area is revealed. This movement is transmitted by a series of linkages to a blade (or oar) in the water, so that the oar is turned around its vertical axis, when the wind vane rotates from its neutral position.As the blade described above turns, the pressure of water moving past it causes it to swing out sideways on the end of a pivoted rod. An immersed area of 0.1 m2 at 1 m <b>lever</b> <b>length</b> at a boat speed of 2.5 m/s (about 5 knots) and 5° angle of attack already generates a moment of 180 N⋅m, when the oar has a NACA0012 profile. The steering force of the servo oar is transmitted to the main rudder typically involving an arrangement of two lines and four or more rolls to guide the steering ropes to the helm or the steering wheel.|$|E

30|$|In the {{published}} literature, AT elongation {{has been determined}} with several methods. The challenge has been {{to take into account}} the displacements of the myotendinous junction, the heel and the US probe. Sometimes these parameters have been estimated, but this could lead to overestimation of AT elongation by 40 % (Gerus et al. 2011). The current study does not suffer from this limitation. The AT elongation was calculated by measuring both heel movement and MTU displacement within the same contraction, without any corrections, with a method that combines ultrasonography and motion analysis. We consider this method to be the most accurate to date. Because AT force was estimated, it is influenced by variation in moment arm lengths. We have verified with pressure insoles that the point of application of force moves slightly towards the 1 st metatarsal as the force increases, thus increasing the foot <b>lever</b> arm <b>length.</b> However, the heel <b>lever</b> arm <b>length</b> increases as well (Rugg et al. 1990) and may counterbalance this effect. Therefore, we have used a constant gear ratio in our calculations.|$|R
40|$|Myosins are actin-based motors {{that are}} {{generally}} believed to move by amplifying small structural {{changes in the}} core motor domain via a lever arm rotation of the light chain binding domain. However, {{the lack of a}} quantitative agreement between observed step sizes and the length of the proposed lever arms from different myosins challenges this view. We analyzed the step size of rat myosin 1 d (Myo 1 d) and surprisingly found that this myosin takes unexpectedly large steps in comparison to other myosins. Engineering the length of the light chain binding domain of rat Myo 1 d resulted in a linear increase of step size in relation to the putative <b>lever</b> arm <b>length,</b> indicative of a lever arm rotation of the light chain binding domain. The extrapolated pivoting point resided in the same region of the rat Myo 1 d head domain as in conventional myosins. Therefore, rat Myo 1 d achieves its larger working stroke by a large calculated ∼ 90 ° rotation of the light chain binding domain. These results demonstrate that differences in myosin step sizes are not only controlled by <b>lever</b> arm <b>length,</b> but also by substantial differences in the degree of lever arm rotation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: GTM have {{developed}} a primary torque standard which covers the range from 1 Nm to 1 kNm with a single load frame and only one weight stack per direction of operation. The design comprises a double-sided lever, supported on strain-controlled elastic hinges, a binary weight stack of exchange disk design for each direction, mounting accessories for the transducer under test and a counter-torque drive with servo-controller. Compared to conventional types with air bearings and a multitude of several stacks, the chosen design offers distinctive advantages: Higher reliability of the lever support, less complicated auxiliary systems, easier method of operation, low overall height. Calculations show that the parasitic moment of the crossed hour-glass shaped springs for the lever support can be controlled to less than 10 - 5 Nm for a 1 kNm machine, and that the uncertainty of <b>lever</b> <b>length</b> falls within a 20 ppm band, including the equality of both sides. Using the same principle of elastic hinges, the overall torque range can be increased to stretch from 0. 1 Nm to over 20 kNm, with only two separate load frames...|$|E

However, the lever propulsion with gear ratio 1 / 1.5 is equivalent to much longer virtual moment arm. For the selected handrim diameter and <b>lever</b> <b>length,</b> the ratio between the moment arms of the handrim and the lever is 1 : 2.36. Because of the longer virtual moment arm, the required propulsion torque is achieving with much lower push force, which reduces shoulder joint force. This result shows that lever propulsion on a gear ratio of 1 / 1.5 can reduce shoulder joint contact force up to 70  % compared to handrim propulsion (Fig.  14; Table  1). The results also show that the push phase during the lever propulsion was significantly shorter (Fig.  8) than the push phase during the handrim experiment {{which suggests that the}} cadence has been increased for sustaining the target speed (Fig.  6). Further shortening of the push phase was observed when the gear ratio of the lever propulsion was reduced from 1.5 to 1 / 1.5.

In this paper we present a consistent model {{of the dynamics of}} gravity-controlled furling systems based on a Lagrangian formalism. The aerodynamic forces acting on tail vane and rotor have been modeled using Xfoil and blade element momentum (BEM) theory, respectively. Due to the proximity of tail vane and rotor a model of the near-wake generated by the rotor was incorporated into the model, assuming a parabolic wake shape. The different design parameters, such as <b>lever</b> <b>lengths</b> and axis tilt angles, have been studied in a systematic manner and their impact on the wind speed values for entering and leaving the furling regime have been assessed. In {{the first part of the}} study the free-stream in-flow wind speed was fixed at a given value and the system was allowed to reach stable conditions. The steady-state values of the yaw and furling angle were recorded as a function of wind speed both for increasing and decreasing wind speed and the consequences for design choices have been discussed.

40|$|A {{separate}} paper (1) {{stating the}} influence of the caffeine factor in fatigue studies in striated muscle response presented evidence for a definite relationship existing between the one-half time fatigue value in a non-treated striated muscle (T 4) and the cor-responding fatigue value in a caffeine-treated striated muscle (T 0). In these experiments, by a method described in a paper by the author (2), pithed frogs (entire animal, frog-board prepara-tions) of various body weights were used and kymographic fatigue tracings were obtained from the gastrocnemius muscle. The procedure involved the use of a constant fatigue load of 40 grams, an uniform muscle length and <b>lever</b> <b>length,</b> a constant caffeine dosage, and an uniform stimulation rate of two-second intervals. In the work referred to and also for the data given in the present paper, a stimulating shock of constant millivoltage was maintained. By plotting the experimental line by the least squares method, the degree to which caffeine accentuated the extent of the isotonic contractions and delayed the one-half time fatigue value, was shown. An analysis of the caffeine-treated muscle tracings revealed both a fatigue value time and contrac-tion height in millimeters which exceeded the non-treated muscle performance in the great majority of fifty instances reported.

The detailed mechanism underlying this mechanical asymmetry is not known. We investigate the effect of force on individual single headed myosin-V constructs bound to actin in the absence of ATP. If pulled forward, the myosin-V head dissociates at forces twice as high than if pulled backward. Moreover, backward but not forward distances to the unbinding barrier are dependent on the <b>lever</b> arm <b>length.</b> This asymmetry of unbinding force distributions in a single headed myosin forms the basis of the two-headed asymmetry.

40|$|Terrestrial {{locomotion}} {{requires that}} animals maintain postural stability against the flexing force of gravity. To counteract volume/area relationships that limit muscle force and may compromise stability, larger animals increase the effective mechanical {{advantage of their}} extensor musculature by walking on more extended limbs and showing allometric increases in extensor muscle <b>lever</b> arm <b>lengths.</b> Assuming these size-related principles are uniform, similar adaptations should characterize ontogenetic increases in size. Previous research on non-primate mammals has shown, however, that extensor muscle mechanical advantage is greater early in ontogeny and decreases with negative allometry during growth. This study extended this work by investigating patterns of relative elbow lever arm growth in two capuchin monkeys, Cebus albifrons and Cebus apella. Unlike previously studied mammals, growing capuchin monkeys face unique anatomical constraints, including relatively long limb bones and positively allometric limb growth. These constraints could augment the flexing torque of gravity at the limb joints and require compensatory increases in extensor muscle mechanical advantage as size increases through growth. Forearm length {{and the length of}} elbow extensor and flexor muscle lever arms were measured in longitudinal radiographic series of growing capuchin monkeys. In contrast to other mammals, all lengths scaled to body mass with positive allometry. Anatomical mechanical advantage (<b>lever</b> arm length/forelimb <b>length)</b> scaled with negative allometry, however, matching the non-primate mammalian trend. Greater muscle mechanical advantage during early locomotion may help young mammals overcome relatively weak extensor muscles and other growth-related limits on locomotor performance.

The velocity ratio of the middle ear is here defined as the velocity amplitude of the centre of {{the tympanic membrane}} divided by the velocity amplitude of the stapes footplate. A mechanical lever arrangement, resulting in a velocity ratio greater than one, is thought to be common to all tetrapods (Saunders et al., 2000).
