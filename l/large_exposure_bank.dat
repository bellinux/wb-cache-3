Using a novel data set of US money market fund holdings, we show that funds with <b>large</b> <b>exposures</b> to Eurozone <b>banks</b> suffered significant outflows between June and August 2011. These outflows have significant short-run spillover effects on other firms: non-Eurobank issuers that typically rely on these funds raise less financing in this period. The results are not driven by issuer riskiness or direct exposure to Europe: for the same issuer, money market funds with greater <b>exposure</b> to Eurozone <b>banks</b> decrease their holdings more than other funds. Our results illustrate that instabilities associated with money market funds persist despite recent changes to the regulations governing them. ...|$|R

Significant problems with loans as reflected in loan loss provisions and net charge offs hampered bank profitability.

The paper focuses {{on a number of}} issues suggested by international organizations for countries and bank supervisors to consider in imposing standards for risk diversification in the credit portfolio. The issues reviewed for each country are the <b>large</b> <b>exposure</b> limits, the definition of credit exposure (including application on a consolidated basis), and the definition of a group of related borrowers. The paper concludes that most of the countries reviewed set limits on <b>large</b> <b>exposures</b> for <b>banks</b> and define a related group of borrowers in line with recommended international standards. The major differences identified among countries include how to determine the credit exposure, the application of the exposure limits on a consolidated basis, and whether to impose limits on exposure to a specific sector.

40|$|Estimation of default and asset {{correlation}} {{is crucial}} for banks to manage and measure portfolio credit risk. This would require studying the risk profile of the banks’ entire credit portfolio and developing the appropriate methodology for the estimation of default dependence. Measurement and management of correlation risk in the credit portfolio of banks has also become an important area of concern for bank regulators worldwide. The BCBS (2006) has specifically included an asset correlation factor in the computation of credit risk capital requirement by banks adopting the Internal Ratings Based Approach. We estimate default correlation in the credit portfolio of banks. These correlation estimates will help the regulator in India to understand the linkage between bank’s portfolio default risks with the systematic factors. We also derive default and asset correlations of Indian corporate and compare it with global scenario. The work tries to find {{the relationship of the}} correlation to the default probability as specified by the Basel committee. The findings of this paper could be used further in estimating portfolio credit risk, economic capital and risk adjusted returns on economic capital for <b>large</b> corporate <b>exposures</b> of <b>banks.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Bank {{loans to}} many {{developing}} countries trade at a discount on the secondary market. These discounts are typically assumed to reflect only the repayment prospects of the borrower country. But the authors demonstrate that factors in the creditor countries {{have a major impact}} on secondary market prices. Their empirical investigation suggests a systematic relationship between secondary market prices and the size distribution of banks'portfolios. There is a strong negative correlation between discounts in the secondary market and U. S. banks'heavy exposure to developing country debt. It is estimated that every US$ 4 billion increase in a <b>large</b> <b>bank's</b> <b>exposure</b> to a country reduces the discount 10 to 15 cents on the dollar. The authors find that discounts and total bank capital are positively correlated over time : a US$ 8 billion increase in the capital of the largest U. S. banks increases discounts by nearly 25 cents on the dollar. They explain their results with a simulation model of a representative bank with minimum capital requirements, flat-rate deposit insurance, and limited liability. The bank's portfolio adjustment decision involves trading risky foreign loans in the secondary market or making short-term domestic loans. The model yields a negative relationship between the banks'exposure to developing countries and discounts in the secondary market.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of Basel ll on the South African banking system through possible changes in the way in which a bank conducts its business. This purpose arose from the publication of the new Basel ll Framework on 26 June 2004, which has been adopted for implementation by the South African Reserve Bank. South Africa has set January 1, 2008 as the implementation date for Basel ll. The South African banks have mainly been focussing their efforts on becoming Basel ll compliant. Business line management and marketers have up until now not paid much attention to the likely impact of Basel ll on their markets and product offerings. A literature study was undertaken which included a review of the Basel ll Framework, impact studies and a review of the relevant literature on the topic. The Framework was analysed in order to determine the major impact themes. Once these impact themes were identified, the literature on those areas of impact was researched. The analysis of the Basel ll Framework identified three important themes that will have a significant impact on banks. There will firstly be an impact on market segments and product offerings. Secondly, there will be an internal impact on the banks in the form of increased costs, decision-making and capital management. The final theme identified was the global impact on the banks, especially regarding procyclicality and mergers and acquisitions. vii The research indicates that there will be both winners and losers. Banks that have large retail and mortgage exposures will benefit the most from Basel ll, whereas <b>banks</b> that have <b>large</b> <b>exposures</b> to sovereigns, <b>banks</b> and specialised lending portfolios will be negatively impacted. A capital charge for operational risk will mean that some areas such as corporate finance and asset management will be allocated capital, which was not the case under Basel l. Studies indicate that this new operational risk capital requirement more than outweighs any reduction in credit risk capital requirements. Customers that have high credit ratings are more likely to benefit from lower credit spreads. Similarly customers that have poor credit ratings can expect an increase in their pricing due to the higher capital requirements for these customers, unless they can provide a bank with ancillary revenues. Competition in the retail and mortgage markets will intensify due to the favourable capital requirements for these portfolios. The large South African banks will become takeover targets because of their <b>large</b> <b>exposures</b> to these markets. Basel ll will have a major impact on the way in which banks will do business in the future and as a result banks should view the implementation of the Framework as an opportunity to gain strategic advantages rather than just a compliance obligation.

Finally, we discuss how some of the limitations of our simulations are a reflection of existing information and data gaps, and thus view these shortcomings as a call to improve the collection and analysis of data on cross-border financial <b>exposures.</b> <b>Bank</b> credit;Banking systems;Credit risk;Economic models;External shocks;Financial risk;Financial sector;Global Financial Crisis 2008 - 2009;Risk management;banking, contagion, banking system, bank for international settlements, systemic risk, interbank market, banking statistics, prudential regulation, bank of england, banking sector, contingent liabilities, bank of japan, national bank, bank bailouts, systemic instability, financial crisis, financial distress, bank balance sheet, <b>bank</b> <b>exposures,</b> investment <b>banking,</b> bank capital, current market price, financial contagion, bank fragility, central banking, bank negara malaysia...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{evidence of}} banks using accounting discretion to overstate {{the value of}} distressed assets. In particular, we show {{that the stock market}} applies far greater discounts to a bank’s real estate loans and mortgage-backed securities than are implicit in the book values of these assets, especially following the onset of the U. S. mortgage crisis. This suggests that bank balance sheets overvalue real estate related assets during economic slowdowns. Estimated discounts are smaller for distressed banks, as these banks derive relatively large benefits from the financial safety net to offset asset impairment. We also find that bank share prices, especially for <b>banks</b> with <b>large</b> <b>exposures</b> to mortgage-backed securities, react favorably to recent changes in accounting rules that relax fair value accounting. <b>Banks</b> with <b>large</b> <b>exposures</b> to mortgage-backed securities are also found to provision less for bad loans.
