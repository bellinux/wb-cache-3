5|$|Anticipating {{that the}} Confederates would march on Gettysburg {{from the west}} {{on the morning of}} July 1, Buford <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> {{defenses}} on three ridges west of the town: Herr Ridge, McPherson Ridge and Seminary Ridge. These were appropriate terrain for a delaying action by his small cavalry division against superior Confederate infantry forces, meant to buy time awaiting the arrival of Union infantrymen who could occupy the strong defensive positions south of town at Cemetery Hill, Cemetery Ridge, and Culp's Hill. Buford understood that if the Confederates could gain control of these heights, Meade's army would have difficulty dislodging them.|$|E

Ya'iri, acting {{with a sense of}} urgency, had decided to go into action without awaiting sufficient intelligence, or performing adequate reconnaissance on Egyptian defenses. His unit lacked artillery observers and, rather than wait for one to arrive, it was agreed the paratroopers would request fire support of the 162nd Division's command net. The brigade was acting without armor support.|$|E

5|$|Stratton {{articulated}} his {{own beliefs}} about religion as well. He did not {{subscribe to the}} view religious feeling was primarily a social need, believing {{it to be a}} need for seeing a cause and logic to the world along with a harmony to things. A believer in dualism, he held the theory of a separate biological psyche and something beyond it. To him the most important aspects of the psyche lay beyond objective science, at least in his time. He sought to explore those boundaries where the methods of science had to stop and declare what was beyond as unknown, limited by the tools of the times. In The Psychology of the Religious Life he <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> definition of religion as an appreciative feeling toward an unseen entity marked the best or the greatest.|$|E
5|$|While {{imprisoned in}} 1924 after the failed Beer Hall Putsch, Hitler {{dictated}} Mein Kampf to his deputy, Rudolf Hess. The book is an autobiography and exposition of Hitler's ideology {{in which he}} <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> plans for transforming German society into one based on race. In it he outlined his belief in Jewish Bolshevism, a conspiracy theory that posited {{the existence of an}} international Jewish conspiracy for world domination in which the Jews were the mortal enemy of the German people. Throughout his life Hitler never wavered in his world view as expounded in Mein Kampf. The NSDAP advocated the concept of a Volksgemeinschaft ("people's community") with the aim of uniting all Germans as national comrades, whilst excluding those deemed either to be community aliens or of a foreign race (Fremdvölkische).|$|E
5|$|Although {{interest}} in the P-class ships and the battlecruiser proposal waned {{for a time in}} late 1937 and early 1938, it was quickly revived on 28 April 1938 with Hitler's public airing of his views on the 1935 Anglo-German Treaty and the consequent increased possibility of war with the United Kingdom. Calling the Naval Staff and Admiral Erich Raeder to him, Hitler <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> thoughts of a strong navy that could pose enough danger to the British such that they would enter into an alliance with Germany rather than go to war. As decided here, Plan Z entailed two task forces each centered on three H-class battleships and one aircraft carrier, with cruisers and destroyers as escorts. In war, these forces would collaborate with the three battlecruisers by occupying convoy screens while U-boats and {{one or more of the}} O class took out the cargo-carrying merchant ships. The presence of the battlecruisers operating at large would have the secondary effect of forcing the Royal Navy to deploy battleships as convoy escorts, thus weakening any fleet that could engage the Plan Z task forces.|$|E

5|$|The NSDAP was a far-right {{political}} party which came {{into its own}} during the social and financial upheavals that occurred {{with the onset of}} the Great Depression in 1929. While in prison after the failed Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, Hitler wrote Mein Kampf, which <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> plan for transforming German society into one based on race. The ideology of Nazism brought together elements of antisemitism, racial hygiene and eugenics and combined them with pan-Germanism and territorial expansionism with the goal of obtaining more Lebensraum for the Germanic people. The regime attempted to obtain this new territory by attacking Poland and the Soviet Union, intending to deport or kill the Jews and Slavs living there, who were viewed as being inferior to the Aryan master race and part of a Jewish Bolshevik conspiracy. The Nazi regime believed that only Germany could defeat the forces of Bolshevism and save humanity from world domination by International Jewry. Others deemed life unworthy of life by the Nazis included the mentally and physically disabled, Romani people, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses and social misfits.|$|E

25|$|In 1944, Louis Waldman {{published}} his first autobiography, Labor Lawyer, {{in which he}} <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> defense of the positions he had taken in his political career.

His plan, however, got bogged down by disagreements and disputes with others, including William Johnson and New York's Governor Sir Charles Hardy, and consequently gained little support.|$|E
