40|$|Current lathe technology, smaller {{diameter}} logs, smaller core diameters, and {{the sale}} of higher grade veneer for use in engineered wood products are all factors contributing to plywood manufacturers using rougher veneer with different <b>lathe</b> <b>check</b> characteristics.

40|$|The {{quality of}} peeled veneers is {{generally}} quoted considering 3 main criteria: surface roughness, thickness variations and <b>lathe</b> <b>checking.</b> This last criterion impacts on mechanical properties of byproducts. It {{is well known}} that <b>lathe</b> <b>checking</b> occurrence can be reduced applying a good hygrothermal treatment of the round-wood before peeling coupled with optimised setting of pressure bar on the peeling lathe. It is also well known that thicker the veneer is and more difficult it is to reduce <b>lathe</b> <b>checking</b> and the other veneer defects. The tendency being to manufacture more eco-friendly engineering wood products using less glue, it is of interest to design such products with thicker layers and so less glue lines. But using ticker veneers should lead to a deterioration of final products mechanical properties. To quantify this effect, we have made 20 - 21 mm thick LVL (Laminated Veneer Lumber) boards of beech (Fagus sylvatica) with various compositions (veneers 1, 3 or 5 mm thick). In order to obtained veneers enclosing different grades, several bolts of a same tree have been peeled following 4 different modalities changing wood conditioning temperature (20 / 70 °C) and pressure bar settings (bar acting or not). The quality of all the veneers has been quantified before gluing. In total, 12 sets of boards have been produced for non destructive and destructive mechanical tests. The main results of these exploratory experiments are: - a quite low weakening of LVL mechanical properties when increasing veneer thickness. - the non destructive prediction of MOE by vibration seems not so good on LVL with thick veneers, {{especially in the case of}} edgewise loading, probably because of the presence of important <b>lathe</b> <b>checks.</b> - in some configuration, and especially when using thick veneers, it could be benefit to load LVL flatwise rather than edgewise. - for the measurement of shear strength on LVL, the 5 -point bending test increases its efficiency when increasing veneer thickness.

40|$|Laminated veneer lumber (LVL) is a {{high-performance}} {{engineered wood product}} made of several wood veneers bound together mostly in grain direction. Veneers are obtained thanks to peeling process. This cutting process induces <b>lathe</b> <b>checks</b> of the veneer with variable depth and spatial frequencies. In this work, we studied the influence of <b>lathe</b> <b>checks</b> on the mechanical properties of LVL thanks to a finite element model of LVL beams made of checked veneers. The checks were modelled as free spaces in the cross-section. Several typical check depths and frequencies were compared, with the beam tested edgewise or flatwise. The {{results show that the}} longitudinal modulus of elasticity and the shear modulus in flatwise bending are marginally affected by checking, while the shear modulus of the LVL beam is significantly reduced in edgewise bending if the check depth is important. This phenomenon is due to high shear deformations in the edgewise bending case, because checks are mainly horizontal in this state. Therefore, the check depth may also affect the resistance of LVL in edgewise bending, thus experimental testing of this assumption will be done...|$|R

Lathe checks of veneers were measured on the loosed side at every 5 mm veneer length under an optical video microscope and their frequency, depth, and length were characterized. Twenty sampling points of 5 mm veneer length were prepared from each segmented ring of 1 cm width from pith to bark. Isocyanate resin adhesive were used to produce laminated veneer lumber (LVL) of 20 mm thick, which consisted of 24 -ply of 1 mm veneer thick, 14 -ply of 1. 5 mm veneer thick, and 11 -ply of 2 mm veneer thick, for glue bond and bending strength test. Results showed that wood juvenility and veneer thickness determined the frequency, depth and length of lathe checks for the sengon rotary-cut veneers.

40|$|Short-term heating of {{softwood}} veneer blocks temporarily softens {{the wood}} {{so that it}} can be peeled more readily. Heating reduces the depth of <b>lathe</b> <b>checks</b> and the likelihood of splitting and thereby increases the quality and quantity of veneer recovered.

About 450 to 1, 000 lb of steam are required to heat blocks with a veneer volume of 1, 000 ft², 3 / 8 -in. basis. The best wood temperature for peeling falls between 120 °F and 140 °F, but the heating periods often are too short for the wood to reach the target temperature because blocks are not properly segregated into diameter classes.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{two aspects}} of the manufacture of laminated veneer products (LVPs). The first aspect {{is related to the}} possible improvement of the shape stability of LVPs, and the second has its starting point in the modification of the veneer for enhanced formability as well as the question of whether and how these modifications affect the bond-line strength. LVPs are veneers bonded with adhesive into predetermined shapes, mostly for the production of furniture and interior fittings. Since any deviation from the intended shape is a problem for both manufacturer and customer, various studies have sought to evaluate the influence of different materials and process parameters on shape stability. Parameters studied have included wood species (beech and birch), an adhesive system based on urea formaldehyde, the adhesive distribution on the veneer, climate, moisture content and fibre orientations of the veneers, as well as the orientation of the individual veneers in a multiply. Manufacturers of LVPs must consider some basic facts about wood in orders adequately to provide shape-stable LVPs to customers. Wood emits and absorbs moisture in relation to the surrounding climate, and this can lead to shrinkage and swelling. Such moisture induced movements differ in the wood’s different directions, and the magnitude is specific for the species. A thorough understanding of this is the basis for achieving shape-stable LVPs. Symmetry is defined in this thesis such that the veneer properties are balanced in the laminate. This means that opposite veneers {{on either side of the}} centre veneer have similar characteristic. An LVP will become distorted if the veneers are asymmetrically oriented before the press. Deviation from the desired shape can be small immediately after the pressing, but it may increase significantly with moisture content (MC) variations. Asymmetry may result when veneers with different fibre orientations are included in the laminate or when the veneers are placed asymmetrically. It may also occur if veneers with different MCs are bonded together asymmetrically. One aggravating factor is that the <b>lathe</b> <b>checks</b> that are introduced when the veneers are peeled or sliced from the log affect the shape stability. In 3 -ply crosswise-oriented plywood, the veneer surfaces on which the <b>lathe</b> <b>checks</b> occur should be oriented in the same way for high shape stability. Based on existing knowledge, the production of shape-stable LVPs requires that the veneers are conditioned to a uniform MC and sorted with regard to fibre orientation and the side with <b>lathe</b> <b>checks</b> before bonding. End-user climates should govern the MC of the veneers and the moisture added with the adhesive during the process. Straight-grain veneers and symmetry should always be the goal. Moulding can cause stretching, i. e. strain, of the veneers depending on the curvature of the mould. To prevent the veneers from rupture, there are various ways to strengthen the veneers particularly in the transverse direction in which the veneer is weakest. However, tests have shown that these pre-treatments of veneers for enhanced formability can prevent the adhesive from penetrating the wood surface. It is therefore important to confirm that the pre-treatment does not affect the bond-line strength.  Denna avhandling berör två områden inom tillverkning av plan- och formpressade fanerprodukter.

Firstly, the typical <b>lathe</b> <b>check</b> depths and frequencies were determined by means of different compression rates of the pressure bar when peeling.

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 A {{changing}} {{raw material}} supply and smaller, generally lower quality peeler logs, are causing surface characteristics in veneer that can adversely affect glue-bond performance. When lower quality logs are peeled, rougher veneer is usually produced. The typical response by plywood manufacturers {{is to increase}} adhesive spread when using rough veneer. The effectiveness of increasing adhesive spread rates has not been quantified. To do so, a method to quantify roughness is needed {{so that it can}} be correlated with percent wood failure, the standard for defining glue-bond quality. The objectives of this research were to define the relationships between seven traditional 2 - dimensional measures of surface roughness and glue-bond performance in order to determine if a measure or combination of measures could be used to develop a glue-bond performance prediction model. Rotary peeled, 1 / 8 inch thick Douglas-fir veneer was visually categorized as being smooth, intermediate, or rough. Samples on each sheet were selected at random and their locations tracked throughout the study. The surface roughness of each sample was measured on the tight and loose sides using a modified laser scatter/optical imaging system. The scanning data were used to calculate seven roughness measures. Three-ply plywood panels were manufactured using the measured samples as core material and smooth veneer as face and back plys. Each panel was cut into standard shear specimens according to U. S. Product Standard 1 - 95. The test area for each shear specimen was the measured sample selected prior to panel assembly. The shear specimens were tested and evaluated for load at failure and percent wood failure. Each of the roughness measures and visual categories were compared to load at failure and percent wood failure data. Each shear specimen was also examined to determine the nature of the failure and with the failure being categorized into one of seven types. Analysis of variance and multiple linear regression tests indicated no statistically significant relationship between any of the seven roughness measures or combination of measures and load at failure or percent wood failure. There was also no significant difference in roughness between the tight and loose side of the veneer, except for the skewness, kurtosis, and 3 rd highest peak measures. Analysis of the visual categories showed there was strong evidence that an increase in surface roughness was associated with a decrease in load at failure and percent wood failure. This indicates that a 3 - dimensional measure of surface roughness may be more effective for modeling glue-bond performance. Analysis of the nature of failure data indicated that the samples tended to fail on the loose side of the veneer. This trend was noted across all roughness categories. It is believed that this may be associated with <b>lathe</b> <b>check</b> depth and that an interaction between <b>lathe</b> <b>check</b> depth and veneer roughness may determine glue-bond performance...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Present {{methods of}} {{determining}} proper glueline cure are inadequate in either production or laboratory situations {{because they are}} time consuming and "after the fact". Monitoring the glueline while the wood composite {{is still in the}} press would provide many advantages over existing methods. Such a system would provide greater control over the degree of cure, helping eliminate variable quality in the glue bond. Dielectric spectroscopy has been proposed as a method capable of continuously monitoring adhesive cure and a specific machine, the Audrey II dielectrometer, has been advertised as being capable of detecting cure of resin systems common to the forest products industry. The objectives of this research were to determine if the Audrey II dielectrometer could measure cure of a highly caustic phenolic plywood adhesive and a resorcinol-formaldehyde laminating adhesive in Douglas-fir gluelines under conditions analogous to mill production. The dielectric spectrometer used in this study produced frequencies of 100 - 1000 Hz and measured voltage, capacitance, phase angle, and dissipation of the glued assembly placed between its electrodes. Capacitance was found to be the property that was most sensitive to changes in the wood-adhesive composite during the cure process. The dielectric spectrometer was able to accurately and consistently measure the capacitance of oven dried wood. Dielectric measurements were very sensitive to the presence of water, and the increase in capacitance with an increase in moisture content was reproducible. Problems were encountered when using the dielectric spectrometer to monitor cure of a resin in wood composites. The lack of repeatability in capacitance measurements led {{to the conclusion that the}} Audrey II dielectric spectrometer could not measure cure of a highly caustic phenolic adhesive or a resorcinolformaldehyde laminating adhesive in Douglas-fir gluelines. Components of a phenol-formaldehyde resin were examined to determine what caused the lack of reproducibility. The capacitance was reproducible with either water or aqueous caustic on the veneers. However, the presence of either phenol or formalin on the veneers resulted in a total lack of repeatability in capacitance. Both phenol and formalin are excellent swelling agents for wood and as wood swells, its microstructure is opened and plasticized. This would increase the capacitance. Other factors that would influence variation in swelling and capacitance would include depth of <b>lathe</b> <b>checks,</b> wood damage, porosity, density, and natural anatomical variation that influences the rate of penetration of chemicals into wood. Even considering the swelling effects and natural variation of wood, the variability in capacitance of the wood-adhesive composite is not readily understood...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. There {{are many}} machines, devices and {{production}} lines that {{are equipped with}} rotating elements (shafts, axes, spindles, trailing and drive wheels, etc.). Correct geometry of these elements ensures trouble-free operation, and, {{in the case of}} machine tools it decides about the correct geometric parameters of the manufactured semi-finished articles and pro-ducts. In this respect, the newly manufactured and operated <b>lathes</b> are <b>checked</b> against the cor-rect geometry of their parts which determine the location of the work-piece and the lathe and their movement These parts are geometrically correct if the errors of their geometrical shape (deviations) do not exceed values designated in the standards. The wearing of lathes reveals the so-called spindle run-out (deviation from circularity). These deviations are determined using mainly the workshop methods. However, due to the considerable sizes of machine tools surveying methods and new methods which use elec-tronic and optoelectronic devices also apply. Authors of this work present the measuring set (which they designed and built themselves) which relies on the two-point fibre signalling device which is installed in the lathe spindle chuck jaws. The position of the signalling device during the lathe spindle rotation is recorded with CCD/CMOS digital camera, and the images are stored on the camera memory card. The aim of the presented research and experimental works was to determine the internal conformity of measurement results that were obtained using the designed and constructed measuring set, to check whether there is a correlation between the results obtained using the dial indicator and to analyse the accuracy of observations that were made using the test set. The designed measuring set enables to determine deviations from circularity during the lathe spindle rotation with the accuracy of ± 0. 02 mm.
