5|$|The Senate convened on 18 September, to {{validate}} Tiberius's position as Princeps and, {{as it had}} done with Augustus before, extend {{the powers of the}} position to him. These proceedings are fully accounted by Tacitus. Tiberius already had the administrative and political powers of the Princeps, all he lacked were the titles—Augustus, Pater Patriae, and the Civic Crown (a crown made from <b>laurel</b> <b>and</b> oak, in honor of Augustus having saved the lives of Roman citizens).|$|E
5|$|The {{idea behind}} the shock therapy scene was based on <b>Laurel</b> <b>and</b> Hardy {{throwing}} pies at each other.

5|$|The {{original}} route connecting <b>Laurel</b> <b>and</b> Fort Meade was MD 216. That highway {{was built}} between 1934 and 1939 along a course generally north of modern MD 198. Modern MD 198 was constructed as MD 602 {{as a military}} access project during World War II. The first segment of the new highway, from US 1 to MD 216 near Brock Bridge Road {{in what is now}} Maryland City, was started in 1943 and completed in 1944. This segment included a bridge across the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (now CSX) in <b>Laurel</b> <b>and</b> a bridge across the Patuxent River. The remainder of MD 602, from near Brock Bridge Road to the entrance to Fort Meade near the Little Patuxent River, was completed by 1946. When MD 602 was completed, MD 216 was truncated at US 1.|$|E
5|$|The poet Ovid also {{dealt with}} the mythology of the narcissus. In his Metamorphoses, he recounts {{the story of the}} youth Narcissus who, after his death, is turned into the flower, and it is also {{mentioned}} in Book 5 of his poem Fasti. This theme of metamorphosis was broader than just Narcissus; for instance see crocus, <b>laurel</b> <b>and</b> hyacinth.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, EVA Air {{converted}} its remaining eight {{options for}} Boeing 777-300ERs into firm orders. The first Boeing 777-300ER entered service as EVA Air's new flagship aircraft in July 2005. With {{the arrival of}} its new Boeing 777s, EVA Air launched a comprehensive revamp of its cabins, introducing lie-flat seats in its new Premium Laurel business class cabin, and upgrading its premium economy product to the new Elite Class cabin.

5|$|In September 2006, a {{postage stamp}} commemorating Prasad was issued in Hyderabad. M. L. Narasimham, in {{an article about the}} honour, listed Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu with Shavukaru (1950), Samsaram (1950), Pelli Chesi Choodu, Manohara, Missamma and others as {{acclaimed}} films by the director after the release of Mana Desam (1949) and his association with Vijaya Vauhini Studios. Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu was one of the popular 1950s films featuring Ramana Reddy and Relangi Venkata Ramaiah, whom film historian Punnami Ravi Chandra termed the <b>Laurel</b> <b>and</b> Hardy of Telugu cinema at the time. Relangi Narasimha Rao 2008 comedy film of the same name, starring Rajendra Prasad, was a commercial failure.|$|E
5|$|Informally, {{football}} and baseball games had been played at the Maryland Agricultural College {{as early as the}} time of the Civil War. In 1890, an unofficial school team composed mostly of Maryland Agricultural students saw action against local high schools <b>Laurel</b> <b>and</b> Sandy Spring. It was not officially sanctioned by the college, but was allowed to use the school's name. In 1891, the same team played three games against Gallaudet, Hyattsville, and Sandy Spring. The victory over Sandy Spring prompted the MAC faculty to officially recognize the team.|$|E
5|$|Interstate, U.S., {{and state}} routes have {{maintenance}} road numbers that {{often do not}} match their signed route numbers. For instance, DE 261 in New Castle County is designated as Road 203. In Sussex County, several state routes largely have matching maintenance road numbers; for example, {{the entire length of}} DE 24 is designated Road 24. Some routes in Sussex County have maintenance road numbers that reflect former route designations; an example is the section of US 9 between <b>Laurel</b> <b>and</b> Georgetown which is designated Road 28, reflecting the former DE 28 designation along this stretch of road.|$|E

5|$|One of the first-produced {{episodes of}} the season, {{it is known}} for {{showcasing}} early designs and different characterizations for {{several members of the}} show's cast. The episode is inspired by the comedy of <b>Laurel</b> <b>and</b> Hardy and features cultural references to films such as Citizen Kane and Freaks as well as the Batman and Twilight Zone television series. In November 1996, The BBC chose it as the first episode to be aired, when they started showing the series, later being beat in the ratings by Sabrina.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{vegetation cover}} of coastal sage scrub typically goes through approximately 25-year cycles, with its peak biodiversity reached in roughly 10 {{years after the}} beginning of a new 25-year period. Such periods are typically separated by wildfires, which clear away dead or dying vegetation and leave bare ground for new growth. The canyon is one of the last remaining sanctuaries for many plants native to Southern California. Approximately one hundred species of plants, most native to California, are found in <b>Laurel</b> <b>and</b> Willow Canyons alone. These include monkey flower, goldenrod, and sagebrush.|$|E
5|$|The pier was an {{immediate}} success and quickly {{became one of the}} most popular landmarks in Brighton. By 1911, the reading rooms had been converted into a theatre. Both Stan <b>Laurel</b> <b>and</b> Charlie Chaplin performed at the pier to hone their comic skills early in their career, before migrating to the US and finding major commercial success in Hollywood. During World War I, the sea surrounding the pier was extensively mined to prevent enemy attacks. In the 1920s, the pier was widened, and a distinctive clock tower was added.|$|E

5|$|Although never gaining wide fame, Ali had a {{dedicated}} following on the vaudeville circuit in the United States. He performed for {{heads of state}} including Tsar NicholasII of Russia. Judy Garland named him her favorite vaudevillian and David Blaine identified Ali as his favorite magician. Portions of his act were captured in the short film Strange as It Seems (1930) and in Politiquerias (1931), the Spanish-language version of <b>Laurel</b> <b>and</b> Hardy's Chickens Come Home. Two documentaries contain footage of Ali taken from Politiquerias: 1977's Gizmo!, and 1999's Vaudeville. Ali's unusual gastric abilities led to rumors that the Rockefeller Institute had offered a large sum of money to obtain his stomach post-mortem. After he died in England, his body was offered to Johns Hopkins University for study, though the offer was declined.|$|E
5|$|Film {{examples}} include Cecil B.

5|$|Kingston had to {{genuinely}} slap Matt Smith {{several times}} in a scene because {{it was difficult to}} fake. Kingston recalled that after a few takes, Smith got red cheeked and grew frustrated at having to do the sequence over and over again. The Oval Office set was constructed at Upper Boat Studios in South Wales. Because the production crew had access to several pictures and plans of the real office, they were able to replicate it in almost every detail. The main problem for building the set was the plastering; the crew normally plaster one wall at a time for normal rooms, but because the Oval Office was round, they had to do the entire set at once. The American-style diner scene when the companions reunite with the Doctor in this episode is actually located in Cardiff Bay. The <b>Laurel</b> <b>and</b> Hardy film The Flying Deuces, in which the Doctor intruded, was done by Smith dancing in front of greenscreen.|$|E
