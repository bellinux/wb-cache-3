The park {{is located at the}} Eastern Sierra de Guadalupe with a low altitude. There are three main {{elevated}} areas that are between 2,450 and 2,500 meters above sea level. These elevations are composed mainly of volcanic soil. They are geologically composed of igneous hypabyssal rocks, tuffs and basaltic andesite. The soil of the Park is constituted mainly by eutric regosols (soils on the convergent toe slope, having typical horizontal arrangements), all of them fertile and easily erodible with low retention of moisture. Some areas of the Park are constituted by litosoles and faeozems haplic. It does not have any nearby tributary. Above Lake Texcoco and Lake Zumpango lined hills part. The Aqueduct of Guadalupe, which produced water for the nearby Villa Guadalupe and came with the vital fluid to Tlalnepantla village, was built {{due to the lack of}} <b>liquid</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption.</b> In general the climate zone is temperate semi-dry type with rains that occur during the summer. There are only temporary torrential runoffs during the wet season and some over-pumping emanations forming small wells of volcanic rock in the Park.|$|E

50|$|Farmers who are {{contracted}} to supply <b>liquid</b> milk <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption</b> (as opposed to milk for processing into butter, cheese, and so on—see milk) {{often have to}} manage their herd so that the contracted number of cows are in milk the year round, or the required minimum milk output is maintained. This is done by mating cows outside their natural mating time so that the period when each cow in the herd is giving maximum production is in rotation throughout the year.|$|R
40|$|Though {{the milk}} bottle and the milkman are {{familiar}} sights {{it is doubtful}} if the general public ever give much thought to the complex organisation which ensures the daily delivery of milk to some 338, 000 households in Northern Ireland. And this is only one aspect though a very important one of the milk industry in Northern Ireland. What is the milk industry? Its basis is the production of milk on some 22, 000 farms which means {{that one out of}} every 64 in the population is a milk producer (cows 2 ̆ 7 milk of course!). A first call on the milk produced is the market <b>for</b> <b>liquid</b> milk <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption.</b> The balance is utilised in the manufacture of dairy products in factories of varying size and complexity. In this paper I have attempted to outline the growth of the industry, to describe its present state, to show the part played by the Milk Marketing Board for Northern Ireland and to point to some of the problems which face the industry. The paper thus covers a wide field and is for this reason of a general nature. I thought, however, that a general survey would be of greater interest {{to the members of the}} Society than a more detailed examination of some particular problems...|$|R
40|$|Mycotoxins {{continue}} {{to pose a}} health concern via human exposure to contaminated food. Aflatoxin M 1 (AFM 1), the hydroxylated metabolite of aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1), {{may be found in}} the milk of dairy cattle and other mammals. In humans, AFM 1 is excreted through the feces, urine, {{and in the case of}} lactating mothers, also in breast milk after consumption of aflatoxin contaminated food. Concentration of AFM 1 in milk is a function of several factors, namely: animal type, milking day, milk yield, season, feeding regime, geographic, and climatic conditions. A linear relationship has been established between the amount of AFM 1 in milk and the amount of AFB 1 in feed consumed by animals, emphasized at first on the reduction or removal of AFB 1 from feedstuffs and then elimination of AFM 1 from milk. This review aims to bring up to date the current global status of AFM 1 contamination of <b>liquid</b> milk destined <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption</b> and the effects of processing and reduction methods on the elimination of aflatoxins from liquid milk...|$|R
40|$|FACTS AND FICTION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: THE BALSAMIC VINEGAR CASE STUDY The {{history of}} {{microbial}} biotransformation is {{closely associated with}} vinegar production, which dates back to around 2000 years B. C. However, among fermented foods, vinegar has always been considered a poor commodity {{because it is not}} a food, lacks significant nutritional value, and it is produced from the transformation of richer and more nutritive fermented foods, such as wine and honey. Vinegar is a flavoring agent, but also a preservative and in some countries it’s considered a healthy drink. Vinegar production is regulated by an extensive set of statutes and the definition of vinegar varies from a country to another. FAO/WHO defines vinegar as any <b>liquid,</b> fit <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption,</b> produced exclusively from suitable products containing starch and/or sugars by the process of double fermentation, first alcoholic and then acetous. Several botanical species can be used for vinegar production on the condition they satisfy two main basic requirements. Firstly they must be safe <b>for</b> <b>human</b> and animal <b>consumption,</b> and secondly they must provide a direct or indirect source of fermentable sugar. The two fundamental steps in vinegar production are the preparation of the raw materials and the fermentation. The first stage embraces all the necessary operations to ensure the availability of fermentable sugar and protein insolution, including slicing and/or crushing to obtain the fruit juice, enzymatic digestion of starch (for cereals), in some more easily stored and preserved, making their use independent of harvesting time. In general, vinegars are properly ascribed to the wider category of condiments, and they fall into two different sub categories: with and without Geographical Indication (GI). Under region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its geographical origin”. GIs and trademarks are also similar in terms of the rationale behind their legal protection, that is, consumer protection and prevention of unfair competition. Misuse of GIs may be detrimental to the interests of consumers and constitute unfair competition between producers. Nowadays in the European Community there are four vinegars with the PDO and two with the PGI, the first vinegar with recognized GI status was applied to the two Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena and of Reggio Emilia and it date back to year 2000. The more recent one is the PGI of Zhenjiang Xiang Cu, in the year 2012. Third balsamic vinegar had the PGI in 2009 the Aceto Balsamico di Modena (ABM), with the opposition of some state member...|$|R
