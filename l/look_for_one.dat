He finished {{fourth in the}} Chicago Tribune's Silver Football voting, given out to the Big Ten's Most Valuable Player, behind Brandon Graham, Daryll Clark and John Clay. [...] Hall of Fame quarterback Bob Griese said Kafka [...] "has the three qualities I <b>look</b> <b>for.</b> <b>One,</b> he's a good decision-maker, he knows when {{to throw the ball}} away. Two, he's accurate. Three, he makes plays. This is where Kafka really jumps out. If he has a playmaker downfield, he gets the ball to him." [...] Kafka graduated from Northwestern in December.|$|E
500|$|In August 2013, it was {{announced}} that it would reopen in October under a new chef-owner, Chris Harrod. Harrod had previously worked under Raymond Blanc at two Michelin starred restaurant Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons. He had been looking for a restaurant with rooms to purchase, having originally thought to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>one</b> in the Chiltern Hills where they could be added. Harrod said that [...] "I went and had a look and was amazed to find that the Crown at Whitebrook ticked all the boxes for what I was looking for. It had the location, the quality suppliers and I knew straight away that I had been looking in the wrong place." [...] The Crown at Whitebrook reopened the following October, and gained a new Michelin star under the new team in the 2014 list. In February 2015, the restaurant was renamed to The Whitebrook.|$|E

Berlusconi said his party's platform would include opposition to Monti's economic performance, which he said put Italy into a [...] "recessive spiral without end." [...] He also told the media, on the sidelines of A.C. Milan's practice session (the football club he owns along with Mediaset, the largest media outlet in the country): [...] "I race to win. To win, everyone said {{there had to be}} a tested leader. It's not that we did not <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>one.</b> We did, and how! But there isn't one...I'm doing it out of a sense of responsibility." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fouts was not {{a mobile}} quarterback and the deep passing game led to many hits. Hall of Fame coach Bill Walsh, a Chargers {{assistant}} coach in 1976, said [...] "Dan Fouts had a cool, steel-like nerve and courage ... He {{took a lot of}} beatings, a lot of pounding, but continued to play, hurt or otherwise. He played more physical football than anybody on his team, including the linebackers". Rarely using the shotgun, Fouts would drop back from center and <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>one</b> of a bevy of great receivers. Wide receiver Charlie Joiner and tight end Kellen Winslow were the most famous, both now in the Hall of Fame, but John Jefferson and Wes Chandler, among others, were also key. Fouts's passing enabled Winslow to lead the NFL in receptions twice (1980,1981), while Winslow (1982) and Lionel James (1985) led the AFC in receptions on another 2 combined occasions. James, in fact, set the NFL record (since broken) in 1985 for receiving yards by a running back at 1,027. Jefferson became the first receiver to have 1,000yards receiving in each of his first three seasons in the NFL. Both Jefferson (1980) and Chandler (1982) led the NFL in receiving yards. Chandler's 129yards receiving per game average in 1982 is still a league record. Both Jefferson (1978, 1980) and Chandler (1982) led the NFL in receiving TDs. In 1980, Winslow, Jefferson and Joiner became the first trio on the same team to have 1,000yards receiving in a season. When he retired after 1986, Joiner was the NFL's all-time leader in receptions with 750.|$|E

For this reason a scalper must have very strict risk management never allowing a loss to accumulate.|$|R
