40|$|Abstract We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that fruit quantity and quality vary vertically within trees. We quantified intratree fruit production before exploitation by frugivores at different heights in 89 trees from 17 species fed on by primates in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We also conducted a pilot study {{to determine if the}} nutritional value of fruit varied within tree crowns. Depending on the species and crown size, we divided tree canopies into 2 or 3 vertical layers. In 2 -layered trees, upper crowns produced fruits that were 9. 6 – 30. 1 % bigger and 0. 52 – 140 times the densities of those from <b>lower</b> <b>crowns,</b> with one exception. Among 2 -layered trees, upper crowns produced a mean of 46. 9 fruits/m 3 (median 12. 1), while <b>lower</b> <b>crowns</b> produced a mean of 14. 1 fruits/m 3 (median 2. 5). Among 3 -layered trees, upper crowns produced a mean density of 49. 9 fruits/m 3 (median 12. 5), middle crowns a mean of 16. 8 fruits/m 3 (median 6. 6), and <b>lower</b> <b>crowns</b> a mean of 12. 8 fruits/m 3 (median 1. 8). Dry pulp and moisture were systematically greater per fruit in the highest compared to the lowest canopy layers (22. 4 % and 16. 4 % respectively in 2 -layered trees, 49. 7 % and 21. 8 % respectively in 3 -layered trees).

40|$|The {{canopies}} of old-growth Douglas-fir forests {{support a}} diversity of epiphytic lichens and bryophytes. We quantified the vertical distributions of six dominant epiphytes throughout the crowns of large Tsuga heterophylla (46 - 57 m tall) and Pseudotsuga menziesii (60 - 78 m tall) trees in five forest stands of the central Oregon Cascades. There were no major differences in epiphyte distribution between the two tree species, but epiphytes on T. heterophylla generally peaked in abundance at heights 10 - 20 m below those on P. menziesii. Alectorioid lichens were most abundant in the upper crowns but scarce in the <b>lower</b> <b>crowns.</b> The fruticose green algal lichen Sphaerophorus globosus was evenly distributed throughout the crowns. The cyanolichen Lobaria oregana and the moss Antitrichia curtipendula were most abundant in middle crowns. Lobaria pulmonaria was most abundant in the lower-middle crowns.

Torching indices were greater than moderate and severe fire weather condition wind speeds, indicating that torching is unlikely.

50|$|Symptoms of {{the disease}} include dying {{branches}} and stems. Initially, cankers develop on branches in the <b>lower</b> <b>crown.</b> Spores developing on these dying branches are spread by rainwater to tree stems. Stem cankers develop 1 to 3 years after branches die. Tree tops killed by stem-girdling cankers do not resprout. Diseased trees usually die within several years. Completely free-standing trees seem better able to withstand the fungus than those growing in dense stands or forest. In some areas, 90% of the butternut trees have been killed. The disease {{is reported to have}} eliminated butternut from North and South Carolina. The disease is also reported to be spreading rapidly in Wisconsin. By contrast, black walnut seems to be resistant to the disease.|$|E

40|$|Questions: What {{were the}} {{characteristics}} of pre-Anglo-American (reference) forests before logging, grazing and fire exclusion, and how have they changed? What were the structural characteristics of canopy and surface fuels and potential fire behaviour in reference forests, {{and how do they}} compare to contemporary forests? How might information from reference conditions be used to inform current restoration andmanagement practices? Location: Lake Tahoe Basin in the Sierra Nevada, California and Nevada, USA. Methods: Tree species composition, size structure, basal area, density, surface and canopy fuels, and potential fire behaviour were quantified for reference and contemporary conditions in 32 stands. This was accomplished by integrating field measurements and dendroecological techniques with vegetation and fire behaviour simulationmodels. Results: Contemporary Jeffrey pine and mixed conifer forests had more trees, more basal area, smaller trees and a different size structure than the reference forest. Contemporary red fir and lodgepole pine forests also had more and smaller trees, but basal areas were similar to the reference. Red fir forests also shifted in composition towards lodgepole pine. Vegetation and fire models indicate that contemporary Jeffrey pine and mixed conifer forests have higher flame length, rates of spread, <b>lower</b> <b>crowning</b> and torching indices, and more passive crown fire than the reference forests. In contrast, contemporary red fir and lodgepole pine forests only had <b>lower</b> <b>crowning</b> and torching indices, and flame length and rate of spread were only higher with extreme weather and high surface fuel load. Conclusions: Contemporary Jeffrey pine and mixed conifer forests deviate the most from the reference, and restoration objectives for these forests should emphasize density and basal area reduction of smaller diameter stems. Restoration objectives for red fir should shift species composition and reduce basal area by thinning smaller diameter lodgepole pine. For lodgepole pine forests, restoration objectives should include reduction of density and basal area of smaller diameter stems. Fire or other surface fuel treatments will be needed in all the forests tomaintain lower fuel loads, albeit at different time intervals...|$|R

5000|$|When {{affected}} by the disease, the oak develops vein necrosis confined to the leaf midvein and major lateral veins, eventually causing leaf death. Symptoms typically start in the <b>lower</b> <b>crown</b> of the tree and eventually spread to the entire tree. [...] If this disease persists for many years, there can be lasting effects. One example is the possible loss of food reserves. This can leave the tree susceptible to greater insect predation, secondary infections from other pathogens, and death. A distinguishing characteristic of T. iowensis is the formation of black crustose asexual fruiting bodies {{at the base of}} the petioles that are retained until the following year. These distinctive fruiting bodies are pycnothyria (conidiomata) with radiating setae-like hyphae that form along the necrotic veins.|$|E

50|$|Early Stanley {{cars had}} light wooden bodies mounted on tubular steel frames {{by means of}} full-elliptic springs. Steam was {{generated}} in a vertical fire-tube boiler, mounted beneath the seat, with a vaporizing gasoline (later, kerosene) burner underneath. The boiler was reinforced by several layers of piano wire wound around it, which gave it a strong but relatively light-weight shell. In early models, the vertical fire-tubes were made of copper, and were expanded into holes in the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>crown</b> sheets. In later models, the installation of a condenser caused oil-fouling in the expansion joints, and welded steel fire-tubes had to used. The boilers were reasonably safe, since they were fitted with safety valves.
