40|$|Self-etching dentine <b>bonding</b> <b>agents</b> are {{a recent}} {{addition}} to the choice of <b>bonding</b> <b>agents</b> which a clinician has available to bond resin restorations to tooth structure. The so-called ‘traditional’, total-etch fourth and fifth generation dentine <b>bonding</b> <b>agents</b> have proven their clinical abilities and the question now remains whether these ‘new’ self-etching dentine <b>bonding</b> <b>agents</b> will clinically perform {{as well as the}} ‘proven’ total-etch dentine <b>bonding</b> <b>agents.</b> For the purpose of this dissertation the author completed three research projects which were performed to evaluate the efficacy of a selection of dentine <b>bonding</b> <b>agents</b> and then used the results to compare some properties (shear bond strength, microleakage, and anti-bacterial properties) of total-etch dentine <b>bonding</b> <b>agents</b> with some self-etching dentine <b>bonding</b> <b>agents.</b> All discussions will focus on the three dentine <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> properties evaluated by the three research projects performed. The three specific aims of this study were: To compare the dentine shear bond strength of a selection of self-etching dentine <b>bonding</b> <b>agents</b> with that of a total-etch dentine <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> control. To compare dentine and enamel microleakage values of a selection of self-etching <b>bonding</b> <b>agents</b> with that of a total-etch dentine <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> control. To evaluate the possible anti-bacterial properties of a selection of dentine <b>bonding</b> <b>agents,</b> with focus placed on the self-etching dentine <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> ABFb (Clearfil Protect Bond). The studies performed by the author achieved comparative/similar results to some studies described in the literature but {{it is clear from the}} literature that some studies provide conflicting results, especially leakage of enamel margins when using self-etching <b>bonding</b> <b>agents.</b> Taking into consideration the limitations of the three studies performed, it can be concluded that as far as the three evaluated properties of self-etching dentine <b>bonding</b> <b>agents</b> are concerned, they should prove to be acceptable clinical alternatives for use in place of total-etch dentine <b>bonding</b> <b>agents.</b> CopyrightDissertation (MSc(Odont)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

Composite resin is the most esthetic restorative material currently available for restoring teeth. In spite of it being in use since a decade, still failure cases are seen which are mainly due to polymerization shrinkage and subsequent inadequate adhesion to cavity walls, leading to microleakage. Various generations of dentin <b>bonding</b> <b>agents</b> have been introduced to overcome the shortcoming of composite resin. Aims: To determine the microleakage of the 6 th, 7 th, and 8 th generation dentin <b>bonding</b> <b>agents.</b> Materials and Methods: Forty-five extracted human premolars were taken for the study. Standardized Class V cavities were prepared on all the teeth. The samples were divided into three groups according to the generation of <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> used. Group I was bonded with the 6 th generation, Group II with the 7 th generation, and Group III with the 8 th generation dentin <b>bonding</b> <b>agent.</b> All the Class V preparations were restored with a nano-ceramic composite restorative (Ceram X). The samples were then thermocycled between 5 and 55 ± 2 °C for 100 cycles and immersed in 2 % methylene blue for 48 h for evaluation of microleakage under a stereomicroscope.

Methods Thirty-five samples of MTA blocks were divided into 7 groups with 3 different times (10 minutes, 1 day, and 7 days) selected for restoring the composite resin over MTA with and without bonding resin, and a control group was included for comparison. After 21 days, the distances between MTA and the composite resin or between MTA and the <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> on sectioned planes along the long axis were measured using a scanning electron microscope (× 2, 000 magnification). The hardness of the MTA near the composite resin was presented as the Vickers microhardness. Results There were no gaps at the interface in the 10 -minute groups, the 1 -day group with a <b>bonding</b> <b>agent,</b> and the 7 -day group with a <b>bonding</b> <b>agent.</b> The groups without a <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> at 1 and 7 days presented a separation or gap at the interface.

In the first group, Seal-Rite fissure sealant and Dentastic (Pulpdent, USA) without saliva contamination, {{and in the second}} group sealant with <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> after saliva contamination for 10 s, were applied and cured for 40 s. In the third group, fissure sealant without <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> or saliva contamination, and in the fourth group fissure sealant without bonding application was applied after contamination with saliva and then was cured. After thermocycling, the teeth were placed in 50 % silver nitrate for 2 hours. The buccolingual sections were applied and microleakage evaluation was made by stereomicroscope at 4 X magnifications and results were evaluated with mann-whiteny test. Results: The fissure sealant group without <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> showed the most microleakage after contamination to saliva and use of sealant with <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> significantly showed decrease of microleakage. Conclusion: Use of <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> under fissure sealant in saliva-contamination status is beneficial for decreasing microleakage...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Shear bond {{strength}} {{is one of}} the most important mechanical characteristics involved in clinical durability of tooth-colored restorations, which is directly related to polymerization shrinkage. This study evaluated the efficacy of two light-curing units (LED 2 & QTH) and two types of dentin <b>bonding</b> <b>agents</b> (Excite & Clearfil SE bond) on composite resin shear {{bond strength}} to dentin. Materials and Methods: Forty caries-free sound human premolars were randomly divided into 4 groups of 10 after being disinfected with sodium hypochlorite. The occlusal surface of dentin in each specimen was exposed and flattened by a fissure bur; composite resin was bonded with Excite or Clearfil SE <b>bonding</b> <b>agents</b> and polymerized with QTH or LED 2. Shear bond strength values of the specimens were tested in a Dartec universal testing machine. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA and Dunkan test (α = 0. 05). Results: Maximum shear bond strength values were recorded in composite restorations bonded with Clearfil SE <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> and polymerized by LED 2; minimum values were recorded in composites restorations bonded with Excite and polymerized by QTH. Statistical analysis showed statistically significant differences between the experimental groups (p value = 0. 03). Conclusion: Under the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that two curing systems of LED 2 & QTH are equally effective on shear bond strength of different <b>bonding</b> <b>agents,</b> whereas Clearfil SE <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> produces higher shear bond strength than Excite total-etch regardless of the type of light-curing unit.

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} antibacterial activity of newer dentin <b>bonding</b> <b>agents</b> on Streptococcus mutans using the direct contact test. Materials and Methods: Streptococcus mutans was used as test organism and a direct contact test was performed. The dentin <b>bonding</b> <b>agents</b> to be tested were grouped as Group I, Clearfil Protect Bond, Group II, Adper Easy One, and Group III, Prime and Bond NT. For the direct contact test, three microtiter plates consisting of 96 wells each were taken (288 wells). These wells were divided into three groups of 96 wells; 16 wells of a microtiter plate were utilized, of which four were designated as ′A′ wells (with the dentin <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> and bacterial suspension), another four as ′B′ wells (without the dentin <b>bonding</b> <b>agent,</b> but with the bacterial suspension), another four as the ′C′ wells (with the tested material, but without bacteria, which served as the negative control), and the remaining four as the ′D′ wells (without the dentin <b>bonding</b> <b>agent,</b> which served as the positive control). Each group was treated with their respective <b>bonding</b> <b>agents</b> as per the manufactures instructions. Broth of 15 mL was then transferred from the A wells into an adjacent set of B wells containing fresh medium (215 mL). This resulted in two sets of four wells for each tested material containing an equal volume of liquid medium, so that bacterial growth was monitored both in the presence {{and in the absence}} of the tested material. The plate was placed for incubation at 37 °C in the microplate reader and the optical density in each well was measured at 600 nm. The readings were taken at regular intervals. (Every 30 minutes for 16 hours). Results: The Dentin <b>bonding</b> <b>agents</b> evaluated in this study showed different inhibitory effects. Clearfil Protect Bond and Prime and Bond NT were most effective, and Adper Easy One was least effective against Streptococcus mutans. Interpretation and Conclusion: The Dentin <b>bonding</b> <b>agents</b> evaluated in this study showed different inhibitory effects. Clearfil Protect Bond and Prime and Bond NT were most effective, and Adper Easy One was the least effective against Streptococcus mutans. Hence, the incorporation of antibacterial agents into the dentin <b>bonding</b> <b>agents</b> may become an essential factor in inhibiting residual bacteria in the cavity and secondary caries...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to answer}} the question: Does the use of <b>bonding</b> <b>agents</b> and cobalt {{chromium}} alloys with variable degrees of rigidity {{have an effect on}} the bonding strength of metal fused to ceramic systems? The 3 point flexural test of SCHWICKERATH (DIN EN ISO 9693) served as the basis for the studies. Test samples included omitting or including the <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> NP Bond® (VITA) and choosing either a more stable (Wirobond® 280) or more flexible dental alloy (Wirobond® C) (BEGO). The used ceramic was VMK Master® (VITA). One series of test samples contained six test pieces and was varied in some parameters of production, like changing wash firing-/bonder-firing-temperature, long-term or rapid cooling and being stored in a corrosion-solution (DIN EN ISO 10271) for one or six months. By combining these parameters in different ways a total of 32 test series were produced. After the flexural test, their fractured surfaces were analyzed under a microscope. The results lead to the following conclusions: -When using Wirobond® 280, the difference between omitting and using <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> was not pronounced. However, rising the bonder-firing-temperature should be avoided. Therefore, manufacturer’s instructions should be observed when using the system “Wirobond® 280 /NP Bond®”. -The use of Wirobond® C indicated a trend towards omitting <b>bonding</b> <b>agent.</b> This was caused by slightly higher bond strengths and two statistically significant differences in the averages towards omitting <b>bonding</b> <b>agent.</b> →In summary, the benefit of using a <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> has to be tested specifically for the foreseen metal fused to ceramic system. If there isn’t a stronger compound when using <b>bonding</b> <b>agent,</b> like with Wirobond® 280, a financial aspect has to be considered. -When omitting <b>bonding</b> <b>agent,</b> some trends are displayed towards using Wirobond® C, with higher bond strengths and three statistically significant differences in averages. -The use of <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> did not show any definite differences between both dental alloys. →In summary, one can expect slightly increased bond strengths when using the system “Wirobond® C / VMK Master®” compared to Wirobond® 280. Additionally, Wirobond® C seems to be more resistant to variations in firing-temperature and the type of cooling due to consistently high bond strengths. The results have to be observed critically, because one should not rely on a single testing method. Furthermore, the influence of various flexible dental alloys on the compound was inconclusive. However, the feasibility of evaluating the specific influence of the elastic modulus on bond strength in a metal-fused-to-ceramic-system is questionable...|$|R
