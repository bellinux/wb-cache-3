40|$|Abstract – Seed-borne {{diseases}} are increasingly becoming important in organic farming, therefore effective seed treatment methods are urgently needed. Physical methods have efficacy against {{a number of}} seed-borne pathogens, but may have adverse effects if applied at too high intensity. Thermal treatment in water has the widest application. To control the <b>loose</b> <b>smuts</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> and barley {{it is still the}} only available non-chemical sanitation method. Other physical treatment methods with practical relevance in cereals are hot humid air and electron treatment. Hot water treatment is also known to control different seed-borne pathogens of vegetables. Various preparations of microorganisms, plant extracts and other agents of natural origin have been and are still being tested in cereals and vegetables. In cereals, some of them are already applied commercially. ...|$|R
40|$|The most {{economic}} and {{effective way to}} control <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> is {{by the development of}} resistant cultivars. This study was conducted to screen tetraploid species <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> resistant to Ustilago tritici races, to investigate the genetic similarities among different races of U. tritici, to determine the genetic control of resistance to race T 33 in three crosses and to identify molecular markers linked to <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> resistance. About 160 selected lines of tetraploid species of Triticum carthlicum, T. dicoccoides, T. dicoccum, T. polonicum, T. turanicum, and T. turgidum were screened for resistance to three races (T 33, T 32, and T 26). The highest percentage of resistant lines was observed in three species, T. carthlicum, T. dicoccoides, and T. dicoccum to the three races of U. tritici. T. polonicum, T. turanicum, and T. turgidum had a lower percentage of resistant lines. Twenty races of U. tritici collected from durum and bread wheat were analysed to assess the degree of similarity based on molecular genetic data. Cluster analysis indicated that races collected from durum and bread wheat did not have any consistent grouping according to the wheat species they were collected from. Three crosses (Stewart 63 x Biodur, DT 662 x D 93213, and D 93221 x DT 658) were evaluated to determine the inheritance of resistance to race T 33 of U. tritici. In Stewart 63 x Biodur, resistance appeared to be dominant and under the control of more than one gene, probably one major gene along with minor gene(s). Resistance in DT 662 x D 93213 was dominant and controlled by a single gene whereas in D 93221 x DT 658, resistance was recessive and conditioned by three genes. Although, allelic studies were not conclusive, the presence <b>of</b> <b>smutted</b> progenies from crosses among the resistant parents as well as the results of molecular studies indicate that the resistance genes studied may not be allelic. To identify molecular markers linked to <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> resistance, bulked segregant analysis was used to screen two recombinant inbred populations from the crosses Stewart 63 x Biodur and DT 662 x D 93213. In the Stewart 63 x Biodur population, five Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers were identified. Two markers were on one side <b>of</b> a <b>smut</b> resistance locus at a distance of 19. 3 cM whereas three markers were on the other side at a distance of 15. 5 cM. Marker E 32 /M 55 R accounted for up to 41 &# 37; of the disease reaction variability. Since these markers were flanking the smut resistance locus, they can be effectively used for marker-assisted selection despite being loosely linked. In DT 662 x D 93213, five markers including two AFLP, two wheat microsatellites (WMS) and one Sequence Characterized Amplified Region (SCAR) were identified. The SCAR marker was on the one side <b>of</b> a <b>smut</b> resistance locus at a distance of 3. 2 cM and accounted for up to 64 &# 37; of the disease reaction variability whereas the other markers were on the other side <b>of</b> the <b>smut</b> resistance locus at distances ranging from 5. 9 cM to 35. 9 cM...|$|R

40|$|With the aim to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of techniques and measures for control of cereal bunts and smuts in organic farming systems, field trials were carried out in multiple locations from 2004 to 2006. The relevant fungal diseases included in the trials were common bunt (Tilletia tritici), dwarf bunt (T. controversa), loose smut (Usti-lago tritici, U. nuda), covered smut (U. hordei) and black loose smut (U. avenae). The following treatments were found to be effective. Common bunt: different physical methods, Tillecur, acetic acid. Loose smut of barley and wheat: warm and hot water treatment, seed treatment with ethanol (more trials needed). Covered smut of barley: warm water treatment, ethanol, Lebermooser. Loose smut of oats: hot water treat-ment, ethanol. Field resistant varieties are available (although in some cases only in limited number) for common bunt, <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> and barley and covered smut.

40|$|<b>Loose</b> <b>smut</b> <b>of</b> barley, {{caused by}} Ustilago nuda (Jens.) Rostr., is {{commonly}} controlled {{through the use}} of systemic seed-treatment fungicides. The most widely used active ingredient in these fungicides has been carboxin. However, isolates of U. nuda resistant to carboxin have been reported in France. In 1996 and 1997, unsatisfactory levels <b>of</b> <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> <b>of</b> barley were observed near Perugia (central Italy), despite the treatment of the barley seed with a carboxin-based fungicide. An isolate of U. nuda (97 - 255) was collected from this field to determine if the pathogen had developed resistance to carboxin. Germination tests on carboxin-amended agar media indicated that isolate 97 - 255 was more resistant to carboxin than a wild type isolate of U. nuda collected in Canada. In tests in which isolate 97 - 255 was inoculated onto barley cv. Regal, the percentage <b>of</b> <b>smutted</b> plants arising from the inoculated seed was not reduced by a carboxin seed treatment.

40|$|<b>Loose</b> <b>smut</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> is {{a disease}} of world wide significance. Resistant cultivars {{constitute}} a potentially useful and environmentally benign method of controlling this disease. The genetic basis of resistance in 20 wheat genotypes with resistance to Ustilago tritici race T 11 was studied in crosses with the widely grown but susceptible Indian cultivar, PBW 343. These lines were also involved in 10 ‘resistant × resistant’ crosses, to infer diversity for resistance genes in this set. All 30 crosses were developed to the F 3 stage. Fifteen parents were inferred to carry dominant genes for resistance to race T 11. Ten of these resistant lines (ML 521, W 59, W 1616, W 2484, W 2531, W 5915, W 6202, WL 1786, WL 2956 and WL 3450) had resistance controlled by 2 dominant genes acting in a complementary manner whereas in 4 lines (W 4461, W 5100, W 2615 and WL 3951), there was a single dominant gene and in a single genotype, WL 5907, there were 2 dominant genes with duplicate gene action governing the resistance. In lines W 2139, W 3899, W 4985, W 5450 and W 5792 a single recessive gene conferred resistance. Inheritance in two crosses, one derived from a line possessing a single dominant gene and the other from a line possessing a single recessive gene was re-analyzed and successfully confirmed in F 5 generation.

Of the major seed-borne diseases, <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> (Ustilago tritic) and flag smut of wheat (Urocystis tritic) were widely prevalent {{in all the}} four provinces of Pakistan; partial bunt or karnal bunt (Neovossia indica) in the central, northern Punjab and NWFP whereas complete bunt or stinking smut (Ti 11 etia foetida) was confined in the uplands of Balochistan and hilly areas of Punjab and NWFP. In the non-irrigated areas Fusarium spp., and in irrigated areas Alternaria sp., and Drechs 1 era spp., were associated with seed rot, foot rot and seedling blight of wheat. Of the seed-borne diseases of rice, blast disease of rice (Pyricu 1 aria oryzae) was a major disease in the central the arts of Punjab and a minor disease in Sindh, brown leaf spot of rice (Drechs 1 era oryzae) and kernel bunt of rice and barc 1 ayana) were prevalent in all the rice growing areas of Pakistan Using standard blotter, agar plate and deep freezing methods, 17 genera and 40 species of fungi Were isolated and identified from 450 seed samples of wheat and 26 genera and 54 species of fungi from 200 seed samples of rice.

The significant risk of seed infection was registered in years with high humidity in the pre-harvest and harvest period. Therefore, along with the traditional seed control {{it is necessary to}} conduct phytopahtology expertise, allowing to identify the species composition of the microflora of seeds and the degree of infection with different pathogens. Smut disease - a solid and <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheat,</b> hard and loose smut of barley - cause crop losses are clear - {{in the form of the}} destruction of the ear, and hidden - in the form of a reduction in seed germination, reduce winter hardiness, plant growth inhibition. Pathogens root rot causing blight, Fusarium and Helminthosporium that insignificantly demand on environmental conditions and extremely plastic. They have large set of enzymes that can exist on a variety of substrates, and therefore are widely distributed in nature and cause considerable damage to crops. Especially significant losses occur if the humidity during the ripening grain observed for several seasons, which leads to accumulation of the infection naturally. The aim of research was to assess the contamination of grain of spring wheat and barley phytopathogenic fungi in one of the main grain regions of Ukraine - the southern forest. The research conducted during the summer 2014 and compared with the results of previous years. Samples were taken from different plots. Seed contamination of samples by various phytopathogenic fungi was determined by the number of infected kernels per 100 seed sample. Frequency of registered species was recorded. For every studied sample we set the percentage of species. Analysis of the grain on the fungal infection and avdelenie in pure culture was performed according to the procedures used a method of washing and centrifugation, seeds, embryos analysis method, biological method based on the stimulation of development and growth of pathogens in the infected seeds during seed germination in nutrient media. We analyzed 200 samples of wheat and barley grain with 8 games on the definition of the infestation and root rot spores solid and smut. In all the samples studied was dominated latent form of infection grains (outwardly healthy, germinating, well executed seeds had normal luster, patina fungus was absent); but sometimes observed apparent lesion (plaque formation, a different degree of deformation of grains). When the microscope isolated fungi was established dominance of species such as fungi of the genera Alternaria, Helmintosporium, Fusarium, smut fungi. The research of cereal seeds showed that all the tested party for the harvest in 2014 were infected with different pathogens in different degrees. On the basis of literature data and our own observations, comparing infection rates average cereal seeds complex fungal diseases, it may be noted that in 2014 the percentage of infestation was higher than in previous years, there is a trend of growth in incidence. The results showed that the overall percentage of infected root rots seeds of spring wheat in 2014 was 55. 5 %, the infestation of spring barley was 64. 7 %. Compared to previous years the trend increase in the prevalence of fungal diseases on cereals: wheat infestation grew by 12. 8 %, barley - 2. 13 %. Smut infected - 11. 2 % wheat, barley - 37. 4 %. Infection bunt was 4. 6 %, including 3. 3 % of wheat; Barley 17. 6 %. The growth and development of root rot during the growing season depended on the presence of soil infection. Infection of grain crops by smut diseases depend on the quality of seed sown. Reducing the prevalence of smut disease is possible at early winter and late spring sowing to prevent the spore germination at low temperature.

The goals were to: 1) phenotypically characterize, linkage map and identify putative marker(s) linked to loci governing resistance, and 2) to assess whether resistance from this population conferred a negative yield effect in the absence of the pathogen. A linkage map was constructed with data from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping of the population, in conjunction with both field and greenhouse the phenotypic disease assessments. The map was comprised of 34 linkage groups (LGs), with a major resistance gene mapping to the terminus of linkage group (LG) 11 and a minor resistance gene mapping to LG 19.

40|$|Growing of {{resistant}} cultivars is {{the most}} effective and ecological way to prevent losses due to the <b>loose</b> <b>smut,</b> a disease prevalent in farming without seed treatments. In the present poster, the resistance level to <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> in some <b>of</b> the European oat cultivars and genebank accessions is described. For the inoculation of seed a vacuum-based method was used. The inoculum consisted of two loose-smut collections with different virulences. In all resistance screenings, inoculation was done at 800 mbar vacuum pressure and with an aqueous spore suspension of 1 g/litre. Resistance evaluations were started with a glasshouse experiment with 216 genebank A. sativa accessions and 40 oat breeding lines or differentials, followed by the nursery experiment at two locations examining 100 cultivars and lines, respectively, and were completed with a glasshouse experiment with 60 oat lines. The resistance screening at two locations and the two glasshouse screenings revealed at least 8 modern cultivars and 11 genebank accessions with very high levels of resistance. A highly significant correlation coefficient between glasshouse and nursery examination was found, whereby the glasshouse conditions were favourable for testing under a high disease pressure. Among the entries suitable for growing under ecological conditions, the smut-resistant cvs. 'Neklan', 'Jumbo', 'Firth', 'Hamel', 'Boxer', 'Auteuil' and 'Chantilly' are recommended. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelu...|$|R
40|$|Fifty-five {{spring barley}} {{varieties}} from the German official varieties list were tested for their susceptibility to <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> (Ustilago nuda) and covered smut (Ustilago hordei) under a simulation of natural infection conditions. For <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> infection cv. ‘Lawina’ with about 5 % infected plants {{was used as}} spreader. In the trial with covered <b>smut</b> 1 kg <b>of</b> seeds were shaken with 1 g of spores to contaminate the surface of barley seeds before sowing. Only ‘Steffi’ stayed absolutely free from <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> during two infection cycles at two locations. With an average of 12. 6 % plants with <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> ‘Danuta’ was the most susceptible. Most susceptible to covered smut were ‘Tunika’ with 13. 2 % and hulless ‘Taiga’ with 15 % infected plants. Thirteen varieties remained free <b>of</b> covered <b>smut.</b> Among these ‘Auriga’, ‘Hendrix’, ‘Jacinta’ and ‘Sigrid’ showed a low <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> infection with always less than 1 %. No correlation between <b>loose</b> and covered <b>smut</b> susceptibility could be detected. Under organic farming a variety with a susceptibility below 1 % under natural infection could be acceptable for maintaining seeds on farm, but for organic seed multiplication during all generations from breeding to production more <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> resistant varieties are necessary to fulfil the demands of current seed regulations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUstilago tritici causes <b>loose</b> <b>smut,</b> {{which is}} a seed-borne fungal disease <b>of</b> <b>wheat,</b> and {{responsible}} for yield losses up to 40 %. <b>Loose</b> <b>smut</b> {{is a threat to}} seed production in developing countries where small scale farmers use their own harvest as seed material. The killer protein 4 (KP 4) is a virally encoded toxin from Ustilago maydis and inhibits growth of susceptible races of fungi from the Ustilaginales. Enhanced resistance in KP 4 wheat to stinking smut, which is caused by Tilletia caries, had been reported earlier. We show that KP 4 in genetically engineered wheat increased resistance to <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> up to 60 % compared to the non-KP 4 control under greenhouse conditions. This enhanced resistance is dose and race dependent. The overexpression of the transgene kp 4 and its effect on fungal growth have indirect effects on the expression of endogenous pathogen defense genes...|$|R

40|$|The {{main control}} <b>of</b> <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> is the {{selection}} of varieties that flower with a closed flower. Seed lots infected by <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> can be treated with fungicides, and this is regularly used in conventional agriculture. Environmental concern {{has focused on the}} use of pesticides for seed treatment, and in organic farming pesticides cannot be used at all. Hence, there is a growing demand for non-chemical measures to control seed borne pathogens like <b>loose</b> <b>smut.</b> The flowers {{in the top of the}} barley head normally flowers more openly than the flowers in the centre or the bottom of the head, and the seed developed in these flowers are statistically smaller. It is also possible that the presence of mycelium in the embryo reduces the filling of the seed. Removal of the smallest fraction of the barley seed from a seed lot will hence reduce the infection level <b>of</b> <b>loose</b> <b>smut.</b> Previous studies on the effect of seed separation on the infection level <b>of</b> <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> have only investigated the effect of seed size in terms of the width of the seed. However, it is possible that other characters of the seed development are affected, e. g. the density of the seed. The aim of this experiment is to investigate the effect of different seed separation techniques on the infection level <b>of</b> <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> in infected seed lots. Materials and methods Seed samples of barley were collected from fields, where <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> was observed in the growing season. The seed sample was cleaned by laboratory models of the standard equipment used by most commercial seed companies. Results and Discussion The experiment confirms that conventional seed cleaning affects the infection level <b>of</b> <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> in a seed lot. When the seed lot was separated only by the seed size, only the largest seed fraction (> 2. 8 mm) had significantly lower frequency <b>of</b> <b>smut</b> infection. As only 2...|$|R
