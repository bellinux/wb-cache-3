500|$|... {{was about}} how when my grandma was {{standing}} over my grandfather {{while he was}} dying. There was this moment where I felt like he had sort of <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> reckoned that he had won in life. Like, 'I'm a champion. We won. Our love made us a winner.' They were married 60 years. I thought about that idea, that the glorious moment of your life is when you decide that it's okay to go, you don’t have any more words to say, more business, more mountains to climb. You're on the cliff, you tip your hat to yourself and you go. That’s what {{it was for me}} in that moment when I witnessed it." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics praised Warrior for its {{rock music}} influences, despite the album being {{deeply rooted in}} technopop. Applauding the album's rock sound, Rolling Stone called the album Kesha's rock manifesto. Rock icons The Flaming Lips, Iggy Pop, and Alice Cooper have collaborated with Kesha, {{endorsing}} her as a rock singer. Cooper told Billboard, [...] "I immediately <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> went, 'This girl is not a pop diva. She's a rock singer.' She would much rather be the female Robert Plant than the next Britney Spears." [...] The A.V. Club noted that Warrior proved Kesha a capable vocalist and songwriter. The Washington Post said that the album is [...] "pure fun", acknowledging her prowess for finding good hooks despite her sometimes vapid lyricism.|$|E

[...] The original cover painting by Alberto Vargas {{was one of}} his last works, created at the age of 84. According to The New York Daily News, Peters [...] "persuaded him to do one last 'Vargas Girls' portrait...

2500|$|The {{song was}} written by singer-songwriter Alicia Keys and samples R singer Loleatta Holloway's [...] "We're Getting Stronger" [...] from Holloway's 1976 debut LP.

Houston said for MTV News that “When she performed at one of [...] parties the year before last, I kind of <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> it was when she had [...] record out, and it was the only record that came on the radio that inspired me”. “I walked over to her, and off the cuff said, ‘Hey, do you think you could produce me?’ She said, ‘Yeah, I think I can,’ ” Houston explained.|$|E
2500|$|At age 12, Tallchief {{began to}} work with Bronislava Nijinska, a renowned {{choreographer}} who had recently opened her own studio in Los Angeles, and David Lichine, a choreographer and former dancer. Nijinska [...] "was a personification of what ballet was all about", Tallchief recalled. [...] "I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> I knew this was what I wanted to do." [...] Nijinska imparted {{a strong sense of}} discipline and the belief that being a ballerina was a full-time task. [...] "We didn't concentrate only {{for an hour and a}} half a day", Tallchief recalled. [...] "We lived it". It was under Nijinska that Tallchief decided ballet was what she wanted to devote her life to. [...] "Before Nijinska, I liked ballet but believed that I was destined to become a concert pianist", she recalled. [...] "Now my goal was different." [...] Nijinska saw Tallchief was serious and began devoting great attention to her.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why should I?" [...] said Grandcourt, {{with his}} inward voice, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> then {{choosing}} an orange--for {{they were at}} table.|$|R
6000|$|She did not reply. He {{continued}} to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> presently asked, in a gentler tone:--"Where did {{you wish to}} go, lady?" ...|$|R

60|$|Walter <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> {{had one of}} his odd visitations of prophecy.|$|E
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{a little}} puzzled. The glow upon <b>her</b> face <b>and</b> the {{sunlight}} upon her brown hair kept him silent. He {{was content to}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> wonder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bravely. Anne {{contrived}} our carrying <b>her</b> up-stairs, <b>and</b> it is {{the greatest}} comfort to Raymond to lie <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> Susan <b>looks</b> after them both." ...|$|R
