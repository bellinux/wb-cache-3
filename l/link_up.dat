5|$|During {{the night}} of 10/11 April, XLIX Mountain Corps was ordered to bridge the Savinja river at Celje, then advance towards Brežice on the Sava, and LI Infantry Corps was {{directed}} to <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with the 14th Panzer Division which would then drive west to Karlovac. The Italians were expected to commence offensive action by attacking southwards to <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with the 14th Panzer Division {{in the vicinity of}} Karlovac.|$|E
5|$|The brigade now {{came under}} command of XXI Corps and at 01:45 on 8 November {{was ordered to}} move west of Beit Hanun and <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with the Australian Mounted Division, which was {{advancing}} from the east. As they moved {{to the east of}} Beit Hanun, the XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment, which was still attached to the brigade, came under heavy machine-gun and artillery fire, preventing the brigade from advancing further. The Turkish bombardment continued until 12:20, when they were observed withdrawing. The XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment and Mysore Lancers were ordered to encircle and cut off their retreat, however dug in Turkish positions at the Wadi Hesi once again halted the brigade advance. At 15:00 that day the brigade eventually made contact with the 4th Light Horse Brigade, completing the <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with the Australian Mounted Division.|$|E
5|$|The <b>link</b> <b>up</b> {{occurred}} on 3 December {{and the following}} day a composite force from the 2/32nd and 2/43rd Infantry Battalions took over the advance to the Christmas Hills, which were secured on 7 December after the Japanese abandoned the position {{in the wake of}} a series of flanking moves by the Australians, an intense artillery and mortar bombardment and a frontal assault.|$|E

5|$|These probes {{intensified}} on 30 March, {{as one of}} the 25th Infantry Battalion's companies {{was strongly}} attacked by the Japanese. The Australian position had been weakened by having about a third of its strength out on patrol {{at the time of the}} attack. Unable to return to the perimeter while the company was under fire, they were forced to <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with one of the other companies further north. Meanwhile, the company was attacked four times throughout the day. The first three attacks were repulsed before the last attack came at 13:00, preceded by a heavy mortar bombardment. Twelve Japanese were killed in the attack, while one Australian was killed and two were missing in action. Nevertheless, the Australian position had been made untenable and they were forced to withdraw and <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with the company to the north. In doing so they left behind three mortars and a quantity of ammunition which the Japanese later brought into action against them.|$|E
5|$|About 23:00, German 2nd Army {{headquarters}} {{directed the}} 14th Panzer Division to penetrate past Zagreb towards Karlovac to <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with the Italian 2nd Army, and also directed the 8th Panzer Division and 16th Motorised Infantry Division {{to drive to}} the north of Belgrade to <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with the First Panzer Group which was thrusting towards Belgrade from the east. At midnight, 2nd Army headquarters declared that the Yugoslav northern front had been decisively defeated, and tasked corps engineer units to consolidate bridging across major rivers, particularly over the Sava at Brežice west of Zagreb to facilitate the advance of the 14th Panzer Division towards Karlovac. The main body units of the XLVI Motorised Corps moved forward to Virovitica and Slatina, and 2nd Army headquarters moved forward to establish itself in Maribor, protected by the 538th Frontier Guard Division. At midnight, General der Panzertruppe Heinrich von Vietinghoff issued orders for the 8th Panzer Division to continue towards Belgrade via Osijek, but directed the 16th Motorised Infantry Division to thrust west as far as Sremska Mitrovica then turn south to drive towards Sarajevo via Zvornik.|$|E
5|$|After their {{defeat the}} Royalists {{effectively}} abandoned Northern England, losing {{much of the}} manpower from the northern counties of England (which were strongly Royalist in sympathy) and also losing access to the European continent through the ports on the North Sea coast. Although they partially retrieved their fortunes with victories {{later in the year}} in Southern England, the loss of the north was to prove a fatal handicap the next year, when they tried unsuccessfully to <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with the Scottish Royalists under the Marquess of Montrose.|$|E

Some of the other battalions that participated in the battle also incurred heavy losses. Elliott managed to <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with elements of the 21st Battalion, the commander of which recommended him for the VC. Elliott was evacuated to hospital where he spent three months recovering from his various wounds before {{he returned to his}} battalion in September.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the first}} day's {{landings}} on 17September were successful, over {{the night of}} 17–18September, divisional commander Major-General Roy Urquhart was reported missing so Brigadier Philip Hicks of 1st Airlanding Brigade assumed command of the division on September18. Subsequent problems in Arnhem forced Hicks to change the divisional plan. Only the 2nd Parachute Battalion had reached the road bridge as strong German defences had stopped the other battalions. Hicks decided that the 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment and 11 Para would <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with the 1st Parachute Brigade {{in an attempt to}} reach their objective.|$|E
5|$|Belgian plans did {{not call}} for the {{garrison}} of the fort and the attached defending forces to fight a sustained battle against an attacking force; {{it was assumed that}} sufficient warning of an attack would be given so that the detachment on {{the eastern side of the}} canal could be withdrawn, the bridges destroyed and the garrison ready to fight a delaying action. The defending force would then retire to the main defensive positions along the River Dyle, where they would <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with other Allied forces.|$|E

5|$|Between 24 April and 1 May, the IX Army {{fought a}} desperate action {{to break out}} of the pocket in an attempt to <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with the XII Army. Hitler assumed that after a {{successful}} breakout from the pocket, the IX Army could combine forces with the XII Army and would be able to relieve Berlin. There is no evidence to suggest that Generals Heinrici, Busse, or Wenck thought that this was even remotely strategically feasible, but Hitler's agreement to allow the IX Army to break through Soviet lines allowed many German soldiers to escape to the west and surrender to the United States Army.|$|E
5|$|Egypt {{invaded the}} newly {{declared}} State of Israel on May 15, 1948. Their strength was approximately one division, commanded by Major General Ahmed Ali al-Mwawi. Their advance was three-pronged: The main column moved north through what is today the Gaza Strip and attacked Kfar Darom, another column went east toward Beersheba, {{and a third}} attacked kibbutz Nirim. On May 17, a small force split off from Beersheba to <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with more Egyptian forces at Auja al-Hafir, on May 19 the main column attacked Yad Mordechai, and on May 20, the main force in Beersheba set out to link with the Jordanian Arab Legion in Hebron.|$|E
5|$|In February 1944 it {{joined the}} élite British Special Air Service (SAS) Brigade and was renamed the 5th SAS Regiment in March, {{even though it}} was only battalion-strength.

In July 1944, the small groups from 5th SAS were dropped by parachute into northern France to perform reconnaissance and sabotage missions and to <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with the French Resistance. Amongst their missions was to harass the German retreat from the Falaise Gap.|$|E

5|$|In mid-June 1941, the {{division}} received new orders to relocate. The 16th Panzer Division crossed the German–Polish border at Groß Wartenberg heading for Ożarów at the Vistula, which was reached on 19 June 1941. The German soldiers initially {{believed that they}} were just going to transit through Russia, {{on their way to the}} Middle East where they would <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with Erwin Rommel's Afrika Corps. But Generalfeldmarschall (Field Marshal) Walther von Reichenau, who visited his son, a Leutnant in the 4th company of Panzer-Regiment 2, revealed to them the true objective of the next campaign. It would be Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In outline, the XV Mountain Corps {{plan was}} for a heavy aerial {{bombardment}} of Partisan positions in and around Drvar by Luftwaffe aircraft, followed by a parachute and glider assault by the 500th SS Parachute Battalion who had the task of capturing or killing Tito and destroying his headquarters. The assault also included tasks to capture or destroy the Allied military missions to the Partisans. On the same day, ground elements of XV Mountain Corps were to converge on Drvar to <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with the 500th SS Parachute Battalion. A small reconnaissance aircraft was tasked to fly into Drvar after its capture to retrieve Tito or his body.|$|E

5|$|On 24 June, the 1st Krajina Corps of the VRS {{began the}} {{offensive}} codenamed Operation Corridor 92. Its first {{objective was to}} break through the HVO and HV-held positions between Modriča and Gradačac, and <b>link</b> <b>up</b> with the East Bosnian Corps. The secondary effort consisted of attacks towards Derventa and Bosanski Brod. The first objective was achieved after two days of heavy combat on 26 June. Afterwards, the VRS advanced towards Modriča and captured the town on 28 June. The secondary advances, facing considerably stiffer resistance by the HVO and the HV, gained little ground.|$|E
