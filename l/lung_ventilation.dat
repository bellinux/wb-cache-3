5|$|The right lung of {{the river}} otter {{is larger than the}} left, having four lobes {{compared}} with two for the left. Reduced lobulation of the lungs is presumed to be adaptive for underwater swimming. In addition, the length of the trachea {{of the river}} otter is intermediate between that of terrestrial carnivores and marine mammals. The mean tracheal length of the river otter is , or 23.2% of the body length. A shorter trachea may improve air exchange and increase <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation</b> in diving mammals.|$|E
25|$|Helium-3 nuclei have an {{intrinsic}} nuclear spin of , and {{a relatively high}} magnetogyric ratio. Helium-3 can be hyperpolarized using non-equilibrium means such as spin-exchange optical pumping. During this process, circularly polarized infrared laser light, tuned to the appropriate wavelength, is used to excite electrons in an alkali metal, such as caesium or rubidium inside a sealed glass vessel. The angular momentum is transferred from the alkali metal electrons to the noble gas nuclei through collisions. In essence, this process effectively aligns the nuclear spins with the magnetic field {{in order to enhance}} the NMR signal. The hyperpolarized gas may then be stored at pressures of 10 atm, for up to 100 hours. Following inhalation, gas mixtures containing the hyperpolarized helium-3 gas can be imaged with an MRI scanner to produce anatomical and functional images of <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation.</b> This technique is also able to produce images of the airway tree, locate unventilated defects, measure the alveolar oxygen partial pressure, and measure the ventilation/perfusion ratio. This technique may be critical for the diagnosis and treatment management of chronic respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, cystic fibrosis, and asthma.|$|E
500|$|Varanus salvadorii has mammal-like aerobic abilities; this is {{accomplished}} {{by means of a}} positive pressure gular pump in the animal’s throat to assist <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation.</b> [...] The majority of lizards cannot run and breathe at the same time due to Carrier's constraint, but monitor lizards are exceptions to this rule. [...] The development of this ventilatory pump is analogous to the evolution of the diaphragm in mammals, which ventilates the lung independently of locomotion; scientists place V. salvadorii as the species with the highest endurance in this regard. This would suggest the lizard is at an evolutionary midpoint, relying on both forms of breathing.|$|E
5000|$|Control of {{ventilation}} {{refers to}} the physiological mechanisms involved in the control of breathing, which is the movement of air {{into and out of}} the <b>lungs.</b> <b>Ventilation</b> facilitates respiration.

Thus any cause that influences the rate or volume of air entering the <b>lungs</b> (<b>ventilation)</b> or any cause that influences the transfer of air from the lungs to the blood may cause hypoxemia.

40|$|Introduction: Research {{into the}} {{prevention}} of ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI) in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) {{in the intensive care}} unit (ICU) has resulted in the development of a number of lung protective strategies, which have become commonplace in the treatment of critically ill patients. An increasing number of studies have applied <b>lung</b> protective <b>ventilation</b> in the operating room to otherwise healthy individuals. We review the history of lung protective strategies in patients with acute respiratory failure and explore their use patients undergoing mechanical ventilation during general anesthesia to provide context for a discussion of the benefits and drawbacks, as well as inform future areas of inquiry. Methods: We completed a database search and reviewed articles investigating <b>lung</b> protective <b>ventilation</b> in both the ICU and in patients receiving general anesthesia through May 2015. Results: <b>Lung</b> protective <b>ventilation</b> was associated with improved outcomes in patients with acute respiratory failure in the ICU. Clinical evidence is less clear regarding <b>lung</b> protective <b>ventilation</b> for patients undergoing surgery. Conclusion: <b>Lung</b> protective <b>ventilation</b> strategies including low tidal volume ventilation and moderate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) are well established therapies to minimize lung injury in critically ill patients with and without lung disease, and may provide benefit to patients undergoing general anesthesia...|$|R
2500|$|Early sauropodomorphs, {{including}} the group traditionally called [...] "prosauropods", {{may also have}} had air sacs. Although possible pneumatic indentations {{have been found in}} Plateosaurus and Thecodontosaurus, the indentations are very small. One study in 2007 concluded that prosauropods likely had abdominal and cervical air sacs, based on the evidence for them in sister taxa (theropods and sauropods). The study concluded {{that it was impossible to}} determine whether prosauropods had a bird-like flow-through lung, but that the air sacs were almost certainly present. A further indication for the presence of air sacs and their use in <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation</b> comes from a reconstruction of the air exchange volume (the volume of air exchanged with each breath) of Plateosaurus, which when expressed as a ratio of air volume per body weight at 29nbsp&ml/kg is similar to values of geese and other birds, and much higher than typical mammalian values.|$|E
2500|$|All {{reptiles}} breathe using lungs. Aquatic turtles {{have developed}} more permeable skin, and some species have modified their cloaca {{to increase the}} area for gas exchange. Even with these adaptations, breathing is never fully accomplished without lungs. <b>Lung</b> <b>ventilation</b> is accomplished differently in each main reptile group. In squamates, the lungs are ventilated almost exclusively by the axial musculature. This is also the same musculature that is used during locomotion. Because of this constraint, most squamates are forced to hold their breath during intense runs. Some, however, {{have found a way}} around it. Varanids, and a few other lizard species, employ buccal pumping as a complement to their normal [...] "axial breathing". This allows the animals to completely fill their lungs during intense locomotion, and thus remain aerobically active for a long time. Tegu lizards are known to possess a proto-diaphragm, which separates the pulmonary cavity from the visceral cavity. While not actually capable of movement, it does allow for greater lung inflation, by taking the weight of the viscera off the lungs.|$|E

40|$|<b>Lung</b> {{protective}} <b>ventilation</b> utilizes low tidal volumes {{to ventilate}} patients with severe lung pathologies.
