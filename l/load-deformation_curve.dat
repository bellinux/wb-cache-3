We simulated an animal model of isokinetic eccentric exercise by repetitively stretching stimulated triceps surae muscle-tendon units {{to determine if}} such exercise affects the mechanical properties of the unit within its physiologic excursion. Methods Biomechanical parameters of the muscle-tendon unit were monitored during isokinetic eccentric loading in 12 rabbits. In each animal, one limb (control group) was stretched until failure. The other limb (study group) was first subjected to isokinetic and eccentric cyclic loading {{at the rate of}} 10. 0 cm/min to 112 % (group I) or 120 % (group II) of its initial length for 1 hour and then stretched to failure. Load-deformation curves and biomechanical parameters were compared between the study and control groups. Results When the muscle-tendon unit received eccentric cyclic loading to 112 %, changes in all biomechanical parameters – except for the slope of the <b>load-deformation</b> <b>curve</b> – were not significant. In contrast, most parameters, including the slope of the <b>load-deformation</b> <b>curve,</b> peak load, deformation at peak load, total energy absorption, and energy absorption before peak load, significantly decreased after isokinetic eccentric cyclic loading to 120 %.

40|$|Objectives: Soft tissue {{exhibits}} nonlinear stress-strain behavior under compression. Characterizing its nonlinear elasticity may aid detection, diagnosis, {{and treatment}} of soft tissue abnormality. The {{purposes of this study}} were to develop a rate-controlled Mechano-Acoustic Indentor System and a corresponding finite element optimization method to extract nonlinear elastic parameters of soft tissue and evaluate its test-retest reliability. Methods: An indentor system using a linear actuator to drive a force-sensitive probe with a tip-mounted ultrasound transducer was developed. Twenty independent sites at the upper lateral quadrant of the buttock from 11 asymptomatic subjects (7 men and 4 women from a chiropractic college) were indented at 6 % per second for 3 sessions, each consisting of 5 trials. Tissue thickness, force at 25 % deformation, and area under the <b>load-deformation</b> <b>curve</b> from 0 % to 25 % deformation were calculated. Optimized hyperelastic parameters of the soft tissue were calculated with a finite element model using a first-order Ogden material model. Load-deformation response on a standardized block was then simulated, and the corresponding area and force parameters were calculated. Between-trials repeatability and test-retest reliability of each parameter were evaluated using coefficients of variation and intraclass correlation coefficients, respectively. Results: Load-deformation responses were highly reproducible under repeated measurements. Coefficients of variation of tissue thickness, area under the <b>load-deformation</b> <b>curve</b> from 0 % to 25 % deformation, and force at 25 % deformation averaged 0. 51 %, 2. 31 %, and 2. 23 %, respectively.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the test-retest reliability and the repeatability over multiple days of a robotic testing device when used to measure laxity of the lower leg during a simulated dial test. METHODS: Ten healthy subjects were evaluated using an instrumented robotic lower leg testing system over 4 days. Three testing cycles were performed each day. Each leg was rotated into external and then internal rotation by servomotors until a torque threshold of 5. 65 N m was reached. Load-deformation curves were generated from torque and rotation data. Both average-measure and single-measure intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were compared across the curves. ICC scores were also compared for features of the curves including: maximum external rotation at - 5. 65 N m of torque, maximum internal rotation at 5. 65 N m of torque, rotation at torque 0, compliance (slope of <b>load-deformation</b> <b>curve)</b> at torque 0, endpoint compliance in external rotation, endpoint compliance in internal rotation, and play at torque 0. Play at torque 0 was defined as the width of the hysteresis curve at torque 0. RESULTS: Average-measure ICC scores and test-retest scores were > 0. 95 along the entire <b>load-deformation</b> <b>curve</b> except around zero torque. ICC scores at maximum internal and external rotation ranged from 0. 87 to 0. 99 across the left and right knees. ICC scores for the other features of the curves ranged from 0. 61 to 0. 98. The standard error of the mean ranged from 0. 0497 to 1. 1712. CONCLUSIONS: The robotic testing device in this study proved to be reliable for testing a subject multiple times both within the same day and over multiple days. These findings suggest that the device can provide a level of reliability in rotational testing that allows for clinical use of test results.

40|$|There several {{failure modes}} that are {{considered}} in the available codes and standards in field of pressure vessel and piping. One of these failure modes is plastic instability. This failure mode {{is defined as the}} pressure for which the components/structures approach dimensional instability (large deformation), i. e. unbounded displacement for a small increment in the applied load. In order to find this pressure both large deformation and strain hardening curve are considered. When the slope of numerically generated <b>load-deformation</b> <b>curve</b> approaching zero the corresponding applied load is considered as plastic instability load. Unlike cylindrical and spherical pressure vessels, available theoretical solution in range of plastic instability load for conical shells are very limited. Hence, it would be very useful to predict the behavior of these components with acceptable accuracy for design purposes. Analytical expressions are derived to determined plastic instability load of s conical shell subjected to internal pressure and when it is subjected to hydrostatic pressure (i. e., storage tanks). The geometrical changes can be estimated using the proposed solutions when considering the material strain hardening curve. ...|$|E
40|$|Anchor bolts {{are often}} used in {{concrete}} or steel structures. Nevertheless still empirical design procedures are used {{in order to determine}} the dimensions of the structure. Non linear fracture mechanics tries to describe fracture of heterogeneous materials like concrete. In the classical representation of concrete fracturing (figure 1. 1), cohesive forces in the micro-crack-zone (ahead of the cracktip) contribute to the carrying capacity of the structure and cause softening of concrete. This concretesoftening can also be explained by discontinuous cracks that grow along aggregate particles and cause bridging of the cracks (crack-face bridging, see Van Mier (1991)). Insight in non linear fracture mechanics as well as increasing computer techniques finally gave the opportunity to investigate the behaviour of anchor bolts embedded in concrete in a proper way.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study is to propose a {{stiffness}} reduction factor for flat plate systems under lateral loads. According to current design provisions, slab stiffness under lateral loads should account for stiffness reduction due to the effects of cracks. Several researchers have conducted for evaluating the stiffness reduction in flat plate slab systems under lateral loads. However, no research is found for establishing strength reduction factor with respect to the level of applied moment. This study attempted to propose equations for calculating stiffness reduction factor with respect to the level of applied moment (Ma) represented by the ratio of Ma to the cracking moment of the slab (Mcr). For this purpose, test results of 20 interior slab-column connections were collected. For each specimen, stiffness reduction was measured with respect to Ma/Mcr. To verify the proposed factor, this study conducted the experimental test of interior connection under quasi-static cyclic loading, from which <b>load-deformation</b> <b>curve</b> was obtained.

It is shown that (1) seismic wave type has significant influence on structure response due to different frequency components it contained; (2) the vertical input of seismic wave greatly affected structure response in vertical direction, while it has little impacts in horizontal direction; (3) base mat uplift is easier to take place in soil with higher shear velocity; (4) structure H/B value has complicated influence on base mat uplift.
