40|$|Properly {{assessing}} proposed aviation policies {{requires a}} thorough trade study of noise, emissions, fuel consumption, and cost. Aircraft low-speed aerodynamic performance {{is an important}} driver of all these impacts, and this thesis presents {{the development of an}} aerodynamic tool capable of accurately estimating key low-speed performance characteristics using aircraft geometry information typical of that available in the preliminary phase of aircraft design. The goal of this thesis is to use the low-speed aerodynamic estimates to present the sensitivity of aircraft noise to aircraft configuration and operational procedures, and then to identify improved procedures to reduce the cost, fuel use, and noise of current aircraft. The low-speed aerodynamic method developed in this work is comparable to aircraft manufacturer initial design tools. It requires about fifteen seconds on a modem computer and has been developed to a sufficient level of accuracy through a calibration study using Boeing flight test data, NASA wind tunnel results, and an empirically-tuned Lockheed method. The low-speed method is generally capable of predicting a drag polar, drag as a function of lift, to within one-percent. It also determines the changes of the drag polar due to high-lift devices, both slat and flap deployment, to within about three-percent. In addition, the method contains correlations to predict the variations of lift with angle of attack and the maximum lift coefficient; these predictions have errors around ten-percent and five-percent, respectively. The estimates produced by the method are of appropriate fidelity to properly model aircraft flight trajectories for fuel bum and noise estimates within larger environmental impact assessment models. (cont.) The results of simulations of the mandated takeoff and <b>landing</b> <b>noise</b> certification procedure show that noise is reduced insignificantly by small modifications to the airframe. This is largely because, for the current aircraft fleet, engine noise dominates both takeoff and <b>landing</b> <b>noise,</b> and only methods to reduce the required thrust or increase the aircraft altitude will significantly decrease noise. For landing, significant reductions in noise, on the order of 12 %, were found by increasing the approach speed, which decreases required thrust, and by steepening the approach path, which keeps the aircraft higher above the ground when outside the airport boundaries. The results of an optimization study estimating the Pareto Frontier of departure procedures for a 747 - 200 aircraft show that compared to the standard departure at maximum takeoff weight, a reduction in time to climb of two minutes, in fuel consumption of 1, 300 Ibm, and in land area exposed to a sound level 55 EPNdB of 100 square miles can be mutually achieved. by Andrew March.

The presented topics are {{in support of}} the NASA subsonic fixed wing project, which seeks to lower noise and increase performance by improving prediction methods and technologies. The aircraft configurations used for study are the N 2 A, using conventional podded engines, and the N 2 B, using an embedded propulsion system. Preliminary FAR Part 36 noise certification assessments are completed using the NASA Aircraft Noise Prediction Program (ANOPP). The limitations of applying current ANOPP noise prediction methods to hybrid wing-body aircraft are investigated. Improvements are made to the landing gear and airfoil self-noise modules, while a diffraction integral method is implemented in a companion thesis to enhance noise shielding estimates. The N 2 A overall takeoff and <b>landing</b> <b>noise</b> estimate is found to be 5. 3 EPNdB higher than the N+ 2 goal. The dominant noise sources are the fan rearward and jet on takeoff and the main landing gear and elevons on approach. A lower fan pressure ratio and advanced landing gear fairings are recommended to decrease N 2 A overall noise levels. The available engine noise estimation tools were inadequate to model the N 2 B distributed propulsion system and rectangular exhaust nozzle; therefore, overall N 2 B aircraft noise results are presented for reference only. A simplified embedded propulsion system integration study is carried out to explore the N 2 B fan design space. A 2 -D computational domain with contoured slip boundaries around the centerbody is used to replicate the effects of 3 -D relief on the airframe and inlet aerodynamics. The domain includes the S-shaped inlet duct and is extended far downstream for a Trefftz plane power balance analysis to determine the propulsive power required for steady level flight. A fan actuator volume is included to couple the airframe external and the engine internal flows. Aircraft power savings, fan efficiency, and boundary layer thickness trends are examined to determine if increasing fan face Mach number improves system performance while mitigating the total pressure distortion risk of boundary layer ingestion. A fan face Mach number near 0. 7 is found to increase aircraft power savings 12 % relative to the baseline design and to reduce centerbody boundary layer kinetic energy thickness by 4. 7 %. In addition, power balances at lower fan pressure ratios as fan face Mach number increases suggesting that high-flow low pressure ratio fans are desirable for BLI. by Philip Andrew Weed. Thesis (S.

40|$|Presented at the 2 nd World Aviation Congress and Exposition, Anaheim, CA, October 13 - 16, 1997. As {{an element}} of a design {{optimization}} study of high speed civil transport (HSCT), response surface equations (RSEs) were developed {{with the goal of}} accurately predicting the sideline, takeoff, and approach noise levels for any combination of selected design variables. These RSEs were needed during vehicle synthesis to constrain the aircraft design to meet FAR 36, Stage 3 noise levels. Development of the RSEs was useful as an application of response surface methodology to a previously untested discipline. Noise levels were predicted using the Aircraft Noise Prediction Program (ANOPP), with additional corrections to account for inlet and exhaust duct lining, mixer-ejector nozzles, multiple fan stages, and wing reflection. The fan, jet, and airframe contributions were considered in the aircraft source noise prediction. Since takeoff and <b>landing</b> <b>noise</b> levels are a function of both engine design variables and flight path variables, several possible approaches to the problem were considered. The first method would have required developing an RSE which is a function of low-speed aerodynamics and engine design variables, by using the Flight Optimization System (FLOPS) computer program to calculate the takeoff performance and passing the flight path to ANOPP. The second method required development of an RSE which is a function of engine cycle variables and flight path variables. The latter approach was chosen for this study, primarily for its simplicity and ease of integration of the final RSEs into FLOPS. Pareto plots are provided showing the estimated effect of each of the variables on the variation in the noise levels. Screening studies showed that the variation in sideline noise was dominated by jet parameters [...] such as mass flow, area, total pressure, and suppressor area ratio [...] while fan variables and climb velocity played a smaller role. Takeoff noise was similarly affected, except that the sensitivity to the jet variables was diminished, and cutback altitude was shown to have a significant effect. Approach noise was controlled almost completely by fan variables. The most important variables were chosen {{for each of the three}} noise levels, and separate response surface equations were developed for two-, three-, and four-stage fans using a central composite design of profiles for each equation. The sideline and takeoff noise RSEs all exhibited good fit with the data, and the trends were as expected. The approach noise RSEs exhibited lower R[superscript] 2 values, indicating a poorer fit with the data. It was determined that this behavior was caused by correlation in the design matrix, resulting in significant errors in the estimation of the second-order RSE coefficients. Problems with the approach RSEs were eliminated when their development was repeated using a face-centered form of the CCD.

This can be roughly defined to start at about 2000 ft altitude above ground level and ends with the aircraft’s touch down. Accordingly, <b>landing</b> gear <b>noise</b> is a significant contributor to both, the certification noise level as well as community noise levels. Past and current research activities on <b>landing</b> gear <b>noise</b> focused at a first glance on the noise generated due to the interaction between a turbulent flow and the landing gear structure such as wheels and brakes, struts, links and dressings. Less emphasis was spent {{on the fact that}} the main landing gear related wake impinges on the flap and thus could generate landing gear wake – flap interaction noise. The aim of the present study was to identify and quantify gear wake flap interaction noise. The study is based on flyover noise measurement data gathered in 2004 in the mainframe of the German national funded research project FREQUENZ. Noise tests were conducted with an Airbus A 319 100 aircraft which can be considered representative for the fleet of narrow body short and medium range aircraft. The obtained results can be summarized as follows: gear wake flap interaction noise increases the airframe noise signature by up to 3 dB at medium frequencies and is most pronounced for forward and rear arc radiation directions. High as well as very low frequency noise levels are not significantly contributing to gear wake - flap interaction noise.

The stimuli were two DC- 8 jet <b>landing</b> <b>noises</b> (each 30 seconds in duration and coming from DC- 8 aircraft with and without acoustical treatment on the engine nacelles) and a 4 -second burst of pink noise. Each of the noises was tested at nominal intensities of 61 and 79 dBA. Other physical descriptors of the noises were measured or computed. The results indicate that for an equivalent degree of sleep disruption, noise form the jet aircraft with untreated nacelles must be about 6 dBA less intense than the jet with acoustically treated nacelles. Predictions {{of the effects of}} noise on sleep appear, tentatively, to attain the highest accuracy when the physical descriptor of noise intensity includes information about the impulsive characteristics of that noise as well as its long-term spectral content.

40|$|The {{negative}} impact of aircraft noise includes effects on population's health, land use planning and economic issues such as building restrictions and operating restrictions for airports. Thus, the reduction of noise generated by aircraft at take-off and approach is an essential consideration {{in the development of}} new commercial aircraft. Among the different aircraft <b>noise</b> sources, <b>landing</b> gear <b>noise</b> {{is one of the most}} significant during approach. This research presents results from the European Clean Sky funded ALLEGRA project, which investigated a full-scale Nose Landing Gear (NLG) model featuring the belly fuselage, bay cavity and hydraulic dressing. Tests were performed for a variety of wind speeds and yaw angles. In this paper, a characterization of thenoise generated by the full-scale Nose Landing Gear (NLG) model is presented and the different techniques used for characterizing acoustic sources on the NLG are described. The <b>landing</b> gear <b>noise</b> source is characterized in terms of OASPL, directivity, source spectra, PNL and PNLT. A comparison between the NLG with and without the application of low noise technology is presented. © 2015 by ASME...|$|R
