The author may feel that the final portrayal is far too flattering in certain places, while the reader who neglects to read between the lines may think the biographer could have been a little more sympathetic at times. Death alone will open this Pandora's box." [...] Morrison himself is quoted on the first page of the book, saying: [...] "Rogan's got something to hide. What's he hiding?

500|$|MadWorld was {{the first}} game to be released. Produced by Inaba, the game was {{designed}} {{to appeal to a}} western audience and had a unique art style inspired by that of Sin City. The original story was written by Yasumi Matsuno, who had previously worked on Square Enix's Ogre Battle and Final Fantasy Tactics, while PlatinumGames and Sega jointly localized the title for the West. The team created the game with a vision of bringing a unique game to the Wii. One of the game's main themes is violence and brutality which led to controversy as it tarnished the family-friendly image of the Wii console. While the game received positive reviews, it was a commercial failure, selling poorly in both Japan and the West, despite Sega's heavy marketing. Though the game was a commercial failure, Sega felt that sales were [...] "encouraging", and said that they would continue to make mature games for the Wii. They released the Welcome To Violence pack, which bundles MadWorld with , and The Conduit, each of which were commercial failures. In 2010, Sega announced that they would cease publishing mature video games for the Wii, citing the disappointing sales of MadWorld as a contributing factor. However, PlatinumGames announced several days later that they would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> sequel to the game.|$|E

Before SpongeBob SquarePants aired on television in 1999, Hillenburg had approached band guitarist Dean Ween to compose a song for the show. Dean Ween said [...] " [...] called {{me and told me}} [...] was a marine biologist who was starting a cartoon about underwater sea creatures and that The Mollusk was a big reference point for him creatively and would we <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> song for the show." [...] The band conceived the song and wrote it in about three minutes. Ween's 1997 song [...] "Ocean Man" [...] would also be used four years later during the end credits sequence in The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, and as part of the film's soundtrack.

2500|$|Several {{years after}} {{receiving}} favorable reception in Poetic Justice, Jackson decided {{to attempt a}} romantic comedy. Jackson had been offered leading roles in The Matrix, X-Men, and Jerry Maguire, {{but was unable to}} accept each due to touring. After auditioning, Jackson was cast as Professor Denise Gaines opposite Eddie Murphy. When asked to contribute a single, Jackson said she would consider the idea if she found an appropriate song. The film's producers were eager for Jackson's contribution, but had initially not approached her regarding fears of rejection, leading Jackson to initiate. Director Peter Segal brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios in April, where Jackson had begun recording All for You.

[...] Segal told Jackson she was an exceptional actress after becoming convinced she truly loved Murphy's character, leading Jackson to suggest writing an up-tempo love song rather than a ballad.|$|E

My initial idea was to create a guitar that had a Les Paul-type of sustain and sweetness of the trebles and had the kind of crunch and definition of a Tele or Strat on the basses. From <b>doing</b> repairs for <b>a</b> number of years, I knew it wasn’t the construction, the stiffness of the neck, or the types of wood causing these tonal things.
