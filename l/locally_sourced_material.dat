A parabolic trough solar collector uses Aluminium sheet {{in the shape of}} a parabolic cylinder to reflect and concentrate sun radiations towards an absorber tube located at the focus line of the parabolic cylinder. The receiver absorbs the incoming radiations and transforms them into thermal energy, the latter being transported and collected by a fluid medium circulating within the absorber tube. The Designing and Fabrication of parabolic trough solar water heater for water heating was executed, the procedure employed includes design, construction and testing stages. The model which is made up of reflector surface, reflector support, absorber pipe and a stand with manual tracking arrangement was fabricated using <b>locally</b> <b>sourced</b> <b>material</b> for rural applications point of view.

40|$|The {{discharge}} of dye-containing effluents into the aquatic environment represents {{a source of}} aesthetic pollution with associated negative effects. Photocatalytic degradation {{has been identified as}} a suitable means of treating these effluents. In this study, the potential of a <b>locally</b> <b>sourced</b> <b>material,</b> periwinkle shell ash (PSA), has been explored as an effective photocatalyst for the photocatalytic decolourisation of tartrazine in aqueous solution. The efficiency of the photocatalyst was evaluated by investigating the effects of operational variables such as irradiation time, initial dye concentration and catalyst loading on the extent of decolourisation. The results show that the optimum levels of the variables were 50 minutes, 30 mg/L and 5 g/L for irradiation time, initial dye concentration and catalyst loading respectively. The pseudo first order and the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic models were able to sufficiently describe the kinetics of the process. The diffusion mechanism was described by the intra-particle diffusion model while the adsorption equilibrium was described by the Langmuir isotherm equation. The results obtained indicate that PSA can be used as an effective photocatalyst for the removal of tartrazine from aqueous solution. ...|$|E
40|$|In certain situations, sand is {{required}} to have extra shear strength to provide more safety, stability and support for structures. Shear strength in sand arises from friction and resistance between particles. The most common means of increasing the shear strength of sand is the cementation method. Another practice is using an additive such as slag. Some studies show that wood has also been used to improve soil strength, mostly for soft and expansive soil. However, there is limited information available on sand. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} research is to determine whether the shear strength of a sand-slag mixture is affected by the addition of wood. Baldivis sand, a <b>locally</b> <b>sourced</b> <b>material,</b> was used in the experiment because it has been widely used in construction and geotechnical projects in Western Australia. The shear strength of the sand-slag-wood material was determined using an automated direct shear testing machine. There were a number of variations in test conditions, including as the amount of wood introduced into the sand-slag, the percentage of slag in the sand, the gaps between the wood, and wood orientation. The results showed that the shear strength of the sand-slag mixture tended to be enhanced by the presence of wood. The sand-slag mixture containing wood seemed to be stronger than the sand-slag without wood or the pure sand. The position of the wood also contributed to the improvement in shear strength. Placing the wood vertical to the shear direction resulted in greater strength than when the wood was positioned horizontally. From these results, it can be concluded that wood is another potential means of enhancing the shear strength of sand-slag mixture. The quantity of wood and the way it is arranged, such as distance and direction, may result in different levels of improvement to the shear strength of the sand-slag...|$|E
40|$|Current {{debates on}} design and {{manufacturing}} support {{the claim that}} the ‘Third Industrial Revolution’ has already started due to Additive Manufacturing (AM) and 3 D Printing. The process of solidifying liquid or powder using a binding agent or a melting laser can save time and transportation costs associated with importing primary material if <b>locally</b> <b>sourced</b> <b>material</b> is available. This research investigates a framework approach, titled SAFE, for discussing the functionality, economic viability, production feasibility, and aesthetic and cultural value lent by 3 D printing on an architectural scale through a construction known as a Mashrabiya. This traditional window screen has distinguished aesthetic, cultural yet functional constraints, and there is a manufacturing gap in the market that makes it a viable product option to be 3 D printed. The practical element and design process related to reviving this screen are examined, from complex geometry development to cost and fabrication estimations. 3 D printing technologies potentially offer solutions to solve issues in construction and assembly times, reduce labour costs, and address the loss of hand craft making skills in a variety of cultures, typically Middle Eastern ones; this was a factor in the abandonment of old Mashrabiya in houses typified with Bahrain as a case. Presently, there is a growing wealth of literature that highlights not only the strength of Mashrabiya as a design concept but also as a possible 3 D printed product. Interviews with a total of 42 local Bahraini manufacturers, academics and architects as well as 4 case studies and 2 surveys and 11 focus groups are hybrid mixed methods used to define a new 3 D printed Mashrabiya (3 DPM) prototype. The future of the 3 D Mashrabiya prototype is further supported by economic forecasts, market research, and interviews with global manufacturers and 3 D printing designers’ insights into the subject in an accretive design process. The research contributes {{to an understanding of the}} implications of technologies that enable mass customisation in the field of 3 D-printed architecture in general and in the Bahraini market in particular. The process for developing a prototype screen and in determining its current economic value will prove significant in predicting the future benefits and obstacles of 3 D-printed large scale architectural products in the coming five years as advised by industry experts. The main outcomes relate to establishing boundaries determining the validity of using 3 D printing and a SAFE framework to produce a parametric Mashrabiya and other similar heritage architectural archetypes. This can be used to enhance the globalism of the design of Middle Eastern dwellings and to revive social identity and cultural traditions through innovative and reasonable yet superior design solutions using a hybrid architectural design language...|$|E

40|$|The {{provision}} of high quality, potable {{water in a}} sustainable and effective manner is a key challenge for water engineers, scientists, and policy makers. Urbanisation and industrial development, along with population growth, intensification of agriculture and climate change, has increased the strain on current potable water supplies in the developed world, {{not only in terms}} of supply, but also by way of introducing new contaminants into the abstraction waters. Emerging contaminants, alongside increasingly stringent environmental legislation, make the maximum allowable concentrations for various contaminants within potable water more difficult to achieve. Although the situation is improving, over 660 million people worldwide still do not have access to improved water supplies. Sustainable and robust solutions that ensure effective water treatment for a variety of contaminants, while also being low cost and low maintenance, are required. Metals and nutrients continue to enter source water supplies by anthropogenic and natural sources. While metals can be damaging to human health, nutrients can lead to excessive microbial activity. The presence of organic matter in source waters also challenges water treatment plants (WTPs), as disinfectants used post-treatment can trigger a reaction with organic matter to create toxic by-products. These can develop both in the WTP and along the distribution network, and long-term exposure can be detrimental to human health. This is a major problem in Ireland and elsewhere, and to date, no cost-effective and sustainable solution has been found. Various technologies are being developed to target problem contaminants, including coagulation systems, gas transfer systems, oxidation technologies, and membranes. Although these may be effective, they may also require high capital investment, be subject to fouling, and require expert maintenance. In addition, costly treatment systems are not feasible for smaller water treatment facilities and developing countries. Instead, a move towards more traditional contaminant removal and retention mechanisms, such as adsorption and filtration, may be more sustainable. Such technologies, in tandem with the use of alternative filter media, such as waste products and <b>locally</b> <b>sourced</b> <b>material,</b> can improve the sustainability of WTPs while not negatively impacting performance. This study aimed to address the issue of contaminant removal, by designing a filter that could fit into the current model of a WTP, and which could remove a variety of contaminants including metals, nutrients, and disinfection by-product precursors. The technology incorporated the use of waste materials to reduce cost and maintain sustainability, and was comprehensively tested at laboratory-scale and pilot-scale. A number of waste products and local materials were first tested at bench-scale, using a variety of common water contaminants to assess their adsorptive capacities. The media tested included coarse sand, zeolite, granular activated carbon (GAC), pyritic fill, Bayer residue, bottom ash, fly ash, and granular blast furnace slag. Following this, laboratory-scale stratified filters were constructed, comprising some of the most successful media from the bench-scale study: fly ash, Bayer residue, zeolite, sand, and GAC. The filters were evaluated for treatment performance and media clogging potential. The results obtained from the laboratory-scale study led to a re-design for the pilotscale study, which was operated at a WTP that used lake water as its potable water source. The WTP was chosen as it had a history of formation of disinfection byproducts. Two filter configurations were examined under intermittent and constant loading rates, and comprised combinations of sand, Bayer residue, GAC, and pyritic fill. While each of the alternative designs proved more successful than a standard sand filter, a filter configuration comprising sand, GAC, and pyritic fill, proved most effective in dissolved organic carbon removal under a continuous loading regime. These studies show that waste products can be used in filtration technologies, where adsorption is a key mechanism, thereby reducing overall capital and maintenance requirements. Adsorption isotherms are instrumental in the design of bespoke filters, and this study found that it is possible to target the removal of specific contaminants, depending on the constituents of the source water. This study presents a simple, lowmaintenance design to reduce the concentration of key contaminants in potable water, and addresses a major problem for WTPs...|$|E
