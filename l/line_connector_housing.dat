40|$|A {{process for}} making RF {{shielded}} cable connector assemblies {{and the resulting}} structures is described. The process basically consists of potting wires of a shielded cable between the cable shield and a <b>connector</b> <b>housing</b> to fill in, support, regidize, and insulate the individual wires contained in the cable. The formed potting is coated with an electrically conductive material so as to form an entirely encompassing adhering conductive path between the cable shield and the metallic <b>connector</b> <b>housing.</b> A protective jacket is thereby formed over the conductive coating between the cable shield and the <b>connector</b> <b>housing...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{apparatus}} and assembly for connecting beams and like structural members is disclosed which is particularly advantageous for connecting two members which are moved laterally into place. The connector apparatus requires no relative longitudinal movement between {{the ends of}} the beams or members being connected to make a connection joint.

50|$|For example, a dial-up {{computer}} modem {{is generally}} provided with two <b>line</b> <b>connectors,</b> often labelled <b>line</b> and phone. The outside line {{is connected to}} the <b>line</b> <b>connector,</b> and handsets may be connected to the phone connector. When the modem is not in use, the line {{is connected to the}} handsets, but when the modem is in use, the phone connector is disconnected from the outside line. This prevents accidental interruption of the data service by raising the handset, which could occur if the two devices were simply connected in parallel.|$|R
50|$|The powerCON is an {{electrical}} connector manufactured by Neutrik for connecting mains power to equipment {{in a small}} space.

5000|$|A Speakon {{connector}} {{is designed}} with a locking system {{that may be}} designed for soldered or screw-type connections. <b>Line</b> <b>connectors</b> (female) mate with (male) panel connectors and typically a cable will have identical connectors at both ends. If it is needed to join cables, a coupler can be used (which essentially consists of two panel connectors mounted {{on the ends of}} a plastic tube). Recently the manufacturer has introduced a new series called STX which includes also male <b>line</b> <b>connectors</b> and female panel Speakon connectors are designed to be unambiguous in their use in speaker cables. With 1/4" [...] speaker jacks and XLR connections, it is possible for users to erroneously use low-current shielded microphone or instrument cables in a high-current speaker application. Speakon cables are intended solely for use in high current audio applications.|$|R

40|$|Environmental testing under laboratory-controlled {{conditions}} {{has long}} been used to evaluate connector performance prior to practical application. There {{are a number of}} experimental procedures frequently used in the automotive industry such as the USCAR standard for automotive electrical connector systems to test connectors. However, recent research has shown that these tests appear to evaluate the mechanical stability of the connector housings and terminals, rather than their electrical performance. In order to establish more representative tests to evaluate the electrical performance of contacts, the actual environmental conditions at the contact interface, which are generally unknown, must be measured. This paper compares the temperature, humidity, and air pressure inside the <b>connector</b> <b>housing</b> to those measured outside. It was found that the conditions inside and outside the <b>connector</b> <b>housing</b> are different and a model relating the conditions is introduced...|$|R

50|$|Hybrid {{connectors}} have housings with inserts {{that allow}} the intermixing of many connector types, such as those mentioned above. These housings may also allow intermixing of electrical and non-electrical interfaces, examples of the latter being pneumatic <b>line</b> <b>connectors,</b> and optical fiber connectors. Because hybrid connectors are modular in nature, they tend to simplify assembly, repair, and future modifications. They also allow the creation of composite cable assemblies that can reduce equipment installation time by {{reducing the number of}} individual cable and connector assemblies.|$|R

40|$|Defective {{electrical}} connections in power distribution systems will result many circuit and equipment failures. Power distribution loss reduction and power system reliability improvement are becoming very important vicinities to be investigated. There are several methods available for power distribution loss reduction. Energy losses by connectors installed in power distribution network {{is one of}} the highly concerned. Quality of power line connections directly affects the power system reliability. Compression connectors or compression joints are a popular type of connectors used for joining or terminating conductors in power distribution network. Identification of good workman practices for power distribution line connections is important to make the power system more reliable. Standardization of process of power <b>line</b> <b>connector</b> installation and proper die selection technique for compression connectors is essential for power system reliability improvements. This study is an attempt to identify good workman practices required for making perfect power distribution line connections. This will be a guide in the assembly and preventive maintenance of efficient {{electrical connections}} for power distribution circuits. An efficient connection shows minimum resistance, both at initial assembly and in the long run. Data and experience gained through usage on power <b>line</b> <b>connectors</b> by Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is the basis of this study. The results of tests carried out on power distribution line connections are incorporated in the recommendations. Properties of conductor metals and metal oxides are discussed. These illustrate requirements of recommended methods of making connections. Requirement for the proper selection of connectors, the proper preparation of conductors, and the proper application of fusion, compression, and bolted connectors are identified. Standards available on power <b>line</b> <b>connectors</b> are discussed to illustrate effective workman practices. Photographs of bad workman practices are included with explanations. Mathematical formula is developed for calculating correct die size for compression connectors. Amount of material available in connector and conductor are compared with area inside the suggested die for determining the correct die size. Performance identification of any type of connector installed in a power line is carried out by thermal imaging. Thermal images taken from few installed connectors are included and a procedure for assessing connector performance is suggested...|$|R
