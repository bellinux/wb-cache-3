25|$|Cornell is {{a common}} rival in all sports; hockey games against Cornell are major events on campus, with {{students}} <b>lining</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> hours before the game {{in order to secure}} tickets. Colgate's teams (with the exception of football, golf, and men's hockey) also compete annually against Syracuse University. Cornell and Syracuse are both within two hours of Colgate's campus. Colgate and Syracuse were once bitter rivals in football (there are some old traditions related to their games), but a variety of factors, including the splitting of Division I football into Division I FBS and Division I FCS in the late 1970s, helped end the annual game, with some exceptions (such as 2010) over the years. Their men's lacrosse rivalry remains fierce.|$|E
25|$|In 1216 the mercenaries of Stedingen swung over to {{the party}} of Gerhard I, who promised to respect their freedom, and {{attacked}} the city of Bremen, loyal to Valdemar. HenryV rescued the city with his troops. In 1217 the city of Bremen deserted Valdemar's party. Now HenryV, OttoIV and their troops ravaged the Prince-Archbishopric (so-called Valdemarian Turmoils, 1217–1218). In 1218 GerhardI and ValdemarII allied to expel Henry and Otto from the Prince-Archbishopric. Gerhard's troops approached the fortress of Vörde disguised as sick, <b>lining</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> a treatment by the faith healer and farmer Otbert. Once arrived they overthrew Henry's soldiers in the fortress. After the deaths of Otto in 1218 and GerhardI in 1219, HenryV reached {{an agreement with the}} new Prince-Archbishop Gerhard II, to maintain the County of Stade as prince-archiepiscopal vassal.|$|E

500|$|Bush was a {{participant}} in the 2006 midterm elections, beginning her campaigning in April. Though her poll numbers had decreased from an 80% approval rating, they still superseded that of President Bush, whose approval rating was only praised by a third of Americans. Ed Henry of CNN noted Bush's popularity, writing, [...] "The first lady is treated like a rock star on the campaign trail– with local Republicans <b>lining</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> photographs and autographs– as she criss-crosses the country to help candidates." [...] Bush relied on a strategy of praising the Republican candidate for their achievements and attending events alongside them.

Six tanks rumble {{to the outskirts of}} Holtzwihr, split into groups of threes, and fan out toward either side of the clearing. Then wave after wave of white dots, barely discernible against the background of snow, start across the field. They are enemy infantrymen". The Germans scored a direct hit on an M10 tank destroyer, setting it on fire and causing its crew to abandon it. Murphy ordered his men to retreat to positions in the woods, remaining alone at his post shooting his M1 carbine and relaying orders via his telephone while the Germans aimed fire directly at his position. Murphy mounted the abandoned, burning tank destroyer and began firing its [...]50 caliber machine gun at the advancing Germans, killing a squad crawling through a ditch towards him.|$|E

[...] When the party reached the municipality of Niagara Falls, they transferred to carriages to see the sights. [...] The party rode halfway across the Honeymoon Bridge overlooking the Falls, though McKinley was careful not to enter Canada for reasons of protocol. [...] It was a hot day, and Ida McKinley felt ill due to the heat; she was driven to the International Hotel to await her husband, who toured Goat Island before joining his wife for lunch. [...] After smoking a cigar on the veranda, the President rode with his wife to the train which now awaited them nearby, and saw her settled there before touring the hydroelectric plant at the Falls. [...] The train then returned to Buffalo so McKinley could attend the reception at the Temple of Music. [...] Ida McKinley had originally intended to accompany her husband to the auditorium, but as she was not fully recovered, she decided to return to the Milburn House to rest. [...] As the time allotted for the reception had been pared down to ten minutes, the President did not expect to be separated from his wife for long.

Once the rest of the army had fled, he and the thousand men escaped as well.

2500|$|On 21 January 2007, {{the flight}} data {{recorder}} (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR), colloquially called by media black boxes, were located {{off the coast of}} West Sulawesi by the US vessel Mary Sears. The {{flight data recorder}} was located at [...] at a depth of , while the cockpit voice recorder was located at [...] at a depth of [...] These positions indicate the black boxes were located approximately [...] apart. The Indonesian vessel Fatahillah travelled to the location, while Mary Sears travelled to Singapore, arriving on 29 January to return the detector equipment used to locate the devices. It did not travel immediately to Singapore because it was mapping the immediate area. The Mary Sears used its side scan sonar (SSS) unit to map an area of approximately 10.3km² (3 sq nmi) around the recorders in high resolution, an operation which required 18 passes across the area at approximately , taking six hours per pass including <b>lining</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the next pass. It discovered a large amount of wreckage in the area, which was considered to be all that remained of the aircraft. A senior Indonesian marine official said on 24 January that he did not believe that the equipment required to retrieve the boxes from that depth was available in any Asian country. The black boxes had a battery life of just 30 days, and would subsequently be unable to emit locator signals.|$|E
