40|$|At the Cao Jing {{district}} in Shanghai, China, a landreclamation project is planned. The object {{of this project}} is to stimulate the natural process of sedimentation. This report comprises {{the results of a}} study concerning the optimum lay-out of dikes in the reclamation-area (see Fig. 0. 1 and 0. 2). In this report particularly the influence of the waves (wind-waves and swell) is discussed. In the foregoing report "LAY-OUT part I" the influence of the tidal motion has been discussed. In this analysis the wave-climate at the Cao Jing district has been calculated on the basis of measurements at cape Nan Hui, concerning the waves and wind-speeds. Next, the optimum dimension of the opening-size is determined, based on wave-diffraction. The optimum dimensions of the field (length and distance) are determined by the admissable fetch-length (for wind-generated waves). Finally the height of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dike</b> is optimized, based on wave-transmission. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. According to {{the field}} survey of the damaged {{engineering}} structure suffered the flood on July 23 rd in Danfeng County, it is analyzed that the failure modes and characteristics of elementary and secondary schools, village and small town residence, roads, bridges and others under the effect of extreme loads, such as debris flow, mountain torrent, landslide and so on. Natural environment must be practically protected in the mountainous area easy to suffer natural calamities. What’s more, good flood carrying capacity of the channels must be assured. Site selection of {{all different kinds of}} projects must be serious and careful, and they cannot be located in the ditch mouth of mountain torrents, occupy the flood carrying channels, or be too close to channel bank. Protection works must be set up for the key projects, and the revetment, retaining wall, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dike,</b> spur dike and others should be fully utilized to resist, eliminate, or weaken extreme loads. It is necessary to strengthen the quality supervision of all diverse kinds of projects in the villages and small towns, perfect the design and construction process, and enhance the anti-scouring capability of the foundation of the projects...|$|E
40|$|Fluvial dikes {{have been}} {{constructed}} as flood defense structures, but their failure may lead to casualties and major damages in the protected areas. Flow overtopping is listed as {{the main cause of}} dike failure. An accurate assessment of the breach evolution is a prerequisite to a sound flood risk assessment and management. in contrast, the current knowledge of the physical processes involved in fluvial dike failure by overtopping remains highly fragmented. This paper presents experimental tests on the breaching of homogenous sand-dikes in a fluvial configuration, i. e. the flow is parallel to the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dike</b> axis. Overtopping is initiated over a pilot notch at the dike crest. Experiments are performed for different inflow discharges in the main channel and under different levels of floodplain confinement. The transient evolution of the dike geometry is monitored using a laser profilometry technique. The detailed reconstruction of the breach formation and expansion provides key insights into the mechanisms involved in the failure of fluvial dikes. Results show that the breach development differs highly from experiments disregarding the flow parallel to the dike axis (i. e. frontal configuration) as in the fluvial configuration the breach develops mainly in the flow direction and the floodplain water level strongly conditions the breach horizontal and vertical extent...|$|E
40|$|El objetivo del presente trabajo es el de presentar un cuadro estratigráfico para las sedimentitas del área del Cerro Verdún, Minas, Uruguay. Asimismo presentar algunas consideraciones sobre sus características sedimentológicas y sus estromatolitos, a fin de {{discutir}} sus condiciones paleoambientales. En el mismo sentido, se realizan inferencias sobre la edad abarcada por estas rocas y sus potenciales correlaciones regionales. Esta sucesión ha permanecido indefinida en general, mientras que sus calizas fueron alternativamente asignadas a diversas unidades litoestratigráficas. En esta contribución se incluye al conjunto en el Grupo Mina Verdún, el cual está conformado de base a techo por: i) Formación Don Mario (40 m, base no expuesta, lutitas negras), ii) Formación La Toma (15 m, margas verdes oscuras a negras), iii) Formación El Calabozo (170 m, calizas grises, masivas, laminadas y estromatolíticas) y iv) Formación Gibraltar (60 m, techo no expuesto, dolomías en tonalidades pálidas amarillentas, verdes y rosas hasta gris oscuras más calizas rosas y pelitas y margas negras). Conglomerados polimícticos de la Formación Las Palmas cubren a esta unidad mediante una discordancia angular. En contraposición, las cuarcitas del Cerro Verdún se apoyan sobre el Grupo Mina Verdún por contacto tectónico. Las pelitas negras de la Formación Don Mario se habrían depositado en un ambiente reductor de aguas calmas. Se identifica para las mismas, de manera preliminar, {{un aporte}} desde una corteza continental superior diferenciada que sufrió una importante meteorización y retrabajo. Las margas de la Formación La Toma reflejan un cambio en la sedimentación, con un pasaje hacia un ambiente de rampa carbonática. Niveles con estromatolitos aparecen en las calizas de la Formación El Calabozo, constituidos esencialmente por columnas de laminación cónica asignables a Conophyton fm. y muy escasos estromatolitos columnares dendroides, mal preservados. Conophyton es considerado como un estromatolito submareal de aguas relativamente profundas. Esto último, sumado a la baja diversidad, sugiere un ambiente marino submareal externo para esta unidad. Correlaciones entre afloramientos locales, definirían una evolución desde una rampa carbonática hasta una plataforma, en las inmediaciones del talud de la misma. La edad de esta unidad aún no se conoce con precisión. Sin embargo, interpretaciones geológicas regionales, sobre la base de los estromatolitos presentes y de datos geoquímicos, sugieren un tiempo de depositación post-arqueano a pre-ediacareano. The {{aim of this}} contribution is to introduce the stratigraphic framework of the Mina Verdún Quarry, located in {{the eastern side of}} Verdún Hill, Minas, Uruguay (Fig. 1), and to characterise their sedimentary units. The paleoenvironments involved are outlined as well as the sedimentological significance of the very well developed stromatolites. The stratigraphic position and composition of this sedimentary succession used to be uncertain and the limestone from the Mina Verdún Quarry was alternatively considered part of diverse litostratigraphic units (Mac Millan, 1933; Caorsi and Goñi, 1958; Bossi et al., 1965; Midot, 1984; Preciozzi et al., 1985; Bossi and Navarro, 2000; Sánchez Betucci, 1998; Sánchez Betucci et al., 2001). From the base to the top (Fig. 2), the sedimentary succession consists of the Mina Verdún Group, Las Palmas Formation and the quartzites of the Verdún Hill (Fig. 3). Mina Verdún Group (Poiré et al., 2003 b) is conformed by: Don Mario Formation (Poiré et al., 2003 b) : 40 m thick, base not exposed; massive and laminated, black shales (Fig 4 a), which are rich in organic matter (Fig. 5 a). XRD analysis shows manly quartz, with scarce calcite, clay (illite, chlorite, and IS and CS interlayer) and feldspars (Fig. 6). Applying the Bhatia and Crook (1986), Taylor and McLennan (1985) and McLennan et al. (1990, 1993) plots (Fig. 7) their geochemistry suggests a high degree of weathering and reworking in the source area compose of a differentiated upper continental crust. La Toma Formation (Poiré et al., 2003 b) : 15 m thick; fine-grained, dark green marls (Fig. 4 b and c), bearing up to 45 % of silica and 35 % of CaCO 3. Petrographically they show micritic crystals of calcite and dolomite, quartz and feldspars (Fig. 5 b); lamination is interrupted by stilolytes. Clay minerals are composed mainly by illite and scarce chlorite (Fig. 6). El Calabozo Formation (Poiré et al., 2003 b) : 170 m thick; grey massive, laminated, and stromatolite limestones (Fig. 4 d), bearing up to 93 % of CaCO 3 with some collapse breccias as resulting of probably karstic phenomena. In thin section they show homogeneous mosaic of micrite and subsparite calcite (Fig. 5 c and d) with stilolites and corrugated stromatolite lamination. Very abundant calcite with rare quartz, feldspars and illite have been recorded by XRD (Fig. 6). This sedimentary sequence is affected by diagenetic features and a fragile deformation (cleavage foliation, shear zones) which are slightly hiding the stromatolite morphologies (Fig. 8), but the main features of the stromatolites from El Calabozo Formation are still well preserved. Columnar stromatolites assignable to Conophyton fm. are the most abundant group of these organic sedimentary structures. This Conophyton fm. consists of unbranching subcylindrical columnar stromatolites with strikingly conical internal laminae whose apexes define a distinctive axial zone (Figs. 10 a, b, c) and their horizontal section display a conspicuously and regularly concentric structure (Figs. 10 c, d, f). The internal laminae are commonly continuous from one column to another, in which case vertical sections show upward laminae apexing. Their profile is angulate to geniculate and their plant outline could be round circular to oblong, in which case the axes are strongly orientated. The attitude of the columns is usually straight but sometimes they adopt a recumbent and sinuous posture. The column height is up to 70 cm and the column width is 5 to 20 cm. However, scarce but preserved dendroid branching style stromatolites have been recorded on the field, as well as small, rounded plant outline columnar stromatolites have been observed in cores, which could represent digitate branching stromatolites. Five kilometres to the south, this stromatolitic limestone facies change to deformed laminate limestones (Figs. 4 e, f). Furthermore, 40 km to south, the El Calabozo Formation bearing Conophyton stromatolites has been reported by Gaucher et al. (2004 a). Gibraltar Formation (Poiré et al., 2003 b) : 60 m, top not exposed; black marls and shales (Figs, 10 a, b, c), pink limestones and dolomite limestones, and light yellow, green, reddish, black and grey dolomites (Fig. 10 d, e). The unconformity between the El Calabozo and Gibraltar formations is very irregular, which is interpreted as a karstic palaeorelief. A 4 m thick diagenetic breccia is often in the base of the unit. The Mina Verdún Group is overlaid by red polymictic conglomerates and sandstones (Fig. 10 f) of Las Palmas Formation (Poiré et al., 2003 b) and is intruded by a subvolcanic <b>longitudinal</b> (E-W) <b>dike</b> swarm. This shows a K-Ar whole rock datum of 485, 2 ± 12, 5 Ma considered as a minimum cooling (Gonzalez et al., 2004). The quarzites from the Verdún Hill are overlying these units by a tectonic contact. They have been assigned to the Cerro Espuelitas Formation by Gaucher (2000), which are Ediacarean in age. Sedimentological and stratigraphic implications The black shales and claystones of the Don Mario Formation are interpreted as fine deposits in a low energy environment with euxinic conditions, which becomes calcareous to form a carbonatic ramp (La Toma Formation). The latter shows and evolution to a carbonatic algae platform very rich in stromatolites. From a sedimentological point of view, the group Conophyton has been assigned as a deep subtidal stromatolite by Poiré (1987, 2002) based on Precambrian stromatolite cycles from Villa Mónica Formation, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, and Logan et al. (1964) and Donaldson (1976) ideas. In this sense, the low biodiversity, Conophyton abundance and the plant view axes orientation allow to suggest a subtidal marine environment for the El Calabozo Formation, with tidal currents influence (Fig. 11). The strong dolomitization of the Gibraltar Formation and their poor exposure do not allow doing detailed interpretation about paleoenvironments. The age of the Mina Verdún Group is Precambrian but there are not major precisions about that. Unfortunately, the group Conophyton has a wide range during the Precambrian, from Early Proterozoic to Ediacarean, being impossible to define the age of these limestones. More detailed future studies about microstructure of this Conophyton could be useful to distinguish the taxonomy and to determinate its possible age. Pre-Ediacarean stromatolites have also been described 30 km to the north by Sprechmann et al. (1994) and Gaucher et al. (1996) in the Villalba Formation of the Basal Group (Gaucher y Sprechmann, 1995), but their morphologies are completely different. They have recorded stratiform, nodular-stratiform (LLH-C, LLHV) and columnar (SH-V) stromatolites associated with stromatolitic breccias, which were interpreted as intertidal to supratidal deposits. It could represent shallower stromatolite assemblages than the stromatolites from the Mina Verdún. Unfortunately, there are no radiometric data to prove this idea. Very well developed Conophyton ?ressotti and Conophyton fm. have been also recorded in the dolomites of the Villa Mónica Formation (Poiré, 1993) companied by Colonella fm., Cryptozoon fm., Gongylina fm., Gymnosolem fm., Inzeria fm., Jacutophyton fm., Jurusonia nisvensis, Katavia fm., Kotuikania fm., Kussiella fm., Minjaria fm., Parmites fm., Parmites Cf. cocrescens and Stratifera fm. (Poiré, 1989 y 1993), which radiometric age for diagenesis is 795 My (Cingolani y Bonhomme, 1988). This sequence could be correlated with El Calabozo Formation but it shows a poor biodiversity. The Mina Verdún Group is considered as a new lithostratigraphic unit in the Uruguayan stratigraphic framework, which is probably located somewhere between the Basal and Arroyo del Soldado groups...|$|R

The height and position {{with respect to}} the dike profile, the wind direction and velocity and the percentage of hunting time without wing beating were recorded in 429 cases. The vertical wind angle, 6, the wind speed and its horizontal direction were measured at 13 heights up to 8. 8 m above the windward slope, the top and the leeward slope of the dike under various wind conditions in 225 cases. These wind profile measurements were used to estimate 6 and wind speed near the hanging birds. Kestrels hanging more than 90 % of the hunting time preferred a position 6. 5 ± 1. 5 m (S. D.) over the windward slope with sea winds blowing at 8. 7 ± 1. 5 ms~ 1 (S. D.) perpendicular (± 30 °) to the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dike</b> axis. For these birds angle 6 was approximately 6 - 7 °. These angles are larger than expected from aerodynamic models and wind-tunnel measurements. The minimum gliding angle for a kestrel under steady conditions is estimated to be 5 °. Hanging kestrels save two-thirds of the energy used during normal windhover-ing but have to spend 1. 6 times more time to catch the same number of voles...|$|E
