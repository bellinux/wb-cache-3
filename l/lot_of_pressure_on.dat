40|$|The Australian ageing {{society with}} baby boomers {{reaching}} retirement age has placed a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> housing services. The retirement village is increasingly {{accepted as a}} suitable living arrangement for older people. Ecological theory of ageing emphasizes a match between environment and older peoples’ competences. As one response to this, creating village environment in a sustainable way is on the agenda. However, it is not very clear what kinds of sustainable features should be incorporated within the village environment to fit residents’ competences, in particular given that baby boomers who have unique requirements have become the main potential customers. In present paper, a sustainable retirement village framework is proposed by building on ecological theory of ageing and triple bottom line. A two-step inductive reasoning research method is adopted in this conceptualization process. The proposed sustainable retirement village framework contains four domains, including senior-oriented basic settings, financial affordability, age-friendly social environment and environmental sustainability. These four domains are interrelated, and a sustainable retirement village stresses a dynamic balance between different domains. This proposed framework not only gives implications for village developers on creating a suitable village environment to better accommodate residents, but also paves the way {{for future studies on}} housing older people in an age-friendly manner...|$|R

500|$|The localizations for the Persona {{series are}} {{generally}} handled by translator Yu Namba of Atlus USA, who also handles localization for multiple other Megami Tensei games. Another prominent staff member was Nich Maragos, {{who worked with}} Namba on multiple Persona games until moving to Nintendo of America prior to 2015. The localization of Persona was handled by a small team, which put a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> them as they needed to adjust the game for Western audiences: the changes implemented included altering names, changing the appearance of characters, and removing numerous cultural references. An entire alternate main quest was also removed. After Persona, {{it was decided that}} future Persona games should be as faithful as possible to their original releases. Namba's first localization project for the series was Eternal Punishment. For the release of Innocent Sin, there was a debate over whether to release it, as it contained potentially controversial content including allusions to Nazism. In the end, due to staff and resource shortages, Innocent Sin was passed over for localization in favor of its sequel Eternal Punishment. Later, when the company developed the PSP ports, the team released the ports of Persona and Innocent Sin overseas so fans attracted by Persona 3 and 4 would be able to easily catch up {{with the rest of the}} series. The localization for Persona was completely redone, reverting and restoring all the previously altered or cut content. The port of Eternal Punishment was not localized due to [...] "unusual circumstances", so the company released the original version on PSN instead.|$|E
40|$|Student Experience Questionnaire {{data from}} 2009 {{highlighted}} that Health and Behavioural Sciences (HBS) students recognised the ‘good teaching’ {{that they received}} and the appropriate {{amount of time that}} they were given to understand the things they had to learn.

These results suggested that students were experiencing stressors that were encumbering their academic success that may not be related to pedagogy or content, but rather learning and teaching strategies, policies and curriculum. The researchers were also keen to investigate the impact of other home and work based responsibilities on success. This project aimed to identify the factors that hinder the success of HBS students and in doing so develop recommendations to address these threats. An individual facilitator conducted seven focus groups with students from the three schools (health sciences, psychology and nursing, midwifery and indigenous health) across a period of two weeks in November 2011. Focus group discussions were recorded using a digital recorder, transcribed verbatim and analysed.

While Hsu thought that this was the right choice to make, as it made the characters and dialogue more relatable and made for an emotional experience closer to what players of the Japanese version experience, it resulted in issues with each following game. According to the localization editor, Brandon Gay, Justice for All was one of their largest games to localize due to its focus on the story, and how it needs to convey the whole game world and its characters through just text; this made it a challenge to make the characters relatable for an American audience. Another thing the localization team had to keep in mind was to ensure that recurring characters were consistent with how they behave in the first Ace Attorney. According to JP Kellams, another staff member working on the localization, there was a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> them to make a good localization, as the first game's localization had been well received; he also felt that there was room for creativity due to the game's style and subject, with room for humor that might not fit in other localizations.

500|$|The show's {{directors}} {{were attached to}} locations instead of episodes and with several countries appearing in every episode, in reality none of them has a singular director. During the first season the Wachowskis were responsible for directorial duties in scenes shot in Chicago and San Francisco along with London and Iceland, two places which were initially announced to be helmed by Straczynski. Straczynski eventually opted to offer them to the siblings because of the extensive action scenes involved in those locations and instead focused his energy on post-production. James McTeigue (V for Vendetta, Ninja Assassin) worked on the Mexico City and Mumbai parts along with some in Reykjavík and German director Tom Tykwer (Cloud Atlas), whose Nairobi Half Life production impressed the Wachowskis, helmed Berlin and Nairobi. Dan Glass, {{who had been the}} visual effects supervisor for every Wachowski film since The Matrix Reloaded, reprised his role in Sense8 while also making his directorial debut in the Seoul part of the story. Even though there were times that units located in different countries were simultaneously shooting, the Wachowskis would travel to the various locations and have collaborations with the attached directors. Reportedly the Wachowskis directed such segments in locations where a different director was otherwise attached as the stunts the character of Silvestre performed for his action movie in Mexico City and in Nairobi car chase scenes with the [...] "Van Damn" [...] bus along with a fight scene involving machetes. In total, the Wachowskis were credited for directing seven episodes, McTeigue and Tykwer two each, and Glass one. During filming of the first season of Sense8 the Wachowskis were shooting ten to fifteen pages a day, which was much faster than the two to three pages a day pace they were used to on the typical large budget film. They commented it put a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> them, but Lilly also called it exciting learning how to adapt to it.

He later {{replaced}} the injured Pavel Bure of the Vancouver Canucks on the West's starting lineup. Kariya scored a goal and an assist for the Western Conference in a 5–4 loss to the Eastern Conference. Less than a month after the All-Star Game, the Mighty Ducks acquired Finnish winger Teemu Selänne in a trade with the Winnipeg Jets. Despite Kariya's efforts, the Ducks were low-scoring as a team; the deal was designed to give Kariya offensive support. Following the trade, Ducks centre Steve Rucchin commented, [...] "Paul had a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> him...He singlehandedly won some games for us this year...Now that we have Teemu, there's no way everybody can just key on Paul." [...] Selänne was immediately placed on Kariya's line; centred by Rucchin, the two wingers formed one of the League's most high-scoring duos for several seasons. In the last month of the 1995–96 campaign, Kariya achieved the 100-point single-season mark with a goal and three assists in a 5–3 win against the San Jose Sharks on April 7, 1996. A week later, he became the 14th-youngest NHL player to register 50 goals in one season, scoring twice in the final game of the campaign, a 5–2 win over Winnipeg. With seven goals and seven assists over the final seven games of the season, Kariya was named NHL Player of the Month for April. He finished the season with 50 goals and 58 assists for 108 points, tying him with Selänne for seventh overall in NHL scoring. His three overtime goals set a team record. With 20 penalty minutes over 82 games, Kariya won the Lady Byng Trophy as the League's most gentlemanly player and was also named to the season-ending NHL First All-Star Team. Following the addition of Selänne, the Mighty Ducks pushed for a playoff spot, winning 12 of their final 15 games, but finished the season ninth place in the West (the top eight teams qualify for the playoffs); they had an equal 78 points to the eighth-ranked Jets, but finished a spot below them by virtue of having fewer wins.|$|E
