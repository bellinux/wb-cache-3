50|$|Although {{the album}} hit #1 on the Australian and New Zealand charts {{it could not}} match the huge sales of band's {{previous}} release, True Colours.

In her recap, she points out: [...] "Need any more proof that Rumplestiltskin is Once Upon A Time’s best character? The episodes focused on him just seem to fly by.

Lowenthal was quoted as saying, [...] "I think, unfortunately, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> pandering to a bunch of commissions that have no understanding of what we do for a living, or the nature of our work, and to a workforce.

5000|$|Several {{have noted}} that the album is beautiful, noting the vocals of Annalisa Tornfelt from Bearfoot. Steve Leggett of Allmusic wrote that [...] "this fine second album shows the growth, poise, and vision of a {{completely}} separate band. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> due to the beautifully nuanced vocals of Annalisa Tornfelt, whose hushed, unhurried, and wonderfully balanced singing makes songs here like [...] "Rock of Ages" [...] and [...] "Nowhere, Massachusetts" [...] sound ageless, comforting, and wise." [...] Geoffrey Himes of The Washington Post described the album as [...] "impressive" [...] and that [...] "Tornfelt’s cool soprano and minimalist lyrics rein in the band’s wilder impulses and focus the sound on her tales of disappointed lovers, revivifying nature and the suicide of the Band’s Richard Manuel." ...|$|E
5000|$|Spence's {{campaign}} website {{asserted that}} he held a degree in economics, a statement also made {{on at least one}} campaign flier, which also incorrectly stated that he had gone to the university's business school. His degree is actually in home economics. After the inaccuracy was revealed and publicly criticized in January 2012, he corrected his website. Regarding the errors, Spence told the Associated Press [...] "I have said all along that I will not or do not lie ... A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> overblown, as I was not aware of any place that said business school ... I will take responsibility for this.

5000|$|His cire-perdue bronzes {{from this}} period are {{characterized}} by mythological themes, metamorphosis, death, the human condition and {{the mysteries of the}} cosmos. [...] "I've been asking myself insistently and for many years how it is to die. To leave one darkness in order to enter another semidarkness, the one that belongs to death. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> embodied in my sculptures and that's why this question upsets me profoundly. No one has ever seen this in my creations and it might not even be like this, but in this journey between the two darknesses I put all my effort". Often his figures are depicted with small heads, absent facial features, and gender ambiguities. The sensuality that characterized his earlier two-dimensional creations takes on new veneers in the textures and refined patinas of his bronzes, in which he also explores solidity and monumentality. Eduardo Serrano speaks of the creatures rendered in these bronzes as expectant and concerned for the future with “composed anxiety.” William Ospina in his literary and poetic essay, points the irony in Amaral's bronze sculptures from the 90s.|$|E

25|$|In September, the Clippers {{announced}} a radio broadcast deal with KSPN-AM, the local ESPN Radio-operated outlet. The team {{did not perform}} to expectations, compared to the previous season. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> had <b>been</b> attributed to lack of team chemistry and injuries to several key players, including Cassell, Thomas, Livingston, and Kaman. Players such as Luke Jackson, Alvin Williams, and Doug Christie were signed to 10-day contracts to help solidify the team's bench.|$|R
50|$|I've {{learned that}} a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{difficult}} for Europeans to understand. There are alternative communities in Europe which lessen the desperation we feel in America; the continent hasn't been swamped by the coprorate suburban gleichschaltung. Yet. What troubles me, however, as much as music becoming professionalized, is the tendency for alternative musical or political communities to close ranks and demand an ideological conformity of their members. Again, I can understand it: neo-feudal corporate capitalism works precisely by hijacking wishes and desires, hopes and ambitions, and slowly, benevolently, compromising them. Before he knows it, the idealist finds himself hopelessly enmeshed in the very lies and deceptions he formerly detested. Perhaps {{the only way you}} can avoid that fate is by becoming brutally, ruthlessly ideological. Trotsky criticized Lenin because he had no appreciation for art, but Lenin was a professional revolutionary, and saw all the art of his day as capitalist indoctrination. We are today witnessing, as a corollary to the professionalization of hardcore music, the professionalization of the alternative underground that gave birth to hardcore. It becomes insular and ideological, it makes hard and fast distinctions between those of the community and those outside it, it loses track of individual difference, and becomes unforgiving of the fundamental weaknesses found in human beings. In some ways, the underground is becoming as unfree as the mainstream it detests. And as a musician, I've been ripped off more by alternative people who claim they are my friends than by major label flunkes. They should know better.|$|E

30|$|Private {{preschool}} {{operators and}} teachers lamented {{that the long}} delay and complicated procedure in the application for registration of ECCE centers are the main reason of non registration (CDD, 2007 b). To register preschools, one needs to get approval from four different agencies which are the Fire Department, Social Welfare Department, Health and the Local Authority. Approval from some departments is slower than others due to under-staff, and perceived low priority. This {{is compounded by the}} fact that some private ECCE providers could not be bothered with laws and regulation and believe that the enforcement is so poor that they would not be affected. However a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> changing in the year 2007 where there are amendment of laws, provision of more man power and vigorous campaign to register ECCE providers. One stop centers are being formed too so that ECCE providers need only to go to one location to get everything approved. Perhaps given time, this issue of non-registration will be obsolete.|$|E

40|$|Energy {{subsidies}} are a controversial policy tool, and assessing them confronts {{an analyst with}} an even greater dilemma. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{due to the nature}} of subsidies: they are by default elusive as a concept, and invite starkly differing views on which benchmark price to assess them against. Subsidies can be implicit or off-budget, and as such raise doubts by some as to whether they should indeed be considered subsidies at all. Subsidies are also intended to fulfil very legitimate policy concerns such as welfare and development objectives, with diverging views on the effectiveness of subsidies in delivering on these policy goals. Finally, adverse experience with failed reform, and the political cost of popular protest against energy price rises renders the reform of energy subsidies in the eyes of many policymakers too costly. What is needed is a more constructive approach towards energy subsidies – with the acknowledgement that subsidies may achieve some of the intended objectives but also have important unintended consequences...|$|E
40|$|Economic {{stability}} {{can be seen}} as {{an essential}} component of any strategy for inclusive development. To the extent that central banks play a role in providing that stability, the experience of the crisis has led to considerable thinking and debate on its implications for central bank mandates, strategies and instruments in the quest for maintaining stability. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> being articulated by central bankers around the world, as they try and distill the lessons of the crisis into what they should be doing more or less of, or differently and how they should go about fulfilling possibly changed objectives.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{emphasis on}} quality {{and effectiveness of}} teaching {{in the past few}} years together with a climate of reduced resources, has heightened the need for innovation in academic life. In this edition five of the eight articles are reports by staff on their own teaching innovations. Penelope Watson reports on a student-centred learning project using selfmanaging teams in the Faculty of Law. The project was successfully trialed this year in the compulsory subject of Torts and met or exceeded the objectives in terms of student learning outcomes. Don Lewis reports on a project where materials previously developed for PAGE were used in on-campus teaching. Brian Martin reports on an activity in which he invited second year students to participate in a research project and coauthor publications. Fazel Naghdy deals with a different approach in his article on the use of problem based learning to meet the needs of a diverse group of students in advanced robotics. Parviz Doulai discusses his project which uses the World Wide Web and computer simulations. He mentions the development time required as well as the benefits to the effectiveness of teaching. Each of these reports contains ideas and approaches that may be adopted and adapted for other subjects or departments. The other three articles are included not only as provokers of thought but also as sources of practical assistance to staff. In their article John Goldring, Ainslie Lamb and Linda Tapsell describe a workshop on problem-based and experiential learning and remind the reader that although quite a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> already happening at Wollongong, many academic staff were not sure what it was all about. Robert Cannon (the only author not from Wollongong) suggests a new approach to time management that shifts the focus from time and things to relationships and results. The last paper, written by myself, proposes a model of teaching and learning activities which can be of practical assistance to staff in the reappraisal or development of subjects or in the conversion of subjects for flexible delivery. I hope you find this edition both enjoyable and helpful and I look forward to your comments and contributions...|$|E
