25|$|There are few <b>local</b> <b>tree</b> species {{suitable}} for planting in the desert, which are slow growing. Therefore, exotic tree species were introduced for plantation. Many species of Eucalyptus, Acacia, Cassia and other genera from Israel, Australia, US, Russia, Zimbabwe, Chile, Peru and Sudan {{have been tried}} in Thar Desert. Acacia tortilis {{has proved to be}} the most promising species for desert afforestation and the jojoba is another promising species of economic value found {{suitable for}} planting in these areas.|$|E

40|$|Genomes are now {{routinely}} being determing {{for large}} sets of individuals within a population and methods to analyze {{these have been}} investigated. Such analyzes can estimate the fundamental parameters of the population model describing the population or aloow ancestral analysis: statements about historical path of the genomes and genes, which can reveal events of interests such as migrations and selective sweeps. The ideal structure to describe the relationship among the genomes is the ancestral recombination graph (ARG) that was first described by Griffiths (1982) and Hudson (1983). However, for several reason making precise statements about the ARG is unrealistic. One reason is that all knowledge obtained from the genomes are at best the <b>local</b> <b>trees</b> for all genomic regions, but <b>local</b> <b>trees</b> don’t determine the ARG. A second reason is that obtaining the <b>local</b> <b>trees</b> is computationally very demanding. Thus investing approximate but fast methods to <b>local</b> <b>trees</b> are of great interest. One first natural approximation is to discretize the continuous time in the <b>local</b> <b>trees.</b> This has been explored in the so-called coaHMMs (). Even if only the topologies of were registered for the <b>local</b> <b>trees,</b> {{there is a very}} large number of these. However, it is expected from coalescent theory that these tree topologies contains sub-trees with very short branches that rarely changes as we move along the genomes and what really is of interest is th...|$|R

25|$|Several {{other reasons}} may cause the {{environment}} to be too extreme for trees to grow. This can include geothermal exposure associated with hot springs or volcanoes, such as at Yellowstone; high soil acidity near bogs; high salinity associated with playas or salt lakes; or ground that is saturated with groundwater that excludes oxygen from the soil, which most tree roots need for growth. The margins of muskegs and bogs are common examples {{of these types of}} open area. However, no such line exists for swamps, where trees, such as Bald cypress and the many mangrove species, have adapted to growing in permanently waterlogged soil. In some colder parts of the world there are tree lines around swamps, where there are no <b>local</b> <b>tree</b> species that can develop. There are also man-made pollution tree lines in weather-exposed areas, where new tree lines have developed because of the increased stress of pollution. Examples are found around Nikel in Russia and previously in the Erzgebirge.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-2000s, {{several of}} the {{developers}} of BCG, including Charles Fillmore, Paul Kay, Ivan Sag and Laura Michaelis, collaborated {{in an effort to}} improve the formal rigor of BCG and clarify its representational conventions. The result was Sign Based Construction Grammar (SBCG). SBCG is based on a multiple-inheritance hierarchy of typed feature structures. The most important type of feature structure in SBCG is the sign, with subtypes word, lexeme and phrase. The inclusion of phrase within the canon of signs marks a major departure from traditional syntactic thinking. In SBCG, phrasal signs are licensed by correspondence to the mother of some licit construct of the grammar. A construct is a <b>local</b> <b>tree</b> with signs at its nodes. Combinatorial constructions define classes of constructs. Lexical class constructions describe combinatoric and other properties common to a group of lexemes. Combinatorial constructions include both inflectional and derivational constructions. SBCG is both formal and generative; while cognitive-functional grammarians have often opposed their standards and practices to those of formal, generative grammarians, there is in fact no incompatibility between a formal, generative approach and a rich, broad-coverage, functionally based grammar. It simply happens that many formal, generative theories are descriptively inadequate grammars. SBCG is generative in a way that prevailing syntax-centered theories are not: its mechanisms are intended to represent all of the patterns of a given language, including idiomatic ones; there is no 'core' grammar in SBCG. SBCG a licensing-based theory, as opposed to one that freely generates syntactic combinations and uses general principles to bar illicit ones: a word, lexeme or phrase is well formed if and only if it is described by a lexeme or construction. Recent SBCG works have expanded on the lexicalist model of idiomatically combining expressions sketched out in Sag 2012.|$|E

2500|$|Feathers {{from local}} and faraway sources were used, {{especially}} in the Aztec Empire. The feathers were obtained from wild birds {{as well as from}} domesticated turkeys and ducks, with the finest feathers coming from Chiapas, Guatemala and Honduras [...] These feathers were obtained through trade and tribute. Feathers functioned as a kind of currency along with cocoa beans, and were a popular trade item because of their value and ease of transport over long distances and a close relationship developed between traders and feather workers. Certain areas were required to pay tribute in raw feathers and other in finished feather goods, but no area was required to provide both. Cuetzalan paid tribute to Moctezuma in the form of quetzal feathers. This demand was so great that it led to the local extinction of quetzals in that region, leaving only the name of a <b>local</b> <b>tree,</b> quetzalcuahuitl, where the birds used to hide to eat.|$|E
