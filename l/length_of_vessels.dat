40|$|Background: Angiogenesis, is an {{important}} process in physiological and pathological conditions as tumor growth and metastasis. Therefore, combinations that lead to inhibit angiogenesis may develop as an anti-cancer drug. In the present research, the anti-angiogenesis effect of Licorice root extract and Glycyrrhizic acid in Chorioallantoic membrane is investigated. Methods: In this experimental study, 45 ROSS fertilized eggs were randomly divided into three groups, Control, experimental 1 and 2. On the eighth day, Chorioallantoic membrane was soaked in control group with DMSO, in the first experimental group with extract of licorice and in the second, with Glycyrrhizic acid. Twelfth day photographed from samples whit using of photosteriomicroscope, the number, and <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> measured, also Drabkin test was performed to estimate the vessel density. Obtained data were analyzed by t-test (P< 0. 05). Results: The mean number and <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> in samples treated with extract was showed a significant decrease compared to the control (P < 0. 001). The mean number and <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> in samples treated with Glycyrrhizic acid was showed a significant reduction compared to the control (P < 0. 05).

Conclusion: Both of, licorice extract and Glycyrrhizic acid have inhibitory effect on angiogenesis in Chick chorioallantoic membrane; however, the inhibitory effect of extract is stronger than Glycyrrhizic acid. Therefore licorice and Glycyrrhizic acid can be as suitable candidate on angiogenesis study. ...|$|E

Stachys Lavandulifolia of Laminacea family prossesses antioxidant and anti-apoptosis effects. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of Stachys Lavandulifolia alcoholic extract on angiogenesis in chorioallantoic membrane of Ross chicken embryo. Methods: In this experimental study, 30 Ross fertilized eggs were divided into 5 random groups consisting of: control, sham-exposed, treatment with 25, 50, 100 mg/kg doses of alcoholic extract. On the 2 nd day of incubation, windows were opened for eggs under the sterile conditions. On the 8 th day, a gelatine sponge with 1 × 4 × 4 diameter (Albumen and Agar solution in normal saline) was placed on chorioalantoic membrane (CAM) to which extract was added.

This study was conducted to investigate the synergic effect of glycyrrhizic acid and electromagnetic field on angiogenesis. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 44 Ross fertilized chicken eggs were randomly divided into four groups, one control and three experimental. Control group was kept with dimethyl sulfoxide on the eighth day, experimental group 1 treated with 200 gauss, 50 Hz electromagnetic field on the 10 th day, experimental group 2 treated with 1 mg/ml glycyrrhizic acid on the eighth day, and experimental group 3 simultaneously treated with glycyrrhizic acid on the eighth day and electromagnetic field on the 10 th day. On the 12 th day, the images of chorioallantoic membrane samples were prepared using photostreomicroscope and the number and <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> were measured. Results: The mean number of vessels in the experimental groups 1 and 3 (29. 31 +/- 3. 60 and 27. 43 +/- 4. 61, respectively) was not significantly different from that in the control group (29. 11 +/- 4. 76) (p> 0. 05).

Methods: In this experimental study, 70 Ross fertilized eggs were randomly divided into: control, sham and five experimental groups. On the 8 th day of incubation, experimental groups were treated with 0. 5 - 5 mM of eugenol. On the 12 th day, all cases were photographed and the numbers and lengths of vessels around the sponges were measured via applying image J software. Furthermore, the hemoglobin content was measured using Drabkin test, and then the embryo weight was recorded. The study data were analyzed statistically via SPSS software utilizing ANOVA test at significance level of p< 0. 05. Results: No significant difference was observed in regard with average number and <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> in sham and control groups.

Nevertheless, direct measurements of individual vessel segments have been limited because existing techniques for measuring vasculature are invasive, time consuming, and technically difficult. We developed software that extracts the length, radius, and connectivity of in vivo vessels from contrast-enhanced 3 D Magnetic Resonance Angiography.

Results: The estimation of vascular length at US examination correlated highly with the measured vascular length (r = 0. 92; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 87 to 0. 94), as did the length estimated from the films (r = 0. 94; 95 % CI 0. 9 to 0. 96). The correlation between examiners was 0. 84 (95 % CI 0. 51 to 0. 94) for the estimates made during US examination and 0. 85 (95 % CI 0. 59 to 0. 95) for the vessel lengths measured from the digital images. Conclusions: These excellent correlations indicate that tendon vascularity can be reliably estimated using colour Doppler ultrasonography and tendon vascularity could therefore be used by clinicians to rate clinical change. This method of quantifying tendon vascularity could also be used in research to investigate the effects of tendon treatments on vascularity. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Background—Restenosis and {{consequent}} adverse cardiac events are increased in diabetics undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Use of intracoronary stents may ameliorate such risks; however, factors influencing {{the likelihood of}} restenosis after stent deployment in this high-risk patient subgroup are unknown. Methods and Results—We retrospectively analyzed all stented diabetic patients in 16 studies of percutaneous coronary intervention, all of which underwent core angiographic analysis at Cardialysis, Rotterdam. Univariate and multivariate analyses, with 37 clinical and angiographic variables, compared those with and without restenosis and predicted restenosis rates calculated {{through the use of}} reference charts derived from angiographic data. Within the studies, 418 of 3090 (14 %) stented patients with 6 -month angiographic follow-up had diabetes. Restenosis (50 % diameter stenosis at follow-up) occurred in 550 of 2672 (20. 6 %) nondiabetic and 130 of 418 (31. 1 %) diabetic patients (P 0. 001). Univariate predictors of restenosis in diabetics were smaller vessel reference diameter (RD) (P 0. 001), smaller minimal luminal diameter before stenting (P 0. 01), smaller minimal luminal diameter and percent diameter stenosis after stenting (P 0. 001, P 0. 04), greater stented <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> (P 0. 001), and reduced body mass index (BMI) (P 0. 04). With the use of multivariate analysis, only smaller RD (P 0. 003), greater stented <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> (P 0. 04), and reduced BMI (P 0. 04) were associated with restenosis. Reference charts demonstrated an incremental risk of restenosis that appears solely dependent on vessel RD...|$|R
