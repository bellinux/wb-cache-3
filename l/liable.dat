5|$|On June 10, 1940, the 17-year-old Hatfield, {{driving his}} mother's car, struck {{and killed a}} pedestrian, Alice Marie Lane, as she crossed the street. Hatfield was not held criminally <b>liable</b> for the crash, but was found civilly <b>liable</b> to the family. The case {{made its way to}} the Oregon Supreme Court in 1943, with the court affirming the trial court's decision.|$|E
5|$|Statutory utility {{providers}} are never <b>liable</b> for damages caused by their negligence.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a general}} rule that a {{landlord}} who leases a property is not <b>liable</b> for nuisances created after the occupier takes control of the land. There is an exception where the lease is granted for a purpose which constitutes a nuisance, as in Tetley v Chitty, or where the nuisance is caused by their failure to repair the premises, as in Wringe v Cohen. The landlord is also <b>liable</b> were the nuisance existed before the land was let, and he knew or ought to have known about it. Under the principle of vicarious liability, an occupier of land can also be <b>liable</b> {{for the actions of}} their employees; in Matania v National Provincial Bank, it was also established that they could be <b>liable</b> for the activities of independent contractors under certain circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Bars and {{restaurants}} are considered strictly <b>liable</b> for their patrons' behavior, and liquor licenses can be suspended or revoked if a customer engages in illegal activity (e.g. fighting, public urination) after drinking. New Jersey law recognizes both dram shop liability and social host liability, wherein the server of alcohol to visibly intoxicated persons or minors is <b>liable</b> {{if that person}} then causes death or injury to a third party in an alcohol-related automobile collision or other accident. In order to mitigate liability, the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) grants licensed establishments the right to exclude any patron for any reason, but warns business against violating civil rights laws.|$|E
5|$|In October 2014, a New York judge found Trump {{personally}} <b>liable</b> {{for operating}} the company without the required business license.|$|E
5|$|It is the employer's {{responsibility}} to withhold, remit, and file the OPT returns. If an employer does not comply, the employer {{can be held}} <b>liable</b> for both portions of the OPT as well as penalties and interest.|$|E
5|$|On June 8, 2005, a Florida {{state court}} jury in Orlando found that Learjet was not <b>liable</b> {{for the deaths}} of Stewart and his agents Robert Fraley and Van Ardan, who had also been aboard the plane.|$|E
5|$|The {{defendants}} {{were subject to}} fines of up to $100,000 per violation of the Spyware Act and $2,000 per violation of the Consumer Protection Act if found <b>liable.</b> They were also subject to paying restitution to affected consumers.|$|E
5|$|These {{changes were}} {{embodied}} in the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907, which passed the Commons with little opposition save for a dispute over the future status of Militia regiments. It essentially abolished the existing Volunteers and Yeomanry, and used them {{to create a new}} Territorial Force of fourteen infantry divisions, fourteen cavalry brigades, and a large number of support units, all raised, organised and financed by local organisations but <b>liable</b> for service under War Office command. The Militia provided the Special Reserve, which would contain men who had not served in the regular Army but agreed to be <b>liable</b> for service with the regular forces in wartime.|$|E
5|$|While {{the courts}} in New Jersey allow actions based on dram shop {{liability}} or social host liability, they will instruct a jury to consider the intoxicated person's negligence under the doctrine of comparative negligence. Licensed establishments and social hosts may be <b>liable</b> for drunk driving accidents, assaults, falls, and other injuries and property damage caused by a customer, but are not <b>liable</b> for behavior which is unforeseeable (e.g. falling out of a tree), nor are they <b>liable</b> if they only served food or non-alcoholic beverages to a drunk patron. Dram shop and social host litigation may involve both compensatory and punitive damages. There is a 2-year statute of limitations for such lawsuits, but the time limit may be extended if the victim is a juvenile.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a verdict}} {{delivered}} by the Municipal Court in Prague on March 5, 2013, it was proven that Blythe had thrown Nosek offstage and thus had moral responsibility for his death. However, due to the circumstances, Blythe was not held criminally <b>liable,</b> {{and most of the}} blame lay with promoters and security members. The acquittal was upheld by the Prague High Court on June 5, 2013.|$|E
5|$|An initial trial {{concluded}} on 23 May 2008 when Mr Justice David Steel {{issued a}} summary judgment after hearing that both Total and Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd (HOSL) had agreed that negligence was the cause. In the main trial, Total UK {{claimed that the}} duty supervisor {{at the time was}} responsible for the explosion, but refused to admit either civil or criminal liability for the incident. Total UK argued that it should not be <b>liable</b> for damages because it could not reasonably have foreseen that it would cause the destruction it did. On 20 March 2009 the High Court found Total <b>liable</b> for the blast, saying that it was satisfied that Total had control of tank filling operations at the Buncefield depot. The judgement left the company facing damage claims of around Â£700million.|$|E
5|$|By Justinian's time, {{the scheme}} was simpler: instead of {{complementing}} actions for manifest and non-manifest theft, handling stolen goods, or concealing them made one instead <b>liable</b> for non-manifest theft, whose two-times penalty was maintained. Searches {{were carried out}} by public authorities, and the wide definition of theft covered a bad faith receiver of goods.|$|E
5|$|During the 1895 South Carolina state {{constitutional}} convention, however, Tillman supported {{a provision that}} permitted the removal from office of sheriffs who through negligence or connivance permitted a lynching. He also supported a provision that held the county where the lynching occurred <b>liable</b> for damages of $2,000 or more {{to be paid to}} the heirs of the victim.|$|E
5|$|False {{statements}}. Offenders {{who make}} or publish false statements of fact regarding the personal character or conduct of a candidate, or false statements about a candidate's {{withdrawal from the}} election, are <b>liable</b> on conviction to a fine or jail of up to 12 months or both, and to the disqualifications referred to above.|$|E
5|$|If any {{employee}} performs work in {{the city}} limits and is paid over $500 for that work in a single month, the employee and employer are both <b>liable</b> for the OPT regardless of where the main business office is located or headquartered.|$|E
5|$|In July 2008, United States District Judge Karl Forester ruled Delta {{will not}} be held <b>liable</b> for the crash, because while Comair is a wholly owned {{subsidiary}} of the Atlanta-based airline, Comair maintains its own management and policies, and employs its own pilots.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, the Court {{began to}} read the Fifteenth Amendment more broadly. In Guinn v. United States (1915), a {{unanimous}} Court struck down an Oklahoma grandfather clause that effectively exempted white voters from a literacy test, finding it to be discriminatory. The Court ruled in the related case Myers v. Anderson (1915), that the officials who enforced such a clause were <b>liable</b> for civil damages.|$|E
5|$|Involuntary {{manslaughter}} {{involves the}} causing {{of the death}} of another person without intent to kill or intention to commit grievous bodily harm. Some cases are in form similar to murder cases; whilst, in others, had death not been caused, the defendant would only be <b>liable</b> for an insignificant crime.|$|E
5|$|On March 5, 2013, {{the court}} {{delivered}} a verdict, {{according to which}} Blythe was not criminally <b>liable</b> for Nosek's death, {{even though he had}} the moral responsibility for it. Consequently, the court dismissed the damages claim and ordered the return of Blythe's bail.|$|E
5|$|Somerset {{is largely}} rural {{and the two}} main centres of population, Bath and Weston-super-Mare, were {{transferred}} to the unitary authority districts of Bath and North East Somerset and North Somerset respectively, in 1996 but are still part of the ceremonial county. The Somerset Levels are <b>liable</b> to flooding and the only significant towns are Glastonbury and Street which occupy slightly elevated locations on the Polden Hills.|$|E
5|$|Swedish {{is one of}} the {{official}} languages of the European Union and one of the working languages of the Nordic Council. Under the Nordic Language Convention, citizens of the Nordic countries speaking Swedish have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being <b>liable</b> to any interpretation or translation costs.|$|E
5|$|The ILO {{successfully}} {{restricted the}} addition of lead to paint, and convinced several countries to adopt an eight-hour work day and forty-eight-hour working week. It also campaigned to end child labour, increase {{the rights of women}} in the workplace, and make shipowners <b>liable</b> for accidents involving seamen. After the demise of the League, the ILO became an agency of the United Nations in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The {{volatile}} oil, oleum cubebae, was {{the form}} in which cubeb is most commonly used as a drug, the dose being 5 to 20 minims, which may be suspended in mucilage or given after meals in a wafer. The drug exhibited the typical actions of a volatile oil, but exerted some of these to an exceptional degree. As such, it was <b>liable</b> to cause a cutaneous erythema {{in the course of}} its excretion by the skin, had a marked diuretic action, and was a fairly efficient disinfectant of the urinary passages. Its administration caused the appearance in the urine of a salt of cubebic acid which was precipitated by heat or nitric acid, and was therefore <b>liable</b> to be mistaken for albumin, when these two most common tests for the occurrence of albuminuria were applied.|$|E
5|$|There {{is every}} reason to believe that a very close {{formation}} of six Wellington aircraft will emerge from a long and heavy attack by enemy fighters with very few if any casualties to its own aircraft. A loose formation is however <b>liable</b> to suffer very heavy casualties under the same conditions.|$|E
5|$|A {{contravention}} of {{the regulations}} renders speakers and organizers of demonstrations <b>liable</b> to fines of up to $10,000, or incarceration of up to six months. The penalty for displaying anything violent, lewd or obscene at a demonstration is a fine not exceeding $3,000 or, on a subsequent conviction, $5,000. Events which adhere to the regulations are also not immune from other existing laws such as those relating to defamation and sedition.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a decree}} from 1972, the Ministry of Justice {{prepared}} proposals for the codification of law; it carried out methodological management of legal {{work in the}} national economy. The Ministry directed and coordinated the work of state bodies and public organisations to promote legal knowledge and to clarify the law among the population about the judicial agencies, as well as general management of the civil registry, state, and legal profession. The Ministry was <b>liable</b> to the Party, the state, and the people. The Ministry's main goal was to strengthen socialist legality {{and the rule of}} law within Soviet judicial institutions.|$|E
5|$|American Continental went {{bankrupt}} in April 1989, and Lincoln {{was seized by}} the FHLBB on April 14, 1989. About 23,000 customers were left with worthless bonds. Many investors, often ones living in California retirement communities, lost their life savings, and felt emotional damage for having been duped {{on top of their}} financial devastation. The total bondholder loss came to between $250 million and $288 million. The federal government was eventually <b>liable</b> for $3.4 billion to cover Lincoln's losses when it seized the institution.|$|E
5|$|By 1944, the SS-TV {{had been}} {{organized}} into three divisions: {{staff of the}} concentration camps in Germany and Austria, in the occupied territories, and of the extermination camps in Poland. By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members {{in and out of}} the camps, partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members. This rotation of personnel meant that nearly the entire SS knew what was going on inside the concentration camps, making the entire organization <b>liable</b> for war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th century Conisbrough Castle {{was in a}} poor {{state of}} repair, and a royal survey carried out in 1537 and 1538 showed that the gates, bridge {{and parts of the}} walls had {{collapsed}} in a spectacular land slippage, and that one floor of the keep had also fallen in. The collapse of the walls was a consequence of the instability of the topsoil on top of the limestone spur, which was a mixture of clay and sandstone; once the clay was washed away over time, the remaining sandstone proved extremely unstable and <b>liable</b> to crack.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian's edicts {{emphasized}} the common liability of all taxpayers. Public records of all taxes were made public. The position of decurion, {{member of the}} city council, had been an honor sought by wealthy aristocrats and the middle classes who displayed their wealth by paying for city amenities and public works. Decurions were made <b>liable</b> for any shortfall {{in the amount of}} tax collected. Many tried to find ways to escape the obligation.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that barotrauma is causing bat fatalities around wind turbines. Bats have typical mammalian lungs, which {{are thought to}} be more sensitive to sudden air pressure changes than the lungs of birds, making them more <b>liable</b> to fatal rupture. In addition, {{it has been suggested that}} bats are attracted to these structures, perhaps seeking roosts, and thereby increasing the death rate. Acoustic deterrents may help to reduce bat mortality at wind farms.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, a town {{planning}} {{report for the}} City of Perth noted traffic congestion on Albany Road in Victoria Park. As widening the existing road would have left the council <b>liable</b> for compensation from affected businesses and properties, the provision of bypass routes was recommended instead. To provide the bypasses, parallel roads would be upgraded and extended: Berwick Street to the south-west, and Shepparton Road to the north-east.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Sibley's parent, May Co., merged {{operations}} with Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based Kaufmann's. That same year, local chain AM's (Adam, Meldrum & Anderson Company) {{moved from the}} nearby Thruway Mall into the space originally planned for B. Altman. The owner of the Thruway Mall sued the AM's chain, claiming breach of contract; the chain would later be declared <b>liable</b> for damages to the Thruway Mall, which was subsequently torn down and rebuilt as a strip mall in the early 1990s. Finally, Hoyts sold the Walden Galleria theater complex to General Cinemas {{by the end of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|In September 1899, it {{was clear}} that the crisis in South Africa was likely to turn into war. By 2 October, all {{military}} leave had been cancelled, and urgent preparations were under way to send a large expeditionary force to the Cape, with horses and supplies being requisitioned and mobilised. On 7 October, a proclamation was issued calling out the Army Reserve. Of 65,000 <b>liable</b> men, around 25,000 were intended to be called up for service. The Second Boer War broke out on 11 October.|$|E
