40|$|Design {{optimization}} of seat cushions {{is associated}} with the need to investigate their softness using, for this purpose, various kinds of loading pads. The aim of the investigation was: to determine seat cushion stiffness of a chair selected from a set of dining-room furniture, to determine values and distributions of contact strains on the seat surface caused by <b>loading</b> <b>pad</b> of different hardness, numerical calculation of contact strains between the seat cushion and the <b>loading</b> <b>pad</b> and to verify the results of these calculations with the results of laboratory experiments. The performed tests showed that the assessment of the seat cushion stiffness and the evaluation of contact stresses on their surface should be carried out using an equally stiff <b>loading</b> <b>pad.</b> In numerical calculations, polyurethane foams should be modeled as hyperfoam bodies of σ=f(ε) characteristics determined in an axial compression test. Contact stresses between the seat cushion and the user’s body should be reduced as a result of application of a frictionless connection of thin layers of polyurethane foams with foam forming the proper elastic layer of the seat...|$|E

Sixteen microfluidic CSs, each containing a <b>loading</b> <b>pad,</b> a microchannel, and a capillary pump are engraved in a single PDMS chip. The CSs are used for two applications, firstly to pattern fibronectin on glass surfaces to locally control the adhesion of cultured cells to the substrate, and secondly to carry out multiplexed miniaturized immunoassays. Key words: Microfluidics, Miniaturizated immunoassays, Micromosaic immunoassays, Protein patterning Microfluidic systems can transport minute amounts on solutions and replace macroscopic tubes, pipettes, vessels, and dishes in a myriad of applications. They help save reagents by reducing sample size from milliliters to microliters, decrease the time to result by enhancing mass transport, and allow many reactions {{to be carried out}} simultaneously on a small chip. These characteristics have driven the adoption of microfluidic systems in many different fields and notably in chemistry, biology, and medicine.

At a minimum, bus stops must have firm, stable, slip-resistant <b>loading</b> <b>pads</b> with connected sidewalks and curb ramps. Consequently, the typical approach of transit agencies has been to install permanent concrete <b>loading</b> <b>pads</b> at bus stops. This study explored alternatives to conventional concrete pads with movable pads that could be installed quickly, resulting in savings in construction and labor costs and minimizing both disruptions to traffic and impacts to abutting businesses. Potential design alternatives in terms of materials and structural support for these pads were evaluated. The review focused on existing and alternative design materials, especially in applications other than for transit purposes. Six materials were evaluated based on their structural performance, long-term durability, adaptability, life cycle cost, aesthetics, and safety and accessibility of transit riders with mobility devices.

40|$|The Falling weight {{deflectometer}} test (FWD) is {{a commonly}} used method {{for the evaluation}} of the structural performance of pavement systems. In the FWD test, a large weight is raised off the ground and dropped onto a rubber <b>loading</b> <b>pad</b> creating an impulse load representative of the real loading imposed by heavy traffic on the pavement. The excitation produced by the loading sets off waves in the pavement and underlying soil. Deflection time histories are gathered by an array of sensors placed at several nearby locations. The traditional method for interpreting the FWD data to backcalculate structural pavement properties, involves extracting the peak deflection from each displacement trace of the sensors (deflection basin) and matching it through an iterative optimization method to the deflections predicted by a static model of the pavement. This approach is computationally efficient, and when the depths of the layers are known, and their properties are largely homogeneous with depth, the procedure is effective in backcalculating layer properties. However, when the depths are uncertain or when the moduli vary within a layer, the static backcalculation scheme may not yield reliable results.

40|$|Kaposi's sarcoma-associated {{herpesvirus}} (also named human herpesvirus 8) is a γ-herpesvirus that undergoes both lytic and latent infection. During latent infection, two viral {{elements are}} required: latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA), which functions as an origin binding protein, and the latent origin, which resides within the terminal repeats (TRs) of the viral genome. Previously, we identified two cis-elements within the TRs which {{are required for}} latent DNA replication: two LANA binding sites (LBS 1 and LBS 2 [LBS 1 / 2]) and a GC-rich replication element (RE) upstream of LBS 1 / 2. To further characterize the RE, we constructed a 71 -bp minimal replicon (MR) and performed a detailed mutational analysis. Our data indicate that the first 8 nucleotides within the RE are critical for replication. Moreover, both the position and {{the distance between the}} RE and LBS 1 / 2 can affect origin replication activity, suggesting that the RE may function as a <b>loading</b> <b>pad</b> for cellular proteins involved in replication. Using biotinylated DNA fragments of wild-type or mutant MRs as probes, we identified 30 proteins that preferentially bind to the origin. Among these proteins, structure-specific recognition protein 1 (SSRP 1), a subunit of the FACT complex, and telomeric repeat binding factor 2 (TRF 2) formed complexes with LANA at the MR region. Furthermore, the small interfering RNA-based knockdown of SSRP 1, but not the dominant-negative-based knockdown of TRF 2, significantly decreased the efficiency of LANA-dependent DNA replication. These results indicate that SSRP 1 is a novel cellular protein involved in LANA-dependent DNA replication...|$|E

All of the deep beams had a centre-to-centre spacing of 2000 mm between the two supports, 1000 mm in height, and 350 mm in thickness. They were simply supported with an application of a single point load at midspan. The total length of the four beams varies {{depending on the type of}} anchorage being used. The four anchorage details that were considered in this study include a straight development length, a standard 90 degree hook, friction-welded 1. 5 in. (38 mm) diameter circular headed bars and friction-welded 2 in. (50 mm) diameter headed bars. The dimensions of the <b>loading</b> <b>pad</b> and the bearing pads were 200 mm (and 300 mm) and 100 mm, respectively.

El-Jorf (2006) carried out the testing and analysis of the other four full-scale deep beams in this overall research program. This research project demonstrated that providing friction-welded circular headed bars capable of developing the full yield strength at the head results in shorter beams and improved response compared to straight bar embedment details. Providing a lead-in length as well as friction-welded circular headed bars, with reduced head size, provides improved ductility compared to the straight bar embedment and compared to the hooked anchorage.

40|$|Test {{results that}} examine the {{influence}} of jacking-oil ports on a tilting pad journal (TPJ) bearing are presented. The static and dynamic characteristics before and after adding jacking-oil ports are compared. The test bearing is a four-pad, rocker-pivot, 57 % pivot offset TPJ bearing in <b>load</b> between <b>pad</b> configuration. This original bearing was modified to include jacking-oil ports on the two <b>loaded</b> <b>pads</b> and retested at the same operating conditions. The ports occupy 5 % of the pad?s surface area and have an approximate depth of 25 times the radial clearance. Pressurized jacking-oil was not used during testing; however, oil supply lines complete with check valves were added to emulate a typical industrial bearing assembly. This thesis compares both the static and dynamic bearing characteristics {{to determine the effects}} jacking-oil ports had. Rotordynamic coefficients are presented as dimensionless values, using a frequency-independent [K][C][M] model. The added jacking-oil ports caused a decrease in direct damping and increase in virtual-mass. Direct damping coefficients were reduced by an average of - 26 % in the loaded y-direction, and - 9 % in the orthogonal x-direction. The original bearing had all negative direct virtual-mass coefficients (stiffening with increasing frequency). The modified bearing had negative coefficients that were smaller in magnitude, and some virtual-mass coefficients that were positive. No significant changes were observed in any of the cross-coupled coefficients or the direct stiffness coefficients. The added jacking-oil ports has no significant impact on the static characteristics of the TPJ bearing. Static characteristics included the steady-state journal eccentricity, attitude angle, minimum film-thickens, and pad temperature. A predictive bearing code was modified to account for the jacking-oil port geometry but was unable to produce predictions matching the measured change in dynamic performance. Contrary to measurements, the code predicted frequency-dependent direct rotordynamic coefficients and no reduction in direct stiffness or damping for the bearing with jacking-oil ports. The influence of jacking-oil ports on a simple rotor-bearing system is presented. Rotordynamic predictions were made for a rigid rotor symmetrically supported by two TPJ bearings. Predictions showed that jacking-oil ports can significantly lower the first critical speed. This was attributed to the change in virtual-mass coefficients. There was only a small reduction in damping ratio predicted...|$|R
40|$|Static, dynamic, {{and thermal}} {{characteristics}} (measured and predicted) are presented for a 4 -pad, spherical-seat, TPJB with 0. 5 pivot offset, 0. 6 L/D, 101. 6 mm nominal diameter, and 0. 3 preload in the LBP orientation. One bearing is tested four separate {{times in the}} following four different lubrication configurations: (1) flooded single-orifice (SO) at the bearing shell, (2) evacuated leading edge groove (LEG), (3) evacuated spray-bar blocker (SBB), and (4) evacuated spray-bar (SB). The LEG, SBB, and SB are all considered methods of ?directed lubrication?. These methods rely on lubrication injected directly to the pad/rotor interface. The same set of pads is used for every test to maintain clearance and preload; each method of lubrication is added as an assembly to the bearing. Test conditions include surface speeds and unit loads up to 85 m/s and 2. 9 MPa respectively. Static data includes measured bearing clearances prior to operation (cold) and immediately after operation (hot), rotor-bearing eccentricities and attitude angles, and {{a new approach to}} locating the hot center of a bearing. Dynamic data includes: (1) impedance values calculated from measured accelerations, displacements, and excitation forces; and (2) four sets (one set for each bearing configuration) of direct and cross-coupled rotordynamic coefficients derived from measurements and fit to a frequency independent KCM model. Thermal data include measured temperatures from sixteen bearing thermocouples along with inlet, outlet, stator housing, and ambient thermocouples. Twelve of the bearing thermocouples are embedded in the babbitt layer of the pads while the remaining four are oriented at the leading and trailing edge of the <b>loaded</b> <b>pads</b> exposed to the lubricant. Bearing thermocouples provide a circumferential and axial temperature gradient. The pivot stiffness (pad and pivot in series) is measured and incorporated into predictions. Measured static, dynamic, and thermal values are compared to predictions from XL_TPJB, a computer code developed at the Texas A&M University Turbomachinery Lab for predicting bearing performance. Measurements show significant cross-coupled stiffness terms with opposite signs and magnitudes that are 20 - 50 % of the direct terms, a max axial temperature gradient of 9. 6 ?C, and attitude angles as high as 29 ?; all of these indicate that the tilt motion of the pad may be impeded by friction between the spherical pivot and the pad. Temperature measurements show directed lubrication, coupled with an evacuated bearing housing, reduces max bearing temperatures up to 13. 9 ?C for the LEG, 10. 2 ?C for the SBB, and 12. 8 ?C for the SB. Although the SB and SBB reduce the max bearing temperature as intended, they can also cause an increase in temperatures at the leading and trailing edges of the <b>loaded</b> <b>pads.</b> The LEG typically reduced temperatures at all locations. Compared to the base case of the flooded SO, directed lubrication reduces the max bearing temperature. Additionally, the dynamics of the system can also be significantly impacted. Using directed lubrication can reduce direct stiffness by up to 18 % for the LEG, 25 % for the SBB, and 20 % for the SB. Similarly, the direct damping can be reduced by up to 24 % for the LEG, 45 % for the SBB, and 34 % for the SB...|$|R
40|$|Tilting pad journal {{bearings}} (TPJBs) supporting rotors for high performance turbomachinery have undergone steady design improvements to satisfy more stringent operating conditions that include large specific loads due to smaller footprints, and high surface speeds that produce larger drag power losses and lubricant temperature rise. Simultaneously, predictive models continuously evolve to include minute details on bearing geometry, pads and pivots? configurations, oil delivery systems, etc. This thesis introduces a fluid film flow model including both pad and pivot flexibility {{to predict the}} static and dynamic force performance of typical TPJBs. This performance encompasses journal eccentricity, drag power loss, lubricant temperature rise, fluid film thickness, fluid film pressure, bearing complex stiffnesses, static stiffnesses, damping coefficients and virtual mass coefficients. A finite element (FE) pad structural model (with/without the Babbitt layer) is coupled to a thin film flow model to determine the mechanical deformation of the pad upper surface. Recently, Gaines and Childs conducted experiments with three TPJB sets, each having three pads, over a range of load and rotational speed conditions. To quantify the effect of pad flexibility on the bearings? dynamic performance, the pad thickness varies from thin to thick, t= 8. 5 mm, 10 mm and 11. 5 mm. The test data shows that pad flexibility reduces the journal eccentricity and the dynamic force coefficients. The current model with both pad and pivot flexibility delivers predictions correlating favorably with the test data, in particular the bearing stiffnesses, yet it overestimates the bearing damping coefficients. Predictions for bearing models available in the archival literature show that the maximum pad surface deformation occurs on the <b>loaded</b> <b>pad</b> at both its leading and trailing edges; i. e. under mechanical pressure a pad opens. The deformation at the pad mid-plane (Z= 0) is slightly larger than that at the pad side edges (Z=? 1 / 2 L). Contrary {{to the effect of}} pivot flexibility that leads to an increase in journal eccentricity, pad flexibility tends to reduce the journal eccentricity, similar as in tests reported by Gaines. A soft pad (elastic) decreases significantly the bearing stiffnesses and the damping coefficients by up to 20 %. A parametric study follows to quantify the influence of pad thickness on the rotordynamic force coefficients of two sample TPJBs: one with three pads of increasing preload, (p r = 0, 0. 25 and 0. 5), and another one with four pads of null preload (p r = 0). The bearing pads are either rigid or flexible by varying their thickness. For design considerations, dimensionless static and dynamic characteristics of the bearings are presented versus the Sommerfeld number (S). An appendix introduces a one-dimensional beam equation to approximate the pad deformation accounting for the Babbitt layer. Based on this equation, a dimensionless pad flexibility parameter is defined. Pad flexibility shows a more pronounced effect on the journal eccentricity and the force coefficients of a TPJB with null pad preload than for bearings with large pad preloads (0. 25 and 0. 5), in particular for operation with a small load or at a high surface speed (S> 0. 8). With the same pad preload, pad flexibility affects more the dynamic force coefficients for a <b>load</b> on <b>pad</b> (LOP) bearing than those for a <b>load</b> between <b>pad</b> (LBP) bearing...|$|R

The bearing has the following design parameters: 4 pads with pad arc angle 72 o and 50 % pivot offset, pad axial length 0. 0762 m (3 in), pad radial clearance 0. 254 mm (0. 010 in), bearing radial clearance 0. 1905 mm (0. 0075 in), preload 0. 25 and shaft nominal diameter of 0. 11684 m (4. 600 in). The dynamic coefficients and the static performance parameters of the FPB have been compared with the theoretical predictions using the isothermal analysis from the rotordynamic software suite XLTRC 2 -XLTFPBrg. The bearing shows a small attitude angle, about 10 o, which indicates small crosscoupling stiffnesses. The pad temperatures increase in the circumferential direction of rotation with speed and <b>load.</b> The <b>pads</b> maximum temperature was measured near the trailing edge. The dependency of the stiffness and damping coefficients on the excitation frequency has been studied. The frequency dependency in the dynamic coefficients was removed by introducing an added mass coefficient to the bearing model. The direct added mass coefficients were around 32 kg. The direct stiffness and damping coefficients increase with load, while increasing and decreasing with rotor speed, respectively. A small whirl frequency ratio (WFR) was found of about 0. 15, and it decreases with load and increases with speed. A comparison between the dynamic stiffnesses using a Reynolds equation and the bulk-flow Navier-Stokes models with the experimental dynamic stiffnesses shows that the Reynolds model (even for laminar flows) is not adequate, and that the bulk-flow model {{should be used for}} rotordynamic coefficients prediction.

40|$|Thermal fatigue due to beam interruptions is {{an issue}} that must be {{addressed}} in the design of an ATW blanket. Two different approaches can be taken to address this issue. One approach is to analyze current ATW blanket designs in order to set interrupt frequency design limits for the accelerator. The other approach is to assume that accelerator reliability can not be guaranteed before design and construction of the blanket. In this approach the blanket must be designed so as to accommodate an accelerator with a beam interruption frequency significantly higher than current high power accelerators in order to provide a margin of error. Both approaches are considered in this paper. Both a sodium cooled blanket design and a lead-bismuth cooled blanket design are considered. Thermal hydraulic analysis of the blanket for beam interruption transients is carried out with the SASSYS- 1 systems analysis code to obtain the time histories of the coolant temperatures in contact with structural components. These coolant temperatures are then used in a detailed structure temperature calculation to obtain structure surface and structure average temperatures. The difference between the average temperature and the surface temperature is used to obtain thermal strains. Low cycle fatigue curves from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code are used to determine the number of cycles that the structural components can endure, based on these strains. Calculations are made for base case designs and for a number of mitigation options. The mitigation options include using two separate accelerators to provide the beam, reducing the thickness of the above core <b>load</b> <b>pads</b> in the subassemblies, increasing the coolant flow rate or reducing power {{in order to reduce the}} core temperature rise, and reducing the superheat in the once-through steam generator...|$|R
50|$|The third {{match that}} aired was a Fight Without Honor between Eddie Kingston and Chris Hero. The match began with both men brawling, until Hero got {{the upper hand}} by using a steel chain on Kingston, making him bleed. In {{the middle of the}} match, Hero removed a section of the {{barricade}} and placed it in the ring, balancing it on the ring ropes to form a platform. Hero then ganso powerbombed Kingston from the top rope onto the barricade for a near-fall. Kingston took the advantage by using the steel chain, and performed a capture suplex on Sara Del Rey, Hero's manager, when she interfered in the match. Kingston won the match by pinfall after performing Hero's own finishing move, the Rolling Elbow, on Hero while wearing Hero's <b>loaded</b> elbow <b>pad.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the heel pad {{mechanical}} properties of runners, who repetitively <b>load</b> the heel <b>pad</b> during training, with cyclists who do not <b>load</b> their heel <b>pads</b> during training. Ten competitive long distance runners and 10 competitive cyclists volunteered for this study. The thickness of the unloaded heel pad was measured using realtime B-mode ultrasonography. A heel pad indentation device was used to measure the mechanical properties of the heel pads. To evaluate the differences between the two groups, in heel pad properties, a repeat measures analysis of variance was used (p <. 05.) Heel pad thickness was not different between groups when normalized with respect to subject height. There was no significant difference between the groups in percentage energy loss during loading and unloading (runners: 61. 4 % +/- 8. 6; cyclists: 62. 5 % +/- 4. 6). Heel pad stiffness for the runners was statistically significantly less than that of the cyclists (p =. 0018; runners: 17. 1 N. - 1 +/- 3. 0; cyclists: 20. 4 N. - 1 +/- 4. 0). These results indicate that the nature of the activity undertaken by individuals may influence their heel pad properties. This finding may be important when considering differences in heel pad properties between different populations...|$|R
40|$|Static {{and dynamic}} {{performance}} test results are provided for a horizontal-application three-lobe bearing evaluated {{over the following}} range of static-load orientations (all taken from {{the leading edge of}} the <b>loaded</b> <b>pad)</b> : 0 ?, 20 ?, 30 ?, 40 ?, 60 ?, 80 ?, 90 ?, and 100 ?. This bearing has the following specifications: 100 ? pad arc angle, 0. 52 preload, 70 % offset, 101. 74 mm (4. 0057 in) minimum bore diameter, 0. 116 mm (7. 55 mils) radial pad clearance, and 76. 3 mm (3 in) axial length. The static and dynamic test results are evaluated to determine the sensitivity of the bearing to changes in the static load direction. The two questions the study aims to answer are: (1) ?Is an offset three-lobe bearing a good choice when the radial static load vector represents an unknown variable?? and (2) ?Can an offset three-lobe bearing be oriented advantageously with a known load direction?? Both the static and dynamic test results are compared to predictions obtained from a fixed-arc bearing Reynolds equation solver. Predictions using both the measured hot clearance and measured cold clearance as inputs are compared to the measured data. Dynamic tests show that the horizontal-application three-lobe bearing is sensitive to load orientation at low speeds and high loads. Whirl-frequency ratios (WFR) at 6750 rpm with loads of 1149 kPa, 1723 kPa, and 2298 kPa are equal to zero for loads oriented towards {{the leading edge of the}} pad, and between 0. 35 and 0. 5 for loads oriented towards the trailing edge of the pad. This same general trend can be seen for WFR values at 9000 rpm and 10800 rpm. The horizontal-application three-lobe bearing is not sensitive to load orientation at high speeds and light loads. At 13200 rpm, measured WFRs are between 0. 3 and 0. 7 at all loads and for all load orientations. Measured WFR at the no-load condition are between 0. 45 and 0. 7 for all cases. Stiffness orthotropy was found to vary significantly with load orientation. At 6750 rpm and 2298 kPa, the bearing is most orthotropic when the static load orientation is 30 ? and 40 ?, with K_(yy) being larger than K_(xx) by approximately 800 MN/m. At 13200 rpm and 2298 kPa, the bearing is most orthotropic for the 40 ? and 100 ? load orientations, with K_(yy) being larger than K_(xx) by approximately 800 MN/m. Overall, it is concluded that the three-lobe bearing is not a good choice when the load direction is unknown, as the bearing can have different rotordynamic coefficients with different load orientations. Also, at high speeds, the three-lobe bearing cannot be oriented advantageously with a known load direction to enhance stability, as the WFR of the three-lobe bearing tested is largely independent of load direction. However, the three-lobe bearing can be oriented advantageously to split/change a critical speed, since the direct stiffness and stiffness orthotropy change with load direction. Additionally, dynamic performance test results are provided for a vertical-application (nominally unloaded) three-lobe bearing. The vertical-application bearing has the following specifications: 100 ? pad arc angle, 0. 64 preload, 100 % offset, 101. 74 mm (4. 0057 in) nominal diameter, 0. 116 mm (5. 27 mils) radial pad clearance, 76. 3 mm (3 in) axial length, and 100 ? static load orientation from the leading edge of the <b>loaded</b> <b>pad.</b> The performance of this bearing is evaluated to determine: (1) whether a fully (100 %) offset three-lobe bearing configuration is more stable in terms of the WFR than a standard plain journal bearing and (2) whether a fully offset three-lobe bearing provides a larger direct stiffness (centering force) than a standard fixed-arc bearing. Dynamic tests show that the vertical-application three-lobe bearing does not improve stability over conventional plain journal bearings. The measured WFRs for the vertical-application bearing are approximately 0. 4 - 0. 5 for nearly all test cases. Predicted WFRs are 0. 46 at all test points. The vertical-application bearing dimensionless direct stiffness coefficients are compared to those for the horizontal-application bearing. The equivalent stiffness for the vertical-application bearing is larger than that of the horizontal-application bearing by a factor of 1. 33 at 6750 rpm and a factor of 1. 25 at 9000 rpm. Thus, the vertical-application bearing does impart a larger centering force to the journal relative to the horizontal-application bearing when the journal is not carrying a radial static load...|$|R

40|$|Fulltext: Biocidal sprays are {{frequently}} used by consumers in indoor areas to control pests. To obtain data on indoor contaminations, different insecticide aerosol sprays were applied in furnished model rooms (40 m³). On the one hand, the sprays were used {{according to the}} manufacturers' instructions (spraying for about 10 - 20 sec), {{and on the other}} hand under worst-case conditions (spraying for 2 min). Within two weeks, four spray applications with correct use and three worst-case applications were performed. Indoor air was collected a) during the spraying process, b) 2 - 4 h after spraying (in case of correct use the room was ventilated for 30 min), and c) about two weeks after the last application. The applied sprays contained i) tetramethrin/d-phenothrin (0. 15 g/ 0. 15 g), ii) pyrethrum extract/PBO (0. 25 g/ 1 g), and iii) chlorpyrifos/bioallethrin/PBO (0. 5 g/ 0. 15 g/n. s.) per 100 g spray. During spraying, concentrations of biocides in the air (mean values from 3 or 4 measurements) ranged from 100 - 1020 µg/m³ for correct use (290 - 6020 µg/m³ for worst case). Highest concentrations of 2510 µg/m³ (10340 µg/m³) were measured for the synergist PBO. Two to four h after application, concentrations of the active ingredients in the indoor air were down to 0. 1 - 0. 8 % (1 - 11 % for worst case). Three weeks after the last application, concentrations between 0. 02 - 1 µg/m³ were measured for both scenarios. To determine the surface <b>load,</b> <b>pads</b> of filter paper were placed horizontally at different positions in the room. The amounts of active ingredients were determined at different times (after first and last applications and about two weeks later). Concentrations varied from 10 - 480 ng/cm² (70 - 5700 ng/cm² for worst case) for biocides and from 300 - 2260 ng/cm² (1000 - 16500 ng/cm² for worst case) for PBO. After 2 weeks, bioallethrin had been degraded, the other biocide concentrations were down to 10 - 40 % (40 - 70 % for worst case). The PBO value remained constant over time...|$|R
