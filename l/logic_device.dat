25|$|In {{a digital}} circuit, an FSM may be built using a {{programmable}} <b>logic</b> <b>device,</b> a programmable logic controller, logic gates and flip flops or relays.

2500|$|The first purchasable/mass-{{produced}} scanner was the Coemar Robot, first {{produced in}} 1986. Initially produced {{with either the}} GE MARC350 lamp, or the Philips SN250. Later versions were factory equipped with the Osram HTI400, a modification that High End Systems had been doing since 1987. The Robot used model aircraft servo motors to control Pan, Tilt, Color and Gobo, with the gobo wheel providing the shutter function as well. The Color wheel had 4 dichroic color filters ( [...] Red, Blue, yellow, and Green), and the gobo wheel contained 4 stamped patterns (non-replaceable).

40|$|The {{ultrahigh}} {{demand for}} faster computers is currently tackled by traditional {{methods such as}} size scaling (for {{increasing the number of}} devices), but this is rapidly becoming almost impossible, due to physical and lithographic limitations. To boost the speed of computers without increasing the number of <b>logic</b> <b>devices,</b> one of the most feasible solutions is {{to increase the number of}} operations performed by a device, which is largely impossible to achieve using current silicon-based <b>logic</b> <b>devices.</b> Multiple operations in phase-change–based <b>logic</b> <b>devices</b> have been achieved using crystallization; however, they can achieve mostly speeds of several hundreds of nanoseconds. A difficulty also arises from the trade-off between the speed of crystallization and long-term stability of the amorphous phase. We here instead control the process of melting through premelting disordering effects, while maintaining the superior advantage of phase-change–based <b>logic</b> <b>devices</b> over silicon-based <b>logic</b> <b>devices.</b> A melting speed of just 900 ps was achieved to perform multiple Boolean algebraic operations (e. g., NOR and NOT). Ab initio molecular-dynamics simulations and in situ electrical characterization revealed the origin (i. e., bond buckling of atoms) and kinetics (e. g., discontinuouslike behavior) of melting through premelting disordering, which were key to increasing the melting speeds. By a subtle investigation of the well-characterized phase-transition behavior, this simple method provides an elegant solution to boost significantly the speed of phase-change–based in-memory <b>logic</b> <b>devices,</b> thus paving the way for achieving computers that can perform computations approaching terahertz processing rates.
