The <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>emission</b> test is currently required only for vehicles with positive ignition engines.

40|$|Abstract. In many {{clusters}} of galaxies, the cooling {{time at the}} core of the intracluster medium is much less than the age of the system, suggesting that the the gas should continually lose energy by radiation. Simple thermodynamic arguments then require that the expected “cooling flow” should exhibit a specific spectroscopic signature, characterized by a differential emission measure distribution that is inversely proportional to the cooling function of the plasma. That prediction can be quantitatively tested for the first time by the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) experiment on XMM-Newton, which provides high resolution X-ray spectra, even for moderately extended sources like clusters. We present RGS data on 14 separate cooling flow clusters, sampling a very wide range in mass deposition rate.

At the ensemble level, the absorption and fluorescence spectra show a temperature dependence similar to plant PS II. We report emission spectra of single PS II cc for the first time; the spectra are dominated by zero-phonon lines (ZPLs) in the range between 680 and 705 nm.

The average emission spectrum obtained from more than hundred single complexes shows three main contributions that are in good agreement with the reported bands F 685, F 689 and F 695. The intensity of F 695 is found to be lower than in conventional ensemble spectroscopy. The reason for the deviation might be due to the accumulation of triplet states on the red-most chlorophylls (e. g. Chl 29 in CP 47) or on carotenoids close to these long-wavelength traps by the high excitation power used in the single-molecule experiments. The red-most emitter will not contribute to the fluorescence spectrum {{as long as it is}} in the triplet state. In addition, quenching of fluorescence by the triplet state may lead to a decrease of long-wavelength emission...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid {{perovskite}} {{thin films}} have demonstrated impressive performance for solar energy conversion and optoelectronic applications. However, further progress {{will benefit from}} a better knowledge of the intrinsic photophysics of materials. Here, the <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>emission</b> properties of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 single crystals are investigated and compared to those of thin polycrystalline films by means of steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. While the emission properties of thin films and crystals appear relatively similar at room <b>temperature,</b> <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals striking {{differences between the two}} materials. Single crystals photoluminescence exhibits a sharp excitonic emission at high energy, with Full Width at Half Maximum of only 5 meV, assigned to free excitonic recombination and a broad band at low energy. We analyzed the thermal evolution of the free excitonic intensity and linewidth. An excitonic binding energy of 28 meV is extracted from the quenching of the photoluminescence. We highlight a strong broadening of the emission due to LO phonon coupling. The free excitonic emission turned to be very short-lived with a sub-nanosecond dynamics, mainly induced by the fast trapping of the excitons. The free excitonic emission is completely absent of the thin films spectra, which are dominated by trap states band. The trap states energies, width and recombination dynamics present important similarities between films and crystals. These results suggest that the trap states are formed at the surface and grain interface of perovskites. Comment: 29 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
