A domed metal {{enclosure}} having a machined seal ring is fitted to a glass post machined to a slight taper and to a desired surface finish. The metal part is then heated by induction in a vacuum. As the metal part heats and expands relative to the glass post, the metal seal ring, possessing a higher coefficient of expansion than the glass post, slides down the tapered post. Upon cooling, the seal ring crushes against the glass post forming the seal. The method results in a glass-to-metal seal possessing extremely good <b>leak</b> <b>resistance,</b> while the parts are kept clean and free of the contaminants...|$|E

40|$|Sepsis causes {{dysfunction}} of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVEC) {{leading to}} severe pulmonary edema. Metalloproteinases regulate endothelial function through processing of cell surface proteins, {{which can be}} associated with increased permeability. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP 3) regulates metalloproteinase activity in the lung following injury. Thus, we hypothesize TIMP 3 promotes PMVEC barrier function through inhibition of metalloproteinase activity. PMVEC were isolated from WT and Timp 3 -/- mice. TIMP 3 levels (mRNA and protein) were decreased in WT PMVEC under septic conditions. Analysis of <b>leak</b> (transendothelial electrical <b>resistance,</b> dextran, and albumin flux) revealed Timp 3 -/-PMVEC had significantly higher permeability under resting conditions vs. WT PMVEC. Increased basal Timp 3 -/- PMVEC permeability was associated with disrupted surface vascular endothelial-cadherin localization, both of which were rescued by treatment with GM 6001, a synthetic metalloproteinase inhibitor. Our data suggest TIMP 3 supports normal PMVEC barrier function, and septic downregulation of TIMP 3 may be an important contributor to septic PMVEC barrier dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Voltage clamp {{measurements}} reveal important {{insights into}} the activity of membrane ion channels. While conventional voltage clamp systems are available for laboratory studies, these instruments are generally unsuitable for more rugged operating environments. In this study, we present a non-invasive microfluidic voltage clamp system developed for the use under varying gravity levels. The core component is a multilayer microfluidic device that provides an immobilisation site for Xenopus laevis oocytes on an intermediate layer, and fluid and electrical connections from {{either side of the}} cell. The configuration that we term the asymmetrical transoocyte voltage clamp (ATOVC) also permits electrical access to the cytosol of the oocyte without physical introduction of electrodes by permeabilisation of a large region of the oocyte membrane so that a defined membrane patch can be voltage clamped. The constant low level air pressure applied to the oocyte ensures stable immobilisation, which is essential for keeping the <b>leak</b> <b>resistance</b> constant even under varying gravitational forces. The ease of oocyte mounting and immobilisation combined with the robustness and complete enclosure of the fluidics system allow the use of the ATOVC under extreme environmental conditions, without the need for intervention by a human operator. Results for oocytes over-expressing the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) obtained under laboratory conditions as well as under conditions of micro- and hypergravity demonstrate the high reproducibility and stability of the ATOVC system under distinct mechanical scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Polyethylene pipes, {{and other}} {{polymeric}} materials, are a popular {{choice in the}} water industry due to their advertised but exaggerated <b>leak</b> <b>resistance.</b> When leaks do occur in this pipe material, the complex leakage behaviour (time and pressure dependent) presents a challenge in accurately modelling the representative response. The presented research aimed to quantify the leak behaviour of longitudinal slits in viscoelastic water distribution pipes, considering the dynamic interaction of hydraulic conditions and the pipe section characteristics. A methodology was developed to create synergy between novel physical investigations and numerical simulations, evaluating the synchronous pressure, leakage, flow-rate and leak area to understand the interdependence of the leakage and structural dynamics. The synchronous leak area was confirmed as the critical parameter defining the leak response and is in turn dependent on the leak and pipe geometry, loading conditions and viscoelastic material properties. The theoretical discharge coeffcient was shown to remain constant, thereby establishing that the structural response, i. e. the change of leak area, can be determined by quantifying the leakage flow-rate and the pressure headalone. Derivation of a generalised leakage model effectively captured the dynamic leakage behaviour. However, the model may provide an erroneous estimate of the true response due {{to the exclusion of}} the influence of ground conditions. These were shown to result in a significant increase in slit face loading dependent on the specific soil matrix properties, simultaneously altering the structural deformation and net leakage. Alongside the advances in fundamental understanding, the research also has implications for leakage management strategies. The short term behaviour may severely hinder the effectiveness of leak localisation technologies and the quantification of risk associated with contaminant ingress. However, it was shown that current leakage modelling practice over relatively long time periods are not adversely affected by the existence of such dynamic leaks...|$|E
40|$|Background In {{aortic valve}} {{regurgitation}} (AR), aortic leak severity modulates left ventricle (LV) arterial system interaction. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess (1) how arterial elastance (E-a), calculated as the ratio of LV end-systolic pressure and stroke volume, relates to arterial properties and leak severity and (2) the validity of E-a/E-max (with E-max the slope of the-end-systolic pressure-volume relation) as a heart-arterial coupling parameter in AR. Methods and Results Our work is based on human data obtained from a study on vascular adaptation in chronic AR. These data allowed us to assess the parameters of a computer model of heart-arterial interaction. In particular, total peripheral resistance (R) and aortic leak severity-expressed as <b>leak</b> <b>resistance</b> (R-L,R-ao) -were quantified for different patient subgroups (group I/IIa/IIb: E-max = 2. 15 / 0. 62 / 0. 47 mm Hg/mL; E-a = 1. 24 / 0. 66 / 0. 90 mm Hg/mL; R = 1. 9 / 0. 6 / 0. 85 mm Hg-s/mL, R-L,R-ao = 0. 35 / 0. 05 / 0. 20 mm Hg-s/mL). A parameter study demonstrated that R-L,R-ao was the main determinant of E-a. With all other parameters constant, valve repair would increase E-a to 2. 81, 1. 08, and 1. 54 mm Hg/mL in groups I,IIa, and IIb, respectively. For a given E-a/E-max, LV pump efficiency (estimated as the ratio of stroke work and LV systolic pressure-volume area) was lower than the theoretical predicted value, except for the simulations with intact aortic valve. Conclusions In AR(a) E-a is determined by aortic leak severity rather than by arterial system properties. Using E-a/E-max as a coupling parameter in general or as a mechanico-energetic regulatory parameter in particular is questionable. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Since burst tests are not used in Section IX for resistance weld qualification, finite element results of canister resistance welds are compared with the finite element analysis results of resistance weld tests in ASME Section IX, QW- 196 to establish similarity between the two weld tests. Detailed analyses show that the primary mode of failure in both the tests is shear and, therefore, the use of burst test in place of shear test is acceptable.

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) forming of {{paperboard}} and heat sealing of lidding films to trays manufactured {{by the press}} forming process are investigated in this thesis. The aim of the work was to investigate and recognize the factors affecting the quality of heat sealing and the <b>leak</b> <b>resistance</b> (tightness) of press-formed, polymer-coated paperboard trays heatsealed with a multi-layer polymer based lidding film. One target was to achieve a solution {{that can be used}} in food packaging using modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). The main challenge in acquiring adequate tightness properties for the use of MAP is creases in the sealing area of the paperboard trays which can act as capillary tubes and prevent leak-proof sealing. Several experiments were made to investigate the effect of different factors and process parameters in the forming and sealing processes. Also different methods of analysis, such as microscopic analysis and 3 D-profilometry were used to investigate the structure of the creases in the sealing area, and to analyse the surface characteristics of the tray flange of the formed trays to define quality that can be sealed with satisfactory tightness for the use of MAP. The main factors and parameters that had an effect on the result of leak-proof sealing and must be adjusted accordingly were the tray geometry and dimensions, blank holding force in press forming, surface roughness of the sealing area, the geometry and depth of the creases, and the sealing pressure. The results show that the quality of press-formed, polymer-coated paperboard trays and multi-layer polymer lidding films can be satisfactory for the use of modified atmosphere packaging in food solutions. Suitable tools, materials, and process parameters have to be selected and used during the tray manufacturing process and lid sealing process, however. Utilizing these solutions and results makes it possible for a package that is made mostly from renewable and recyclable sources to be a considerable alternative for packages made completely from oil based polymers, and to achieve a greater market share for fibre-based solutions in food packaging using MAP...|$|E

Sectional pipeline repair technologies, considered by the authors, include those for the repair of loose joints of straight sections of pipelines and loose joints in the points of connection to secondary pipelines. Technologies analyzed by the authors also include those applied for the restoration of pipe shell cracks. Organic resins and bandages are to be used as repair materials. Besides, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the composition and properties of pumping resins injected into pipe cracks to restore the structural strength of pipelines and to assure their further reliable operation. Moreover, the authors assess the basic strengths of the bandage technology, including its low cost, low time consumption, and suitability to various types of pipeline damages (depressurization of joints, cracks, leaks, etc.). Besides, this method does not require any excavations, trenches, hoists or other machines. In particular, sections of underground pipelines, having diameters of 150 – 180 mm, may be repaired by specialized repair robots. Robots may be equipped with special-purpose devices, including cutter heads, bandage application heads, and color motion cameras. Besides, sectional repair of pipelines, having the diameter of up to 600 mm, may be performed using robots produced by Hachler Umwelttechnik, which are particularly efficient if the repair work is needed to be performed in the points of pipeline branching. The choice of specific pipeline repair methods and substantiation of their application are mainly driven by (1) the post-cleaning condition of a pipeline, (2) the findings of the telediagnostics, (3) options for arrangement and use of specialized machinery on location, and (4) feasibility of the pipeline operation in the course of repair works and procedures.

40|$|The many {{possible}} combinations of blanket materials, tritium generation and recovery systems, and power conversion systems were surveyed and a comprehensive set of designs were generated {{by using a}} common set of ground rules that include all of the boundary conditions that could be envisioned for a full- scale commercial fusion power plant. Particular attention was given to the effects of blanket temperature on power plant cycle efficiency and economics, the interdependence of the thermodynamic cycle and the tritium recovery system, and to thermal and pressure stresses in the blanket structure. The results indicate that, of the wide variety of systems that have been considered, the most promising employs lithium recirculated in a closed loop within a niobium blanket structure and cooled with boiling potassium or cesium. This approach gives the simplest and lowest cost tritium recovery system, the lowest pressure and thermal stresses, the simplest structure with the lowest probability of a <b>leak,</b> the greatest <b>resistance</b> to damage from a plasma energy dump, and the lowest rate of plasma contamination by either outgassing or sputtering. The only other blanket materials combination that appears fairly likely to give a satisfactory tritium generation and recovery system is a lithium-beryllium fluoride-Incoloy blanket, and even this system involves major uncertainties in the effectiveness, size, and cost of the tritium recovery system. Further, the Li$sub 2 $BeF$sub 4 $ blanket system has the disadvantage that the world reserves of beryllium are too limited to support a full-blown fusion reactor economy, its poor thermal conductivity leads to cooling difficulties and a requirement for a complex structure with intricate cooling passages, and this inherently leads to an expansive blanket with a relatively high probability of leaks. The other blanket materials combinations yield even less attractive systems. (auth...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Implementation of Physiologic Pressure Conditions in a Blood Vessel Mimic Bioreactor System Kevin Mark Okarski Tissue {{engineering}} {{has traditionally}} been pursued as a therapeutic science intended for restoring or replacing diseased or damaged biologic tissues or organs. Cal Poly’s Blood Vessel Mimic Laboratory is developing a novel application of tissue engineering {{as a tool for}} the preclinical evaluation of intravascular devices. The blood vessel mimic (BVM) system has been previously used to assess the tissue response to deployed stents, but under non-physiologic conditions. Since then, efforts have been made to improve the vessel and bioreactor’s ability to emulate in vivo conditions. The ability to tissue engineer constructs similar to their native tissue counterparts is heavily reliant upon controlling the environment and mechanical stimuli the construct is exposed to. Mimicking physiologic conditions influences cellular growth, proliferation, and differentiation. Two important mechanical stimuli are cyclic strain and wall shear stress. Previous work sought to improve these factors within the BVM bioreactor and resulted in the implementation of pulsatile perfusion and increased fluid viscosity. These previous bioreactor design modifications generated pulsatile pressures of approximately 80 mmHg and a wall shear stress of 6. 4 dynes/cm 2. However, physiologic pressure waveforms were not achieved. Studies in this thesis were carried out to implement an effective means of establishing a more physiologic pressure wave within the bioreactor that is accurate, consistent, and easily adjustable. As a result of conducting the present studies, modifications to the bioreactor system were made that uphold the overall goals of efficacy and efficiency. The desired pressure wave was created by setting the degree of pump tubing occlusion on the 3 -roller peristaltic pump head and using a water column to backpressure the bioreactor chamber. Maintaining a desired backpressure within the system necessitated {{the development of a new}} bioreactor chamber with increased extraluminal <b>leak</b> pressure <b>resistance.</b> The opportunity was also used to further improve upon the bioreactor chamber design to allow for 360 ° rotation to reduce cell sedimentation. Modifications to the bioreactor system required quantitative evaluation to assess their impact upon local flow dynamics to the tissue construct. A system model was created and evaluated using computational modeling. Through the work performed in this thesis, pulsatile pressure waves of approximately 120 / 80 mmHg were successfully established within the bioreactor. The ability to accurately model physiologic pressures will ultimately help yield tissue constructs more similar to native tissues – both healthy and pathological. The newly designed bioreactor chamber and computational model for the system will be helpful tools for implementing or evaluating future bioreactor developments or improvements. While the main objective of the thesis has been completed by creating a system capable of emulating physiologic pressure fluctuations, there still remains room for further improvements in back-pressuring and scaling the system, refining the rotational bioreactor chamber design, and building upon the complexity and accuracy of the computational model...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The Airflow Perturbation Device (APD) is a lightweight, {{portable}} device {{that can be}} used to measure total respiratory resistance as well as inhalation and exhalation resistances. There is a need to determine limits to the accuracy of APD measurements for different conditions likely to occur: leaks around the mouthpiece, use of an oronasal mask, and the addition of resistance in the respiratory system. Also, there is a need for resistance measurements in patients who are ventilated. Method Ten subjects between the ages of 18 and 35 were tested for each station in the experiment. The first station involved testing the effects of leaks of known sizes on APD measurements. The second station tested the use of an oronasal mask used in conjunction with the APD during nose and mouth breathing. The third station tested the effects of two different resistances added in series with the APD mouthpiece. The fourth station tested the usage of a flexible ventilator tube in conjunction with the APD. Results All <b>leaks</b> reduced APD <b>resistance</b> measurement values. <b>Leaks</b> represented by two 3. 2 mm diameter tubes reduced measured resistance by about 10 % (4. 2 cmH 2 O·sec/L for control and 3. 9 cm H 2 O·sec/L for the leak). This was not statistically significant. Larger leaks given by 4. 8 and 6. 4 mm tubes reduced measurements significantly (3. 4 and 3. 0 cm cmH 2 O·sec/L, respectively). Mouth resistance measured with a cardboard mouthpiece gave an APD measurement of 4. 2 cm H 2 O·sec/L and mouth resistance measured with an oronasal mask was 4. 5 cm H 2 O·sec/L; the two were not significantly different. Nose resistance measured with the oronasal mask was 7. 6 cm H 2 O·sec/L. Adding airflow resistances of 1. 12 and 2. 10 cm H 2 O·sec/L to the breathing circuit between the mouth and APD yielded respiratory resistance values higher than the control by 0. 7 and 2. 0 cm H 2 O·sec/L. Although breathing through a 52 cm length of flexible ventilator tubing reduced the APD measurement from 4. 0 cm H 2 O·sec/L for the control to 3. 6 cm H 2 O·sec/L for the tube, the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion The APD can be adapted for use in ventilated, unconscious, and uncooperative patients with use of a ventilator tube and an oronasal mask without significantly affecting measurements. Adding a resistance in series with the APD mouthpiece has an additive effect on resistance measurements, and can be used for qualitative calibration. A leak size of at least the equivalent of two 3. 2 mm diameter tubes can be tolerated without significantly affecting APD measurements. </p...|$|R
