40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we {{evaluate}} trends in <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> economic <b>vulnerability</b> in Ireland {{during the period}} 1994 - 2001. We also document changes in the consequences <b>of</b> such <b>vulnerability</b> for social exclusion and in the social demographic factors with which it is associated. Over {{time there was a}} sharp decline in economic vulnerability. Furthermore, the degree of differentiation between the vulnerable and non-vulnerable classes in relation to both economic exclusion and social exclusion, more broadly conceived, remained relatively constant. Ireland is characterised by <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> socio-economic inequality that place it at the more unequal end of the European spectrum. However, the dramatic reductions in <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>vulnerability</b> across the socio-economic spectrum demonstrate that the fruits of the economic boom have been distributed relatively widely. ...|$|R
50|$|Many {{models of}} {{psychopathology}} generally suggest {{that all people}} have some <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>vulnerability</b> towards certain mental disorders, but posit a large range of individual differences in {{the point at which}} a person will develop a certain disorder. For example, an individual with personality traits that tend to promote relationships such as extroversion and agreeableness may engender strong social support, which may later serve as a protective factor when experiencing stressors or losses that may delay or prevent the development of depression. Conversely, an individual who finds it difficult to develop and maintain supportive relationships may be more vulnerable to developing depression following a job loss because they do not have protective social support. An individual's threshold is determined by the interaction of diatheses and stress.|$|E

50|$|From the model, one can {{conclude}} that the amount a firm spends to protect information should generally be {{only a small fraction}} of the expected loss (i.e., the expected value of the loss resulting from a cyber/information security breach). More specifically, the model shows that it is generally uneconomical to invest in information security activities (including cybersecurity or computer security related activities) more than 37 percent of the expected loss that would occur from a security breach. The Gordon-Loeb model also shows that, for a given level of potential loss, the optimal amount to spend to protect an information set does not always increase with increases in the information set’s vulnerability. In other words, organizations may derive a higher return on their security activities by investing in cyber/information security activities that are directed at improving the security of information sets with a medium <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>vulnerability.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: A {{growing body}} of work shows the {{benefits}} of applying social cognitive behavioural theory to investigate infection control and biosecurity practices. Protection motivation theory {{has been used to}} predict protective health behaviours. The theory outlines that a perception of a lack <b>of</b> <b>vulnerability</b> to a disease contributes to a reduced threat appraisal, which results in poorer motivation, and is linked to poorer compliance with advised health protective behaviours. This study, conducted following the first-ever outbreak of equine influenza in Australia in 2007, identified factors associated with horse managers' perceived vulnerability to a future equine influenza outbreak. Results: Of the 200 respondents, 31. 9 % perceived themselves to be very vulnerable, 36. 6 % vulnerable and 31. 4 % not vulnerable to a future outbreak of equine influenza. Multivariable logistic regression modelling revealed that managers involved in horse racing and those on rural horse premises perceived themselves to have low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>vulnerability.</b> Managers <b>of</b> horse premises that experienced infection in their horses in 2007 and those seeking infection control information from specific sources reported increased <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> perceived <b>vulnerability</b> to a future outbreak. Conclusion: Different groups across the horse industry perceived differing <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>vulnerability</b> to a future outbreak. Increased vulnerability contributes to favourable infection control behaviour and hence these findings are important for understanding uptake of recommended infection control measures. Future biosecurity communication strategies should be delivered through information sources suitable for the horse racing and rural sectors. 10 page(s...|$|R

Corruption risks are identified through general assessment of institution's exposure to corruption and description of institution's areas and manners of decision-making with the assessment of exposure to corruption risks. In order to achieve best assessment all persons involved in different operational procedures within the institution should participate. This enables better insight and more qualitative identification of corruption risks, following by better measures for minimizing or elimination. General assessment and placement of an institution into a certain group on the basis of exposure to corruption risks (the least, medium and most exposed) enables to better address factors of corruption risks.|$|E

50|$|A system {{focused on}} {{providing}} auditory messaging capability for large outdoor areas, {{being able to}} project voice and sounds over large distances, {{without the need for}} a large number of speakers. These systems are commonly used on military bases and chemical manufacturing plants, for example. These technologies allow specific instructions to be broadcast over a large area, however they may be subject to substantial echo and weather-related effects; and furthermore, environmental noise may interfere with their effectiveness. This forces unnatural speech, {{on the part of the}} warning originator, and may render the communication difficult for the listener to comprehend. This fact has prompted some to primarily rely on tones and coded signals that the audience must be familiar with in advance. Even though these can be heard over a large area, the high-powered speakers require a connection to the communication originator via some sort of infrastructure, meaning they might have a certain <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>vulnerability</b> to disruption in the collection infrastructure. The alternative to the use of Giant Voice systems is to deploy large arrays of smaller lower power speakers, this approach also allows for greater specificity of message by location. When properly synchronized these speaker arrays can deliver more comprehensible speech, however these arrays will involve larger amounts of supporting infrastructure. Siemens and Federal Signal are two of the major commercial providers of Giant Voice systems being actively deployed at military bases, government facilities and industry, currently; with Federal Signal being one of the first providers of these types of systems, after the Pearl Harbor attack.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address a set of interrelated issues. These {{comprise}} increasing concerns about reliance on nationally based income poverty measures in the context of EU-enlargement, the relative merits of one dimensional versus multidimensional approaches to poverty and social exclusion and the continuing relevance of class based explanations of life chances. Identifying economically vulnerable groups we find that, contrary to the situation with national income poverty measures, <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>vulnerability</b> vary systematically across welfare regimes. The multidimensional profile of the economically vulnerable sharply differentiates them from the remainder of the population. While they are also characterised by distinctively higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> multiple deprivation, a substantial majority of the economically vulnerable are not exposed to such deprivation. Unlike the national relative income approach, the focus on economic vulnerability reveals a pattern of class differentiation that is not dominated by the contrast between the self-employed and all others. In contrast to a European-wide relative income approach, it also simultaneously captures the fact that absolute <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>vulnerability</b> are distinctively higher among the lower social classes in the less comprehensive and generous welfare regimes while class relativities are significantly sharper {{at the other end of}} the spectrum. economic vulnerability, poverty, social exclusion, welfare regimes, social class, multiple deprivation...|$|R
50|$|Culaea inconstans, {{commonly}} known as the brook stickleback, is a small fish (<87 mm) that occurs throughout the southern half of Canada and {{the northern part of the}} eastern United States. It is one of the smallest fishes in the region. Brackish water populations are uncommon but certainly exist. It extends down to the southern reaches of the Mississippi River - Great Lakes drainage basins. Populations also exist in Colorado and Nebraska to the west, and in Alberta, Manitoba, and Northwest Territory to the north. Though these are typically the native ranges of the brook stickleback, the species has been introduced to Alabama, Kentucky, Tennessee, northwestern Colorado, northeastern Utah and California, and even in parts of South Dakota and Washington State. Certain geographical distribution studies have found that certain populations may have been native in New Mexico and still exist today. Nebraska does have brook stickleback populations, but they are generally found in small streams in the northern portion of the state. The fish have been found in Nebraska since the early part of the nineteen hundreds. River drainages that sustain brook stickleback populations are the Loup, Middle Platt, Niobrara, and smaller distributions in the Lower Platte, Missouri River tributaries, North Platte, and South Platte. Though the species appears to have an abundant distribution across North America, the Nature Conservancy has declared the species to be a S3 (vulnerable) level. Reasons for the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>vulnerability</b> could be due to increased dam construction, especially in the eastern United States. This can lead to a destruction of habitat, increase in silted waterways, alteration of stream nutrient transport, and damaged breeding grounds. Alteration of stream dynamics could also lead to a change in predator frequency, thus exposing the brook stickleback to unforeseen predators.|$|E

The former uses link physical properties such as its length and the number of lanes, whilst the latter reflects aspects of the network flow. The application of the methodology on a synthetic network (based on Delft city, Netherland) demonstrates the ability of the technique to estimate variation in the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>vulnerability</b> under different scenarios. The method also allows exploration of how variation in demand and supply impact on overall network vulnerability, providing a new tool for decision makers to understand the dynamic nature of vulnerability under various events.
