50|$|The bonefishes' closest {{relatives}} are the tarpons and <b>ladyfishes</b> {{in the order}} Elopiformes. Bonefishes are unlike tarpons in that their mouths are under the snout rather than the end of it. Like tarpons and <b>ladyfishes,</b> bonefishes can breathe air via a modified swim bladder and are found in brackish waters. Bonefish larvae are leptocephalic.|$|E
50|$|The {{superorder}} Elopomorpha {{contains a}} variety of types of fishes that range from typical silvery-colored species, such as the tarpons and <b>ladyfishes</b> of the Elopiformes and the bonefishes of the Albuliformes, to the long and slender, smooth-bodied eels of the Anguilliformes. The one characteristic uniting this group of fishes is they all have leptocephalus larvae, which are unique to the Elopomorpha. No other fishes have this type of larvae.|$|E

40|$|Natural Resource {{management}} is evolving toward ensuring sustainable ecosystems rather than sustainable yields. Understanding how a species interacts with its environment is fundamental for sound ecosystem management. If we are progressing toward an ecosystem management approach, {{then we must}} first understand how a species interacts with its environment and how the environment affects a species population dynamics. <b>Ladyfish</b> (Elops saurus) are a valuable commercial and recreational species; however, limited information is available describing {{the importance of their}} habitat. To date, only a few studies have noted the environmental conditions during <b>ladyfish</b> field-collections, and only one study has investigated <b>ladyfish</b> nursery habitats in any detail. Given the economic importance of <b>ladyfish</b> in Florida (USA), the objective of this investigation was to define, for the first time, juvenile <b>ladyfish</b> relative abundance in association to environmental conditions and habitat use at multiple Florida estuaries. In addition, this investigation re-examined some of the scientific findings and conclusions of previous <b>ladyfish</b> studies; incorporated additional data sets; and evaluated available <b>ladyfish</b> data at a finer scale of phenomena. Overall, juvenile <b>ladyfish</b> were collected in waters with wide-ranging environmental conditions having a sandy bottom, but preferred specific locations with particular dissolved oxygen, pH, water temperature, and salinity levels according to their size...|$|R

40|$|At the {{foundation}} of managing wildlife is collecting accurate field data with appropriate sampling gears and methods under a strict experimental design and standardized protocols. To elucidate, monitor, and predict wildlife patterns {{in space and time}} requires the selection of specific sampling gears for the community or species of interest, especially for species that display spatial and temporal variability in distribution and abundance. Among the most challenging types of wildlife to examine in the field are marine fisheries resources given their expansive range, spatial and temporal distribution, and specific early life-history characteristics (e. g., habitat, environmental conditions, and recruitment patterns). Numerous studies have investigated the catch efficiency for various sampling gears and techniques; however, no information has ever been reported for <b>ladyfish</b> (Elops saurus), an economically valuable species in the southeastern United States and other world-wide regions. Given the importance of collecting <b>ladyfish</b> early life-history information, the purpose of this investigation was to evaluate, for the first time, the efficiency and selectivity of various field-sampling gears used in Florida waters to collect juvenile <b>ladyfish.</b> The specific objectives were to examine the sampling gear efficiency and selectivity on juvenile <b>ladyfish</b> relative abundance and length-frequency distribution among different water bodies. This investigation found that juvenile <b>ladyfish</b> abundance, size, and length frequency distribution significantly varied by sampling gear. In addition, the findings revealed that the most efficient gear for sampling juvenile <b>ladyfish</b> smaller than 100 mm SL were seines with an offshore deployment method. Despite detecting length frequency differences among sampling gears, no clear pattern was evident among estuaries. In general, seine catch efficiency decreased and gillnet efficiency increased with <b>ladyfish</b> size. To alleviate gear or sampling bias, results demonstrated that researchers need to use a variety of sampling gears to sample <b>ladyfish...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Ladyfish</b> (Elops sp) are {{a common}} and {{economically}} valuable coastal nearshore species found along coastal beaches, bays, and estuaries of the southeastern United States, and subtropical and tropical regions worldwide. Previously, <b>ladyfish</b> were a substantial bycatch in Florida’s commercial fisheries, but changes in regulations significantly reduced commercial landings. Today, <b>ladyfish</b> are still taken in commercial fisheries in Florida, but many are also taken by recreational anglers. Life-history information and research interest in <b>ladyfish</b> is almost non-existent, especially information on age and growth. Thus, the overarching {{purpose of this study}} was to expand our understanding of <b>ladyfish</b> age and growth characteristics. The specific objectives were to describe, for the first time, age, growth, and recruitment patterns of juvenile <b>ladyfish</b> from the east coast of Florida (USA). In the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), annual monthly length-frequency distributions were confounded because a few small individuals recruited throughout the year; monthly length-frequency data generally demonstrated a cyclical pattern. The smallest were collected in September and the largest in May. Post-hoc analysis showed no significant difference in length between August and May, or among the other months. In Volusia County (VC), annual monthly length-frequency distribution demonstrated growth generally occurred from late-winter and spring to summer. The smallest <b>ladyfish</b> were collected in February and the largest in August. On average, the absolute growth rate in the IRL was 36. 3 mm in 60 days or 0. 605 mm day− 1. Cohort-specific daily growth rates, elevations, and coincidentals were similar among sampling years. Cohort-specific growth rates ranged from 1. 807 in 1993 to 1. 811 mm day− 1 in 1994. Overall, growth was best (i. e., goodness of fit) described by exponential regression. On average, the absolute growth rate in VC was 28 mm in 150 days or 0. 1866 mm day− 1. Cohort-specific daily growth rates were significantly different among sampling years; however, the elevations and coincidentals were similar. Cohort-specific growth rates ranged from 1. 741 in 1994 to 1. 933 mm day− 1 in 1993. Mean <b>ladyfish</b> growth was best described by linear regression; however, natural growth was explained better by exponential regression. In the IRL, the corrected exponential growth equation yielded a size-at-age 1 of 156. 0 mm SL, which corresponded to an estimated growth rate of 0. 4356 mm day− 1. In VC, the corrected exponential growth equation yielded a size-at-age 1 of 80 mm SL corresponding to an estimated growth rate of 0. 2361 mm day− 1...|$|R

5000|$|Pacific <b>ladyfish</b> are pelagic, marine forms preferring either {{brackish}} {{or fresh}} water {{unless they are}} breeding. They prefer specific water depths {{of no more than}} 8 m. Little is known about the ecology of this species, but they are known to be highly carnivorous, feeding on smaller fish and crustaceans. [...] This behavior is very similar to their relative, the Atlantic <b>ladyfish.</b> Maximum size is relatively larger than most Arizona fish, reaching lengths of 1 m. A negative correlation exists between size and presence in the Colorado River. As they become larger in size, they enter more brackish waters for unknown reasons. Larval and juvenile stages of fish have large records of distribution near Rocky Point, in the Sea of Cortez tidal inlets. Their spawning areas are usually closer to coastal areas, because they use saltier waters for their young.|$|R
