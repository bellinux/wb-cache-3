5|$|Modern Leslie {{speakers}} have an 11-pin interface that {{is safer}} to service, as the mains power is carried separately using a standard IEC mains connector. The Hammond-Suzuki Leslie 2101 also includes line in and <b>line</b> <b>out</b> jacks, so a combo preamp {{is no longer}} required. Its settings can also be controlled via MIDI.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{offers several}} iPad accessories, {{most of which}} are {{adapters}} for the proprietary 30-pin dock connector, the iPad's only port besides the headphone jack. A dock holds the iPad upright at an angle, and has a dock connector and audio <b>line</b> <b>out</b> port. Each generation of iPad requires a corresponding dock. A dock that included a physical keyboard was only supported for the original iPad, but all generations are compatible with Bluetooth keyboards that also work with Macs and PCs. The iPad can be charged by a standalone power adapter ("wall charger") also used for iPods and iPhones, and a 10 W charger is included with the iPad.|$|E

5000|$|Some Christian {{churches in}} the U.S. still {{practice}} <b>lining</b> <b>out.</b> While some churches calling themselves Primitive Baptist or Regular Baptist use it, this form of singing predominates among the Old Regular Baptist churches. The practice is becoming attenuated in some of them—the leader will begin <b>lining</b> <b>out,</b> but after the first verse or two will say [...] "Sing on!", or {{a part of the}} service is <b>lined</b> <b>out</b> but other parts are not—so it is unclear how long it will survive.|$|R

5|$|Chicago White Sox manager Al López {{watched the}} game {{along with his}} {{pitching}} coach to scout their potential NL opponents for the World Series. The start of Game 1 was delayed 45 minutes due to rain, leaving only 18,297 fans in the stadium once the game was underway. The Dodgers opened the game quickly as Charlie Neal singled with one out, advanced to second base on a ground out, and scored on a single by Norm Larker to give the Dodgers an early 1–0 lead. Dodgers starter Danny McDevitt held the Braves scoreless in the first inning, but was driven from {{the game in the}} second. After a <b>line</b> <b>out</b> to open the inning Johnny Logan walked, Del Crandall singled, and Bill Bruton singled to bring home Logan and tie the game at 1. Larry Sherry entered in relief of McDevitt, who pitched just 1 innings. Carl Willey, the Braves' pitcher, reached base on an error to load the bases. Crandall then scored on a ground out by Bobby Ávila to give the Braves a 2–1 lead before Sherry finished out the second.|$|E
50|$|While {{studying}} in the National University of Ireland, Galway (NUIG) Molumphy <b>lined</b> <b>out</b> with the university's hurling {{team in the}} Fitzgibbon Cup.

50|$|Liston also <b>lined</b> <b>out</b> with Munster in the inter-provincial {{football}} {{competition and}} enjoyed much success. He first <b>lined</b> <b>out</b> with his province in 1979, however, Munster were defeated on that occasion. Liston's side lost out again in 1980, however, in 1981 {{he won his}} first Railway Cup winners' medal as Connacht were accounted for. It was the first of two titles in-a-row for Munster and for Liston. He <b>lined</b> <b>out</b> in the next three inter-provincial campaigns also, however, Munster were defeated on all three occasions.|$|R
5000|$|Egan has <b>lined</b> <b>out</b> in {{all grades}} for Offaly. He started in 2007 {{as a member}} of the county's minor hurling team before {{subsequently}} joining the Offaly under-21 team.

5|$|Construction {{began in}} earnest on 18 April 2013 after {{completion}} of remedial and preparatory works such as land acquisition, removal of vegetation, demolition of certain structures and remedial works on old mines in Midlothian, for which over £54 million was spent by Network Rail. The first task was the excavation of the track alignment through Monktonhall and the clearing of the site for Shawfair station. Construction of the line's first bridge, Rye Haugh Bridge at Millerhall, were underway on 6 August 2013 as part of works to deviate the <b>line</b> <b>out</b> of Edinburgh from Newcraighall before it returns to the original alignment. The 23-arch Newbattle Viaduct (or Lothianbridge Viaduct) was used by lorries removing spoil from the construction site which eased traffic on local roads.|$|E
5|$|News of Barras' {{departure}} led the British {{to realize}} that the Chesapeake was the probable target of the French fleets. By 31 August, Graves had moved his five ships of the <b>line</b> <b>out</b> of New York harbor to meet with Hood's force. Taking command of the combined fleet, now 19 ships, Graves sailed south, and arrived {{at the mouth of the}} Chesapeake on 5 September. His progress was slow; the poor condition of some of the West Indies ships (contrary to claims by Admiral Hood that his fleet was fit for a month of service) necessitated repairs en route. Graves was also concerned about some ships in his own fleet; Europe in particular had difficulty manoeuvring.|$|E
5|$|The Vestbanen Line was {{extended}} west from Vestbanen station towards Skillebekk in two stages, on 21 December 1898 {{and again on}} 23 June 1899. The Gamlebyen Line {{was extended}} further east on 17 November 1899 to Oslo Hospital. The Vålerenga Line, which ran east from the city centre, opened on 3 May 1900, and the Kampen Line, which ran parallel but further north, on 6 June 1900. The first street <b>line</b> <b>out</b> of Kristiania into Aker was opened in three stages {{as an extension of}} the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line: on 29 September 1899 to Torshov, on 2 October 1901 to Sandaker and, finally, to Grefsen Station on 28 November 1902. For the electrification, KSS ordered 47 new trams from Falkenried and Waggonfabrik Linke-Hoffmann; these remained in service until 1967. In 1900, the tramway had a ridership of almost 17 million passengers, or 75 trips per inhabitant.|$|E
50|$|Browne {{has also}} <b>lined</b> <b>out</b> for Munster in the inter-provincial series of games.

50|$|The academy was {{purpose-built}} in 2003, {{designed by}} architects Howarth Litchfield Partnership and consulting engineers Cundall, and constructed by Surgo Construction. Its accommodation comprises over 80 classrooms, 12 seminar rooms, a main hall (seating 500) and lecture theatre (seating 269), a large sports hall (<b>lined</b> <b>out</b> for basketball, tennis, badminton, five-a-side football and with indoor cricket nets), a dance studio and fitness suite, school library, sixth form study centre and common room, drama studio and music recording studio, two restaurants, a full size floodlit astroturf pitch (<b>lined</b> <b>out</b> for hockey and football), a large hard court multi-use games area (<b>lined</b> <b>out</b> for netball and tennis) and extensive playing fields (<b>lined</b> <b>out</b> for football and rugby {{in the autumn}} and spring terms and for athletics and cricket in the summer term).|$|R
50|$|Two of Dunphy’s nephews later <b>lined</b> <b>out</b> {{for their}} native-county of Kilkenny. Dick Dunphy was the goalkeeping {{understudy}} to the legendary Ollie Walsh throughout the 1960s while Joe Dunphy Jnr. captained Kilkenny to back-to-back All-Ireland titles at minor level in 1961 and 1962 before later <b>lining</b> <b>out</b> at senior level.|$|R
5|$|Travis Kvapil, who had {{the pole}} position, held the lead until he was passed by Carl Edwards on lap nine. The race was first stopped 63 laps later when a multi-car {{collision}} was triggered by Brian Vickers, and was restarted 17 minutes later, with Dale Earnhardt Jr. leading the field. A second red-flag period was triggered after Edwards ran into teammate Greg Biffle starting a chain-reaction accident involving a further ten drivers. Stewart led {{the field for the}} remainder of the race, until Regan Smith passed him below the yellow <b>line</b> (<b>out</b> of bounds line) on the final lap. Stewart was therefore handed the victory, and Smith was demoted from second to 18th. The race had a total of ten cautions, and 64 lead changes among 28 different drivers, setting a new Sprint Cup Series record.|$|E
5|$|Until 1880 the Met ran no goods trains, but goods trains {{ran over}} its tracks from 20 February 1866 when the GNR began {{a service to}} the LC via Farringdon Street, {{followed}} by a service from the Midland Railway from July 1868. The GNR, the GWR and the Midland all opened goods depots in the Farringdon area, accessed from the City Widened Lines. Goods traffic was {{to play an important}} part of Met traffic on the extension <b>line</b> <b>out</b> of Baker Street. In 1880, the Met secured the coal traffic of the Harrow District Gas Co., worked from an exchange siding with the Midland at Finchley Road to a coal yard at Harrow. Goods and coal depots were provided at most of the stations on the extension line as they were built. Goods for London were initially handled at Willesden, with delivery by road or by transfer to the Midland. The arrival of the GCR gave connections to the north at Quainton Road and south via Neasden, Acton and Kew.|$|E
5|$|Mail {{service was}} chaotic during the stampede. Apart {{from the number}} of prospectors, two major {{obstacles}} stood in its way. To begin with, any mail from America to Dawson City was sent to Juneau in South-east Alaska before being sent through Dawson and then down the Yukon to Circle City. From here it was then distributed by the US Post Office back up to Dawson. The huge distances involved resulted in delays of several months and frequently the loss of protective envelopes and their addresses. The second problem was in Dawson itself, which initially lacked a post office and therefore relied on two stores and a saloon to act as informal delivery points. The NWMP were tasked to run the mail system by October 1897, but they were ill-trained to do so. Up to 5,700 letters might arrive in a single shipment, all of which had to be collected in person from the post office. This resulted in huge queues, with claimants lining up outside the office for up to three days. Those who had no time and could afford it would pay others to stand in line for them, preferably a woman since they were allowed to get ahead in <b>line</b> <b>out</b> of politeness. Postage stamps, like paper in general, were scarce and rationed to two per customer. By 1899, trained postal staff took over mail delivery and relieved the NWMP of this task.|$|E
