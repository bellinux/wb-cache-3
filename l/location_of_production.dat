40|$|JEL Classification: R 12; R 3; C 51 In Denmark, the {{concentration}} <b>of</b> pig <b>production</b> is {{highest in the}} western part of the country. However, there may be even larger local differences in the number of pigs produced. In this study we analyze the determinants <b>of</b> the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> pig <b>production</b> in Denmark with particular focus on spatial externalities and the interaction between the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> pig <b>production</b> and upstream sector and slaughterhouses. It is the assumption that the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> slaughterhouses is influenced by the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the primary producers, implying that this variable is endogenous, whereas the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> primary producers is independent <b>of</b> the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> slaughterhouses. This is due to the fact that transportation costs of pigs are paid by the cooperatives owning the slaughterhouses. This assumption is tested applying a spatial econometric model. The model is estimated for 1999 and 2004. Furthermore, the impact of negative environmental externalities <b>of</b> pig <b>production</b> on <b>location</b> is analyzed. The results show that spatial externalities have a positive effect on the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> pig <b>production</b> whereas environmental regulation has an negative effect on location...|$|R

The batch process production model (Lin, CT and CR Wu (2004 a). Asia Pacific Journal of Operational Research, 21, 35 – 52) which considers two <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> one in each of two countries is extended to develop a decision valuation model to choose the two optimal locations to produce a good — one in each country. This extended model applies the real options approach (ROA) to determine the value <b>of</b> locating <b>production</b> in N countries. Moreover, a closed-form solution to the Continuous-Time Model Optimization Problem is derived. The optimal entry threshold value of a firm from country- 0 to country-(N - 1) is calculated; a sensitivity analysis is performed, and some characteristic strategies of the operating method for the Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) batch process model among N countries are determined. Next, we can get optimal entry threshold value for Cobb-Douglas, perfect substitution and Leontief by CES production function. A useful summary of insights is provided for global managers.

5000|$|After {{the liberation}} from the Japanese in 1945, and the {{subsequent}} coup d’etat in 1961, by Park Chung Hee, there existed only one legal trade union federation in Korea, the Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU). Park’s regime was truly authoritarian, to the extent he suppressed all political and business leaders they deemed corrupt. In essence, he arbitrarily restructured the unions and permitted only those he and his regime regarded as [...] "loyal" [...] to their cause. As a result, {{for almost two decades}} under the military regime of President Park, FKTU was substantially weakened and became subordinate to the repressive state and capital, the family owned conglomerates or chaebol, who dominated and monopolized the industries in Korea who incessantly expanded with the help from the government. Hence, the labor movement became very fragmented; nevertheless, they operated through localized unions, such as the miners, textile workers, anti-political activists, and various Catholic groups. By the 1990s, with the demise of the military regimes, chaebol groups of Korea began to reassert themselves with the introduction of automation production processes, decentralized factory <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> sights, and began to relocate the production to overseas, exacerbating the situation even further.|$|E
