5000|$|In many countries, every motorcycle's <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> {{has been}} wired to {{illuminate}} whenever {{the engine is}} running, either {{as a matter of}} law or of voluntary industry practice. Some motorcycling advocacy groups are concerned over the potential for reduced motorcycle [...] with the introduction of headlamp-based DRLs on cars and other dual-track vehicles, since it means motorcycles are no longer the only vehicles displaying headlamps during the day. Some researchers have suggested that amber DRLs be reserved for use exclusively on motorcycles, in countries where amber is not presently a permissible color for DRLs on any vehicles, while other research has concluded there is a safety disbenefit to two 90 mm x 520 cd DRLs on motorcycles in comparison to one 190 mm x 270 cd dipped (low) beam headlight. The latter result suggests that DRL luminous area may have an important influence on its effectiveness.|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} daylight with 32 participants to determine whether left turning drivers’ gap acceptance in front of approaching motorcycles depends on the motorcycle’s forward lighting treatment. Five experimental lighting treatments including a modulated high beam headlamp, or the <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> plus pairs of low-mounted auxiliary lamps, high-mounted auxiliary lamps, both high- and low-mounted auxiliary lamps, or low-mounted LED lamps were compared to a baseline treatment with only the <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> illuminated. Participants viewed the approaching traffic stream (including the motorcycle) on an active roadway and indicated {{when it would be}} safe (and not safe) to initiate a left turn across the opposing lanes. Participants also shared their attention with a secondary visual distraction task that took their eyes off the forward roadway. Participants did not know {{that the purpose of the}} study was to measure their responses to approaching motorcycles. Based on participants’ indications of the last safe moment to turn, the mean temporal safety margin provided to the approaching motorcycle did not differ significantly between any of the experimental lighting treatments and the baseline treatment. However, having either low-mounted auxiliary lamps or modulated high beam lamps on the motorcycle significantly reduced the probability of obtaining a potentially unsafe short safety margin as compared to the baseline lighting treatment. Overall, the results suggest that enhancing the frontal conspicuity of motorcycles with lighting treatments beyond an illuminated <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> may be an effective countermeasure for daytime crashes involving right-of-way violations...|$|E
25|$|They are {{sometimes}} used {{in place of}} dipped-beam headlamps, reducing the glare-back from fog or falling snow, although the legality varies by jurisdiction of using front fog lamps without <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps.</b>|$|R
25|$|Prior to the DRL mandate, {{countries}} requiring daytime lights permitted <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> {{to provide}} that function. National regulations in Canada, Sweden, Norway, Slovenia, Finland, Iceland, and Denmark require hardwired automatic DRL systems of varying specification. DRLs are permitted in many countries where they are required, but prohibited in other countries not requiring them.|$|R
50|$|In the past, Germany, Spain, France {{and other}} European {{countries}} have encouraged or required daytime use of <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> on certain roads {{at certain times}} of year; Ireland encourages the use of <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> headlights during the winter, Italy, Hungary and Romania require daytime running lamps outside populated areas, and Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia and Slovenia {{require the use of}} full or reduced voltage <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> headlights at all times. Whether this requirement is met by the DRLs required on new cars since February 2011 is a matter of individual countries' laws.|$|R
2500|$|... {{or special}} running lamps, except such {{vehicles}} as comply fully with UN Regulation 48 regarding installation of lighting equipment. A dim-dip device operates the <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> (called [...] "dipped beam" [...] in the UK) at between 10% and 20% of normal low-beam intensity. The running lamps permitted {{as an alternative}} to dim-dip were required to emit at least 200 candela straight ahead, and no more than 800 candela in any direction. In practice, most vehicles were equipped with the dim-dip option rather than the running lamps.|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{prevailing}} {{regulations and}} vehicle equipment, the {{daytime running light}} function may be implemented by functionally specific lamps, by operating the <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> or fog lamps at full or reduced intensity, by operating the high-beam headlamps at reduced intensity, or by steady-burning operation of the front turn signals. Compared to any mode of headlamp operation to create the daytime running light, functionally dedicated DRLs maximize the potential benefits in safety performance and minimize fuel consumption, glare, motorcycle masking, and other potential drawbacks.|$|R
2500|$|Projector main {{headlamps}} {{first appeared}} in 1981 on the Audi Quartz, the Quattro-based concept car designed by Pininfarina for Geneva Auto Salon. Developed more or less simultaneously in Germany by Hella and Bosch and in France by Cibié, the projector <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> permitted accurate beam focus and a much smaller-diameter optical package, though a much deeper one, for any given beam output. The version of the 1986 BMW 7 Series (E32) sold outside North America was the first volume-production auto to use polyellipsoidal <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps.</b> [...] The main disadvantage {{of this type of}} headlamp is the need to accommodate the physical depth of the assembly, which may extend far back into the engine compartment.|$|R
5000|$|UK {{regulations}} briefly required vehicles {{first used}} on or after 1 April 1987 to {{be equipped with}} a dim-dip deviceor special running lamps, except such vehicles as comply fully with UN Regulation 48 regarding installation of lighting equipment.

The dim-dip system operated the <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> (called [...] "dipped beam" [...] in the UK) at between 10% and 20% of normal <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> intensity. The running lamps permitted as an alternative to dim-dip were required to emit at least 200 cd straight ahead, and no more than 800 cd in any direction. In practice, most vehicles were equipped with the dim-dip option rather than the running lamps.|$|R
2500|$|In 1992 {{the first}} {{production}} <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> HID <b>headlamps</b> were manufactured by Hella and Bosch beginning in 1992 for optional availability on the BMW 7 Series. This first system used a built-in, non-replaceable burner without a UV-blocking glass shield or touch-sensitive electrical safety cutout, designated D1 – a designation {{that would be}} recycled years later for a wholly different type of burner. The AC ballast was {{about the size of}} a building brick.|$|R
2500|$|... "Dipping" [...] (<b>low</b> <b>beam)</b> <b>headlamps</b> were {{introduced}} in 1915 by the Guide Lamp Company, but the 1917 Cadillac system allowed the light to be dipped with a lever inside the car rather than requiring the driver to stop and get out. The 1924 Bilux bulb was the first modern unit, having the light for both low (dipped) and high (main) <b>beams</b> of a <b>headlamp</b> emitting from a single bulb. A similar design was introduced in 1925 by Guide Lamp called the [...] "Duplo". In 1927, the foot-operated dimmer switch or dip switch was introduced and became standard {{for much of the}} century. 1933–34 Packards were equipped with tri-beam headlamps, the bulbs having three filaments. From highest to <b>lowest,</b> the <b>beams</b> were called [...] "country passing", [...] "country driving" [...] and [...] "city driving". The 1934 Nash also used a three-beam system, although in this case, the bulbs were conventional two-filament type, and the intermediate <b>beam</b> combined <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> on the driver's side with high beam on the passenger's side, so as to maximise the view of the roadside while minimizing glare toward oncoming traffic. The last vehicle with a foot-operated dimmer switch were the 1991 Ford F-Series and E-Series [...] vans. Fog lamps were new for 1938 Cadillacs, and their 1954 [...] "Autronic Eye" [...] system automated the selection of high and <b>low</b> <b>beams.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lamps and reflectors: Front, side, {{and rear}} turn signals; brake lights, {{front and rear}} {{position}} lights, hazard warning lights, rear reflectors, <b>low</b> and high <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> are all required. Sidemarker reflectors and lights and fog and driving lamps are permitted. All devices must function correctly and emit or reflect the required colours of light.|$|R
40|$|This in-traf c study {{evaluated}} {{driving performance}} with and preference for high-intensity discharge (HID) <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps.</b> Subjects drove two identical lux-ury sedans. One vehicle {{was equipped with}} HID <b>low</b> <b>beams</b> {{and the other with}} tungsten halogen <b>low</b> <b>beams.</b> The main difference between the two beams was that the HID lamps provided more spread light. Driving performance was evalu-ated by analysing steering frequencies. The hypothesis was that the wider beam pattern of the HID lamps would be bene cial by reducing the steering effort in the 0. 3 – 0. 6 Hz range, which has been used in previous studies as an index of steering-task dif culty. The main nding is that the wider HID beam pattern made lane maintenance less demanding, as measured by a reduction in the steering frequencies between 0. 3 and 0. 6 Hz. The implication is that HID headlamps may be bene cial to safety, because their wider beam pattern allows more of the limited information processing resources of drivers to be allocated to other tasks. When the subjects were not primed before driving {{to pay attention to the}} headlamps, they did not show, as a group, preference for either type of lamp. However, when they were told to pay attention to the headlamps, they overwhelmingly preferred the HID lamps. ...|$|R

Introduced <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> HID <b>headlamps.</b> The headlights were also equipped with a programmable delay feature for proximity illumination. In February 2000, the limited [...] "Platinum Series" [...] LS 400 was introduced at the Chicago Auto Show in partnership with American Express. The edition featured most luxury options as standard, along with separate exterior colors, wheels, badging, and two years' no-fee use of an American Express Platinum Card.|$|R
2500|$|Safety {{features}} include ASC+T traction control, headlight washers, auto-leveling <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> xenon HID <b>headlamps.</b> Side tubular airbags (called [...] "Head Protection System) were {{fitted as standard}} equipment. [...] "Active Comfort Seats" [...] were introduced in 1998, to improve comfort and reduce fatigue for the driver and front passenger. This system uses two fluid-filled bladders which alternate in height.|$|R
5000|$|For {{model year}} 2017, the Nissan Pathfinder {{received}} an exterior update {{which includes a}} new fascia with restyled headlights and taillights and a new direct-injected V6 engine with CVT—outputting [...] and 259 lbft Nm. The headlights had LED projector <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> and LED daytime running lights standard on Platinum trim levels while S, SV, and SL trim levels offer restyled halogen projector headlights with LED daytime running lights. Restyled LED taillights will be standard on Platinum trim levels, and all 2017 Pathfinders will also have new exterior colors added. The 2017 Nissan Pathfinder also has new LED fog lamps which are available on all trim levels except the base S. The interior also has redesigned cup holders. A Motion Activated Liftgate is also now standard on SL and Platinum trim levels only {{as part of the}} power liftgate. The 2017 model year is also its 30th anniversary for the Nissan Pathfinder but there won't be any 30th anniversary special edition model for the 2017 Pathfinder. The Nissan Pathfinder will have a Midnight Edition trim level which will be higher than the Platinum trim level for its base MSRP and arrive in Early 2017 and the Nissan Altima, Sentra, Murano, Maxima and Rogue will also the Midnight Edition trim level added to their trim lineup in Early 2017.|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of traffic fatalities involving pedestrians occur {{at night and}} this is largely attributed to low illumination conditions. Yet, drivers tend to underuse their high beams despite the visibility benefits afforded to them. In the present study we report high beam usage rates during an open-road drive using a video camera-based method. Measurements of <b>low</b> and high <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> illuminance were also taken for all vehicles used in this study. The results indicate that drivers, on average, used their high beams 48 % of the time possible. Furthermore, there was a moderately negative relationship between <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> output and high beam use indicating that drivers whose <b>low</b> <b>beams</b> produced less illumination tended to use their high beams more often. Future research should empirically investigate this relationship to lend further insight into the mechanism by which beam output influences beam usage. Research that improves our understanding of drivers’ knowledge and use of high beams {{is likely to be}} important as headlighting technologies continue to advance...|$|R

The AC ballast was {{about the size of}} a building brick. In 1996 the first American-made effort at HID headlamps was on the 1996-98 Lincoln Mark VIII, which used reflector headlamps with an unmasked, integral-ignitor burner made by Sylvania and designated Type 9500. This was the only system to operate on DC, since reliability proved inferior to the AC systems. The Type 9500 system was not used on any other models, and was discontinued after Osram's takeover of Sylvania in 1997. All HID headlamps worldwide presently use the standardised AC-operated bulbs and ballasts. In 1999 the first worldwide Bi-Xenon HID headlights for both <b>low</b> and high <b>beam</b> were introduced on the Mercedes-Benz CL-Class.|$|R
25|$|<b>Low</b> <b>beam</b> (dipped beam, passing <b>beam,</b> meeting <b>beam)</b> <b>headlamps</b> {{provide a}} {{distribution}} of light {{designed to provide}} adequate forward and lateral illumination, with limits on light directed towards the eyes of other road users to control glare. This beam is intended for use whenever other vehicles are present ahead, whether oncoming or being overtaken.|$|R
25|$|Some {{countries}} permit {{or require}} vehicles to {{be equipped with}} daytime running lamps (DRL). Depending on the regulations {{of the country for}} which the vehicle is built, these may be functionally dedicated lamps, or the function may be provided by the <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> or high <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps,</b> the front turn signals, or the front fog lamps.|$|R
40|$|The project {{proposed}} {{a prototype of}} an adaptive car headlamps control using image processing. The adaptive headlamps system focuses on the lighting angle control of <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> in the <b>headlamps</b> which its light tracks moved horizontally. The controller in headlamps is based on image processing from a camera mounted on the car. Adaptive headlamps system consists of portable tiny computer of Raspberry Pi, Arduino microcontroller, and two stepper motors for {{the left and the}} right headlamps. The system was implemented on the headlamps of a Toyota Avanza car. The adaptive headlamps system could detect most types of cars ahead. It could decrease a ‘glare’ effect and increase the driver sight based on survey taken from the driver and the driver of opposite car. The system still couldn’t detect the opposite car with high intensity of light from braking lamps, as well as the light from the opposite front lamps...|$|R
25|$|Though {{the systems}} based on photoresistors evolved, growing more compact and {{moving from the}} {{dashboard}} to a less conspicuous location behind the radiator grill, they were still unable to reliably discern headlamps from non-vehicular light sources such as streetlights. They also did not dip to <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> when the driver approached a vehicle from behind, and they would spuriously dip to <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> in response to road sign reflections of the vehicle's own high <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps.</b> American inventor Jacob Rabinow devised and refined a scanning automatic dimmer system impervious to streetlights and reflections, but no automaker purchased the rights, and the problematic photoresistor type remained on the market through the late 1980s.|$|R

50|$|Sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> were {{introduced}} in the United States in 1939, and became mandatory from the following year until the 1984 model year. Cars prior and subsequent to that date could {{have a variety of}} shapes of headlamps, using any {{of a wide variety of}} replaceable bulbs. Halogen sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> appeared on U.S. cars in 1978 to enable halogen technology under Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108, which at the time required all headlamps to be of sealed beam construction; eventually halogen sealed beams came to dominate the sealed beam lamp market.|$|R
50|$|The {{limited range}} of {{standardized}} sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> sizes and shapes restricted styling options for automobiles. Replaceable-bulb headlamps provide the regulated light distributions while allowing greater design and engineering freedom.|$|R
25|$|The {{range of}} the beam can vary between 65 and 300 meters, {{depending}} on traffic conditions. In traffic, the <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> cutoff position is adjusted vertically to maximise seeing range while keeping glare out of leading and oncoming drivers' eyes. When no traffic is close enough for glare to be a problem, the system provides full high <b>beam.</b> <b>Headlamps</b> are adjusted every 40 milliseconds by a camera {{on the inside of}} the front windscreen which can determine distance to other vehicles. The S-Class, CLS-Class and C-Class also offer this technology. In the CLS, the adaptive high beam is realised with LED headlamps - the first vehicle producing all adaptive light functions with LEDs. Since 2010 some Audi models with Xenon headlamps are offering a similar system: adaptive light with variable headlight range control.|$|R
50|$|In 1957, the law changed slightly, {{permitting}} Americans {{to possess}} vehicles with four 5.75 in round sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps,</b> and in 1974, these lights {{were permitted to}} be rectangular as well.|$|R
2500|$|Forward {{illumination}} {{is provided}} by high- ("main", [...] "full", [...] "driving") and low- ("dip", [...] "dipped", [...] "passing") <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps,</b> which may be augmented by auxiliary fog lamps, driving lamps, or cornering lamps.|$|R
25|$|Dipped-beam (also called low, passing, or meeting <b>beam)</b> <b>headlamps</b> {{provide a}} light {{distribution}} to give adequate forward and lateral illumination without dazzling other road users with excessive glare. This beam is specified for use whenever other vehicles are present ahead.|$|R
50|$|Historically, one of {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} differences between UN and US regulations was the design and performance of headlamps. The Citroën DS shown here illustrates the large differences in headlamps during the 1940-1983 era when US regulations required sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Headlamps are {{generally}} {{required to produce}} white light, according to both ECE and SAE standards. ECE Regulation 48 currently requires new vehicles to be equipped with headlamps emitting white light. Different headlamp technologies produce different characteristic types of white light; the white specification is quite large and permits {{a wide range of}} apparent color from warm white (with a brown-orange-amber-yellow cast) to cold white (with a blue-violet cast). Previous ECE regulations also permitted selective yellow light, which from 1936 until 1993 was required on all vehicles registered in France. Selective yellow headlamps are no longer common, but are permitted in various countries throughout Europe as well as in non-European locales such as South Korea, [...] Japan and New Zealand. In Iceland, yellow headlamps are allowed and the vehicle regulations in Monaco still officially require selective yellow light from all vehicles' <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> and high <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps,</b> and fog lamps if present.|$|R
25|$|US laws {{required}} sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> on all vehicles between 1940 and 1983, {{and other}} countries such as Japan, United Kingdom and Australia also made extensive use of sealed beams. In most other countries, and in the US since 1984, replaceable-bulb headlamps predominate.|$|R
