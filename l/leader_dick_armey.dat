25|$|Starting with Republican Nicholas Longworth in 1925, and {{continued}} through the Democrats' control of the House from 1931 to 1995, save for Republican majorities in 1947–49 and 1953–55, all majority leaders have directly ascended to the Speakership brought upon by the retirement of the incumbent. The only exceptions during this period were Charles A. Halleck who became Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 1959 to 1965, Hale Boggs {{who died in a}} plane crash, and Dick Gephardt who became the Democrats' House leader but as Minority Leader since his party lost control in the 1994 midterm elections. Since 1995, the only Majority Leader to become Speaker is John Boehner, though indirectly as his party lost control in the 2006 midterms elections. He subsequently served as Republican House leader and Minority Leader from 2007 to 2011 and then was elected Speaker when the House reconvened in 2011.

500|$|Frank {{has been}} outspoken on many civil rights issues, {{including}} lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights. In 1987, he publicly {{came out as}} gay. In 1990, Frank was instrumental in crafting the 1990 Immigration Act, which restated the reasons for which a person could be denied entry into the country. [...] The act did not include [...] "sexual preference exclusion", reforming earlier immigration law which allowed persons to be excluded for a sexual deviance [...] "afflict". He said in a 1996 interview: [...] "I'm used to being in the minority. I'm a left-handed gay Jew. I've never felt, automatically, a member of any majority." [...] In 1995, then-Republican House Majority <b>Leader</b> <b>Dick</b> <b>Armey</b> famously referred to Frank as [...] "Barney Fag" [...] in a press interview. Armey apologized {{and said it was}} [...] "a slip of the tongue". Frank did not accept Armey's explanation, saying [...] "I turned to my own expert, my mother, who reports that in 59 years of marriage, no one ever introduced her as Elsie Fag." [...] In 1998, Frank founded the National Stonewall Democrats, the national LGBT Democratic organization.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1997, several House Republicans {{attempted}} to replace him as Speaker, claiming Gingrich's public image was a liability. The attempted [...] "coup" [...] began July 9 with a meeting of Republican conference chairman John Boehner of Ohio and Republican leadership chairman Bill Paxon of New York.

However, Armey balked at the proposal to make Paxon the new Speaker, and told {{his chief of staff}} to warn Gingrich. On July 11, Gingrich met with senior Republican leadership to assess the situation. He explained that under no circumstance would he step down. If he was voted out, there would be a new election for Speaker. This would allow for the possibility that Democrats, along with dissenting Republicans, would vote in Democrat Dick Gephardt as Speaker. On July 16, Paxon offered to resign his post, feeling that he had not handled the situation correctly, as {{the only member of the}} leadership who had been appointed to his position—by Gingrich—instead of elected.|$|E
