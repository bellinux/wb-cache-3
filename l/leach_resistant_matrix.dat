40|$|Metal waste {{generated}} from domestic nuclear operations for defense and commercial applications {{has led to}} a growing stockpile of radioactively contaminated scrap metal, much of which is stainless steel. This steel contains large quantities of strategic elements such as nickel and chromium and constitutes a valuable domestic resource [1]. A significant fraction of this material cannot be efficiently surface decontaminated, and burial of this material would be wasteful and expensive, since long term monitoring would be necessary in order to minimize environmental risk. Melt decontamination of this material would maintain the chemical pedigree of the stainless steel, allowing its controlled reuse within the nuclear community. This research addresses the melt decontamination of radioactively contaminated stainless steel by electroslag remelting (ESR). ESR is industrially used for the production of specialty steels and superalloys to remove a variety of contaminates and to improve metal chemistry. Correctly applied, it could maintain the specified chemistry and mechanical properties of the original material while capturing the radioactive transuranic elements in a stable slag phase. The ESR process also produces a high quality metal ingot free of porosity that can be directly forged or rolled into final shapes. The goal of this project was to optimize a melt decontamination process through a basic understanding of the factors which govern the partitioning of various radionuclides between the metal, slag, and gas phases. Radionuclides which are captured by a slag phase may be stabilized by promoting the formation of synthetic minerals within a <b>leach</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>matrix.</b> This research program included three segments. At Boston University, Prof. Uday Pal and his group conducted research to develop a fundamental understanding of thermochemical and electrochemical behaviors of slag/metal/radionuclide surrogate systems. This work combined experimental characterization and thermochemical modeling of these high temperature systems. The second segment utilized Sandia expertise and ongoing work in fundamental separation science and liquid metal processing technology to investigate and optimize ESR decontamination using representative surrogate compounds to represent contaminate radionuclides. This work evaluated partitioning of the surrogates between the slag and metal ingot in ESR experiments. Furnace operating parameters were systematically varied to determine the optimum slag processing conditions. The third effort in Russia conducted ESR melting experiments using contaminated stainless steel pipe electrodes doped with plutonium.

Relatively few reports exist on impregnating wood with nanometals or the changes that nanometals impart on wood durability [6, 7].

The waste is generated when fission products are removed from the electrolyte, LiCl-KCl eutectic. The waste form is a composite fabricated by hot isostatic pressing a mixture of glass frit and zeolite occluded with fission products and salt. Normalized release rate is less than 1 g/m{sup 2 }d for all elements in MCC- 1 leach test run for 28 days in deionized water at 90 C. This leach resistance is {{comparable to that of}} early Savannah River glasses. We are investigating how leach resistance is affected by changes in cationic form of zeolite and in glass composition. Composites were made with 3 forms of zeolite A and 6 glasses. We used 3 -day ASTM C 1220 - 92 (formerly MCC- 1) leach tests to screen samples for development purposes only. The leach test results show that the glass composites of zeolites 5 A and 4 A retain fission products equally well. Loss of Cs is small (0. 1 - 0. 5 wt%), while the loss of divalent and trivalent fission products is one or more orders of magnitude smaller. Composites of 5 A retain chloride ion better in these short-term screens than 4 A and 3 A. The more <b>leach</b> <b>resistant</b> composites were made with durable glasses rich in silica and poor in alkaline earth oxides. XRD show that a salt phase was absent in the <b>leach</b> <b>resistant</b> composites of 5 A and the better glasses but was present in the other composites with poorer leach performance.

40|$|An electrometallurgical {{process is}} being {{developed}} at Argonne National Laboratory to treat spent metallic nuclear fuel. In this process, the spent nuclear fuel is electrorefined in a molten salt to separate uranium from the other constituents of the fuel. The treatment process generates a contaminated chloride salt that is incorporated into a ceramic waste form. The ceramic waste form, a composite of socialite and glass, contains the fission products (rare earths, alkalis, alkaline earth metals, and halides) and transuranic radionuclides that accumulated in the electrorefiner salt. These radionuclides are incorporated into zeolite A, which can fully accommodate the salt in its crystal structure. The radionuclides are incorporated into the zeolite by high-temperature blending or by ion exchange. In the blending process the salt and zeolite are simply tumbled together at > 450 C (723 K), but in the ion exchange process, which yields a product more highly concentrated in fission products, the molten salt is passed through a bed of the zeolite. In either case, the salt-loaded zeolite A is mixed with glass frit and hot isostatically pressed to produce a monolithic <b>leach</b> <b>resistant</b> waste form.

In addition, future volumes of these problematic wastes will be produced as other mixed waste treatment methods such as incineration and melting are deployed. The current method used to stabilize salt waste for compliant disposal is grouting with Portland cement.

The synthesised CSTs and a commercial CST containing material, IONSIV®, were subjected to ion exchange studies and then the crystal phases present after HIPing were investigated. Cs-IONSIV® was thermally decomposed and converted to two major Cs-containing phases, Cs 2 TiNb 6 O 18 and Cs 2 ZrSi 6 O 15, and a series of other phases. Additionally the effect of metal addition on phase formation under HIP conditions was explored. The microstructure and phase assemblage of HIPed Cs-IONSIV® samples as a function of Cs content were examined using XRD, XRF, SEM and TEM/EDX.

After a while a pH-sensitive indicator bromocresol purple (BCP) and surfactant were incorporate into the sol-gel mixture. The percentage of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) which act as surfactant were varied to observe the effect of improving host material's nanostructure {{as well as the}} interaction between BCP and sol-gel matrices. The absorption peak of the BCP dye changed significantly in the presence of surfactant compared to pure VTES: TEOS mixture (control) in the range of 400 to 450 nm. The presence of BCP dye in the sol-gel mixture can be determined via FTIR spectrum with a =C–H stretch in aromatics observed at 3100 - 3000 cm- 1 which represented the aromatic of the BCP structure. The addition of BCP and surfactant had influenced the FTIR spectra of VTES: TEOS sol-gel materials. Addition of an anionic surfactant to the sol-gel mixtures was found to increase the BCP dye and the sol-gel matrices interaction, thus reducing the dye's tendency to leach.

The political analysis provided the criteria necessary to compare alternative storage forms. The technical areas of weapon useability and environmental safety were then computationally and experimentally explored and a vitrification implementation strategy postulated. The Monte Carlo Neutron Photon (MCNP) computer code was used to model the effect of blending WGPu with reactor grade Pu (RGPu). A mixture of 30 % RGPu and 70 % WGPu more than doubled the surface flux from a bare sphere of the mixture which assumedly correlates to a significantly increased predetonation probability. Rare earth diluents were also examined (using MCNP) for their ability to increase the compressed critical mass of the WGPu mixture. The rare earths (notably Eu) were effective in this regard. As Pu- 239 has a 24, 100 year half life, reactivity control in the long term is an environmental safety issue. Rare earths were investigated as criticality controllers due to their neutron absorption capabilities and insolubility in aqueous environments. Thorium (a Pu surrogate) and the rare earths Eu, Gd, and Sm were added to two standard frits (ARM- 1 and SRL- 165) and formed into glass. Aqueous leach tests were performed (using MCC- 1 P guidelines) to measure rare earth leaching and determine the added elements` effects on glass durability. Europium was much more <b>leach</b> <b>resistant</b> than boron in the glasses tested. The elements had no negative effect on the environmental durability of the glasses tested at 90 C and minimal effect at room temperature. No fission product releases were detected in the ARM- 1 compositions (which contained numerous simulated fission products) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a research program {{to develop and}} evaluate a new high temperature, self-lubricating powder metallurgy composite, PM 212. PM 212 has the same composition as the plasma-sprayed coating, PS 212, which contains 70 wt percent metal-bonded chromium carbide, 15 wt percent silver and 15 wt percent barium fluoride/calcium fluoride eutectic. The carbide acts as a wear <b>resistant</b> <b>matrix</b> and the silver and fluorides act as low and high temperature lubricants, respectively. The material is prepared by sequential cold press, cold isostatic pressing and sintering techniques. In this study, hemispherically tipped wear pins of PM 212 were prepared and slid against superalloy disks at temperatures from 25 to 850 C in air in a pin-on-disk tribometer. Friction coefficients range from 0. 29 to 0. 38 and the wear of both the composite pins and superalloy disks was moderate to low in the 10 (exp - 5) to 10 (exp - 6) cubic mm/N-m range. Preliminary tests indicate that the material has a compressive strength of at least 130 MPa over the entire temperature range of 25 to 900 C. This material has promise for use as seal inserts, bushings, small inside diameter parts and other applications where plasma-sprayed coatings are impractical or too costly...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} an integrated micromechanical model-finite element framework for analyzing coupled heat conduction and deformations of particle-reinforced composite structures. A simplified micromechanical model consisting of four sub-cells, i. e., one particle and three matrix sub-cells is formulated {{to obtain the}} effective thermomechanical properties and micro-macro field variables due to coupled heat conduction and nonlinear thermoviscoelastic deformation of a particulate composite {{that takes into account}} the dissipation of energy from the viscoelastic constituents. A time integration algorithm for simultaneously solving the equations that govern heat conduction and thermoviscoelastic deformations of isotropic homogeneous materials is developed. The algorithm is then integrated to the proposed micromechanical model. A significant temperature generation due to the dissipation effect in the viscoelastic matrix was observed when the composite body is subjected to cyclic mechanical loadings. Heat conduction due to the dissipation of the energy cannot be ignored in predicting the factual temperature and deformation fields within the composite structure, subjected to cyclic loading for a long period. A higher creep <b>resistant</b> <b>matrix</b> material or adding elastic particles can lower the temperature generation. Our analyses suggest that using particulate composites and functionally graded materials can reduce the heat generation due to energy dissipation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Using both {{conventional}} fluorescence and confocal {{laser scanning}} microscopy we have investigated whether or not stabilization of isolated human erythroleukemic nuclei with sodium tetrathionate can maintain in the nuclear matrix the same spatial distribution of three polypeptides (M(r) 160 kDa and 125 kDa, previously shown to be components of the internal nuclear matrix plus the 180 -kDa nucleolar isoform of DNA topoisomerase II) as seen in permeabilized cells. The incubation of isolated nuclei {{in the presence of}} 2 mM sodium tetrathionate was performed at 0 degrees C or 37 degrees C. The matrix fraction retained 20 - 40 % of nuclear protein, depending on the temperature at which the chemical stabilization was executed. Western blot analysis revealed that the proteins studied were completely retained in the high-salt <b>resistant</b> <b>matrix.</b> Indirect immunofluorescence experiments showed that the distribution of the three antigens in the final matrix closely resembled that detected in permeabilized cells, particularly when the stabilization was performed at 37 degrees C. This conclusion was also strengthened by analysis of cells, isolated nuclei and the nuclear matrix by means of confocal {{laser scanning microscopy}}. We conclude that sodium tetrathionate stabilization of isolated nuclei does not alter the spatial distribution of some nuclear matrix proteins...|$|R
40|$|The present {{paper is}} devoted to the diffusional growth of spherical {{precipitates}} having a volumetric misfit. Thus, the matrix exerts a confining pressure on the growing precipitate retarding its growth. Elastic deformation, creep and diffusion are assumed as mechanisms accommodating the misfit of the precipitate in the matrix. Based on the Thermodynamic Extremal Principle, evolution equations for the state variables (e. g. precipitate radius, chemical composition of the precipitate) are derived. The solution of these evolution equations is compared with a number of limiting cases treated in closed analytic form. Results are worked out for model parameters similar to those of a steel with 0. 5 % C and 2 % Cr. The most important result is the evolution of the precipitate radius and its dependence on the creep strength of the matrix. If the material creeps readily, the growth rate is controlled by rapid diffusion of interstitial atoms and is, therefore, high. For a creep <b>resistant</b> <b>matrix,</b> the excess volume of the growing precipitate must be accommodated by the slow diffusion of substitutional atoms away from the precipitate. The precipitate grows correspondingly slower, in the present case by four orders of magnitude. Further results are shown for the confining pressure on the precipitate and for chemical variables...|$|R
