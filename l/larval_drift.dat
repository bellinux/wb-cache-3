Hilsa species and other non-identified fish species were found throughout the monsoon season. The highest larval fish densities were found in the upper strata of the river, near the shore. Drift densities for these fishes were temporally homogeneous within days. Water turbidity probably influenced vertical and horizontal distribution patterns and the absence of diel distribution patterns. The results were used for the design and construction of a major regulator for the water management of Lohajang River and its surrounding floodplains. The regulator consisted of three main vents for water regulation and two side vents for passages of drifting fish larvae. In 1998 / 99 the impact of the regulator on drifting larvae was measured indicating a mortality rate of 10 % for larvae passing through the fish gates and mortality rates of 11. 8 % and 44 % for larvae passing through the main gates if operated in respectively overshot and undershot mode. This impact is discussed in relation to declining yields of riverine fish and the construction of fish passes in the floodplains of Bangladesh and it was concluded that improvement of existing regulators to wards operating in overshot mode could be more cost effective then the construction of new fish passes.

We sampled juvenile and adult fish in 15 tributaries in both the summer and fall of 1995 and attempted to relate the densities of the most abundant species to physical variables.

Of these groups, only age- 0 steelhead were most abundant in cool tributaries.

50|$|Saugers {{generally}} move upstream {{to spawn}} during March-May {{depending on where}} their home locations are. They move downstream to their home locations from April-July after their spawning period is over. Saugers {{have been known to}} travel between 10 and 600 km from their home to spawning location downstream. Habitat at spawning sites are less complex and diverse than home locations. Females prefer rocky substrate and pools to deposit their eggs. As females increase in length, egg quality and fecundity increase. However, it is thought that egg production begins to decline after age 6 in female sauger. Sexual maturity is reached between 2 and 5 years old. Other measures of sexual maturity are related to size. A sauger is considered to be an adult when it reaches 250-300 mm. Upon birth, <b>larval</b> saugers <b>drift</b> downstream before developing feeding tendencies and horizontal maneuverability.

50|$|The {{introduction}} of both dreissenid species into the Great Lakes {{appears to be}} the result of ballast water discharge from transoceanic ships that were carrying veligers, juveniles, or adult mussels. The genus Dreissena is highly polymorphic and prolific with high potential for rapid adaptation attributing to its rapid expansion and colonization. Still, there are other factors that can aid in the spread of these species across North American waters, such as, <b>larval</b> <b>drift</b> in river systems or fishing and boating activities that allow for overland transport or movement between water basins.

50|$|Like other Macrobrachium species, the Ohio shrimp is amphidromous. The larvae {{must live}} in {{saltwater}} {{and move to}} fresh water as adults. This is accomplished by having the larvae drift, free-floating, down the river until they reach water where the salinity is high enough to support them. Females carrying eggs may also migrate downstream before releasing the larvae to reduce the time required for travel.

40|$|International audienceThe {{migration}} {{duration of}} European eel (Anguilla anguilla) larvae (leptocephali) from the spawning {{areas in the}} Sargasso Sea to the European continental shelf remains highly controversial, with estimates varying from 6 months to more than 2 yr. We estimated the fastest migration period and the shortest distance travelled by eel larvae by simulating Lagrangian particles released in the Sargasso Sea and by simulating a range of <b>larval</b> behaviours (fixed-depth <b>drift,</b> vertical diurnal migration and active-depth selection to maximize current velocity). This enabled us to compute (i) a passive drift speed, and (ii) a hypothetic swimming speed needed for European eel larvae to cross the Atlantic in 6 months (i. e., the migration duration estimated from otolith daily growth increments). Our {{results show that the}} minimum travel time for an eel larva that is passively drifting was 10 months and 3 days. Active behaviours (vertical diurnal migration and rheotaxis) paradoxically increased the migration period. We found that for leptocephali to cross the Atlantic Ocean in 6 months, they would need to swim a minimum of 3. 4 body lengths per second for 8200 km. No larvae have been observed with such swimming capabilities. These results provide evidence that leptocephali cannot cross the Atlantic in 6 months...|$|R

To assess the risk of impingement and the patterns of movement by emigrating river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis transformers and <b>drifting</b> <b>larval</b> ammocoetes at the site of an Archimedes screw turbine in north-east England, drift nets were set over the periods of January to June 2009 and November 2009 to May 2010.

Night-time catches were 24 - and 8 -fold higher for transformers and larvae, respectively, than daytime catches. Catch per unit water volume data in different channel areas suggest that lamprey larvae behaved as passive particles within the river flow but that transformers selected areas of higher flow. Damage rates of lampreys passed through the screw were low (1. 5 %), suggesting minor impacts on downstream-moving larval and juvenile lampreys.

Exact compensation means that, on average, the net movement of individuals from birth {{to the time of}} reproduction is zero. At the population level, we show that, in general, upstream biased dispersal is not necessary for persistence, unless the reproductive rate is very low. Under all conditions, however, populations of exact compensators attain highest sizes or persistence times, respectively. Although selection pressure towards exact compensation is arguably very general in populations subject to stream drift, trade-offs or constraints might change the outcome of selection.

Genetic studies {{to determine if there}} were different stocks along the coast were inconclusive. Early <b>larval</b> stages (zoeae) <b>drifted</b> progressively offshore as they developed. The last stage larvae (megalopae) were found in nearshore waters. San Francisco Bay was determined to be an important nursery ground for juvenile crabs which contribute substantially to the local coastal adult stock. Many species of fish were found to prey upon larval and juvenile crabs. Silver salmon preyed heavily upon megalopae. Chlorine-treated sewage wastes slowed responses of juvenile crabs but present waste treatment practices (dechlorination before discharge) apparently are not harmful. No harmful effects of other pollutants (trace elements, pesticides, PCB's, and oil) were detected at levels which were found in crab tissues and the Bay environment. A long-term oceanographic change, characterized by increased ocean temperatures and stronger northward-flowing winter currents was found to coincide with the crab decline. These conditions appear to have biological effects on crabs. San Francisco crabs were found, on the average, to have smaller ovaries than Eureka crabs. In the laboratory, crab egg mortality was greater in increased seawater temperatures. Overall conclusions are that the primary factors responsible for the crab decline are long-term changes in ocean conditions which have affected egg production and survival, and distribution of larvae.

The Laurentian Great Lakes have several introduced and native adfluvial fish, where only a few studies have investigated the impacts of their migration on energy budgets in Michigan coastal streams. We quantified the contribution of energy from Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) muscle and eggs, steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) eggs, and larval white suckers (Catostomus commersonii) to coastal stream energy budgets. Energy densities and energy delivered to streams were estimated using bomb calorimetry and annual return data from the Little Manistee River Weir and other recent studies. In addition, we compared the energy contribution of these adfluvial fish tissues and aquatic insects to resident stream fish diets in two rivers in western Michigan. Specifically, we examined the energy contribution of Chinook eggs to steelhead parr diets in Bigelow Creek, MI and the contribution of energy by larval white suckers to brown trout (Salmo trutta) and non-migratory rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) diets in the Big Manistee River, MI. Our measured energy density values differed markedly from values typically used in the literature, and indicate that some invertebrate groups (Trichoptera) have energy densities that do not significantly differ from salmon eggs which are typically perceived to be energy dense. Our results suggest that steelhead parr in Bigelow Creek consume more energy during the fall when salmon eggs are present. In contrast, large numbers of <b>drifting</b> <b>larval</b> white suckers in the Big Manistee River does not result in an increase in energy intake for trout during spring, but may satisfy base energy needs.

40|$|In macrobenthos with meroplanktonic larvae, larval {{settlement}} and recruitment are two crucial processes for population cohort formation, yet {{only a few}} studies have given explicit definitions for newly settled and recruited juveniles (settlers and recruits) and descriptions of those processes with relevant time scales. Using a comprehensive approach, our study demonstrated a clear pattern in cohort formation of the trochid gastropod population (Umbonium moniliferum) on an intertidal sandflat, southwestern Japan, in the breeding seasons of 2002 and 2007 - 2009. The study included (1) daily monitoring for spawned eggs and competent larvae in the field and the laboratory, (2) daily and fortnightly monitoring for juveniles, and (3) collection of larvae in the water column and in situ simulation of <b>larval</b> retention, releasing <b>drift</b> cards within an embayment embracing the sandflat. The population with shell widths of 5 - 14 mm occupied the lower shore in densities of about 1000 inds. m- 2, spawning gametes for lecithotrophic larval development with the shortest duration of 3 d during late September through October. The settlers occurring per day and the newly recruited cohort in the size-frequency distribution were defined as juveniles belonging to the smallest size class (0. 20 and 0. 21 mm) and to the most left-hand normal-distribution group, respectively. The growth rate was estimated at 0. 02 mm d- 1. A synchronous mass egg spawning took place 2 - 4 d after neap tide, followed by the sequential occurrence of veligers and settlers in high densities, which was completed by the next neap tide, leading to the formation of one newly recruited cohort. Three distinct cohorts were produced consecutively, most probably due to this semilunar cycle. The iteroparous spawning was supposedly performed by the same females. By the following spring, the three cohorts had fused into a single young-of-the-year cohort. Veligers were present across all depth layers in the water column down to 20 m, with a quarter being present within the surface 1 m. Drift cards were driven ashore, with cumulative retrieval rates of 50 and 70 % 3 and 9 d after release, respectively, suggesting that hydrodynamics allowed good retention of larvae in the water surface. Using an exponentially decreasing function describing competent larval numbers in a 2 to 9 -d period after fertilization in the laboratory, the degree of self-recruitment in the population was assessed under the assumption of complete retention and no mortality of larvae due to predation. The results suggested the presence of some allochthonous subsidy...|$|R
