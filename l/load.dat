5|$|John Kadlec of Beta Engineering {{originally}} planned {{the use of}} 8-inch HCS, which he specified could withstand 120 pounds per square foot, a <b>load</b> which exceeded specifications on all 8-inch HCS. During the bidding process, the owners were advised by a bidder, Precon, that the specified <b>load</b> could not be handled by the HCS without reinforcements from a composite concrete topping. However, Kadlec advised the owners that the plans called for 8-inch HCS which could withstand the <b>load</b> without reinforcement from topping. The contract was thus awarded to Coreslab, despite Coreslab's design tables indicating that the specified project loads were 38% higher than the maximum <b>load.</b> In 1992, over {{a decade after the}} mall's construction, Coreslab retracted the claim to be able to support the <b>load</b> without the use of a composite topping.|$|E
5000|$|For aircraft, <b>loading</b> {{is divided}} into two major categories: limit <b>loads</b> and {{ultimate}} <b>loads.</b> Limit <b>loads</b> are the maximum <b>loads</b> a component or structure may carry safely. Ultimate <b>loads</b> are the limit <b>loads</b> times a factor of 1.5 or the point beyond which the component or structure will fail. Gust <b>loads</b> are determined statistically and are provided by an agency such as the Federal Aviation Administration. Crash <b>loads</b> are loosely bounded by the ability of structures to survive the deceleration of a major ground [...] Other <b>loads</b> that may be critical are pressure <b>loads</b> (for pressurized, high-altitude aircraft) and ground <b>loads.</b> <b>Loads</b> on the ground can be from adverse braking or maneuvering during taxiing. Aircraft are constantly subjected to cyclic <b>loading.</b> These cyclic <b>loads</b> can cause metal fatigue.|$|R

5|$|Several {{recent studies}} have shown that adding seductive details does not have a {{significant}} impact on learner outcomes. Park et al. (2011) looked at cognitive <b>load</b> theory to explain these controversial results. The experiment asked high school students to learn about biology using a multimedia environment (one with seductive details and one without). The experiment also varied the cognitive <b>load</b> for the students. The results showed that students performed significantly higher when seductive details were present in a low cognitive <b>load</b> environment as compared with all other conditions. Another study by Park et al. (2015) showed that while seductive details were detrimental to learning in high cognitive <b>load</b> text conditions, seductive details actually improved motivation and learning outcomes in narration conditions where the cognitive <b>load</b> was low. This means that slideshows or webcasts with well-prepared narration that use motivating bits of information increase learner motivation.|$|E

5|$|While {{harmonics}} in the PWM output {{can easily}} be filtered by carrier-frequency-related filter inductance to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor <b>load,</b> the VFD's diode-bridge rectifier converts AC line voltage to DC voltage output by super-imposing non-linear half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion, and hence voltage distortion, of the AC line input. When the VFD loads are relatively small {{in comparison to the}} large, stiff power system available from the electric power company, the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of the AC grid can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in low-voltage networks, harmonics caused by single-phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase. However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear <b>load</b> compared to total <b>load</b> or of non-linear <b>load</b> compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the <b>load</b> can {{have a negative impact on}} the AC power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.|$|E
25|$|Bed <b>load</b> {{moves by}} rolling, sliding, and hopping (or saltating) over the bed, and moves {{at a small}} {{fraction}} of the fluid flow velocity. Bed <b>load</b> is generally thought to constitute 5-10% of the total sediment <b>load</b> in a stream, making it less important in terms of mass balance. However, the bed material <b>load</b> (the bed <b>load</b> plus the portion of the suspended <b>load</b> which comprises material derived from the bed) is often dominated by bed <b>load,</b> especially in gravel-bed rivers. This bed material <b>load</b> is the only part of the sediment <b>load</b> that actively interacts with the bed.

30|$|Kawashima et al. (2006) {{studied the}} effect of {{bilateral}} excitation on the seismic performance of RC bridge columns with 1.35 m tall and 400 Ã— 400 mm cross-section, using cyclic and hybrid <b>loading</b> tests. In the cyclic <b>loading</b> test, the columns were <b>loaded</b> unilaterally or bilaterally using diagonal, square, circular and elliptic displacement paths. For the hybrid <b>loading</b> cases, the ground accelerations of the Kobe and Northridge earthquakes were used. In the cyclic tests, the <b>loading</b> and unloading hysteresis curves are round near the peak displacements under the bilateral <b>loading,</b> which results from the interaction of restoring forces in two directions. Only the hysteresis at the first excursions, in each <b>loading</b> step, has a feature similar to that under the unilateral <b>loading.</b> This is because, under the circular-path <b>loading,</b> the column was first <b>loaded</b> only in the N direction in the first excursions at each <b>loading</b> step. Comparing {{to the strength of}} the column under bilateral hybrid <b>loading,</b> the strength of the column under bilateral cyclic <b>loading</b> is 14 % to 23 % and 15 % to 35 % smaller in NS and EW directions, respectively. Furthermore, the deterioration of the lateral restoring force is significant after 3 % of drift, while deterioration did not occur until 6.3 % peak drift under the bilateral hybrid <b>loading.</b> Flexural strength and ductility capacity of RC bridge columns with a square section significantly deteriorate under the bilateral excitation in comparison with unilateral excitation in both cyclic and hybrid <b>loading</b> tests. Failure of the columns under the cyclic <b>loading</b> test, for which the <b>loading</b> displacement was increased stepwise with three <b>loading</b> excursions at each <b>loading</b> step, is more extensive than the failure developed in the hybrid <b>loading</b> test. In fact, <b>loading</b> protocol is important, {{and it has to be}} carefully determined in the cyclic <b>loading</b> tests.|$|R
