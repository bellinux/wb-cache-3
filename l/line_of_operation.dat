5000|$|A logical <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> (LLO) is an {{obsolete}} American military doctrinal concept. It {{was originally}} used {{along with the}} separate term <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> which described a geographic line from a base of operations to a military objective. The qualifier [...] "logical" [...] indicated the pursuit of military objectives that did not necessarily require a physical or geographic description, such as governance capacity-building and development activities.|$|E

"Train the Force" [...] is JIDO's third <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> The Joint Center of Excellence (JCOE), {{established}} in April 2006, is JIDO's lead {{organization for the}} train-the-force <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> and is responsible for developing the training that enables this. Led by JIEDDO's deputy director of training and located at the Army's National Training Center, Fort Irwin, California, JCOE provided support to joint and service institutions and assists with developing counter-IED doctrine and tactics, techniques, and procedures. It has {{contributed significantly to the}} institutionalization of combat-proven counter-IED training.|$|E
50|$|The {{possession}} of Avesnes, gained too {{with so little}} sacrifice of life, and with none of time, was of essential importance to the Prussians; offering as it did a secure depot for their material and supplies upon their new <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> It also served for the reception of their sick, and all who had been rendered incapable of {{keeping up with the}} army.|$|E
50|$|No {{particular}} direction was prescribed, because Napoleon {{was totally}} {{ignorant of the}} real line of the Prussian retreat At {{the same time he}} was strongly impressed with the idea that Blücher had retired upon Namur and Liege, with a view to occupy the line of the Meuse, whence he might seriously endanger {{the right wing of the}} French Army, as also its main <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> should it advance uponBrussels.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{traditional}} sense, a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> is [...] "an imaginary {{line between the}} force's base <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> and the objective". In contrast, a logical <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> {{is one in which}} [...] "positional reference to enemy forces has little relevance". In essence, an LLO was a strategy or a series of steps to address a problem, either military or non-military, within the context <b>of</b> counterinsurgency <b>operations,</b> stability operations, or other operations not focused on major combat operations. Such problems included traditional military objectives such as providing security or training host-nation security forces, or unconventional tasks such as providing social services, economic development, or governance capacity-building.|$|R

The direction of the attack was perpendicular to the right flank of the French Army; and consequently, also, to the Charleroi road, which constituted the French main <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Train the Force, one {{of three}} {{mutually}} supporting lines of operation, is {{a critical component of}} the JIEDDO mission to defeat the IED threat as a weapon of strategic influence. The Joint Center of Excellence is JIEDDO's lead organization for the train-the-force <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> and is responsible for development of training capabilities that enable the services' and combatant commanders' mission of preparing U.S. forces to defeat this threat.|$|E
50|$|The PRT’s {{civil affairs}} <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> exerted {{a large amount}} of public diplomacy. CA {{operations}} were responsible, along with the provincial government, for implementation and supervision of projects in the province. These projects included public affairs like humanitarian supply distribution, like school and medical supplies. Civil affairs operations were responsible for reaching out to the population to determine what is needed to make society stable and secure from the insurgent ideology. To do this they had {{to get to know the}} environment, including the people, places, and culture of their section of the province.|$|E

It's rapid acquisition ability makes the agency unique. JIDO can develop a solution and have it making a positive effect on the battlefield in as little as three to four months—75% faster than the regular acquisition process. It streamlines decisions and resource allocation by consolidating the Department of Defense's three major decision-making processes (acquisition, future requirements, and financial management) under one authority. Flexible funding authorities provided by the U.S. Congress also helps.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "logical <b>line</b> <b>of</b> operation" [...] was {{rescinded}} in US Army doctrine by FM 3-0: Operations. It {{was replaced}} by the term <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> Effort. The change makes <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> which are now strictly geographic designations, distinct from the conceptual <b>line</b> <b>of</b> effort, which [...] "links multiple tasks and missions using the logic of purpose—cause and effect—to focus efforts toward establishing operational and strategic conditions." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{required}} {{space for}} hotels, flats and secondary residences {{has increased the}} amount of space occupied by roads and buildings. While {{a large amount of}} people requires special water, sewage and electricity systems, a great deal of construction work is needed. Access roads and the treatment of salt are responsible for high amounts of erosion at ski resorts. In some cases natural lakes must be tapped or reservoirs built to cater for the population demand. The urbanization of mountainous areas have increased the space of impervious surface, and prevents the natural flow of water into the ground. Resulting in a disturbed water table and potential cause of erosion in undesired places. Lastly, when building ski lifts, its <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> must be shaped and drained, and large concrete blocks must be set down for pylons. If the pylons are not carefully placed, it could cause damage to surface vegetation.|$|E
50|$|The {{circumstances}} under which the French army, generally, was placed on 19 June rendered it sufficiently obvious that Grouchy would be compelled to effect his retreat by Namur; and further, that whatever show of resistance he might offer on that point would be solely intended to gain time {{for the security of}} his troops whilst retiring, in one column only, by the long and narrow defile of the river Meuse which leads to Dinant. Aware that Napoleon's defeated army was retiring along the direct <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> the Charleroi road; he immediately saw the imminent risk of his own retreat becoming intercepted, and the consequent necessity of his effecting the latter in a parallel direction, with a view to his rejoining the main army as soon as practicable. To retire, therefore, by Geinbloux upon Namur, and thence along the line of the Meuse, by Dinant and Givet. In the view of Slbourn this naturally presented itself as the true and proper course to be pursued.|$|E
5000|$|... "There {{must be a}} {{fundamental}} change of culture in how ISAF approaches operations. StratCom {{should not be a}} separate <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operation,</b> but rather an integral and fully embedded part of policy development, planning processes, and the execution of operations. Analyzing and maximizing StratCom effects must be central to the formulation of schemes of maneuver and during the execution of operations. In order to affect this paradigm shift, ISAF HQ must synchronize all stratCom stakeholders. Implicit in this change of culture is the clear recognition that modern strategic communication is about credible dialogue, not a monologue where we design our systems and resources to deliver messages to target audiences in the most effective manner. This is now a population centric campaign and no effort should be spared to ensure that the Afghan people are part of the conversation. Receiving, understanding, and amending behavior as a result of messages received from audiences can be an effective method of gaining genuine trust and credibility. This would improve the likelihood of the population accepting ISAF messages and changing their behavior as a result." ...|$|E

40|$|A {{model is}} {{provided}} to capture capacity phenomena in passenger traffic assignment to a transit network. These {{pertain to the}} interaction of passenger traffic and vehicle traffic: vehicle seat capacity drives the internal comfort, vehicle total capacity determines internal comfort and also platform waiting, passenger flows at vehicle egress and access interplay with dwell time, dwell time drives track occupancy and in turn the period frequency of any service that passes the station along the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations,</b> and then service frequency influences service capacity and platform waiting. These phenomena are dealt with by <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> {{on the basis of}} a set of local models yielding specific flows or costs. The topological order <b>of</b> the <b>line</b> is used to devise two <b>line</b> models <b>of,</b> respectively, flow loading and cost setting, each of which calls its local sub-models. The pair <b>of</b> <b>line</b> algorithms amounts to a complex cost-flow relationship at the level <b>of</b> the <b>line.</b> The line model is used as a sub-model in passenger assignment to network hyperpaths, where <b>line</b> pairs <b>of</b> access-egress stations constitute leg links. The properties of static traffic equilibrium for both vehicles and passengers are established...|$|R

40|$|The latest global {{financial}} crisis has highlighted {{the need for}} financial services firms to adopt comprehensive risk management techniques to identify, manage and mitigate risks promptly and efficiently. To this end, a key risk management tool is to hold sufficient capital to back the risks a business is running. In recent times, financial services regulators have also initiated a move towards risk-based economic capital approach with different regulations for banks (Basel 2 and 3) and insurance firms (Solvency 2). In this paper, a generic definition of economic capital is proposed using a stochastic approach, which is then used to quantify economic capital for a capital repayment mortgage, a lifetime mortgage, a life insurance annuity and a conglomerate operating a range of financial services. The paper highlights economic capital as a risk management tool that unifies capital calculation techniques across all financial services firms and conglomerates, irrespective of their <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation...</b>|$|E
