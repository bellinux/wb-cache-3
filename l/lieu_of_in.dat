Additionally, it is also difficult to compare with previous studies, especially since the majority have been done on mice, and there are different processes between species.|$|E
40|$|Trees within Nacogdoches, Texas were {{measured}} for height using Pictometry hyperspatial imagery at 4 inch spatial resolution. Trees measured included baldcypress located on LaNana Creek {{as part of}} a hybrid analysis study. Baldcypress, Taxodiumdistichum, was planted along La Nana Creek, Nacogdoches, Texas, for erosion control and as a test bank for growth of the species genotypes. Each tree was located with GPS and entered into the GIS data base in the Arthur Temple College of Forestry and Agriculture, Stephen F. Austin State University. Actual tree height, measured using a height pole in 0. 1 inch increments, was compared to tree height measured onscreen using Pictometry hyperspatial 4 inch spatial digital imagery. Remotely sensed tree height using Pictometry digital imagery was within 2. 5 percent of actual height. Results indicate that hyperspatial digital imagery is an effective and cost effective method to measure tree height in <b>lieu</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> situ measurements...|$|E

In <b>lieu</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> situ current measure-ments with adequate spatial and temporal resolution, the mean current structure used in the model {{was obtained from the}} Parallel Ocean Climate Model (POCM). The TIWs in the linear model have cross-equatorial structure and wavenumber–frequency content similar to the TIWs in POCM, even when the vertical structures of the state variables are projected onto only the first two orthogonal baroclinic eigen-vectors. Because this model is able to reproduce TIWs with relatively simple vertical structure, it is possible to examine the mechanism for the formation of TIWs. TIWs are shown to form from a resonance between two equatorial Rossby waves as the strength of the background currents is slowly increased. 1...|$|E

40|$|Inference {{mechanisms}} about spatial relations {{constitute an}} important aspect of spatial reasoning as they allow users to derive unknown spatial information from a set of known spatial relations. When formalized in the form of algebras, spatial-relation inferences represent a mathematically sound definition of the behavior of spatial relations, which can be used to specify constraints in spatial query languages. Current spatial query languages utilize spatial concepts that are derived primarily from geometric principles, which do not necessarily match with the concepts people use when they reason and communicate about spatial relations. This paper presents an alternative approach to spatial reasoning by starting with a small set of spatial operators that are derived from concepts closely related to human cognition. This cognitive foundation comes from the behavior of image schemata, which are cognitive structures for organizing people's experiences and comprehension. From the operations and spatial relations of a small-scale space, a container-surface algebra is defined with nine basic spatial operators [...] -inside, outside, on, off, their respective converse relationscontains, excludes, supports, separated_from, and the identity relation equal. The container-surface algebra was applied to spaces with objects of different sizes and its inferences were assessed through human-subject experiments. Discrepancies between the container-surface algebra and the human-subject testing appear for combinations of spatial relations that result in more than one possible inference depending on the relative size of objects. For configurations with small-scale and large-scale objects larger discrepancies were found because people use relations such as part of and at in <b>lieu</b> <b>of</b> <b>in.</b> Basic conc [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Basin {{development}} and consequent change in basin land cover have been {{often associated with}} an increased turbidity in coastal waters because of sediment yield and nutrients loading. The later leads to phytoplankton abundance further exacerbating water turbidity. This subsequently affects biological and physical processes in coastal estuaries by interfering with sun light penetration to coral reefs and sea grass, and even affecting public health. Therefore, consistent estimation of land cover changes and turbidity trend lines is crucial to design environmental and restoration management plans, to predict fate of possible pollutants, and to estimate sedimentary fluxes into the ocean. Ground solely methods to estimate land cover change would be unpractical and traditional methods of monitoring in situ water turbidity can be very expensive and time consuming. Accurate monitoring on the status and trends of basin land cover as well as the water quality of the receiving water bodies are required for analysis of relationships between the two variables. Use of remote sensing (RS) technology provides a great benefit for both fields of study, facilitating monitoring of changes in a timely and cost effective manner and covering wide areas with long term measurements. In this study, the Magdalena River basin and fixed geographical locations in the estuarine waters of its delta are used as a case to study the temporal trend lines of both, land cover change and the reflectance of the water turbidity using satellite technology. Land cover data from a combined product between sensors Terra and Aqua (MCD 12 Q 1) from MODIS will be adapted to the conditions in the Magdalena basin to estimate changes in land cover since year 2000 to 2009. Surface reflectance data from a MODIS, Terra (MOD 09 GQ), band 1, will be used in <b>lieu</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> situ water turbidity for the time period between 2000 and present.

40|$|Diabetes in rats {{inhibits}} {{the migration}} of neutrophils into the healing gingival crevice, an effect associated with impaired in vitro neutrophil chemotactic activity. We recently described the in vivo response of human and rat crevicular neutrophils to a chemotactic challenge and used this assay {{in the present study}} on streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Optimal concentrations of two chemotactic agents, casein (0. 2 μl, 2 mg/ml) or N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (0. 2 μl, 10 − 4 M), were placed into the gingival crevices of control and diabetic rats (time zero) after the resting neutrophil count was measured. After a 15 -min delay, the neutrophil counts and gingival crevicular fluid flow were assessed every 5 min for another 0. 5 h. The control rats (n = 14) showed an increase in neutrophil counts which reached maximum levels 30 min after the N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine challenge (“peak” neutrophil response) and decreased dramatically 5 min later. Diabetes of 4 days (n = 4), 14 days (n = 8), and 20 days (n = 5) duration reduced the peak neutrophil response 45, 66, and 71 %, respectively. Casein produced the same response as N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine in control rats. Uncontrolled diabetes of 20 days duration reduced the peak neutrophil response to casein by 83 %; diabetics administered insulin on a daily basis showed a reduction of only 34 %. The pattern of change in gingival crevicular fluid flow in response to chemoattractants paralleled the neutrophil response. The chemotactic activity of peritoneal neutrophils was assessed in vitro with the agarose gel technique and was found to be correlated (r = 0. 84; P < 0. 01) with the in vivo chemotactic response in the same rats. If the same in vivo defect is observed in humans with diabetes (or with other systemic diseases associated with leukocyte dysfunction), this test could be useful diagnostically to rapidly assess neutrophil chemotaxis in <b>lieu</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> vitro assays and to identify patients who are unusually susceptible to aggressive periodontal disease...|$|E

40|$|The {{first part}} of this {{research}} focused on wide-cross whole-genome radiation hybrid (WWRH) mapping of the cotton (Gossypium) genome. Radiation hybrid mapping has been used extensively to map the genomes of human and certain animal species, but not plant species. In <b>lieu</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> vitro hybrid cell line technologies for plants, we developed a novel approach for radiation hybrid mapping based on wide-cross in vivo hybridization. Flowers from one species of cotton, either G. hirsutum or G. barbadense, were &# 61543;-irradiated and then used to pollinate the other species. The resulting hybrid plants were assessed as a mapping tool. Two WWRH mapping panels were constructed from 5 - and 8 -krad &# 61543;-irradiation treatments. Both panels demonstrated that the WWRH mapping method can be used to map the cotton genome, and that this method complements traditional linkage mapping approaches. The second part of this research focused on the identification of cold-responsive genes using spotted oligo-gene microarray analysis. Increased cold-tolerance in cotton would promote early and uniform seedling establishment, expand the growing season, decrease susceptibility to fungal infections and certain diseases, and increase fiber yield and quality. BLAST searches of the cotton database using amino acid sequences of 93 drought/cold-related genes from Arabidopsis and several other plant species led to 806 cotton orthologous cDNAs and expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Eight hundred and six cotton 70 -mer oligos were designed and included in an oligo-gene microarray containing 1, 536 70 -mer oligos, each representing a cDNA or EST from cotton, or one of 121 chloroplast genes or 66 mitochondrial genes from Arabidopsis. Thirty-eight cotton cDNAs and ESTs were identified as cold-responsive genes based on experimental treatment and oligo-gene microarray analysis. Expression was up-regulated for 36 genes and down-regulated for two genes by cold treatment. Results from microarray analysis were tested and confirmed by northern blot analysis for 16 genes. Our data suggest that Arabidopsis orthologous genes can be used to identify homologous cotton genes. The oligo-gene microarray is a valid approach to study transcriptional changes in cotton...|$|E
40|$|In vitro {{studies of}} drug {{permeability}} are traditionally carried out using cultured monolayers of epithelial cell lines grown on semi permeable membranes. Caco- 2 cells, which are colon-derived, spontaneously form polarised cell layers when cultured in vitro which are akin to an epithelium of enterocyte-like cells. The Caco- 2 {{model has been}} developed as a powerful in vitro tool in the early assessment of human drug permeability and is even approved by regulatory agencies for biowaver applications (i. e. in vitro tests in <b>lieu</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> vivo animal experiments). As Caco- 2 cells are derived from colon tissue they represent a more formidable barrier to drug absorption than the upper regions of the intestine {{which is where the}} majority of oral drugs permeate into the body. Whilst the Caco- 2 model, alongside other in vitro methods, has provided a significant means to understand the mechanics of drug permeability. Many researchers have sought to improve upon the existing unicellular model; it is hoped that this will result in a more relevant and predictive model for researchers to test new drugs but also to dissect cellular cross talk and to probe cell-matrix interactions. Myofibroblasts are a niche cell type located subjacent to epithelial tissues which regulate the integrity, growth and differentiation of the overlying epithelium. In this study the co-culture of human epithelial cell lines with a myofibroblast cell line, CCD- 18 co, were investigated to study how myofibroblasts influence the barrier integrity of epithelia in vivo. Additionally, nanofibre scaffolds produced by electrospinning were explored as 3 -dimensional and topographically relevant cell scaffolds to support the growth of intestinal cells in vitro. In a traditional transwell format, cultured epithelial lines Caco- 2 (intestinal), HT- 29 (intestinal) and Calu- 3 (airway) in co-cultures with CCD- 18 co revealed cell-line specific response with respect to the modulation of barrier integrity. The mechanism of the modulation was confirmed to be mediated through paracrine signalling by using myofibroblast conditioned media. Fibre scaffolds which mimic the fibrillar nature of the extra cellular matrix and basement membrane were produced by electrospinning using the polymer, poly (ethylene terephthalate). Nanofibre scaffolds were characterised and further optimised for cell culture with surface coating with collagen to achieve adequate cell attachment and confluence. Work was also conducted to incorporate villi architectures into the fibre scaffolds; the potential of this ambition was investigated by using models produced by rapid prototyping. These models, which demonstrated good fidelity with the actual villi dimensions found in vivo, were used during the electrospinning process to shape the polymer scaffolds towards the geometry found in intestinal tissue. A number of molecular tracers and model drug compounds were used to evaluate the permeability profiles of Caco- 2 monocultures, Caco- 2 /CCD- 18 co co-cultures cultured on the two different culture substrates in addition to the assessment of resected porcine intestinal tissue sections. Caco- 2 cells and Caco- 2 /CCD- 18 co co-cultures grown on nanofibre substrates were found to have lower electrical resistance and higher permeability properties than their transwell equivalents. Caco- 2 /CCD- 18 co co-cultures on conventional transwell inserts demonstrated a permeability profile closer to the resected porcine tissue and reported human tissue values than the conventional Caco- 2 model whilst maintaining p-glycoprotein assay sensitivity. This work forms a solid foundation for further research into the role of myofibroblasts in epithelial cell function and in the development of more predictive in vitro cell models for widespread scientific research...|$|E
