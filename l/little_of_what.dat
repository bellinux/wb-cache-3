The Afghan economy hadn't made any real progress and the Afghan standard of living had not risen. Daoud had also garnered much criticism for his single party constitution in 1977 which alienated him from his political supporters. By this time, the two main factions of the PDPA, previously locked in a power struggle, had reached a fragile agreement for reconciliation. Communist-sympathizing army officials were by then already planning a move against the government. According to Hafizullah Amin, who became Afghan head of state in 1979, the PDPA had started plotting the coup in 1976, two years before it materialized.|$|E
25|$|A basic {{principle}} of Huygens {{is that the}} speed of light is finite, a point which had been the subject of an experimental demonstration by Olaus Roemer (1679 at the Paris Observatory), but which Huygens is presumed to have believed already. The theory is kinematic and its scope largely restricted to geometric optics. It covers <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> would now be termed physical optics. It deals with wave fronts and their normal rays, with propagation conceived by means of spherical waves emitted along the wave front (see also Huygens–Fresnel principle). It was justified as an ether theory, involving transmission via perfectly elastic particles, a revision of the view of Descartes. The nature of light was therefore a longitudinal wave.|$|E

The largest piece, weighing 10,000 tons, (9,071,847kg) was found about three-quarters of a mile (1200m) below the dam site.|$|E

500|$|Further {{criticism}} followed. Tod was {{an officer}} of the British imperial system, at that time the world's dominant power. Working in India, he attracted the attention of local rulers who were keen to tell their own tales of defiance against the Mughal empire. He heard what they told him but knew <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they omitted. He was a soldier writing about a caste renowned for its martial abilities, and he was aided in his writings by the very people whom he was documenting. He had been interested in Rajput history prior to coming into contact with them in an official capacity, as administrator of the region in which they lived. These factors, says Freitag, contribute to why the Annals were [...] "manifestly biased". Freitag argues that critics of Tod's literary output can be split into two groups: those who concentrate on his errors of fact and those who concentrate on his failures of interpretation.|$|E
500|$|Lloyd and Dillon {{returned}} to England in June 1914. [...] Lloyd started a provincial tour of Liverpool, Aldershot, Southend, Birmingham and Margate, {{and finished the}} summer season at the London Hippodrome. She sang [...] "The Coster Honeymoon in Paris" [...] and [...] "Who Paid the Rent for Mrs Rip Van Winkle?", the latter {{of which had been}} received particularly well with her American audiences. [...] Within a fortnight, Britain was at war, which threw the music-hall world into disarray. The atmosphere in London's music halls had turned patriotic, and theatre proprietors often held charity events and benefits to help the war effort. Lloyd played her part and frequently visited hospitals, including the Ulster Volunteer Force Hospital in Belfast, where she interacted with wounded servicemen. [...] She also toured munitions factories to help boost public morale, but received no official recognition for her work. During 1914, she scored a hit with [...] "A <b>Little</b> <b>of</b> <b>What</b> you Fancy", which critics thought captured her life perfectly up until that point. [...] The song is [...] about a middle-aged woman who encourages the younger generation to enjoy themselves, rather than indulging in life's excitement herself. [...] During the rendition, Lloyd depicts a young couple who cuddle and kiss on a railway carriage, while she sits back and recalls memories of her doing the same in years gone by.|$|E

500|$|By 1895, Lloyd's risqué {{songs were}} {{receiving}} frequent criticism from theatre reviewers and influential feminists. As a result, she often experienced resistance from strict theatre censorship which dogged {{the rest of}} her career. The writer and feminist Laura Ormiston Chant, {{who was a member of}} the Social Purity Alliance, disliked the bawdiness of music hall performances, and thought that the venues were attractive to prostitutes. [...] Her campaign persuaded the London County Council to erect large screens around the promenade at the Empire Theatre in Leicester Square, as part of the licensing conditions. The screens were unpopular and protesters, among them the young Winston Churchill, later pulled them down. That November at the Tivoli theatre, Lloyd performed [...] "Johnny Jones", a ditty about a girl who is taught the facts of life by her best male friend. The song, although not lyrically obscene, was considered to be offensive largely because of the manner in which Lloyd sang it, adding winks and gestures, and creating a conspiratorial relationship with her audience. [...] Social reformers cited [...] "Johnny Jones" [...] as being offensive, but less so compared to other songs of the day. Upon the expiry of a music hall's entertainments licence, the Licensing Committee tried to use the lyrical content of music hall songs as evidence against a renewal. As a result, Lloyd was summoned to perform some of her songs in front of a council committee. [...] She sang [...] "Oh! Mr Porter" [...] (composed for her by George Le Brunn), [...] "A <b>Little</b> <b>of</b> <b>What</b> You Fancy" [...] and [...] "She Sits Among the Cabbages and Peas", which she retitled [...] "I Sits Amongst the Cabbages and Leeks" [...] after some protest. The numbers were sung in such a way that the committee had no reason to find anything amiss. Feeling disgruntled at the council's interference, she then rendered Alfred Tennyson's drawing-room ballad [...] "Come into the Garden, Maud" [...] and displayed leers and nudges, to illustrate each innuendo. [...] The committee were left stunned at the performance, but Lloyd argued afterwards that the rudeness was [...] "all in the mind".|$|E

2500|$|For the , the Prince {{was given}} the name Dastan. According to Mechner, he chose the name as he had learned {{it was an old}} Persian name meaning [...] "trickster". Dastan was portrayed by American actor Jake Gyllenhaal. Gyllenhaal said that there were several reasons that he chose to accept the role of the Prince, {{including}} the character's appeal to him, the fact that the film was based on the video game, and he [...] " [...] to do things that people have tried their hand at and haven't succeeded." [...] According to Gyllenhaal, he retrospectively felt he had over-prepared physically for his role as he knew <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it entailed. He trained for five months prior to the beginning of filming in Morocco, and continued to train during the filming period. Despite the original script being written prior to the making of later games in the Sands of Time continuity, Mechner said that the production team for the film incorporated design elements from later games into the Prince's appearance. An element pointed out by staff is the Prince's appearance in the film's opening and climax, which was inspired by the Prince as he appeared in Warrior Within. The character's costumes were designed by Penny Rose. The Prince's most worn outfit, a loose-fitting spiral coat, was designed by her based on a picture from a piece of ancient Persian embroidery. Her costumes also made nods to the costume designs of the video games.|$|E

2500|$|Vidal's claim about a homoerotic subtext is hotly debated. Vidal {{first made}} the claim in an {{interview}} in the 1995 documentary film The Celluloid Closet, and asserted that he persuaded Wyler to direct Stephen Boyd to play the role {{as if he were a}} spurned homosexual lover. Vidal said that he believed that Messala's vindictiveness could only be motivated by the feeling of rejection that a lover would feel, and suggested to Wyler that Stephen Boyd should play the role that way, and that Heston be kept in the dark about the Messala character's motivations. Vidal further claimed that Wyler took his advice. Whether Vidal wrote the scene in question or had the acting conversation with Wyler, and whether Wyler shot what Vidal wrote, remain issues of debate. In 1980, Wallace biographers Robert and Katharine Morsberger said that Vidal's contribution to the script remained unclear. Heston has asserted that Wyler felt Vidal did not solve the problem of motivation, and that Wyler shot <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he wrote or made little contribution to the script. Wyler himself says that he does not remember any conversation about this part of the script or Boyd's acting with Gore Vidal, and that he discarded Vidal's draft in favor of Fry's. Film critic Gary Giddins also dismisses Vidal's claims, concluding that 80 percent of the script had been written [...] "years before" [...] Vidal came aboard the production. However, Jan Herman, one of Wyler's biographers, asserts [...] "there is no reason to doubt" [...] Vidal's claim, and that Wyler's inability to remember the conversation was just part of the director's notorious caginess. There appears to be some contemporary support for Vidal's assertions. [...] Morgan Hudgens, publicity director for the film, wrote to Vidal in late May 1958 about the crucial scene, and implied there was a homosexual context: [...] "...the big cornpone [...] really threw himself into your 'first meeting' scene yesterday. [...] You should have seen those boys embrace!" [...] Film critic F. X. Feeney, in a comparison of script drafts, concludes that Vidal made significant and extensive contributions to the script.|$|E
