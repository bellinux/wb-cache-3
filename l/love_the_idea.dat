The center {{was made possible by}} the donations and effort of Larry Bird and M.L. Carr. Johnson's family, Danny Ainge, Carr, and members of the YMCA and local community were present for the ribbon cutting ceremony.

500|$|The intent for Connor's {{character}} {{was to put}} [...] "Angel in an emotional space." [...] He was meant to give Angel more to live for than just the usual [...] "day to day" [...] living he was experiencing. [...] "Plus, I just <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of this embarrassing effect of a one-night stand,” Joss Whedon explained in his decision to introduce Angel’s son. The {{character was}} given the Irish name Connor, meaning ‘counselor’ or 'helping warrior', to match Angel's Irish ancestry. Three different babies, triplets Connor, Jake, and Trenton Tupen, were chosen to portray Connor so {{that none of them}} had to remain on the set for very long.|$|E

500|$|Lytle {{also noted}} that he was likely to record a new Grandaddy album, stating, [...] "It's {{probably}} going to happen.... If anyone knows anything about Grandaddy, they realise that my [...] music and Grandaddy's music is slightly interchangeable. I think if I were to focus on making a Grandaddy record [...] a full-blown Grandaddy record, and I {{like the idea of}} that. I'd like to give it a shot." [...] In early 2013, Lytle elaborated: [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of making another Grandaddy record, but I wouldn't want it hanging over my head like 'Okay, you made this record, now are you guys going {{to get out there and}} tour in support of it?'... I'm hoping for this dream scenario where I can make Grandaddy records every so often and not have all this messy stuff that goes along with it. I already did that and it's just not appealing to me any more." ...|$|E
500|$|B in the Mix: The Remixes {{received}} little promotion compared to Spears' standards. A promotional extended play (EP) titled Key Cuts from Remixed with several remixes from {{the album was}} released in September 2005. A contest was launched on Spears' paid fan site for those who pre-ordered the album. The winner received a copy of , a bottle of Spears' fragrance Fantasy with an additional lotion and make-up kit, and a personalized autographed picture of Spears. On November 22, 2005, the day the album was released, a release party was held at an unspecified nightclub in Los Angeles, California, organized by Spears' management and the webmaster of the fansite WorldOfBritney.com. It was a limited event to five hundred people, including members of the fansite or her official fan club. Spears commented: [...] "I {{just wanted to say}} that I <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of all my fans getting together to celebrate the release of my new album. I was happy to help! I hope you have a great night out at the club and dance all night long!".|$|E
500|$|Will & Grace creators and {{executive}} producers David Kohan and Max Mutchnick {{were in favor}} of doing a live episode; [...] "We <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a live episode because we get to show the audience of Will & Grace what we've known from day one — we work with the best cast in network television," [...] said Mutchnick. He noted that the live element would allow the writers to make changes in the script right up until the airing of the episode. Kevin Reilly, who at the time served as NBC Entertainment President, said the [...] "challenging live platform launch" [...] for Will & Grace would be a good way for the show to inaugurate its final season. In discussion of the episode, Burrows, the director of all Will & Grace episodes, commented: [...] "This will be like the classic golden era of television that I was weaned on, where the audience sees everything. Directing a live broadcast will be a first for me, and as long as I have been in the business, there are very few firsts." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Make Me Over" [...] was {{inspired}} by the band's love of British rock, while strains of [...] "Learn You Inside Out" [...] were inspired by the Plastic Ono Band. When asked about the song [...] "Learn You Inside Out", Wade said, [...] "I wrote it really quick. We decided just to freestyle. It was one of those moments when we really grew as a band, being able to reach each other and know where we're going." [...] The song [...] "Disarray" [...] {{was inspired}} by Wade's strict and religious family. When asked about the song, he said, [...] "Angels, demons. We all fight them both, and anyone who pretends they don’t is not someone I want to hang out with." [...] "Storm" [...] was originally written by Wade at the age of sixteen, when he was going through difficult times. When asked about the song in an interview, Wade said, [...] "That was fun to record because of its starkness. We <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of the title, surrounded by negative space, like the a cappella beginning. Because when you’re lost in confusion, no matter how much is going on around you, you’re still alone." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{most of the}} film, Berry's character, Turner, the 9-1-1 operator, does {{stay inside}} [...] "the hive" [...] before {{becoming}} {{actively involved in the}} search for Breslin's character, Welson, the kidnapped caller. D'Ovidio chose two female leads, explaining, [...] "I wanted strong women... I think it was appropriate here, since most 911 call operators are women." [...] Berry remarked, [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of being a part of a movie that was so empowering for women. We don't often get to play roles like this, where ordinary people become heroic and do something extraordinary." [...] D'Ovidio chose to tell the story from the perspective of two characters—the operator and the caller—believing that it would become repetitive if it focused on only one. As a result, he switched perspectives every ten pages when writing the screenplay. As well as collaborating on the story with his wife, Nicole and Jon Bokenkamp, he accepted suggestions from Berry, Breslin and Eklund: [...] "Halle came in with some great notes and Abigail and Michael and it started to flesh things out. I'm not one to say 'no' to a great suggested line of dialogue. It just makes me look better as a writer! I feel it's a very collaborative process, and some of the happiest accidents happen when you just listen to people. When someone comes up to you and says, 'Why don't we do it this way?' I think that it's important to listen." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge" [...] {{was written}} by Dana Gould and {{directed}} by Pete Michels. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 22, 2002. The idea for the episode was also pitched by Gould, who had just moved to southern California with his wife. After moving in, the two decided to install an alarm system because, Gould quipped, [...] "the police aren't enough. Too many people wanna kill you." [...] When meeting the other writers, Gould pitched an episode in which Homer becomes {{the owner of a}} security company, which then became [...] "Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge." [...] Although current showrunner Al Jean found it [...] "very funny," [...] the episode's first draft was heavily altered after the first table-read, a process in which the script is read out loud to the other writers. During the blackout, Lenny and Carl accidentally crash their cars into a store, causing a riot to erupt. The sequence was conceived by Gould who, after the 1992 Los Angeles riots, was [...] "somewhat obsessed" [...] with civil unrest issues. In the DVD commentary for the episode, he said [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of, 'All you need is for the power to go out and slowly the fabric of society unravels." [...] While trying to determine who stole Lisa's Malibu Stacy car, Homer holds Bart as his prime suspect. Unbeknownst to Bart, who is eating an apple, Homer tells Lisa [...] "Look at him over there, eating that apple. What is he planning?" [...] Originally, the scene would show Homer suspecting Lisa, but because it bothered the character's voice actor, Yeardley Smith, the scene was changed. American actor Joe Mantegna reprises his role as Fat Tony in the episode.|$|E
50|$|According to Kelly, he {{conveyed}} {{the concept of}} the short to his Squidbillies writer-producer friend Jim Fortier, who in turn described it to Adult Swim executive Mike Lazzo, who <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea.</b> <b>The</b> footage was filmed over a period of three days in October 2013 with a cast completely composed of extras from the Atlanta area. Post-production took a year, with Kelly recruiting friends and co-workers to help with the process.|$|R

500|$|At {{the time}} of the video's release, several critics took notice of the {{similarities}} in Eminem's attire and Carey's stalker. Nick Levine from Digital Spy wrote: [...] "It isn't quite as ridiculous as we were hoping, and Mariah's insisting the male stalker she plays isn't meant to be a 'specific person', but there's still plenty to enjoy in the 'Obsessed' video. There is a lot of MC cleavage, a not entirely convincing fake beard and a neat Mean Girls reference towards the end." [...] Newsdays Corris Little described it as [...] "genius!" [...] and continued, [...] "Move over Eminem, I'm officially obsessed with Mariah Carey. Who isn't? She can sing, she's pretty and she has really fun music videos." [...] A writer from the Evening Standard called the video [...] "shocking", and felt that Carey's disguise was so convincing, she should assume the role more often if she wants to travel incognito. The New York Posts Jarett Wieselman described it as [...] "human butterfly embrac her macho side", and concluded his review with [...] "I'm guessing the video involves Mariah's butch bellhop becoming a little infatuated with the singer, or something. Basically it's another way to give her double the screentime – much like that Mariah-on-Mariah fight in 'Heartbreaker'!" [...] New York Daily News writer Chris Baud joked about Eminem going one step further, writing: [...] "It's great that Mariah seems to be having fun with this whole 'Miminem' thing, but we're afraid of the conflict going any further, because no one wants to see the next step: Eminem in drag." [...] Jennifer Armstrong from Entertainment Weekly complimented Carey for [...] "going after" [...] Eminem, and concluded [...] "I like Mariah with a sense of humor, and I <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of her turning the tables on the king of celebrity-mocking videos." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first part}} of the finale {{received}} critical acclaim. Ramsey Isler of IGN thought it [...] "fantastic," [...] because it was [...] "a great story that leads us into one hell of a conclusion to the season," [...] and that it [...] "right away [...] us the deepest, most exciting look into the alternate universe we've seen so far." [...] He rated it 9.0/10. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly and MTV's Josh Wigler agreed on this last point, with Tucker noting the first part [...] "was a complete success and a blast at giving us a fully lived-in alternate universe." [...] Noel Murray of The Onions The A.V. Club graded the first part with an A−, calling it [...] "a fun, exciting episode that nicely set up next week's finale". Isler, Wigler, and Murray loved the return of the Cortexifan subjects; Murray docked the episode a half point, explaining [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of Olivia & The Cortexifanatics so much that I'm bummed Fringe burned through the group so quickly." [...] Critic Andrew Hanson, writing for the Los Angeles Times, noted that because of the parallel universe focus, the first part felt like the following season's premiere. He praised the opening scene, and believed the scenes between Peter and his mother helped [...] "ground the episode. They might be out of pace with the action and drama pouring out of every other moment, but there was weight and emotion. Bravo Joshua Jackson and Orla Brady. Bravo." [...] Ken Tucker noted that the scenes with Peter and his true mother indicated [...] "a great, humantistic use of a sci-fi trope". MTV's Josh Wigler praised Torv's performance, but wished the two-part finale was not broken up, explaining [...] "I could have easily tuned in for another several hours. Heck, I could watch an entire parallel series focused solely on the alternate universe!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Filming for {{the series}} takes place in New York City, in areas of Brooklyn and Long Island City that still look like the old Hell's Kitchen, in {{addition}} to sound stage work.

We <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of beauty and the decay of the city, and Hell's Kitchen being a place that's both beautiful and gritty at the same time.

2500|$|People's Park is now co-managed by the {{university}} and various community groups.

2500|$|According to PC Gamer, [...] "Though his {{games are}} {{frequently}} about violent times and places, {{there is never}} any blood or gore shown. He designs and creates his games by playing them, over and over, until they are fun." [...] Meier worked with a team on a dinosaur-themed game starting in early 2000, but announced in an online development diary in 2001 that the game had been shelved. Despite trying various approaches, including turn-based and real-time gameplay, he said he found no {{way to make the}} concept fun enough. In 2005, he said, [...] "We've been nonstop busy making other games over the past several years, so the dinosaur game remains on the shelf.
