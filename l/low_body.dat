5|$|Myxedema coma {{is a rare}} but {{life-threatening}} {{state of}} extreme hypothyroidism. It may occur in those who {{are known to have}} hypothyroidism when they develop another illness, but it can be the first presentation of hypothyroidism. The illness is characterized by very <b>low</b> <b>body</b> temperature without shivering, confusion, a slow heart rate and reduced breathing effort. There may be physical signs suggestive of hypothyroidism, such as skin changes or enlargement of the tongue.|$|E
5|$|Burns are {{generally}} preventable. Treatment {{depends on the}} severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in <b>low</b> <b>body</b> temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection. Tetanus toxoid should be given if not up to date.|$|E
30|$|In the L group, {{volume of}} {{bleeding}} was significantly smaller, and the <b>lowest</b> <b>body</b> temperature {{was significantly lower}} in the L group than in the O group (22 [*]±[*] 35.1 [*]mL vs 70 [*]±[*] 34.5 [*]mL, respectively, P[*]<[*] 0.01; 35.6 [*]±[*] 0.8 [*]°C vs 36.5 [*]±[*] 0.4 [*]°C, respectively, P[*]<[*] 0.01). And severe hypothermia was significantly more in the L group (7 cases vs 0 cases P[*]=[*] 0.01). There was an inverse correlation between the <b>lowest</b> <b>body</b> temperature and anesthesia time (r =[*]−[*] 0.464, P[*]<[*] 0.01). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that anesthesia time {{was a significant predictor}} of hypothermia.|$|R
30|$|In {{both the}} trainings {{and the two}} ‘Ice Miles’, the <b>lowest</b> <b>body</b> core {{temperatures}} were recorded after {{getting out of the}} water. Afterdrop, defined as continued cooling following removal from cold stress, was investigated in eleven subjects following the ‘New Year’s Day Alcatraz Swim’ held in open water of ~ 11.7 °C (Nuckton et al. 2000). The <b>lowest</b> recorded <b>body</b> core temperatures of all eleven subjects ranged from 34.7 to 36.7 °C with a mean of 36.0 °C. All subjects with recorded pre-event temperatures had post-event <b>lowest</b> <b>body</b> core temperatures that were lower than the pre-event body core temperatures. On average, the mean decrease in body core temperature was 0.99 °C. In nine subjects, body core temperature was measured for 45  min post swim and potential predictors were investigated. The surface/volume ratio and BMI were related to the <b>lowest</b> recorded <b>body</b> core temperature and the duration of the afterdrop. Smaller subjects had lower body core temperatures than larger subjects and the duration of the afterdrop was shorter in smaller individuals (Nuckton et al. 2000).|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In {{an attempt}} to {{restrict}} body weight of broiler breeder pullets, the following treatments were used: (1) timed feeding daily, 2800 kcal. M. E. /kg., (2) skip-a-day feeding, 2800 kcal. M. E. /kg., (3) limited feeding daily, 2800 kcal. M. E. /kg., (4) skip-a-day feeding, 1830 kcal. M. E. /kg., and (5) limited feeding daily, 1830 kcal. M. E. /kg. All diets were isonitrogenous. Skip-a-day feeding resulted in the <b>lowest</b> <b>body</b> weight at 22 weeks of age and the <b>lowest</b> content of <b>body</b> fat of the three feeding methods. High energy diets produced lower body weights and lower fat content than low energy diets. The combined treatment of skip-a-day feeding and high energy diet produced the <b>lowest</b> <b>body</b> weight and fat content. Breeder production records were essentially {{the same for all}} treatments...|$|R
5|$|In 1986, J.Scott Turner and C.Richard Tracy {{proposed}} that {{the evolution of a}} sail in Dimetrodon was related to the evolution of warm-bloodedness in mammal ancestors. They thought that the sail of Dimetrodon enabled it to be homeothermic, maintaining a constant, albeit <b>low,</b> <b>body</b> temperature. Mammals are also homeothermic, although they differ from Dimetrodon in being endothermic, controlling their body temperature internally through heightened metabolism. Turner and Tracy noted that early therapsids, a more advanced group of synapsids closely related to mammals, had long limbs which can release heat {{in a manner similar to}} that of the sail of Dimetrodon. The homeothermy that developed in animals like Dimetrodon may have carried over to therapsids through a modification of body shape, which would eventually develop into the warm-bloodedness of mammals.|$|E
5|$|Tom Mankiewicz {{completed}} a script titled The Batman in June 1983, focusing on Batman and Dick Grayson's origins, with the Joker and Rupert Thorne as villains, and Silver St. Cloud as the romantic interest. Mankiewicz took {{inspiration from the}} limited series Batman: Strange Apparitions, written by Steve Englehart. Comic book artist Marshall Rogers, who worked with Englehart on Strange Apparitions, was hired for concept art. The Batman was then announced in late 1983 for a mid-1985 release date on a budget of $20 million. Originally, Mankiewicz had wanted an unknown actor for Batman, William Holden for James Gordon, David Niven as Alfred Pennyworth, and Peter O'Toole as the Penguin, whom Mankiewicz wanted to portray as a mobster with <b>low</b> <b>body</b> temperature. Holden died in 1981 and Niven in 1983, so this would never come to pass. A number of filmmakers were attached to Mankiewicz' script, including Ivan Reitman and Joe Dante. Reitman wanted to cast Bill Murray as Batman and Eddie Murphy as Robin. Nine rewrites were performed by nine separate writers. Most of them were based on Strange Apparitions. However, it was Mankiewicz's script that was still being used to guide the project.|$|E

The present study assessed the current prevalence of protein-energy wasting, <b>low</b> lean <b>body</b> mass index and obesity in maintenance dialysis patients, and compared different methods of nutritional assessment. In a cross-sectional study conducted in 2014 at Roskilde Hospital, Denmark, we performed anthropometry (body weight, skinfolds, mid-arm, waist, and hip circumferences), and determined plasma albumin and normalized protein catabolic rate in order to assess the prevalence of protein-energy wasting, <b>low</b> lean <b>body</b> mass index and obesity in these patients. Seventy-nine eligible maintenance dialysis patients participated. The prevalence of protein-energy wasted patients was 4 % (95 % CI: 2 - 12) as assessed by the coexistence of <b>low</b> lean <b>body</b> mass index and low fat mass index. <b>Low</b> lean <b>body</b> mass index was seen in 32 % (95 % CI: 22 - 44). Obesity prevalence as assessed from fat mass index was 43 % (95 % CI: 32 - 55). Coexistence of <b>low</b> lean <b>body</b> mass index and obesity was seen in 10 % (95 % CI: 5 - 19). The prevalence of protein-energy wasting and obesity varied considerably, depending on nutritional assessment methodology. Our data indicate that protein-energy wasting is uncommon, whereas <b>low</b> lean <b>body</b> mass index and obesity are frequent conditions among patients in maintenance dialysis. A focus on how to increase and preserve lean body mass in dialysis patients is suggested in the future. In order to clearly distinguish between shortage, sufficiency and abundance of protein and/or fat deposits in maintenance dialysis patients, we suggest the simple measurements of lean body mass index and fat mass index...|$|R

30|$|During {{training}} and the ‘Ice Miles’, body core temperature was measured using a thermoelectric probe before, during and after swimming. During trainings and the ‘Ice Miles’, body core temperature increased after start, dropped during swimming but was lowest during recovery. During training, body core temperature at start was the only predictor (ß = − 0.233, p =  0.025) for the increase in body core temperature. Water temperature (ß =  0.07, p =  0.006) and body core temperature at start (ß = − 0.90, p =  0.006) explained 61 % of the variance for the non-significant decrease in body core temperature. Water temperature (ß =  0.077, p =  0.0059) and body core temperature at finish (ß =  0.444, p =  0.02) {{were the most important}} predictors for the <b>lowest</b> <b>body</b> core temperature. In ‘Ice Miles’, body core temperature was highest ~ 6 – 18  min after the start (38.3 – 38.4 °C), dropped during swimming by 1.7 °C to ~ 36.5 °C and was lowest ~ 40 – 56  min after finish.
