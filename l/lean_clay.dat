A CCBE {{consisting of a}} layer of fine soil and a layer of coarse soil relies on the particle size contrast of the two soils. Although CCBEs have been successfully used in dry climate, their performance under high precipitation intensities and high evaporation conditions (e. g., in South China) is still unclear. This paper aims to evaluate {{the performance of the}} CCBE in high-precipitation areas and propose appropriate combinations of local soils for constructing a CCBE in South China. Several combinations of <b>lean</b> <b>clay,</b> clayed sand, and silty sand with gravel are examined using saturated/unsaturated seepage analysis. Two contrasting conditions, i. e., a drizzle lasting {{for a long time and}} an intense storm lasting for a short time, are applied to the covers. The covers perform well when subject to prolonged small rainfall at an initial maximum suction of 150 kPa. When subject to a short-time heavy rainfall, breakthrough occurs in the cover consisting of clayed sand overlying silty sand with gravel. Of the three covers, a CCBE consisting of <b>lean</b> <b>clay</b> overlying silty sand with gravel performs well under both prolonged light rainfall and short time heavy rainfall conditions. This CCBE has the longest period of time before breakthrough and the least amount of percolated water under prolonged heavy rainfall. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Because there is limited research about frost heave and thaw weakening of pavement foundation geomaterials, this research focused on the frost heave and thaw weakening performance of geomaterials stabilized with various combinations of fly ash, cement, fibers, and fibers with cement. The first objective {{of this research was}} to conduct laboratory tests according to ASTM D 5918 to compare the effects of these stabilizers on frost susceptibility. The second objective of this research was to further associate laboratory results with in situ freeze-thaw performance of pavements with similar stabilized foundation geomaterials. For sandy <b>lean</b> <b>clay,</b> fly ash decreased frost susceptibility, and 15 % fly ash performed better than 5 %, 10 %, and 20 % fly ash. Cement decreased the frost susceptibility to very low to negligible levels for both sandy <b>lean</b> <b>clay</b> and silty sand with gravel. For silty sand with gravel, fibers alone did not significantly affect frost susceptibility, but fibers with cement performed better than the other stabilizers. Findings related to variations in compaction delay, cure time, setting time for chemical stabilizers, and cost are also reported. In situ stiffness testing conducted during frozen and after thaw conditions indicated that frozen pavements were stiffer than after thaw pavements. The trends in seasonal variation in stiffness were similar for pavement systems with all kinds of stabilization. Layers stabilized with cement and cement with fibers had the lowest stiffness changes after freeze-thaw cycles. These findings correlate with laboratory test results. This research provides guidance for selecting stabilizers to improve the frost susceptibility of pavement foundation materials...|$|E

Empirical methods commonly adopted in the past cannot always give reasonable predictions on maximum settlements or settlement troughs. As computers and computer software {{become more and more}} popular, engineers nowadays tend to rely more and more on advanced numerical analyses together with comprehensive soil models for predicting the performance of deep excavations. This study uses a simplified method developed by Jen(1998) for predicting ground settlements due to deep excavations in Taipei. The method is founded on a sound analytical framework and has been validated by many projects in Boston area. Since cohesive deposits in Taipei are <b>lean</b> sensitive <b>clay</b> with properties {{similar to those of the}} Boston Blue Clay, the method has been used in two excavations in Taipei to see whether it is equally applicable to the Taipei deposits.

The Tube Suction Test (TST) monitors the capillary rise of moisture within a 150 mm. diameter by 200 mm. high cylinder of compacted soil, assessing the materials moisture susceptibility.

The proposed study was conducted using fixed-free resonant column - torsional shear (RCTS). Specimens were compacted using the undercompaction technique. Initial shear stiffness was measured almost continuously along complex stress paths including (i) an initial equalization stage to a suction value of 0, 50, 150, and 300 kPa; (ii) an isotropic compression stage at constant suction, up to a net stress high enough to move the loading collapse line; (iii) an isotropic unloading stage at constant suction; (iv) a wetting and (or) drying path. The mentioned stress path allowed elimination or determination of the overconsolidation effect on the initial shear stiffness measured. The behavior observed is qualitatively similar to that of saturated soil, while wetting data clearly indicate that G(0) depends significantly on volumetric behavior. In normally consolidated samples where wetting is accompanied by collapse, reduction in suction has no remarkable effect on G(0). Conversely, in overconsolidated samples G(0) reduces significantly as suction decreases...|$|E

Identifying the best strategy for vegetation recovery after oil sands extraction is critical to restoring the biodiversity and functions of the pre-disturbed ecosystems. In this study, we examine how the dynamics of herbaceous and shrub vegetation abundance, diversity, and composition are affected by substrate, tree planting, and time since restoration. A total of 94 stands of 6 substrate materials (overburden, lean overburden, secondary overburden, clay overburden, and tailings), planted with conifer, mixed-wood, and broadleaf over-story ranging from 5 to 30 years old were studied. Substrate was a significant driver in vegetation cover, with overburden having the lowest average cover of 55. 17 % (SE 6. 83 %) and clay overburden having the highest average of 78. 85 % (SE 4. 41 %). Over-story composition, however, was a more significant indicator of abundance within these anthropogenic ecosystems with broadleaf over- story dominated sites having a higher abundance. Total richness was primarily driven by substrate with secondary overburden, <b>lean</b> overburden, and <b>clay</b> overburden having the highest richness. Multivariate analysis indicated that plant communities were compositionally distinct across substrates, age, and over-story. Compositionally, herbaceous species were significantly affected by all independent variables {{with the exception of}} the three way interaction, while shrubs were significantly affected by substrate and age, as well as their interaction and age?s interaction with over-story. When examining the multivariate links between diversity and productivity in the reclaimed oil sand ecosystems, we used 70 reclaimed plots of varying stand ages, conifer cover, diversity, and substrate conditions (i. e., clay content and nitrogen content) through structural equation models. We show that over-story and total biomass was strongly positively influenced by stand age and Shannon?s index. Conifer cover and total cover had large negative effects on understory aboveground biomass. Our results demonstrate that plant communities? substrate has the strongest influence on abundance, richness, and composition within the oil sand restoration. Our results suggest that substrate is the most dominant factor in the ongoing restoration of the oil sands, particularly within the clay overburden and secondary overburden substrates. lastly, our results have shown understory biomass is limited by over-story composition.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the relationships between penetration resistance, dry density, moisture content, and resilient modulus of subgrade soils. The DCPT tests were conducted at eight sites. The nuclear gage and sand cone methods were used to estimate the dry density and moisture content of the subgrade soils. Disturbed soil samples were collected in the field. Atterberg limits and sieve analysis tests were conducted in the laboratory. For selected sites, laboratory DCPT tests were performed in a 12 -inch mold along the compaction curves, and unconfined compression tests were conducted on 2. 8 -inch samples. The contours of laboratory penetration index with respect to dry density and moisture content were developed.

It is a soil characteristic that depends on sample preparation method and wetting-drying history. A comprehensive study of the microporosity structure of a <b>lean</b> <b>clay</b> with sand was conducted in this research to investigate variations of the microporosity structure during compaction, saturation, and drying processes. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the microporosity structure of soil sample surfaces.

The experimental results show that a dual-porosity structure (i. e., inter-aggregate pores and intra-aggregate pores) forms during the compaction process. The interaggregate pores are compressible and the associated volume is closely related to the final void ratio of the compacted sample. Changes to interaggregate pores is dominant during compaction, but changes to intra-aggregate pores is dominant during saturation and drying. Based on the experimental results, a dual-porosity structure model was developed by relating the pore-size distribution to the void ratio. Consequently, the pore-size distribution at any void ratio can be predicted...|$|E

Six series of laboratory tests had been set up, on <b>lean</b> <b>clay</b> samples, to investigate simultaneously the effect of volume of solution and curing time.

The volume of the saturated solution was fixed and all of the samples were held in a chamber with desired condition of temperature and humidity for different curing period, followed by a mechanical and chemical test. The findings released from the tests indicated that the length of curing period and volume of saturated lime solution at which curing took place had an important influence on the amount of strength developed. An exponential evolution was found for the uni-axial strength {{as a consequence of the}} curing time. Especially after 28 days.

The method relies on drain flow rates, slope geometry, and soil hydraulic conductivity. The corrugated shape of groundwater profiles between drains and {{the departure of the}} groundwater surface from the drain near its uphill end were verified using laboratory-scale physical and computer modeling. In 2007, a study was conducted seeking to confirm these findings using field-scale modeling. The test site con-sists of a 2 H: 1 V (2 horizontal: 1 vertical), 30 3 12 ft (9. 1 3 3. 7 m) concrete slope representing low-perme-ability bedrock. Five perforated pipes embedded in the concrete are used to simulate base-flow recharge. The concrete was covered with a <b>lean</b> <b>clay,</b> and two wick drains were installed at a spacing of 8 ft (2. 4 m). Fifty standpipe piezometers were installed to measure ground-water profiles between and along drains. Measurements were taken during recharge and drawdown events.

The variations are most likely due to factors such as heterogeneous soil properties, the development of preferential pathways, boundary effects, etc. Field-testing also yielded additional information about the behavior of drained slopes that may be useful for future slope-stability projects.

Further, it {{can be viewed as a}} suitable tool with which to analyze the cyclic behavior of unsaturated soils in a wide strain range. In this study, a new stress path suction-controlled cyclic triaxial device is presented. It is fitted for suction-controlled testing by the axis-translation technique. Pore-air and pore-water pressures are applied at the top and bottom of the specimen by using two electro-pneumatic regulators.

Surveys of and interviews with professionals working in trenchless-related industries in Iowa were conducted, {{and the results were}} analyzed and compared to survey results from the United States as a whole. The surveys focused on method familiarity, pavement distress observed, reliability of trenchless methods, and future improvements. Results indicate that the frequency of pavement distress or other trenchless-related issues are an ongoing problem in the industry. Inadequate soil information and quality control/quality assurance (QC/QA) are partially to blame. Fieldwork involving the observation of trenchless construction projects was undertaken with the purpose of documenting current practices and applications of trenchless technology in the United States and Iowa.

Much of the FRLC burned during the 2002 Missionary Ridge Fire and active landslides were observed by 2005. Previous studies of this landslide complex (Schulz et al., 2006) focused on assessing landslide activity using subsurface sampling, geologic mapping, and ground displacement monitoring. The purpose of this research was to: (1) determine the clay mineralogy; (2) estimate the engineering properties of the soil; and, (3) evaluate the swelling potential of the soil for a relatively steep section of the FRLC. A soil sample was collected, in May 2012, and determined to have a Liquid Limit (LL) of 23. 5 %, a Plastic Limit (PL) of 18. 5 %, yielding in a Plasticity Index (PI) of 5 %. Based on the LL and PL, the soil was classified as a low plasticity, <b>lean</b> <b>clay</b> (CL-ML). The relatively low PI and low LL moisture content indicate a low swelling soil potential. A plot of “PI versus Percentage of Clay in the whole sample” (clay percentages range from 40. 6 % to 79. 4 %) similarly supports a low swell potential. XRD clay speciation data verified the lack of Smectite (swelling) clay in five soil samples; the randomly ordered (R 0) I/S clay fraction (with 90 % Smectite clay), never exceeded 3. 6 % of the clay fraction (two samples contained less than 1 %). In three of the soil samples the R 1, Mixed layer I/S (with 30 % Smectite clay) fraction ranged from 46 to 63 %. However, Kaolinite was the predominant clay fraction in the majority of the samples.

40|$|Permeability {{anisotropy}} (ratio {{of horizontal}} to vertical permeability) {{is an important}} but uncertain parameter used in characterizing underground formations. While it is a fairly unknown parameter, it is integral for the petroleum industry, where a greater permeability anisotropy understanding can greatly aid in basin modelling, pore pressure prediction, and borehole stability. This research experimentally characterizes the permeability anisotropy of several mudrocks, which are clay-rich sedimentary formations, using re-sedimentation, a process of homogenization of naturally-occurring soils and recreation of the sedimentation environment in a controlled laboratory setting. The permeability anisotropy of resedimented Boston Blue Clay (RBBC), an illitic <b>lean</b> <b>clay</b> (CL), increases from 1. 5 to 3 when mechanically compressed from 0. 1 to 40 MPa, corresponding to porosities ranging from 0. 55 to 0. 26. Resedimented Gulf of Mexico - Eugene Island mudrock (RGoM-EI), a smectitic fat clay (CH), exhibits permeability anisotropy increasing from 1 to 5 when compressed to the same stresses, corresponding to porosities ranging from 0. 6 to 0. 25. Not only does smectitic RGoM-EI mudrock transition to greater anisotropy with compression, but {{the rate of increase}} accelerates with compression. These measurements are made using a commercially-available Trautwein® constant rate of strain (CRS) consolidometer with vertical drainage combined with a novel radially-outward draining CRS device. The combination of the vertically and radially draining CRS devices produces permeability anisotropy data quickly, with very little scatter. For RGoM-EI, the effects of horizontal shearing to 29. 5 % shear strain at 0. 14 MPa on permeability anisotropy are negligible. Permeability anisotropy of the homogeneous resedimented mudrocks tested, using a cubic specimen constant head permeameter within a triaxial cell, is directly correlated to their electrical conductivity anisotropy. The permeability anisotropy values measured using this technology, however, are lower than those measured using CRS testing. by Taylor James Nordquist. Thesis: S.
