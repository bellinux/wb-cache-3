5|$|In {{embryonic}} development, the <b>lungs</b> {{begin to}} develop as an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which goes on to form {{the upper part of}} the digestive system. When the <b>lungs</b> are formed the fetus is held in the fluid-filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe. Blood is also diverted from the <b>lungs</b> through the ductus arteriosus. At birth however, air begins to pass through the <b>lungs,</b> and the diversionary duct closes, so that the <b>lungs</b> can begin to respire. The <b>lungs</b> only fully develop in early childhood.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have one}} of the most complex {{respiratory}} systems of all animal groups. Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the <b>lungs</b> and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the <b>lungs</b> and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the <b>lungs.</b> When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the <b>lungs</b> and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the <b>lungs.</b> Thus, a bird's <b>lungs</b> receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from {{the lower end of the}} trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations and the perception of the bird's size.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lungs</b> can be {{affected}} {{by a variety of}} diseases. Pulmonology is the medical speciality that deals with diseases involving the respiratory tract, and cardiothoracic surgery is the surgical field that deals with surgery of the <b>lungs.</b>|$|E

5|$|Some {{invertebrates}} have lung-like {{structures that}} serve a similar respiratory purpose as, {{but are not}} evolutionarily related to, vertebrate <b>lungs.</b> Some arachnids, such as spiders and scorpions, have structures called book <b>lungs</b> used for atmospheric gas exchange. Some species of spider have four pairs of book <b>lungs</b> but most have two pairs. Scorpions have spiracles on their body for the entrance of air to the book <b>lungs.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>lungs</b> {{also serve}} a {{protective}} role. Several blood-borne substances, {{such as a}} few types of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, serotonin and bradykinin, are excreted through the <b>lungs.</b> Drugs and other substances can be absorbed, modified or excreted in the <b>lungs.</b> The <b>lungs</b> filter out small blood clots from veins and prevent them from entering arteries and causing strokes.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lungs</b> of most {{frogs and}} other {{amphibians}} are simple and balloon-like, with gas exchange {{limited to the}} outer surface of the lung. This is not very efficient, but amphibians have low metabolic demands and can also quickly dispose of carbon dioxide by diffusion across their skin in water, and supplement their oxygen supply by the same method. Amphibians employ a positive pressure system to get air to their <b>lungs,</b> forcing air down into the <b>lungs</b> by buccal pumping. This is distinct from most higher vertebrates, who use a breathing system driven by negative pressure where the <b>lungs</b> are inflated by expanding the rib cage. In buccal pumping, {{the floor of the}} mouth is lowered, filling the mouth cavity with air. The throat muscles then presses the throat against the underside of the skull, forcing the air into the <b>lungs.</b>|$|E

5|$|The <b>lungs</b> of most {{reptiles}} have {{a single}} bronchus running down the centre, from which numerous branches reach out to individual pockets throughout the <b>lungs.</b> These pockets are similar to alveoli in mammals, but much larger and fewer in number. These give the lung a sponge-like texture. In tuataras, snakes, and some lizards, the <b>lungs</b> are simpler in structure, {{similar to that of}} typical amphibians.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis may infect {{any part}} of the body, but most {{commonly}} occurs in the <b>lungs</b> (known as pulmonary tuberculosis). Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the <b>lungs,</b> although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} parasites {{can affect the}} <b>lungs,</b> {{including}} Toxoplasma gondii, Strongyloides stercoralis, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Plasmodium malariae. These organisms typically enter the body through {{direct contact with the}} skin, ingestion, or via an insect vector. Except for Paragonimus westermani, most parasites do not affect specifically the <b>lungs</b> but involve the <b>lungs</b> secondarily to other sites. Some parasites, in particular those belonging to the Ascaris and Strongyloides genera, stimulate a strong eosinophilic reaction, which may result in eosinophilic pneumonia. In other infections, such as malaria, lung involvement is due primarily to cytokine-induced systemic inflammation. In the developed world these infections are most common in people returning from travel or in immigrants. Around the world, these infections are most common in the immunodeficient.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} <b>lung</b> volumes and four <b>lung</b> capacities. A <b>lung</b> {{capacity}} {{consists of two}} or more <b>lung</b> volumes. The <b>lung</b> volumes are tidal volume (VT), inspiratory reserve volume (IRV), expiratory reserve volume (ERV), and residual volume (RV). The four <b>lung</b> capacities are total <b>lung</b> capacity (TLC), inspiratory capacity (IC), functional residual capacity (FRC) and vital capacity (VC).|$|R

5|$|Adult {{amphibians}} {{and most}} reptiles {{have a double}} circulatory system, meaning a circulatory system divided into arterial and venous parts. However, the heart itself is not completely separated into two sides. Instead, it is separated into three chambers – two atria and one ventricle. Blood returning from both the systemic circulation and the <b>lungs</b> is returned, and blood is pumped simultaneously into the systemic circulation and the <b>lungs.</b> The double system allows blood to circulate to and from <b>lungs</b> which deliver oxygenated blood directly to the heart.|$|E
5|$|Before diving, {{pinnipeds}} typically exhale {{to empty}} their <b>lungs</b> {{of half the}} air and then close their nostrils and throat cartilages to protect the trachea. Their unique <b>lungs</b> have airways that are highly reinforced with cartilaginous rings and smooth muscle, and alveoli that completely deflate during deeper dives. While terrestrial mammals are generally unable to empty their <b>lungs,</b> pinnipeds can reinflate their <b>lungs</b> even after complete respiratory collapse. The middle ear contains sinuses that probably fill with blood during dives, preventing middle ear squeeze. The heart of a seal is moderately flattened to allow the <b>lungs</b> to deflate. The trachea is flexible enough to collapse under pressure. During deep dives, any remaining air in their bodies is stored in the bronchioles and trachea, which prevents them from experiencing decompression sickness, oxygen toxicity and nitrogen narcosis. In addition, seals can tolerate large amounts of lactic acid, which reduces skeletal muscle fatigue during intense physical activity.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles are {{normally}} {{produced in the}} vascular bed and transported by the venous system to heart, then to the <b>lungs.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Lung</b> cancer, {{also known}} as <b>lung</b> carcinoma, is a {{malignant}} <b>lung</b> tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the <b>lung.</b> This growth can spread beyond the <b>lung</b> {{by the process of}} metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in the <b>lung,</b> known as primary <b>lung</b> cancers, are carcinomas. The two main types are small-cell <b>lung</b> carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell <b>lung</b> carcinoma (NSCLC). The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains.|$|R

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that barotrauma is causing bat fatalities around wind turbines. Bats have typical mammalian <b>lungs,</b> which {{are thought to}} be more sensitive to sudden air pressure changes than the <b>lungs</b> of birds, making them more liable to fatal rupture. In addition, {{it has been suggested that}} bats are attracted to these structures, perhaps seeking roosts, and thereby increasing the death rate. Acoustic deterrents may help to reduce bat mortality at wind farms.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their function in respiration, the <b>lungs</b> also {{have a number of}} other functions. They are involved in maintaining homeostasis, helping in the regulation of blood pressure as part of the renin-angiotensin system. The inner lining of the blood vessels secretes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. The <b>lungs</b> are involved in the blood's acid-base homeostasis by expelling carbon dioxide when breathing.|$|E
5|$|Narrowing of the airways occurs due to {{inflammation}} and scarring within them. This {{contributes to the}} inability to breathe out fully. The greatest reduction in air flow occurs when breathing out, as the pressure in the chest is compressing the airways at this time. This can result in more air from the previous breath remaining within the <b>lungs</b> when the next breath is started, resulting {{in an increase in}} the total volume of air in the <b>lungs</b> at any given time, a process called hyperinflation or air trapping. Hyperinflation from exercise is linked to shortness of breath in COPD, as it is less comfortable to breathe in when the <b>lungs</b> are already partly full. Hyperinflation may also worsen during an exacerbation.|$|E
40|$|Ventilator-induced <b>lung</b> injury after pneumonectomy, a {{life-threatening}} complication of excessive one-lung mechanical ventilation <b>Lung</b> edema after <b>lung</b> resection {{is associated with}} a mortality of 50 – 100 % and no cure. In sheep we found that removal of one <b>lung</b> followed by excessive one-lung ventilation triggered a severe <b>lung</b> injury with <b>lung</b> edema. This is a novel model of acute <b>lung</b> injury (ALI) in a large animal. Inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase improved oxygenation, but did not prevent <b>lung</b> edema from developing...|$|R
30|$|We {{divided the}} whole <b>lung</b> into four regions: right upper <b>lung</b> (including right upper lobe and median lobe), right lower <b>lung,</b> left upper <b>lung</b> and left lower <b>lung.</b> The volume of <b>lung</b> atelectasis/consolidation was {{arbitrarily}} separated into small (maximal thickness < 50  mm) and massive (≥ 50  mm) [4]. According {{to the changes}} of ultrasonic pattern during breathing cycle, <b>lung</b> atelectasis/consolidation was distinguished to a complete or incomplete one (Fig.  1).|$|R
30|$|In this healthy {{animal model}} in which <b>lung</b> {{recruitment}} was negligible, prone position was associated with an amelioration of <b>lung</b> mechanics, a higher functional residual capacity and a different, more homogenous distribution of <b>lung</b> aeration than supine position. <b>Lung</b> recruitment, defined as an opening of previously collapsed <b>lung</b> units, is thus not necessary per se for prone position to improve <b>lung</b> mechanical properties and increase <b>lung</b> gas content.|$|R
5|$|Reptilian <b>lungs</b> {{typically}} receive air via {{expansion and}} contraction of the ribs driven by axial muscles and buccal pumping. Crocodilians also {{rely on the}} hepatic piston method, in which the liver is pulled back by a muscle anchored to the pubic bone (part of the pelvis) called the diaphragmaticus, which in turn creates negative pressure in the crocodile's thoracic cavity, allowing air to be moved into the <b>lungs</b> by Boyle's law. Turtles, which are unable to move their ribs, instead use their forelimbs and pectoral girdle to force air {{in and out of}} the <b>lungs.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{coconut crab}} is {{terrestrial}} and uses structures called branchiostegal <b>lungs</b> to breathe air.

5|$|The heart {{functions}} as a pump in the circulatory system to provide a continuous flow of blood throughout the body.

The systemic circulation then transports oxygen to the body and returns carbon dioxide and relatively deoxygenated blood to the heart for transfer to the <b>lungs.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractWith the {{increase}} in the number of <b>lung</b> transplants, it is expected that there will be a corresponding increase in the number of <b>lung</b> cancers reported in these patients. Longevity of the transplant recipients, <b>lung</b> transplantation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a history of smoking, and the increasing age of the <b>lung</b> donors make <b>lung</b> cancer more likely. Nodules and masses seen in chest imaging in <b>lung</b> transplant patients call for work up until a final diagnosis is achieved because there is a high likelihood of a serious infection or malignancy. The presence of a native <b>lung</b> is a major risk factor for <b>lung</b> cancer occurring in the transplant setting. <b>Lung</b> cancer of donor origin is rare. Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma confined to one <b>lung</b> can potentially be treated by transplanting the affected <b>lung.</b> Treatment for patients with <b>lung</b> cancer in the <b>lung</b> transplant setting has to be individualized because of the complexity of their medical problems and multiple medications. Attention needs to be focused on detecting <b>lung</b> cancer early in these patients to achieve a favorable outcome...|$|R
40|$|Independent <b>lung</b> {{ventilation}} (ILV) can {{be classified}} into anatomical and physiological <b>lung</b> separation.

Anatomical <b>lung</b> separation isolates a diseased <b>lung</b> from contaminating the nondiseased <b>lung.</b> Physiological <b>lung</b> separation ventilates each <b>lung</b> as an independent unit. There are some clear indications for ILV as a primary intervention and as a rescue ventilator strategy in both anatomical and physiological <b>lung</b> separation. Potential pitfalls are related to establishing and maintaining <b>lung</b> isolation.
