40|$|South African {{company law}} has {{provided}} for the rescue of financially distressed companies since 1926 when the statutory procedure of judicial management was introduced by the Companies Act 46 of 1926. Unfortunately, judicial management has never been regarded as a successful corporate <b>rescue</b> <b>procedure</b> {{and for most of}} its existence it has been severely criticised on many grounds. The Companies Act 61 of 1973 that replaced the Companies Act 46 of 1926 did very little to improve this situation and judicial management remained underutilised. As a result, the Companies Act 71 of 2008 now introduces two newly-created corporate <b>rescue</b> <b>procedures</b> in the form of business rescue proceedings and the compromise with creditors. This study analyses judicial management and the new corporate <b>rescue</b> <b>procedures</b> to establish whether the identified weaknesses of judicial management have been adequately and effectively addressed in the new procedures. A comparative study with similar procedures in England and Germany is undertaken to determine whether the South African legislature has delivered on its promise to create a system of corporate rescue that will meet the needs of a modern South African economy. Several weaknesses in the new procedures are identified and a number of recommendations are made to improve the relevant provisions and to assist in providing South African company law with an efficient and acceptable corporate rescue regime.

40|$|Hong Kong is {{a modern}} global city with a {{reputation}} for well-regulated financial markets, but for years, the government had been trying to enact laws on corporate <b>rescue</b> <b>procedures</b> with relatively little success. It is under the pretext of the Global Financial Crisis, the threat of a future economic meltdown gave the Hong Kong government the impetus to revisit this issue. This third attempt to codify statutory obligations on directors’ liability for insolvent trading has been criticised for either setting the standards too high or low for directors trading whilst insolvent. There is also some reservation given the beliefs and values of directors in Chinese family-owned and controlled companies. These companies would most likely trade out the difficult times.

40|$|Recently {{developed}} vector systems {{based on}} Borna disease virus (BDV) hold promise as platforms for efficient and stable gene delivery {{to the central}} nervous system (CNS). However, because it currently takes several weeks to rescue recombinant BDV (rBDV), an improved <b>rescue</b> <b>procedure</b> would enhance the utility of this system. Heat stress reportedly enhances the rescue efficiency of other recombinant viruses. Here, heat stress was demonstrated {{to increase the amount of}} BDV genome in persistently BDV-infected cells without obvious cytotoxicity. Further analyses suggested that the effect of heat stress on BDV infection is not caused by an increase in the activity of BDV polymerase. More cells in which BDV replication occurs were obtained in the initial phase of rBDV rescue by using heat stress than when it was not used. Thus, heat stress is a useful improvement on the published <b>rescue</b> <b>procedure</b> for rBDV. The present findings may accelerate the practical use of BDV vector systems in basic science and the clinic and thus enable broader adoption of this viral vector, which is uniquely suited for gene delivery to the CNS...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveEdge-to-edge {{mitral valve}} repair is usually {{performed}} {{in association with}} annuloplasty, with rare exceptions. We retrospectively analyzed the results of ringless edge-to-edge repair, particularly in view of minimally invasive and percutaneous approaches. MethodsFrom November 1993 to December 2001, 81 patients underwent edge-to-edge mitral repair without associated annuloplasty. The cause was degenerative in most patients. In 32 patients the annulus was severely calcified. Type I lesions were present in 6 patients, type II lesions in 60 patients, and type III lesions in 15 patients. A double-orifice repair was done in 69 patients, and paracommissural repair was done in 12 patients. In 5 patients edge-to-edge repair {{was used as a}} <b>rescue</b> <b>procedure.</b> ResultsThere were 3 hospital and 4 late deaths, for a 4 -year survival of 85 % ± 6. 7 %. At latest follow-up, 63 patients were in New York Heart Association classes I or II, and 9 patients were in classes III or IV. Nine patients required reoperation (89 % ± 3. 9 % overall freedom from reoperation at 4 years). Annular calcification was associated with a greater reoperation rate (77 % ± 22 % vs 95 % ± 4. 6 % freedom from reoperation, P =. 03). Intraoperative water testing and postrepair transesophageal echocardiography predicted late failure. Only 1 of 42 patients required reoperation in the follow-up period when annular calcification, rheumatic disease, or <b>rescue</b> <b>procedure</b> were not present as risk factors. ConclusionsOur data confirm overall suboptimal results of the edge-to-edge technique when annuloplasty is not added to the repair. Annular calcification, rheumatic cause, and edge-to-edge repair done as a <b>rescue</b> <b>procedure</b> were associated with the worst outcome. Midterm results in selected patients encourage future developments in catheter-based edge-to-edge procedures...|$|R

40|$|Provisional {{supervision}} (PS) is Hong Kong’s {{proposed new}} corporate <b>rescue</b> <b>procedure.</b> In essence, it is a procedure for the preparation by a professional, usually an accountant or a solicitor, of {{a proposal for}} a voluntary arrangement, supported by a moratorium. There should be little court involvement in the process and it is anticipated that the costs and delays of the process would be less than alternate, currently available procedures. This article will retrace some of the key events and issues arising from the numerous policy and legislative debates about PS in Hong Kong. At present the Hong Kong government {{is in the midst of}} drafting a new Bill on corporate <b>rescue</b> <b>procedure</b> to be introduced to the HKSAR Legislative Council.

Setting aside the controversies and the content of this new effort by the Hong Kong administration, the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 has signalled to the international policy and business community, free markets alone cannot be an effective regulatory mechanism.

40|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) is a unique, functional neurosurgical therapy indicated for medication refractory movement disorders {{as well as}} some psychiatric diseases. Multicontact electrodes {{are placed}} in “deep” structures within the brain with targets varying depending on the surgical indication. An implanted programmable pulse generator supplies the electrodes with a chronic, high frequency electrical current that clinically mimics the effects of ablative lesioning techniques. DBS’s efficacy has been well established for its movement disorder indications (Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor, and dystonia). However, clinical outcomes are sometimes suboptimal, {{even in the absence of}} common, potentially reversible complications such as hardware complications, infection, poor electrode placement, and poor programming parameters. This review highlights some of the <b>rescue</b> <b>procedures</b> that have been explored in suboptimal DBS cases for Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor, and dystonia. To date, the data is limited and difficult to generalize, but a large majority of published reports demonstrate positive results. The decision to proceed with such treatments should be made on a case by case basis. Larger studies are needed to clearly establish the benefit of <b>rescue</b> <b>procedures</b> and to establish for which patient populations they may be most appropriate...|$|R
