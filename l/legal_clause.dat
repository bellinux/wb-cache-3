40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} 18 shared-use agreements (SUAs) {{implemented in}} Los Angeles County during 2010 – 2012. SUAs opened school grounds and/or facilities in seven {{school districts to}} increase physical activity opportunities for under-resourced communities with high prevalence of obesity. MethodsWe reviewed {{the extent to which}} SUAs addressed school district concerns about cost responsibility, sustainability, and scope. A school site and community partner survey was conducted to inform planning and to facilitate comparisons of the types and range of <b>legal</b> <b>clauses</b> (up to 16) contained in the agreements. We used geographic information systems and 2010 United States Census data to estimate the population reached and the potential benefits of the SUAs. ResultsSUAs varied in {{the degree to which they}} addressed the three categories of concerns. Eight of the 18 agreements included 13 of the 16 <b>legal</b> <b>clauses.</b> We estimate that these SUAs have the potential to reach nearly 165, 000 children (ages 5 – 19) and more than 500, 000 adults (ages 20 – 64) at a cost of about $ 0. 38 per community member reached. ConclusionSUAs that include <b>legal</b> <b>clauses</b> to address school concerns about factors such as vandalism, staffing and funding represent a promising strategy for increasing physical activity opportunities in under-resourced neighborhoods where the prevalence of obesity is high...|$|R

40|$|This study {{comprises}} a {{study of}} the causes of judicial separation between the spouses in Iraqi law and its analysis as an Islamic perspective. It is an analytical study that goes over the <b>legal</b> <b>clauses</b> relating to judicial separation in the Iraqi Law, with a field study on one governorate in region of Kurdistan in Iraq. The researcher has conducted the research in the offices of the Social Researcher and in the Statistics Division in the Appeals Court in Duhok governorate in Iraq, on the judicial separation of spouses’ data from the year 8002 until the end of year 8008, citing examples of the conclusive decisions to separate the spouses. This thesis aims at showing the court’s authority in separating the married couple, the extent of such authority, and the <b>legal</b> <b>clauses</b> relating to the judicial separation between spouses in Iraqi Law, and aims also at studying and analyzing such clauses {{within the framework of the}} Islamic Law. The thesis aims as well at presenting the reasons for spouses’ separation judgment, that either they common to both spouses, such as dissention between the spouses or ill companionship, or they can be from the husband, and showing their rulings in the Iraqi law, analyzing them within the framework of the Islamic Shari’ah Law, and citing the most common reasons for separation verdicts in Dohuk province. The study for this research is conducted three methodologies as follows. First is the data collection methodology. This methodology is used to do the scientific data collection from the literature in the library, where the researcher collected the scientific data on the Iraqi law and Islamic Shari’ah Law. Second is the Data Analysis Methodology. <b>Legal</b> <b>clauses</b> relating to the judicial separation between spouses were studied and analyzed from the Islamic perspective. Third is the Field Research Methodology. Field research is to carry out by going over the judicial separation of spouses verdicts’ data and going over samples of the conclusive separation decisions at the Personal Status Court in Duhok province. The research reached a number of conclusions. The most important results are the following. The Iraqi legislator needs to revise some of the <b>legal</b> <b>clauses</b> relating to spouses separation judgments, especially the kind of separation, and to follow the amendments passed by the Kurdistan province government in Iraq. The Iraqi legislator needs also to pay more attention to the issue of the Social Researcher. Among the most important reasons for the differences among Islamic Fiqh scholars over judicial separation is that there is no definitive explicit text in Quran nor in Sunnah indicating separation permissiveness or prevention. Another reason is that all rulings in the separation cases were rulings issued by the companions, where such rulings’ authentications or interpretations can be controversial. Another reason is that all the Fiqh scholars who ruled with separation cited the reason for such ruling as being the harm, where if the harm was confirmed the ruling was the separation, but if the harm was not confirmed then no separation would be ruled. That was relying on the fundamental principle that says that the ruling follows its reason whether existing or absent. And the reason for separation ruling is the harm...|$|R

Conversely, the {{weighted}} average savings and term deposit rates stabilized at 5. 30 per cent between July and October 2012. The level of interest rate {{is important in the}} mobilization and allocation of funds in an economy. Therefore, it is not surprising why the current high lending interest rate regime in Nigeria remains a source of concern to policy makers. This paper articulates the factors explaining the present high cost of funds in the Nigerian banking system and policy options useful in achieving low and sustainable interest rate objectives in Nigeria. Using descriptive analysis covering the 1990 s, when the interest rate was fully deregulated in Nigeria, up until 2012; the paper notes that high interest rate is largely driven by high sunk costs due to dearth of infrastructure. It recommends a strong legal framework for addressing loan defaults. In this direction, review of the <b>legal</b> <b>clause</b> which gives undue advantage to borrowers is critical. A time frame for the disposal of loan default cases need to be set as prolonged litigations at the instance of loan defaulters usually stall the process of take over and the consequent auctioning of borrowers ’ collateral by lenders to recover their loans. In addition, provision of constant electricity is necessary to significantly reduce bank cost of funds...|$|E

40|$|From an {{institutional}} perspective and previous {{to the analysis}} of French legislation, this paper defines the conscience clause as a <b>legal</b> <b>clause</b> which is implicit in the contracting of work in the field of journalism. According to the clause, the economic effects of the cessation of the previously existing work relation in that field stemming from the unilateral will of the worker are equivalent to those that stem from the extinction of the relationship due to the will of the employer. This takes into account certain presuppositions which are typified by Law with reference to the conscience of the informer. From a historical perspective thls notion belongs to the three stages which have been produced with regard to the juridical understanding of the realm of information: enterprisalistic, professionalistic and universalistic stages. After these preliminary considerations, the author then analyses the juridical nature of the clause which -although it proceeds from a legal origen and has an application which is both necessary and identified within the informative labor relation- does not be long to the structural framework of a fictio iuris as is claimed by the majority of writers, but rather defines an intellectual and moral right in terms of the nexus between a particular cause and sorne juridical effects. That particular cause is the very conscience of the informer, the nexus is the professional ethos of the field of information (whose central duty is precisely that of informing), and the effects are more complex than those which arise with regard to simple compensation, since they have repercussions bearing upon the very efficacy of the right to information. The paper then concludes with the utilization of the ideas clearly expressed before, in order to intepret systematically the Spanish juridical framework as it applies to contracting in the field of information...|$|E

In addition, promoting {{respect for human rights}} is a key purpose of the United Nations (UN) and its international bodies, such as the UN Human Rights Council, established in 2006, and the International Criminal Court, created in 1998. The UN has also issued a variety of protocols, declarations and agreements regarding human rights and their protection, specifically the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 and the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights in 1966. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Saudi legislation has initiated and allowed various Saudi human rights institutions, namely the Saudi Human Rights Commission and Saudi National Society for Human Rights. In particular, Saudi legislation has focused on Sharia principles {{when it comes to the}} interpretation and implementation of secular international human rights laws. Saudi legislation has enacted a variety of contemporary human rights laws, including the Child Protection Law and the Law of Protection from Abuse. The human cost of terrorism has been felt virtually in every part of the globe. Terrorism has disrupted peace, security, liberty and physical integrity of individuals at every level. Protection and security of its individuals is a fundamental obligation of the state. Accordingly, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has taken several legal measures, allowed under Islamic Sharia and International laws, to ensure the protection of human rights of its citizens and residents and safeguard the society against possible threats of terrorism and bring the criminals to justice. Saudi legislation has ensured human rights applications in other Saudi criminal laws, such as the Saudi Criminal Procedure Law of 2002, amended in 2014 (hereinafter SCPL), and the Saudi Law of Terrorist Crimes of 2014 (hereinafter SLTC). This short commentary provides a concise summary about the existing Saudi legislation related to terrorist crimes and human rights protection. of what we have created, with [definite] preference” [5]. Moreover, Article 26 of the Saudi Basic Law of Governance states that “The State shall protect human rights in accordance with the Islamic Sharia” [6]. Therefore, it can be seen that the protection of human rights in Saudi Arabia is constitutional since it is encouraged by Islamic principles and Saudi laws. Human rights are usually discussed with specific regard to the implementation of criminal punishment and procedure. Therefore, human rights are the subject matter of lots of international debates and conferences. In recent times, the majority of the countries all over the world, and especially Saudi Arabia, have suffered from terrorism. Saudi Arabia has enacted a variety of criminal laws that look after the benefits of Saudi society, one of which is the Saudi Law of Terrorist Crimes (SLTC). This law examines terrorism incidents and facilitates Saudi authorities to protect the society from terrorism and terrorists. This law contains 41 legal clauses.
