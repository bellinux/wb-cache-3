The petitioner then signs a contract with an artist at the authority to create the design. The Fraser Herald, serving as the CHA's principal artist, must review the design. At all stages the documents {{must be approved by}} both the petitioner and the Chief Herald. The final step is to prepare the letters patent, the official notice of an award of arms, which includes a drawing of the armorial bearings and the accompanying <b>legal</b> <b>text</b> and explanation of the symbolism of the bearings. Under Canadian bilingualism laws, letters patent are written in both English and French, though the petitioner may choose which language will be placed in the left column of the document.|$|E
5|$|National referendums, or plebiscites, are {{elections}} whereby {{citizens can}} {{determine whether a}} specific <b>legal</b> <b>text</b> can become official law or not. For this to take place, {{one of the following}} conditions must be met: The president wishes to hold one, both houses of the National Assembly request to hold one, or the citizens petition for it. If the National Assembly calls for a plebiscite, a majority is needed in both chambers for it to be official. If the citizens request a plebiscite, they must gather 430,000 signatures from eligible voters across the country. Additionally, over 30,000 people from each region must sign the petition, including the capital Minsk. Once either condition is met, the president must issue a decree setting the date of the national plebiscite. The plebiscite must take place less than three months after the decree was signed. Local cities can hold their own plebiscites if ten percent of the local population ask for it.|$|E

In the Middle Ages they often {{take the form of}} descriptions of situations and cases representing the conditions for the application of various rules. This combination of the normative and descriptive aspects of <b>legal</b> <b>texts</b> results in their importance as sources not only for legal, but also, more generally, for social and cultural history. The importance of <b>legal</b> <b>texts</b> as historical sources is even greater when they represent the first – and for a while the only – texts to be written in the vernacular, as is the case for medieval Scandinavian <b>legal</b> <b>texts.</b> For this reason, an investigation of the earliest <b>legal</b> <b>texts</b> can highlight some aspects of life and society in Scandinavia at that time...|$|R

25|$|While the {{majority}} of legal texts were written before the 9th century, a few were written later. The Middle Irish text, The Distribution of Cró and Dibad deals with extracting fines from a killer and dividing a dead man's property.

Powell walked out after one and a half hours, having produced translations in the styles of Plato and Thucydides. For his efforts, he was awarded a double starred first in Latin and Greek, this grade being the best possible and extremely rare. As well as his education at Cambridge, Powell took a course in Urdu at the School of Oriental Studies, now the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, because he felt that his long-cherished ambition of becoming Viceroy of India would be unattainable without knowledge of an Indian language. Powell went on to learn other languages, including Welsh (in which he jointly edited a medieval <b>legal</b> <b>text),</b> modern Greek, and Portuguese.|$|E

The sector is characterized by a significant gap between legal responsibilities of stakeholders and their actual activities. The <b>legal</b> <b>text</b> to organize the work of MEW has not been developed as of 2012. MEW’s efforts are still dedicated to investment projects and not on policy and regulation. The Ministry still has units dedicated to investment studies, although these functions should have been transferred to the Water Establishments.|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} an attempt to find the place o f the lexis o f legal acts in the {{varieties}} of the Polish language lexis, and to verify the thesis claimed by lawyers that the vocabulary used in <b>legal</b> <b>texts</b> is colloquial. The study was carried out using linguistic research methods and lexicographic dictionaries of Polish language. The main conclusions that could be drawn were that the <b>texts</b> of <b>legal</b> acts are official, and the language used in them is not colloquial. The analysis of the <b>legal</b> <b>texts</b> has shown that the legal vocabulary consists of two layers: (i) one basic lexis, common to all Polish (neutral, standard) and (2) specific lexis, differentiating it from others, composed of: (a) legal words, as referred to in dictionaries o f Polish language, (b) legal words as defined in <b>legal</b> <b>texts,</b> <b>legal</b> science or jurisdiction, and as such part of the general legal vocabulary, and (c) vocabulary of the official variety of Polish language (reserved for books, official documents, professional and scientific texts). The language of <b>legal</b> <b>texts</b> is not a colloquial form which in itself is a variety of Polish language, but unofficial, met only in oral discourse. The language of <b>legal</b> <b>texts</b> is beyond any doubt only written, and the words and expressions contained in <b>legal</b> <b>texts</b> sre not described in dictionaries of Polish language as colloquia...|$|R

25|$|This {{downward}} trend {{has been demonstrated}} by the conflicts between various agencies and levels of government. This has allowed wood traders to shop for export clearance among the authorities that regulate it. As {{a result of this}} bribery to open periodic trade windows, large-scale exports of illegal precious woods clear customs without much difficulty. Because of the incredibly lucrative nature of recent trades, reports have indicated that government officials have significantly increased the price of export certificates to make more money for themselves. This however has not stopped exporters from re-using single-use export certificates for two or three containers of rosewood. Furthermore, some of the certificates and authorizations from various government agencies bear titles found nowhere in any <b>legal</b> <b>text,</b> such as permis de ramassage and permis de carbonisation (collection permit and carbonization permit respectively). Such authorizations are not supported by and clearly conflict with Malagasy law.|$|E

His long career as a justice helped create a sense of continuity in judicial matters through the reigns of the Angevin kings. He remained on such good terms with Hubert Walter, that when Walter was appointed chancellor at the beginning of John's reign, Bardulf made a comment to the new chancellor that included a pointed barb about the last Archbishop of Canterbury to also be chancellor, Thomas Becket.

50|$|As {{pointed out}} in Nielsen 1994, law {{dictionaries}} can serve various functions. The traditional law dictionary with definitions of legal terms serves to help users understand the <b>legal</b> <b>texts</b> they read (a communicative function) or to acquire knowledge about legal matters independent of any text (a cognitive function) - such law dictionaries are usually monolingual. Bilingual law dictionaries may also serve a variety of functions. First, they may have entry words in one language and definitions in another language - these dictionaries give help to understand <b>legal</b> <b>texts,</b> usually written in a foreign language, and to acquire knowledge, usually about a foreign legal system. Second, bilingual law dictionaries with entry words in one language and equivalents in another language provide help to translate <b>legal</b> <b>texts,</b> into or from a foreign language, and sometimes also to produce <b>legal</b> <b>texts,</b> usually in a foreign language.|$|R

Samuel Midgley in his Halifax and its Gibbet-Law Placed in a True Light, published in 1761, states that the law dates from a time [...] "not in the memory of man to the contrary". It {{may have been}} the consequence of rights granted by King Henry III to John de Warenne (1231–1304), Lord of the Manor of Wakefield.

40|$|The {{present study}} is a {{contrastive}} study of inter-sentence conjunctions in Chinese/English <b>legal</b> parallel <b>texts.</b> Conjunction {{is one of the}} five cohesive devices put forward by Halliday and Hasan (1976). Many scholars have applied their model of cohesion to the study of English and Chinese languages. As for the use of conjunction in Chinese and English, most scholars believe that there are more cases of conjunction in the English <b>legal</b> <b>texts</b> than in the Chinese ones because it is generally considered that Chinese is predominantly paratactic and English mainly hypotactic. Besides, up to now little detailed contrastive study has been done on conjunctions in Chinese/English non-literary <b>texts.</b> <b>Legal</b> language is a specialized language whose distinctive feature is the pursuit of precision. As a result of the importance attached to the letter of law and the pursuit of precision in <b>legal</b> <b>texts,</b> most studies on legal language are devoted to the characteristic features of legal language at the word and sentence level, to the exclusion of textual and pragmatic considerations. The present study will mainly look at the features of <b>legal</b> <b>texts</b> from the perspective of conjunction at the textual level and find out whether Chinese uses fewer cases of conjunction than English in <b>legal</b> <b>texts.</b> The Chinese and English <b>legal</b> parallel <b>texts</b> about arbitration rules will be used for this contrastive analysis. It is hoped that the findings of this research will test the explanatory force of hypotaxis and parataxis in the use of conjunction in <b>legal</b> <b>texts</b> and give a clearer picture of conjunction at the textual level in Chinese and English <b>legal</b> parallel <b>texts,</b> and therefore reconstruct the discourse on the Chinese language...|$|R
