5|$|In the 1850s, some tenant farmers formed {{associations}} {{to demand}} the three Fs: fair rent, fixity of tenure, and free sale. In the 1870s, the Fenians tried to organise the tenant farmers in County Mayo to resist eviction. They mounted a demonstration against a local landlord in Irishtown and succeeded in getting him to <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> rents.|$|E
5|$|Johnson played college {{football}} at Morris Brown College in Atlanta. In {{his last year}} at Morris Brown he had 112 tackles and 28 sacks. However his size and the small school he played for helped <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> draft stock. He was projected to go anywhere from the first to fourth rounds prior to the NFL Draft.|$|E
5|$|Accounts vary, but historians {{estimate}} that by spring 1903, between 700 and 1,000 men {{arrived in the}} Tanana Valley. This put an enormous strain on Barnette's stock of food, which rapidly rose in price with demand. Miners objected to Barnette charging $12 per bag of flour and requiring them to buy cases of canned food. They gathered outside his store and demanded he <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> prices or they would burn it down. He responded that he had riflemen inside the building, and both groups reached a compromise. Shortly afterward, Barnette headed south with his wife on a dog team, intending to gather investors to purchase more supplies.|$|E

5|$|Epstein asked {{chartered}} accountant James Trevor Isherwood {{to set up}} a company to collect Lennon and McCartney's PRS payments—called Lenmac—which he did on 12 May 1964. When he first visited Epstein's office, Isherwood was surprised to learn that Epstein took 25 per cent of the gross income, and not the 10 per cent that he believed most other managers received at that time. All of Epstein's expenses were deducted from his artists' gross income, including office rental, staff wages, travel, telephone costs, and entertaining expenses. Before his death, Epstein knew that the renegotiation of his management contract (up for renewal on 30 September 1967), would <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> management fee from 25 to 10 per cent, and that NEMS would no longer receive a share of the Beatles' performance fees, reducing its revenues still further.|$|E
5|$|In the 1500m, Talbot {{decided that}} Windle would {{attack from the}} outset and attempt to hang on in the latter stages of the race. They also worked on Windle's technique, curing his habit of {{dropping}} his elbow to a lower position when he was tired. Windle broke the Olympic record in the heats {{with a time of}} 17min 15.9s to qualify fastest for the final by more than six seconds. In the final, Windle repeated the strategy of sprinting from the start, leading throughout to <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> own Olympic record to 17min 1.7s and holding off American John Nelson by 1.3s. Windle's tactics disrupted the raceplan of the Americans; Nelson and world record holder Roy Saari had planned to pace each other throughout the race, but ended up reacting to Windle instead of swimming their own race. As a result, Saari finished in seventh place, far outside his global standard.|$|E
25|$|Hagino {{made his}} {{international}} breakthrough at the 2012 Olympics held in London. Hagino qualified First in the 400 m individual medley heats {{with a new}} Asian record of 4:10.01, and {{would go on to}} win his first international medal with a bronze in the event and again <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> Asian record to a 4:08.94.|$|E

25|$|The {{criminal}} offence of scandalizing {{the court is}} committed by any act done or writing published calculated to bring a court or a judge of the court into contempt, or to <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> authority. Any publication which alleges bias, lack of impartiality, impropriety or any wrongdoing concerning a judge {{in the exercise of}} his judicial function falls within the offence of scandalizing the court in Singapore.|$|E
25|$|In 1883, George was ill and William Snook won {{the mile}} championship, though George {{recovered}} to <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> amateur record for 10 miles. The next year, George sought revenge on Snook, as they met on 21 June at the Astor Lower Grounds in Birmingham for the AAA championships. George prevailied {{in the race}} at 4:18, setting his third amateur mile record in the process.|$|E
25|$|As {{a sophomore}} in 1992, {{at the age}} of 15 years, Moss joined the track & field team and was the West Virginia state {{champion}} in the 100 and 200 meters with times of 10.94 seconds and 21.95 seconds, respectively. This was the only year he competed on the school's track team, but he would later join the Marshall track team and <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> 200 m time to 21.15 seconds. He also played center field for the baseball team.|$|E

25|$|The {{courtship}} process {{starts with}} the male vocally advertising his abilities with continuous calling. He will try to attract multiple females. In Tinamus species the male will <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> chest to the ground, stretch his neck forward, and fluff up his back to appear larger than normal. When observed head on, all of the bird's back is in view while the under-tail coverts are exposed, a pose {{similar to that used}} by the rhea. The female will scratch her feet on the ground as part of the ritual.|$|E
25|$|Jackson and Williams (1985) {{proposed}} {{that if someone}} feels that others in the group are slacking or that others will slack, he will <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> effort to match that of the others. This can occur whether {{it is apparent that}} the others are slacking or if someone simply believes that the group is slacking. For example, in the Latane et al. study above, if a participant heard the others making less noise than anticipated, he could have lowered his effort in an attempt to equal that of the others, rather than aiming for the optimum.|$|E
25|$|Another legend {{claims that}} {{following}} the Navigation Acts (a 1651 ordinance by Oliver Cromwell requiring all foreign fleets in the North Sea or the Channel to dip their flag in salute) the Wilhelmus was sung (or rather, shouted) by the sailors on the Dutch flagship Brederode {{in response to}} the first warning shot fired by an English fleet under Robert Blake, when their captain Maarten Tromp refused to <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> flag. At the end of the song, which coincided with the third (i.e. last) English warning shot, Tromp fired a full broadside thereby beginning the Battle of Goodwin Sands and the First Anglo-Dutch War.|$|E

25|$|After being outrighted by the Rangers, McCarthy {{signed as}} a free agent with the Oakland Athletics on December 14, 2010 for one year and $1 million. As part of the {{starting}} pitcher rotation for the Athletics in 2011, McCarthy strengthened his mechanics and had his most productive major league season, pitching twenty-five games, five complete. He adapted his pitch repertoire to emphasize two-seam fastballs and cutters, which helped increase his ground-ball percentage and <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> home-run rate while developing control and limiting walks allowed. McCarthy finished the year with the lowest FIP among American League starters. He signed a one-year contract worth $4.275million with the Athletics for the 2012 season, avoiding salary arbitration.|$|E
25|$|A {{year and}} a half after Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, Nora {{contracts}} a fatal illness, while Fries works on a freeze ray for GothCorp. Fries' boss Ferris Boyle decides to tell the mob about the gun, leading Batman to create a team of specialists to help him do his job better. Fries decides to use the device on Nora, to put her in cryo-stasis. His boss interrupts and tampers with the experiment, however, resulting in an explosion that kills Nora. Fries survives, but the chemicals in the freeze ray <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> body temperature to the point that he must wear a cryogenic suit in order to survive. He swears revenge on those responsible for the death of his wife (whom he talks to often), and becomes Mr. Freeze, the first supervillain Batman faces in this continuity.|$|E
25|$|Paramedics arrived {{quickly and}} began resuscitating Viflic. Hamas militants {{launched}} a mortar barrage timed {{to coincide with}} the arrival of paramedics, and medics attending to Viflic had to work under heavy mortar fire. Mortar fire delayed Viflic's evacuation. He was airlifted in critical condition to Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba, where he was placed in the pediatric intensive care unit. Shortly afterward, his brain stopped functioning. Following an initial brain scan, doctors concluded that he had sustained a permanent brain injury. Doctors tried every treatment for cases of severe head trauma such as medication, special respiratory therapy, and attempts to <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> body temperature. Viflic remained in a coma on life support, showing no evidence of any brain activity. His condition was upgraded to extremely critical on 12 April. Viflic died on 17 April, ten days after the attack, {{as a result of a}} severe brain injury.|$|E

25|$|Jersey Shore's {{location}} on the West Branch Susquehanna River, just downstream {{from the mouth of}} Pine Creek made it an ideal location for traders and other businessmen who outfitted the pioneers who settled the western most portions of the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley and the Pine Creek valley. Thomas Martin was a farmer who sold his produce to the people of Jersey Shore and to {{the men and women who}} were just passing through. Mr. Martin was noted for his strong beliefs regarding the prices that he set. For example, if he believed that his potatoes were worth 35 cents a bushel, he would sell them for 35 cents a bushel, no more no less. If his competitors would sell potatoes for 50 cents a bushel, Martin would not raise his price and if others lowered the price to 25 cents per bushel, he would not <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> price. This firmness and fairness allowed Thomas Martin to rise to a position of prominence in Jersey Shore and Lycoming County. His reputation for fairness and honesty was passed onto his son Lewis Martin who went on to serve as a Lycoming County prothonotary and as a deputy U.S. Marshal.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt was {{a member}} of the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 21st D.) in 1882, 1883 and 1884. He {{immediately}} began making his mark, specifically in corporate corruption issues. He blocked a corrupt effort by financier Jay Gould to <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> taxes. Roosevelt exposed suspected collusion in the matter by Judge Theodore Westbrook, and argued for and received approval for an investigation to proceed, aiming for the impeachment of the judge. The investigation committee rejected impeachment, but Roosevelt had exposed the potential corruption in Albany, and thus assumed a high and positive political profile in multiple New York publications. Roosevelt's anti-corruption efforts helped him win re-election in 1882 by a margin greater than two-to-one, an achievement made even more impressive by the fact that Democratic gubernatorial candidate Grover Cleveland won Roosevelt's district. With Conkling's Stalwart faction of the Republican Party in disarray following the assassination of President James Garfield, Roosevelt won election as the Republican party leader in the state assembly. He allied with Governor Cleveland to win passage of a civil service reform bill. Roosevelt won re-election a second time, and sought the office of Speaker of the New York State Assembly, but was defeated by Titus Sheard in a 41 to 29 vote of the GOP caucus. In his final term, Roosevelt served as Chairman of the Committee on Affairs of Cities; he wrote more bills than any other legislator.|$|E
25|$|After reuniting, {{the party}} finally reaches Alent. Here, Justin meets Liete in person, who reveals {{to him that}} his stone is {{actually}} an ancient artifact forged by the Icarians, a race of powerful sorcerers who lived during the Angelou era, and was {{a gift to the}} humans who lived at the time to use as they pleased to bring prosperity, but when they became corrupted by dark desires, it instead gave birth to Gaia, who nearly destroyed the world. The Icarians sacrificed themselves to save the planet and humanity, and enacted a spell that two of their kind would be born into the world should Gaia ever be revived, destined to also sacrifice themselves to save the world until the next revival in an endless loop. Realizing Feena and Leen are the current revival of the Icarians, Justin sets off to save them from the Gaia-fused Baal, who now faces mutiny among his troops, including his son Mullen. With Gaia proving more than a match for the entire Garlyle army, Leen accepts her destiny and sacrifices herself to <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> defenses. Although Mullen pleads with Feena to finish Gaia, Justin argues that the problem can't be solved with more sacrifice since Gaia will just revive later. Thus Gaia must be defeated outright to end the cycle. Though Gaia defeats the troops and spreads its corruption around the planet, Justin is able to sum up the courage to face the evil with help from his friends, and travels to the underground heart of Gaia itself to destroy it and the Spirit Stone once and for all. With Gaia defeated permanently, the world experiences a new age of peace. Leen is also restored to life with Gaia's destruction. In an epilogue ten years later, Sue, now a teenager, re-unites with Justin and Feena who arrive home after nearly a decade of adventure, with children in tow.|$|E
