40|$|Abstract—An {{experiment}} {{was conducted on}} the comparative study of drip and <b>furrow</b> irrigation <b>methods</b> at the farmer’s field in Umar Kot. The total area under experiment about 4000 m 2 was divided into two equal portions. One portion about 40 m X 50 m was occupied by drip and the other portion about 40 m X 50 m by <b>furrow</b> irrigation <b>method.</b> Soil at the experimental site was clay loam in texture for 0 - 60 cm depth; average dry bulk density and field capacity was 1. 16 g/cm 3 and 28. 5 % respectively. The results reveal that the drip irrigation method saved 56. 4 % water and gave 22 % more yield as compared to that of <b>furrow</b> irrigation <b>method.</b> Higher water use efficiency about 4. 87 was obtained in drip irrigation method; whereas lower water used efficiency about 1. 66 was obtained in <b>furrow</b> irrigation <b>method.</b> The present study suggests farming community to adopt drip irrigation method instead of old traditional flooding <b>methods.</b> Keywords—Drip and <b>furrow</b> irrigations <b>methods,</b> water saving, yield of tomato crop...|$|R
40|$|Water {{has been}} {{identified}} as one of the scarce inputs, which can severely restrict agricultural production and productivity unless it is carefully conserved and managed. It is a wide-ranging practice using every drop of water for crop production through suitable irrigation practices. Hence, a field experiment was conducted at Axum area (Northern Ethiopia) during the dry season of 2013 to 2014 using drip and <b>furrow</b> <b>methods</b> of irrigation to evaluate the effect of irrigation methods in combination with and without deficit irrigation practices on yield and water use efficiency (WUE) of onion under drip and surface method of irrigation. Four irrigation treatments viz., drip irrigation at 100, 80 and 60 % crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and full furrow irrigation. Drip irrigation at 100 % ETc gave significantly higher onion yield (28. 0 t ha- 1), as compared to 80 and 60 % ETc and furrow irrigation treatments. The onion irrigated at 100 % ETc with drip method also registered 32. 8 % of increase in yield over <b>furrow</b> <b>method</b> of irrigation. However, irrigation water use efficiency was found highest (7. 60 kg m- 3) with drip irrigation at 60 % ETc and lowest (4. 75 kg m- 3) with furrow irrigation. The amount of water saved at 100, 80 and 60 % ETc under drip method was 29. 4, 43. 5 and 57. 6 % respectively over <b>furrow</b> <b>method</b> and this would be sufficient to irrigate 0. 42 to 1. 36 a hectare of additional area of onion crop in which this earns better economic returns as compared to that of <b>furrow</b> irrigation <b>method.</b> Therefore, the study suggests farmers in the semi-arid conditions, having limited amount of water for irrigation, should adopt drip irrigation method instead of surface irrigation methods...|$|R

This paper describes status of wahoo resource caught by tuna <b>long</b> <b>line</b> in Indian Ocean based at Benoa-Bali. Data obtained from onboard observer program on the tuna long liner based at Benoa-Bali during 2005 - 2010. Total of 85 trips of onboard observation were carried out with the total <b>long</b> <b>line</b> sets (one set per day) were 2873 times. The data covered the horizontal and vertical position of tuna <b>long</b> <b>line</b> hooks caught the wahoo, hook rate and fish size distribution. Data of horizontal fishing positions (coordinates) gained from the global positioning system availabled in the tuna long liners. The depth of the <b>long</b> <b>line</b> gear in the waters and teperature of waters were measured by mini-loggers TDR type SP 2 T- 1200, brand: NKE Micrel.

A split plot experiment with three main treatments (irrigation methods) and two sub-main treatments (irrigation water qualities) with four replications were designed and executed in Marvdasht sewage station.

Based on the results, the corns, irrigated by <b>furrow</b> irrigation <b>method</b> showed higher protein and oil contents than those irrigated by other methods.
