40|$|In {{previous}} work, {{we showed}} that two-step biomass pyrolysis, consisting of a first low temperature step (T = 360 _C, so a <b>low</b> actual <b>heating</b> rate) <b>until</b> the mass loss of the solid reached approximately 50 %, followed rapidly by a high temperature step (T > 600 _C, so a high actual heating rate) led to optimize charcoal yields with values of up to 40 %. In this paper, we describe thermogravimetric analysis studies on eucalyptus wood and its three constituents, i. e. cellulose, xylan and lignin, in order to explain the phenomena behind these results. Two-step pyrolysis experiments were conducted in a TGA oven up to 900 _C with a first slow pyrolysis step at a <b>low</b> <b>heating</b> rate of 2 _Cmin_ 1, followed by a fast pyrolysis step with a heating rate of 100 _C min_ 1. Char yields from eucalyptus wood were increased from 18. 8 %, for the simple 2 _C min_ 1 pyrolysis, up to 22. 8 % when the heating rate change was operated at a temperature of 360 _C. Char yield from cellulose was also increased, though only very slightly, when the heating rate was changed in the 330 - 360 _C temperature range. Conversely, char yield obtained from xylan and lignin in two-step pyrolysis was always lower than that obtained by simple 2 _C min_ 1 pyrolysis. It appeared from this work that two-step pyrolysis of the eucalyptus sample could not be regarded and described {{as the result of}} the sum of the pyrolysis of its constituents. There was a matrix effect with interactions that promoted char formation during two-step pyrolysis. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|The family Poxviridae {{consists}} of large double-stranded DNA containing viruses that replicate {{exclusively in the}} cytoplasm of infected cells. Members of the orthopox genus include variola, the causative agent of human small pox, monkeypox, and vaccinia (VAC), the prototypic member of the virus family. Within the relatively large (~ 200 kb) vaccinia genome, three classes of genes are encoded: early, intermediate, and late. While all three classes are transcribed by virally-encoded RNA polymerases, each class serves a different function in {{the life cycle of}} the virus. Poxviruses utilize multiple strategies for modulation of the host cellular environment during infection. In order to understand regulation of both host and virus gene expression, we have utilized genome-wide approaches to analyze transcript abundance from both virus and host cells. Here, we demonstrate time course infections of HeLa cells with Vaccinia virus and sampling RNA at several time points post-infection. Both host and viral total RNA is isolated and amplified for hybridization to microarrays for analysis of gene expression. Protocol Part 1 : aRNA labeling: amino allyl coupling of the dyes 1.

50|$|The term {{rillette}} perhaps {{refers to}} the final product and its appearance when spread on sliced bread. Rillettes were traditionally made with fatty pork belly or pork shoulder. The meat was cubed, salted and cured, cooked slowly over <b>low</b> <b>heat</b> <b>until</b> very tender, then raked into small shreds and blended with the warm cooking fat to form a rustic paste. Rillettes could be stored in crocks for several months. In Anjou, rillaud was a speciality, plated {{in the shape of}} a pyramid and topped with the pig's tail; the rillettes were proudly displayed to the guest of honor. In time the rillette cooking style was applied to game birds, wild rabbit, and fish. Eventually several preparations for seafood rillettes were developed including an anchovy, tuna, and salmon version. Though the fish is not actually cooked in the fat, it is blended with fat to form the characteristic paste-spread. The soft, smooth texture is a deciding factor in determining a good rillette dish.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the typical}} kuku sabzi recipe (as pictured), {{the eggs and}} herbs are mixed and {{seasoned}} with salt, black pepper, walnuts, sometimes flour, sometime barberries, sometimes baking powder and ground turmeric or adviyeh spice mixture. The mixture is then poured into a preheated oiled pan, covered and cooked over <b>low</b> <b>heat</b> <b>until</b> set, sometimes flipped or finished in a hot oven. Some cooks saute the herbs briefly before adding the eggs. The amount of herb ingredient usually greatly exceeds the amount of egg, the egg merely serving to hold the kuku together, making the predominant flavor that of the herbs rather {{than that of a}} typical [...] "egg omelette." [...] Walnuts and zereshk (barberries) are a favorite garnish for on top. It is often sliced and served hot or cold with bread or rice, yogurt, sabzi khordan (platter of fresh herbs) and torshi (pickled vegetables). Kuku can be a main dish or an appetizer.|$|E
50|$|In Fiji curries {{are made}} in most Indian homes and are eaten with rice or roti. Roti (circle or square) is mainly eaten for breakfast with {{vegetable}} curries. Lunch is often dal and rice with some side dishes. Most working people take roti and curry for their lunch. Dinner is usually curry, rice with some chutneys. Curries are normally cooked in vegetable oil. Ghee is mainly used to fry dal, to make puris or sweets. To make a curry, spices like cumin, fenugreek, mustard, and curry leaves {{are added to the}} hot oil. Onion is chopped or sliced and garlic crushed and added to the pot. Once the onion and garlic have turned slightly golden then turmeric and garam masala are added. For every 1 tsp turmeric normally 2 tsp masala is added. Salt and chillies are added according to taste. Curry is simmered on <b>low</b> <b>heat</b> <b>until</b> well cooked. Water is added {{so that it can be}} mixed with rice. If coriander leaves are available then they are added for extra flavour.|$|E

5000|$|Pé de moleque (...) (literally [...] "boy's foot" [...] in Portuguese) is a {{traditional}} candy from the Brazilian cuisine made of peanuts and jaggery or molasses. The origin of its name {{lies in the fact}} that most paved streets of colonial Brazil were made by laying down various odd rocks in a loose layer of sand, and having street children stomp on them to flatten the surface. While cobblestone streets are called rua de paralelepípedos and unpaved streets rua de barro (literally, [...] "clay street"), those made by the method described above came to be named pé de moleque. Since the appearance of the peanuts stuck together by molasses was found to be similar to that of these type of street, the candy took the same name.The candy is prepared by mixing roasted, peeled peanuts with melted brown sugar or rapadura, with or without the addition of macerated peanuts as well. The mixture is gently stirred over <b>low</b> <b>heat</b> <b>until</b> it gets close to crystallizing. Then the mixture is placed on a plain stone or metal surface (preferably thinly oiled with butter to ease removal) in pieces similar in size to cookies. This traditional preparation results in soft, irregularly-shaped sweets of a dark brown color. Softness results from the incorporation of peanut oil.|$|E
30|$|The {{heat flow}} value is {{generally}} {{dependent on the}} age of the incoming plate (Stein and Stein 1992). The advection of the subducting plate results in substantially reduced heat flow from the margin wedge and forearc relative to the incoming plate. There are locally high or <b>low</b> <b>heat</b> flow observations superimposed on the regionally <b>low</b> <b>heat</b> flow on the wedge and forearc. These are thought to be mainly due to advective fluid flows (e.g., Wang et al. 1993, 1995), rapid sedimentation or erosion (Hutchison 1985; Wang et al. 1993), or fault activity (e.g., Kinoshita et al. 2011). In addition, topographic effects that arise in convex-upward and convex-downward topographies also cause locally high or <b>low</b> <b>heat</b> flows (Ganguly et al. 2000; Chen et al. 2014; Li et al. 2014). Identifying the phenomena that cause local high or <b>low</b> <b>heat</b> flows is important because surface measurements of heat flow are utilized to estimate thermal properties in plate subduction zones, including frictional strength along plate boundaries and radioactive heat production.|$|R
