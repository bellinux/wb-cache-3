5|$|Before leaving office, Mahathir had {{condemned}} Malays who {{relied on}} their privileges. Abdullah continued this, warning Malays to <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> without crutches or {{end up in}} wheelchairs. His administration began the practice of meritocracy, which Mahathir had tentatively proposed, and university admissions quotas were eliminated. However, some charged that this did not eliminate discrimination in education. The pre-university stream was divided into two; one course prepared students for the Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia (STPM) standardised examination, lasting two years, while the other comprised various matriculation courses graded by individual lecturers, typically lasting a year.|$|E

25|$|To {{the jurors}} who voted to acquit him, Socrates gives encouragement: his supernatural daimonion did not {{interfere}} with his conduct of the legal defence, which he viewed {{as a sign that}} such a defence was the correct action. In that way, the daimonion communicated to Socrates that death might be a good thing; either death is annihilation (release from earthly worry) and not to be feared, or death is migration (higher plane of existence) in which reside the souls of personages and heroes, such as Hesiod and Homer and Odysseus. Socrates concludes his self-defence by saying to the court that he bears no ill-will, neither towards his accusers — Lycon, Anytus, and Meletus — nor the jurors. He asks that they ensure the well-being of his three sons, so that they <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> ethically.|$|E
25|$|The {{worst case}} is a full {{resurgence}} of SARS could {{come back in the}} places it hit before—such as China, Taiwan, Canada, and Singapore—or hit harder in other well-connected places like the United States, Japan, Europe, India, or Brazil.

The return of SARS to Asia is likely to cause somewhat less disruption the second time as citizens <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with the disease, but more multinational companies probably would reduce their exposure in the region if they concluded that SARS posed a long-term health challenge. Bigger outbreaks in Europe or the United States would hit {{a whole new set of}} business and government players, potentially doing serious damage to trade and growth.|$|E

500|$|According to Crowley's later statements, on 8 April {{he heard}} a disembodied voice that claimed {{to be that of}} Aiwass, the {{messenger}} of Horus, or Hoor-Paar-Kraat. Crowley said that he wrote down everything the voice told him {{over the course of the}} next three days, and titled it Liber L vel Legis or The Book of the Law. The book proclaimed that humanity was entering a new Aeon, and that Crowley would serve as its prophet. It stated that a supreme moral law was to be introduced in this Aeon, [...] "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law," [...] and that people should <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in tune with their Will. This book, and the philosophy that it espoused, became the cornerstone of Crowley's religion, Thelema. Crowley said that at the time he had been unsure what to do with The Book of the Law. Often resenting it, he said that he ignored the instructions which the text commanded him to perform, which included taking the Stele of Revealing from the museum, fortifying his own island, and translating the book into all the world's languages. According to his account, he instead sent typescripts of the work to several occultists he knew, putting the manuscript away and ignoring it.|$|E
500|$|The story {{takes place}} in a fictional {{universe}} where humans live in harmony with gods, resembling humans with slightly pointed ears, and devils (demons in the English dub of the anime), who have more prominently pointed ears. Despite their respective positive and negative connotations, both races are equally kind and good-natured. Ten years prior to the story, the gateway between the worlds of the gods and devils were opened, and since then, people from all races have been immigrating between the worlds. The characters attend the multi-racial high school, [...] in [...] This is so humans, gods and devils can interact and <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> together in harmony with mutual understanding rather than hatred, fear and ignorance. Also, due to dimensional tears (unknown why or how they appear) some members of each race had been transported to one of the other worlds where they married and had children. This is how some of the students with mixed lineage are able to be older than the gateway to the human world like Mayumi Thyme, whose human parent had fallen into the world of the Devils through one of those tears years before the gateway to the Human world had been opened, or Asa's mother, Ama Shigure, who somehow was transported from the world of the Devils to the Human world.|$|E

500|$|Fabulous Histories (later {{known as}} The Story of the Robins), Trimmer's most popular work, was first {{published}} in 1786, and remained in print until the beginning of the 20th century. It tells the story of two families, a robin family and a human family, who <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> together congenially. Most importantly, the human children and the baby robins must learn to adopt virtue and to shun vice. For Trimmer, practising kindness to animals as a child would hopefully lead one to [...] "universal benevolence" [...] as an adult. According to Samuel Pickering, Jr., a scholar of 18th-century children's literature, [...] "in its depiction of 18th-century attitudes toward animals, Mrs. Trimmer’s Fabulous Histories was the most representative children’s book of the period". [...] The text expresses most of the themes that would come to dominate Trimmer's later works, such as her emphasis on retaining social hierarchies; as Tess Cosslett, a scholar of children's literature explains, [...] "the notion of hierarchy that underpins Fabulous Histories is relatively stable and fixed. Parents are above children in terms of authority, and humans above animals, in terms both of dominion and compassion: poor people should be fed before hungry animals… [...] the hierarchical relation of men and women is not so clearly enforced." [...] Moira Ferguson, a scholar of the 18th and 19th centuries, places these themes in a larger historical context, arguing that [...] "the fears of the author and her class about an industrial revolution in ascendance and its repercussions are evident. Hence, [...] text attacks cruelty to birds and animals while affirming British aggression abroad. [...] …The text subtly opts for conservative solutions: maintenance of order and established values, resignation and compliance from the poor at home, expatriation for foreigners who do not assimilate easily." [...] A second overarching theme in the text is rationality; Trimmer expresses the common fear of the power of fiction in her preface, explaining to her childish readers that her fable is not real and that animals cannot really speak. Like many social critics during the 18th century, Trimmer was concerned about fiction's potentially damaging impact on young readers. With the rise of the novel and its concomitant private reading, there was a great fear that young people and especially women would read racy and adventurous stories without the knowledge of their parents and, perhaps even more worrisome, interpret the books as they pleased. Trimmer therefore always referred to her text as Fabulous Histories and never as The Story of the Robins in order to emphasize its reality; moreover, she did not allow the book to be illustrated within her lifetime—pictures of talking birds would only have reinforced the paradox of the book (it was fiction parading as a history). Yarde has also speculated that most of the characters in the text are drawn from Trimmer's own acquaintances and family.|$|E
