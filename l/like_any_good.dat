Scott {{thought the}} film was [...] "edited crisply enough {{to keep it from}} feeling like 90 minutes of C-SPAN and shaped to give Mr. Gore's argument a real sense of drama," [...] and [...] "as unsettling as it can be," [...] Scott continued, [...] "it is also intellectually exhilarating, and, <b>like</b> <b>any</b> <b>good</b> piece of pedagogy, whets the appetite for further study." ...|$|E

But tourist board employees representing the various Spanish cities flattered in the movie {{are not the only ones}} who will come out grinning.", though he found the movie [...] "stubbornly un-macho" [...] for a buddy film. The National reviewer Kaleem Aftab, in his 4 star review, noted [...] "Throwing together road trip, romcom and buddy-buddy action in a single picture may sound like an ill-conceived masala mash-up, but <b>like</b> <b>any</b> <b>good</b> dish, the ingredients are blended together with affection to create one of the best feel-good movies of the year." ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{are other}} {{officers}} of the tribunal. The promoter of justice, for instance, is a canon lawyer {{whose job is to}} represent the diocese as the prosecutor in penal cases and who also can intervene in contentious cases if they concern the [...] "public good", acting as a watch dog {{for the people of the}} diocese. Another important officer is the defender of the bond, another canon lawyer whose job is to present reasons to the tribunal why a marriage is valid in cases of alleged nullity and why an ordination is valid in the rare cases of alleged nullity of Holy Orders. The tribunal also has notaries who swear in witnesses and commit their testimony to writing. <b>Like</b> <b>any</b> <b>good</b> legal system, parties in a case have the right to appoint an advocate who can argue for them at the tribunal. If a person cannot afford an advocate, the tribunal can assign one to them free of charge.|$|E
2500|$|In {{reviews of}} the 1999 film Bowfinger, some critics {{compared}} the fictional organization [...] "MindHead" [...] to the Church of Scientology. [...] In the film, producer Bobby Bowfinger, played by Steve Martin, encounters difficulties involving actor Kit Ramsey, played by Eddie Murphy. [...] Paul Clinton writes in CNN online: [...] "'Bowfinger' could just {{be viewed as an}} out-there, over-the-top spoof about Hollywood, films, celebrities and even the Church of Scientology. But Martin has written a sweet story about a group of outsiders with impossible dreams." [...] Andrew O'Hehir writes in Salon that [...] "Too much of 'Bowfinger' involves the filmmakers' generically wacky pursuit of the increasingly paranoid Kit, who flees into the clutches of a pseudo-Scientology outfit called MindHead (their slogan: 'Truth Through Strength')." [...] The Denver Post describes the Kit Ramsey character as [...] "...petulant, paranoid and pampered, <b>like</b> <b>any</b> <b>good</b> star, and also a devotee of a Scientology-like religion." [...] In a review in the San Francisco Chronicle, Wesley Morris describes Ramsey's organization as [...] "a mock-Scientology cult called MindHead - a bit that sprung from Martin's own issues with MENSA." [...] The Albuquerque Journal describes the MindHead organization [...] "a rather thinly veiled but nevertheless amusing blast at Scientology," [...] and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram characterizes it as an [...] "organization that comes across as a thinly veiled send-up of Scientology." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reviewing for La Stampa, Mario Gromo {{argued that}} it was a [...] "film of a certain {{importance}} because of its many intelligent moments, its sound portrayal of provincial life, and because it is the second film of a young director who evidently has considerable talent... The Italian film industry now has a new director and one who puts his own personal ideas before any of the customary traditions of the trade. Fellini's is a fresh approach". [...] "It is the atmosphere that counts most in this unusual film," [...] wrote Francesco Càallari of the Gazzetta del Lunedi, [...] "an intensely human and poetical atmosphere altogether estranged from the provincialism of the setting... Fellini has something to say and he says it with an acute sense of observation... Here is someone apart from the other young directors of post-war Italian cinema. Fellini has a magical touch." [...] First published 31 August 1953 in the Gazzeta del Lunedi (Genoa). After praising Fellini's Venice triumph, Ermanno Contini of Il Secolo XIX outlined the film's weaknesses: [...] "I Vitelloni does not have a particularly solid structure, the story is discontinuous, seeking unity through the complex symbiosis of episodes and details... The narrative, built up around strong emotions and powerful situations, lacks solid organic unity, and at times this undermines the story's creative force, resulting in an imbalance of tone and pace and a certain sense of tedium. But such shortcomings are amply atoned for by the film's sincerity and authenticity." [...] Arturo Lanocita of Corriere della Sera wrote: [...] "I Vitelloni gives a graphic and authentic picture of certain aimless evenings, the streets populated by groups of idle youths... The film is a series of annotations, hints, and allusions without unity... With a touch of irony, Fellini tries to show the contrast between the way his characters see themselves and the way they really are. Despite its weaknesses, the film {{is one of the best}} in recent years." [...] For Giulio Cesare Castello of Cinema VI, the film proved [...] "that Fellini is the Italian film industry's most talented satirist, and an acute observer and psychologist of human behaviour. <b>Like</b> <b>any</b> <b>good</b> moralist, he knows how to give his story a meaning, to provide more than just simple entertainment".|$|E

6000|$|They {{crossed to}} the farther side of the river, where the {{influence}} of the Gothic monument threw a distinction even over the Parisian smartnesses--the municipal rule and measure, the importunate symmetries, the [...] "handsomeness" [...] of everything, the extravagance of gaslight, the perpetual click on the neat bridges. In front of a quiet little café on the left bank Gabriel Nash said, [...] "Let's sit down"--he was always ready to sit down. It was a friendly establishment and an unfashionable quarter, far away from the caravan-series; there were the usual little tables and chairs on the quay, the muslin curtains behind the glazed front, the general sense of sawdust and of drippings of watery beer. The place was subdued to stillness, but not extinguished, by the lateness of the hour; no vehicles passed, only now and then a light Parisian foot. Beyond the parapet they could hear the flow of the Seine. Nick Dormer said it made him think of the old Paris, of the great Revolution, of Madame Roland, quoi! Gabriel said they could have watery beer but were not obliged to drink it. They sat a long time; they talked a great deal, and the more they said the more the unsaid came up. Presently Nash found occasion to throw out: [...] "I go about my business <b>like</b> <b>any</b> <b>good</b> citizen--that's all." ...|$|E

60|$|With Mr. Moss {{there was}} a double motive, neither of which was very bright, but both of which he {{followed}} with considerable energy. He had at first been attracted by her good looks, which he had desired to make his own--at the cheapest price at which they might be had in the market. If marriage were necessary, so be it, {{but it might be}} that the young lady would not be so exigeant. It was probably the expression of some such feelings {{in the early days of}} their acquaintance which had made him so odious to her. Then Frank Jones had come forward; and <b>like</b> <b>any</b> <b>good</b> honest girl, in a position so public, she had at once let the fact of Mr. Jones be made known, so as to protect her. But it had not protected her, and Mr. Moss had been doubly odious. Then, by degrees, he had become aware of the value of her voice, and he perceived the charms that there were in what he pictured to himself as a professional partnership as well as a marriage. Various ideas floated through his mind, down even to the creation of fresh names, grand married names, for his wife. And if she could be got to see it in the light he saw it, what a stroke of business they might do! He was aware that she expressed personal dislike to him; but he did not think much of that. He did not in the least understand the nature of such dislike as she exhibited. He thought himself to be a very good-looking man. He was one of a profession to which she also belonged. He had no idea that he was not a gentleman but that she was a lady. He did not know that there were such things. Madame Socani told him that this young woman was already married to Mr. Jones, but had left that gentleman because he had no money. He did not believe this; but in any case he would be willing to risk it. The peril would be hers and not his. It was his object to establish the partnership, and he did not even yet see any fatal impediment to it.|$|E

The relationships between transport demand, transport investment and Gross Domestic Product are highlighted and the evidence concerning transport intensity and causation is reviewed. The relationship between transport demand and socio-demographics is also reviewed and the contribution of models at a variety of geographical scales is examined.

Indeed, ICT has led to the creation of virtual trading areas where products, services, and information are sold [27]. Furthermore, due to the on-demand availability of large computing power, high-capacity storage as a service from the cloud, and application service provisioning, completely new categories of goods have emerged, most notably data.
