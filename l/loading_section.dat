The separation section is further divided into two segments: the first conditioned with NH 4 and the second with acid. Erbium is loaded onto both segments of the separation column as a retaining ion. Bands of mixed REE eluting between separated bands of pure REE were recycled directly to the columns. Without mixed-band recycle, over 80 % of the REE eluted from the column was separated into fractions with 99 % purity of each element; with such recycle, the percentage of separated elements can be increased to around 90 %.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{successful}} {{operation of}} a man-pack VHF jamming system requires a compact and efficient antenna operating over a wide bandwidth. The design of such an antenna {{is the focus of}} this thesis. The antenna should be of a practical size for a portable system and it must radiate energy efficiently across a frequency bandwidth in excess of a decade. A practical „target‟ specification of such an antenna has been drawn up based on the performance of a commercially available system. Several possible antenna topologies, each with a variety of <b>loading</b> <b>section</b> options, are tested using “Full wave” electromagnetic modelling (FEKO). Each topology/loading-section is numerically optimised for load element values by considering both its gain and reflection coefficient. Results of the „optimally loaded‟ solution for each topology are then compared to each other to arrive at the best overall design. The best result is found to be the traditional monopole whip-type antenna, with four R-L loading sections spread along its length. The simulated results show that the proposed antenna can be expected to meet the target standing wave ratio (SWR) specifications while offering a gain advantage of between 5 and 10 dBi higher than is available commercially. The selected design is constructed and its performance measured. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die suksesvolle werking van ŉ mobiele VHF "jammer‟ benodig ŉ kompakte antenna met ŉ bruikbare benuttingsgraad wat oor ŉ wyeband funksioneer. Die ontwerp van so ŉ antenna is die fokus van hierdie tesis. Die antenna moet kompak genoeg wees om draagbaar te wees en moet ŉ bruikbare benuttingsgraad hê oor ŉ frekwensie-bandwydte van meer as 10 : 1. ŉ Praktiese spesifikasie is opgestel vir die antenna deur te kyk na die sigblaaie van beskikbare stelsels. “Volgolf” elektromagnetiese modelleringsagteware is daarna gebruik om ŉ parametriese ondersoek te loods van verskillende antennas.

40|$|Husqvarna AB {{operates}} two warehouses {{located in}} the area of Jönköping. The most important task is to manage the large volume fluctuations during the peak season. DHL Exel Supply Chain (DESC) run the warehouses and the domestic transportations is outsourced to DHL Express. A number of forwarder agents are responsible for distributing the export gods. In the present situation a bottleneck occurs at the warehouse <b>loading</b> <b>section,</b> and the consequence is fulfill the time of delivery for all customer orders. The underlying bottleneck cause is also the key question for the thesis. The purpose of the thesis is to investigate the reason why the areas of out loading during peak season becomes a bottleneck in the material flow, and provide relevant solutions for the problem. The thesis study has progressed during normal season, and interviews are the main source of information, with support from observations and statistic data, The order- and material flow process is included for a basic understanding of the situation. The study indicates that the problem is not always related to the physical flow. Instead the critical factor for a third party’s performance is more related to the sharing of information between all divisions. A contribution to the problem is the large volume fluctuations during the year. A more detailed analysis indicates that the warehouse has a problem to handle the volume peaks that occur some of the days. The consequence becomes a difficulty to deliver all orders to the customers at given time. The result of delayed transportation pickups is orders with intention to leave the warehouse, but instead blocking the out loading areas, The transportation companies hired to distribute Husqvarna´s products does not always fulfill the requirements for picking up the orders. The consequence is irregular pick up times, which obstruct the warehouse planning. Another contribution to the bottleneck is traditional booking routines that exist for both domestic and international shipments. The lack of communication and pore statistical data is also connected to the problem. This prevents the opportunity to improve the distribution process. From the problem analysis has a couple of improvements suggestions been discovered. To realize the potential of implementation an activity plan has been created for each suggestion. One of the activities is to create a smoother volume allocation for the flow. Modified routines of booking for pre seasonal orders can generate a better level of volume. An alternative for the problem is to disconnect goods from the areas of loading with help from extra trailer units. The solution will generate a better platform for planning of goods and personnel. Measurements and evaluation of transporters who indicates a defect performance will hopefully lead to a better quality. The future object is that every transport collects goods at the right day and time. To actualize all improvements a working communication will be important between all sections in the supply chain. Regular meetings with a recurring agenda should be held continuously related to the bottle neck. When all suggestions are implemented hopefully all Husqvarna´s order will be able to leave the loading area at the given time, regardless day of the year...|$|E
40|$|Magnesium alloys {{have been}} of growing {{interest}} to various engineering applications, such as the automobile, aerospace, communication and computer industries due to their low density, high specific strength, good machineability and availability as compared with other structural materials. However, most Mg alloys suffer from poor plasticity due to their Hexagonal Close Packed structure. Grain refinement has been {{proved to be an}} effective method to enhance the strength and alter the ductility of the materials. Several methods have been proposed to produce materials with nanocrystalline grain structures. So far, most of the research work on nanocrystalline materials has been carried out on Face-Centered Cubic and Body-Centered Cubic metals. However, there has been little investigation of nanocrystalline Mg alloys. In this study, bulk coarse-grained and nanocrystalline Mg alloys were fabricated by a mechanical alloying method. The mixed powder of Mg chips and Al powder was mechanically milled under argon atmosphere for different durations of 0 hours (MA 0), 10 hours (MA 10), 20 hours (MA 20), 30 hours (MA 30) and 40 hours (MA 40), followed by compaction and sintering. Then the sintered billets were hot-extruded into metallic rods with a 7 mm diameter. The obtained Mg alloys have a nominal composition of Mg– 5 wt% Al, with grain sizes ranging from 13 μm down to 50 nm, depending on the milling durations. The microstructure characterization and evolution after deformation were carried out by means of Optical microscopy, X-Ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy, Scanning Probe Microscopy and Neutron Diffraction techniques. Nanoindentaion, compression and micro-compression tests on micro-pillars were used to study the size effects on the mechanical behaviour of the Mg alloys. Two kinds of size effects on the mechanical behaviours and deformation mechanisms were investigated: grain size effect and sample size effect. The nanoindentation tests were composed of constant strain rate, constant loading rate and indentation creep tests. The normally reported indentation size effect in single crystal and coarse-grained crystals was observed in both the coarse-grained and nanocrystalline Mg alloys. Since the indentation size effect is correlated to the Geometrically Necessary Dislocations under the indenter to accommodate the plastic deformation, the good agreement between the experimental results and the Indentation Size Effect model indicated that, in the current nanocrystalline MA 20 and MA 30, the dislocation plasticity was still the dominant deformation mechanism. Significant hardness enhancement with decreasing grain size, down to 58 nm, was found in the nanocrystalline Mg alloys. Further reduction of grain size would lead to a drop in the hardness values. The failure of grain refinement strengthening with the relatively high strain rate sensitivity of nanocrystalline Mg alloys suggested a change in the deformation mechanism. Indentation creep tests showed that the stress exponent was dependent on the loading rate during the <b>loading</b> <b>section</b> of the indentation, which was related to the dislocation structures before the creep starts. The influence of grain size on the mechanical behaviour and strength of extruded coarse-grained and nanocrystalline Mg alloys were investigated using uniaxial compression tests. The macroscopic response of the Mg alloys transited from strain hardening to strain softening behaviour, with grain size reduced from 13 ìm to 50 nm. The strain hardening was related to the twinning induced hardening and dislocation hardening effect, while the strain softening was attributed to the localized deformation in the nanocrystalline grains. The tension–compression yield asymmetry was noticed in the nanocrystalline region, demonstrating the twinning effect in the ultra-fine-grained and nanocrystalline region. The relationship k tensions < k compression failed in the nanocrystalline Mg alloys; this was attributed to the twofold effect of grain size on twinning. The nanocrystalline Mg alloys were found to exhibit increased strain rate sensitivity with decreasing grain size, with strain rate ranging from 0. 0001 /s to 0. 01 /s. Strain rate sensitivity of coarse-grained MA 0 was increased by more than 10 times in MA 40. The Hall-Petch relationship broke down at a critical grain size in the nanocrystalline region. The breakdown of the Hall-Petch relationship and the increased strain rate sensitivity were due to the localized dislocation activities (generalization and annihilation at grain boundaries) and the more significant contribution from grain boundary mediated mechanisms. In the micro-compression tests, the sample size effects on the mechanical behaviours were studied on MA 0, MA 20 and MA 40 micro-pillars. In contrast to the bulk samples under compression, the stress-strain curves of MA 0 and MA 20 micro-pillars were characterized with a number of discrete strain burst events separated by nearly elastic strain segments. Unlike MA 0 and MA 20, the stress-strain curves of MA 40 micro-pillars were smooth, without obvious strain bursts. The deformation mechanisms of the MA 0 and MA 20 micro-pillars under micro-compression tests were considered to be initially dominated by deformation twinning, followed by dislocation mechanisms. For MA 40 pillars, the deformation mechanisms were believed to be localized dislocation activities and grain boundary related mechanisms. The strain hardening behaviours of the micro-pillars suggested that the grain boundaries in the nanocrystalline micro-pillars would reduce the source (nucleation sources for twins/dislocations) starvation hardening effect. The power law relationship of the yield strength on pillar dimensions in MA 0, MA 20 supported the fact that the twinning mechanism was correlated to the pre-existing defects, which can promote the nucleation of the twins. Then, we provided a latitudinal comparison of the results and conclusions derived from the different techniques used for testing the coarse-grained and nanocrystalline Mg alloy; this helps to better understand the deformation mechanisms of the Mg alloys as a whole. At the end, we summarized the thesis and highlighted the conclusions, contributions, innovations and outcomes of the research. Finally, it outlined recommendations for future work...|$|E
