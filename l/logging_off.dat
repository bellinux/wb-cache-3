2500|$|On April 26, 1986, MacDougall {{worked at}} his shop as normal, and closed at 4:00p.m. EST. After eating dinner, he {{reported}} to Central Florida Teleport with one other engineer on duty. The second engineer left at 6:00p.m., leaving MacDougall {{to operate the}} building on his own. MacDougall oversaw the uplink of the movie Pee-wee's Big Adventure {{as part of the}} evening's programming for the pay-per-view network People's Choice, which used Central Florida Teleport's facilities. After the film ended, he went through his regular routine. Before <b>logging</b> <b>off,</b> MacDougall set up SMPTE color bars and punched buttons on a Microgen MG-100 character generator that placed letters on the television screen. He spent a couple of minutes composing his message. MacDougall began his message with a polite greeting as he did not wish to be insulting. He selected the name [...] "Captain Midnight" [...] from a film he had recently seen: On the Air Live with Captain Midnight (not associated with the popular Captain Midnight radio show of the 1940s).|$|E

50|$|One area of {{particular}} note is performance. Areas of improvement include file copy operations, hibernation, <b>logging</b> <b>off</b> on domain-joined machines, JavaScript parsing in Internet Explorer, network file share browsing, Windows Explorer ZIP file handling, and Windows Disk Defragmenter. The ability to choose individual drives to defragment is being reintroduced as well.|$|E

50|$|SteadyState {{can prepare}} user environments. User {{accounts}} can be locked or forced to <b>log</b> <b>off</b> after certain intervals. A locked account uses a temporary {{copy of the}} user's profile during the user's session. When the user <b>logs</b> <b>off,</b> the temporary profile is deleted. This ensures that any changes the user made during his session are not permanent.|$|R
5000|$|Accepting the new {{package and}} {{assigning}} the GPO to the relevant Organizational Unit (OU) will publish the application. The user(s) will then need to reload the group policy from the server which manages GPO.

5000|$|Note that nohupping backgrounded jobs is {{typically}} used to avoid terminating them when <b>logging</b> <b>off</b> from a remote SSH session.

50|$|Further, if a roaming user uses standby or {{hibernation}} to {{turn off}} the computer at night, their profile is still not copied to the network. In this manner it is possible for a roaming account's documents to not be backed up for days to weeks at a time, and there is the potential for considerable data loss if the local hard drive suffers a catastrophic failure during these long periods of not <b>logging</b> <b>off</b> the roaming account from the local computer.|$|E

5000|$|The {{railroad}} reported 268 mi (operating miles) in 1886, {{with the}} most significant addition being the Saginaw & Western's 42 mi branch from Howard City to Alma, which provided an interchange with the Toledo, Ann Arbor and North Michigan Railroad. The freight traffic was overwhelmingly (62%) lumber and forest products, as the <b>logging</b> <b>off</b> of Michigan's old-growth forest continued to accelerate thanks to mechanization. A conversion to automatic couplers, mandated by an 1885 state law, was underway, and Westinghouse air brakes had appeared.|$|E
5000|$|Transport Layer streams {{could not}} {{take place at the}} same time as file transfers, so in general terms the {{applications}} using the Transport Layer were fairly modal. For instance, CIS Navigator for the Mac, which was HMI based, allowed users to navigate CIS offline, setting up various e-mail and file transfers which would then be carried out in a single batch in order to reduce online time. The last step of the Navigator [...] "run" [...] would be to download files before <b>logging</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
50|$|Log4j can be {{configured}} {{through a}} configuration file or through Java code. Configuration files {{can be written}} in XML, JSON, YAML, or properties file format. Within a configuration you can define three main components: Loggers, Appenders and Layouts. Configuring logging via a file has the advantage that logging can be turned on or off without modifying the application that uses Log4j. The application can be allowed to run with <b>logging</b> <b>off</b> until there's a problem, for example, and then logging can be turned back on simply by modifying the configuration file.|$|E

50|$|The {{most recent}} {{version of a}} file in a roaming profile without {{redirection}} is stored only on the local computer, and stays there until the user <b>logs</b> <b>off,</b> whereupon it transfers to the server. If nightly server backups are done, and a roaming user does not <b>log</b> <b>off</b> {{for days at a}} time, their roaming account documents are not being included in the nightly backup.|$|R
5000|$|Microsoft {{offers a}} utility called Desktops which allows users running Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 or later {{operating}} systems to run applications {{on up to}} 4 virtual desktops. Unlike nearly all other virtual desktop solutions for Windows, this utility actually uses native [...] "desktop objects," [...] as discussed above. Because of this, it does not offer {{the ability to move}} programs between desktops, or in fact to stop using virtual desktops at all, short of <b>logging</b> <b>off,</b> and Windows Aero only works on the primary desktop object.|$|E
5000|$|The Task Manager {{has also}} been made less {{vulnerable}} to attack from remote sources or viruses as it must be operating under administrative rights to carry out certain tasks, such as <b>logging</b> <b>off</b> other connected users or sending messages. The user must go into the [...] "Processes" [...] tab and click [...] "Show processes from other users" [...] in order to verify administrative rights and unlock these privileges. Showing processes from all users requires all users including administrators to accept a UAC prompt, unless UAC is disabled. If the user is not an administrator, they must enter a password for an administrator account when prompted to proceed, unless UAC is disabled, {{in which case the}} elevation does not occur.|$|E
5000|$|In {{their final}} year of college (2006), Emily and the {{character}} have clearly grown apart. Emily comments how her life is better now; she started dating Brad/Travis again and is involved in other things. The player themselves have lost their friend Emma, in some cases because of Emily. As the conversation comes to an uncomfortable and cold finish, the character begins to revise sentences asking if the two will {{ever be the same}} - deleting earnest questions and asking about the weather or other mundane affairs instead. Despite the protagonist's obvious feelings for Emily, she obviously no longer cares, and as a result, they say goodbye. For the first time, the player character is the one who leaves the conversation, <b>logging</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E

40|$|Following {{the ideas}} of the Remote Procedure Call model, we have {{developed}} a logic programming counterpart, naturally called Prolog Remote Predicate Call (Prolog RPC) [1]. The Prolog RPC protocol facilitates the integration of Prolog code in multi-language applications as well as the development of distributed intelligent applications. One use of the protocol's most important uses could be the development of distributed applications that use Prolog at least partially to achieve their goals. Most notably the Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) applications that are suitable for logic programming can profit from the use of the protocol. After proving its usefulness, we went further, developing {{a new version of the}} protocol, making it more reliable and extending its functionality. Because it has a new syntax and the new set of commands, we call this version Enhanced Prolog Remote Procedure Call. This paper describes the new features and modifications this second version introduced. One difference is that a connection comprises two modes, clients being able to switch between them by logging on, respectively <b>logging</b> <b>off.</b> New features include capturing of Prolog program output, and modifying Prolog machine flags. The operation of executing predicates has also been redesigned...|$|E
