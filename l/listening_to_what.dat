25|$|After {{more than}} a decade's {{experience}} in the game, Strom was offered a salary contract over 82 games for $16,000 {{for the first time}} by Commissioner Walter Kennedy in August 1969. It was at this time that Strom became interested in <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> the ABA, which started in 1967, had to offer in the bidding war that ensued between the two leagues over talent. The NBA did not offer benefit plans such as pension, family hospitalization, and long-term disability, which were of importance to Strom and his family. Lured by Borgia, who jumped from the NBA to the ABA to become supervisor of officials, Strom and three other officials—John Vanak, Norm Drucker, and Joe Gushue met with acting ABA Commissioner Jim Gardner during the summer of 1969. The ABA accepted Strom's demands of a $25,000 per year salary, a $25,000 signing bonus, and a health insurance and pension plan. As the four officials left for the ABA in 1969, it brought reform to NBA referees in terms of compensation and benefits. Regular officials in the NBA were offered contracts and salaries increased significantly. Additionally, medical and pension plans were provided for the officials.|$|E

Oh Land described CSS's remix as [...] "more club and minimal" [...] and compared its sound {{to the music}} of the 1980s. Reflecting on all six of the remixes, Oh Land claimed that she only asked musicians that she [...] "really admire" [...] to create the mixes.

500|$|The second verse {{starts with}} eighth note delay taps (1:20–1:22) {{on the first}} lyric [...] "I'm" [...] which {{gradually}} increases until properly sung. It features an A–B pitch change which increases harmonic momentum for the second verse by implying {{a return to the}} cadential D chord in the chorus, instead of a continuation of the tonic E. The second verse is shorter than the first. A dubstep breakdown occurs after the second chorus during which the group chant the lyric [...] "hey" [...] repeatedly {{at the end of each}} line in a call and response. Following a third chorus, the song ends in an outro harmony. According to Nelson, [...] "Wings" [...] is about [...] "believing in yourself, <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> your mom says (because she's always right!) and just not letting any negativity bring you down." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{another letter}} to McKellar she {{describes}} how in just five days {{she wrote the}} 60,000-word book The River of Adventure, the eighth in her Adventure Series, by <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> she referred to as her [...] "under-mind", which she contrasted with her [...] "upper conscious mind". Blyton was unwilling to conduct any research or planning before beginning work on a new book, which coupled {{with the lack of}} variety in her life according to Druce almost inevitably presented the danger that she might unconsciously, and clearly did, plagiarise the books she had read, including her own. Gillian has recalled that her mother [...] "never knew where her stories came from", but that she used to talk about them [...] "coming from her 'mind's eye", as did William Wordsworth and Charles Dickens. Blyton had [...] "thought it was made up of every experience she'd ever had, everything she's seen or heard or read, much of which had long disappeared from her conscious memory" [...] but never knew the direction her stories would take. [...] Blyton further explained in her biography that [...] "If I tried to think out or invent the whole book, I could not do it. For one thing, it would bore me and for another, it would lack the 'verve' and the extraordinary touches and surprising ideas that flood out from my imagination." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{the digital}} sheet music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, {{the song is}} composed in the key of B major and set in common time signature, with it having a dance pop tempo of 110 beats per minute. Lo's vocals span from the low note of B3 to the high note of C5. The song has a minimal and upbeat electronic instrumentation which consists of drums, bass, backup vocals and Lo's voice. The song starts with the words [...] "oh oh", which repeat after every sentence of the verses. The chorus contains the millennial whoop, a vocal melody repeating on the fifth and third notes in a major scale. Some critics noted a contrast between the track's lyrics and production. Carrie Battan of Pitchfork stated that the song [...] "contrasts a giant hook and chorus with snappy verses filled with quietly distinct, often strange imagery: of [...] eating her dinner in the bathtub, getting drunken munchies, seducing dads on playgrounds". Chris Jordan of Asbury Park Press described [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] as a [...] "synth-based pop song with a sweeping chorus", but noted that the lyrical content of the track {{was similar to that}} of rock 'n' roll music. The singer herself stated that: [...] "You can feel the lyrics and the dark and sad but if you combine it with, brings a little to the dark humor as well. I like the thing of dancing along and then <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> I'm actually saying." ...|$|E

500|$|Following a {{long time}} of hiatus in her acting career, Cher was {{announced}} to be returned on the musical film Burlesque (2010) co-starring Christina Aguilera. This {{was the first time}} Cher appeared on the screen since Stuck on You (2003). Talking about the making of the film, Cher revealed, [...] "It’s harder to do things. I've beat my body up so badly, it's amazing it's still talking to me and <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> I say. But I’ve got aches and pains everywhere." [...] The soundtrack was also revealed, with eight songs performed by Aguilera, and two songs by Cher: [...] "Welcome to Burlesque" [...] and [...] "You Haven't Seen the Last of Me". During an interview with a California journal, Cher commented about [...] "You Haven't Seen the Last of Me", [...] "That song, for me, had a lot of meaning. It reminded me that I have to kind of move over." [...] She also spoke about the track with the Fresno Bee, saying [...] "Not that I'm doing it gracefully, because you'd have to pull me over kicking and screaming." [...] In the United States, the song was released to adult contemporary radio station on January 15, 2011 the first single from the soundtrack. In order to promote the song, several promotional remixes were made by Almighty, Dave Aude and StoneBridge. The remix EP, which contains uptempo dance versions of the track, was released onto iTunes Stores on November 24, 2010. The remix done by StoneBridge was released as a single on December 7, 2010. The song is also included in Cher's 25th studio album, Closer to the Truth (deluxe edition).|$|E

2500|$|Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine {{opined that}} [...] "Head First {{is a brief}} trip, but it's {{saturated}} with enough hi-NRG motifs and sounds for countless sweaty workouts at Jack LaLanne." [...] In a mixed review, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted that [...] "Head First returns Goldfrapp to commercial waters—this time the glossy, optimistic 1980s pop that provides the playlist backbone of Magic FM", but found that [...] "there are instances when the songwriting isn't that exciting, when the choruses don't ascend quite as stratospherically as they're supposed to, and you're left <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> is, in essence, an MOR pop album." [...] Rolling Stones Will Hermes expressed that Head First [...] "may be the most lovingly detailed synth-pop album since the golden days of Yaz and Kim Carnes. Yet expert execution doesn't always signal a good idea." [...] Peter Paphides of The Times wrote, [...] "The best moments on [...] Head First—'Believer' and the title track—also double as its uncoolest ones." [...] Marc Hogan from Pitchfork remarked, [...] "Bringing 1980s roller-disco synth-pop motifs out of mothballs has given the UK duo their most immediately entertaining album since 2005 electro-glam juggernaut Supernature", but felt that the duo [...] "fail to give each song a face as memorable as the overall album's Jane Fonda workout-video get-up." ...|$|E
