5|$|A single fungal serpin {{has been}} {{characterized}} to date: celpin from Piromyces spp. strain E2. Piromyces is a genus of anaerobic fungi found in the gut of ruminants and is important for digesting plant material.

Dockerins are commonly found in proteins that localise to the fungal cellulosome, a large extracellular multiprotein complex that breaks down cellulose. It is therefore suggested that celpin may protect the cellulosome against plant proteases. Certain bacterial serpins similarly <b>localize</b> to the cellulosome.|$|E

5|$|Bat {{echolocation}} is a perceptual {{system where}} ultrasonic sounds are emitted specifically to produce echoes.

Microbats use their larynx to create ultrasound, and emit the sound through their mouth and sometimes their nose. The latter is most pronounced in the horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.). Microbat calls range in frequency from 14,000 to well over 100,000Hz, extending beyond the range of human hearing (between 20 and 20,000Hz).|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Localized</b> {{algorithms}} are optimization {{procedures that}} require {{limited amount of}} communication, computation, and storage because their execution targets are wireless sensor networks. There is a wide consensus that <b>localized</b> algorithms are crucial for energy efficient operations in sensor networks, security and privacy, reliability and fault tolerance. In addition, they serve as the enablers of scalable sensor networks. The main technical challenges are how to organize the collection of input data and the dissemination of results, how to optimize in presence of uncertainty, and how to analyze and evaluate <b>localized</b> algorithms. We present sound computation and communication models for <b>localized</b> algorithms. The technical core of the paper is a system of paradigms for developing <b>localized</b> algorithms and several case studies including routing, topology management and sensor fusion. Furthermore, we present several approaches for developing protocols that support <b>localized</b> algorithms and analysis techniques. In addition, we summarize recent research of distributed <b>localized</b> algorithms. We conclude with a short survey of emerging research directions related to <b>localized</b> algorithms...|$|R

5|$|Due {{to a small}} {{customer}} base in Japan, Alisia Dragoon sold few copies on its release (April 24, 1992); the console it was made for, the Sega Mega Drive, was not a popular device in Japan, selling 33.5million units (10% of all Mega Drives/Genesis sold around the world). The game was published earlier by Sega for North America and Europe, on March 30. However, it was a subdued release; Sega did not place major advertisements for {{the game in the}} media. To <b>localize</b> the contents for the Western market, the video game publisher made several cosmetic changes to Alisia Dragoon.

5|$|The {{change in}} the series' setting became an issue in later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious.

5|$|With prey often {{scarce in}} its oceanic environment, the silky shark is a swift, inquisitive, and {{persistent}} hunter.

Its sense of hearing is extremely acute, allowing it to <b>localize</b> the low-frequency noises generated by other feeding animals, and, by extension, sources of food. The silky shark is viviparous, meaning that the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection to their mother. Significant geographical variation is seen in its life history details. Reproduction occurs year-round except in the Gulf of Mexico, where it follows a seasonal cycle. Females give birth to litters of up to 16pups annually or biennially. The newborn sharks spend their first months in relatively sheltered reef nurseries on the outer continental shelf, growing substantially before moving into the open ocean.|$|E
40|$|Inspired by Holstein's work {{on small}} polaron hopping, the {{evolution}} equations of <b>localized</b> states and extended states in presence of atomic vibrations are derived for an amorphous semiconductor. The transition probabilities are obtained for {{four types of}} transitions: from one <b>localized</b> state to another <b>localized</b> state, from a <b>localized</b> state to an extended state, from an extended state to a <b>localized</b> state, and from one extended state to another extended state. At a temperature not too low, any process involving <b>localized</b> state is activated. The computed mobility of the transitions between <b>localized</b> states agrees with the observed `hopping mobility'. We suggest that the observed `drift mobility' originates from the transitions from <b>localized</b> states to extended states. Analysis of the transition probability from an extended state to a <b>localized</b> state suggests that there exists a short-lifetime belt of extended states inside conduction band or valence band. It agrees {{with the fact that}} photoluminescence lifetime decreases with frequency in a-Si/SiO$_{ 2 }$ quantum well while photoluminescence lifetime is not sensitive to frequency in c-Si/SiO$_{ 2 }$ structure.

40|$|The {{world is}} full of <b>localized,</b> nonstandard {{property}} regimes that coexist alongside state property laws. This Article provides the first comprehensive look at the phenomenon of <b>localized</b> property systems and the difficulties that necessarily attend the translation of <b>localized</b> property rights. Rather than survey the numerous <b>localized</b> property systems in the world, this Article explores the common features of the interaction between <b>localized</b> and state property systems. All <b>localized</b> property systems entail translation costs with the wider state property systems around them. Translation costs result from incompatibilities, as well as information and enforcement costs. Focusing on translation costs, the Article examines the pressures for <b>localized</b> systems to converge into larger state systems, as well as the features of <b>localized</b> property that may keep itdistinct. Additionally, it shows that state protection of <b>localized</b> property systems (such as Norwegian protection of the property rights of the indigenous Sámi people) may sometimes lower translation costs but may also lower the utility of the <b>localized</b> systems through poor incorporation into state law. Understanding <b>localized</b> property systems has important implications for understanding the nature of property. Property law systems, like other legal systems, have greater utility with greater numbers of adherents. Thus, using the insights of the economics of network effects is crucial to understanding property. Another potential insight stemming from our analysis is in the theory of commons property: transition costs {{must be taken into account}} when examining collective action solutions to tragedies of the commons...|$|R

5|$|Neurophysiologists {{study the}} chemical, pharmacological, and {{electrical}} {{properties of the}} brain: their primary tools are drugs and recording devices. Thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system, some in highly specific ways. Recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes, either glued to the scalp as in EEG studies, or implanted inside the brains of animals for extracellular recordings, which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons. Because the brain does not contain pain receptors, it is possible using these techniques to record brain activity from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress. The same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients suffering from intractable epilepsy, in cases {{where there was a}} medical necessity to implant electrodes to <b>localize</b> the brain area responsible for epileptic seizures. Functional imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging are also used to study brain activity; these techniques have mainly been used with human subjects, because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time, but they have the great advantage of being noninvasive.|$|E
5|$|Prior to any {{official}} announcement of its western release, Bravely Default was cited by multiple journalists {{as a game}} that should be localized for western markets.

40|$|Abstract—Iterated {{localization}} {{is considered}} where each node {{of a network}} needs to get <b>localized</b> (find its location on 2 -D plane), when initially only a subset of nodes have their location information. The iterated localization process proceeds as follows.

The newly <b>localized</b> nodes {{are included in the}} subset of nodes that have their location information for the next iteration. This process is allowed to continue, until no new node can be <b>localized.</b> The problem is to find the minimum size of the initially <b>localized</b> subset to start with so that the whole network is <b>localized</b> with high probability.
