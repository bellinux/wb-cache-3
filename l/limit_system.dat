5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system remains}} unchanged from Ridge Racer, the checkpoint and time <b>limit</b> <b>system</b> remain the same; {{running out of}} time ends the race and passing through checkpoints grants additional time, although the car drifting is more like Ridge Racer 2. The player drives using automatic transmission or manual transmission. Ridge Racer Revolution supports Namco's NeGcon controller, and adds a rear-view mirror when using the in-car view. The game consists of three courses: 'Novice', 'Intermediate' (also called 'Advanced'), and 'Expert', each having different sections opened, and incorporates modes from the original game; Race, against eleven opponents, and Time Trial, against one. Ridge Racer Revolution adds a mode: Free Run, in which there are no other cars and the player practises driving. There is no lap limit. How fast the cars run depends on which speed grade is used, selectable in Free Run, and can be unlocked for Race. It is not available in Time Trial. A new feature is the option to select the time of day in which the race takes place, although this is not available {{at the start of the}} game. Ridge Racer Revolution features a two-player link-up mode which allows the players access to the original Ridge Racers courses known as 'Special 1' and 'Special 2'. There are two modes in two-player link-up: Race, identical to its single-player counterpart, and Versus, where only the players race against each other. Versus features a handicap option, increasing the speed of the trailing car.|$|E
2500|$|Work {{began on}} [...] section between the M25 and Luton (Junctions 6a and 10) in 2006 and opened in 2009 which {{included}} {{the construction of new}} parallel roads between Junctions 7 and 8 for local traffic together with the widening or replacement of eleven underbridges on one or both carriageways and replacing seven overbridges at a cost of £294million. A variable speed <b>limit</b> <b>system</b> (MIDAS) was installed and the M10 spur was reclassified as part of the A414 road. Escalating costs across the whole of the Highways Agency programme, including the M1 project, where costs had risen to £5.1billion, road protests and criticisms by the Transport Select Committee and the National Audit Office led to wide-ranging re-assessments of the Agency's project costs. Widening was scaled back to section from M25 to Luton (Junctions 6a to 10) that was already in progress and from Nottingham and Mansfield (Junctions 25–28). Hard-shoulder running being to be used for other sections.|$|E
40|$|Dedicated to Professor Mark I. Vishik on the {{occasion}} of his 80 th birthday Abstract. In this paper we investigate a <b>limiting</b> <b>system</b> that arises from the study of steady-states of the Lotka-Volterra competition model with cross-diffusion. The main purpose here is to understand all possible solutions to this <b>limiting</b> <b>system,</b> which consists of a nonlinear elliptic equation and an integral constraint. As far as existence and non-existence in one dimensional domain are concerned, our knowledge of the <b>limiting</b> <b>system</b> is nearly complete. We also consider the qualitative behavior of solutions to this <b>limiting</b> <b>system</b> as the remaining diffusion rate varies. Our basic approach is to convert the problem of solving the <b>limiting</b> <b>system</b> to a problem of solving its “representation ” in a different parameter space. This is first done without the integral constraint, and then we use the integral constraint to find the “solution curve ” in the new parameter space as the diffusion rate varies. This {{turns out to be a}} powerful method as it gives fairly precise information about the solutions. 1. Introduction. I...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, heavily {{traveled}} {{portions of the}} New Jersey Turnpike began using variable speed limit signs, in combination with variable message signs. Officials can adjust the speed limit according to weather, traffic conditions, and construction. More typically, variable speed limits are used on remote stretches of highway in the United States in areas with extreme changes in driving conditions. For example, variable limits were introduced in October 2010 on a 52 mi stretch of Interstate 80 in Wyoming, replacing the winter season speed reduction from 75 to 65 mph {{that had been in}} place since 2008. This Variable Speed <b>Limit</b> <b>system</b> has been proved to be effective in terms of reducing crash frequency and road closures. [...] Similarly, Interstate 90 at Snoqualmie Pass and other mountain passes in Washington State variable speed limits are used to slow traffic in severe winter weather.

This paper documents the findings from a state-of-the-practice review on variable speed <b>limit</b> <b>systems.</b> Such systems dynamically update posted speed limits to better reflect prevailing traffic and environmental conditions. The paper reviews and compares characteristics of variable speed <b>limit</b> <b>systems,</b> and discusses potential benefits and limitations associated with their deployment.

50|$|Because reverse salients <b>limit</b> <b>system</b> {{development}}, {{the further}} development of the system lies in the correction of the reverse salient, where correction is attained through incremental or radical innovations. The reverse salient denotes a focusing device, {{in the words of}} Nathan Rosenberg, for technological system stakeholders, which strive to remove it through innovation. It is possible that the reverse salient is not able to be corrected within the bounds of the existing technological system through incremental innovations. Consequently, radical innovations may be needed to correct the reverse salient. However, radical innovations can lead to the creation of new and different technological systems, as witnessed in the emergence of the alternating current system that overcame the problem of low cost electricity distribution, which the direct current system could not.|$|E

50|$|All of {{the video}} games in the Super Mario Bros. series with the {{exception}} of Super Mario Bros. 2 have some sort of time limit. These limits usually start large and are used to keep players moving instead of waiting for enemies to fall down pits. Faster music appears when the time limit is about to be breached. Any amount of time left over is multiplied by a certain amount and added into the overall score. Time limits also appear in video games like Bébé's Kids and Timecop, both for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Other games that have time limits for various systems include: Mario Party (to determine when a minigame ends), Street Fighter V (to show how much time remains in a round), and Mario Kart 8 (to show how much time is left until a race or battle starts).

50|$|In {{attempting}} {{to obtain a}} better approximation of the exact solution to the given problem, {{it is crucial that}} the determination of corrective solutions, which depart from the limit case, be much simpler than directly investigating the governing system. At first sight, the possibilities of such an approach seem restricted to varying the parameters determining the system only within a narrow range. However, experience in the investigation of different physical problems shows that if the system’s parameters have changed sufficiently and the system has deviated far from the symmetrical limit case, another <b>limit</b> <b>system,</b> often with less obvious symmetries can be found, to which an asymptotic analysis is also applicable. This allows one to describe the system’s behavior {{on the basis of a}} small number of limit cases over the whole range of parameter variations. Such an approach corresponds to the maximum level of intuition, promotes further insights, and eventually leads to the formulation of new physical concepts. It is also important that asymptotic methods help to establish the connection between different physical theories.The aim of the asymptotic approach is to simplify the object. This simplification is attained by decreasing the vicinity of the singularity under consideration. It is typical that the accuracy of asymptotic expansions grows with localization. Exactness and simplicity are commonly regarded as mutually exclusive notions. When tending to simplicity, we sacrifice exactness, and trying to achieve exactness, we expect no simplicity. Under localization, however, the antipodes converge; the contradiction is resolved in a synthesis called asymptotics. In other words, simplicity and exactness are coupled by an “uncertainty principle” relation while the domain size serves as a small parameter - a measure of uncertainty.|$|E
