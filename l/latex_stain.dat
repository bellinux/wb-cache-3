E-mail: caiobiasi@usp. br The possible existence of interdependence {{in the blood}} nutrition of both atrial and ventricular territories has been a subject of concern to cardiologists, mainly related to vascularization of the sinoatrial node and its dependence on just one coronary artery or both, and its relation with the predominance of these vessels in the ventricular vascularization. Therefore, this research aimed evaluated the relation of blood irrigation of the sinoatrial node {{in relation to the}} coronary artery predominance in the ventricle vascularization. In doing so, we analyzed 30 hearts of cats without pedigree, males and females, adults of several ages. They were not carrying any heart problems. The hearts were injected by the thoracic aorta with Neoprene <b>Latex</b> 450, <b>stained</b> with red pigment, and then they were dissected. It was found that when there was a prevalence of ventricular vascularization of the left type (63. 34 %) the sinoatrial node irrigation was predominantly in the dependency of the Ramus proximalis atrii dextri (78. 9 %) or with less frequency by Ramus proximalis atrii sinister (21. 1 %).

Methods: Monocyte differentiation was evaluated by Wright-Giemsa <b>staining,</b> <b>latex</b> particle assay and flow cytometry. Induction of apoptosis was analyzed by Annexin-PI double staining. Results: The new compound, at 0. 5 - 2. 5 µg/ml inhibited proliferation of U 937 cells by more than 70 % and their viabilities were decreased by 47 ± 2. 1 % after 72 h of treatments. In addition, we found that the effect of the new compound on U 937 cells was associated with differentiation toward monocyte/macrophage lineage based on nitroblue tetrazolium reduction assay, morphology change, phagocytic activity and expression of cell surface markers (CD 14 and CD 11 b) as analyzed by flow cytometry.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{develop an}} {{efficient}} method for evaluating cell surface hydrophobicity and {{to apply the}} method to demonstrate the effects of fungal growth conditions on cell surface properties. METHODS: Yeast isolates were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline and mixed with deep blue-dyed polystyrene microspheres. Flow cytometry was used to detect the degree of microsphere binding to yeast cells. Different strains of yeast were compared for intrinsic microsphere binding activity and changes in growth conditions were invoked to modify the relative surface hydrophobicity. RESULTS: Commercially available blue-dyed polystyrene microspheres showed strong fluorescence in the FL 3 channel, whereas yeast cells did not show appreciable FL 3 fluorescence. Microspheres and yeast were generally distinguishable {{on the basis of}} size revealed by forward light scatter. This method showed a wide variation in intrinsic cell surface hydrophobicity among Candida albicans strains. Likewise, variation in hydrophobicity of non-albicans yeast species was observed. Growth on solid media, incubation at 25 degrees C, or 250 mg/dl glucose concentration increased hydrophobicity compared with growth in liquid media, incubation at 37 degrees C, or 50 mg/dl glucose, respectively. Growth in 1 x 10 (- 9) M estradiol had no appreciable effect on hydrophobicity. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Stained</b> <b>latex</b> microspheres fluoresced in the FL 3 channel of the flow cytometer and bound to yeast cells to an extent related to the surface hydrophobicity of the yeast.

The statistical analysis {{was made by the}} Qui-square (X 2) test, with a 5 % level of significance, to test if the nullity hypothesis is true for the of lienal artery main ramifications. The relations between the lienal artery and spleen length with rostrum-sacral length were calculated by the correlation coefficient “r” varying between - 1 and + 1, that is, - 1 ? r ?+ 1. The mean length of the lienal artery was 5. 96 cm. In all (100 %) dissected rabbits the lienal artery, originated directly from the celiac artery as an only one artery giving different numbers of branches to the spleen: one branch in seven (23. 3 %) animals, two branches in seven (23. 3 %) animals, three branches in 10 (33. 3 %) animals, four branches in four (13. 3 %) animals and five branches in two (6. 7 %) animals. From the spleen, the lienal artery gave different numbers of branches to the stomach greater curvature: one branch in seven (23. 3 %) animals, two in four (13. 3 %) animals, three in five (16. 7 %) animals, four in three (10 %), and five in only one (3. 3 %) animal. Positive correlation was observed between the lienal artery and spleen length with the rostrum-sacral length. The number of lienal artery branches is not gender dependent. Na presente pesquisa foram utilizados 30 espécimes de coelhos adultos Nova Zelândia, 13 machos e 17 fêmeas. Após fixação com solução de formaldeido a 10 % e preenchimento do sistema arterial com solução de látex corado procedeu-se a dissecção para a observação da disposição das artérias lienais. A análise estatística foi realizada através teste do X 2 (Qui-quadrado), ao nível de significância de 5 %, para testar se a hipótese de nulidade é verdadeira para o número de ramificações principais da artéria lienal. As relações do comprimento da artéria lienal e do baço em função do comprimento rostro-sacral foram calculadas através do coeficiente de correlação “r”, que pode variar entre - 1 e + 1, isto é, - 1 £ r £ + 1. A média do comprimento da artéria lienal foi de 5, 96 cm. Em todos os coelhos dissecados (100 %) a artéria lienal se originou diretamente da artéria celíaca como uma artéria única, emitindo diferentes ramos para o baço: um ramo em sete (23, 3 %) animais, dois ramos em sete (23, 3 %) animais, três ramos em 10 (33, 3 %) animais, quatro ramos em quatro (13, 3 %) animais e cinco ramos em dois (6, 7 %) animais. Do baço a artéria lienal emitiu diferentes números de ramos para a grande curvatura do estomago: um ramo em sete (23, 3 %) animais, dois em quatro (13, 3 %) animais, três em cinco (16, 7 %) animais, quatro em três (10 %), e cinco em apenas um (3, 3 %) animal. Foi observada correlação positiva entre o comprimento do baço e da artéria lienal em função do comprimento rostro-sacral. O número de ramificações da artéria lienal independe do sexo do animal...|$|R
40|$|The {{mesenteric}} artery {{is a high}} caliber vessel {{dependent on}} the abdominal artery, right below {{the emergence of the}} vessels destined for the liver and stomach. The present study aimed to describe the behavior of the arterial vessel in the small intestine of the crab-eating raccoon (Procyon cancrivorus). The animals were collected on highways (roadkill). Cannulation of the abdominal aorta, perfusion with warmed water (40 ºC) and <b>stained</b> <b>latex</b> injection (Neoprene 450, Dupont do Brasil and Sulvinil stain, Glassuret S. A) were performed, followed by formaldehyde fixation (10 %). The dissection and photographic documents (Sony Cyber-shot, 8. 1 megapixels) made it possible to systemize the arteries and define the vascular patterns of the viscera. It was verified that the mesenteric cranial artery supports the entire jejune and the mesenteric portion of the ileum. Next to the mesenteric border, it becomes an anastomosis forming vascular arches from where straight arteries leave, supplying the mesenteric portion and sometimes also the jejunal antimesentericportion. The artery that irrigates the ileum comes up as a branch of the cranial mesenteric artery. Anatomic knowledge of the vascular pattern of the crab-eating raccoon (Procyon cancrivorus) is of fundamental importance for researches regarding the arterialdistribution of the intestine considering anatomic variances. A artéria mesentérica é um vaso de grande calibre dependente da artéria aorta abdominal, imediatamente abaixo da emergência dos vasos destinados ao fígado e estômago. O objetivo do presente estudo foi descrever o comportamento dos vasos arteriais do intestino delgado em mão-pelada (Procyon cancrivorus). Os animais são procedentes de coleta em rodovias (mortos por acidente). Realizou-se a canulação da aorta abdominal, perfusão com água aquecida (40 ºC) e injeção de látex corado (Neoprene 450, Dupont do Brasil e Sulvinil Corante, Glassuret S. A), seguido de fixação em formaldeído (10 %). As dissecações edocumentação fotográfica (Câmera Sony Cyber-shot, 8. 1 megapixels) permitiram sistematizar as artérias e definir os padrões vasculares da víscera. Verificamos que a artéria mesentérica cranial supre todo o jejuno e a face mesentérica do íleo. Próximo à borda mesentérica, anastomosa-se formando as arcadas vasculares e desta partem as artérias retas, que suprem à face mesentérica e, às vezes, a face antimesentérica do jejuno. A artéria que irriga o íleo surge como último ramo da artéria mesentérica cranial.

Seven species from five different families were used In a comparative study, which were Meconopsis cambrica & Papaver rhoeas (Papaveraceae), Hevea brasiliensis & Euphorbia wulfenii (Euphorbiaceae), Musa acuminata (Musaceae), Mandevilla splendens (Apocyanaceae) & Taraxacum officinale (Compositae/Asteraceae). Several preparation procedures have been compared and optimised for the structural preservation of the laticifers and for examination of their distribution in these taxa. Methods of fixation have been studied. Fresh unfixed samples showed good structural information and laticifer distribution in the tissue. This technique was also very fast and convenient to use. In practice this protocol can be applied in monitoring and screening bulk samples in a breeding program, where speed and convenience are very important. Samples fixed with aldehyde fixative gave reasonably good results for histology study but not at the electron microscope level. The samples fixed with this fixative however, were highly suited to Immunohistochemical work. This information is invaluable and will be used and adapted for Hevea study in Malaysia. Both osmium and a combination of osmium tetroxide and zinc iodide were superior in term of ultrastructural preservation. Embedding media for laticifers were compared. For histological and immunohistochemical studies, Paraplast wax was used. The preparation procedure was easy and convenient, and overall structural information of laticifers was good. Spurr resin and araldite are both epoxy resins, but samples embedded in araldite gave better, more acceptable results. The carcinogenic nature of Spun- resin means that it must be handled with extreme caution, making it a less convenient embedding medium. The only acrylic resin was LR White, which was initially Intended for an immunocytochemistry study where the priority was to retain antigenic sites. Samples embedded with this resin did not show good structural information. The final set of procedures evaluated was staining methods. The staining procedure has to be fast, must differentially stain laticifers and must be reliable. These stains can be grouped into two categories; standard histological stains such as Toluidine Blue and Safranin O with Astra Blue, and fluorescent stains such as Calcofluor, ANS and Acridine Orange. However almost all stains tested failed to differentially <b>stain</b> <b>latex</b> or laticifers. They however did assist in clarifying for identification the location and distribution of laticifers in the tissues. Using Toluidine Blue was very fast and easy, but all the fluorescent stains are faster and easier to use. Laticifers in all species examined, exhibited a similar pattern of distribution. They were located in the cambial regions of stems, petioles, leaves and roots, or closely located within the vascular bundle...|$|R

A artéria cerebral rostral originou-se do ramo rostral da a. carótida interna e seguiu rostromedialmente. Nesse trajeto emitiu as aa. oftálmica interna e etmoidal interna. Em seguida a a. cerebral rostral uniu-se com sua contralateral, formando a a. comunicante rostral, que se bifurcou nas aa. inter-hemisféricas rostrais. A a. inter-hemisférica rostral emitiu as aa. rinal, hemisféricas rostrais e hemisféricas mediais rostrais. Da a. rinal foram originadas as aa. lateral do bulbo olfatório, hemisférica frontal e medial do bulbo olfatório.

Then, the rostral cerebral artery joined with its contra lateral, forming the rostral communicating artery, which bifurcated as the rostral interhemispheric arteries. The rostral inter-hemispheric artery emitted the rhinal, rostral hemispheric and rostral medial hemispheric arteries. From the rhinal artery originated the lateral olfactory bulb, frontal hemispheric and medial olfactory bulb arteries.
