Of particular interest is the potential to establish and hence study the properties of spherically- and cylindrically-symmetric flames and their response to external forces not related to gravity. For example, in an earlier experimental study of the burner-stabilized cylindrical premixed flames, the possibility of flame stabilization through flow divergence was established, while the resulting one-dimensional, adiabatic, stretchless flame also allowed an accurate means of determining the laminar flame speeds of combustible mixtures. We have recently extended our studies of the flame structure in microgravity along the following directions: (1) Analysis {{of the dynamics of}} spherical premixed flames; (2) Analysis of the spreading of cylindrical diffusion flames; (3) Experimental observation of an interesting dual luminous zone structure of a steady-state, microbuoyancy, spherical diffusion flame of air burning in a hydrogen/methane mixture environment, and its subsequent quantification through computational simulation with detailed chemistry and transport; (4) Experimental quantification of the unsteady growth of a spherical diffusion flame; and (5) Computational simulation of stretched, diffusionally-imbalanced premixed flames near and beyond the conventional <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>flammability,</b> and the substantiation of the concept <b>of</b> extended <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>flammability.</b> Motivation and results of these investigations are individually discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{foundations}} {{of a relatively}} simple two-step kinetic scheme for flame chemistry are outlined, involving a model chain branching process that should adopt the activation temperature of a rate-limiting branching reaction in order to offer a broad approximation for hydrocarbon flames. A model energetic intermediate reactant then acts as a buffer between fuel consumption {{and the release of}} heat, as the intermediate is converted into products through a completion reaction step. By taking the rate of the latter reaction to be linear in the concentration of the intermediate, which is consistent with the final state being an equilibrium in a broader chemical system, a form of the model is arrived at which admits asymptotic solutions in a thermodiffusive context with constant coefficients. These are developed to second order for large values of the activation energy of the branching reaction and are found to involve the same trends that are seen for lean methane and hydrogen flames calculated using detailed chemical and transport models. Linear stability analysis identifies the ranges of Lewis numbers in which cellular or oscillatory instability can arise, with the latter form of instability disappearing above a threshold heat of reaction. These and the underlying flame solutions themselves depend on the heat of reaction and the degree of heat loss but not on the activation temperature of the branching reaction, to leading order.

40|$|The {{chemical}} species produced in a buoyant, turbulent diffusion flame exposed initially to {{a supply of}} fresh air and extending into a reduced-oxygen environment containing products of combustion are investigated. The stably stratified, vitiated region is formed by placing a hood above a burner so that it accumulates the gases of the fire plume, while the direct injection of air into the upper portion of the hood allows conditions to be studied where the stoichiometry of the collected gases is different {{than that of the}} plume flow crossing the interface between these two regions. Measurements of the composition show that the species produced in the flame depend primarily on the stoichiometry of the gases in the vitiated region, but are independent of the fuel-air ratio of the mass transported across the interface by the plume. A weak dependence of species concentrations on the temperature of the product gas layer was observed over the range 500 to 900 K. Using a detailed chemical kinetics model, the composition of the product gases is found to be stable for the temperatures measured in the experiments, but reactions do occur at temperatures above 700 K. The effects of varying the fuel's molecular structure on the product gas composition are also considered. Experiments were conducted with natural gas, ethylene, and propylene fuels. The presence of a double bond between carbon atoms appears to assist the combustion process towards further completion. As expected, the behavior of the propylene fuel (which contains both single and double carbon-carbon bonds) fell between that of the other fuels. Additionally, the minimum oxygen concentration necessary to support a diffusion flame in a homogeneous, vitiated environment is investigated. By submerging the entire flame into the interior volume of the hood, the oxygen content of the supporting atmosphere is controlled. As conditions approach the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>flammability,</b> radiation from soot in the reaction zone becomes imperceptible, leaving only a weakly-luminous blue flame.

40|$|An {{investigation}} into {{different aspects of}} importance {{in the understanding of}} explosibility of hybrid mixtures of coal dus 4 air and gases potentially found within mine workings through a comprehensive laboratory program of explosibility tests was conducted. Plotting of test results revealed that conditions of potential explosibility could be described using two dimensional flammability limit surfaces for coal dust/oxygen; methane/oxygen; and coal dust/methane mixtures. From these plots, the three dimensional flammability envelopes defining the explosibility of the coal dust/methane/oxygen mixtures can be defined and illustrated for a coal sample. The surfaces of the three dimensional envelope describe limits which separate inert mixtures of coal dust and methane at varying oxygen levels from those concentrations which are ignitable under defined conditions. It is considered appropriate to generalise that the geometric shapes <b>of</b> these <b>limit</b> regions are applicable to all type classifications of coal dust. There are practical applications of these results to the underground environment. The action of free radical initiators in the propagation of a methane gas explosion was examined for its applicability to the <b>flammability</b> <b>of</b> coal dust/gas/air mixtures. The oxides of nitrogen or NOx radicals have influence upon the lean <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>flammability</b> <b>of</b> hybrid mixtures and this is illustrated by use of three dimensional coordinate geometry.

40|$|The {{effects of}} diluents on the liftoff of turbulent, {{partially}} premixed methane and ethylene jet flames for potential impact in industrial burner operation for multifuel operation have been investigated. Both fuel jets were diluted with nitrogen and argon in separate experi-ments, and the flame liftoff heights were compared {{for a variety}} of flow conditions. Meth-ane flames have been shown to liftoff at lower jet velocities and reach blowout conditions much more rapidly than ethylene flames. Diluting ethylene and methane jets with nitro-gen and argon, independently, resulted in varying trends for each fuel. At low dilution levels (5 % by mole fraction), methane flames were lifted to similar heights, regardless of the diluent type; however, at higher dilution levels (10 % by mole fraction) the argon diluent produced a flame which stabilized farther downstream. Ethylene jet flames proved to vary less in liftoff heights with respect to diluent type. Significant soot reduction with dilution is witnessed for both ethylene and methane flames, in that flame luminosity alter-ation occurs at the flame base at increasing levels of argon and nitrogen dilution. The increasing dilution levels also decreased the liftoff velocity of the fuel. Analysis showed little variance among liftoff heights in ethylene flames for the various inert diluents, while methane flames proved to be more sensitive to diluent type. This sensitivity is attributed to the more narrow <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>flammability</b> <b>of</b> methane in comparison to ethylene, as well as the much higher flame speed of ethylene flames.

50|$|A thermobaric bomb's {{effective}} yield requires {{the most appropriate}} combination {{of a number of}} factors; among these are how well the fuel is dispersed, how rapidly it mixes with the surrounding atmosphere, and the initiation of the igniter and its position relative to the container of fuel. In some designs, strong munitions cases allow the blast pressure to be contained long enough for the fuel to be heated up well above its auto-ignition temperature, so that once the container bursts the super-heated fuel will auto-ignite progressively as it comes into contact with atmospheric oxygen.Conventional upper and lower <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>flammability</b> apply to such weapons. Close in, blast from the dispersal charge, compressing and heating the surrounding atmosphere, will have some influence on the lower limit. The upper limit has been demonstrated strongly to influence the ignition of fogs above pools of oil. This weakness may be eliminated by designs where the fuel is preheated well above its ignition temperature, so that its cooling during its dispersion still results in a minimal ignition delay on mixing. The continual combustion of the outer layer of fuel molecules as they come into contact with the air, generates additional heat which maintains the temperature of the interior of the fireball, and thus sustains the detonation.|$|R
40|$|A {{constant}} volume cylindrical combustion bomb of 100 mm diameter, and {{of variable}} length (from 250 mm to 1000 mm) has been built. The effect of charge stratification on the ignitability and subsequent flame propagation of lean (1 > 6) methane-oxygen mixtures has been investigated. The test mixtures were quiescent with initial conditions of 25 °C and 1. 5 bar absolute. The stratified charge {{was created by}} injecting small quantities of a relatively rich (λ = 4. 57) premixed methane-oxygen mixture through a modified commercially available spark plug so that an easily ignitable mixture formed {{in the vicinity of}} the spark electrodes. The injector used was a commercially available Bosch gasoline injector, suitably modified for gas operation. The injection pressure was 5 bar gauge. The size of the injected puff could be altered by adjusting the duration (from 0 - 100 ms) for which the injector was opened, and the timing of the spark could be adjusted so that it occurred either before, after or at the end of injection. Results show that the injected premixed puff is an efficient high energy ignition source for very lean methane-oxygen mixtures. For the most reliable ignition performance a delay of 10 ms between the end of injection and the occurrence of the spark has been found to be desirable. This is attributed to the decay of the turbulence produced by the puff. Long injection durations (greater than 20 ms) also improved ignition reliability, due to the larger puff size. The use of charge stratification did not enable combustion to continue below the ideal flammability limit. It did extend the equipment lean <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>flammability</b> from λ = 7. 3 (spark alone) to λ = 8. 35, and thus demonstrated that it could be useful as a limit extender in non-ideal combustion situations. Results from the longest bomb used (1000 mm) show that the flame dies out after successful ignition has been achieved, and that a distinct lean flammability limit does not exist. Experimental evidence suggests that the flame is generating turbulence as it propagates, and this turbulence causes the flame to become self accelerating. Further, it is thought that the flame generated turbulence is the primary cause of flame extinction (in the form of turbulence induced gas phase quenching) after successful ignition in the 1000 mm bomb...|$|E
40|$|This thesis traces and {{critically}} reviews {{recent developments in}} hydrogen fuelling of internal combustion engines. It reports {{the development of an}} improved fuelling system that has been tested on a Ricardo E 6 variable compression spark ignition engine, in the Thermodynamics laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Canterbury. The introduction of hydrogen to an internal combustion engine via the inlet manifold (external mixture formation), often results in the occurrence of pre-ignition. This is because hydrogen, with its low ignition energy and extreme lean <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>flammability,</b> is easily ignited by residual gases or hot spots in an engine cylinder. If pre-ignition occurs before inlet valve closure, the mixture may burn back through pre-mixed gases in the inlet manifold. Another serious disadvantage with external mixture formation is that hydrogen displaces a large volume of air, effectively reducing the volumetric efficiency of the engine. To overcome these problems hydrogen may be injected directly into an engine combustion chamber during the compression stroke, although if injection commences too early in the stroke pre-ignition may still occur. It is thus considered that the most desirable system for fuelling an internal combustion engine on hydrogen is to employ direct gaseous injection at high pressure late in the compression stroke. There are a number of problems involved with the design and development of a suitable high pressure hydrogen direct injector. In particular the injector must actuate rapidly and be controllable to a high degree of accuracy to consistently meter precise quantities of fuel at each injection. Leakage of hydrogen through the injector when closed must be minimised in order to avoid unnecessary fuel wastage and to prevent the build up of a flammable pre-mixed mixture that could lead to pre-ignition. A suitable injector has been designed and tested. The injector is electromagnetically actuated for electronic control of injection timing and duration (control of injection duration being necessary to vary the quantity of fuel delivered). The injector has a nominal lift distance of 0. 2 mm and can be opened for durations as short as 1 ms. A fluorocarbon elastomer Quad-ring was used in the seat of the valve to provide a leak free seal for the high pressure hydrogen. Engine testing was conducted to determine the performance of the valve. The engine was tested on hydrogen for compression ratios of 8 : 1, 10 : 1 and 12 : 1 over a range of operating conditions. Results of engine performance, complete with combustion chamber pressure traces and exhaust gas emission analysis are presented. The design concept has proven to be successful with satisfactory operation of the engine on hydrogen without any combustion related problems. The elastomeric seal, although providing leak free operation, had an average lifetime of about 30 minutes. Future injector development work should focus on devising a highly durable injector seat seal which minimises leakage...|$|E

There are two <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>flammability,</b> upper <b>flammability</b> <b>limit</b> (UFL) and lower flammability limit (LFL), which define the flammable region of a combustible gas/vapor. This research focuses on the <b>flammability</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen and its binary mixtures with light hydrocarbons (methane, ethane, n-butane, and ethylene) at sub-atmospheric pressures. The <b>flammability</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen, light hydrocarbons, and binary mixtures of hydrogen and each hydrocarbon were determined experimentally at room temperature (20 ?C) and initial pressures ranging from 1. 0 atm to 0. 1 atm. The experiments were conducted in a closed cylindrical stainless steel vessel with upward flame propagation. It was found that the flammable region of hydrogen initially widens when the pressure decreases from 1. 0 atm to 0. 3 atm, then narrows with the further decrease of pressure. In contrast, the flammable regions of the hydrocarbons narrow when the pressure decreases. For hydrogen and the hydrocarbons, pressure has a much greater impact on the UFLs than on the LFLs. For binary mixtures of hydrogen and the hydrocarbons, the flammable regions of all mixtures widen when the fraction of hydrogen in the mixture increases. When the pressure decreases, the flammable regions of all mixtures narrow. The applications of Le Chatelier?s rule and the Calculated Adiabatic Flame Temperature (CAFT) model to the <b>flammability</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> the mixtures were verified.

The adiabatic flame temperatures (AFTs), an important parameter in the risk assessment of fire and explosion, of hydrogen and the hydrocarbons were also calculated. The influence of sub-atmospheric pressures on the AFTs was investigated. A linear relationship between the AFT and the corresponding flammability limit is derived. Furthermore, the consequence of fire relating to hydrogen and the hydrocarbons is discussed based on the AFTs of the chemicals...|$|R

40|$|Combustion must be {{maintained}} in the turbojet-engine combustor {{over a wide range}} of operating conditions resulting from variations in required engine thrust, flight altitude, and flight speed. Furthermore, combustion must be efficient in order to provide the maximum aircraft range. Thus, two major performance criteria of the turbojet-engine combustor are (1) operatable range, or combustion limits, and (2) combustion efficiency. Several fundamental requirements for efficient, high-speed combustion are evident from the discussions presented in chapters III to V. The fuel-air ratio and pressure in the burning zone must lie within specific <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>flammability</b> (fig. 111 - 16 (b)) in order to have the mixture ignite and burn satisfactorily. Increases in mixture temperature will favor the flammability characteristics (ch. III). A second requirement in maintaining a stable flame -is that low local flow velocities exist in the combustion zone (ch. VI). Finally, even with these requirements satisfied, a flame needs a certain minimum space in which to release a desired amount of heat, the necessary space increasing with a decrease in pressure (ref. 1). It is apparent, then, that combustor design and operation must provide for (1) proper control of vapor fuel-air ratios in the combustion zone at or near stoichiometric, (2) mixture pressures above the minimum flammability pressures, (3) low flow velocities in the combustion zone, and (4) adequate space for the flame...|$|R
40|$|During gaseous {{diffusion}} plant operations, conditions {{leading to the}} formation of flammable gas mixtures may occasionally arise. Currently, these could consist of the evaporative coolant CFC- 114 and fluorinating agents such as F 2 and ClF 3. Replacement of CFC- 114 with a non-ozone-depleting substitute is planned. Consequently, in the future, the substitute coolant must also be considered as a potential fuel in flammable gas mixtures. Two questions of practical interest arise: (1) can a particular mixture sustain and propagate a flame if ignited, and (2) what is the maximum pressure that can be generated by the burning (and possibly exploding) gas mixture, should it ignite? Experimental data on these systems, particularly for the newer coolant candidates, are limited. To assist in answering these questions, a mathematical model was developed to serve as a tool for predicting the potential detonation pressures and for estimating the composition <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>flammability</b> for these systems based on empirical correlations between gas mixture thermodynamics and flammability for known systems. The present model uses the thermodynamic equilibrium to determine the reaction endpoint of a reactive gas mixture and uses detonation theory to estimate an upper bound to the pressure that could be generated upon ignition.

In addition to the non-radioactive metals in the waste, however, the SRS radioactive waste also contains a variety of radionuclides, hence, hydrogen gas is also present in the vapor space of the ECC system. Because hydrogen is flammable, {{the impact of this}} resultant gas stream on the Lower <b>Flammability</b> <b>Limit</b> (LFL) <b>of</b> hydrogen must be understood for all possible operating scenarios of both normal and off-normal situations, with particular emphasis at the elevated temperatures and pressures of the typical ECC operating conditions. Oxygen is a known accelerant in combustion reactions, but while there are data associated with the behavior of hydrogen/oxygen environments, recent, relevant studies addressing the effect of ozone on the <b>flammability</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen proved scarce. Further, discussions with industry experts verified the absence of data in this area and indicated that laboratory testing, specific to defined operating parameters, was needed to comprehensively address the issue. Testing was thus designed and commissioned to provide the data necessary to support safety related considerations for the ECC process. A test matrix was developed to envelope the bounding conditions considered credible during ECC processing. Each test consists of combining a gas stream of high purity hydrogen with a gas stream comprised of a specified mixture of ozone and oxygen in a temperature and pressure regulated chamber such that the relative compositions of the two streams are controlled.

40|$|The microcombustor {{described}} in this report was developed primarily for thermal management in microsystems and as a platform for micro-scale flame ionization detectors (microFID). The microcombustor consists of a thin-film heater/thermal sensor patterned on a thin insulating membrane that is suspended from its edges over a silicon frame. This micromachined design has very low heat capacity and thermal conductivity and is an ideal platform for heating catalytic materials placed on its surface. Catalysts {{play an important role}} in this design since they provide a convenient surface-based method for flame ignition and stabilization. The free-standing platform used in the microcombustor mitigates large heat losses arising from large surface-to-volume ratios typical of the microdomain, and, together with the insulating platform, permit combustion on the microscale. Surface oxidation, flame ignition and flame stabilization have been demonstrated with this design for hydrogen and hydrocarbon fuels premixed with air. Unoptimized heat densities of 38 mW/mm{sup 2 } have been achieved for the purpose of heating microsystems. Importantly, the microcombustor design expands the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>flammability</b> (Low as compared with conventional diffusion flames); an unoptimized LoF of 1 - 32 % for natural gas in air was demonstrated with the microcombustor, whereas conventionally 4 - 16 % observed.

This feature will permit the use of this technology in many portable applications were reduced temperatures, lean fuel/air mixes or low gas flows are required. By coupling miniature electrodes and an electrometer circuit with the microcombustor, the first ever demonstration of a microFID utilizing premixed fuel and a catalytically-stabilized flame has been performed; the detection of - 1 - 3 % of ethane in hydrogen/air is shown. This report describes work done to develop the microcombustor for microsystem heating and flame ionization detection and includes a description of modeling and simulation performed to understand the basic operation of this device. Ancillary research on the use of the microcombustor in calorimetric gas sensing is also described where appropriate...|$|R
40|$|Everyone {{knows that}} an {{automobile}} engine wastes fuel and energy when it runs with a fuel-rich mixture. 'Lean' burning, mixing in more air and less fuel, {{is better for}} the environment. But lean mixtures also lead to engine misfiring and rough operation. No one knows the ultimate limits for lean operation, for 'weak' combustion that is friendly to the environment while still moving us around. This is where the accidental verification of a decades-old prediction may have strong implications for designing and running low-emissions engines in the 21 st century. In 1944, Soviet physicist Yakov Zeldovich predicted that stationary, spherical flames are possible under limited conditions in lean fuel-air mixtures. Dr. Paul Ronney of the University of Southern California accidentally discovered such 'flame balls' in experiments with lean hydrogen-air mixtures in 1984 during drop-tower experiments that provided just 2. 2 seconds of near weightlessness. Experiments aboard NASA's low-g aircraft confirmed the results, but a thorough investigation was hampered by the aircraft's bumpy ride. And stable flame balls can only exist in microgravity. The potential for investigating combustion at the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>flammability,</b> and the implications for spacecraft fire safety, led to the Structure of Flame Balls at Low Lewis-number (SOFBALL) experiment flown twice aboard the Space Shuttle on the Microgravity Sciences Laboratory- 1 (MSL- 1) in 1997. Success there led to the planned reflight on STS- 107. Flame balls are the weakest fires yet produced in space or on Earth. Typically each flame ball produced only 1 watt of thermal power. By comparison, a birthday candle produces 50 watts. The Lewis-number measures the rate of diffusion of fuel into the flame ball relative to the rate of diffusion of heat away from the flame ball. Lewis-number mixtures conduct heat poorly. Hydrogen and methane are the only fuels that provide low enough Lewis-numbers to produce stable flame balls, and even then only for very weak, barely flammable mixtures. Nevertheless, under these conditions flame balls give scientists the opportunity to test models {{in one of the}} simplest combustion experiments possible. SOFBALL- 2 science objectives include: Improving our understanding of the flame ball phenomenon; Determining the conditions under which flame balls exist; Testing predictions of flame ball lifetimes; Acquiring more precise data for critical model comparison...|$|R
40|$|Consolidated Edison type fuel pellets were {{irradiated}} and analyzed, {{to determine}} the extent of fracturing, particle size of fines produced, and the rate of dissolution in boiling 13 M HNO/sub 3 /- 0. 04 M NaF - 0. 1 M Al(NO/sub 3 /) 3. Fused sodium or potassium hydroxide was used to shatter the pellets at 400 deg C or higher. Similar pellets were dissolved in H/sub 3 /PO/sub 4 / and fused ammonium bifluoride. An investigation was made of the thermodynamics and <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>flammability</b> <b>of</b> gases expected during the dissolution of sodium-bonded stainlesssteel-clad fuels in aqua regia or sulfuric acid. The amount of hydrogen evolved during Darex dissolution of 304 stain less steel was studied as a function of the fraction of total dissolving time and the total gas evolved. The rate of dissolution of tin in HF containing H/sub 2 /O/sub 2 / was> 10 mg/cm/sup 2 /- min at 13 to 72 deg C, but decreased> 10 times at 13 deg C when HF was replaced by NH/sub 4 /F. A technique was developed for disintegrating and leaching graphite fuels, which yielded a recovery of 99. 85 % + uranium from fuels containing approximately 5 % uranium. The uranium extraction in the Immi hot- cell facility indicated a 0. 33 % loss in the mixer-settler using the 6 % TBP flowsheet. Yankee Atomic fuel, containing a fissia concentration of 10, 000 Mwd/ T uranium, was dissolved by the Darex and Sulfex Processes {{to determine the}} amount of acid insoluble residues formed. Solvent extraction studies revealed that thorium and uranium could be costripped from a 30 % TBP neutral solution with Al(NO/sub 3 /) /sub 3 /. Distribution coefficients were determined for thorium and uranium in 30 % TBP-Amsco systems. The presence of H/sub 2 /O/sub 2 / in Zirflex dissolver solutions was found to decrease the corrosion rates of Hastelloy F, type 309 stainless steel, and Ni-o-nel. Palladium-titanium alloys showed somewhat higher corrosion rates than Ti- 45 A in Zirflex and fluoboric-nitric acid solutions. Specimens of type 304 L stainless steel exposed to Darex-Purex waste solutions continued to show intergranular attack. The presence of borate in Thorex dissolver solutions lowered the corrosion rate of titanium in the solution phase, and eliminated pitting in the vapor phase. The radiation effects on di- sec-butyl phenylphosphonate were investigated. The distillation of degraded 30 % TBP in Amsco 125 - 82 was tested for use in solvent repurification operations. The ruthenium volatility during the evaporation of wastes was reduced from 66 to 79 % to 15 % in the presence of TBP, and to 7 to 8 % in a NO atmosphere, with or without TBP. A study was made of the nitrate-organic reactions taking place when Purex 1 WW concentrates containing TBP were processed. A satisfactory method was found for solidifying Sulfex decladding solutions yielding blocks having compression strengths of 3000 psi. A hydroxyl-form strong-base anion exchange resin removed 72 % of the gross fission product activity from low-level waste and raised the pH of the effluent water to 11. 3. The Purex 1 WW diluted waste was made 0. 124 M in oxalic acid, which increased the breakthrough capacity of Dowex 50 resin for strontium by 2 to 3 and for rare earths> 3. Thermogravimetric and static studies were made of the kinetics of hydrogen reduction of CaSO/sub 4 /. (For preceding period see CF- 60 - 3 - 84.) (B. O. B...|$|R
