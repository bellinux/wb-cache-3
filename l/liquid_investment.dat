50|$|Real estate {{markets in}} most {{countries}} are not as organized or efficient as markets for other, more <b>liquid</b> <b>investment</b> instruments. Individual properties are unique to themselves and not directly interchangeable, which presents a major challenge to an investor seeking to evaluate prices and investment opportunities. For this reason, locating properties in which to invest can involve substantial work and competition among investors to purchase individual properties may be highly variable depending on knowledge of availability.

5000|$|According to the European Commission {{proposal}} {{the introduction}} of eurobonds would create new means through which governments finance their debt, by offering safe and <b>liquid</b> <b>investment</b> opportunities. This [...] "could potentially quickly alleviate the current sovereign debt crisis, as the high-yield Member States could benefit from the stronger creditworthiness of the low-yield Member States." [...] The effect would be immediate even if {{the introduction of}} eurobonds takes some time, since changed market expectations adapt instantly, resulting in lower average and marginal funding costs, particularly to those EU member states most hit by the financial crisis. The Commission also believes that eurobonds could make the eurozone financial system more resilient to future adverse shocks and reinforce financial stability. Furthermore, they could reduce the vulnerability of banks in the eurozone to deteriorating credit ratings of individual member states by providing them with a source of more robust collateral. Setting a euro-area wide integrated bond market would offer a safe and <b>liquid</b> <b>investment</b> opportunity for savers and financial institutions that matches its US$ counterpart in terms of size and liquidity, which would also strengthen {{the position of the}} euro as an international reserve currency and foster a more balanced global financial system. On the other hand, the governments of those states that most people would like to take over those debt risks do not {{think that this is a}} good idea and see other effects. They do not understand why it should help a group of states that have excessively borrowed and circumvented the EU contracts for many years should now be helped by making it even easier for them to borrow even more via Eurobonds.

5000|$|Green {{bonds are}} <b>liquid</b> <b>investment</b> {{vehicles}} that raise capital for conservation efforts and environmentally stable practices in general.

Investors range from private corporations and firms to municipalities and even state governments. [...] Conservation efforts include preserving endangered watersheds and rainforests. Over time, the investors would hypothetically receive a profitable return from these initial investments. Many financial professional argue that these green bonds symbolize a historic shift from investing in fossil fuel-based industry to climate change mitigation. [...] They speculate that this would attract more investors and create more diversified portfolios among this base. The first Green Bond initiative was San Francisco's Solar bonds authority to finance both conservation and local renewables, placed on the ballot and approved by voters in 2001 and incorporated into its Community Choice Aggregation program. [...] In the late-2000s, the World Bank Treasury and the IFC pioneered these investments. In 2013, the IFC issued about $3.7 billion worth of green bonds to the private sector.

5000|$|Apply {{investment}} materials: The ceramic mould, {{known as}} the investment, is produced by repeating a series of steps—coating, stuccoing, and hardening—until a desired thickness is achieved. Coating involves dipping a pattern cluster into a slurry of fine refractory material and then draining to create a uniform surface coating. Fine materials are used in this first step, also called a prime coat, to preserve fine details from the mould. Stuccoing applies coarse ceramic particles by dipping patterns into a fluidised bed, placing it in a rainfall-sander, or by applying materials by hand. Hardening allows coatings to cure. These steps are repeated until the investment reaches its required thickness—usually 5 to 15 mm. Investment moulds are left to dry completely, which can take 16 to 48 hours. Drying can be accelerated by applying a vacuum or minimizing environmental humidity. Investment moulds can also be created by placing the pattern clusters into a flask and then pouring <b>liquid</b> <b>investment</b> material from above. The flask is then vibrated to allow entrapped air to escape and help the investment material fill any small voids. [...] Common refractory materials used to create the investments are: silica, zircon, various aluminium silicates, and alumina. Silica is usually used in the fused silica form, but sometimes quartz is used because it is less expensive. Aluminium silicates are a mixture of alumina and silica, where commonly used mixtures have an alumina content from 42 to 72%; at 72% alumina the compound is known as mullite. During the primary coat(s), zircon-based refractories are commonly used, because zirconium {{is less likely to}} react with the molten metal. Prior to silica, a mixture of plaster and ground up old molds (chamotte) was used. The binders used to hold the refractory material in place include: ethyl silicate (alcohol-based and chemically set), colloidal silica (water-based, also known as silica sol, set by drying), sodium silicate, and a hybrid of these controlled for pH and viscosity.|$|E

40|$|This paper revisits the Piotroski F-score {{strategy}} in the U. S. stock universe from an investor's perspective. Primarily, we aim to answer the question, whether the high abnormal returns of more than 20 percent p. a. previously proclaimed by academics (Piotroski, 2000) and practitioners (AAII, 2015) can be feasibly captured by individual or professional investors. As such, our focal point is a pragmatic approach an average investor could opt for as well. We use the software Stock Investor Pro from the American Association of Individual Investors to obtain screenshots of the U. S. stock universe from 2005 - 2015 on a weekly basis. Next, we devise a long-only and a long-short variant of the Piotroski strategy with monthly or weekly rebalancing frequencies. At first glance, our findings re-confirm the high returns of this fundamental value strategy. Specifically, the monthly (weekly) long-only strategy generates raw returns of 30. 93 (65. 41) percent p. a. These returns outperform relevant benchmark indices and can only partially be explained by common systematic risk factors. However, consideration of liquidity constraints and an estimate of trading costs in this low liquidity stock universe render both strategies virtually unprofitable. Nevertheless, there may be potential for further research aiming at implementing such a strategy on more <b>liquid</b> <b>investment</b> universes...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{financial}} performance of employee and community based saving and credit cooperatives societies in Kisarawe district. Indicators of financial performance were size of a SACCO, capital, operating expenses, liquidity, and loan to members ratios. The population was a sample of eight SACCOs operating in Kisarawe district; three of them are employee-based while the remaining five are community-based SACCOs. The researcher employed secondary data method of data collection. Secondary data included annual SACCOs’ reports and only audited financial statements for individual SACCOs for the period 2008 - 2011 were used. The findings of the study revealed that E-SACCOs exploit more efficiently economies of scale than C-SACCOs that is the former enjoy more cost advantage which arises with increased output of total assets than the later and thus E-SACCOs perform better financially than C-SACCOs. E-SACCOs have smaller amount of cash to lend to members, that is smaller working capital than CSACCOs and therefore the former perform better financially than the later. CSACCOs have a better sound capital position and are able to pursue business opportunities more effectively and have more flexibility to deal with problems arising from unexpected losses, thus achieving more increased profitability than ESACCOs.

40|$|This study {{provides}} an overview of federal debt – its history, its composition, its management, its economic uses, and a discussion of recent trends. The Continental Congress began issuing debt securities in 1776, and the United States has had outstanding debt ever since. The first Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton established sound goals and principles for debt management that transformed U. S. government debt from highly speculative and illiquid securities into the world’s safest and most <b>liquid</b> <b>investment.</b> Because of Hamilton’s visionary leadership, Treasuries developed a unique set of characteristics – default risk-free, a seamless yield curve, high liquidity, a deeply integrated market, and extremely low bid-ask spreads – that let Treasuries perform many economic functions other than financing past federal budget deficits. For example, the Federal Reserve uses Treasuries to conduct U. S. monetary policy. Foreign central banks hold Treasuries as a store of value and a means to intervene in foreign exchange markets. Treasuries are the premier “safe haven ” investment during economic turbulence. Wall Street uses the Treasury yield curve as the default risk-free pricing benchmark, while Washington indexes its loans to students and farmers to Treasury yields. Treasuries collateralize approximately four-fifths of the transactions in the $ 2. 5 trillion a day repurchase agreement (repo) market. Portfolio managers employ Treasuries for interest rate hedging or speculation and for improving risk-return trade-off in their portfolios.

40|$|What {{accounts}} for {{the differences in the}} performance of cooperatively-owned banks in the Dutch financial crisis of the early 1920 s? This thesis measures and explains the (relative) performance of boerenleenbanken (rural Raiffeisen banks) and middenstandsbanken (urban Schulze-Delitzsch banks) during the Netherlands' interwar banking crisis by applying various economic methods to new historical evidence. The thesis asks: (1) what were the effects on risk-taking behaviour of differences in the religious attitudes of bankers and their customers? (2) what was the relationship between interbank competition and financial stability? and (3) what was the consequence of the liability choices made by shareholders for their banks' continued survival? Using a combination of economic theory, quantitative financial analysis and qualitative business histories, this thesis finds that: (1) banks serving small religious groups were less willing, despite being more able, to take on risks than those serving majority denominations; (2) those banks that were subject to the lowest competitive pressures enjoyed the most <b>liquid</b> <b>investment</b> portfolios; and (3) the choice of liability limitation available to bankers in uenced their balance sheet risks, for the worse. Together, these findings lead to the conclusion that social, organisational and institutional factors each explain part of the heterogeneity in the fate of the Netherlands' cooperative banks during a period which includes unprecedented debt- deflationary financial turmoil: hence, (1) strict membership criteria and the use of personal guarantors in loan agreements acted as strong devices to allow banks for minorities, regardless of their denomination, to screen and monitor their customers; (2) the switching costs associated with religious affiliation resulted in a competition- stability tradeoff during periods of extreme distress; and (3) the stakeholders of the banks which failed were probably less risk-averse than those of banks which did not, the consequence of endogenous group formation by risk type...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} demand for {{long-term}} care (LTC) and longevity insurance from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. The results provide insights into the design of new retirement products and policy settings, which attempt to address the current weak markets for both products. The thesis first develops a life-cycle model of annuitization, consumption, and investment decisions for a single retiree facing stochastic capital market returns, uncertain health status, mortality risk, and uncertain out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure. Simulation results from the calibrated model show that a life care annuity product, from bundling LTC and longevity insurance, significantly increases the optimal annuitization level. This product substantially improves individual welfare by allowing for {{a higher level of}} consumption and investing a higher proportion of liquid wealth in the risky asset. The thesis then conducts and analyzes a large experimental survey where participants make hypothetical allocations of retirement savings to three products: a LTC income product, a life annuity and a <b>liquid</b> <b>investment</b> account. The LTC income product offers income in LTC states whether paid services are used or not. Results show that this product complements, rather than substitutes, high-level informal care. Having access to the product materially affects the annuitization choices for around half of participants, allowing most individuals in this group to release precautionary savings and purchase additional longevity insurance. While no evidence is found against a risk pooling equilibrium in the purchase decision of life care annuities, there is evidence against the equilibrium due to adverse selection in the preferred product features among female purchasers. The thesis finally calibrates individual utility parameters in a life-cycle model of the retirement phase, using the stated preferences for LTC insurance. Results show that the calibrated model can explain the stated demand for the LTC income product for 80 % of survey participants, accounting for around two thirds of the variation. The preferences of individuals who plan to rely on family members for low-level care but would pay for professional high-level care are better explained. The model predictability is also positively correlated with individuals' financial literacy, product knowledge, and education...|$|E
