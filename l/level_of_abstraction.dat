25|$|His {{foundational}} work on {{algebraic geometry}} is {{at a higher}} <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>abstraction</b> than all prior versions. He adapted the use of non-closed generic points, {{which led to the}} theory of schemes. He also pioneered the systematic use of nilpotents. As 'functions' these can take only the value 0, but they carry infinitesimal information, in purely algebraic settings. His theory of schemes has become established as the best universal foundation for this field, because of its expressiveness as well as technical depth. In that setting one can use birational geometry, techniques from number theory, Galois theory and commutative algebra, and close analogues of the methods of algebraic topology, all in an integrated way.|$|E

He shifted attention {{from the study of}} individual varieties to the relative point of view (pairs of varieties related by a morphism), allowing a broad generalization of many classical theorems. The first major application was the relative version of Serre's theorem showing that the cohomology of a coherent sheaf on a complete variety is finite-dimensional; Grothendieck's theorem shows that the higher direct images of coherent sheaves under a proper map are coherent; this reduces to Serre's theorem over a one-point space.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the paper}} we {{describe}} a sequential classification scheme that iteratively explores <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>abstraction</b> in the description <b>of</b> examples. These <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>abstraction</b> represent attribute values of increasing precision. Specifically, we assume attribute values constitute an ontology (i. e., attribute value ontology) reflecting a domain-specific background knowledge, where more general values subsumes more precise ones. While there are approaches that consider <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>abstraction</b> during learning, {{the novelty of}} our proposal consists in exploring <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>abstraction</b> when classifying new examples. The described scheme is essential when tests that increase precision of example description are associated with costs – such a situation is often encountered in medical diagnosis. Experimental evaluation of the proposed classification scheme combined with ontological Bayes classifier (i. e., a näıve Bayes classifier expanded to handle attribute value ontologies) demonstrates that the classification accuracy obtained at higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>abstraction</b> (i. e., more general description of classified examples) converges very quickly to the classification accuracy for classified examples represented precisely. This finding indicates {{we should be able}} to reduce the number of tests and thus limit their cost without deterioration of the prediction accuracy...|$|R
25|$|A slew of {{centrality}} measures {{exist to}} determine the ‘importance’ of a single node in a complex network. However, these measures quantify {{the importance of a}} node in purely topological terms, and the value of the node does not depend on the ‘state’ of the node in any way. It remains constant regardless of network dynamics. This is true even for the weighted betweenness measures. However, a node may very well be centrally located in terms of betweenness centrality or another centrality measure, but may not be ‘centrally’ located {{in the context of a}} network in which there is percolation. Percolation of a ‘contagion’ occurs in complex networks in a number of scenarios. For example, viral or bacterial infection can spread over social networks of people, known as contact networks. The spread of disease can also be considered at a higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>abstraction,</b> by contemplating a network of towns or population centres, connected by road, rail or air links. Computer viruses can spread over computer networks. Rumours or news about business offers and deals can also spread via social networks of people. In all of these scenarios, a ‘contagion’ spreads over the links of a complex network, altering the ‘states’ of the nodes as it spreads, either recoverably or otherwise. For example, in an epidemiological scenario, individuals go from ‘susceptible’ to ‘infected’ state as the infection spreads. The states the individual nodes can take in the above examples could be binary (such as received/not received a piece of news), discrete (susceptible/infected/recovered), or even continuous (such as the proportion of infected people in a town), as the contagion spreads. The common feature in all these scenarios is that the spread of contagion results in the change of node states in networks. Percolation centrality (PC) was proposed with this in mind, which specifically measures the importance of nodes in terms of aiding the percolation through the network. This measure was proposed by Piraveenan et al.|$|E
