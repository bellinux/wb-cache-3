5|$|Hepatitis C {{is caused}} by an RNA virus. In 80% of people infected, the disease becomes chronic, and they remain {{infectious}} {{for the rest of}} their lives unless they are treated. There is an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug ribavirin combined with interferon. Treatments for chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus by a similar strategy using <b>lamivudine</b> and other anti-viral drugs have been developed. In both diseases, the drugs stop the virus from reproducing and the interferon kills any remaining infected cells.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, the {{development}} of antiviral drugs has increased rapidly, mainly driven by the AIDS pandemic. Antiviral drugs are often nucleoside analogues, which are molecules very similar, but not identical to DNA building blocks. When the replication of virus DNA begins, some of these fake building blocks are incorporated. As soon as that happens, replication stops prematurelyâ€”the fake building blocks lack the essential features that allow the addition of further building blocks. Thus, DNA production is halted, and the virus can no longer reproduce. Examples of nucleoside analogues are aciclovir for herpes virus infections and <b>lamivudine</b> for HIV and hepatitis B virus infections. Aciclovir {{is one of the}} oldest and most frequently prescribed antiviral drugs.|$|E
5|$|Reverse transcribing viruses: These have ssRNA (Retroviridae, Metaviridae, Pseudoviridae) or dsDNA (Caulimoviridae, and Hepadnaviridae) {{in their}} particles. Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes (retroviruses), use a DNA {{intermediate}} to replicate, whereas those with DNA genomes (pararetroviruses) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use a reverse transcriptase, or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme, {{to carry out}} the nucleic acid conversion. Retroviruses integrate the DNA produced by reverse transcription into the host genome as a provirus {{as a part of the}} replication process; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus. They are susceptible to antiviral drugs that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, e.g. zidovudine and <b>lamivudine.</b> An example of the first type is HIV, which is a retrovirus. Examples of the second type are the Hepadnaviridae, which includes Hepatitis B virus.|$|E
25|$|When {{antiretroviral}} {{drugs are}} used improperly, multi-drug resistant strains {{can become the}} dominant genotypes very rapidly. In the era before multiple drug classes were available (pre-1997), the reverse transcriptase inhibitors zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, stavudine, and <b>lamivudine</b> were used serially or in combination leading {{to the development of}} multi-drug resistant mutations.|$|E
25|$|AZT {{has been}} used for {{post-exposure}} prophylaxis (PEP) in combination with another antiretroviral drug called <b>lamivudine.</b> Together they work to substantially reduce the risk of HIV infection following the first single exposure to the virus. More recently, AZT has been replaced by other antiretrovirals such as tenofovir to provide PEP.|$|E
25|$|An {{improved}} {{knowledge of}} the action of reverse transcriptase has led to better nucleoside analogues to treat HIV infections. One of these drugs, <b>lamivudine,</b> has been approved to treat hepatitis B, which uses reverse transcriptase {{as part of its}} replication process. Researchers have gone further and developed inhibitors that do not look like nucleosides, but can still block reverse transcriptase.|$|E
25|$|As HIV uses reverse {{transcriptase}} to copy its genetic material and generate new viruses (part of a retrovirus proliferation circle), specific drugs {{have been designed}} to disrupt the process and thereby suppress its growth. Collectively, these drugs are known as reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and include the nucleoside and nucleotide analogues zidovudine (trade name Retrovir), <b>lamivudine</b> (Epivir) and tenofovir (Viread), as well as non-nucleoside inhibitors, such as nevirapine (Viramune).|$|E
25|$|Immunoinformatics {{is using}} the basic {{bioinformatics}} tools such as ClustalW, BLAST, and TreeView, as well as specialized immunoinformatics tools, such as EpiMatrix, IMGT/V-QUEST for IG and TR sequence analysis, IMGT/ Collier-de-Perles and IMGT/StructuralQuery for IG variable domain structure analysis. Methods that rely on sequence comparison are diverse and have been applied to analyze HLA sequence conservation, help verify the origins of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sequences, and construct homology models {{for the analysis of}} hepatitis B virus polymerase resistance to <b>lamivudine</b> and emtricitabine.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 and 2002, {{the number}} of {{patients}} living with HIV/AIDS being identified through treatment services began to increase. As many as 69,000 of these people were the rural poor who had been infected when they sold their blood and plasma in the mid-1990s and who were unable to access or afford much-needed antiretroviral treatment. On the basis of the successes of programmes in other nations, such as Brazil, a free antiretroviral therapy programme was piloted in late 2002 in Shangcai county, Henan province, one of the most severely affected areas. Patients were provided with a combination of zidovudine or didanosine plus <b>lamivudine</b> and nevirapine. On the basis of the improved health status and survival of the initial cohort, the programme was scaled up in early 2003, mainly through the China CARES programme.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the high}} risk of {{perinatal}} transmission, the CDC recommends screening all pregnant women for HBV at their first prenatal visit. It is safe for non-immune pregnant women to receive the HBV vaccine. Based on the limited available evidence, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends antiviral therapy in pregnant women whose viral load exceeds 200,000 IU/mL. A {{growing body of evidence}} shows that antiviral therapy initiated in the third trimester significantly reduces transmission to the neonate. A systematic review of the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry database found that there was no increased risk of congenital anomalies with Tenofovir; for this reason, along with its potency and low risk of resistance, the AASLD recommends this drug. A 2010 systematic review and meta-analysis found that <b>Lamivudine</b> initiated early in the third trimester also significantly reduced mother-to-child transmission of HBV, without any known adverse effects.|$|E
500|$|Current HAART {{options are}} {{combinations}} (or [...] "cocktails") consisting {{of at least}} three medications belonging to at least two types, or [...] "classes," [...] of antiretroviral agents. Initially treatment is typically a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) plus two nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Typical NRTIs include: zidovudine (AZT) or tenofovir (TDF) and <b>lamivudine</b> (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC). Combinations of agents which include protease inhibitors (PI) are used if the above regimen loses effectiveness.|$|E
500|$|Although {{none of the}} {{available}} drugs can clear the infection, they can stop the virus from replicating, thus minimizing liver damage. As of 2008, there are seven medications licensed {{for the treatment of}} [...] infection in the United States. These include antiviral drugs <b>lamivudine</b> (Epivir), adefovir (Hepsera), tenofovir (Viread), telbivudine (Tyzeka) and entecavir (Baraclude), and the two immune system modulators interferon alpha-2a and PEGylated interferon alpha-2a (Pegasys). In 2015 the World Health Organization recommended tenofovir or entecavir as first-line agents. Those with current cirrhosis are in most need of treatment.|$|E
500|$|Antiviral {{drugs are}} often {{nucleoside}} analogues (fake DNA building-blocks), which viruses mistakenly incorporate into their genomes during replication. The life-cycle {{of the virus}} is then halted because the newly synthesised DNA is inactive. This is because these analogues lack the hydroxyl groups, which, along with phosphorus atoms, link together to form the strong [...] "backbone" [...] of the DNA molecule. This is called DNA chain termination. Examples of nucleoside analogues are aciclovir for Herpes simplex virus infections and <b>lamivudine</b> for HIV and Hepatitis B virus infections. Aciclovir {{is one of the}} oldest and most frequently prescribed antiviral drugs.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Lamivudine</b> was {{the first}} {{approved}} oral nucleoside analogue. While effective and potent, <b>lamivudine</b> {{has been replaced by}} newer, more potent treatments in the Western world and is no longer recommended as first-line treatment. However, it is still used in areas where newer agents either have not been approved or are too costly. Generally, the course of treatment is a minimum of one year with a minimum of six additional months of [...] "consolidation therapy." [...] Based on viral response, longer therapy may be required, and certain patients require indefinite long-term therapy. Due to a less robust response in Asian patients, consolidation therapy is recommended to be extended to at least a year. All patients should be monitored for viral reactivation, which if identified, requires restarting treatment. <b>Lamivudine</b> is generally safe and well-tolerated. Many patients develop resistance, which is correlated with longer treatment duration. If this occurs, an additional antiviral is added. <b>Lamivudine</b> as a single treatment is contraindicated in patients coinfected with HIV, as resistance develops rapidly, but it can be used as part of a multidrug regimen.|$|E
2500|$|Adefovir dipivoxil, a {{nucleotide}} analogue, {{has been}} used to supplement <b>lamivudine</b> in patients who develop resistance, but is no longer recommended as first-line therapy.|$|E
2500|$|Nucleoside reverse {{transcriptase}} inhibitors (NRTI) and nucleotide {{reverse transcriptase}} inhibitors (NtRTI) are nucleoside and nucleotide analogues which inhibit reverse transcription. [...] HIV is an RNA virus and hence unable to become {{integrated into the}} DNA in {{the nucleus of the}} human cell; it must be [...] "reverse" [...] transcribed into DNA. Since the conversion of RNA to DNA is not done in the mammalian cell it is performed by a viral protein which makes it a selective target for inhibition. NRTIs are chain terminators such that once incorporated, work by preventing other nucleosides from also being incorporated into the DNA chain because of the absence of a 3' OH group. Both act as competitive substrate inhibitors. [...] Examples of currently used NRTIs include zidovudine, abacavir, <b>lamivudine,</b> emtricitabine, and tenofovir.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lamivudine</b> is {{administered}} by mouth, and it is rapidly absorbed with a bio-availability of over 80%. Some research suggests that <b>lamivudine</b> can cross the blood-brain barrier. <b>Lamivudine</b> is often given in combination with zidovudine, with which it is highly synergistic. <b>Lamivudine</b> treatment {{has been shown to}} restore zidovudine sensitivity of previously resistant HIV. <b>Lamivudine</b> showed no evidence of carcinogenicity or mutagenicity in in vivo studies in mice and rats at doses from 10 to 58 times those used in humans.|$|E
50|$|Next in {{line was}} 2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine (Emtricitabine, FTC) which isa {{structural}} homologue of <b>lamivudine.</b> The structural {{difference is the}} 5-fluoro-modification of the base moiety of <b>lamivudine.</b> It is similar in many ways to <b>lamivudine</b> and is active against both HIV-1 and hepatitis B virus (HBV).|$|E
5000|$|Antivirals, more specifically, <b>lamivudine</b> (increased plasma {{concentrations}} of <b>lamivudine),</b> zalcitabine (increased plasma {{concentrations of}} zalcitabine) and zidovudine (increased risk of haematological reactions) ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lamivudine</b> has reverse {{chirality}} {{compared to}} didanosine, stavudine, zidovudine, and natural nucleosides. Mitochondrial DNA polymerase may not {{recognize it as}} a substrate. <b>Lamivudine</b> is not toxic to mitochondria in vivo. [...] Individuals who had been taking didanosine combined with stavudine exhibited improved mitochondrial function when they switched to <b>lamivudine</b> combined with tenofovir.|$|E
5000|$|In HIV, {{high level}} {{resistance}} {{is associated with}} the M184V/I mutation in the reverse transcriptase gene as reported by Raymond Schinazi's group at Emory University. GlaxoSmithKline claimed that the M184V mutation reduces [...] "viral fitness", because of the finding that continued <b>lamivudine</b> treatment causes the HIV viral load to rebound but at a much lower level, and that withdrawal of <b>lamivudine</b> results in a higher viral load rebound with rapid loss of the M184V mutation; GSK therefore argued that there may be benefit in continuing <b>lamivudine</b> treatment even in the presence of high level resistance, because the resistant virus is [...] "less fit". The COLATE study has suggested that there is no benefit to continuing <b>lamivudine</b> treatment in patients with <b>lamivudine</b> resistance. [...] A better explanation of the data is that <b>lamivudine</b> continues to have a partial anti-viral effect even {{in the presence of the}} M184V mutation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lamivudine</b> {{has been}} used for {{treatment}} of chronic hepatitis B at a lower dose than for treatment of HIV/AIDS. It improves the seroconversion of e-antigen positive hepatitis B and also improves histology staging of the liver. Long-term use of <b>lamivudine</b> leads to emergence of a resistant hepatitis B virus (YMDD) mutant. Despite this, <b>lamivudine</b> is still used widely as it is well tolerated.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lamivudine,</b> {{commonly}} called 3TC, is an antiretroviral medication {{used to prevent}} and treat HIV/AIDS. It {{is also used to}} treat chronic hepatitis B when other options are not possible. It is effective against both HIV-1 and HIV-2. It is typically used in combination with other antiretrovirals such as zidovudine and abacavir. <b>Lamivudine</b> may be included as part of post-exposure prevention in those who have been potentially exposed to HIV. <b>Lamivudine</b> is taken by mouth as a liquid or tablet.|$|E

5000|$|... of <b>lamivudine</b> can {{be traced}} back to the mid-1970s while Bernard Belleau was {{investigating}} sugar derivatives. <b>Lamivudine</b> was developed as the sulfur analogue of zalcitabine (see table 2). It was initially synthesized as a racemic mixture (BCH-189) and analysis showed that both positive and negative enantiomers of BCH-189 (2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine) had in vitro activity against HIV. <b>Lamivudine</b> is the negative enantiomer and is a pyrimidine nucleoside analogue. The 3' carbon of the ribose ring of 2'-deoxycytidine has been replaced by a sulfur atom because it had greater anti-HIV activity and is less toxic than the positive enantiomer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lamivudine</b> and {{zidovudine}} are not extensively metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes.|$|E
50|$|Other {{drugs with}} adverse {{reactions}} include adefovir, dabigatran etexilate, <b>lamivudine,</b> and vincristine.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lamivudine</b> is well {{absorbed in}} the body and {{distributes}} widely into the extravascular space. Oral bioavailability is >80% and overall metabolism is insignificant where approximately 95% of the drug is found unchanged in the urine. The only known metabolite found in humans is trans-sulfoxide. The half-life of <b>lamivudine</b> is 10 to 15 hours and binds poorly to plasma proteins.|$|E
