40|$|Secondary and <b>logged-over</b> {{tropical}} <b>forests</b> {{cover more}} than 600 million hectares. An international workshop held in Bogor (Indonesia) in November 1997 provided a forum of {{discussion on the}} research priorities for the sustainable management of secondary forests in Indonesia and more generally in South East Asia. Secondary forests were defined as: "woody vegetation regrowing on land whose previous forest cover was destroyed by at least 90 % by human activities or natural disaster". In these proceedings five papers focus on the use and manipulation of secondary forests as part of smallholders’ resource management strategies, six papers refer to management aspects of <b>logged-over</b> <b>forests</b> for timber production, mainly focusing on the application of silviculture (e. g. conditions for natural regeneration and enrichment techniques). There is also {{an analysis of the}} socio-economic consequences of forest changes in relation to the future economic development of two Indonesian provinces. The workshop concluded that secondary and <b>logged-over</b> <b>forests</b> are complex ecosystems providing a large range of timber and forest products and environmental values but a clear typology of these very different forests is not yet defined. Secondary forests are quite different from <b>logged-over</b> <b>forests</b> in both structure and species composition and {{there is a need to}} develop new silvicultural concepts for their management and silvicultural interventions favouring non-timber forest products. Indonesian forest policy and regulations and their implications for <b>logged-over</b> <b>forests</b> were debated. Socio-economic aspects were also recognised as an important feature, which should retain more attention in forest regulations than in the past. The potential of the Indonesian Selective Logging System (TPTI) in achieving and promoting forest management is now questionable.

SAR systems operating with high spatial resolutions and different wavelengths (i. e., X-, C-, L- and P-band) acquired data in Guyana and Colombia. Three fundamentally different information sources from the radar return signal were considered in the study: its strength or backscatter, polarization and phase, and spatial variability or texture. Radiometric, polarimetric, and textural attributes were computed from predefined image regions selected to represent five types of primary forest, selectively logged forest, secondary forest, and a mixture of nonforest cover types.

The stream originates in Pasoh Forest Reserve, Negeri Sembilan and then flows through four different types of land use: undisturbed forest, swamp, degraded <b>logged-over</b> <b>forest</b> and agriculture. Water quality parameters chosen for the study include pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended solids (SS), ammoniacal-nitrogen (NH 3 -N), temperature, electrical conductivity (Ec) and turbidity. Stream flow rate was also measured. Computation of water quality status was based on Department of Environment’s (DOE) -Water Quality Index (DOE-WQI) and Harkin’s Index (HI). Relatively higher values of water quality parameters (DO, BOD, COD, NH 3 -N, SS and turbidity) and lower value of pH were recorded in the agricultural area. Water quality status started to degrade after the stream passed through the swampy area (DOE-WQI = 88. 9, HI = 26. 0) and its water quality status was slightly degraded (DOE-WQI = 91. 7, HI = 24. 0) in the <b>logged-over</b> <b>forest.</b> Overall analysis showed that the water quality status within the agricultural area (DOE-WQI = 92. 04, HI = 34. 0) was significantly degraded.

40|$|Tropical {{forest area}} is disappearing {{at the rate}} of 13. 5 million ha each year, due mainly to {{clearing}} for agriculture and shifting cultivation. Timber harvesting results in more than 5 million ha of tropical forest annually being transformed into degraded, poorly managed, <b>logged-over</b> <b>forests.</b> The reduction and degradation caused by anthropological activities affect not only the sustainable production of timber but also the global environment. Accurate scientific information will enable managers to devise silvicultural systems to enhance soil properties and forest resources important for sustainable production and to minimize deleterious impacts of harvesting and short rotation plantations. Ultimately, rehabilitation can increase the area of forest as well as conserve remaining primary forests and environmental quality. Rehabilitation aims to improve biological diversity, increase commercial value of timber and non-timber products, increase forest functions and improve soil fertility. Technical advances will reduce logging impacts, accelerate natural regeneration and improve species selection, enrichment, sustainable site management, catalytic planting and site evaluation and classification. Socio-economic reform should focus on local community participation and acceptance. The CIFOR/Japan project has undertaken research in many countries to evaluate impacts of harvesting and fires on forest ecosystems and to develop methods to rehabilitate <b>logged-over</b> <b>forests</b> and degraded forestlands in ways that are biologically successful as well as socio-economically acceptable.

This research paper shows the strong correlation between the opening of plantation land in Indonesia and Malaysia and fires that cause haze.

40|$|In Indonesia, {{vegetation}} fires occur {{every year}} in the dry season. To determine where and why fires occur, the natural and cultural landscape features that influence the location of fires were analysed. We investigated the probability of fire occurrence as a function of predisposing conditions and ignition sources, such as land use, land use zoning, accessibility or land cover, to understand the spatial determinants of fires. The study area is the entire province of Jambi, central Sumatra, Indonesia. This province has a diverse setting of actors (small- and large-holders), land cover types and land uses. Fires were extracted for 1992 / 1993 from National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration’s Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) satellite data. The results of the spatial statistical analysis show that fire occurrence in Jambi Province in 1992 / 1993 was determined both by predisposing conditions (mostly climate, elevation and suitability for specific tree crops) and human-related causes (presence of transmigration projects and land allocation to specific land uses). National policies are thus a major driving forces of fires through land allocation. Road accessibility is only an important determinant of fires in forests. Few fires seem to be accidental. While logging companies control fire during their exploitation of concessions, <b>logged-over</b> <b>forests</b> and forests allocated to production but not yet under use have many fires.

Based on studies of the peat swamp forest of the Giam Siak Kecil–Bukit Batu Biosphere Reserve carried out between 2009 and 2010, this paper discusses forest types and regeneration processes in terms of promoting biodiversity conservation and sustainable management of the remaining peat swamp forest. Permanent plots covering a total area of three hectares were established in natural and disturbed forest areas. Within these plots, 135 tree species belonging to 34 families were identified. Mixed peat swamp forest and bintangur forest, which have different dominant species, were identified as the main forest types. The greatest species richness was in <b>logged-over</b> <b>forest,</b> with 82 species and a density of 2, 492 stems ha- 1. The success of regeneration varied between typical main species in the <b>logged-over</b> <b>forest</b> and in forest disturbed by wind and fire. All of the forest stands had high densities of trees with diameters at breast height (DBH) of 3 – 10 cm, which are a potential source of recruitment to ensure the sustained regeneration of the forest remaining in the Biosphere Reserve. Regeneration {{is very important for}} improving the condition of disturbed peat swamp forest areas in the reserve, but natural regeneration will not be sufficient to restore the forest vegetation and conserve the associated biodiversity. Some form of human-assisted accelerated regeneration will be needed, such as enrichment planting of typical canopy species that have problems with establishment. It is important for the remaining natural peat swamp forests to be conserved because of their unique forest-type formations which have distinct dominant species, floristic composition, diversity and local environment characteristics. Improved management of secondary forest must be achieved through rehabilitation, halted forest conversion, and reducing the impact of disturbance by wind and fire...|$|E

40|$|Tropical {{forests are}} being cleared {{at a rate}} of 16. 9 million {{hectares}} per year and timber harvesting results in over 5 million hectares becoming secondary forests annually without adequate management. This decrease and degradation affect both timber production and many environmental values. Selective and clear cutting, and burning are major causes of land degradation. An assessment is needed of harvesting impacts that influence rehabilitation methods. The harvesting impacts on ecosystems vary with time and methods of logging, timber transporting methods, logged tree species, soil characteristics, topographies, local rainfall patterns etc., and must be assessed in a range of conditions with long term monitoring. Increased supply of wood from plantation forests has the potential to reduce pressure on natural forest resources as well as contributing to environmental care and economic advancement for landholders. Short-rotation plantations can result in changes in nutrient storage and cycling processes due to factors such as harvesting wood, fertilisation, erosion, leaching, and modified patterns of organic matter turnover. These factors can affect storage and supply of soil nutrients for tree growth and consequently the sustainability of plantation systems. Opportunities exist to manipulate soil organic matter through silvicultural practices but these must be technically feasible, economically viable and socially acceptable.

Using data from permanent sample plots in a tropical moist forest in central Africa and considering four allometric models with equal likelihood, the largest source of error in the estimate of the difference of biomass between intact and <b>logged-over</b> <b>forest</b> was that due to the model choice (40 % of the sum of squares). The error due to the model choice did not cancel out in the difference due to an interaction between the model’s prediction and the diameter structure of the forest. The variability in biomass between plots was the second largest source of error, but was underestimated because of post-stratiﬁcation. The error due to the model choice could be reduced by weighting the models’predictions. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Reliable data on {{the growth}} and yield of <b>logged-over</b> <b>forest</b> to determinesustainable cutting cycles are widely missing for the tropics. We used theprocess-based model Formind 2. 0 to analyse the growth and yield of logged-overforest in Venezuela under {{different}} logging scenarios {{over a period of}} 240 years and compared results with unlogged stands. The performance of the modelwas evaluated with a detailed stability and sensitivity analysis. In theabsence of further logging,the logged-over stand approached the standstructure of mature forest in terms of bole volume and basal area afterabout 50 - 100 years. Thirty-year cutting cycles with conventional loggingmethods and net extraction volumes of 45 and 60 m^ 3 /(ha cycle) did not providesustainable yields under either of two minimum felling diameters(35 or 50 cm) that were applied. Only the 60 -year cutting cycle providedsustainable yields under conventional and reduced-impact logging with thedi minimum felling diameters and a range of net volumes extracted(30 - 60 m^ 3 /(ha cycle). With the longest cutting cycle (60 years), bole volumerecovered to levels similar to the mature unlogged stand, but the speciescomposition was very different. Scenarios with reduced-impact logging provideda significantly higher timber volume than under conventional logging. Theconservation of forest resources will only be possible with long cuttingcycles (at least 60 years) in combination with reduced-impact logging...|$|E
40|$|Présentation de l'éditeur : The multiple-value {{nature of}} forests {{has long been}} {{appreciated}} and used by forest-dependent people in the tropics. Explicitly managing for {{some or all of}} these values, multiple-use forest management, is stipulated in the laws of many countries, but its formal implementation in the tropics is thought to be rare. This paper reports on three regional assessments carried out to identify and draw lessons from on-the-ground initiatives in multiple-use forest management in the Amazon Basin, the Congo Basin and Southeast Asia. In all three regions, information was collected through interviews with country-based forestry experts, forest managers and technicians. A complementary, Web-based questionnaire further examined the reasons for the successes and failures of multiple-use forest management initiatives. The paper concludes that forest managers need more support if they are to realize the potential of multiple-use forest management. Greater effort is needed to eliminate unfair competition from operators whose sole objective is to extract timber, with little or no concern for multiple uses. In most countries, the demarcation of a permanent forest estate and the development of national land-use plans would increase investment in multiple-use forest management. Improving the value of <b>logged-over</b> <b>forest</b> through silviculture would also increase the uptake of multiple-use approache...|$|E
40|$|The carbon (C) {{footprint}} of {{palm oil}} production {{is needed to}} judge emissions from potential biofuel use. Relevance includes wider sustainable palm oil debates. Within life cycle analysis, aboveground C debt is incurred if the vegetation replaced had a higher C stock than oil palm plantations. Our study included 25 plantations across Indonesia, in a stratified study design representing the range of conditions in which oil palm is grown. From allometric equations for palm biomass and observed growth rates, we estimated the time-averaged aboveground C stock for 25 -year rotation and 95 %-confidence interval to be 42. 07 (42. 04 – 42. 10) Mg C ha− 1 for plantations managed by company on mineral soils, 40. 03 (39. 75 – 40. 30) Mg C ha− 1 for plantations managed by company on peat, and 37. 76 (37. 42 – 38. 09) Mg C ha− 1 for smallholder oil palm on mineral soils. Oil palm can be established C debt-free on mineral soils with aboveground C stocks below these values; neutrality of mineral soil C pools was documented in a parallel study. Acknowledging variation in shoot:root ratios, the types of vegetation that can be converted debt-free to oil palm include grasslands and shrub, but not monocultural rubber plantations, rubber agroforest, and similar secondary or <b>logged-over</b> <b>forests</b> of higher C stock...|$|R
40|$|Selective logging {{has been}} taking place in Papua for several decades. In contrast, very {{little is known about}} the stand {{structure}} in post-logged forest. Hence, this paper investigates stand structures in logged-over area of tropical forest in South Papua. Four species were selected in three one-hectare permanent sample plots (PSPs) : Vatica rassak, Syzygium sp, Litsea timoriana and Canarium asperum. PSPs were located in the forest concession area of PT. Tunas Sawaerma in Assiki, Boven Digul, in South Papua. Data sets comprised measurements made in 2005 and 2012 consisting of species, diameter at breast height (DBH), mortality and number of tree of each species. Integral Projection Models (IPMs) were developed, taking into account mortality, growth, recruitment and fecundity. Results show the pattern of stand structures of the four species were more or less similar, i. e. more individual trees were present in the small diameter classes than in the larger diameter classes. The general pattern of the individual distribution of the four species is the typical reverse-J shape. Syzygium sp. has a greater number of individuals in the small diameter classes than the other three species. Population growth rates (λ) are above one, indicating that the stand structures of the population dynamics of the four species are recuperating. Conclusively, these results suggest that species composition and population structure in these <b>logged-over</b> <b>forests</b> are recovering increasingly...|$|R
40|$|Effects of soil {{properties}} {{on growth}} of young tree seedlings of Hopea odorata and Azadirachta excelsa {{in line and}} gap enrichment planting in <b>logged-over</b> tropical lowland <b>forest</b> were evaluated. At 13 months, the trees were grouped into “good” and “poor” growth based on their height increment in the previous 6 months. Organic matter content, penetration resistance, soil texture, thickness of A-horizon, Ca and Mg contents differed significantly between soils with “good” and “poor” growth. Organic matter, thickness of A-horizon, Ca and Mg contents {{were found to be}} significantly higher in “good” growth soils than “poor” ones, but penetration resistance was the reverse. Surface soils under “good” growth had lower clay content and higher sand content compared to that under “poor” growth. Favourable soil conditions for good growth were also manifested in biomass and litter accumulation. The mean dry biomass in the “good” and “poor” growth was 174 and 72 g m- 2 respectively, and for dry litter 300 and 154 g m- 2 respectively. Properties most limiting seedling growth performance were bulk density (mechanical resistance), depth of A-horizon and amount of clay in the surface soil. Correction of these factors is therefore important in ensuring the success of rehabilitation and reforestation of <b>logged-over</b> degraded <b>forest...</b>|$|R
