25|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the day was}} to inspect Atlantiss thermal protection system, using the shuttle's robotic arm and the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) to look for any signs of launch damage. To do so, Commander Ferguson, Pilot Hurley and Mission Specialist Magnus used the shuttle's robotic arm and the OBSS to get a close up look at reinforced carbon–carbon wing leading edges and the nose cap of the shuttle. The robotic arm grappled the OBSS at 6:58a.m. EDT. After raising out the arm-boom assembly, the crew activated the camera and <b>laser</b> <b>sensor</b> package on the boom to first scan the starboard wing. The nose cap was surveyed next followed by the port wing. The gathered visual and electronic data were downlinked during numerous Ku band communication opportunities to the ground. With imagery on their hand, experts began to review the data. The heat shield survey started around 11:00 UTC, was wrapped about five hours later. In his NASA TV commentary, NASA Public Affairs Officer, Rob Navias, said that most of the time, the crew worked ahead of schedule opting to take meals while working. The crew received high praise for their efficient work from the Mission Control Houston including CAPCOM astronaut Stephen Robinson who communicated with them during the survey.|$|E

40|$|Photonic Microdevices/Microstructures for Sensing III, Orlando, FL, 27 - 28 April 2011 Fiber grating <b>laser</b> <b>sensors</b> {{have been}} {{attracting}} interest {{because of their}} high signal-to-noise ratio and narrow linewidth that permit high resolution sensing. According to the working principle, fiber grating <b>laser</b> <b>sensors</b> can be classified into two types: wavelength encoding sensor and polarimetric heterodyning sensor. The former converts measurrand into shift in the operation wavelength of the fiber laser, {{which is similar to}} that of fiber grating sensor. The latter converts measurrant into change in beat frequency between the two orthogonal polarization modes from the laser. Because the beat frequency is in radio frequency (RF) range, the polarimetric heterodyning sensor has distinctive advantages of ease of interrogation and avoidance of expensive wavelength measurement that is required for wavelength encoding sensors. In this paper, we report some of our recent works in fabrication of dual-polarization fiber grating lasers, development of polarimetric heterodyning fiber grating <b>laser</b> <b>sensors</b> for measurement of acoustic wave, acceleration, lateral force, displacement, electric current and hydrostatic pressure, and sensor multiplexing in RF domain.

40|$|The {{majority}} of modern production processes {{has reached a}} high degree of automation. The involved process steps as well as the quality of the manufactured products have to be inspected on a routine basis. Online measurements offer the shortest possible reaction times for process control. Laser measuring methods are predestinated for this task: no mechanical contact to the specimen is required, high measuring speed, independence of ambient light, fast adaptation to varying technical surfaces of the specimens. During the last years, <b>laser</b> <b>sensors</b> for the determination of geometric features of workpieces were developed achieving a high level of performance for online measurements in terms of precision and measuring frequency. Furthermore the progress in signal processing, data evaluation and data assessment has accelerated the trend to completely automated inspection systems based on laser measuring technology.
