5|$|More serious {{complications}} include <b>laryngospasm,</b> perforation of the trachea or esophagus, pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents {{or other}} foreign bodies, fracture or dislocation of the cervical spine, temporomandibular joint or arytenoid cartilages, decreased oxygen content, elevated arterial carbon dioxide, and vocal cord weakness. In {{addition to these}} complications, tracheal intubation via the nasal route carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and potentially severe nasal bleeding. Newer technologies such as flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy have fared better in reducing the incidence {{of some of these}} complications, though the most frequent cause of intubation trauma remains a lack of skill {{on the part of the}} laryngoscopist.|$|E
5|$|Complications {{may also}} be severe and {{long-lasting}} or permanent, such as vocal cord damage, esophageal perforation and retropharyngeal abscess, bronchial intubation, or nerve injury. They may even be immediately life-threatening, such as <b>laryngospasm</b> and negative pressure pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), aspiration, unrecognized esophageal intubation, or accidental disconnection or dislodgement of the tracheal tube. Potentially fatal complications more often associated with prolonged intubation and/or tracheotomy include abnormal communication between the trachea and nearby structures such as the innominate artery (tracheoinnominate fistula) or esophagus (tracheoesophageal fistula). Other significant complications include airway obstruction due to loss of tracheal rigidity, ventilator-associated pneumonia and narrowing of the glottis or trachea. The cuff pressure is monitored carefully {{in order to avoid}} complications from over-inflation, many of which can be traced to excessive cuff pressure restricting the blood supply to the tracheal mucosa. A 2000 Spanish study of bedside percutaneous tracheotomy reported overall complication rates of 10–15% and procedural mortality of 0%, which is comparable to those of other series reported in the literature from the Netherlands and the United States.|$|E
25|$|An {{unconscious}} diver loses voluntary bodily control, {{but still}} has protective reflexes that protect the airway. One {{of these is}} <b>laryngospasm,</b> which closes the larynx to prevent water from entering the lungs. After some time a <b>laryngospasm</b> will relax and the airway will open. If the diver has reached the surface and the diver's face is kept above water, when the <b>laryngospasm</b> relaxes spontaneous breathing will often resume.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, <b>laryngospasms</b> {{can result}} from hypocalcemia, causing muscle spasms and/or tetany. Na+ {{channels}} remain open {{even if there is}} very little increase in the membrane potential. This affects the small muscles of the vocal folds.|$|R

25|$|A {{continued}} lack {{of oxygen}} in the brain, hypoxia, will quickly render a person unconscious usually around a blood partial pressure of oxygen of 25–30 mmHg. An unconscious person rescued with an airway still sealed from <b>laryngospasm</b> stands {{a good chance of}} a full recovery. Artificial respiration is also much more effective without water in the lungs. At this point the person stands a good chance of recovery if attended to within minutes. More than 10% of drownings may involve <b>laryngospasm,</b> but the evidence suggests that it is not usually effective at preventing water from entering the trachea. The lack of water found in lungs during autopsy does not necessarily mean there was no water at the time of drowning, as small amounts of freshwater are readily absorbed into the bloodstream. Hypercarbia and hypoxia both contribute to laryngeal relaxation, after which the airway is effectively open through the trachea. There is also bronchospasm and mucous production in the bronchi associated with <b>laryngospasm,</b> and these may prevent water entry at terminal relaxation.|$|E
25|$|If the diver {{is still}} {{underwater}} when the <b>laryngospasm</b> relaxes, then water {{will enter the}} airway and may reach the lungs, which will cause complications even if resuscitation is successful. Secondary drowning may occur as a result.|$|E
50|$|Swallowing {{difficulties}} (dysphagia) are not commonly seen in {{vocal fold}} paresis {{that results from}} RLN damage. Dysphagia may however, suggest SLN damage. Symptoms of sensory nerve damage include: chronic coughing, the feeling of having a lump in the throat (globus sensation), hypersensitivity or abnormal sensation, spasms of the vocal folds (<b>laryngospasms),</b> dysphagia, pain from vocal use, and voice loss in high pitch ranges. It is possible for both the RLN and the SLN to be damaged simultaneously, so the symptoms of RLN and SLN damage may be seen independently or alongside one another.|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} {{induction}} of general anesthesia produced by ketamine and propofol, 2 {{of the most}} commonly used anaesthetic agents in cats, was assessed. Eighteen cats admitted for elective procedures were randomly assigned to 3 groups and then premedicated with xylazine 0. 75 mg/kg intramuscularly before anaesthesia was induced with ketamine 15 mg/kg intramuscularly (KetIM group), ketamine 10 mg/kg intravenously (KetIV group) or propofol 4 mg/kg intravenously (PropIV group). Quality of induction of general anaesthesia was determined by scoring ease of intubation, degree of struggling, and vocalisation during the induction period. The quality of induction of anaesthesia of intramuscularly administered ketamine was inferior to that of intravenously administered ketamine, while intravenously administered propofol showed little difference in quality of induction from ketamine administered by both the intramuscular and intravenous routes. There {{were no significant differences between}} groups in the ease of intubation scores, while vocalisation and struggling were more common in cats that received ketamine intramuscularly than in those that received intravenously administered ketamine or propofol for induction of anaesthesia. <b>Laryngospasms</b> occurred in 2 cats that received propofol. The heart rates and respiratory rates decreased after xylazine premedication and either remained the same or decreased further after induction for all 3 groups, but remained within normal acceptable limits. This study indicates that the 3 regimens are associated with acceptable induction characteristics, but administration of ketamine intravenously is superior to its administration intramuscularly and laryngeal desensitisation is recommended to avoid <b>laryngospasms...</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Spontaneous ventilation, {{mechanical}} controlled ventilation, apneic intermittent ventilation, and {{jet ventilation}} {{are commonly used}} during interventional suspension microlaryngoscopy. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate specific complications of each technique, with special emphasis on transtracheal and transglottal jet ventilation. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective single-institution analysis of a case series of 1, 093 microlaryngoscopies performed in 661 patients between January 1994 and January 2004. Data were collected from two separate prospective databases. Feasibility and complications encountered with each technique of ventilation were analyzed as main outcome measures. RESULTS: During 1, 093 suspension microlaryngoscopies, ventilation was supplied by mechanical controlled ventilation via small endotracheal tubes (n = 200), intermittent apneic ventilation (n = 159), transtracheal jet ventilation (n = 265), or transglottal jet ventilation (n = 469). Twenty-nine minor and 4 major complications occurred. Seventy-five percent of the patients with major events had an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification of III. Five <b>laryngospasms</b> were observed with apneic intermittent ventilation. All other 24 complications (including 7 barotrauma) occurred during jet ventilation. Transtracheal jet ventilation was associated with a significantly higher complication rate than transglottal jet ventilation (P < 0. 0001; odds ratio, 4. 3 [95 % confidence interval, 1. 9 - 10. 0]). All severe complications were related to barotraumas resulting from airway outflow obstruction during jet ventilation, most often <b>laryngospasms.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The use of a transtracheal cannula was the major independent risk factor for complications during jet ventilation for interventional microlaryngoscopy. The anesthetist's vigilance in clinically detecting and preventing outflow airway obstruction remains the best prevention of barotrauma during subglottic jet ventilation...|$|R

40|$|Flexible {{laryngeal}} mask airways (FLMAs) {{have been widely}} used in thyroidectomy as well as cleft palate, nasal, upper chest, head and neck oncoplastic surgeries. This systematic review aims to compare the incidence of airway complications that occur during and after general anesthesia when using the FLMA and endotracheal intubation (ETT). We performed a quantitative meta-analysis of the results of randomized trials. A comprehensive search of the PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases was conducted using the key words "flexible {{laryngeal mask}} airway" and "endotracheal intubation". Only prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the FLMA and ETT were included. The relative risks (RRs) and the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were calculated using a quality effects model in MetaXL 1. 3 software to analyze the outcome data. Ten RCTs were included in this meta-analysis. There {{were no significant differences between}} the FLMA and ETT groups in the incidence of difficulty in positioning the airway [RR = 1. 75, 95 % CI = (0. 70 - 4. 40) ]; the occurrence of sore throat at one hour and 24 hours postoperative [RR = 0. 90, 95 % CI = (0. 13 - 6. 18) and RR = 0. 95, 95 % CI = (0. 81 - 1. 13), respectively]; <b>laryngospasms</b> [RR = 0. 58, 95 % CI = (0. 27 - 1. 23) ]; airway displacement [RR = 2. 88, 95 % CI = (0. 58 - 14. 33) ]; aspiration [RR = 0. 76, 95 % CI = (0. 06 - 8. 88) ]; or laryngotracheal soiling [RR = 0. 34, 95 % CI = (0. 10 - 1. 06) ]. Patients treated with the FLMA had a lower incidence of hoarseness [RR = 0. 31, 95 % CI = (0. 15 - 0. 62) ]; coughing [RR = 0. 28, 95 % CI = (0. 15 - 0. 51) ] during recovery in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU); and oxygen desaturation [RR = 0. 43, 95 % CI = (0. 26 - 0. 72) ] than did patients treated with ETT. However, the incidence of partial upper airway obstruction in FLMA patients was significantly greater than it was for ETT patients [RR = 4. 01, 95 % CI = (1. 44 - 11. 18) ]. This systematic review showed that the FLMA has some advantages over ETT because it results in a lower incidence of hoarseness, coughing and oxygen desaturation. There were no statistically significant differences in the difficulty of intubation or in the occurrence of <b>laryngospasms,</b> postoperative sore throat, airway displacement, aspiration or laryngotracheal soiling. However, there was a higher incidence of partial upper airway obstruction in the FLMA than in the ETT group. We conclude that the FLMA has some advantages over ETT, but surgeons and anesthesiologists should be cautious when applying the mouth gag, moving the head and neck, or performing oropharyngeal procedures to avoid partial upper airway obstruction and airway displacement. The FLMA should not be used on patients at high risk for aspiration...|$|R
