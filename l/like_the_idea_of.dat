5|$|The first volume, Into the Wild, {{was written}} by Kate Cary under the {{pseudonym}} Erin Hunter, and completed in about three months. Holmes continued to act behind the scenes editing and supervising details. Afterwards, Holmes began to <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> using cats since she realized how thoughtful they can be leading private lives without any humans realizing.|$|E
5|$|In 1669, Anna Maria Luisa was {{considered}} as a potential bride to Louis, le Grand Dauphin, the heir-apparent of Louis XIV of France. Cosimo III did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a French marriage, and never devoted himself fully to the cause (she was later rejected). Instead, Cosimo offered her to his first choice, Peter II of Portugal. Peter's ministers, fearing that Princess Anna Maria Luisa would dominate Peter II and fearing she might have inherited Marguerite Louise’s manner, declined. In fact, contemporaries thought her traits to {{be a combination of}} those of her father and paternal grandmother, Vittoria della Rovere.|$|E
5|$|O'Donoghue complained {{directly}} to Belushi {{that he thought}} his parody of Shatner during the dress rehearsals was inadequate and needed much improvement. Further, actor Chevy Chase was annoyed that he was satirizing Leonard Nimoy as Spock; he did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> playing second-fiddle to Belushi. During all of the rehearsals, Chase attempted to attract more attention to his character's role and dominate the scene. Just prior to the actual on-air performance of the sketch, O'Donoghue admonished Belushi and implored him to perform an effective parody. Belushi's dress rehearsal performance had worried executives {{so much that they}} had discussed canceling the entire sketch altogether.|$|E

5|$|According to a podcast {{interview}} with Chris Jericho, Copeland {{said that he}} did not initially <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the ladder match and even told WWE management not to include him on the Wrestlemania 21 card altogether. However, he was talked into competing by the other participants like Jericho and Glenn Jacobs (Kane) who said the match had {{the potential to be a}} big success. At Backlash, Edge defeated Chris Benoit in a Last Man Standing match to end the feud. Several weeks after, Edge was then paired with Lita, his real-life girlfriend at the time, in an angle in which she betrayed her storyline husband Kane, by costing him a number-one contender match for the World Heavyweight Championship. Edge faced even more scorn from fans due to this relationship, which lasted over a year. The next week, Edge received his World Heavyweight Championship match against Batista, which he lost. Edge started a feud with Kane leading to several matches between them including one at Vengeance, when Edge lost to Kane. After trading several victories on Raw, the feud ended in a stretcher match on the July 25 episode of Raw that Edge won, but shortly after, Kane performed a tombstone piledriver on Lita.|$|E
5|$|In early July 1915, {{while making}} {{plans for an}} {{offensive}} to break the deadlock that had developed around the Gallipoli Peninsula following the initial landings in April, {{the commander of the}} Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, Lieutenant General William Birdwood, had determined that an attack at Lone Pine could be used to divert Ottoman attention away from a main attack that would be launched further north around Sari Bair, Chunuk Bair and Hill 971. The Australian 1st Infantry Brigade was chosen to undertake the attack, and consisted of about 3,000 men, under the command of Colonel Nevill Smyth. Along with the 2nd and 3rd Infantry Brigades, the 1st Infantry Brigade was part of the Australian 1st Division. The division's commander was Brigadier General Harold Walker, a British officer who had replaced Major General William Bridges as temporary commander after Bridges had been killed by a sniper in May. Walker did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> launching an attack at Lone Pine, let alone a mere diversion, but when General Sir Ian Hamilton, the British commander, insisted the attack proceed, through thorough planning, Walker endeavoured to give his troops the best chance of success possible on such an unfavourable battleground.|$|E

Arjuna and Bhishma again {{engaged in a}} fierce duel, however Arjuna's heart {{was not in the}} battle as he did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> attacking his grand-uncle. During the battle, Bhishma killed numerous soldiers of Arjuna's armies.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1934 Lombardi's roommate Jim Lawlor {{introduced}} him to his cousin's relative, Marie Planitz. When Marie announced her ardent desire to marry Lombardi, her status-conscious stockbroker father didn't <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> his daughter marrying {{the son of an}} Italian butcher from Brooklyn, a prejudice he would face more than once in his life. Lombardi and Marie wed, nonetheless, on August 31, 1940.|$|E
25|$|I do support getting animals out in {{the same}} way I would have {{supported}} getting human slaves out, child labor, sex slaves, the whole lot. But I don't support burning. I don't support arson. I would rather that these buildings weren't standing, so on some level I understand. I just don't <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> that. Maybe that is wishy-washy of me, because I don't want those buildings standing {{if they are going to}} hurt anyone. And the ALF has never hurt mice nor mare.|$|E

25|$|Even in {{planning}} stages, various Florida-based animal rights groups and PETA did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Disney creating {{a theme park}} where animals were held in captivity. The groups protested, and PETA tried to convince travel agents not to book trips to the park. A {{few weeks before the}} park opened, a number of animals died due to accidents. The United States Department of Agriculture viewed most of the cases and found no violations of animal-welfare regulations. On opening day, the Orange County Sheriff's office sent about 150 deputies; about two dozen protesters showed up. The protest lasted two hours, and there were no arrests.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s {{there was an}} {{exchange}} between judges and academics in the United Kingdom and United States comparing the process of appeal used in both nations. Although the British judges found the emphasis on written arguments unattractive, they did <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> pre-reading; that the court should read the pleadings of counsel, the case being appealed and the judgment from the lower court before delivering their judgment. After a trial in the Court of Appeal, despite the success of this, the idea was quietly scrapped. The court which Lord Denning presided over from 1962 to 1982 was under no pressure and had no inclination to modernise, with liaisons and management handled by clerks with little knowledge. This changed in 1981 with {{the appointment of a}} Registrar, John Adams, an academic and lawyer, who significantly reformed the internal workings of the Court.|$|E
25|$|He {{attempted}} {{to increase the}} Congress base by bringing in more farmers, townspeople and Muslims between 1886 and 1887 and this created a backlash from the British, leading to backtracking by the Congress. Hume was disappointed when Congress opposed moves to raise the age of marriage for Indian girls and failed to focus on issues of poverty. Some Indian princes did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> democracy and some organizations like the United Indian Patriotic Association went about trying to undermine the Congress by showing it as an organization with a seditious character. In 1892, {{he tried to get}} them to act by warning of a violent agrarian revolution but this only outraged the British establishment and frightened the Congress leaders. Disappointed by the continued lack of Indian leaders willing to work for the cause of national emancipation, Hume left for Britain in 1894.|$|E

25|$|After a {{few months}} of being together, happy and in love, Robin has a {{pregnancy}} scare. Although the test is negative, she realizes she wants different things from life than Patrick. She wants more from him (children), while he is happy just the way they are. They eventually break up. Robin wants to be a mother and decides to be a single mom. She and her friend, Dr. Kelly Lee (Minae Noji), put a list of possible sperm donors together. Robin picks people in Port Charles, because she feels that they have redeeming qualities she will like to pass on to her child, and does not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> her child's father being a stranger. On November 30, 2007, Patrick tells Robin that he still loves and misses her. He just wants them to be together again and asks her to table the discussion of children for a year, and while she has stated that she has never been happier than when she was with him, she knows nothing would be different in a year - she would still want kids and he would not, to which he sadly replies that she is probably right, {{but it would have been}} a great year.|$|E
500|$|Feeling {{detached}} from the early 1980s mainstream gay culture, Morrissey wrote [...] "This Charming Man" [...] to evoke an older, more coded and self-aware underground scene. The singer said of the song's lyrics: [...] "I really <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the male voice being quite vulnerable, of it being taken and slightly manipulated, rather than there being always this heavy machismo thing that just bores everybody." ...|$|E
500|$|Marshall {{was born}} in Franklin, Louisiana. [...] He was the oldest of seven children, whose father, Leonard Marshall Sr., was a foreman at a shipyard. Initially, Marshall's father did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> his son playing football, as {{he thought it was}} [...] "a stupid game" [...] that would prevent him son from doing more {{productive}} things. [...] Later in his life however, Marshall Sr. expressed happiness over his son's success, and even rooted against his beloved Dallas Cowboys when his son's Giants teams played them.|$|E

500|$|Fernandez {{reporting}} Gaga's {{opinion in}} an interview said that Gaga herself said it smelled good, because it smelled like meat. The designer talked {{of what was to}} happen to the dress after the awards show, [...] "The dress will be put in an archive with all of her dresses. The Gaga Archives, I suppose. It won't last, that's the beauty of it. When it is brought out again, hopefully it will be in a retrospective, {{and it will be a}} different dress, which is the best thing. I <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> it changing and evolving into something else". He later explained that the dress would be preserved and made into a type of jerky before being archived.|$|E
500|$|The {{creation}} of Jason Teague was something handed {{down by the}} network, who wanted Lana {{to have a new}} boyfriend—one who was [...] "different from Clark". Gough and Millar were apprehensive because they were already introducing Lois Lane into the series, and introducing two new characters would be difficult. The pair thought about where the relationship between Clark and Lana had left off at the end of season three, and they realized that Clark had turned his back on Lana. Gough and Millar began to <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> bringing in a new character, one that would create a new love triangle; eventually they tied him into the larger storyline involving the three Kryptonian stones of knowledge.|$|E
500|$|Kneale's next {{television}} series was {{a departure from}} his usual style—Kinvig, his sole attempt at writing a sitcom, produced by London Weekend Television and broadcast on ITV {{in the autumn of}} 1981. Although his first out-and-out comedy, Kneale was keen to stress that there had always been elements of humour present throughout his scripts, and some of the press reaction to Kinvig was positive. [...] "If you <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the Hitch-Hiker's Guide but found its realization tiresomely hysterical you may well prefer Kneale's relaxed wit. Cast splendid, direction deft," [...] was The Timess preview of the first episode. However, the series was not a success, although Kneale later remained personally pleased with it.|$|E
