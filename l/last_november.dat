The fight took place on 7 May 2016, at the new T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The bout was on HBO PPV. Golden Boy Promotions expected the fight to bring in 2 million PPV buys. Canelo was likely to be getting a career payday against Khan because this is a fight that will almost surely bring in more PPV buys on HBO than Canelo's last fight against Miguel Cotto <b>last</b> <b>November.</b> That fight brought in 900,000 PPV buys on HBO. Khan eventually lost to Álvarez by way of knockout in Round 6. Although many believe Khan was ahead on points including ESPN, two of the ringside judges had Canelo ahead after five round (49-46 & 48-47), the third judge had Khan ahead (48-47). With the scorecards heading towards a split decision halfway through the fight, Khan admitted, [...] "it may have been a blessing being knocked out in the 6th round, rather than an upset loss on the scorecards after 12 rounds. According to CompuBox, Alvarez landed 64 of 170 (38 percent) and Khan landed 48 of 166 punches (29 percent), though only one of their shots really mattered.|$|E

2500|$|The 2003 season {{also saw}} the first (though only subtle) change to the 1996-style uniform. On both white and green jerseys, black shadows and silver trim were added to both the green and white numbering. The stripe on the pants changed from black-green-black to black-silver-green on the white pants, and from a solid black stripe to one stripe of black, another of silver, with one small white stripe in between for the midnight blue pants. The 2003 season {{also saw the}} team debut black {{alternate}} jerseys, with a green (instead of black) shadow on white numbers, and silver trim. These black jerseys have been worn for two selected home games each season (usually the first home game after bye week and the season finale). In the 2003 and 2004 regular-season home finales, the team wore the green road pants with the black alternate jerseys, but lost each game. Since then, the Eagles have only worn the black jerseys with the white pants. However, due to the special 75th anniversary uniforms serving as the [...] "alternates" [...] for one game in 2007, the Eagles could not wear the alternate black jersey that season per league rules (alternate uniforms are permitted twice per season but only one can be used). The black jerseys with white pants, however, re-appeared for the 2008 Thanksgiving night game against the Arizona Cardinals. The black jerseys were most recently used in a December 21, 2016 game against the New York Giants, in which they won 24-19. From 2006–2013, the Eagles have only worn the alternate black jerseys once a season and for the <b>last</b> <b>November</b> home game, but did not use them in 2007, 2010, and 2011.

The team also started wearing black shoes exclusively in 2004. Since 2014, the Eagles have worn the black jersey twice per season. In 2016, they wore the black jersey three times.|$|E
