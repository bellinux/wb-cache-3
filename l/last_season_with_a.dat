500|$|Ruth {{had kept}} up {{his efforts to}} stay in shape in 1923 and 1924, but by early 1925 weighed nearly [...] His annual visit to Hot Springs, Arkansas, where he {{exercised}} and took saunas early in the year, did him no good as he spent much of the time carousing in the resort town. He became ill while there, and suffered relapses during spring training. Ruth collapsed in Asheville, North Carolina, as the team journeyed north. He was put on a train for New York, where he was briefly hospitalized. A rumor circulated that he had died, prompting British newspapers to print a premature obituary. In New York, Ruth collapsed again and was found unconscious in his hotel bathroom. He was taken to a hospital where he suffered multiple convulsions. After sportswriter W. O. McGeehan wrote that Ruth's illness was due to binging on hot dogs and soda pop before a game, it became known as [...] "the bellyache heard 'round the world". However, the exact cause of his ailment has never been confirmed and remains a mystery. Glenn Stout, in his history of the Yankees, notes that the Ruth legend is [...] "still one of the most sheltered in sports"; he suggests that alcohol was at the root of Ruth's illness, pointing to the fact that Ruth remained six weeks at St. Vincent's Hospital but was allowed to leave, under supervision, for workouts with the team for part of that time. He concludes that the hospitalization was behavior-related. Playing just 98 games, Ruth had his worst season as a Yankee; he finished with a [...]290 average and 25 home runs. The Yankees finished next to last in the AL with a 69–85 record, their <b>last</b> <b>season</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> losing record until 1965.|$|E

[...] Those wins made sure that the Gulls spent the whole of August at the top of the League Two table.|$|E
