25|$|A few knots {{have become}} more or less {{standard}} for attaching the {{various parts of the}} fly lines and backing, etc., together. A detailed discussion of most of these knots is available in any good book on fly fishing. Some of the knots that are in most every fly angler's arsenal are: the improved clinch knot which is commonly used to attach the fly to the leader, the overhand slip knot or arbor knot which is used to attach the backing to the spool, the albright knot which can be used to attach the fly line to the backing. A loop can also be put in fly line backing using a bimini twist. Often, a loop is added to the business end of the fly line to facilitate the connection to the leader. This loop may take one of several forms. It may be formed by creating a loop in the end of the fly line itself or by adding a braided loop or a loop of monofilament nylon (as in Gray's Loop). Alternatively, a single length of monofilament nylon, or fluorocarbon, may be tied {{to the end of the}} fly line using a nail or tube knot or a needle knot. A loop can then be tied at the end of this monofilament butt length or butt section using a double surgeon's knot or a perfection loop, to which the tapered or untapered leader, also looped using a double surgeon's knot or a perfection loop, may in turn be connected via a loop to <b>loop</b> <b>connection.</b> The use of loop to loop connections between the fly line and the leader provides a quick and convenient way to change or replace a tapered leader. Many commercially produced tapered leaders come with a pre-tied <b>loop</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|E

Additionally, the repeatable formability and weldability of thermoplastics enables adapted joining techniques like warm-shaped <b>loop</b> <b>connections.</b> This paper covers studies on the manufacturing of <b>loop</b> <b>connections,</b> performed during stamp forming of the composite structure. Simple loop joints with flat welding zones are analysed both, experimentally and numerically. Based on that, improvement strategies to optimise the loading behaviour are discussed and <b>loop</b> <b>connections</b> with profiled welding zones are designed to improve the peel resistance. For validation of the design concept, numerical analyses are conducted using an enhanced material definition including failure mode dependent stiffness degradation. Additional processing studies and mechanical tests are used to evaluate the adapted joint design, demonstrating the improved load bearing behaviour...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} successive {{firing of}} the stellate cells within a theta cycle, which replicates the phase coding of place information, using a network {{model of the}} entorhinal cortex layer II with <b>loop</b> <b>connections.</b> Layer II of the entorhinal cortex (ECII) sends signals to the hippocampus, and the hippocampus sends signals back to layer V of the entorhinal cortex (ECV). In addition to this major pathway, projection from ECV to ECII also exists. It is, therefore, inferred that reverberation activity readily appears if projections from ECV to ECII are potentiated. The frequency of the reverberation {{would be in a}} gamma range because it takes signals 20 – 30  ms to go around the entorhinal-hippocampal loop circuits. On the other hand, {{it has been suggested that}} ECII is a theta rhythm generator. If the reverberation activity appears in the entorhinal-hippocampal loop circuits, gamma oscillation would be superimposed on a theta rhythm in ECII like a gamma-theta oscillation. This is a reminiscence of the theta phase coding of place information. In this paper, first, a network model of ECII will be developed in order to reproduce a theta rhythm. Secondly, we will show that <b>loop</b> <b>connections</b> from one stellate cell to the other one are selectively potentiated by afferent signals to ECII. Frequencies of those afferent signals are different, and transmission delay of the <b>loop</b> <b>connections</b> is 20  ms. As a result, stellate cells fire successively within one cycle of the theta rhythm. This resembles gamma-theta oscillation underlying the phase coding. Our model also replicates the phase precession of stellate cell firing within a cycle of subthreshold oscillation (theta rhythm) ...|$|R

50|$|Stump blow-out, or {{duodenal}} blow-out, is the leakage of {{the blind}} end of the duodenum. It occurs as a complication of Billroth II gastrectomy, usually on {{the fourth or fifth}} day after surgery. It is due to improper closure of duodenal stump, especially when the duodenum is inflamed and oedematous. It can also occur because of afferent loop block, local pancreatitis and distal obstruction.The patient who was previously convalescing satisfactorily may suddenly present with severe abdominal pain, fever and shock-like state. Jaundice may develop within 48 hours owing to the absorption of bile from peritoneal cavity. If the abdomen is drained, bile-stained fluid may be seen emerging at the drain site.Intravenous fluids should be started and adequate surgical drainage should be provided.

40|$|Spike-timing-dependent {{synaptic}} plasticity (STDP) {{is a simple}} and effective learning rule for sequence learning. However, synapses being subject to STDP rules are readily influenced in noisy circumstances because synaptic conductances are modified by pre- and postsynaptic spikes elicited within a few tens of milliseconds, regardless of whether those spikes convey information or not. Noisy firing existing everywhere in the brain may induce irrelevant enhancement of synaptic connections through STDP rules and would result in uncertain memory encoding and obscure memory patterns. We will here show that the LTD windows of the STDP rules enable robust sequence learning amid background noise in cooperation with a large signal transmission delay between neurons and a theta rhythm, using a network model of the entorhinal cortex layer II with entorhinal-hippocampal <b>loop</b> <b>connections.</b> The important element of the present model for robust sequence learning amid background noise is the symmetric STDP rule having LTD windows {{on both sides of}} the LTP window, in addition to the <b>loop</b> <b>connections</b> having a large signal transmission delay and the theta rhythm pacing activities of stellate cells. Above all, the LTD window in the range of positive spike-timing is important to prevent influences of noise with the progress of sequence learning...|$|R

40|$|From 2010 to 2015, MwRSF {{researchers}} {{developed the}} RESTORE barrier, {{which is a}} restorable MASH TL- 4 median barrier with a steel and concrete rail supported by elastomer posts and steel skids. The research effort reported herein describes the initial development of a transition from the RESTORE barrier to a rigid TL- 4 concrete buttress. The previously-developed RESTORE barrier LS-DYNA model was validated against three full-scale vehicle crash tests. Several design concepts were generated {{through a series of}} brainstorming efforts. The primary transition concept consisted of a pin and <b>loop</b> <b>connection</b> between the RESTORE barrier and rigid concrete buttress, which was designed and evaluated with LS-DYNA computer simulation. Vehicle and system behavior were investigated using MASH test designation nos. 4 - 20, 4 - 21, and 4 - 22. Six horizontal gusset plates and drop-down pin allowed for limited deflection and rotation at the transition joint, but provided shear continuity between the two systems. A rounded-edge cover plate mitigated vehicle snag on the transition joint hardware. Eleven impact points were evaluated with each vehicle model to determine critical impact points for use in a future full-scale crash testing program. All occupant risk measures and vehicle stability were within MASH limits. Further design modifications are recommended to limit stresses in the transition joint hardware and to reduce excessive occupant compartment deformation that occurred when the small car impacted the concrete buttress end.

Branchial unit is classified as a dendrobranchia type, and shows externally a sack-like shape. Its structural components are a central axis, primary gill filaments and finer gill filaments which diverge from the primary ones. Afferent and efferent vessels run in pairs along the central axis, braching out at each entrance of primary gill filaments to those distal ends of still more diverged filaments. At the tips of filaments, each of vascular ducts forms a <b>loop</b> <b>connection</b> between afferent and efferent vessels.
