5|$|Having {{been elected}} twice to the presidency, Reagan {{reshaped}} the Republican party, led the modern conservative movement, and altered the political {{dynamic of the}} United States. His 1980 presidential campaign stressed some of his fundamental principles: <b>lower</b> <b>taxes</b> to stimulate the economy, less government interference in people's lives, states' rights, and a strong national defense.|$|E
5|$|In 1862 he was {{appointed}} abbot of the Surb Karapet Monastery near Mush, which meant {{he was also the}} prelate of Taron. He revitalized the monastery and transformed it into a flourishing center. He founded a school there and a journal, called Artsvik Tarono. He succeeded in convincing the wali (governor) of the Erzurum Vilayet to <b>lower</b> <b>taxes</b> for Armenians.|$|E

5000|$|The Laffer {{curve is}} one of the main {{theoretical}} constructs of supply-side economics. It is the idea that <b>lowering</b> <b>tax</b> rates may generate more government revenue than would otherwise be expected at the <b>lower</b> <b>tax</b> rate because moving off of a prohibitively high tax system could generate more economic activity, which would lead to increased opportunities for tax revenues. Economists are divided on whether <b>lowering</b> <b>tax</b> rates is a viable model, and critics typically charge either that there has never been a time when a tax-rate cut caused economic growth or that [...] "now" [...] is not such a time.|$|R
5|$|Thatcher began {{attending}} lunches {{regularly at}} the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), {{a think tank}} founded by Hayekian poultry magnate Antony Fisher; she had been visiting the IEA and reading its publications since the early 1960s. There she {{was influenced by the}} ideas of Ralph Harris and Arthur Seldon, and became the face of the ideological movement opposing the British welfare state. Keynesian economics, they believed, was weakening Britain. The institute's pamphlets proposed less government, <b>lower</b> <b>taxes,</b> and more freedom for business and consumers.|$|E
5|$|The town {{voted in}} October 2007 {{to secede from}} the region of Veneto and join the {{neighbouring}} region, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. This was motivated by improved cultural ties with the small Ladin-speaking community in South Tyrol and the attraction of <b>lower</b> <b>taxes.</b> The referendum is not executive and a final decision on the matter can only be taken by law of the Italian parliament with consent of both regional councils of Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige.|$|E
5|$|While {{the party}} did not {{maintain}} a full slate of policy positions, its candidates advocated {{for increasing the}} number of police in Richmond, especially along the SkyTrain route, protection of green spaces, support for affordable housing, and trade missions with China. They were generally in favour of <b>lower</b> <b>taxes</b> but with more spending on senior services and education. In the 2009 provincial election they campaigned against the carbon tax which the governing BC Liberal Party had implemented the previous year.|$|E

5|$|The treaty only allows {{taxation}} to {{the extent}} that it covers the cost of administrating the archipelago and covering the services provided to the residents. The tax rate is therefore significantly lower than in Metropolitan Norway, including the absence of value added tax. The government summarizes its expenses on Svalbard in the Svalbard Budget. The taxation rules made Svalbard a tax paradise, and in 2009 the oil rig operator Seadrill established a subsidiary in Longyearbyen to exploit the <b>lower</b> <b>taxes.</b> In 2011, the tax rate for profits exceeding NOK10 million were raised from 16 to 28 percent—the same as on the mainland.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns's {{political}} advisers {{break the}} news to Mr. Burns that he is greatly despised by many people while Bailey is beloved by all. To compensate for this, they force Mr. Burns to try being friendly and even smile. Mr. Burns makes a television commercial discussing Blinky with an actor portraying Charles Darwin, who claims Blinky is an evolutionary step and not a mutated fish. Combined with a promise to <b>lower</b> <b>taxes</b> and a smear campaign against Bailey, Mr. Burns ties {{with her in the}} polls. On the night before the election, Mr. Burns's advisers suggest that Mr. Burns have dinner at the home of a middle-class family as an opportunity to put himself in the lead. Mr. Burns scans his employees for the most average man he can find, and Homer is chosen.|$|E
5|$|A MD 30 bypass of Hampstead {{has been}} {{contemplated}} since the 1940s and planned {{since at least}} 1960. The heavy traffic along the highway consisted of three types of highway users: local traffic made up {{of people who had}} moved to Hampstead or Manchester for the municipalities' small-town charm; regional traffic comprising people who had moved to Pennsylvania for cheaper housing and <b>lower</b> <b>taxes</b> but continued to work in the Baltimore area; and truck traffic serving local industry and making connections between Baltimore and Hanover. The increase in congestion on MD 30 accelerated with the completion of I-795 in 1987. By the early 1990s, it took as long as 15 minutes for motorists to pass through each of the towns during rush hour; an average of 20,000 to 25,000 motorists used the highway through Hampstead each day by 2001. Progress toward construction of the bypass was continually delayed. The bypass was removed from MDSHA plans by 1979. The Hampstead Bypass had returned to state plans by 1990, when engineering and design work was underway and construction was planned to begin in 1992. However, in 1991, the bypass was shelved for six years for lack of funding.|$|E

Both these organizations advocate for <b>lower</b> <b>taxes</b> for everyone including the wealthy. In 2006, Van Hollen {{received a}} 100% rating from Citizens for Tax Justice (CTJ), {{a group that}} calls for higher taxes on the wealthy. Van Hollen opposes eliminating the federal estate tax.|$|E
25|$|The Centre is {{represented}} by the Lieutenant Governor, who resides at the Raj Nivas (Le Palais du Gouverneur) at the Park, the former palace of the French governor. The central government is more directly involved in the territory's financial well-being unlike states, which have a central grant that they administer. Consequently, Puducherry has at various times, enjoyed <b>lower</b> <b>taxes,</b> especially in the indirect category.|$|E
5000|$|In theory, the {{government}} collects no revenue at either zero or 100% tax rates. So {{there is some}} intermediate point at which government revenue is maximized. <b>Lowering</b> <b>tax</b> rates from 100% to this hypothetical rate that maximizes revenue would theoretically raise revenue, while continuing to <b>lower</b> <b>tax</b> rates below this rate would lower revenues. This concept underlies the Laffer Curve, an element of supply-side economics. Since the 1970s, some [...] "supply side" [...] economists have contended that <b>lowering</b> marginal <b>tax</b> rates could stimulate economic growth {{to such a degree}} that tax revenues could rise, other factors being held constant.|$|R

The government conceded that if the [...] "facts and circumstances" [...] test was the appropriate test, then Baxter's activity would constitute a trade or business, resulting in the <b>lower</b> <b>tax</b> rate and a <b>lower</b> <b>tax</b> liability.|$|R

25|$|World War II {{constituted}} New York's {{last great}} industrial era. At its conclusion, {{the defense industry}} shrank and the economy shifted towards producing services rather than goods. Returning soldiers disproportionately displaced female and minority workers who had entered the industrial workforce only when the war left employers no other choice. Companies moved {{to the south and}} west, seeking <b>lower</b> <b>taxes</b> and a less costly, nonunion workforce. Many workers followed the jobs.|$|E
25|$|Jefferson's {{successful}} {{first term}} occasioned his re-nomination for president by the Republican party, with George Clinton replacing Burr {{as his running}} mate.

The Jefferson-Clinton ticket won overwhelmingly {{in the electoral college}} vote, by 162 to 14, promoting their achievement of a strong economy, <b>lower</b> <b>taxes,</b> and the Louisiana Purchase.|$|E

50|$|To {{maintain}} the progressive nature of total taxes and transfers on individuals, Singapore reduced income tax on lower-income earners, {{as well as}} instituted direct transfer payments to lower-income groups, resulting in an overall <b>lower</b> <b>tax</b> burden for most Singaporean households. These offsets included <b>lower</b> income <b>taxes,</b> <b>lower</b> property <b>taxes,</b> rebates on rental and service & conservancy charges for public housing, and additional subsidies for health, education and community services.
