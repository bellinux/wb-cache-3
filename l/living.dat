5|$|Estimates of {{accepted}} described <b>living</b> {{species of}} molluscs vary from 50,000 {{to a maximum}} of 120,000species. In 1969 David Nicol estimated the probable total number of <b>living</b> molluscs at 107,000 of which were about 12,000 fresh-water gastropods and 35,000 terrestrial. The Bivalvia would comprise about 14% of the total and the other five classes less than 2% of the <b>living</b> molluscs. In 2009, Chapman estimated the number of described <b>living</b> species at 85,000. Haszprunar in 2001 estimated about 93,000named species, which include 23% of all named marine organisms. Molluscs are second only to arthropods in numbers of <b>living</b> animal species—far behind the arthropods' 1,113,000 but well ahead of chordates' 52,000. About 200,000 <b>living</b> species in total are estimated, and 70,000 fossil species, although the total number of mollusc species ever to have existed, whether or not preserved, must be many times greater than the number alive today.|$|E
