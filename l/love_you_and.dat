25|$|Gately's bandmates flew to Majorca on 11 October 2009; Walsh was {{expected}} to join them soon after. The remaining members of Boyzone, Keith Duffy, Michael Graham, Ronan Keating and Shane Lynch, issued a joint statement: We are completely devastated {{by the loss of}} our friend and brother, Stephen. We have shared such wonderful times together over the years and were all looking forward to sharing many more. Stephen was a beautiful person in both body and spirit. He lit up our lives and those of the many friends he had all over the world. Our love and sympathy go out to Andrew and Stephen's family. We <b>love</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> will miss you forever, 'Steo'.A post-mortem and toxicology tests took place on 13 October and this examination showed that Gately died of natural causes. He {{died as a result of}} a congenital heart defect. Toxicology also confirmed the statement by Gately's partner Cowles that he had been smoking cannabis that evening.|$|E

500|$|Recording {{began in}} September 1970 at Decca Studios, West Hampstead, London. Guitarist Pye Hastings {{had written the}} bulk of {{material}} for earlier albums, {{which led to a}} backlog of songs composed {{by the rest of the}} group; consequently he only offered a single song, [...] "Love to <b>Love</b> <b>You</b> (<b>And</b> Pigs Might Fly)". Bassist Richard Sinclair had written [...] "Golf Girl", a song about his girlfriend and future wife. Both songs were written in a straightforward pop style, in contrast to some longer pieces on the album. Keyboardist David Sinclair had composed a number of different musical segments that he wanted to link together to a suite of songs. The group helped with the arranging and joining of sections, resulting in a 22-minute piece, [...] "Nine Feet Underground". The song was recorded in five separate sections and edited together by Hitchcock and engineer Dave Grinsted. Most of the work is instrumental, aside from two sections with lyrics. David Sinclair played most of the solos on the track, and indeed the entire album, on either fuzztone organ or piano.|$|E

500|$|In {{an unconstitutional}} though {{widespread}} practice during the Communist witchhunts, the U.S. State Department refused to renew Rossen's passport. This, and {{his inability to}} find work, brought Rossen, like his friend, ex-Communist Elia Kazan, back to the committee in May 1953, where he named 57 people as Communists. [...] He explained to the committee why he chose to testify: [...] "I don't think, {{after two years of}} thinking, that any one individual can indulge himself in the luxury of personal morality or pit it against what I feel today very strongly is the security and safety of this nation." [...] Stephen Rossen later shed light on his father's decision: [...] "It killed him not to work. He was torn between his desire to work and his desire not to talk, and he didn't know what to do. What I think he wanted to know was, what would I think of him if he talked? He didn't say it in that way, though. Then he explained to me the politics of it—how the studios were in on it, and there was never any chance of his working. He was under pressure, he was sick, his diabetes was bad, and he was drinking. By this time I understood that he had refused to talk before and had done his time, from my point of view. What could any kid say at that point? You say, 'I <b>love</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> I'm behind you.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{response}} was largely positive.

Pussy Riot themselves tweeted: [...] "DEAR MADONNA! We <b>love</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> you just might be changing Russia's history right now. Thank you and a thousand prayers in return!"

He wrote Fronto a letter on his birthday, claiming to love him as he loved himself, and calling on the gods to ensure that every word he learned of literature, he would learn [...] "from the lips of Fronto". His prayers for Fronto's health were more than conventional, because Fronto was frequently ill; at times, {{he seems to be}} an almost constant invalid, always suffering—about one quarter of the surviving letters deal with the man's sicknesses. Marcus asks that Fronto's pain be inflicted on himself, [...] "of my own accord with every kind of discomfort".|$|E
