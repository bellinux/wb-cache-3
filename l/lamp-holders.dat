Built in 1902 and designed Henry Miller, the Felling U.D.C surveyor, {{this is another}} ashlar and sandstone building in the Baroque style. The five piers and <b>lamp-holders</b> guarding the town hall are also Grade II listed. The Brandling Junction railway building, now an urban studies centre, has been restored and is also a Grade II listed building. At the extreme north of the town at Riverside Park, the former engine house of Tyne Main Colliery, built in 1820, is also a Grade II listed building.|$|E

60|$|This was {{the first}} time that Mr. Casaubon had spoken at any length. He {{delivered}} himself with precision, as if he had been called upon to make a public statement; and the balanced sing-song neatness of his speech, occasionally corresponded to by a movement of his head, was the more conspicuous from its contrast with good Mr. Brooke's scrappy slovenliness. Dorothea said to herself that Mr. Casaubon was the most interesting man she had ever seen, not excepting even Monsieur Liret, the Vaudois clergyman who had given conferences on the history of the Waldenses. To reconstruct a past world, doubtless with a view to the highest purposes of truth--what a work to be in any way present at, to assist in, though only as a <b>lamp-holder!</b> This elevating thought lifted her above her annoyance at being twitted with her ignorance of political economy, that never-explained science which was thrust as an extinguisher over all her lights.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "striking" [...] and [...] "spectacular" [...] {{restaurant}} section, {{added as}} part of the [...] "famous facelift" [...] of 1928, has been described as [...] "reminiscent of the Viennese Secession". [...] The three-bay exterior is framed by a two-storey gold and blue mosaic with gold lettering at the top, reading [...] and [...] The dado has gold Masonic symbols, and the lettering at the top is framed by two Stars of David; below these, there are a pair of gold figures in the form of chimera, with a griffin- or fish-style head and a curved body like that of a seahorse. [...] Below the mosaic frame, a two-storey glazed bronze screen with metal framing leads to a recessed doorway. Some of the glass is leaded with sunburst forms. Paired bronze <b>lamp-holders</b> project from the entrance. [...] At second-floor level, there is a modern three-part window. [...] Inside, much of Denman & Son's Art Deco work survives. There are moulded beams and friezes with swag motifs, integral seating and other furniture, Art Deco lighting, decorative plasterwork and an original staircase.|$|E
5000|$|As {{evidence}} of James Wood's eccentricity and religious fervour Lucy described {{the interior of}} the house he bought and had decorated in preparation for his marriage and the family he intended to raise there. In every room, painted friezes carried religious mottos such as [...] "He that giveth to the poor shall not lack", [...] "Honour they father and thy mother" [...] and [...] "The soul is not where it lives but where it loves". But what she described as [...] "the triumph of eccentricity" [...] was the drawing room. Her father had visited the Holy Land and had brought back many things with the idea of creating what she described as [...] "a holy and uplifting room". There was a continuous frieze of a painted landscape representing the journey from Jerusalem to Jericho, while from the ceiling hung antique brass <b>lamp-holders</b> such as might have hung in Solomon’s Temple. Recesses in the walls were divided by wooden arcades of the Moorish onion shape and there were many beautiful objects made of brass, as well as other rarities displayed in a glass-fronted cupboard. Lucy said: [...] "This unexpected room did not look at all like a Kardomah Café as you might think. It looked like a gentleman’s enthusiastic and satisfied near-lunacy." ...|$|E
