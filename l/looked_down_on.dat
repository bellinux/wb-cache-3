5|$|Relations {{between the}} United Kingdom and the United States were {{strained}} during the inter-war {{years and the}} majority of Britons were reluctant to accept an American as queen consort. At the time, some members of the British upper class <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> Americans with disdain and considered them socially inferior. In contrast, the American public was clearly in favour of the marriage, as was most of the American press.|$|E
5|$|As Mulder and Scully investigate, they {{discover}} a Malaysian orderly is illicitly giving the patients an herbal drug made of mushrooms he {{cultures in the}} building's basement. The drug cures their Alzheimer's, but also allows them to see the spirits {{of people who have}} died in the nursing home and channel them into existence. In this state, the spirits assault and murder the orderlies that have <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> them and treated them poorly while they were patients. When a patient overdoses on the drug, the spirits once again attack Charters, trapping her and Mulder in the bathroom, which begins flooding.|$|E

5|$|The same year, George {{married his}} first cousin, Sophia Dorothea of Celle, thereby {{securing}} additional incomes {{that would have}} been outside Salic laws. The marriage of state was arranged primarily as it ensured a healthy annual income and assisted the eventual unification of Hanover and Celle. His mother was at first against the marriage because she <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> Sophia Dorothea's mother (who was not of royal birth), and because she was concerned by Sophia Dorothea's legitimated status. She was eventually won over by the advantages inherent in the marriage.|$|E
5|$|The site abuts a major ancient intersection. Opposite lay a {{large public}} square {{fronting}} the Temple's main Hulda Gates. The Tyropoeon street itself {{was lined with}} shops and formed part of the city's Lower Market. The Royal Stoa, an exceptionally large basilica complex which served various commercial and legal functions, <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the intersection from atop the Temple platform. Although the Stoa stood on the Temple esplanade, it was constructed upon an expansion added by Herod. It was therefore evidently not considered sacred by some at the time, allowing it {{to be used for}} mundane activities. The heavy public traffic to and from this edifice accounts for the width of the stepped street, which approximates that of a modern four-lane highway.|$|E
5|$|During the withdraw, however, A Company {{ran into}} a sizable North Korean force and had {{scattered}} in the ensuing fight. Most of the company, including its commander were killed at close range. In this desperate action, Private First Class Luther H. Story, a weapons squad leader, fought so tenaciously that {{he was awarded the}} Medal of Honor. Badly wounded, Story refused to be a burden to those who might escape, and when last seen was still engaging North Korean at close range. Of those in the company, approximately ten men escaped to friendly lines. The next morning, under heavy fog, the group made its way by compass toward Yongsan. From a hill at 12:00, after the fog had lifted, the men <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the Battle of Yongsan which was then in progress. That afternoon 20 survivors of the company merged into the lines of the 72nd Tank Battalion near Yongsan. Stragglers from this position continued to stream {{in the next few days}} as well.|$|E

5|$|Andrew Johnson {{was born}} in Raleigh, North Carolina, on December 29, 1808, to Jacob Johnson (1778–1812) and Mary ("Polly") McDonough (1783–1856), a laundress. He was of English, Scottish, and Irish ancestry. He had a brother William, four years his senior, and an older sister Elizabeth, who died in childhood. Johnson's birth in a log cabin was a {{political}} asset in the mid-19th century, and he would frequently remind voters of his humble origins. Jacob Johnson was a poor man, as had been his father, William Johnson, but he became town constable of Raleigh before marrying and starting a family. He died of an apparent heart attack while ringing the town bell, shortly after rescuing three drowning men, when his son Andrew was three. Polly Johnson worked as a washerwoman and became the sole support of her family. Her occupation was then <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>on,</b> as it often took her into other homes unaccompanied. There were even rumors that Andrew, who did not resemble his brother or sister, had been fathered by another man.

Vietnam's educated class <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> Nom as inferior to Han, so they {{were not interested in}} doing the work required to turn Nom into a form of writing suitable for mass communication.

Neither the Korean nor the Japanese writing systems indicate tones, so they cannot be accurately applied to the Vietnamese language without significant modifications to their systems.|$|E

Snuka split his time between the AWA and Japan throughout 1986 and 1987. His most notable feud in the AWA during that time was with Colonel DeBeers, who portrayed a racist and <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> Snuka because of his skin color.

At the time, China's social structure, as dictated by Confucian tradition, <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> merchants, ranking them below farmers and above slaves, since they were considered citizens who only enriched themselves.|$|E
