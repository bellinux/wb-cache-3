40|$|Purpose – Labour market {{constraints}} constitute prominent {{obstacles to}} firm development {{and economic growth}} of countries located in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine the implications of firm characteristics, national locations, and sectoral associations for the perceptions of firms concerning two basic labour market constraints: <b>labour</b> <b>regulations</b> and <b>labour</b> skill shortages. Design/methodology/approach – The empirical analysis is carried out using firm-level data set sourced from the World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys database. A bivariate probit estimator is used to account for potential correlations between the errors in the two labour market constraints’ equations. The authors implement overall estimations and comparative cross-country and cross-sector analyses, and use alternative estimation models. Findings – The empirical results reveal some important implications of firm characteristics (e. g. firm size, labour compositions) for firm perceptions of <b>labour</b> <b>regulations</b> and <b>labour</b> skill shortages. They also delineate important cross-country and cross-sector variations. The authors also find significant heterogeneity in the factors’ implications for the perceptions of firms belonging to different sectors and located in different MENA countries. Originality/value – Reforms in <b>labour</b> <b>regulations</b> and investment in human capital are important governmental policy interventions for promoting firm development and economic growth in the MENA region. This paper contributes to the empirical literature by analysing the factors influencing the perceptions of firms located in the MENA region concerning <b>labour</b> <b>regulations</b> and <b>labour</b> skill shortages. It provides policy-makers with information needed in the design of labour policies that attenuate the impacts of labour market constraints and enhance the performance of firms and the long-run economic growth.

We obtain a quantitative measure of â€˜stringency of labour regulationsâ€™ by applying majority rule on three different measures used in the literature. The results show that average labour productivity increases with the increase in the ratio of permanent workers to contractual workers, unless the industries are not operating in states having rigid/pro-worker labour regulationsâ€”which implies a negative impact of contractualization on labour productivity. Besides, the results show that the rigid/pro-worker <b>labour</b> <b>regulations</b> have negative impact on employment generation; it is especially discernible in labour-intensive industries.

50|$|A {{detailed}} {{history of}} <b>labour</b> <b>regulation</b> in the 16th century would include some {{account of the}} Tudor laws against vagrancy and methods {{of dealing with the}} increase of pauperism, attributable, at least in part, to the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII., and to the confiscation of craft guild funds, which proceeded under the Lord Protector Somerset and Edward VI. It is sufficient here to point to the general recognition of the public right to compel labourers to work and thus secure control of unemployed as well as employed. The statutes of Henry VIII. and Edward VI. against vagrancy differed rather in degree of severity than in principle from legislation for similar purposes in previous and subsequent reigns.|$|E
40|$|At {{a time of}} intensifying uncertainty, {{managerial}} {{flexibility to}} adapt {{to changes in the}} economic environment is increasingly important. Different business loca-tions, it is frequently argued, offer this flexibility to differing degrees, and <b>labour</b> market <b>regulations</b> are held to be one essential factor in determining the resulting attractiveness of a country as a business location. This paper takes an options perspective in order to grasp the potential effect of <b>labour</b> market <b>regulations</b> on location decisions. The option value of an investment, it is argued, is influenced, among other factors, by <b>labour</b> market <b>regulations.</b> Depending on their prefer-ence for certain options, different investors will prefer different labour market settings.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} linking investment (capital stock) and structural policies. Using {{a panel of}} 32 OECD countries from 1985 to 2013, we show that more stringent product and <b>labour</b> market <b>regulations</b> are associated with less investment (lower capital stock). The paper also sheds light {{on the existence of}} non-linear effects of product and <b>labour</b> market <b>regulation</b> on the capital stock. Several alternative testing methods show that the negative influence of product and <b>labour</b> market <b>regulation</b> is considerably stronger at higher levels. The paper uncovers important policy interactions between product and labour market policies. Higher levels of product market regulations (covering state control, barriers to entrepreneurship and barriers to trade and investment) tend to amplify the negative relationships between product and <b>labour</b> market <b>regulations</b> and the capital stock. Equally important is the finding that {{the rule of law and}} the quality of (legal) institutions alters the overall impact of regulations on capital deepening: better institutions reduce the negative effect of more stringent product and <b>labour</b> market <b>regulations</b> on the capital stock, possibly through the reduction of uncertainty as regards the protection of property rights...|$|R

50|$|With {{unemployment}} around 16% {{and many}} {{jobs in the}} informal sector, Georgia undertook a far-reaching reform of <b>labour</b> <b>regulation.</b> The new Labour Code was adopted on 17 December 2010. The new law eases restrictions on the duration of term contracts {{and the number of}} overtime hours and discards the premium required for overtime work. It also eliminates the requirement to notify and get permission from the labour union to fire a redundant worker. The new law provides for 1 month’s severance pay at least, replacing complex rules under which required notice periods depended on seniority and the manager had to write long explanations to labor unions and the relevant ministry. In general, new regulation makes Georgian labor market much more flexible.|$|E
50|$|In {{virtually}} every {{debate on the}} various Factories Bills, opponents had thought it a nonsense to pass legislation for textile mills when {{the life of a}} mill child was much preferable to that of many other children: other industries were more tiring, more dangerous, more unhealthy, required longer working hours, involved more unpleasant working conditions, or (this being Victorian Britain) were more conducive to lax morals. This logic began to be applied in reverse once {{it became clear that the}} Ten Hours Act had had no obvious detrimental effect on the prosperity of the textile industry or on that of millworkers. Acts were passed bringing other textile trades within the scope of the Factories Act : bleaching and dyeworks (1860 - outdoor bleaching was excluded), lace work (1861), calendering (1863), finishing (1864). In 1864 the Factories Extension Act was passed: this extended the Factories Act to cover a number of occupations (mostly non-textile): potteries (both heat and exposure to lead glazes were issues), lucifer match making ('phossie jaw') percussion cap and cartridge making, paper staining and fustian cutting. In 1867 the Factories Act was extended to all establishments employing 50 or more workers by another Factories Act Extension Act. An Hours of <b>Labour</b> <b>Regulation</b> Act applied to 'workshops' (establishments employing less than 50 workers); it subjected these to requirements similar to those for 'factories' (but less onerous on a number of points e.g.: the hours within which the permitted hours might be worked were less restrictive, there was no requirement for certification of age) but was to be administered by local authorities, rather than the Factory Inspectorate.|$|E

5000|$|Like <b>labour</b> <b>regulation,</b> European {{corporate}} {{law is not}} a complete system {{and there is no}} such thing as a self-standing European corporation.

There is however, a [...] "European Company" [...] (or Societas Europaea, abbreviated to [...] "SE") created by the Statute for a European Company Regulation 2001. This sets out basic provisions on the method of registration (e.g. by merger or reincorporation of an existing company) but then states that wherever the SE has its registered office, the law of that member state supplements the rules of the Statute. The Employee Involvement Directive 2001also adds that, when an SE is incorporated, employees have the default right to retain all existing representation on the board of directors that they have, unless the negotiate by collective agreement a different or better plan than is provided for in existing member state law. Other than this, most important standards in a typical company law are left to member state law, so long as they comply with further minimum requirements in the company law directives. Duties owed by the board of directors to the company and its stakeholders, or the right to bring derivative claims to vindicate constitutional rights, are not generally regulated by EU law. Nor are rights of pre-emption to buy shares, nor rights of any party regarding claims by tort, contract or piercing the corporate veil to hold directors and shareholders accountable. However, Directives do require minimum rights on company formation, capital maintenance, accounting and audit, market regulation, board neutrality in a takeover bid, rules on mergers, and management of cross-border insolvency. The omission of minimum standards is important since the Court of Justice held in Centros that freedom of establishment requires companies operate in any member state they choose. This has been argued to risk a [...] "race to the bottom" [...] in standards, although the Court of Justice soon affirmed in Inspire Art that companies must still comply with proportionate requirements that are in the [...] "public interest".|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The World Bank’s Doing Business survey {{seeks to}} measure and compare the costs to {{business}} of various types of regulation, including <b>labour</b> <b>regulation.</b> As such {{it is an important}} driver of labour market ‘reform’ globally and in South Africa. It may also be encouraging a tendency of different systems of regulation to converge. Focussing on <b>labour</b> <b>regulation,</b> the study considers the validity of endeavours to measure <b>labour</b> <b>regulation,</b> and identifies a number of methodological problems that constrain any such endeavour. It then focuses specifically on the methodology utilised in the Doing Business survey, and its results for South Africa. It presents evidence that certain scores arrived at in the case of South Africa are incorrect, materially affecting South Africa’s ranking in terms of the survey. These errors can be attributed to shortcoming in the survey’s methodology as well as the simplistic conceptions of law reflected in the surveys. This finding does not imply endeavours to measure the costs of regulation are without value. Instead the study advocates developing different indicators to measure the impact of <b>labour</b> <b>regulation,</b> and drawing on existing data and research to arrive at more objective results.
