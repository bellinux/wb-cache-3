5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} Tonkin Gulf Incident in August 1964, the US Navy {{developed}} a training exercise to simulate firing on small, high-speed targets {{at night and}} Tillamook was assigned to participate off Subic Bay. Tillmook would tow the sled in one direction at top speed—just over 11 knots—while a destroyer steamed {{in the opposite direction}} at something close to top speed—something close to 30 knots—creating a relative closing speed of about 40 knots. On the first two nights, the destroyers illuminated the tow with their star shells, locked the turrets on the two, but did not fire. On several occasions, the star shells illuminated Tillamook. On the third night, a destroyer commenced a <b>live</b> <b>exercise,</b> but also placed the star shells over Tillamook rather than over the tow. Shortly thereafter, the crew on the Tillamook heard the destroyer radioman announced [...] "Shot, out"—it was on the way. A few second later, a salvo of AA Common shattered about 50-100 yards short of Tillamook—and then [...] "Shot, out" [...] again—before the crew could react, a second salvo was on the way that landed about 50-100 yards long. Although the salvos missed, shrapnel hit the side of Tillmook, and the crew collected them in a box and gave them to the destroyer as a present the following day while delivering the mail to the fleet.|$|E

Deane opened new studios {{on the main}} quad of the West Campus and in the new Bryan Center, in addition to renovating the Old Chemistry space. A seven-day-a-week nightly news show was initiated, with Bill Love and Doug Davis as anchors. Gavin Sasson was the weatherman, who developed quite a campus following. A daily <b>live</b> <b>exercise</b> program was also debuted, known as Tiffanys Hour. Mollie Fitzgeralds Cable Cooking was also developed, and included segments filmed in President Terry Sanfords home. Alice Babcock and Rachel Frankle pioneered the Arts Expo series, in which they covered Duke and Durham, including an interview with Kenneth Noland. Robert Levitans Late Night was known throughout the campus, and included a studio audience, for which tickets were required. Deane also did a monthly interview program, with Sanford, Chancellor Brody, Dean Wasolick, Dean Griffiths, football coach Red Wilson, basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski and others as guests. A 3D film festival {{was the first to}} be on a cable station in the US at the time, with glasses provided in every Chronicle issue. With all of the added hours, Duke basketball and football continued to be covered, with live broadcasts of soccer and lacrosse brought to the stations lineup. Many days had as much as twelve hours of original programming, with a potential audience of nearly 40,000, between the University students, faculty, administrators and the entire hospital complex.|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} After Action Review (AAR) {{is essential}} {{to get the most}} out of a <b>live</b> <b>exercise</b> or training simulation. An effective AAR requires an overall picture of all the actions and events that took place during the exercise. Compiling such an overall picture is often a complicated task, because the different participants all perform their own data logging, resulting in many separate data logs, often in different data formats. TNO’s Generic Reconstruction And Computing Environment (GRACE) has been developed for quickly compiling the overall picture of a <b>live</b> <b>exercise</b> or training simulation. GRACE can process various data formats and provides various tools for the analysis, integration, and visualization of logged data, making it possible to create a complete reconstruction of an exercise. Its flexible architecture allows the addition of new data formats or new analysis tools. GRACE has been proven successful during several live firings. This paper describes the innovative architecture and ideas behind GRACE. We will discuss how GRACE handles, interprets and combines data, how the framework was designed to be generic and flexible for extensions, and we will give examples of our experiences with the tool...|$|E

40|$|The {{option to}} {{automatically}} model {{the behavior of}} different actors during <b>live</b> <b>exercise</b> training would increase {{the value of the}} after-action-review (AAR) process. If a simulated model of the actors is available right after the <b>live</b> <b>exercise</b> training, the evaluation of their behavior would be more timely and alternative actions could also be evaluated at the same time. The CxBR Diffusion Engine merges technologies to establish a tool for automatic, on-line behavior modeling. Context Based Reasoning (CxBR) is a proven methodology to build simulated agents with human behavior. Genetic Programming (GP) provides the CxBR framework with learning capabilities to automatically create simulated agents with human behavior. The final piece in the CxBR Diffusion Engine is to provide an efficient, flexible, scaleable and mobile platform to evolve the agents’ behavior. This platform is the newly developed massively parallel architecture for distributed GP. The massively parallel architecture has the potential to execute the GP linear machine code representation at a rate of up to 50, 000 generations per second. Implemented in an FPGA, this architecture is highly portable and applicable to mobile, on-line applications. This paper will present a theory on how the CxBR + GP can evolve simulated agents with human behavior by observation in a massively parallel architecture. These pieces will introduce all the necessary elements to build the CxBR Diffusion Engine that could model human behavior to enable individual AAR of trainees in the training field...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} a dynamic data-driven mixed reality en-vironment to complement a full-scale bio-terror preparedness exercise. The environment {{consists of a}} simulation of the virtual geographic loca-tions involved in the exercise scenario, along with an artificially intelli-gent agent-based population. The crisis scenario, like the epidemiology of a disease or the plume of a chemical spill or radiological explosion, is then simulated in the virtual environment. The public health impact, the economic impact and the public approval rating impact is then cal-culated based on {{the sequence of events}} defined in the scenario, and the actions and decisions made during the full-scale exercise. The decisions made in the <b>live</b> <b>exercise</b> influence the outcome of the simulation, and the outcomes of the simulation influence the decisions being made during the exercise. The mixed reality environment provides the long-term and large-scale impact of the decisions made during the full-scale exercise. ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: By {{exploiting}} {{video games}} technology, serious games strive to deliver affordable, accessible and usable interactive virtual worlds, supporting applications in training, education, marketing and design. The {{aim of the}} present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of such a serious game in the teaching of major incident triage by comparing it with traditional training methods. Design: Pragmatic controlled trial. Method: During Major Incident Medical Management and Support Courses, 91 learners were randomly distributed into one of two training groups: 44 participants practiced triage sieve protocol using a card-sort exercise, whilst the remaining 47 participants used a serious game. Following the training sessions, each participant undertook an evaluation exercise, whereby they were required to triage eight casualties in a simulated <b>live</b> <b>exercise.</b> Performance was assessed in terms of tagging accuracy (assigning the correct triage tag to the casualty), step accuracy (following correct procedure) and time taken to triage all casualties. Additionally, the usability of both the card-sort exercise and video game were measured using a questionnaire. Results: Tagging accuracy by participants who underwent the serious game training was significantly higher than those who undertook the card-sort exercise [Chi 2 = 13. 126, p= 0. 02]. Step accuracy was also higher in the serious game group but only for the numbers of participants that followed correct procedure when triaging all eight casualties [Chi 2 = 5. 45, p= 0. 0196]. There was no significant difference in time to triage all casualties (card-sort = 435 ± 74. s vs video game = 456 ± 62. s, p= 0. 155).

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This thesis describes two integer programming models that are developed to support movement planners in optimally routing military units through a road network with minimal delays. The formulations {{are based on}} a multicommodity time-expanded network flow problem. The first model (called model close column) is designed for use when all vehicles of a military unit are required to move together over one route. The second model (called model separate column) allows a military unit to be split into groups of vehicles which may use different routes and start at irregular times. Variants of the models allow all units to move at just one speed, or allow units to move at one of two speeds, fast or slow. Both models are designed with the German Army in mind, but could be used with minor modifications by other Armies. The models are implemented via the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). A hypothetical peacetime scenario based upon completion of a German brigade <b>live</b> <b>exercise</b> is used to test both models. In the test data, five military units are specified such that their movements inside an area of 24 by 12 km would conflict without careful planning. Depending on the model and whether movements are planned with different speeds, these five units are routed with solution times from 14 sec to 131 sec on a 486 / 33 MHz personal computer with the ZOOM solver. The advantage of movements at different speeds is clearly demonstrated. Evaluation of all results shows that they are accurate and that planners can be effectively supported by the models.

40|$|The {{recently}} started Mediterranean ATM <b>Live</b> <b>Exercise</b> (MedALE) project among the SESAR Integrated RPAS Demonstration Activities, has the goal to provide {{to a wide}} spectrum of European Stakeholders indications and recommendations about the validity and limits of the existing RPAS assets, practices and operational procedure. In addition this project will provide an interesting contribution identifying the future necessary improvements or modifications to comply with the new ATM concepts that SESAR Programme is realizing. The MedALE demonstration programme adopted an incremental and complementary series of steps designed to demonstrate how RPAS may be integrated into non-segregated airspace. A combined approach has been adopted taking into account different levels of complexity and realism: Virtual and Constructive Real Time Simulation (RTS) and Live Trial (LT). RTS have been performed during November 2014 while LT activities are planned in May 2015. This paper is focused on the Real Time simulation exercise that investigated the cooperation between ATC Controllers and RPAS Pilots in non-segregated airspace. In order to represent a real environment, a complex networked infrastructure composed by an integration of several remote simulation platforms was set up. In particular, ENAV ATC simulation system (hosted by NATO M&S CoE) and three RPAS simulator known as SKY-Y Full Mission Simulator (Male UAV), FALCO (Tactical UAV) and C-FLY (Light UAV), provided by Alenia Aermacchi, Selex and Nimbus respectively were linked ad hoc. The Operational Environment selected for the simulation exercise was the Decimomannu (LIED) airport located in Sardinia Island. During simulation campaign three type of scenarios have been considered. (1) Reference Scenario - reproducing the situation without the proposed solution. It means that the scenario didn’t include the implementation of the RPAS. (2) Solution Scenario - represented by Reference Scenario with the introduction of three different types (with different performances) RPAS. This scenario was analyzed in both Line Of Sight (LOS) and Beyond Radio Line Of Sight (BRLOS) configurations. BRLOS scenario use RAPTOR simulation platform developed by Thales Alenia Space Italia, a SATCOM simulator in the loop emulating BRLOS C 2 data link communications. (3) Non nominal Scenario - represented by Solution Scenario with the implementation of unusual events represented by RPAS loss of power, General Aviation Traffic (GAT) unusual situations and Loss of R/T Voice communication between RPAS Pilot and ATCO. Making the comparison among these different scenarios interesting results have been obtained in terms of Safety and Human Performance Key Performance Area (KPA) with analysis of several indicators (Workload; Situational Awareness, Usability, Teamwork, Change of practices and procedure). The results collected from validation activities for both ATCOs and RPAS Pilots side, provided important feedback about technologies that support these Stakeholders and gave important elements on integration of RPAS traffic in a real ATM environment...|$|E
40|$|Self-presentation is {{the process}} by which {{individuals}} attempt to monitor and control how others perceive and evaluate them (Leary, 1992; Leary & Kowalski, 1990). Self-presentational concerns have been shown to influence a number of exercise-related behaviours, cognitions, and affective responses to exercise (e. g., social anxiety). Social anxiety occurs when an individual wants to create a specific impression on others, but is unsure (s) he will be successful (Leary & Kowalski, 1995). Social physique anxiety (SPA) is a specific form of social anxiety related the evaluation of one's body (Hart, Leary, & Rejeski, 1989). Both social anxiety and SPA may act as deterrents to exercise (Lantz, Hardy, & Ainsworth, 1997; Leary, 1992), so it is important to examine factors that may influence social anxiety and SPA; one such factor is self-presentational efficacy (SPE). SPE is one's confidence in successfully making desired impressions on others (Leary & Atherton, 1986) and has been associated with social anxiety and SPA (Leary & Kowalski, 1995; Gammage, Martin Ginis, & Hall, 2004). Several aspects of the exercise environment, such as the presence of mirrors, clothing, and the exercise leader or other participant characteristics, may be manipulated to influence self-presentational concerns (e. g., Gammage, Martin Ginis et aI., 2004; Martin & Fox, 2001; Martin Ginis, Prapavessis, & Haase, 2005). Given that the exercise leader has been {{recognized as one of the}} most important influences in the group exercise context (Franklin, 1988), it is important to further examine how the leader may impact self-presentational concerns. The present study examined the impact of the exercise leader's gender and physique salience (i. e., the extent to which the body was emphasized) on SPE, state social anxiety (SSA), and state social physique anxiety (SPA-S) of women in a <b>live</b> <b>exercise</b> class. Eighty-seven college-aged female non- or infrequent exercisers (i. e., exercised 2 or fewer times per week) participated in a group exercise class led by one of four leaders: a female whose physique was salient; a female whose physique was non-salient; a male whose physique was salient; or a male whose physique was non-salient. Participants completed measures of SPE, SSA, and SPA-S prior to and following completion of a 30 - minute group exercise class. In addition, a measure of social comparison to the exercise leader and other participants with respect to attractiveness, skill, and fitness was completed by participants following the exercise class. A MANOV A was conducted to examine differences between groups on postexercise variables. Results indicated that there were no significant differences between groups on measures ofSPE, SSA, or SPA-S (allp's >. 05). However, when all participants were collapsed into one group, a MANOV A showed a significant time effect (F(3, 81) = 19. 45,p <. 05, 1 ') 2 =. 419). Follow-up ANOVAs indicated that post-exercise SPE increased significantly, while SSA and SPA-S decreased significantly (SPE: F(I, 83) = 30. 87,p <. 001, 1 ') 2 =. 27; SSA: F(I, 83) = 11. 09,p <. 001, 1 ') 2 =. 12; SPA-S: F (1, 83) = 42. 79,p <. 001, 1 ') 2 =. 34). Further, results of a MANOVA revealed that participants who believed they were less fit than other group members (i. e., made negative social comparisons) reported significantly more post-exercise SSA and SP A-S than those who believed they were more fit than the other participants (i. e., made positive comparisons; SSA: F(2, 84) = 3. 46, p <. 05, 1 ') 2 =. 08; SPA-S: F(2, 84) = 5. 69, p <. 05, 1 ') 2 =. 12). These results may indicate that successfully completing an exercise class may serve as a source of SPE and lead to reduced social anxiety and SPA-S in this population. Alternatively, characteristics of the exercise leader may be less important than characteristics of the other participants. These results also suggest that the types of social comparisons made may influence self-presentational concerns in this sample. Future research should examine how the type of social comparison (i. e., negative or positive) made to the other group members may either generate or reduce anxiety. Also, factors that contribute to the types of social comparisons made with other exercisers should be examined. Implications for practice and research are discussed...|$|E
