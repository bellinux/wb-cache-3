40|$|This work {{concentrates}} on automatic procedures for simplifying chemical models for realistic fuels using skeletal mechanism construction and Quasi Steady-State Approximation (QSSA) applied to detailed reaction mechanisms. To automate {{the selection of}} species for removal or approximation, different indices for species ranking have thus been proposed. Reaction flow rates are combined with sensitivity information for targeting a certain quantity, and used to determine a <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>redundance</b> for automatic skeletal mechanism construction by exclusion of redundant species. For QSSA reduction, a measure of species lifetime {{can be used for}} species ranking as-is, weighted by concentrations or molecular transport timescales, and/or combined with species sensitivity. Maximum values of the indices are accumulated over ranges of parameters, (e. g. fuel-air ratio and octane number), and species with low accumulated index values are selected for removal or steady-state approximation. In the case of QSSA, a model with a certain degree of reduction is automatically implemented as FORTRAN code by setting a certain index limit. The code calculates source terms of explicitly handled species from reaction rates and the steady-state concentrations by internal iteration. Homogeneous-reactor and one-dimensional laminar-flame models were used as test cases. A staged combustor fuelled by ethylene with monomethylamine addition is modelled by two homogeneous reactors in sequence, i. e. a PSR (Perfectly Stirred Reactor) followed by a PFR (Plug Flow Reactor). A modified PFR model was applied for simulation of a Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine fuelled with four-component natural gas, whereas a two-zone model was required for a knocking Spark Ignition (SI) engine powered by Primary Reference Fuel (PRF). Finally, a laminar one-dimensional model was used to simulate premixed flames burning methane and an aeroturbine kerosene surrogate consisting of n-decane and toluene. In general, detailed calculations of temperature, pressure, concentration and flame velocity show excellent agreement with measurements. Skeletal mechanisms for PRF were constructed for the SI engine case, reproducing autoignition well on removal of reactions pertaining to 15 % of the species. QSSA reduction was tested on the staged combustor and the engines, using pure and weighted lifetime indices. Monitoring NO concentrations in the staged combustor and ignition timing in the engines, good reproduction is possible while approximating about 70 % of the species. However, some species have to be manually retained for accuracy and numerical stability. For improved ranking, sensitivity was added to the index applied to the premixed flames, in addition to necessary molecular transport information. The maximum atomic mass fraction occupied by a certain molecular species was also constrained to limit the mass and energy deficiency caused by QSSA. For methane, the laminar flame velocities as well as concentration profiles are well predicted by the most strongly reduced mechanism with five global reaction steps. For the kerosene surrogate mechanism, QSSA involving 50 % of the species was successfully attempted...|$|E

40|$|The {{requests}} on {{non-destructive testing}} methots are constantly growing because of {{efficient use of}} material properties.

This dissertation formalizes the basic results obtained by Golay and develops new concepts and techniques for examining the characteristics of these special binary codes. This work has developed new understanding of the structure and methods for the decomposition of complementary sequences. Complementary sequences have the property of an infinite correlation peak to ambiguity ratio when detected with a matched filter. These binary sequences should find much application as pseudo- random noise modulation signals for both radar and communications systems. A discussion {{of the need for}} such sequences is included in the introduction and is followed by a state of the art description. An operations group on the sequences is formulated and the proofs of several theorems concerning the operations group are given in a rigorous manner. One reason for developing the operations group is the application to elimination <b>of</b> <b>redundance</b> in the computer search for new codes. Several invariant properties of complementary codes are proved through the use of the Hamming distance concept. Many more invariant properties of the sequences are demonstrated through the introduction of a Hamming vector. The concept of a Hamming vector is extremely useful as a complementary code decomposition tool. A large number of theorems are proved to enhance its use in this field. Several computer searches for complementary sequences are described and the actual computer programs for the CDC 1604 are included in the Appendix. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|This work {{introduces}} the Universal Science of Complexity. It emerges {{together with the}} paradigm <b>of</b> the dynamic <b>redundance,</b> or fundamental multivaluedness of dynamical functions, based on the plurality of incompatible, but equally real, solutions to a problem which naturally appear in the formal description of a generic dynamical behaviour, if one tries to avoid, in a universally applicable fashion, the simplification of the ordinary perturbative reduction to an effectively one-dimensional, 'separable' problem. The discovered dynamic multivaluedness directly leads to the new, universal concept of dynamic complexity and its naturally forming hierarchical structure. The lowest <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> the universal hierarchy of complexity give the complete causal wave mechanics that {{can be described as}} the unreduced version of the double solution proposed by Louis de Broglie and amplified here with the idea of the intrinsic dynamical chaos realising the dynamic redundance at the lowest <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> being. This complete wave mechanics emerges in the intrinsic unity with the causal, physically realistic extensions of 'special and general relativity', 'quantum gravity', 'field theory', 'particle physics', and cosmology. Formal analysis of complex behaviour of the arbitrary dynamical system leads to the single universal equation in its two related versions, local and nonlocal, represented respectively by the generalised Hamilton-Jacobi-Lagrange and Schroedinger equations. They describe any really existing behaviour and are reduced to the extended, complex-dynamical (explicitly multivalued) versions of the corresponding equations for each particular system (<b>level</b> <b>of</b> complexity).

40|$|ABSTRACT. The new, complex-dynamical {{mechanism}} of the universal gravitation naturally incorporating dynamical quantization, wave-particle duality, and relativity of physically emerging space and time (quant-ph/ 9902015, 16) provides the realistic meaning and fundamentally substantiated modification of the Planckian units of mass, length, and time approaching them closely to the extreme characteristic values observed for already discovered elementary particles. This result suggests the important change of the whole strategy of practical research in high-energy/particle physics, decisively displacing it towards the already attained energy scales and permitting one to exclude the existence of elementary objects in the inexplicably large interval separating the known, practically quite sufficient set of elementary species and the conventional, mechanistically exaggerated values of the Planckian units. This conclusion {{is supported by the}} causally complete (physically realistic and mathematically consistent) picture <b>of</b> the fundamental <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> reality derived, without artificial introduction of any structure or ‘principle’, from the unreduced analysis of the (generic) interaction process between two primal, physically real, but a priori structureless entities, the electromagnetic and gravitational protofields.

40|$|Abstract. The cluster {{variation}} {{method has}} been developed into a general theoretical framework for treating short-range correlations in many-body systems after it was first proposed by Kikuchi in 1951. On the numerical side, a message-passing approach called generalized belief propagation (GBP) was proposed by Yedidia, Freeman and Weiss {{about a decade ago}} as a way of computing the minimal value of the cluster variational free energy and the marginal distributions of clusters of variables. However the GBP equations are often redundant, and it is quite a non-trivial task to make the GBP iteration converges to a fixed point. These drawbacks hinder the application of the GBP approach to finite-dimensional frustrated and disordered systems. In this work we report an alternative and simple derivation of the GBP equations starting from the partition function expression. Based on this derivation we propose a natural and systematic way <b>of</b> removing the <b>redundance</b> <b>of</b> the GBP equations. We apply the simplified generalized belief propagation (SGBP) equations to the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising model and Edwards-Anderson spin glass model. The numerical results confirm that the SGBP message-passing approach is able to achieve satisfactory performance on these model systems. We also suggest that a subset of the SGBP equations can be neglected in the numerical iteration process without affecting the final results. 1...|$|R

We have previously demonstrated the potential predictive value of retinoic acid receptors (RARs) (Lefranc et al. J. Neurosurg. 2003; 98; 145 - 153). METHODS AND RESULTS: Computer-assisted microscopy was used to determine quantitatively the immunohistochemical <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> expression of the alpha, beta and gamma RAR subtypes and cathepsins B, D and K.
