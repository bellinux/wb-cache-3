The blue whiting is the most {{important}} demersal species caught by the Spanish trawler fleet in the southern Bay of Biscay. <b>Lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> dogfish are not a commercial by-catch, and are discarded immediately after sorting.

The length range of blue whiting found in <b>lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> dogfish stomachs was similar to the length range discarded by the fishery. Blue whiting account for 20 % of the stomach volume in <b>lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> dogfish 30 – 50 cm long. From the state of digestion of blue whiting prey, and the comparative analysis of the size distributions of blue whiting in <b>lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> dogfish stomachs and in the fishery, it appears that many of these blue whiting are discards, consumed when already dead or damaged.

50|$|This {{medium-sized}} eagle is {{very similar}} in general appearance to its closest relative the <b>lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> eagle, which shares part of its range. Head and wing coverts are very dark brown and contrast with the generally medium brown plumage; the <b>lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> eagle has a paler head and wing coverts. The head is small for an eagle. The similarities of the greater <b>spotted</b> to the <b>lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> often results in misidentification as being that species. This is further complicated by occasional hybrids between the two species.|$|R

50|$|Populations of <b>lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> {{woodpeckers}} {{are mostly}} resident, {{but can be}} nomadic to some degree. Annual fluctuations in population numbers are common. The winter temperatures may have a direct effect on winter survival of <b>lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> woodpeckers by heat loss, whereas weather conditions during spring have an indirect effect on breeding performance by affecting food sources. In 2017, the UK population of <b>lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> woodpeckers {{was reported to have}} almost halved since 2009, to around 2,000. The British Ornithology Trust blamed modern habits of removing dead trees quickly from parks and woodland, depriving the birds of the decaying wood which is their favoured nesting habitat.|$|R

The estimated population size is about two thousands of individuals, and the individuals frequently migrate between habitat patches. The optimal habitat structure is characterized by grassy pasture steppe with occurrence of larval host plant and abundant nectar plants for adults. The most frequent male behaviour is searching for females, while the females spend most time by nectaring. Caterpillars were found on two species of family Scrophulariaceae...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT To date, {{most of the}} <b>Lesser</b> <b>Spotted</b> Eagles Aquila pomarina that we have {{tracked by}} {{satellite}} telemetry migrated in autumn along a direct route from Israel to Africa, via Suez (Egypt). In both 1997 and 1998, however, one adult female was tracked to {{the southern tip of}} the Sinai Peninsula, and from there flew north again to Suez. Only one other adult eagle is known to have flown south over the Sinai Peninsula, but from there crossed the Gulf of Suez. The possible reasons for this behaviour, involving a 500 -km detour and a flight of about three and a half days, are discussed. Satellite-tracked <b>Lesser</b> <b>Spotted</b> Eagl...|$|R
