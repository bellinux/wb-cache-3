The former {{approaches}} to the Darlington's Bridge, which itself was dismantled by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission in 1954, became Route 163 in New Jersey and State Route 1039 in Pennsylvania. The US 611 freeway was designated I-80 by 1960, and US 611 was moved back to its old all-Pennsylvania alignment by 1972, <b>leaving</b> <b>US</b> 46 to end at I-80 and Route 94.|$|E

The exceptions were the Morgan Iron Works, and the Etna Iron Works of John Roach.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} {{in what ways}} silica is {{important}} in the nutrition of animals. This field of research is challenging because silica is ubiquitous and in most circumstances dissolves in trace quantities only. All the same it certainly does occur in the living body, <b>leaving</b> <b>us</b> with the problem {{that it is hard to}} create proper silica-free controls for purposes of research. This makes it difficult to be sure when the silica present has had operative beneficial effects, and when its presence is coincidental, or even harmful. The current consensus is that it certainly seems important in the growth, strength, and management of many connective tissues. This is true not only for hard connective tissues such as bone and tooth but possibly in the biochemistry of the subcellular enzyme-containing structures as well.|$|E

Within this 432,000 year period, there is a period of 10,000 years that will be a golden age. That golden age is being described below by Lord Sri Krishna. Predicted in Brahma-vaivarta Purana 4.129. The fourth part of the Brahma-vaivarta is called Kṛṣṇa-janma-khanda. Chapter 129 is called Golokarohanam, because it describes how Krishna returns to His abode. This specific dialogue is between Lord Krishna and Mother Ganga. Verse 49 is a question by Ganga, verses 50–60 are Lord Sri Krishna's answer.|$|E

500|$|IGN's Eric Goldman {{rated the}} episode 8.5/10. He commented that in {{resetting}} {{the events of}} [...] "Sectionals", it [...] "felt a bit rushed", but concluded: [...] "Glee continues to work because it has its cake and eats it too. It's an over the top, overly cheerful musical – but also a biting comedy that always winks at the audience and acknowledges how cheesy musical theater can be, even while also proving how fun it is." [...] The Daily News David Hinckley shared Goldman's concerns about resetting the characters, and while he believed that doing so was the right long-term move, he commented that: [...] "the immediate effect {{is to make the}} episode feel a little jerky."

In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, this portion of pre-1927 Route 14 became the southernmost part of Route 4, a route that was to run from Cape May north to the George Washington Bridge. By the 1940s, US 9 was {{extended}} south from Absecon to Cape May, running concurrent with Route 4. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, which eliminated long concurrencies between U.S. and state routes, the Route 4 designation was dropped along this portion of road, <b>leaving</b> <b>US</b> 9 as the sole designation. In 1972, US 9 was relocated from its southern terminus in Cape May to head west to its new southern terminus at the Cape May – Lewes Ferry terminal in North Cape May, with the former route into Cape May becoming Route 109.|$|E

500|$|Overall, [...] "House's Head" [...] {{was very}} well {{received}} by critics. [...] Sara Morrison, from Television Without Pity, called the moment that House gets back his memory [...] "the best ten minutes of television you might ever see". She was also pleased with the hypnotism scene, because it gave Chase [...] "something to do". Morrison graded the episode with an A+. Michelle Romero, of Entertainment Weekly, said that she can watch [...] "House's Head" [...] twice and get as much out of the second viewing as the first. TV Guides Gina Dinunno stated: [...] "It's everything I imagined: brilliant, snarky, confusing; even dirty! They did an amazing job at <b>leaving</b> <b>us</b> with the cliffhanger of all cliffhangers as we {{wait to see what}} will happen to Amber". Alan Sepinwall, from The Star-Ledger, compared the episode to the House season two finale [...] "No Reason". He, however, also said that the episode had [...] "several issues", mainly the hints towards [...] "the answer" [...] being Amber. On this, Sepinwall commented [...] "House is, at heart, a mystery, and when the show telegraphs the solution, it isn't half as entertaining".|$|E

Ashleigh Kittle of Allmusic gave it 3 out of 5 stars, comparing the album's overall sound to that of Chapman, Caedmon's Call, and Phillips, Craig & Dean. Andy Argyrakis of CCM Magazine gave the album a B grade, praising the album as a [...] "promising freshman effort" [...] but critiquing its [...] "tendency to occasionally reflect its primary muse a bit too liberally". Belinda S. Ayers of Christian Broadcasting Network praised the album's lyrics and sound. Steve Best of Cross Rhythms gave Casting Crowns ten out of ten squares, saying, [...] "The passion of lead vocalist and youth pastor Hall jumps out of each set of lyrics, while Chapman's distinctive production touch...makes this a must listen album". While praising the album's overall production and lyrical content, Breimeier said the album [...] "too readily recalls the work of its producers, <b>leaving</b> <b>us</b> to wonder {{how much of it is}} really Casting Crowns" [...] – he gave the album 3.5 out of 5 stars.

[...] Writing for MTV UK, Joanne Dorken concluded that the song was [...] "stonking and dramatic" [...] but also [...] "single-worthy." [...] Dorken added: [...] "Knowles shows off that big voice of hers, <b>leaving</b> <b>us</b> wanting more from the lady herself." [...] While reviewing 4, Gary Graff of Billboard magazine noted that several songs on the album, including [...] "Start Over", were talking about [...] "the gray areas in between". Erika Ramirez of the same magazine said: [...] "Again honest {{when it comes to}} love, Bey' won't surrender till she and beau 'give love another life.' Bey's roar matches the song's fight." [...] Ben Cardew of Music Week stated that [...] "Start Over" [...] was the first indication that Knowles might have picked [...] "some leftfield influences during those nine months off", making reference to the way the song starts, as he wrote, [...] "with what sounds like – but most probably isn't – distorted pan pipes before kicking into a massive R number." ...|$|E

[...] Entertainment Weekly journalist Abby West noted that she loved {{the fact that it}} [...] "was a bullying episode that snuck up on us". Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal opined that [...] "Mash Off" [...] {{was one of the best}} installments of Glee, and cited the episode's storylines as highlights: [...] "The mash-up episodes every season can be hit or miss, but this year was perfected to the nth degree." [...] Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times wrote that there was plenty of [...] "airy fun to be found" [...] in [...] "Mash Off", but added that [...] "underneath all the silly fake mustaches and snappy quotes about root-beer fountains and robot teachers beat a very dark baboon heart.
