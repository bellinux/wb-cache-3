5|$|River otters {{typically}} breed from December to April. Copulation <b>lasts</b> from 16–73 {{minutes and}} may occur in water or on land. During the breeding, the male grabs the female {{by the neck}} with his teeth. Copulation is vigorous, and is interrupted by periods of rest. Females may caterwaul during or shortly after mating. Female estrus <b>lasts</b> about a month per year, and true gestation <b>lasts</b> 61–63 days. Because the otters delay implantation for at least eight months, the interval between copulation and parturition can reach 10–12 months. Delayed implantation distinguishes the species from the European otter, which lacks this feature. Young are born between February and April, and parturition <b>lasts</b> three to eight hours.|$|E
