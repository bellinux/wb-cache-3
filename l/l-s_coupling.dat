40|$|We {{present an}} {{experimental}} and theoretical lattice-dynamical study of InN at high hydrostatic pressures. We perform Raman scattering measurements on five InN epilayers, with different residual strain and free electron concentrations. The experimental results are analyzed {{in terms of}} ab initio lattice-dynamical calculations on both wurtzite InN (w-InN) and rocksalt InN (rs-InN) {{as a function of}} pressure. Experimental and theoretical pressure coefficients of the optical modes in w-InN are compared, and the role of residual strain on the measured pressure coefficients is analyzed. In the case of the LO band, we analyze and discuss its pressure behavior considering the double-resonance mechanism responsible for the selective excitation of LO phonons with large wave vectors in w-InN. The pressure behavior of the <b>L-</b> <b>coupled</b> mode observed in a heavily doped n-type sample allows us to estimate the pressure dependence of the electron effective mass in w-InN. The results thus obtained are in good agreement with k·p theory. The wurtzite-to-rocksalt phase transition on the upstroke cycle and the rocksalt-to-wurtzite backtransition on the downstroke cycle are investigated, and the Raman spectra of both phases are interpreted in terms of DFT lattice-dynamical calculations. © 2013 American Physical Society.

40|$|We {{consider}} the possibility that R-parity violating interactions of particles from second and third matter generations have large (up to 1) coupling constants, Λ. Such couplings have a number of phenomenological consequences: renormalization of b-τ mass ratio, generation of ν_τ mass in MeV region, etc. In Grand Unified models, where B- and L-violating couplings appear simultaneously, the proton decay can be forbidden in virtue of hierarchical flavour structure of Λ. However, due to Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing, this decay is induced already in one-loop. Present experimental data give the upper bound Λ 3 · 10 ^- 9 (or |λ' λ"| 5 · 10 ^- 17, on the product of the <b>L-</b> and B-violating <b>coupling</b> constants, in more general context).

40|$|Hollow fiber {{supported}} {{liquid membrane}} (HFSLM) extraction often suffers from matrix effects in extracting weak organic acids in environmental waters, but {{the reasons for}} which are unclear. This work systematically studied the influence of dissolved carbon dioxide and carbonate on the HFSLM extraction of analytes in environmental waters, by using triclosan and its two typical degradation products, 2, 4 -dichlorophenol and 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol, as model compounds. HFSLM was conducted by immersing a HFSLM extraction device into a 200 mL water sample modified with 0. 01 M HCl and 10 % (m/v) NaCl, and shaking at 250 rpm for 90 min. The extraction device was prepared by immobilizing dihexyl ether on the polypropylene hollow fiber membrane wall (60 cm length, 50 mm wall thickness, 280 mm inner diameter), filling the fiber lumen with 0. 4 M NaOH as acceptor, and closing the two ends of the fiber with aluminum foil. It was demonstrated that the dissolved carbon dioxide and carbonate present in environmental samples reduces the acceptor pH and thus the recovery of target analytes, and purging the acidified sample with similar to 50 mL min(- 1) N- 2 for 15 min is a very efficient approach to eliminate this matrix effect. With this purging pretreatment, the recoveries of the analytes in environmental samples increased substantially from below 40 % to between 63 % and 121 %. For the three analytes, the proposed HFSLM method provided enrichment factors {{in the range of}} 1090 - 1322, and detection limits in the range of 0. 1 - 0. 2 mu g <b>L-</b> 1 by <b>coupling</b> with an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry system...|$|R
40|$|En climat méditerranéen, les {{ressources}} en eau des bassins sédimentaires sont rares. Pour limiter les écoulement de surface et recharger les nappes souterraines, des lacs collinaires ont été construits sous une pluviométrie annuelle comprise entre 250 et 500 mm. Des échantillons d'eau ont été prélevés dans le bassin versant d'El Gouazine, situé en Tunisie centrale, pour mieux expliciter le fonctionnement hydrochimique et la recharge de la nappe phréatique d'un lac collinaire très filtrant. Les eaux ont été échantillonnées à deux périodes distinctes (retenue presque asséchée et retenue pleine), {{en amont}} de la retenue dans le bassin versant et en aval dans l'aquifère alluvial. Trois faciès chimiques (bicarbonaté calcique, chloruré sodique et sulfaté calcique) caractérisent les eaux de nappe, l'eau de la retenue étant sulfatée calcique. La roche-mère et la nappe phréatique sont chimiquement très dépendantes. Les isotopes stables de l'eau montre que la nappe amont est peu profonde et d'origine météorique. L'eau de la retenue se mélange avec les eaux souterraines en conservant un caractère météorique en période d'écoulement et en acquérant un caractère évaporé en période d'assèchement. La nappe alluviale aval est alimentée par les eaux mélangées de la retenue. L'altération d'un affleurement gréseux forme un aquifère en rive gauche du lac expliquant en partie les pertes par infiltration. Les principaux processus géochimiques, qui se produisent au cours de l'écoulement de la nappe dans les formations superficielles, permettent une compréhension partielle du fonctionnement hydrochimique de la retenue et de son bassin versant. In a Mediterranean climate, water resources are scarce in sedimentary basins. In Tunisia, {{as in other}} semiarid countries, the revival of traditional floodwater harvesting, such as hill reservoirs, can provide water resources {{for the development of}} agriculture and agroforestry as well as reduce the use of other valuable water resources such as groundwater. Since the early 1990 s, more than 600 hill reservoirs were built within the 250 - 500 mm range of mean annual rainfall. Most of them can limit water loss by runoff and enhance groundwater recharge. The El Gouazine reservoir in Central Tunisia was chosen within the European Union sponsored project Hydromed (1997 - 2001) because its groundwater balance is highly negative, ranging annually from - 25, 408 m 3 in 1999 - 2000 (Tunisian hydrological year, conventionally starting in September and ending in August) to - 273, 435 m 3 in 1995 - 1996, thus suggesting an important water loss by infiltration. The goal of the present paper consists in studying the hydrochemical behaviour of the watershed to improve the understanding of alluvial groundwater recharge below the hill reservoir. Water sampling was carried out in May 1998 when the reservoir was almost empty (14 samples) and in March 1999 when it was full (21 samples). Surface waters were collected within the open water surface of the reservoir, in a small upstream pond created during road construction, in a temporary affluent river, in a dam seepage and in the downstream riverbed. Underground water samples were collected from three well locations located downstream from the hill reservoir, from 10 upstream well locations and from two downstream pit locations. All the samples were immediately filtered on site. Dissolved oxygen content, temperature, pH, electrical conductivity at 25 °C (EC) and alkalinity were measured in the field before filtration. The concentrations of major cations (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Na+ and K+) and anions (Cl-, SO 42 - and HCO 3 -) were determined by ion chromatography. The aqueous silica (SiO 2) concentration was measured by ICP-AES. Total alkalinity was measured by titration with 0. 1 N HCl (in the field) and 0. 02 N H 2 SO 4 (in the laboratory). The ratio of water stable isotopes was measured with a mass spectrometer and expressed in d-values, the deviations in parts per thousands (‰) from the International Standard V-SMOW. The total dissolved solids (TDS) of the surface waters ranged from 0. 65 to 6. 0 g L- 1 in the dry period (DP) and from 0. 25 to 5. 7 g L- 1 in the flow period (FP). Reservoir water was less mineralised in the FP than in the DP with an ion concentration factor of 2. 6. The pH was nearly neutral and tended to be higher in reservoir water (10. 1 in the DP and 8. 6 in the FP). The silica concentration of the reservoir water was much lower in the DP and in the FP as well. The TDS of the ground waters, located within the watershed, varied from 0. 6 to 6. 2 g L- 1 in the DP and from 0. 6 to 4. 9 g L- 1 in the FP. The pH values were mainly neutral. In the DP, total alkalinity ranged from 254 to 529 mg L- 1 {{as well as in the}} FP. Silica concentrations demonstrated relatively low variation ranging from 22 to 27 mg L- 1 in the DP and from 15 to 27 mg L- 1 in the FP. From upstream to downstream of the hill reservoir, the mineralisation of groundwater decreased, suggesting that an upstream mineralised groundwater flow is diluted by a weakly mineralised reservoir water. Three groundwater types can be distinguished in relation to the bedrock (limestone, marl, gypsiferous marl, gypsiferous mudstone, sandstone). The first type, weakly mineralised, was represented by three wells from the limestone outcrop. Bicarbonate, which ranged from 45 to 52 % mmolc L- 1 in the DP, and calcium, which was nearly 50 % mmolc L- 1, were the major ions and result from limestone weathering. The second type of groundwater included four wells, located in the marly lowlands between the limestone outcrops, and was characterised by a lower concentration of calcium and bicarbonate (30 - 40 % mmolc <b>L-</b> 1) <b>coupled</b> with a higher concentration of magnesium (20 - 30 % mmolc L- 1). Sodium was the major cation in most wells (33 - 43 % mmolc L- 1) whereas chloride was the dominant anion (45 - 67 % mmolc L- 1). In the lower part of the basin, the third type of groundwater was draining gypsiferous deposits and was dominated by calcium and sulphate ions. The reservoir water belongs to this type. Most underground waters originated from infiltrating precipitation that was not subject to surface or subsurface alteration of its isotopic composition. Groundwater located in the limestone outcrop was less enriched in stable isotopes. In the DP, reservoir water showed 2 H and 18 O enrichment, which is typical for water that has been subjected to surface evaporation. However, reservoir water is weakly mineralised, suggesting that the reservoir was an open system with more mineralised groundwater entering the reservoir and a mixed reservoir water downstream outflowing by infiltration. Downstream groundwater was weakly enriched and less mineralised than upstream groundwater. Reservoir water, which was permanently mixed, tends to be meteoric in the FP and evaporated in the DP. Physical and pedological clues indicate that the reservoir was leaking. A sandy layer (over 70 % sand), situated on the left side embankment and in the sediment of the reservoir, was nearly 1. 5 m thick with a bottom elevation above the reservoir bottom ranging from 3 to 5 m. The layer forms an aquifer resulting from the weathering of the sandstone outcrop and was connected to the downstream alluvial aquifer. The high permeability of the sandy layer partly explained the high water loss of the reservoir. Flowing through clayey materials, which contain variable amounts of easily soluble minerals, such as gypsum, and which are less permeable, the alluvial groundwater was strongly mineralised. The alluvial aquifer was supplied by shallow groundwater stored in limestone aquifers resulting in a strong decrease of the concentration. The limestone aquifers were highly porous and very transmissive. They can accumulate a high water content and rapidly recharge or discharge. The meteoric water collected in the reservoir also decreases the groundwater ion concentration leading to the same effect as the limestone groundwater...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA QCD {{inspired}} relativistic effective Hamiltonian {{model for}} mesons {{has been proposed}} based on light-front QCD effective Hamiltonian. The squared invariant rest mass operator is used as the effective Hamiltonian. The model has been improved significantly in four major aspects: i) it is proved that in constituent rest frame and in internal Hilbert subspace, the total angular momentum of mesons is conserved, the mass eigen equation can be expressed in total angular momentum representation {{and in terms of}} a set of coupled radial eigen equations; ii) a relativistic confining potential is introduced to describe the excited states; iii) an SU(3) flavor mixing interaction is included and a set of coupled mass eigen equations are obtained for different flavor components; iv) the <b>L–S</b> <b>coupling</b> and the tensor interaction are taken into full account. The model has been applied to describe the whole meson spectra of about 265 mesons with available data. The meson masses, squared radii, and decay constants are calculated, and the agreement with data is satisfying. For the mesons whose mass data have large experimental uncertainty, the model produces certain mass values for test. For some mesons whose total angular momenta and parities are not assigned experimentally, the model gives a prediction of their spectroscopic configuration LJ 2 S+ 1. The radial excitation spectra are also analyzed, the discrepancy between the calculated spectra and the data indicates angular momentum effect and higher Fock space effect for some mesons. The relation between our model and the infrared conformal scaling invariance as well as the holographic light front QCD meson model is discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} an {{increasing}} number of nuclear reactions have been studied experimentally in which more then one nucleon is transferred from the bombarding particle to the target nucleus. The reactions studied are primarily those in which two nucleons are transferred from an incident three or four nucleon complex, for example (He 3,p), (alpha,d), etc. The structure of the angular distributions seem to indicate that at high enough energies "direct" reaction mechanisms may be the predominant reaction process. In section I and II we formulate a plane wave Born Approximation direct reaction treatment of the general stripping reaction {{based on the work of}} W. Tobocman. Section III is devoted to reviewing the deuteron induced reactions using this formalism to make clear why tensor force and finite range effects are small in these reactions. The formalism is applied to the two nucleon stripping reaction, specifically the (He 3,p) reaction in Chapter IV. To investigate the importance of tensor forces we need to know the properties of the 3 -nucleon ground state wave function and of the residual nucleus wave function. A discussion of the 3 -nucleon ground state is given in Chapter V and Appendix I. A simple <b>L-S</b> <b>coupling</b> shell model for the residual nucleus is used to give explicit expressions for the cross section in Chapter VI. Finally a discussion of the importance of the tensor force and the ramifications of our formalism are given in Chapter VII, for the reaction He 4 (He 3,p) Li 6...|$|E
40|$|The {{shape and}} {{intensity}} of measured Auger peaks are strongly affected by extrinsic excitations due to electron transport out of the surface and to intrinsic excitations induced by the sudden creation of the two static core holes. Following a method developed for XPS in a previous work [N. Pauly, S. Tougaard, F. Yubero, Surf. Sci. 620 (2014) 17], we have calculated the effective energy-differential inelastic electron scattering cross-sections, including {{the effects of the}} surface and of the two core holes, within the dielectric response theory by means of the QUEELS-XPS software (QUantitative analysis of Electron Energy Losses at Surfaces for XPS). The Auger spectra are then modeled by convoluting this energy loss cross section with the primary excitation spectrum that accounts for all effects which are part of the initial Auger process, i. e. <b>L-S</b> <b>coupling</b> and vacancy satellite effects. The shape of this primary excitation spectrum is fitted to get close agreement between the theoretical and the experimental spectra obtained from X-ray excited Auger electron spectroscopy (XAES). We have performed these calculations of XAES spectra for various LMM Auger transitions of pure Cu (L 3 M 45 M 45, L 3 M 23 M 45, L 3 M 23 M 23 and L 2 M 45 M 45 transitions). We compare the resulting primary excitation spectra with theoretical results published in the literature and obtain reasonable quantitative agreement. In particular, we extract from experimental spectra quantitative intensities due to Coster-Kronig, shake-off and shake-up processes relative to the intensity from the "normal" Auger process.
