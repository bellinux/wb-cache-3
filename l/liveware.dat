5000|$|It is a slang {{term used}} to denote people using (attached to) computers, {{and is based on}} the need for a human, or <b>liveware,</b> to operate the system using {{hardware}} and software. Other words meaning the same or similar to <b>liveware</b> include wetware, meatware and jellyware. Meatware and jellyware are most often used by internal customer support personnel as slang terms when referencing human operating errors.The term <b>liveware</b> is found in the Culture novels by Iain M. Banks. A Culture Ship is named [...] "Liveware Problem". This is likely a pun on a common computing jargon hinting at the fact that the problem lies with the system's user.|$|E

50|$|This is {{a series}} of phone {{applications}} published by Marvelous <b>Liveware.</b> They are available to i-mode, EZWeb, and SoftBank Mobile users.|$|E
50|$|<b>Liveware</b> {{was used}} in the {{computer}} industry as early as 1966 to refer to computer users, often in humorous contexts, by analogy with hardware and software.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, AQ Interactive {{merged with}} Marvelous Entertainment (along with mobile gaming company <b>Liveware.)</b> The {{combined}} company became Marvelous AQL Inc., and AQ was {{absorbed into the}} Marvelous business operations.|$|E

50|$|Marvelous Inc. (previously {{known as}} Marvelous AQL) is a Japanese video game {{developer}} and anime producer that {{was formed in}} October 2011 by the merger of Marvelous Entertainment, AQ Interactive, and <b>Liveware.</b>|$|E

50|$|The SHELL Model {{does not}} {{consider}} interfaces that are {{outside the scope of}} human factors. For instance, the hardware-hardware, hardware-environment and hardware-software interfaces are not considered as these interfaces do not involve the <b>liveware</b> component.|$|E
50|$|In the epilogue, Holse, {{the lone}} {{survivor}} of the Iln encounter, rejoins his family after a long absence, accompanied by the surviving <b>Liveware</b> Problem avatoid, Quike. He declares his intention to become a political leader of a no-longer-monarchist Sarl, with the secret backing of the Culture.|$|E
50|$|The human element or worker of {{interest}} is at the centre or hub of the SHELL model that represents the modern air transportation system. The human element is the most critical and flexible component in the system, interacting directly with other system components, namely software, hardware, environment and <b>liveware.</b>|$|E
5000|$|He {{delights in}} {{building}} up expectations and then surprising the reader. Even in The Player of Games, {{which has the}} simplest style {{and structure of the}} series, the last line of the epilogue reveals who was really pulling the strings all along. In all the Culture stories, Banks subverts many clichés of space opera. The Minds are not plotting to take over the universe, and no-one is following a grand plan. The darkly comic double-act of Ferbin and Holse in Matter is not something most writers would place in [...] "the normally po-faced context of space opera". Even the names of Culture spaceships are jokes - for example Lightly Seared on the Reality Grill, Experiencing a Significant Gravitas Shortfall (part of a running gag in the series) and <b>Liveware</b> Problem (see <b>liveware).</b>|$|E
50|$|The SHELL {{model was}} first {{developed}} by Elwyn Edwards (1972) and later modified into a 'building block' structure by Frank Hawkins(1984). The model {{is named after}} the initial letters of its components (software, hardware, environment, <b>liveware)</b> and places emphasis on the human being and human interfaces with other components of the aviation system.|$|E

50|$|The {{announcement}} of merging Marvelous Entertainment Inc., AQ Interactive, Inc., <b>Liveware</b> Inc. in to Marvelous AQL Inc. on October 1, 2011 was originally proposed by Marvelous Entertainment Inc., and went effective on May 10, 2011. The plan would make Marvelous Entertainment Inc. the sole surviving entity after the merger, with Marvelous Entertainment Inc. renamed to Marvelous AQL Inc. on merger day.|$|E
50|$|Within the Culture, other {{channels}} of intelligence later validate suspicions that the Oct are planning something mysterious on Sursamen and SC contacts Anaplian en route via a humanoid avatar of the Culture ship <b>Liveware</b> Problem, Klatsli Quike. SC asks Anaplian to investigate, upgrading her bereavement travel to an official Culture mission. Quike is soon replaced by another avatoid of The <b>Liveware</b> Problem, Pone Hippinse, as Anaplian's tactical {{partner in the}} mission. Her rather irritable combat drone, Turminder Xuss, had stowed away in her belongings {{at the beginning of}} her journey, disguised initially as a Knife Missile resembling a dildo; Anaplian has had most SC tactical enhancements to her mind and body disabled for her personal journey out of diplomatic considerations, but she restores most of them, and Xuss will prove critically useful. At this point, Anaplian is reunited with her fugitive brother, Ferbin, and his faithful (but increasingly independently minded) servant Choubris Holse.|$|E
50|$|With both tyl Loesp {{and their}} brother {{dead on the}} ninth level, Anaplian and Ferbin descend towards the Shellworld's core level {{with the rest of}} the team, {{equipped}} with intelligent SC-technology combat suits. The <b>Liveware</b> Problem itself speeds down a vast shaft into the Shellworld's interior to lead the team, but sustains substantial damage from Nariscene weapons during its descent to the core. The team is thus outgunned by the Iln device, which has taken over a Morthanveld guard ship and twelve other drones secretly emplaced in the core. Xuss is MIA. Hippinse's parent ship, the <b>Liveware</b> Problem, disposes of all but two of the Morthanveld drones then sacrifices itself in a suicide attack on the hijacked Morthanveld guard ship. Hippinse himself is killed eliminating one of the remaining drones; Anaplian accounts for the last one, but the Iln entity remains too strong for the remaining compatriots, whose resources are seriously depleted.|$|E
50|$|Arriving at Sursamen {{on board}} the <b>Liveware</b> Problem, the team (Anaplian, Hippinse, Ferbin, Holse and Xuss) {{successfully}} infiltrate their {{way down to the}} Shellworld's ninth level to confront tyl Loesp, and protect their brother, Prince Oramen, both of whom are overseeing the excavation of the Nameless City. By the time the team arrives, Oramen has survived assassination attempts by tyl Loesp, but has been killed by a mysterious and powerful entity long entombed in the ancient ruins. Oramen had discovered—too late—that the entity is a ruthless machine created by or belonging to the long-dead race known as the Iln.|$|E
5000|$|The 25th Ward {{was first}} {{announced}} at the 2005 Tokyo Game Show. The game began distribution through Genki's mobile portal on October 3, 2005 for DoCoMO, EZweb, and Vodafone. Episodes were released sporadically over the next year, with updates for newer mobile phone models. The final episode of the original version, the fourth episode of the [...] "Placebo" [...] scenario, released on 3 July 2006. During the mobile version's lifespan, an original scenario dubbed [...] "Transmitter Digital Man" [...] was released on 1 June 2006, featuring the original game's protagonist Sumio Kodai. Distribution of the original version ended on 28 February 2007 due to license agreement changes between Genki and its mobile partners. The game resumed distribution through <b>Liveware</b> on 17 December 2007 for DoCoMo and Yahoo! devices after a prolonged hiatus. In addition to the original four episodes, a new episode for each story was written, with the episodes releasing on 30 April 2008. A version with enhanced graphics was released on 13 March 2009. The second mobile version of The 25th Ward shut down in May 2011.|$|E
5000|$|Examples {{of other}} Greek areas where mergers and {{establishment}} of strong teams brought directly impact and a promotion in the 1st Division, has created in advance an optimism which, did not materialize. At least, not directly. The team ends the season 1964-65 in the 5th place. The next year claimed the promotion again, improving however by two {{seats in the}} final table. The promotion was lost in a game on 8 May 1966 at Megara with the home side Vyzas opponent. During the entry of the team on the field, player Dimitrios Zambas {{was hit in the}} head by a ladder thrown from the stands and was taken to the hospital. The team with 10 players due to the elimination of Kyriakidis from the first quarter, and with 3 of the 10 remaining players injured, had formal presence, and was defeated 6-0). Disappointment was soon made its appearance...Αlthough well-known coaches like Dionysis Minardos, Giannis Helmis and Giourkas Seitaridis the first, passed of the [...] "steering wheel" [...] of the team, the downturn seemed certain, leading in 1969 with mathematical precision, in the tail of the table...The relegation would be inevitable if the political conditions of the time - Greek military junta of 1967-1974 - and the fact that teams headed by powerful men were in the same predicament, brought changes in the status of Greek football.. Therefore, Kostas Aslanidis, Lieutenant Colonel and the Secretary General of Athletics, increased the 2 groups of the Second Division to 3 and thus AEL, Chania and Ionikos continued in the B' National. In Fact, there was a rationalization of the Second Division, by creating three groups of 16 teams, of which 15 will be relegated (5 of each group) in the 3rd Division. But the effort was left unfinished. Because, ultimately there has been no relegation and it was decided the next season each group to have 18 teams. Otherwise, like the previous season, the winners of groups (three this time) went to the final phase, which claimed the promotion in the 1st Division. The team indeed, with the entrance to the 1970s, the emergence of the administrative forefront of Kantonias family (the owner of BIOKARPET Group) and a dramatic changing at <b>liveware,</b> managed to change the status. The coming of some experienced players such as Simantiris, Kyziroglou, Charitidis and Nikiforakis framed the talented Lakis Pagkarliotas and the others...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} and categorise problems in knowledge management of industrial maintenance, and support successful maintenance through adapting the SHEL model. The SHEL model has been used widely in airplane accident investigations and in aviation maintenance, but not in industrial maintenance. Adapting the SHEL model in investigating industrial maintenance Research limitations/implications – The data was collected only from Finnish companies and from the perspective of knowledge management. In practice there are also other kinds of issues in industrial maintenance. This can be a topic for future research. Practical implications – The paper presents a new systematic method to analyse and sort knowledge management problems in industrial maintenance. Both maintenance service customers and suppliers can improve their maintenance processes by using the dimensions of the SHELO model. Originality/value – The SHEL model has not been used in industrial maintenance before. In addition, the new SHELO model takes also interactions without direct human influence into account. Previous research has listed conditions for successful maintenance extensively, but this kind of prioritisation tools are needed to support decision making in practice. Keywords - Industrial maintenance, SHEL, SHELO, knowledge management, information management, qualitative data analysis Design/methodology/approach – The data was collected by two separate surveys with open-ended questions from maintenance customers and service providers in Finland. The collected data was coded according to SHEL model -derived themes and analysed thematically with NVivo. Findings – We found that the adapted SHELO model works well in the industrial maintenance context. The results show that the most important knowledge management problems in the area are caused by interactions between <b>Liveware</b> and Software (information unavailability), <b>Liveware</b> and <b>Liveware</b> (information sharing), <b>Liveware</b> and Organisation (communication), and Software and Software (information integrity) ...|$|E
