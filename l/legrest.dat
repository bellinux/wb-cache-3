40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to design an {{elevating}} <b>legrest</b> for a wheelchair that will improve circulation in the user’s legs by allowing the knees to be straight when the <b>legrest</b> is in the elevated position, and the hips and upper legs to be stationary. Individuals with Spinal Bifida, Cerebral Palsy, and Muscular Dystrophy need the assistance of mobility devices such as a wheelchair to enable their independence. These wheelchairs need to provide proper support for comfort and need to allow the individual to reposition one’s self in the chair. Changing one’s position on the wheelchair is necessary for facilitating circulation in the limbs and decreasing the under-leg soreness. The design team began by creating functional requirements for the device and analyzing the fundamental governing equations. Three preliminary designs were then generated for each aspect of the device: motion of the <b>legrest,</b> user interface, locking mechanism, and attachment mechanism. Analyses of these design concepts through prioritization of functional requirements and creation of design matrices produced a final design. The device fits on the chair and matches the arc of legs within a 13 - 17 inch range. Adjustments to the pivot location can be made vertically and horizontally at 1 / 8 ” intervals, which will accommodate the use of various sized cushions and different femur lengths between users. The pivot adjustment can work for knee locations differing by as much 3 inches, both vertically and horizontally. The team concluded by suggesting few improvements for the device such as: introducing a new material to reduce the friction between the upper and the lower section of the <b>legrest,</b> developing a new locking mechanism that increases the degree of leg flexion, etc...|$|E
40|$|For people {{bound to}} a wheelchair, {{the ability to}} elevate one 2 ̆ 7 s legs {{is as much a}} comfort concern as it is a health concern. The {{elevation}} of one 2 ̆ 7 s legs changes the user 2 ̆ 7 s sitting position, thereby increasing their comfort level {{while at the same time}} increasing circulation, ultimately aiding in the prevention of pressure sores and lower extremity swelling. Unfortunately, the motion of current legrests on manual wheelchairs does not accurately match the motion of the user 2 ̆ 7 s lower leg. This mismatch of motion causes the <b>legrest</b> to push up on the leg, shortening it while applying torque to the hip. An elevating/articulating wheelchair <b>legrest</b> that consisted of a planar sixbar linkage coupled with a worm gear set was designed and manufactured to address the shortcomings of standard elevating legrests. The <b>legrest</b> prototype elevates and articulates simultaneously from a single user interface, allowing the user 2 ̆ 7 s leg to be straight in the elevated position. The prototype design was evaluated by a potential user, his nurse, and the Director of Rehabilitation Engineering at the Massachusetts Hospital School. The collective response from this evaluation was very favorable. The design was successful in meeting the design specifications. Further modifications are needed before the design is ready for the commercial market...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{measure the}} {{response}} of a test dummy while traversing common obstacles encountered by users of electric-powered wheelchairs (EPWs) to determine whether optimal wheelchair fit, use of seatbelts, and driving speed affect the frequency and severity of EPW tips and falls. DESIGN: Repeated-measures comparison study. SETTING: Constructed environment both in and around a Veterans Affairs medical center. PARTICIPANT: A 50 th percentile Hybrid II anthropometric test dummy (ATD) was used to simulate a person driving an EPW. INTERVENTIONS: The ATD was driven in 4 different EPWs over commonly encountered obstacles at speeds of 1 and 2 m/s, with and {{without the use of}} a seatbelt, and at varying <b>legrest</b> heights. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The response and motion of the ATD were observed and recorded as no fall, loss of control (the ATD falls forward or sideways but remains in the EPW), the ATD falls out of the EPW, or the EPW tips completely. RESULTS: A total of 97 adverse events out of 1700 trials were recorded: 88 were losses of control (instability) and 9 were ATD falls. No complete tips of any EPW occurred. Univariate statistical analysis indicated a significant relationship between the adverse events and the use of seatbelts, <b>legrest</b> condition, and test obstacles (...|$|E

50|$|Powering the Teana {{was either}} a 1998 cc, 2349 cc or 3498 cc engine which matched to {{automatic}} transmission. Trim levels were 200JK, 230JK, 230JM and 350JM. The car {{was based on the}} Nissan FF-L platform. In December 2005, the Teana received new headlights and taillights, chrome trimming on the bumpers, enlarged foglights, front <b>legrests</b> and newly designed gauges. The car was also shortened slightly, and the clear rear turn signals were replaced by amber ones. XTronic CVT was also mated to all the engines.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to design an {{articulating}} elevating <b>legrest,</b> which will {{not interfere with the}} wheelchair function. Current designs for articulating wheelchair legrests do not provide the extension and elevation needed to reduce hip flexion and increase blood circulation. Existing products and patents for available articulating legrests are also not as durable as the non-articulating variety. A 2002 - 2003 MQP attempted a similar project with a manual wheelchair user as a client. The end product did not interface with the wheelchair and had other manufacturing problems, and now serves as a prototype for analysis. Evaluation of the prototype concluded that there was binding in the slider caused by a lack of planar motion and an insufficient bearing surface. To solve these problems, an articulating wheelchair <b>legrest</b> that consists of a planar six bar linkage coupled with a linear slider was designed and built. The linkage system accommodates the elevation motion while the linear slider system accommodates the extension motion. When compared to an articulating design developed by the student group in 2002 - 2003, this design decreases the overall size and weight and increases durability. The team concluded by suggesting few improvements for the device such as: machining the linear bearing system with greater precision and allowing it to self align more readily to reduce binding, incorporating a plastic shield to protect hands from moving the linkage, and placing an activation handle {{at the lower end of}} the housing for mechanical advantage...|$|E
5|$|Amtrak ordered 150 more Amfleet {{cars from}} Budd on March 13, 1980, {{at a cost}} of $150 million. These cars, dubbed Amfleet II, were {{intended}} to replace rolling stock on Amtrak long-distance trains, and featured larger windows, more legroom, and folding <b>legrests.</b> Budd delivered the first four cars on October 28, 1981; the unveiling took place on November 11. The final cars arrived on June 11, 1983. The Amfleet IIs were the last intercity cars Budd built. The continuing unreliability of the Budd Metroliner led to refurbished Amfleet I coaches displacing them in Metroliner service in 1981. New EMD AEM-7 electric locomotives pulled the trains.|$|R
50|$|Reclining or tilt-in-space wheelchairs have seating {{surfaces}} {{which can}} be tilted to various angles. The original concept was developed by an orthotist, Hugh Barclay, who worked with disabled children and observed that postural deformities such as scoliosis could be supported or partially corrected by allowing the wheelchair user to relax in a tilted position. The feature is also of value to users {{who are unable to}} sit upright for extended periods for pain or other reasons. Various designs are now available and wheelchairs with the feature may either tilt the seat-back and <b>legrests</b> in relation to the seat, or may tilt the entire back, seat and leg rest as one, depending on the need of the user.|$|R
50|$|The BMW 750iL Highline was the top-of-the-line {{model of}} the E32, with lots of added luxury for the rear {{passengers}} like full leather, dual radio controls, dual climate control with coolbox mounted in the center console, electrically heated and adjustable rear seats, walnut veneer folding tables, two crystal glasses neatly placed in the coolbox, <b>legrests,</b> and sun shade all around the rear/side windows. Complete with independent heating and ventilation, it also added a second battery in the trunk and a second alternator to provide power for all these luxuries. The 'Highline' option package cost more than 20,000 DM, and was only available on the 750iL, bringing the total price to well over twice that of a base model 730i.|$|R

50|$|The Bentley Mulsanne Extended Wheelbase ("EWB") was {{unveiled}} during the 2016 Geneva Motor Show, and was designed with the rear-seat passenger in mind. The EWB features an additional 250 mm of rear legroom over the standard model, airline-style extending <b>legrests</b> and a rear compartment sunroof. Bentley has developed optional airline-style electronic leg rests for the EWB which are seamlessly {{integrated into the}} bases of the two rear seats. These extend out and pivot, giving the choice between upright, relaxed and reclined seating positions. The large-format sunroof features an Alcantara sunblind, is standard on the EWB, and can be controlled by the passengers or the driver. An optional centre console, crafted from the finest veneer, metal, glass and leather, can be ordered to divide the rear seats. The rear seats can also be specified with folding picnic tables. Electric privacy curtains are fitted as standard to the EWB and can be tailored with either a black or ivory coloured lining. Comfort headrests, super-soft Alcantara headrest cushions and a powered Alcantara roller blind are additional options unique to the EWB.|$|R
