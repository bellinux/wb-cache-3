25|$|Because Siegel and Shuster {{were both}} Jewish, some {{religious}} commentators and pop-culture {{scholars such as}} Rabbi Simcha Weinstein and British novelist Howard Jacobson suggest that Superman's creation was partly influenced by Moses and other Jewish elements. However, Siegel and Shuster claim that having Superman {{drop out of the}} sky just seemed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea.|$|E

25|$|A {{collaboration}} is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> conversation, Nicola {{came to my}} studio {{a couple of times}} and I went to hers; we initially chatted about her music, the forthcoming album and how this related to her vision for the shoes. I went away and started designing my response to this. After our first meeting I was excited by her ideas and collaborating with people who have a strong vision is really fantastic. Nicola considers everything she does really carefully and has a totally clear view of what she wants to achieve. While the shoes are just a small part of this, I knew it would be interesting and fun to work together.|$|E
25|$|Leaping and {{arboreal}} insects seems <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{explanation for}} this evolutionary process for several reasons. Because early winged insects were lacking the sophisticated wing folding mechanism of neopterous insects, they must {{have lived in the}} open and not been able to hide or search for food under leaves, in cracks, under rocks and other such confined spaces. In these old forests there weren't many open places where insects with huge structures on their back could have lived without experiencing huge disadvantages. If insects got their wings on land and not in water, which clearly seems to be the case, the tree canopies would be the most obvious place where such gliding structures could have emerged, in a time when the air was a new territory.|$|E
25|$|Social {{activism}} {{had existed}} in Eugene {{prior to the}} mall's opening, and it had both a loyal following and an infrastructure. When Eugene acquired a large, landscaped, outdoor public-use venue with convenient public transportation, it seemed in fulfillment of deeply held social needs that were not dependent upon retail sales. People angry about the Vietnam War gathered on the mall. The mall was an ongoing location for counter-cultural activity. Retail customers experienced unhappiness at the widening generation gap. When Springfield Creamery owner Chuck Kesey, brother of author Ken Kesey, brought the Grateful Dead to the Oregon Renaissance Faire to play a benefit concert for the creamery in 1972, the Eugene Mall seemed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> waiting room for the next concert. That concert did not occur until 1982.|$|E

25|$|Philostratus devoted {{two and a}} half of {{the eight}} books of his Life of Apollonius (1.19–3.58) to the {{description}} of a journey of his hero to India. According to Philostratus' Life, en route to the Far East, Apollonius reached Hierapolis Bambyce (Manbij) in Syria (not Nineveh, as some scholars believed), where he met Damis, a native of that city who became his lifelong companion. Pythagoras, whom the Neo-Pythagoreans regarded as an exemplary sage, was believed to have travelled to India. Hence such a feat made Apollonius look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> Pythagorean who spared no pains in his efforts to discover the sources of oriental piety and wisdom. As some details in Philostratus’ account of the Indian adventure seem incompatible with known facts, modern scholars are inclined to dismiss the whole story as a fanciful fabrication, but not all of them {{rule out the possibility that}} the Tyanean actually did visit India.|$|E
25|$|Since the MNF {{schedule}} {{is set in}} April and cannot be changed, the league and network cannot guarantee a late season matchup will have any significance or be highly anticipated. Teams thought to be good during the off-season could be out of playoff contention {{by the middle of}} the season; a prime example occurred in 1999, when the San Francisco 49ers and Atlanta Falcons both entered the season's final MNF game with 4–11 records. It had seemed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> pre-season matchup since the Falcons had played in the previous season's Super Bowl and the 49ers coming into the 1999 season had posted 16 consecutive 10-win seasons. It is also possible for a team like the 1999 St. Louis Rams not to be scheduled for a Monday night game because of its dismal record the year before, and many other NFL teams (such as the 2004 San Diego Chargers, with zero primetime games) have had huge unforeseen turnarounds that result in lack of MNF attention (these teams generally receive multiple MNF spots the year after their breakout success, which is great for viewers if those teams continue to play well, and not so great if they return to mediocrity or worse). However, the forecasting abilities of the NFL's scheduling officials have exhibited uncanny proficiency. Many MNF games occurring later in the season feature at least one team that is either headed to the playoffs or must win the MNF game to clinch a playoff spot.|$|E
500|$|In addition, Thomas turned {{what was}} {{scheduled}} to be the third major mystery into a two-episode storyline, with the last five episodes of the season being stand-alone. He stated, [...] "It seems <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time to do it—a good fun test balloon." [...] Nevertheless, he confirmed that there would be ongoing stories in Veronica's personal life. A week prior to the episode's airing, Michael Ausiello received an advance screening of the episode, revealing several details that the network allowed him to divulge.|$|E

In the British market, The Times Literary Supplement also characterised McNeile as a mass-market thriller writer, which contrasted with its consideration of his earlier works.|$|E

Anne George's 1996 novel Murder on a Bad Hair Day: A Southern Sisters Mystery, and the 2004 novel Making Waves by Cassandra King, Grapico mixed with Absolut Peppar jalapeño flavored vodka is a drink called the Ex-girlfriend. It's called the Ex-girlfriend because [...] "it's sweet and seems <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea, but eventually it's {{going to burn}} you and make you sick."

500|$|The spanking thing started because I {{believed}} that my character in Dick Tracy liked to get smacked around and that's why she hung around {{with people like}} Al Pacino's character.

I say in the song 'Nothing <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> spanky', {{and in the middle}} I say, 'Ooh, my bottom hurts just thinking about it'. When it came out everybody started asking, 'Do you like to get spanked?' and I said: 'Yeah. Yeah, I do'.|$|E

Mathew Knowles said he was testing the reactions, and, judging by what he had heard, [...] "it seems <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea". Later in August, however, Beyoncé said it was only a rumor and Destiny's Child would remain a trio. Rowland added, [...] "She's a solo star," [...] name-dropping Knowles's debut album.|$|E

500|$|The Bold Bank Robbery was {{inspired}} by and created after {{the success of the}} 1903 western film The Great Train Robbery; other inspirations included American and European crime films. Lubin Manufacturing Company had been known to produce films similar to other popular ones; film historian Kemp R. Niver observed that [...] "if it seemed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea, and other film producers were making money, 'Pop' Lubin simply appropriated the title and remade or duped the motion picture." [...] Siegmund Lubin filed a copyright for the film on July 25, 1904. The finished product comprised 600 feet (182 m) of film.|$|E
5000|$|The later {{versions}} generally scored {{slightly lower}} in the muti-format magazines with ACE giving the Amiga and ST versions 925 and 920 respectively, while The Games Machine gave both the ST and DOS versions 80%.

25|$|Tram engines {{had their}} wheels and motion {{enclosed}} to avoid accidents in traffic. They also had cow catchers to avoid road debris causing a derailment. Some tram engines were {{fitted with a}} roof and enclosed sides, giving them <b>an</b> appearance more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>goods</b> wagon than <b>a</b> locomotive.

500|$|Jeff Segstack of GameSpot {{gave the}} game high marks, {{explaining}} {{that it is}} [...] "a leisurely paced, all-encompassing, mentally challenging experience.

Laura Miller of Salon declared that [...] "Art [...] is what Riven approaches," [...] and praised the gameplay as having [...] "a graceful elegance that reminds [...] of a masterfully constructed novel."
