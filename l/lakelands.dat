It lies on a low spur of the Cumberland range of mountains on a little tributary of the Clinch River. <b>Lakelands</b> proper is a contented village of two dozen houses situated on a forlorn, narrow-gauge railroad line. You wonder whether the railroad lost itself in the pine woods and ran into <b>Lakelands</b> from fright and loneliness, or whether <b>Lakelands</b> got lost and huddled itself along the railroad to wait for the cars to carry it home.|$|E

60|$|When Abram Strong became prosperous {{he paid a}} {{visit to}} <b>Lakelands</b> and the old mill. The scene was a sad one for him, but he was a strong man, and always {{appeared}} cheery and kindly. It was then that he was inspired to convert the old mill into a church. <b>Lakelands</b> was too poor to build one; and the still poorer mountaineers could not assist.

60|$|Father Abram came a {{long way}} to <b>Lakelands.</b> He lived in a big, roaring town in the Northwest where he owned mills, not little mills with pews and an organ in them, but great, ugly, mountain-like mills that the freight trains crawled around all day like ants around an ant-heap. And now you must be told about Father Abram and the mill that was a church, for their stories run together.|$|E
6000|$|Every {{year about}} the {{beginning}} of autumn there came to the Eagle House one Abram Strong, who remained for a time an honoured and beloved guest. In <b>Lakelands</b> he was called [...] "Father Abram," [...] because his hair was so white, his face so strong and kind and florid, his laugh so merry, and his black clothes and broad hat so priestly in appearance. Even new guests after three or four days' acquaintance gave him this familiar title.|$|E
60|$|Miss Chester was {{not very}} strong. She was about twenty, and pale and {{delicate}} from an indoor life. But one week of <b>Lakelands</b> gave her a brightness and spirit that changed her wonderfully. The time was early September when the Cumberlands are at their greatest beauty. The mountain foliage was growing brilliant with autumnal colours; one breathed aerial champagne, the nights were deliciously cool, causing one to snuggle cosily under the warm blankets of the Eagle House.|$|E

6000|$|Late one {{afternoon}} Father Abram {{set out for}} the old mill alone. He often went to sit and think of the old days when he lived in the cottage across the road. Time had smoothed away the sharpness of his grief until he no longer found the memory of those times painful. But whenever Abram Strong sat in the melancholy September afternoons on the spot where [...] "Dums" [...] used to run in every day with her yellow curls flying, the smile that <b>Lakelands</b> always saw upon his face was not there.|$|E
6000|$|The {{patrons of}} the Eagle House are those who seek {{recreation}} as a necessity, {{as well as a}} pleasure. They are busy people, who may be likened to clocks that need a fortnight's winding to insure a year's running of their wheels. You will find students there from the lower towns, now and then an artist, or a geologist absorbed in construing the ancient strata of the hills. A few quiet families spend the summers there; and often one or two tired members of that patient sisterhood known to <b>Lakelands</b> as [...] "schoolmarms." ...|$|E
60|$|That {{season the}} Eagle House had fewer guests than usual. Among them was Rose Chester. Miss Chester came to <b>Lakelands</b> from Atlanta, {{where she worked}} in a {{department}} store. This was the first vacation outing of her life. The wife of the store manager had once spent a summer at the Eagle House. She had taken a fancy to Rose, and had persuaded her to go there for her three weeks' holiday. The manager's wife gave her a letter to Mrs. Rankin, who gladly received her in her own charge and care.|$|E

60|$|When {{you visit}} <b>Lakelands</b> {{they will tell}} you more of this story. They will tell you how the lines of it were {{afterward}} traced, and the history of the miller's daughter revealed after the gipsy wanderers had stolen her on that September day, attracted by her childish beauty. But you should wait until you sit comfortably on the shaded porch of the Eagle House, and then you can have the story at your ease. It seems best that our part of it should close while Miss Phoebe's deep bass note was yet reverberating softly.|$|E
60|$|Miss Chester was {{fortunate}} in gaining Father Abram {{for a friend}} and companion. He knew every road and peak and slope of the mountains near <b>Lakelands.</b> Through him she became acquainted with the solemn delight of the shadowy, tilted aisles of the pine forests, {{the dignity of the}} bare crags, the crystal, tonic mornings, the dreamy, golden afternoons full of mysterious sadness. So her health improved, and her spirits grew light. She had a laugh as genial and hearty in its feminine way as the famous laugh of Father Abram. Both of them were natural optimists; and both knew how to present a serene and cheerful face to the world.|$|E
60|$|It was the {{old story}} that always seems so big and {{important}} to the young, and that brings reminiscent smiles to their elders. Love was the theme, as may be supposed. There {{was a young man}} in Atlanta, full of all goodness and the graces, who had discovered that Miss Chester also possessed these qualities above all other people in Atlanta or anywhere else from Greenland to Patagonia. She showed Father Abram the letter over which she had been weeping. It was a manly, tender letter, a little superlative and urgent, after the style of love letters written by young men full of goodness and the graces. He proposed for Miss Chester's hand in marriage at once. Life, he said, since her departure for a three-weeks' visit, was not to be endured. He begged for an immediate answer; and if it were favourable he promised to fly, ignoring the narrow-gauge railroad, at once to <b>Lakelands.</b>|$|E

60|$|The miller {{altered the}} {{appearance}} of the mill as little as possible. The big overshot-wheel was left in its place. The young people who came to the church used to cut their initials in its soft and slowly decaying wood. The dam was partly destroyed, and the clear mountain stream rippled unchecked down its rocky bed. Inside the mill the changes were greater. The shafts and millstones and belts and pulleys were, of course, all removed. There were two rows of benches with aisles between, and a little raised platform and pulpit at one end. On three sides overhead was a gallery containing seats, and reached by a stairway inside. There was also an organ--a real pipe organ--in the gallery, that was the pride of the congregation of the Old Mill Church. Miss Phoebe Summers was the organist. The <b>Lakelands</b> boys proudly took turns at pumping it for her at each Sunday's service. The Rev. Mr. Banbridge was the preacher, and rode down from Squirrel Gap on his old white horse without ever missing a service. And Abram Strong paid for everything. He paid the preacher five hundred dollars a year; and Miss Phoebe two hundred dollars.|$|E
