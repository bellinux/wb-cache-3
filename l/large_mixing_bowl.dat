5000|$|Put in a <b>large</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>bowl</b> 2 cups {{boiling water}} and 1/2 cup cornmeal. Stir thoroughly. Let stand one hour. Add 1/2 cup molasses, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 {{tablespoon}} butter. Put {{in a small bowl}} 1/2 cup lukewarm water and 1 package yeast. When dissolved, add to the cornmeal. Stir in 4 1/2 cups flour. Beat thoroughly and let rise until double in bulk. Add enough more flour to make the dough just firm enough to knead. Shape into loaves and put into buttered pans. Let rise until almost double. Bake about 50 minutes at 350°. Makes 2 loaves. White flour will make the most [...] "addictive" [...] Anadama, but experiment with whole wheat, rye and other flours to make more healthful loaves.|$|E

The conical shaped <b>mixing</b> <b>bowls</b> are the most prevalent, and are often confused with Bauer Pottery's ringware <b>mixing</b> <b>bowls.</b> Vases and gardenware (flower pots, bowls, jardinieres) were also very popular during the period.|$|R

50|$|Food {{processing}} {{is typically}} a mechanical process that utilizes <b>large</b> <b>mixing,</b> grinding, chopping and emulsifying {{equipment in the}} production process. These processes inherently introduce a number of contamination risks. As a <b>mixing</b> <b>bowl</b> or grinder is used over time the food contact parts will tend to fail and fracture. This type of failure will introduce into the product stream small to large metal contaminants. Further processing of these metal fragments will result in downstream equipment failure {{and the risk of}} ingestion by the consumer. Food manufacturers utilize industrial metal detectors to detect and reject automatically any metal fragment. Large food processors will utilize many metal detectors within the processing stream to reduce both damage to processing machinery as well as risk to consumer health.|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the mystique}} of {{materials}} and process is a constant dilemma to the inexperienced industrial designer. A sketch is made, geometry is created and the young designer asks, “How can this design be manufactured? ” “What process do I use to create this shape? ” The intent {{of this paper is}} to discuss my thesis research at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The development of the <b>Mixing</b> <b>Bowl</b> Methodology was to create an interactive object-based learning experience that could transform resin-forming principles into a learning environment. Constructivist methodologies are applied through an interactive primer with the intent of teaching materials and processes for the entry-level design student. <b>Mixing</b> <b>Bowl</b> Methodology interprets three different <b>mixing</b> <b>bowl</b> aesthetics, which corresponds to resin forming theory, featuring a range of molding configurations, from simple to complex. There are three bowls representing three market aesthetics; highend, mid-range and low-end design forms. The <b>mixing</b> <b>bowls</b> were created using parametric solids modeling. Each bowl type will have a corresponding story discussing design aesthetics and geometric theory as it relates to the molding process. The essence of my thesis work is a combined learning experience of the virtual tutorial and a corresponding physical model, th...|$|R
