50|$|Cryptochrome, {{like many}} genes {{involved}} in circadian rhythm, shows circadian cycling in mRNA and protein <b>levels.</b> <b>In</b> Drosophila, Cry mRNA concentrations cycle under a light-dark cycle (LD), with high <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> light and low <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> the dark. This cycling persists in constant darkness (DD), but with decreased amplitude. The transcription of the Cry gene also cycles {{with a similar}} trend. CRY protein <b>levels,</b> however, cycle <b>in</b> a different manner than Cry transcription and mRNA <b>levels.</b> <b>In</b> LD, CRY protein has low <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> light and high <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> dark, and, <b>in</b> DD, CRY <b>levels</b> increase continuously throughout the subjective day and night. Thus, CRY expression is regulated by the clock {{at the transcriptional level}} and by light at the translational and posttranslational level.|$|R

40|$|Diabetic {{patients}} have abnormal cardiac energy metabolism {{associated with high}} plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations. We investigated whether high plasma FFAs increase mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP) <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> the mouse heart by activating the nuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha. We used Western blotting to measure UCP protein <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> isolated cardiac mitochondria from PPARalpha-/- and diabetic mice. Cardiac UCP 2 and UCP 3 were significantly lower in the PPARalpha-/- mouse than in the wild type. Treatment with the PPARalpha-specific agonist, WY- 14, 643, increased cardiac UCP 2 and UCP 3 <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> wild-type mice but did not alter UCP <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> PPARalpha-/- mice. Inhibition of beta-oxidation with etomoxir increased cardiac UCP 2 and UCP 3 <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> wild-type mice and UCP 2 <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> PPARalpha-/- mice but did not alter UCP 3 <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> PPARalpha-/- mice. Streptozotocin treatment, which increased circulating FFAs by 91 %, did not alter cardiac UCP 2 <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> wild-type or PPARalpha-/- mice but increased UCP 3 <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> wild-type, and not in PPARalpha-/-, mice. The diabetic db/db mouse had 50 % higher plasma FFA concentrations and elevated cardiac UCP 2 and UCP 3 protein levels. We conclude that high plasma FFAs activated PPARalpha to increase cardiac UCP 3 levels, but cardiac UCP 2 levels changed via PPARalpha-dependent and -independent mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Morphine {{raised the}} levels of {{intravenously}} administered ampicillin in the plasma of mice. Despite higher ampicillin <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> plasma after administration of morphine, levels of this antibiotic in bile and urine were not elevated. After ligation of the common bile duct, ampicillin <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> plasma were elevated. Morphine caused a further rise <b>in</b> drug <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> plasma of duct-ligated mice. Ampicillin <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> plasma were higher in mice made anephric by prolonged ligation of their external urethras. In such animals, morphine also caused ampicillin <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> plasma to be even higher. These experiments suggest that morphine impairs both renal and hepatobiliary elimination of ampicillin. These effects of morphine were completely reversed by naloxone. In contrast to effects on intravenously administered ampicillin, morphine markedly reduced drug <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> plasma when ampicillin was given by gastric intubation. This resulted from delayed absorption because of retardation of gastric emptying by morphine...|$|R
