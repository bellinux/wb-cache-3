40|$|<b>Lead</b> hazard control {{measures}} to reduce children’s exposure to household <b>lead</b> sources often result in only limited reductions in blood <b>lead</b> levels. This {{may be due}} to incomplete remediation of <b>lead</b> sources and/or to the remobilization of <b>lead</b> stores from bone, which may act as an endogenous <b>lead</b> source that buffers reductions in blood <b>lead</b> levels. Here we present a noninvasive isotopic approach to estimate the magnitude of the bone <b>lead</b> contribution to blood in children following household <b>lead</b> remediation. In this approach, <b>lead</b> isotopic ratios of a child’s blood and 5 -day fecal samples are determined before and after a household intervention aimed at reducing the child’s <b>lead</b> intake. The bone <b>lead</b> contribution to blood is estimated from a system of mass balance equations of <b>lead</b> concentrations and isotopic compositions in blood at the different times of sample collection. The utility of this method is illustrated with three cases of children with blood <b>lead</b> levels in the range of 18 – 29 µg/dL. In all three cases, the release of <b>lead</b> from bone supported a substantial fraction of the measured blood <b>lead</b> level postintervention, up to 96 % in one case. In general, the <b>lead</b> isotopic compositions of feces matched or were within the range of the <b>lead</b> isotopic compositions of the household dusts with <b>lead</b> loadings exceeding U. S. Environmental Protection Agency action levels. This isotopic agreement underscores the utility of <b>lead</b> isotopic measurements of feces to identify household sources of <b>lead</b> exposure. Results from this limited number of cases support the hypothesis that the release of bone <b>lead</b> into blood may substantially buffer the decrease in blood <b>lead</b> levels expected from the reduction in <b>lead</b> intake.

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{has raised the}} possibility that fetal <b>lead</b> exposure is not estimated adequately by measuring <b>lead</b> content in maternal whole blood <b>lead</b> because of the variable partitioning of <b>lead</b> in whole blood between plasma and red blood cells. <b>Lead</b> in maternal plasma may derive in large part from maternal bone <b>lead</b> stores. In this study we aimed to estimate the contribution of maternal whole blood <b>lead,</b> maternal bone <b>lead</b> levels, and environmental <b>lead</b> to umbilical cord blood <b>lead</b> levels (as a measure of fetal <b>lead</b> exposure). In the model, we assumed that <b>lead</b> from all of these sources reaches the fetus through the maternal plasma <b>lead</b> pathway. In 1994 - 1995, we recruited 615 pregnant women {{for a study of}} <b>lead</b> exposure and reproductive outcomes in Mexico City. We gathered maternal and umbilical cord blood samples within 12 hr of each infant's delivery and measured maternal <b>lead</b> levels in cortical bone and trabecular bone by a K-X-ray fluorescence (K-XRF) instrument within 1 month after delivery. We administered a questionnaire to assess use of lead-glazed ceramics (LGC) to cook food and we obtained data on regional air <b>lead</b> levels during the 2 months before delivery. We used structural equation models (SEMs) to estimate plasma <b>lead</b> as the unmeasured (latent) variable and to quantify the interrelations of plasma <b>lead,</b> the other <b>lead</b> biomarkers, and environmental <b>lead</b> exposure. In the SEM analysis, a model that allowed plasma <b>lead</b> to vary freely from whole blood <b>lead</b> explained the variance of cord blood <b>lead</b> (as reflected by a total model R(2); R(2) = 0. 79) better than did a model without plasma <b>lead</b> (r(2) = 0. 67). Cortical bone <b>lead,</b> trabecular bone <b>lead,</b> use of LGC, and mean air <b>lead</b> level contributed significantly to plasma <b>lead.</b> The exchange of <b>lead</b> between plasma and red blood cells was mostly in the direction of plasma to cells. According to the final model, an increase in trabecular bone <b>lead</b> and cortical bone <b>lead</b> was associated with increases in cord blood <b>lead</b> of 0. 65 and 0. 25 microg/dL, respectively. An increase of 0. 1 microg/m(3) in air <b>lead</b> was associated with an increase in the mean level of fetal cord blood <b>lead</b> by 0. 67 microg/dL. With one additional day of LCG use per week in the peripartum period, the mean fetal blood <b>lead</b> level increased by 0. 27 microg/dL. Our analyses suggested that maternal plasma <b>lead</b> varies independently from maternal whole blood <b>lead</b> and that the greatest influences on maternal plasma <b>lead</b> are maternal bone <b>lead</b> stores, air <b>lead</b> exposures, and recent cooking with LGC. The contributions from endogenous (bone) and exogenous (environmental) sources were relatively equal. Measurement of plasma and bone <b>lead</b> may be important in accurately assessing fetal <b>lead</b> exposure and its major sources, particularly if exogenous exposures decline...|$|R

The dose-response relationship between occupational cumulative <b>lead</b> exposure and <b>lead</b> poisoning, abnormal blood <b>lead,</b> urinary <b>lead</b> and erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) were analyzed and the benchmark dose lower bound confidence limits (BMDLs) were calculated. Statistically significant positive correlations were found between cumulative <b>lead</b> dust and <b>lead</b> fumes exposures and workplace seniority, blood <b>lead,</b> urinary <b>lead</b> and ZPP values. A dose-response relationship was observed between cumulative <b>lead</b> dust or <b>lead</b> fumes exposure and <b>lead</b> poisoning (p < 0. 01).

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{examine the}} interrelations among chelatable <b>lead</b> (by dimercaptosuccinic acid, DMSA), tibial <b>lead,</b> and blood <b>lead</b> {{concentrations}} in 802  Korean workers with occupational exposure to <b>lead</b> and 135  employed controls with only environmental exposure to <b>lead.</b>  METHODS—This was a cross sectional study wherein tibial <b>lead,</b> DMSA chelatable <b>lead,</b> and blood <b>lead</b> were measured. Linear regression {{was used to}} identify predictors of the three <b>lead</b> biomarkers, evaluating the influence of age, job duration, sex, education level, alcohol and tobacco use, creatinine clearance rate, and body mass index.  RESULTS—DMSA chelatable <b>lead</b> concentrations ranged from 4. 8  to 2102. 9  µg and were positively associated with age, current smoking, and creatinine clearance rate. On average, women had 64  µg less DMSA chelatable <b>lead</b> than men. When blood <b>lead</b> and its square were added to a model with age, sex, current smoking, body mass index, and creatinine clearance rate, blood <b>lead</b> accounted for the largest proportion of the variance and sex became of borderline significance. Tibial <b>lead</b> concentrations ranged from − 7 to 338  µg/g bone mineral and were positively associated with age, job duration, and body mass index. Women had, on average, 9. 7  µg/g less tibial <b>lead</b> than men. Blood <b>lead</b> concentrations ranged from 4. 3  to 85. 7  µg/dl and were positively associated with age and tibial <b>lead,</b> whereas current smokers had higher blood <b>lead</b> concentrations and women had lower blood <b>lead</b> concentrations.  CONCLUSIONS—The data suggest that age and sex are both predictors of DMSA chelatable <b>lead,</b> blood <b>lead,</b> and tibial <b>lead</b> concentrations and that tibial <b>lead</b> stores in older subjects are less bioavailable and may contribute less to blood <b>lead</b> concentrations than tibial <b>lead</b> stores in younger subjects.
