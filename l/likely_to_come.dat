5|$|SVT {{made the}} advance {{decision}} to allocate Denmark at one semi-final and Norway at the other, in {{consideration for the}} number of Danish and Norwegian fans <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> with the arena being relatively small and so not suitable for accommodating both countries' fans at one semi-final event. Øresund bridge was eventually also used as the main artistic medium for the theme of the contest, as an expression of binding cultures.|$|E
5|$|Social wasps are {{considered}} pests {{when they become}} excessively common, or nest close to buildings. People are most often stung in late summer, when wasp colonies stop breeding new workers; the existing workers search for sugary foods and are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> into contact with humans; if people then respond aggressively, the wasps sting. Wasp nests made in or near houses, such as in roof spaces, can present a danger as the wasps may sting if people come close to them. Stings are usually painful rather than dangerous, but in rare cases, people may suffer life-threatening anaphylactic shock.|$|E
5|$|Alloxylon flammeum {{is listed}} nationally as {{vulnerable}} under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), {{which indicates that}} there is a high risk it will become extinct in the wild in the mid-term future. Before the establishment of the EPBC Act, it was, and currently remains, listed as vulnerable under the state-based Nature Conservation Act 1992. Furthermore, it was listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 1997. Most of its habitat has been cleared for agriculture and development. Remaining stands in protected areas are highly fragmented. Furthermore, plants in cultivation are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from a limited genetic pool. With under 2% of its original extent remaining, the rainforest is threatened by invasive plants and grazing by feral and domestic animals.|$|E
60|$|The Jack at the Ship was {{instructed}} where the drowned man had gone down, and undertook {{to search for}} the body in the places where it was <b>likeliest</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> ashore. His interest in its recovery {{seemed to me to be}} much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on. Probably, it took about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely; and that may have been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in various stages of decay.|$|R

5|$|Senate {{and house}} legislators who had favored Benton's renegotiated {{version of the}} Texas {{annexation}} bill had been assured that President Tyler would sign the joint house measure, but leave its implementation to the incoming Polk administration. But, during his last day in office, President Tyler, with the urging of his Secretary of State Calhoun, decided to act decisively to improve the odds for the immediate annexation of Texas. On March 3, 1845, with his cabinet's assent, he dispatched an offer of annexation to the Republic of Texas by courier, exclusively {{under the terms of}} the Brown–Foster option of the joint house measure. Secretary Calhoun apprised President-elect Polk of the action, who demurred without comment. Tyler justified his preemptive move on the grounds that Polk was <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> under pressure to abandon immediate annexation and reopen negotiations under the Benton alternative.|$|E
5|$|Superman the Ride has {{undergone}} numerous safety upgrades. After the 2001 incident, the PVC airlines were replaced with steel reinforced air hoses {{to prevent a}} similar accident from occurring. After the 2004 incident, metal bars were installed {{on both sides of}} the “T-bar” restraint, encasing the rider's legs. Shin restraints were added to the lower portion of the restraint, preventing riders’ feet from leaving the car. In addition, all of the seat belts on both 36-passenger trains were replaced with ones at a consistent length, as well as a “go or no go” belt for each seat and “T-bar” restraint. The “go or no go” belt ensured the “T-bar” restraint was in an effective position before leaving the station. During the 2009 rebranding, new trains were deployed with new restraints added. The new lapbars eliminated the center pole, leaving only the exterior poles. New seat belts provided more strength and were less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> undone unintentionally.|$|E
5|$|The {{entirety}} of Pacific City may be explored {{from the start}} of the game, allowing the player to locate the hideouts of each General and Kingpin, which can be made easier by accessing supply points scattered around the city. Once a supply point is unlocked, the player has the option of returning there to travel to any other supply point, restock on weapons and ammunition, or drop off newly acquired weapons, to permanently add them to their weapon selection. Should the player die, they can respawn at any open supply point. While exploring, the player is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> across enemy resistance, with their aggressiveness based on how badly the player has damaged that particular gang recently. If the player is too aggressive against the non-gang residents of Pacific City, including the Peacekeepers, they are flagged as rogue, and Agency hit squads are dispatched to take them down.|$|E
5000|$|The club's {{nickname}} of [...] "The Bees", {{reflected in}} their amber and black shirts, is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>come</b> from the location of apiaries close to the Underhill ground {{in the early years}} of the 20th century.|$|R

5|$|Australian ravens die {{most often}} by being shot or poisoned—generally by farmers. Despite their fondness for roadkill, fewer ravens are hit by {{vehicles}} than Australian magpies. Research in the 1950s and 60s showed that 64% of Australian ravens perished {{in their first}} year of life. Immature birds are most at risk of dying as they are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> into conflict with farmers. The Australian Raven is a peaceful bird, showing no aggression toward humans or other birds without reason. However, the Australian raven is frequently blamed for the loss of young lambs. Scientific observation in the country's southeast showed that the killing of healthy lambs was rare, but that sick animals were predisposed to being attacked. Australian ravens mostly eat faeces (often from the lamb's anus), afterbirth or stillborn lambs. Newborn lamb faeces is nutritious, containing around 21–44% protein, 9–37% fat and 10–30% carbohydrate. It has the consistency of treacle and often sticks to the lamb's hindquarters or tail. The raven bites a sleeping lamb's tail, holding on and walking behind it when it wakes up. A healthy lamb would respond by running away or butting the bird, but a sick one might not respond and be attacked further as it alerts the bird that it is vulnerable. Wounded lambs can also succumb to Clostridium infection as these bacteria are present on raven bills. Ravens bring some benefits to agricultural areas as they clean away carrion and eat insects that are potentially damaging to crops. In areas of Western Australia, the species is classified as a Declared Pest of Agriculture under the provisions of the Agriculture and Related Resources Protection Act 1976, meaning that shooting on private land in rural areas is legal, although should be considered only after other options have been exhausted.|$|E
5|$|Many of the pre-game and in-game {{strategic}} {{decisions in}} baseball revolve around a fundamental fact: in general, right-handed batters {{tend to be}} more successful against left-handed pitchers and, to an even greater degree, left-handed batters {{tend to be more}} successful against right-handed pitchers. A manager with several left-handed batters in the regular lineup who knows the team will be facing a left-handed starting pitcher may respond by starting {{one or more of the}} right-handed backups on the team's roster. During the late innings of a game, as relief pitchers and pinch hitters are brought in, the opposing managers will often go back and forth trying to create favorable matchups with their substitutions: the manager of the fielding team trying to arrange same-handed pitcher-batter matchups, the manager of the batting team trying to arrange opposite-handed matchups. With a team that has the lead in the late innings, a manager may remove a starting position player—especially one whose turn at bat is not <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up again—for a more skillful fielder. Furthermore, unlike players in most team sports, baseball players can not return to a game after being replaced; this creates a greater risk when making lineup changes, especially as a team's pitching staff may be increasingly depleted in the late innings of a game, particularly one which goes into multiple extra innings.|$|E

25|$|Helium dissolves into tissues (this {{is called}} on-gassing) {{more rapidly than}} {{nitrogen}} as the ambient pressure is increased. A consequence of the higher loading in some tissues is that many decompression algorithms require deeper decompression stops than a similar decompression dive using air, and helium is more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out of solution and cause decompression sickness following a fast ascent.|$|E
25|$|According to the 1990 U.S. Census 168,659 of {{the total}} 202,658 {{documented}} Nicaraguans in the U.S. were born in Nicaragua. In 1992 approximately 10–12% of the Nicaraguan population had emigrated. These emigrants tended to be disproportionately of working age, better educated, and more often white-collar workers than nonmigrants. In addition, emigrants were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from larger premigration households and higher income households.|$|E
25|$|Cassan {{has studied}} the {{differential}} effect within two segments of India's Dalit community.

Cassan further concludes that legal and social program initiatives are no longer India's primary constraint in further advancement of India's historically discriminated castes; further advancement are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from improvements in the supply of quality schools in rural and urban India, along with India's economic growth.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{fragments}} of scrolls have neither significant archaeological provenance nor records that reveal in which designated Qumran cave area they were found.

50|$|The word killifish is of {{uncertain}} origin, but is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>come</b> {{from the}} Dutch kil for a kill (small stream).

25|$|Despite {{an average}} {{reduction}} in deaths in custody since 2004, a 2014 Public Confidence Survey revealed that public satisfaction following {{contact with the}} police was falling {{and that there was}} a greater willingness to complain. The Metropolitan Police, who operate {{in some of the most}} ethnically diverse parts of the UK, received the greatest number of complaints in 2014/15 with 6,828. However, young people and people from black or minority ethic groups were much less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> forward with complaints.|$|E
25|$|In {{a random}} {{sequence}} of numbers, a number {{may be said}} to be cursed because it has come up less often in the past, and so it is thought that it will occur less often in the future. A number may be assumed to be blessed because it has occurred more often than others in the past, and so it is thought <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up more often in the future. This logic is valid only if the randomisation is biased, for example with a loaded die. If the die is fair, then previous rolls give no indication of future events.|$|E
25|$|Emerging {{research}} suggests that gay men from religious backgrounds are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out online via Facebook and Blogs as it offers a protective interpersonal distance. This largely contradicts the growing movement in social media research indicating that online use, particularly Facebook, can lead to negative mental health outcomes such as increased levels of anxiety. While {{further research is needed}} to assess whether these results generalize to a larger sample, these recent findings open the door to the possibility that gay men's online experiences may differ from heterosexuals' in that it may be more likely to provide mental health benefits than consequences.|$|E
5000|$|The mediocrity {{principle}} is the philosophical notion that [...] "if an item is drawn at random {{from one of}} several sets or categories, it's <b>likelier</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from the most numerous category than from {{any one of the}} less numerous categories". The principle has been taken to suggest that there is nothing very unusual about the evolution of the Solar System, Earth's history, the evolution of biological complexity, human evolution, or any one nation. It is a heuristic in the vein of the Copernican principle, and is sometimes used as a philosophical statement about the place of humanity. The idea is to assume mediocrity, rather than starting with the assumption that a phenomenon is special, privileged, exceptional, or even superior.|$|R
