Partial objects of <b>picture</b> <b>elements</b> of one type are determined based on comparison {{with one of the}} thresholds, and <b>picture</b> <b>elements</b> of another type are determined based on comparison with the other threshold. Two of the partial objects are combined to an extended partial object by the <b>picture</b> <b>elements</b> of the latter type. The partial object to be detected is described by a sum of the partial objects and/or the sum of the acquired extended partial objects. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a computer program comprising a set of instructions to perform a method of detecting an object on an image representable by <b>picture</b> <b>elements</b> (2) an apparatus for detecting an object on an image representable by <b>picture</b> <b>elements,</b> comprising a determiner.

40|$|Traditional stereo {{techniques}} determine range by relating {{two images}} {{of an object}} viewed from different directions. If the correspondence between <b>picture</b> <b>elements</b> is known, then distance to the object can be calculated by triangulation. Unfortunately, {{it is difficult to}} determine this correspondence. This paper introduces a novel technique called photometric stereo. The idea of photometric stereo is to vary the direction of the incident illumination between successive views while holding the viewing direction constant. This provides enough information to determine surface orientation at each <b>picture</b> <b>element.</b> Since the imaging geometry does not change, the correspondence between <b>picture</b> <b>elements</b> is known a priori. This stereo technique is photometric because it uses the intensity values recorded in a single <b>picture</b> <b>element,</b> in successive views, rather than the relative positions of features...|$|R

The product of the number of lines and the number of maximum sine signals per line is known as the total resolution of the frame. The higher the resolution the more faithful the displayed image is to the original image. But higher resolution introduces technical problems and extra cost. So a compromise should be reached in system designs both for satisfactory image quality and affordable price.|$|R
