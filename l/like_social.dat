25|$|The {{identity}} fusion construct builds upon {{earlier work}} by emphasizing {{aspects of the}} relationship of people to groups that were de-emphasized within the social identity perspective (i.e., social identity theory and self-categorization theory). <b>Like</b> <b>social</b> identity theory, identity fusion theory rests on the distinction between the personal and social identities. However, the social identity approach assumes that there is a hydraulic relationship between personal and social identities. That is, the increases in the salience and influence of one identity diminishes the salience and influence of the other. One important implication of this assumption is that as the group identity becomes salient and apt to guide behavior, the personal identity becomes less salient and less likely to guide behavior. In contrast, the theory of identity fusion theory proposes that both the personal and social identities of a person can be salient and influential simultaneously.|$|E
500|$|Regarding {{the society}} itself, <b>like</b> <b>social</b> {{institutions}} in general, Durkheim {{saw it as}} a set of social facts. Even more than [...] "what society is", Durkheim was interested in answering [...] "how is a society created" [...] and [...] "what holds a society together". In The Division of Labour in Society, Durkheim attempted to answer the question of what holds the society together. He assumes that humans are inherently egoistic, but norms, beliefs and values (collective consciousness) form the moral basis of the society, resulting in social integration. Collective consciousness is of key importance to the society, its requisite function without which the society cannot survive. Collective consciousness produces the society and holds it together, {{and at the same time}} individuals produce collective consciousness through their interactions. Through collective consciousness human beings become aware of one another as social beings, not just animals.|$|E

[...] Allmusic writer Heather Phares has argued that Iyall's [...] "teasing, existential musings [...] predated and predicted the aloof yet frank sexuality of early- and mid-'90s artists such as Elastica and Liz Phair". Phares concluded that the song was [...] "a subversive, influential classic" [...] and [...] "one of new wave's most distinctive and innovative moments. [...] " [...] The song has been covered by many artists, among them are Queens of the Stone Age and Amanda Blank. The song [...] "A Girl in Trouble (Is a Temporary Thing)", their highest-charting single, was reportedly written {{as a response to}} Michael Jackson's hit song [...] "Billie Jean", but can also be seen as a tribute to women who have experienced traumatizing events. Iyall also wrote songs that touched on themes <b>like</b> <b>social</b> alienation ("Undercover Kept") and generation gaps ("Chinatown").|$|E

Geiger also expressed doubts that a swifter response by the government would have stemmed the spread of AIDS as quickly as Shilts was implying. Woodrow Myers from the Los Angeles Times was frustrated by Shilts not asking the right questions: [...] "Shilts fails to probe the broader questions and stops where far {{too many of us}} stop: We don't ask why the Department of Defense and the entitlements <b>like</b> <b>Social</b> Security are getting all the money when the homosexuals and the IV drug abusers with AIDS and the multiple sclerosis patients are not." [...] The Gay Community News in Boston also criticized the book's implications that a diagnosis of HIV indicated that death was sure and imminent.

Though GameSpots Alexa Ray Corriea said that the fetch quests interfered with its emotional quality, the episode built up to a [...] "killer cliffhanger" [...] according to Farokhmanesh. GameZones Matt Liebl said Episode 4: Dark Room was [...] "easily the most emotional episode" [...] and that the mystery of Rachel Amber had done a [...] "tremendous job in keeping us hooked". Tom Hoggins of The Telegraph said the developer's venture into subjects <b>like</b> <b>social</b> division, online bullying, parental conflict and suicide as [...] "bold". Critics said there were tonal problems, caused by the game's [...] "cheap ways" [...] of progressing the plot, such as character inconsistency and superfluous shocks. Critics were more favorable towards the episode's puzzles and relationships. They said the final episode, Polarized, had a [...] "fitting conclusion" [...] to the coming of age story of Max Caulfield {{and the relationship between}} the two leads was carried out successfully. One stealth sequence was described as [...] "tedious" [...] and [...] "out-of-place" [...] while other aspects inhabiting the same course of events were favoured. Reviewers were essentially divided on the ending, citing the episode's subtitle as something that mirrored their own feelings toward it.|$|E

2500|$|Health of {{poor women}} is {{impacted}} by gender inequalities through discriminating distribution of household goods, domestic violence, lack of agency, and unfair distribution of work, leisure, and opportunities between each gender. The {{way in which}} resources such as income, nourishment, and emotional support are traded in the household influences women's psychosocial health, nutrition, wellness, access to healthcare services, and threat of violence. The exchange of these elements in a home mediates in the impacts of geographical, cultural, and household patterns that result in inequality in health status and outcomes. [...] Health-related behaviors, access and use of healthcare, stress, and psychosocial resources <b>like</b> <b>social</b> ties, coping, and spirituality all serve as factors that mediate health inequality. Household discrimination causes missing girls at birth, and the persistence of discrimination and poor service delivery perpetuates high female mortality.|$|E

2500|$|Semiotics is {{the study}} of sign {{processes}} (semiosis), or signification and communication, signs, and symbols, both individually and grouped into sign systems, including the study of how meaning is constructed and understood. Semioticians often do not restrict themselves to linguistic communication when studying the use of signs but extend the meaning of [...] "sign" [...] to cover all kinds of cultural symbols. Nonetheless, semiotic disciplines closely related to linguistics are literary studies, discourse analysis, text linguistics, and philosophy of language. Semiotics, within the linguistics paradigm, {{is the study}} of the relationship between language and culture. Historically, Edward Sapir and Ferdinand De Saussure's structuralist theories influenced the study of signs extensively until the late part of the 20th century, but later, post-modern and post-structural thought, through language philosophers including Jacques Derrida, Mikhail Bakhtin, Michel Foucault, and others, have also been a considerable influence on the discipline in the late part of the 20th century and early 21st century. These theories emphasize the role of language variation, and the idea of subjective usage, depending on external elements <b>like</b> <b>social</b> and cultural factors, rather than merely on the interplay of formal elements.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, {{natural law}} {{refers to the}} use of reason to analyze human nature to deduce binding rules of moral {{behavior}} from nature's or God's creation of reality and mankind. The concept of natural law was first documented in ancient Greek philosophy, including Aristotle, and was referred to in Roman philosophy by Cicero. It was then alluded to in the Bible, from which it was subsequently developed in the Middle Ages by Catholic philosophers such as Albert the Great, and Thomas Aquinas. In the Renaissance, notably the School of Salamanca further contributed. During the Age of Enlightenment, modern era natural law theories were further developed, combining inspiration from Roman law, and alongside philosophies <b>like</b> <b>social</b> contract theory. It featured greatly in the works of Alberico Gentili, Francisco SuÃ¡rez, Richard Hooker, Thomas Hobbes, Hugo Grotius, Samuel von Pufendorf, Matthew Hale, John Locke, Francis Hutcheson, Jean Jacques Burlamaqui, [...] Emmerich de Vattel, Cesare Beccaria and Francesco Mario Pagano. It was used to challenge the divine right of kings, and became an alternative justification {{for the establishment of a}} social contract, positive law, and government â and thus legal rights â in the form of classical republicanism. Conversely, the concept of natural rights is used by others to challenge the legitimacy of all such establishments.|$|E
