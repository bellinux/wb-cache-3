2500|$|When Baron Walter died in 1198, Fitzwalter succeeded to his estates, being already {{more than}} of full age and {{married to his}} first wife, Gunnor. His {{marriage}} to Gunnor had brought him 30½ knight's fees, and he inherited more than 66 from his father. He also acquired two knight's fees through Gunnor's uncle Geoffry of Valognes, and about 1204 obtained <b>livery</b> <b>of</b> <b>seisin</b> of the lands of his own uncle, Godfrey de Luci, bishop of Winchester. Francisque Xavier Michel said that Fitzwalter came to be [...] "one of the greatest men in England, {{and one of the}} most powerful". His lands were mainly situated in the north, so that his interests now became close to those of a faction called the [...] "Aquilonares", whom he would later lead in the struggle against King John.|$|E

50|$|Mr Nicolson claimed {{possession}} of the island, and other lands, these having originally been 'acquired from the family of Mowat Keith' and by right <b>of</b> <b>seisin</b> in 1739. The root of the issue {{appears to be the}} renunciation of the lands by Sir George's father, John Mowat Keith, as a result of debts to John Scott.|$|R
50|$|Upon Martha Custis's {{marriage}} to George Washington in 1759, her dower share came under his control, {{pursuant to the}} common law doctrine <b>of</b> <b>seisin</b> jure uxoris.

John Parke Custis was the only child to reach his majority, upon which he inherited the non-dower two-thirds of his father's estate.|$|R

The Thuringians thought they had made a good deal until the Saxons claimed the entire country on the basis that the dirt had been a <b>livery</b> <b>of</b> <b>seisin,</b> and made their legal claim good by force of arms.|$|E
5000|$|Under the charter, the manors of the earldom {{passed to}} the duchy. The {{original}} 17 manors, all in Cornwall, are known as the antiqua maneria. Those outside Cornwall given to the duchy at its creation are known as the forinseca maneria (foreign manors), with estates incorporated later becoming known as the annexata maneria. The first duke ordered a survey called [...] "The Caption <b>of</b> <b>Seisin</b> <b>of</b> the Duchy of Cornwall" [...] in May 1337 {{to determine the extent}} of duchy holdings of Cornish land including manors, castles and knights' fees, profits from the Stannary courts and shrievalty of Cornwall, and other revenues.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Livery</b> <b>of</b> <b>seisin</b> is an archaic legal {{conveyancing}} ceremony, formerly {{practiced in}} feudal England {{and in other}} countries following English common law, used to convey holdings in property. The term [...] "livery" [...] is related to, if not synonymous with, the word [...] "delivery" [...] as used in modern contract law. The common law in those jurisdictions once provided that a valid conveyance of a feudal tenure in land required the physical transfer by the transferor to the transferee, {{in the presence of}} witnesses, of a piece of the ground itself, in the literal sense of a hand-to-hand passing of an amount of soil, a twig, key, or other symbol.|$|E

In 1341 Margaret died and <b>livery</b> <b>of</b> <b>seisin</b> was granted to Humphrey de Bohun, 6th Earl of Hereford.

5000|$|A deed (anciently [...] "an evidence") is {{any legal}} {{instrument}} in writing which passes, affirms or confirms an interest, right, or property and that is signed, attested, delivered, and in some jurisdictions, sealed. It is commonly associated with transferring (conveyancing) title to property. The deed has a greater presumption of validity and is less rebuttable than an instrument signed by the party to the deed. A deed can be unilateral or bilateral. Deeds include conveyances, commissions, licenses, patents, diplomas, and conditionally powers of attorney if executed as deeds. The deed is the modern descendant of the medieval charter, and delivery is thought to symbolically replace the ancient ceremony of <b>livery</b> <b>of</b> <b>seisin.</b>|$|E
50|$|By the 13th century—in England {{and on the}} continent—the gage {{was limited}} to a term of years and {{contained}} a forfeiture proviso (pactum commissorium) providing that if after the term the debt was not repaid, title was forfeited to the lender, i.e., the term of years would expand automatically into a fee simple. This {{is known as a}} shifting fee and was sufficient after 1199 to entitle the gagee to bring an action for recovery. However, the royal courts increasingly did not respect shifting fees since there was no <b>livery</b> <b>of</b> <b>seisin</b> (i.e., no formal conveyance), nor did they recognize that tenure could be enlarged, so by the 14th century the simple gage for years was invalid in England (and Scotland and the near continent).|$|E
5000|$|In 1664, the English {{seized the}} entire New Netherland colony in the Second Anglo-Dutch War {{and changed the}} name of the town to [...] "New Castle." [...] The Dutch regained the town in 1673 during the Third Anglo-Dutch War but it was {{returned}} to Great Britain the next year under the Treaty of Westminster. In 1680, New Castle was conveyed to William Penn by the Duke of York by <b>livery</b> <b>of</b> <b>seisin</b> and was Penn's landing place when he first set foot on American soil on October 27, 1682. This transfer to Penn was contested by Lord Baltimore and the boundary dispute was not resolved until the survey conducted by Mason and Dixon, now famed in history as the Mason-Dixon line.|$|E

A cannot be forced to accept Os after-acquired title if she wishes instead to receive damages.|$|R
5000|$|The {{types of}} deeds {{that are now}} used to {{transfer}} real property are a relatively modern invention. Previously, the grantor transferred the property to the buyer, called the [...] "grantee", by performing some commonly recognized deed, such as picking {{up a handful of}} soil of the property to be transferred, handing it to the buyer, and reciting legally prescribed words that acknowledged the transfer in the presence of witnesses. This was called <b>livery</b> <b>of</b> <b>seisin.</b> Over time, and particularly with the development of modern technology that permits government offices to keep accurate copies of documents, the physical deed that was formerly performed in order to transfer a property was replaced by the paper deed, also known as a deed poll, that is now commonly used.|$|E
50|$|In September 1512 the Master and Wardens of the Merchant Taylors {{received}} a Mortmain licence by Letters Patent, to acquire possessions worth £20 {{a year to}} support a Master and Usher (i.e. second master) in the grammar school 'to teach boys literature and good behaviour' which Jenyns intended to erect and found in Wolverhampton. Pursuant to this, in April 1513 Jenyns was granted similar licence to alienate the manor of Rushock, Worcestershire, near Chaddesley Corbett, worth £14 a year, to them for that purpose. John Nechylls {{was one of the}} attorneys appointed in May 1515 by Jenyns to grant <b>livery</b> <b>of</b> <b>seisin</b> of the manor to the Merchant Taylors, which was completed in June following. By this time the school had presumably been built. Nechylls later gave 20 shillings a year towards the Usher's wages.|$|E
5000|$|When an English tenant-in-chief died, an inquisition {{post mortem}} {{was held in}} each county in which he held land {{and his or her}} land {{temporarily}} escheated (i.e.reverted) to the demesne of the crown until the heir paid a sum of money (a relief), and was then able to take possession (<b>livery</b> <b>of</b> <b>seisin)</b> of the lands. However, if the heir was underage (under 21 for a male heir, under 14 for an heiress) they would be subject to a feudal wardship where the custody of their lands and the right to arrange their marriage passed to the monarch, until they came of age. The wardship and marriage was not usually kept in Crown hands, but was sold, often simply to the highest bidder, unless outbid by the next of kin.|$|E

50|$|Seisin is now {{confined}} to {{possession of the}} freehold, though at one time {{it appears to have}} been used for simple possession without regard to the estate of the possessor. Its importance is considerably less than it was at one time, owing to the old form of conveyance by feoffment with <b>livery</b> <b>of</b> <b>seisin</b> having been superseded by a deed of grant, and the old rule of descent from the person last seised having been abolished in favour of descent from the purchaser. Lord Denning controversially supported the abolition of the concept of seisin, however the common law has since decided to maintain the concept of seisin. At one time the right of the wife to dower and of the husband to an estate by curtesy depended upon the doctrine of seisin. The Dower Act (1833-1834), however, rendered the fact of the seisin of the husband of no importance, and the Married Women's Property Act 1882 practically abolished the old law of curtesy.|$|E
5000|$|Deeds {{of trust}} differ from {{mortgages}} in that deeds of trust always involve {{at least three}} parties, where the third party holds the legal title, while {{in the context of}} mortgages, the mortgagor gives legal title directly to the mortgagee. [...] In either case, equitable title remains with the borrower. Both mortgages and deeds of trust are essentially security instruments in the form of conveyances; that is, they appear to provide on their face for absolute conveyances of legal title, but it is implicitly understood that the borrower is retaining equitable title and the conveyance is intended to merely create a security interest. This confusing situation is a legacy of the archaic (and now-obsolete) common law requirement of <b>livery</b> <b>of</b> <b>seisin,</b> under which English common law courts had refused to enforce shifting fees or springing freehold interests (that is, a gage for years that was supposed to automatically expand to fee simple title if the underlying debt was not repaid).|$|E
