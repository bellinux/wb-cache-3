5000|$|The Etmopteridae are {{a family}} of sharks in the order Squaliformes, {{commonly}} known as <b>lantern</b> <b>sharks.</b> Their name comes from the presence of light-producing photophores on their bodies. The members of this family are small, under 90 cm long, and are found in deep waters worldwide. The 45 species are placed in five genera. Three-quarters of the species are in the genus Etmopterus.|$|E

50|$|While {{these tools}} may be {{effective}} as predator avoidance mechanisms, they {{also serve as}} equally effective tools for the predators themselves. For example, the deepwater velvet belly <b>lantern</b> <b>shark</b> uses counter-illumination to hide from its prey.|$|R
40|$|Bioluminescence is {{a common}} feature in the {{permanent}} darkness of the deep-sea. In fishes, light is emitted by organs containing either photogenic cells (intrinsic photophores), which are under direct nervous control, or symbiotic luminous bacteria (symbiotic photophores), whose light is controlled by secondary means such as mechanical occlusion or physiological suppression. The intrinsic photophores of the <b>lantern</b> <b>shark</b> Etmopterus spinax were recently shown as an exception to this rule since {{they appear to be}} under hormonal control. Here, we show that hormones operate what amounts to a unique light switch, by acting on a chromatophore iris, which regulates light emission by pigment translocation. This result strongly suggests that this shark's luminescence control originates from the mechanism for physiological colour change found in shallow water sharks that also involves hormonally controlled chromatophores: the <b>lantern</b> <b>shark</b> would have turned the initial shallow water crypsis mechanism into a midwater luminous camouflage, more efficient in the deep-sea environment...|$|R
50|$|Besides its {{effectiveness}} as a predator avoidance mechanism, counter-illumination {{also serves as}} an essential tool to predators themselves.

Age was estimated from sections of the second dorsal spine and validated by marginal increment analysis. Males attained a maximum age of 13 years, while 17 -year-old females were found. Several growth models were fitted and compared for both size and weight at age data, showing that even though this is a small sized species, it has a relatively slow growth rate. This species matures late and at a relatively large size: at 86. 81 % and 79. 40 % of the maximum observed sizes and at 58. 02 % and 54. 40 % of the maximum observed ages for males and females, respectively. It has a low fecundity, with a mean ovarian fecundity of 10. 44 oocytes per reproductive cycle. The estimated parameters indicate that this species has a vulnerable life cycle, typical of deep water squalid sharks.

40|$|The shark genus Etmopterus {{encompasses}} numerous {{deep-sea species}} that are widely distributed throughout the world's oceans and share the capability to emit light thanks to numerous tiny epidermal photogenic organs called photophores. Despite the potential wide ecological interest of this light emission, {{it is still a}} poorly studied aspect of shark biology, mostly due to the challenges inherent to the study of uncommon deep-sea animals. During a collection trip in waters around Okinawa Island, we had the opportunity to collect, maintain and study specimens of Etmopterus splendidus, a small pelagic <b>lantern</b> <b>shark</b> that was not previously known from this area. Analyses show that (i) the photophore density of this species varies according to the different parts of the body, which led to a heterogeneous photogenic pattern; (ii) photophore harbour the classical structure found in other etmopterid sharks, i. e. a cluster of photocytes enclosed in a pigmented sheath and surmounted by pigmented and lens cells; (iii) the physiological control of these photophores appears similar to what was found in the distantly related Etmopterus spinax, i. e. including hormonal and neural inputs as well as the action of pigmented cells overlying the photocytes.

40|$|SummaryIn his {{monograph}} on Cirripedia from 1851 [1], Darwin {{pointed to}} a highly unusual, plateless, and most likely parasitic barnacle of uncertain phylogenetic affinity. Darwin’s barnacle was Anelasma squalicola, found on deep-water sharks of the family Etmopteridae, or <b>lantern</b> <b>sharks</b> [2]. The barnacle is uncommon and is therefore rarely studied. Recent observations by us have shown that they occur at an unusually high prevalence on the velvet belly lantern shark, Etmopterus spinax, in restricted fjord areas of western Norway. A phylogenetic analysis based on ribosomal DNA data (16 S, 18 S, and 28 S) from 99 selected barnacle species, including all available pedunculate barnacle sequences from GenBank, shows that A.  squalicola is most closely related (sister taxon) to the pedunculate barnacle Capitulum mitella. Both C.  mitella and species of Pollicipes, situated one node higher in the tree, are conventional suspension feeders from the rocky intertidal. Our phylogenetic analysis now {{makes it possible to}} establish morphological homologies between A.  squalicola and its sister taxon and provides the evolutionary framework to explain the unprecedented transition from a filter-feeding barnacle to a parasitic mode of life...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lantern</b> <b>sharks</b> {{are small}} deep-sea sharks that harbour complex species-specific {{luminescent}} photophore patterns. The luminescent pattern {{of one of}} these sharks, Etmopterus spinax, is made up of nine luminous zones. Previous experiments revealed that in the largest of these zones (ventral zone), photophores are under hormonal control, light being triggered by both melatonin (MT) and prolactin (PRL). In this study, we analysed the luminescent responses to MT and PRL in five other luminous zones from 12 female and eight male E. spinax specimens. The results showed that all luminous zones respond to both hormones, with each zone having its own kinetic parameters (maximum light intensity, L max; total light emitted, L tot; time from stimulation to L max, TL max), which confirms the multifunctional character of this shark's luminescence. L tot and L max were found to be directly dependent on the photophore density (P D) of the luminous zone, while TL max varied independently from P D. In addition, we demonstrate a sexual dimorphism in the luminescent response to PRL, with male specimens having smaller L tot and TL max in the luminous zones from the pelvic region. As this region also harbours the sexual organs of this species, this strongly suggests a role for the luminescence from these zones in reproduction...|$|E

40|$|Anelasma squalicola is a {{recently}} evolved parasite. Very {{little is known}} of its biology due to its normally low prevalence in deep sea <b>lantern</b> <b>sharks</b> (family: Etmopteridae), {{in which it is}} found embedded in the skin. A population of more heavily infected sharks (Etmopterus spinax) in Lusterfjord, Norway, has allowed for sampling by trawl, and subsequent observations and measurements of the parasite and host. The study shows that E. spinax has a heterogeneous population structure and potentially narrow home range, which likely affects prevalence and dispersal of A. squalicola. A. squalicola appears capable of infecting hosts regardless of size. It has high site specificity, which may be due to areas of the shark where the skin is easier to penetrate. It is most commonly found in pairs, which gives it an atypical intensity distribution. The data suggests the first individual to settle can attract partners to the same site, but this attraction does not result in more infections at other sites on the host. Attracting more than one partner appears to severely reduce their fecundity, which may imply a crowding effect. Infection did not affect liver mass or condition of hosts, but appears to prevent maturation in males. This study provides the most extensive parasitological description of A. squalicola to date, and reveals both a complex host population as well as a highly distinctive infection behaviour, which combined shape this parasite- host interaction...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundSqualiform sharks {{represent}} approximately 27 % of extant shark diversity, comprising {{more than}} 130 species with a predominantly deep-dwelling lifestyle. Many Squaliform species are highly specialized, including {{some that are}} bioluminescent, a character that is reported exclusively from Squaliform sharks within Chondrichthyes. The interfamiliar relationships within the order are still not satisfactorily resolved. Herein we estimate the phylogenetic interrelationships of a generic level sampling of “squaloid” sharks and closely related taxa using aligned sequences derived from a targeted gene capture approach. The resulting phylogenetic estimate is further {{used to evaluate the}} age of first occurrence of bioluminescence in Squaliformes. ResultsOur dataset comprised 172 putative ortholog exon sequences. Phylogenetic estimates result in a fully resolved tree supporting a monophyletic lineage of Squaliformes excluding Echinorhinus. Non-luminous Squalidae are inferred to be the sister to a clade comprising all remaining Squaliform families. Our results suggest that the origin of photophores is coincident with an elevated diversification rate and the splitting of families Dalatiidae, Etmopteridae, Oxynotidae and Somniosidae at the transition of the Lower to the Upper Cretaceous. The presence of luminous organs was confirmed for the Sleeper shark genus Zameus. These results indicate that bioluminescence in sharks is not restricted solely to the families Etmopteridae and Dalatiidae as previously believed. ConclusionsThe sister-clade to non-luminous Squalidae comprises five families. The presence of photophores is reported for extant members of three out of these five families based on results of this study, i. e. <b>Lantern</b> <b>sharks</b> (Etmopteridae), Kitefin sharks (Dalatiidae) and Sleeper sharks (Somniosidae). Our results suggest that the origin of luminous organs arose during the rapid diversification event that gave rise to the extant Squaliform families. These inferences are consistent with the idea of diversification of Squaliform sharks being associated with the emergence of new deep-sea habitats in the Lower Cretaceous, which may have been facilitated by the evolution of bioluminescence...|$|E

Trawls generally caught smaller-sized specimens, in a wider length range than longlines. Trawls caught mostly immature specimens of all species, namely 83. 7 % immature of E. pusillus, 84. 3 % of E. spinax, 89. 5 % of G. melastomus, and 95. 5 % of G. atlanticus, while longlines caught mostly immature E. pusillus (69. 2 %) and G. melastomus (78. 6 %) and mostly mature E. spinax (88. 2 %) and G. atlanticus (87. 2 %). Trawls tended to catch more males than females of all species except E. spinax, while longlines caught more females than males of E. spinax and G. melastomus and more males than females of the other two species. The main conclusion of this work is that trawls are catching smaller-sized and mostly immature specimens when compared to longlines, meaning that they are probably having a more detrimental effect on these shark populations. The data presented here have significant implications for the conservation of these shark populations since sizes, sexes, and the immature and mature components of the populations are being affected differently by these two fishing gears...|$|E

40|$|Photogenic organs (photophores) of {{the velvet}} belly <b>lantern</b> <b>shark</b> (Etmopterus spinax) are under {{hormonal}} control, since melatonin (MT) and prolactin (PRL) trigger luminescence while α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) prevents this light to be emitted.

In addition, we also demonstrated that BICU can induce light per se by provoking pigment retraction in the pigmented cells composing the iris-like structure of the photophore, attaining, however, only about 10 % of hormonally induced luminescence intensity at 10 (- 3) molL(- 1).

In this study, 67 research cruise bottom trawl tows (with 1 -hour duration) were carried out at depths that ranged from 84 to 786 m.

These zones form the complex luminous pattern observed in free-swimming animals. The organogenesis of photophores (photogenic organs) from the different luminous zones was followed, and photophore maturation was marked {{by the appearance of}} green fluorescent vesicles inside the photocytes (photogenic cells). Peroxide-induced light emissions as well as spontaneous luminescence analysis indicated that the ability of E. spinax to produce light was linked to the presence of these fluorescent vesicles and occured prior to birth. The size of photogenic organs, as well as the percentage of ventral body surface area occupied by the luminous pattern and covered by photophores increased sharply during embryogenesis but remained relatively stable in free-swimming animals. All these results strongly suggest camouflage by counter-illumination in juvenile E. spinax. (C) 2008 The Authors Journal compilation (C) 2008 The Fisheries Society of the British Isle...|$|R
40|$|Photophores (photogenic organs) of the <b>lantern</b> <b>shark</b> Etmopterus spinax {{are under}} {{hormonal}} control, with prolactin (PRL) and melatonin (MT) triggering the light emission. Differential sensitivity to these hormones in adult individuals suggests, however, that the luminescence of this shark {{is controlled by}} an additional mechanism. In this study, different techniques were used to investigate a potential modulator of E. spinax luminescence – nitric oxide (NO). NO synthase (NOS) -like immunoreactivity (IR) {{was found in the}} photocytes (photogenic cells) of the photophores. In addition, acetylated tubulin IR also supported the presence of nerves running through the photogenic tissue and innervating different structural elements of the photophores: photocytes, pigmented cells from the iris-like structure and lens cells. Pharmacological experiments confirmed a modulatory action of NO on the hormonally induced luminescence: NO donors sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and hydroxylamine decreased the time to reach the maximum amplitude (TL max) of MT-induced luminescence while these substances decreased the maximum amplitude of PRL-induced luminescence (and also the TL max in the case of SNP). The small impact of the NOS inhibitor l-NAME on hormonally induced luminescence suggests that NO is only produced on demand. The cGMP analogue 8 BrcGMP mimicked the effects of NO donors suggesting that the effects of NO are mediated by cGMP...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemistry}} of the luminous {{system in a}} shark is addressed for the first time. Assuming that many luminous species acquire their luminous substrate (luciferin) through the food chain, we investigated the feeding habits of a Norwegian population of the <b>lantern</b> <b>shark</b> Etmopterus spinax Linnaeus, 1758 {{in order to identify}} potential alimentary sources of luciferin in this species. Among the major groups of preys found in the diet of E. spinax, we identified three potential sources of luciferin: the euphausiid Meganyctiphanes norvegica Sars, 1857 (tetrapyrrole luciferin), the shrimp Pasiphaea multidentata Esmark, 1866 (coelenterazine) and the teleost Maurolicus muelleri Gmelin, 1789 (coelenterazine). Their luciferins were tested for their presence in the digestive tract and photogenic organs of E. spinax as well as for their cross-reaction with a putative shark catalyst. Although not detected in the diet, the cypridinid luciferin, the third most widespread marine luciferin, was also assayed. As a result, only the coelenterazine was unambiguously detected in the digestive tract of E. spinax and none of the tested luciferins reacted with the shark catalyst extract. Our results support the hypothesis of an unknown luminous system in this shark species, involving either a known luciferin in a specific active or storage form, or an unknown light- emitting molecule...|$|R
