500|$|Crisis Core uses a slot machine-like {{mechanic}} {{to affect}} the combat system. The [...] "Digital Mind Wave" [...] (DMW) features two sets of three spinning wheels; one set with the numbers one through seven, and another with pictures of characters that Zack befriends during the game. The DMW automatically spins as long as Zack has at least 10 [...] "Soldier Points", which are awarded to the player by defeating foes. If the DMW stops with the same three pictures lined up, Zack will then perform an appropriate Limit Break attack that can greatly harm an enemy or significantly heal Zack. Additionally, in this case, if the number slots give {{two or more of}} the same number, the materia in that slot will power up. Should the numbers line up as [...] "777", Zack will gain an experience level, increasing his health, soldier points, and ability points. If there is no match in the pictures, matching numbers on the slots will grant temporary bonuses, such as limited invincibility or zero-cost use of skills and abilities. The chance of matching pictures is tied to the current <b>Limit</b> <b>level,</b> which is raised by taking damage in battle and reduced upon successful battles, and after certain storyline events. After collecting certain items in the game, the pictures on the DMW may also randomly change to summonable creatures, which have more destructive and beneficial Limit Breaks should the pictures match up.|$|E

This implies that, even when energy-level distributions of individual components are statistically independent, non-Poissonian level spacing distributions are possible. Comment: 19 pages, 4 figures.

40|$|Even {{though many}} {{studies have shown that}} {{radioactive}} caesium levels in fish caught outside of Japan were below experimental detection limits of a few Bq kg 21, significant public concern has been expressed about the safety of consuming seafood from the Pacific Ocean following the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear accident. To address the public concerns, samples of commonly con-sumed salmon and groundfish harvested from the Canadian west coast in 2013 were analysed for radioactive caesium. None of the fish samples analysed in this study contained any detectable levels of 134 Cs and 137 Cs under given experimental setting with the average detection limit of ∼ 2 Bq kg 21. Using a conservative worst-case scenario where all fish samples would contain 137 Cs exactly at the detection <b>limit</b> <b>level</b> and 134 Cs at half of the detection <b>limit</b> <b>level</b> (to account for much shorter half-life of 134 Cs), the resulting radiation dose for people from consumption of this fish would be a very small fraction of the annual dose from expos-ure to natural background radiation in Canada. Therefore, fish, such as salmon and groundfish, from the Canadian west coast are of no radiological health concern...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discussed}} {{an active}} power generator scheduling {{in order to}} increase the <b>limit</b> <b>level</b> of steady state systems especially in the peak load condition. Some power generator optimization methods such as those of Langrange, Genetic Algorithm (GA), NN-GA, Merit Order, and the proposed Z-Thevenin-based were studied and compared in respect of their steady state aspects. A method proposed in this paper was a developed one based on the Thevenin equivalent impedance values between each load respected to each generator. These impedance values represented the point-to-point electric distance between a specific load and a related generator. Power generators with the closest impedance to the load were operated at the maximum level, followed by other generators. In this research, REI-Dimo was used to determine the steady state stability limit (SSSL). The steady state stability index values obtained through the various generator scheduling methods have been compared with the proposed method. As a study case, this research reviewed the 500 kV-Jawa-Bali interconnection system. The simulation results showed that the proposed method required the highest operational cost; however, it had the highest <b>limit</b> <b>level</b> of steady state stability compared to other optimization techniques. Thus, the proposed method could be used to create the steady state stability limit of the system especially in the peak load condition...|$|E

40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) are compounds which belong to {{persistent organic pollutants}} group; some of which produce mutagenic and cancerogenic effects. These xenobiotics showed proven, negative effects on health preterm births and low infant birth weight. PAHs penetrate into the human body by three exposure pathways: inhalation, ingestion and skin contact, of which the skin contact pathway is the least important {{in the case of}} environmental exposure. Transport, and industrial and municipal sections are also an important source of these compounds. The level of benzo(a) pyrene (BaP) has been monitored in all the Polish provinces since 2005 in the air. BaP is a determinant of the level of all PAHs’ compounds. Despite of the permanent lowering of the level of BaP in the air since the 90 s, the <b>limit</b> <b>level</b> (1 ng/m 3) has been exceeded in most provinces of the country. In 2010 this situation concerned all Polish agglomerations and the biggest excess has been observed in the province of Silesia in the area of rybnicko-jastrzębska agglomeration. Of sixteen Polish provinces only Lublin and Podlasie provinces did not exceed the <b>limit</b> <b>level,</b> of BaP in the air in 2012. These data shows that a serious health risk may occur due to environmental pollution caused by PAHs compounds.
