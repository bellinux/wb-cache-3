25|$|In seismology, {{several types}} of surface waves are encountered. Surface waves, in this {{mechanical}} sense, {{are commonly known as}} either Love waves (L waves) or Rayleigh waves. A seismic wave is a wave that travels through the Earth, often as the result of an earthquake or explosion. Love waves have transverse motion (movement is perpendicular to the direction of travel, like light waves), whereas Rayleigh waves have both <b>longitudinal</b> (<b>movement</b> parallel to the direction of travel, like sound waves) and transverse motion. Seismic waves are studied by seismologists and measured by a seismograph or seismometer. Surface waves span a wide frequency range, and the period of waves that are most damaging is usually 10 seconds or longer. Surface waves can travel around the globe many times from the largest earthquakes. Surface waves are caused when P waves and S waves come to the surface.|$|E

50|$|The {{structural}} {{system is a}} 603.7 m-long continuous beam with an overall height of 5.0 m. The 17 piers have been preserved. The longitudinal forces, including from braking and accelerating, are transferred to {{the ground at the}} eastern abutment, which forms the new fixed-point of the bridge. Therefore, the abutment was replaced by a new structure built on piles. In the west, the bridge connects with the Rhine bridge. The track has a expansion joint that allows for <b>longitudinal</b> <b>movements</b> of up to 700 mm.|$|R

2500|$|If not restrained, rails would {{lengthen}} in {{hot weather}} and shrink in cold weather. To provide this restraint, the rail is prevented from moving {{in relation to the}} sleeper by use of clips or anchors. Attention needs to be paid to compacting the ballast effectively, including under, between, and at the ends of the sleepers, to prevent the sleepers from moving. Anchors are more common for wooden sleepers, whereas most concrete or steel sleepers are fastened to the rail by special clips that resist <b>longitudinal</b> <b>movement</b> of the rail. There is no theoretical limit to how long a welded rail can be. However, if longitudinal and lateral restraint are insufficient, the track could become distorted {{in hot weather}} and cause a derailment. Distortion due to heat expansion is known in North America as sun kink, and elsewhere as buckling. In extreme hot weather special inspections are required to monitor sections of track known to be problematic. In North American practice extreme temperature conditions will trigger slow orders to allow for crews to react to buckling or [...] "sun kinks" [...] if encountered.|$|E
2500|$|The port handles around 8 {{million tonnes}} of coal for clients {{such as the}} Andhra Pradesh State Electricity Board, Karnataka Power Corporation, cement plants of Tamil Nadu and {{independent}} power producers in northern Tamil Nadu and southern Andhra Pradesh. The coal handling for the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board {{was transferred to the}} Ennore Port. In 2005, as part of pollution-control measure, the port has installed wind curtains made of ultraviolet resistant fabric along the harbour's beachfront for over 1.5km to the east of the coal terminal to prevent wind carrying coal dust into the city at a cost of [...] 3.7 million. In 2008, the port has also installed a semi-mechanised closed coal conveyor system comprising two streams with a capacity of 15 million metric tons/annum and a handling rated capacity of 1,500 metric tons/hour/stream and running for a length of 5km at two berths, namely, Jawahar Dock IV and VI, at a cost of [...] 430 million to transfer the coal to the individual coal plots {{at the southern end of}} the port, from where the cargo will be transported by rail to respective destinations, thus preventing pollution from coal dust and eliminating movement of coal-carrying trucks within the port. The conveyor runs at an elevation of 10â€“13m and has provision for <b>longitudinal</b> <b>movement</b> along the road to the plots and transverse movement for stacking coal at individual plots. Coal discharged into the hoppers located at the two docks is conveyed to coal plots through conveyors or tripper cars and is equipped with belt weigher.

40|$|We {{have used}} a {{high-resolution}} motion analysis system to reinvestigate shape changes in isolated guinea pig cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) evoked by low-frequency (2 - 3 Hz) external electric stimulation. This phenomenon of electromotility is presumed to result from voltage-dependent structural changes in the lateral plasma membrane of the OHC. In addition to well-known <b>longitudinal</b> <b>movements,</b> OHCs were found to display bending movements when the alternating external electric field gradients were oriented perpendicular to the cylindrical cell body. The peak-to-peak amplitude of the bending movement {{was found to be}} as large as 0. 7 microm. The specific sulfhydryl reagents, p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid and p-hydroxymercuriphenylsulfonic acid, that suppress electrically evoked <b>longitudinal</b> OHCs <b>movements,</b> also inhibit the bending movements, indicating that these two movements share the same underlying mechanism. The OHC bending is likely to result from an electrical charge separation that produces depolarization of the lateral plasma membrane {{on one side of the}} cell and hyperpolarization on the other side. In the cochlea, OHC bending could produce radial distortions in the sensory epithelium and influence the micromechanics of the organ of Corti...|$|R

40|$|Two {{different}} methods to measure binocular <b>longitudinal</b> corneal apex <b>movements</b> were synchronously applied. High-speed videokeratoscopy at a sampling frequency of 15 Hz and a customdesigned ultrasound distance sensor at 100 Hz {{were used for}} {{the left and the right}} eye, respectively. Four healthy subjects participated in the study. Simultaneously, cardiac electric cycle (ECG) was registered for each subject at 100 Hz. Each measurement took 20 s. Subjects were asked to suppress blinking during the measurements. A rigid headrest and a bite-bar were used to minimize undesirable head movements. Time, frequency and time-frequency representations of the acquired signals were obtained to establish their temporal and spectral contents. Coherence analysis was used to estimate the correlation between the measured signals. The results showed close correlation between both corneal apex movements and the cardiopulmonary system.

40|$|Jointless bridges {{have been}} in service for more than 50 years. Since no {{expansion}} joint is utilized in these structures, they have longer service life, reduced maintenance and construction costs, improved riding quality, and added redundancy. Because of integrity of the superstructure with the substructure, the thermal movements {{as well as other}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>movements</b> are transferred to substructure. These lateral movements can induce relatively large forces and moments in the substructure elements including the abutment and the piles. Typically, flexible foundations which include single row of piles are preferred in jointless bridges to reduce the stiffness of the system against <b>longitudinal</b> <b>movements</b> of the superstructure. ^ The main objective of this dissertation is to improve and expand the application of jointless bridges to longer bridge lengths. As the imposed movements at the pile head level due to superstructure 2 Ì† 7 s displacements are linearly proportional to the length of the jointless bridge, by increasing the pile head displacement capacity the length of jointless bridges can be expanded. A parametric study has been conducted using nonlinear pushover analysis. The results of this study show that the pile head displacement capacity can be increased up to four times if rotational capacity is provided at the pile-cap connection. Further, it is shown that strong axis bending results in more displacement capacity as compared to weak axis bending, although the lateral stiffness would be smaller in the latter case. Experimental study has been carried out on the proposed connection of CFT piles to the concrete cap. It is shown that this detail can effectively reduce the moment-rotation stiffness of the connection and increase the displacement capacity up to four times. ^ New design procedure is proposed for HP piles supporting jointless bridges. In this approach, only compact sections are recommended in order to prevent local buckling prior to reaching full plastic moment capacity of the cross section. Further, fatigue and strength criteria are combined and displacement capacity is estimated based on the boundary conditions, axial load, soil type, and orientation of the pile. ...|$|R

One end of the strip is fixed to an adjustable cantilever and the other end is fixed to the spring elbow. The spring elbow, in turn, is connected to a plunger, which moves upwards or downwards. The spring elbow, which consists of flexible strips and a stiff diagonal acts as a bell crank lever and causes the twisted strip to change length whenever there is a movement in the plunger. This change in length {{will result in a}} proportional amount of twist of the metallic strip. The magnification can be varied by changing the length of the spring elbow.|$|E

The time-averaged free-surface profile presented some self-similar profile. The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>movements</b> of the jump were observed and both fast and very slow fluctuations were documented for all Froude numbers.
