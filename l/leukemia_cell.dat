25|$|Aberrant Notch {{signaling}} is {{a driver}} of T cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) and is mutated {{in at least}} 65% of all T-ALL cases. Notch signaling can be activated by mutations in Notch itself, inactivating mutations in FBXW7 (a negative regulator of Notch1), or rarely by t(7;9)(q34;q34.3) translocation. In the context of T-ALL, Notch activity cooperates with additional oncogenic lesions such as c-MYC to activate anabolic pathways such as ribosome and protein biosythesis thereby promoting <b>leukemia</b> <b>cell</b> growth.|$|E

40|$|Bruton's {{tyrosine}} kinase (BTK) deficiency {{results in a}} differentiation block at the pre-B cell stage. Likewise, acute lymphoblastic <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells</b> are typically arrested at early stages of B cell development. We therefore investigated BTK function in B <b>cell</b> precursor <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells</b> carrying a BCR-ABL 1, E 2 A-PBX 1, MLL-AF 4, TEL-AML 1, or TEL-PDGFRB gene rearrangement. Although somatic mutations of the BTK gene are rare in B <b>cell</b> precursor <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells,</b> we identified kinase-deficient splice variants of BTK throughout all leukemia subtypes. Unlike infant <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells</b> carrying an MLL-AF 4 gene rearrangement, where expression of full-length BTK was detectable in only four of eight primary cases, in <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells</b> harboring other fusion genes full-length BTK was typically coexpressed with kinase-deficient variants. As shown by overexpression experiments, kinase-deficient splice variants {{can act as a}} dominant-negative BTK in that they suppress BTK-dependent differentiation and pre-B cell receptor responsiveness of the <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells.</b> On the other hand, induced expression of full-length BTK rendered the <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells</b> particularly sensitive to apoptosis. Comparing BTK expression in surviving or preapoptotic <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells</b> after 10 -Gy γ radiation, we observed selective survival of <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells</b> that exhibit expression of dominant-negative BTK forms. These findings indicate that lack of BTK expression or expression of dominant-negative splice variants in B <b>cell</b> precursor <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells</b> can (i) inhibit differentiation beyond the pre-B cell stage and (ii) protect from radiation-induced apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|To improve cancer immunotherapy, it is {{important}} to understand how tumor cells counteract immune-surveillance. In this study, we sought to identify cell-surface molecules associated with resistance of <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells</b> to cytotoxic T cell (CTL) -mediated cytolysis. To this end, we first established thousands of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that react with MLL/AF 9 mouse <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells.</b> Only two of these mAbs, designated R 54 and B 2, bound preferentially to <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells</b> resistant to cytolysis by a tumor cell antigen-specific CTLs. The antigens recognized by these mAbs were identified by expression cloning as the same protein, CD 43, although their binding patterns to subsets of hematopoietic cells differed significantly from each other and from a pre-existing pan-CD 43 mAb, S 11. The epitopes of R 54 and B 2, but not S 11, were sialidase-sensitive and expressed at various levels on <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells,</b> suggesting that binding of R 54 or B 2 is associated with the glycosylation status of CD 43. R 54 high <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells,</b> which are likely to express sialic acid-rich CD 43, were highly resistant to CTL-mediated cytolysis. In addition, loss of CD 43 in <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells</b> or neuraminidase treatment of <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells</b> sensitized <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells</b> to CTL-mediated cell lysis. These results suggest that sialic acid-rich CD 43, which harbors multiple sialic acid residues that impart a net negative surface charge, protects <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells</b> from CTL-mediated cell lysis. Furthermore, R 54 high or B 2 high <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells</b> preferentially survived in vivo in the presence of adaptive immunity. Taken together, these results suggest that the glycosylation status of CD 43 on leukemia is associated with sensitivity to CTL-mediated cytolysis in vitro and in vivo. Thus, regulation of CD 43 glycosylation is a potential strategy for enhancing CTL-mediated immunotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Pre-B lymphoblastic <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells</b> {{carrying}} a BCR-ABL 1 gene rearrangement exhibit an undifferentiated phenotype. Comparing the genome-wide gene expression profiles of normal B-cell subsets and BCR-ABL 1 + pre-B lymphoblastic <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells</b> by SAGE, the <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells</b> show loss of B lymphoid identity and aberrant expression of myeloid lineage-specific molecules. Consistent with this, BCR-ABL 1 + pre-B lymphoblastic <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells</b> exhibit defective expression of IKAROS, a transcription factor needed for early lymphoid lineage commitment. As shown by inducible expression of BCR-ABL 1 in human and murine B-cell precursor cell lines, BCR-ABL 1 induces {{the expression of}} a dominant-negative IKAROS splice variant, termed IK 6. Comparing matched leukemia sample pairs from patients before and during therapy with the BCR-ABL 1 kinase inhibitor STI 571 (Imatinib), inhibition of BCR-ABL 1 partially corrected aberrant expression of IK 6 and lineage infidelity of the <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells.</b> To elucidate the contribution of IK 6 to lineage infidelity in BCR-ABL 1 + cell lines, IK 6 expression was silenced by RNA interference. Upon inhibition of IK 6, BCR-ABL 1 + <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells</b> partially restored B lymphoid lineage commitment. Therefore, we propose that BCR-ABL 1 induces aberrant splicing of IKAROS, which interferes with lineage identity and differentiation of pre-B lymphoblastic <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
25|$|In vivo anti-tumor {{activity}} of thalidomide {{is believed to}} be due to the potent anti-angiogenic effect and also through changes in cytokine expression. In vitro assays on apoptosis in MM cells have been shown, when treated with thalidomide and its analogs, to upregulate the {{activity of}} caspase-8. This causes cross talking of apoptotic signaling between caspase-8 and caspase-9 leading to indirect upregulation of caspase-9 activity. Further anti-tumor activity is mediated through the inhibition of apoptosis protein-2 and pro-survival effects of IGF-1, increasing sensitivity to FAS mediated cell death and enhancement of TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand. They have also been shown to cause dose dependent G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in <b>leukemia</b> <b>cell</b> lines where the analogs showed 100 times more potency than thalidomide.|$|E

40|$|In acute {{myeloid leukemia}} (AML), the chances of {{achieving}} disease-free survival are low. Studies have demonstrated a supportive role of endothelial cells (ECs) in normal hematopoiesis. Here we show that similar intercellular relationships exist in leukemia. We demonstrate that <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells</b> themselves initiate these interactions by directly modulating the behavior of resting ECs through the induction of EC activation. In this inflammatory state, activated ECs induce the adhesion of a sub-set of <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells</b> through the cell adhesion molecule E-selectin. These adherent <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells</b> are sequestered in a quiescent state and are unaffected by chemotherapy. The ability of adherent cells to later detach and again become proliferative following exposure to chemotherapy suggests a role of this process in relapse. Interestingly, differing leukemia subtypes modulate this process to varying degrees, which may explain the varied response of AML patients to chemotherapy and relapse rates. Finally, because <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells</b> themselves induce EC activation, we postulate a positive-feedback loop in leukemia that exists to support the growth and relapse of the disease.
