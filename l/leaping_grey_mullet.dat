40|$|A {{population}} of <b>leaping</b> <b>grey</b> <b>mullet</b> (Liza saliens (Risso, 1810) was studied {{in order to}} measure seasonal and annual growth rates. The annual growth rates were similar to those reported for other populations from the central Western Mediterranean and intermediate between those living in northern and southern areas. As usual, the growth rate of adult males was slower than that of females. Males reached adulthood in their third summer. Females of the same age showed a moderate gonadal development, but did not ripen until the next summer. Mullets of all ages gained weight only when the water temperature was higher than 20 °C. However adults and immature fish showed reduced growth in mid-summer, when that of the juveniles peaked. This difference is not a consequence of the reproductive cost, because the growth rate of immatures was greatly reduced although they did not spawn...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} the first {{detailed}} work on the age and growth of the leaping mullet (Liza saliens, Risso 1810) in the central Mediterranean. During the period 1991 - 1995 the age and growth of leaping mullet from the Messolonghi -Etoliko lagoon system (western Greek coast) were studied. Age and growth determinations were based upon otolith samples taken from 537 fish. Marginal increment {{analysis was used to}} validate age determination. Annulus formation took place around November each year. The back-calculated lengths at age estimated from the otoliths showed no differences between sub-areas of the lagoon system and the recorded limited between-years variability showed no persistent temporal pattern. The maximum age of leaping mullet in the Messolonghi - Etoliko lagoon was 5 years for males and 6 years for females. The von Bertalanffy equation (L‡= 32. 99 ± 1. 25 cm, k= 0. 258 ± 0. 017 year- 1, t 0 =- 0. 47 ± 0. 04 year) accurately describes the growth of the total length of <b>leaping</b> <b>grey</b> <b>mullet</b> for all life stages (fry, juveniles and adults).

Therefore, the purpose of study was to investigate the effects of low water temperature on the stress response of <b>grey</b> <b>mullets</b> Mugil cephalus acclimated in freshwater. The blood samples of experimental fish (TL: 28. 2 ± 1. 1 cm, BW: 198. 6 ± 25. 9 g) were collected during winter season when the water temperature of controlled rearing system was stable at 25 °C and uncontrolled rearing system slowly dropped until 12 °C. Their stress response on both rearing systems was observed. The results showed that low temperature affected to lower the behavior activity and increase the stress response of <b>grey</b> <b>mullets.</b> The breath frequency of <b>grey</b> <b>mullet</b> regarding their opercular movement at 12 °C was 74 - 97 breath/min., while at 25 °C it was 95 - 114 breath/min.

The tendencies of cortisol and glucose level increased with the lowering temperature, showing higher value of 264. 8 ng/mL and 35. 5 mg/dL in 12 °C than 5. 5 ng/mL and 32. 7 mg/dL in 25 °C.

In four sites in Korea (Ansan, Yeosu, Tongyeong, and Busan) and two sites in Japan (Nagasaki and Fukuoka), serum VTG in immature and male <b>grey</b> <b>mullet</b> was detected at levels greater than 1. 0 μg/ml, which {{is considered to be}} an abnormal level.
