5|$|Meanwhile, Hood ordered Lt. Gen. William J. Hardee's corps on a march {{around the}} Union <b>left</b> <b>flank,</b> had Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler's cavalry march near Sherman's supply line, and had Maj. Gen. Benjamin Cheatham's corps attack the Union front. However, it took longer than {{expected}} for Hardee {{to get his}} men into position, and, during that time, McPherson had correctly deduced a possible threat to his <b>left</b> <b>flank,</b> and sent XVI Corps, his reserve, to help strengthen it. Hardee's men met this other force, and the battle began. Although the initial Confederate attack was repulsed, the Union <b>left</b> <b>flank</b> began to retreat. About this time, McPherson, who had ridden to the front to observe the battle, {{was shot and killed}} by Confederate infantry.|$|E

5|$|The {{unexpected}} French advance {{from the}} west and the fall of the Shevardino redoubt threw the Russian formation into disarray. Since the <b>left</b> <b>flank</b> of their defensive position had collapsed, Russian forces withdrew to the east, constructing a makeshift position centered around the village of Utitsa. The <b>left</b> <b>flank</b> of the Russian position was thus ripe for a flanking attack.|$|E

5|$|Beginning around 1 pm, Union {{artillery}} fired first, initially upon infantry in the woods, {{and later}} upon any Confederate artillery that attempted {{to move into}} firing position. On the Confederate <b>left</b> <b>flank,</b> two batteries from Whiting's division and one from Jackson's soon began firing from their position upon Darius Couch's division of the IV Corps, who were {{near the center of}} the Union line. This began a fierce firefight, with the Union's eight batteries and 37 guns concentrated against three Confederate batteries and sixteen guns. The Union fire silenced the Rowan Artillery and made their position untenable. The other two Confederate batteries, placed by Jackson himself, were in somewhat better positions, and managed to keep firing. Over a period of more than three hours, a total of six or eight Confederate batteries engaged the Union Army from the Confederate <b>left</b> <b>flank,</b> but they were usually engaged only one at a time.|$|E

5|$|On the Confederate {{right flank}} {{a total of}} six {{batteries}} engaged the Federals, but they did so one-by-one instead of in unison, and each was consecutively cut to pieces by concentrated Union artillery fire. Moreover, they engaged the Union artillery later than the guns of the <b>left</b> <b>flank,</b> so the desired crossfire bombardment was never achieved.|$|E
5|$|Phase 2: Knowing {{that the}} Byzantine army was {{focusing}} on the Muslim right, Khalid ibn al-Walid launched an attack with his mobile guard, along with the Muslim right flank cavalry. Khalid ibn al-Walid struck at the right flank of the Byzantines left center, and the cavalry reserve of the Muslims right center struck at the Byzantines left center at its <b>left</b> <b>flank.</b> Meanwhile, he ordered the Muslims' right wing cavalry to strike at the <b>left</b> <b>flank</b> of the Byzantines left wing. The combat soon developed into a bloodbath. Many fell on both sides. Khalid's timely flanking attacks again saved the day for Muslims and by dusk the Byzantines had been pushed back to the positions they had {{at the start of}} the battle.|$|E
5|$|Plans for the Normandy {{invasion}} included five assault landings {{from the}} sea, supported by airborne landings on both flanks by British and American airborne divisions. In {{what would be}} its first action, the 6th Airborne Division was chosen {{to land on the}} <b>left</b> <b>flank</b> of the British landing zone. Its primary objective on day one was to capture intact two bridges over the Caen canal and the River Orne. The division's secondary objective was the destruction of the Merville gun battery, which could engage ships landing nearby at Sword. To prevent German reinforcements approaching the invasion area from the east, 6th Airborne also had to destroy the bridges crossing the River Dives then dig in around Ranville and hold the <b>left</b> <b>flank</b> of the advance.|$|E
50|$|On 25 September 1918 the French 4th Army {{went on the}} {{offensive}} {{in conjunction with the}} American drive in the Meuse-Argonne.

At one point the 369th advanced faster than French troops on their right and <b>left</b> <b>flanks,</b> and risked being cut off. By the time the regiment pulled back for reorganization, it had advanced 14 km through severe German resistance.|$|R
50|$|To {{face the}} threat from Silesia, the Russians withdrew men from East Prussia and from the front facing the Austro-Hungarians The {{geographical}} barrier that separated {{the bulk of the}} opposing armies was the Vistula River. The Russian corps marching north to fill the gap moved along the east bank of the Vistula, which protected their <b>left</b> <b>flanks.</b> The troop movements involved both the Southwest Front commanded by Nikolay Iudovich Ivanov and the Northwest Front under Nikolai Ruzsky. Their movements were poorly coordinated.|$|R
60|$|Conflans {{supposed}} {{that the fire}} of his guns had driven the whole of his opponents in a panic from Chambol; and, determining {{to take advantage of}} the confusion, marched with his force against them. Forde at once prepared for the battle. In the centre he placed the English, including the rajah's forty Europeans. Next to these, on either side, he placed his Sepoys, and posted the troops of Anandraz on the right and <b>left</b> <b>flanks.</b> He then advanced towards the enemy.|$|R
5|$|The Sisak OG {{assigned}} the 10th Brigade of the Croatian TO {{to support the}} right flank of the 102nd Infantry Brigade.

5|$|The exact {{position}} of the Polish Army is unknown, {{but part of the}} Polish right flank, moving quietly in the dense mist, encircled Maximilian's <b>left</b> <b>flank.</b> After the mist began to clear the Archduke realized his force was being flanked and his retreat to Byczyna was threatened. He ordered an attack, but a miscommunication of his orders confused part of his army and the Hungarian regiment began to retreat. The Polish left wing, under command of future Hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski, dispersed the opposing units. The battle saw more infantry action than many others of the Commonwealth but, even so, the Polish cavalry (Polish winged hussars) played a major part. The battle began with some duels between elears (cavalry champions), soon followed by Polish cavalry charges, on the <b>left</b> <b>flank</b> and in the center, which did not result in any significant breakthroughs for either side. Zamoyski is said to have commanded the battle very well, turning it at several points. Eventually a Polish hussar counterattack on the <b>left</b> <b>flank</b> mauled Maximilan's Hungarian cavalry and forced his army to start giving ground. The bloody retreat quickly turned into a general rout during which the Archduke's army suffered heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|But on {{the wings}} the {{situation}} was different. Qanatir, commanding the Byzantine <b>left</b> <b>flank</b> which consisted of mainly Slavs, attacked in force, and the Muslim infantry on the right flank had to retreat. Amr, the Muslim right wing commander ordered his cavalry regiment to counterattack, which neutralized the Byzantine advance and stabilized the battle line on the right for some time, but the Byzantine numerical superiority caused them to retreat towards the Muslim base camp.|$|E

Zhuge Liang rejected the plan {{because it was too}} ambitious and went for a more cautious approach. The objective was to seize Chang'an along with Tianshui, Anding, Nan'an, and Mount Qi.|$|R
