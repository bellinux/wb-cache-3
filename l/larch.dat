5|$|By {{the middle}} of 1936, the US27/M-78 routing through Lansing was split into two. The {{mainline}} was restricted to cars only and moved to run along Capitol Avenue. The former routing was restricted to trucks only and designated as a truck route. In 1950, the bridge for Main Street over the Grand River was completed and mainline US27/M-78 was rerouted {{to use it to}} connect to <b>Larch</b> Street. From there north, US27/M-78 followed <b>Larch</b> Street supplanting the truck route, which was decommissioned at that time.|$|E
5|$|Truck M-78 was {{a former}} truck route through the city of Lansing. It started {{at the corner of}} Capitol Avenue and Main Street and ran along Main Street to Grand Avenue. There, it turned north on Grand Avenue to Kalamazoo Street and turned east on Kalamazoo over the Grand River. At <b>Larch</b> Street, Truck M-78 {{continued}} north to rejoin the mainline at the corner of <b>Larch</b> and Saginaw streets.|$|E
5|$|Forests make {{up about}} , or 48 percent, of the province's land area. The forests consist of pines (Jack Pine, Red Pine, Eastern White Pine), spruces (White Spruce, Black Spruce), Balsam Fir, Tamarack (<b>larch),</b> poplars (Trembling Aspen, Balsam Poplar), birches (White Birch, Swamp Birch) and small pockets of Eastern White Cedar.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Larches</b> are {{conifers}} in {{the genus}} Larix, {{in the family}} Pinaceae. Growing from 20 to 45 m tall (65 to 147 ft), they are native {{to much of the}} cooler temperate northern hemisphere, on lowlands in the north and high on mountains further south. <b>Larches</b> are among the dominant plants in the boreal forests of Siberia and Canada. Although they are conifers, <b>larches</b> are deciduous trees that lose their needles in the autumn.|$|R
5|$|Maple {{and lime}} forests {{are found in}} gulleys. These forests are only present in {{isolated}} areas and {{are at risk of}} extinction. Downy oak woods are more common in the Aosta Valley area than in the Piedmont area because of its higher temperatures and lower precipitation. Oak is not a typical species in the park and it is often found mixed with Scots pine. The park's chestnut groves have been affected by human cultivation for wood and fruit. It rarely grows above 1,000 metres (3,280ft), and the most important chestnut forests are in the park's Piedmontese side. The park's conifer woods include Scots pine groves, spruce forests dominated by the Norway spruce, often mixed with <b>larch.</b> <b>Larch</b> and Swiss stone pine woods are found up to the highest sub-alpine level (2200–2300 metres (7,217-7,546ft)).|$|E

5|$|Blagdon Lake is {{designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) of , created in 1971, {{largely because of}} the variety of species and habitats. The area around the pumping station was laid out as an ornamental woodland which includes Scots pine, Cedar, <b>Larch,</b> Spruce, Oak, Beech, Chestnut, Willow, Lime, Holly and Maple. A variety of orchids including green-winged orchid (Anacamptis morio) and southern marsh-orchids can be seen on the borders of the lake.|$|E
5|$|Business M-78 (Bus. M-78) was a {{business}} loop through the city of Lansing.

5|$|In late 1962, US16 was {{decommissioned}} in {{the state}} of Michigan as Interstate 96 (I-96) was completed. With the removal of US16, several highways were rerouted through Lansing. M-43 was rerouted along M-78 to Grand River Avenue and then along Grand River Avenue to replace US16 east to Webberville. The former M-43 on Michigan Avenue east of Cedar and <b>Larch</b> streets was redesignated M-143.|$|E

On the slopes is a forestry plantation, known as Hell Fire Wood, which consists of Sitka spruce, <b>larch</b> and beech.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{creation}} of the Capitol Loop, M-143 and Michigan Avenue in Lansing was partially transferred back to local control. The section between Cedar and <b>Larch</b> streets was retained as part of the new Capitol Loop and the remainder inside the city of Lansing was removed from the state trunkline highway system on October 13, 1989. At the time, M-143 in the City of East Lansing was not transferred, and MDOT removed the signage, creating an unsigned trunkline.|$|E

5|$|Australian mycologist John Burton Cleland noted it {{occurring}} under <b>larch</b> (Larix), oak, pine, birch {{and other}} introduced trees in South Australia in 1934, {{and it has}} subsequently been recorded in New South Wales, Victoria (where it was found near Betula and Populus) and Western Australia. It has been recorded under introduced birch (Betula) and hazel (Corylus) in New Zealand. Mycologist Rolf Singer reported a similar situation in South America, with the species recorded under introduced trees in Chile. It {{is likely to have}} been transported to those countries in the soil of imported European trees.|$|E
5|$|Business Loop Interstate 96 (BL I-96) is a {{business}} loop of I-96 through the city of Lansing. The western terminus is at I-96's exit90 northwest of Lansing in Watertown Township in Clinton County near the I-96/I-69 junction. From there, it follows Grand River Avenue under I-96. East of I-96, BL I-96 intersects Francis Road, which provides access to I-69, and then passes under I-69. Grand River Avenue is three lanes, one in each direction divided by a central turn lane, and runs past light industrial areas, crossing into Lansing and Eaton County near the Capital Region International Airport. The area around the airport is commercial, but east of there North Grand River Avenue runs through residential neighborhoods. Near the intersection with Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard, the business loop runs along the Grand River and then BL I-96 turns eastward on North Street to an interchange with Cedar and <b>Larch</b> streets. The business loop turns and splits onto the one-way pairing of the three-lane Cedar (southbound) and <b>Larch</b> (northbound). As it runs southward, the highway runs parallel to the Grand River through Old Town Lansing. At Oakland Avenue (westbound) and Saginaw Avenue (eastbound), BL I-96 intersects the two one-way streets that carry BL I-69. It continues south through {{the eastern edge of}} downtown Lansing.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{and animals}} include those {{generally}} common to Central Europe. Beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute {{one-third of the}} forests; conifers are increasing {{as a result of}} reforestation. Spruce and fir trees predominate in the upper mountains, while pine and <b>larch</b> are found in sandy soil. There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Wild animals include roe deer, wild boar, mouflon (a subspecies of wild sheep), fox, badger, hare, and small numbers of the Eurasian beaver. The blue cornflower was once a German national symbol.|$|E
50|$|In {{the west}} of the city, around 30 minutes from the city centre, <b>Larches</b> is a {{box-shaped}} ward from the Riversway dual-carriageway into Blackpool to Haslam Park. It contains two post-war housing estates, <b>Larches</b> and Savick, and an area of suburban sprawl moved in from Ashton following boundary changes. The ward contains the whole of Ashton Park.|$|R

50|$|<b>Larches</b> {{is one of}} {{the districts}} of Preston, Lancashire, England. The area, north-west of Preston city centre, is a mix of social and private housing, {{although}} both components of the ward - <b>Larches,</b> and Savick - are largely post-war council estates. Ashton Park {{is in the middle of}} the current ward, which borders Riversway and the civil parish of Lea.The area of <b>Larches</b> is part of Ashton-on-Ribble, which was part of the former hundred of Amounderness. With small businesses and shops in the area, the population are largely commute-to-work families and retirees.The citywide Preston Bus service runs through both sides of the <b>Larches</b> ward, and routes operated by Stagecoach between Preston and Blackpool also serve the area.Three members of Preston City Council, elected 'in thirds' in first past the post elections each year, are returned from the ward.The ward and neighbouring Ashton forms part of the Lancashire County Council electoral division of Preston North West.|$|R
5|$|The Tree Streets is {{a network}} of streets in the Mount Pleasant portion of the village. Several of the streets are named after {{regional}} trees, including Satinwood Lane, <b>Larch</b> Road, and Oak Road. A number of houses in the neighborhood were constructed during a 1930s building boom, circling Jackson Park and near Todd Elementary School. The Crossroads {{is a group of}} 84 houses on streets named after local World War II veterans, including Schrade Road, Hazelton Circle, Matthes Road, and Dunn Lane. It was constructed at the end of World War II to provide affordable housing to returning veterans, and was completed in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{chosen for}} nest holes have soft {{heartwood}} and tough sapwood, the former often due to parasites or diseases that weaken the tree's core. It {{is not certain}} how suitable trees are selected, {{although it may be}} by drumming, since woods with differing elastic modulus and density may transmit sound at different speeds. A Japanese study found nests in trees from many families; these included grey alder, Japanese white birch, Japanese hop-hornbeam, Japanese tree lilac, willows, Japanese <b>larch</b> and Sargent's cherry. The Mongolian oak and prickly castor-oil tree were rarely if ever used.|$|E
5|$|When {{the state}} highway system was first signposted in 1919, the east–west highway across the Lower Peninsula through Lansing to Detroit was {{assigned}} the M-16 designation. M-16 was rerouted in the Lansing area in 1925, running along Grand River Avenue from Grand Ledge to East Lansing. The former routing through Downtown Lansing on Michigan Avenue {{became part of}} M-39. This was redesignated US16 in 1926. With the completion of I-96 in between Lansing and Brighton, US16 was decommissioned in Michigan in 1962. The former routing of US16 {{on the north side}} of Lansing was redesignated as BL I-96. Through downtown, it followed the former US27 on <b>Larch</b> Street. There, BL I-96 joined US27 along a one-way pairing of <b>Larch</b> and Cedar streets. Where US27 turned to join M-78 at Main Street, BL I-96 continued along US127 along Cedar Street to terminate at I-96 south of the city at exit 104. In 1963, BL I-96 was rerouted onto the first portion of the I-496 freeway to be constructed southeast of the city. This rerouting would last until 1966 when it was transferred back to the original routing with the completion of the US127 freeway between Lansing and Mason. BL I-96 was rerouted along M-43/Bus. M-78 to the I-496/M-78 freeway and back to I-96 at exit 106. Once the US127 freeway was completed, BL I-96 was rerouted back along the former US127 routing to I-96.|$|E
