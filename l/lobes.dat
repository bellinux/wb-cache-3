5|$|The {{preserved}} {{contents of}} its digestive tract {{are typical of}} those of other predators', and this lifestyle {{is supported by the}} raptor-like nature of the spiny great appendages {{and the size of the}} eyes.

These <b>lobes</b> presumably derived from the lateral <b>lobes</b> of Cambrian anomalocaridids, ancestors that used <b>lobes</b> along their sides to swim, and lacked the specializations of Schinderhannes.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{brains are}} divided into several regions. At the front are the {{olfactory}} <b>lobes,</b> a pair of structures that receive and process signals from the nostrils via the two olfactory nerves. The olfactory <b>lobes</b> are very large in fish that hunt primarily by smell, such as hagfish, sharks, and catfish. Behind the olfactory <b>lobes</b> is the two-lobed telencephalon, the structural equivalent to the cerebrum in higher vertebrates. In fish the telencephalon is concerned mostly with olfaction. Together these structures form the forebrain.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} work was to observe the activation/deactivation of {{cerebral}} functional regions after electroacupuncture (EA) at Yintang (EX-HN 3) and GV 20 by functional MRI (fMRI). Design: A total of 12 healthy volunteers were stimulated by EA at Yintang and GV 20 for 30 min. Resting-state fMRI scans were performed before EA, and at 5 and 15 min after needle removal. Statistical parametric mapping was used to preprocess initial data, and regional homogeneity (ReHo) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) were analysed. Results: ReHo at 5 min post stimulation showed increases in the left temporal <b>lobe</b> and cerebellum and decreases in the left parietal <b>lobe,</b> occipital <b>lobe</b> and right precuneus. At 15 min post stimulation, ReHo showed increases in the left fusiform gyrus; lingual gyrus; middle temporal gyrus; postcentral gyrus; limbic lobe; cingulate gyrus; paracentral lobule; cerebellum, posterior <b>lobe,</b> declive; right cuneus and cerebellum, anterior <b>lobe,</b> culmen. It also showed decreases in the left frontal <b>lobe,</b> parietal <b>lobe,</b> right temporal <b>lobe,</b> frontal <b>lobe,</b> parietal <b>lobe</b> and right cingulate gyrus. ALFF at 5 min post stimulation showed increases in the right temporal <b>lobe,</b> but decreases in the right limbic <b>lobe</b> and posterior cingulate gyrus. At 15 min post stimulation ALFF showed increases in the left frontal <b>lobe,</b> parietal <b>lobe,</b> occipital <b>lobe,</b> right temporal <b>lobe,</b> parietal <b>lobe,</b> occipital <b>lobe</b> and cerebellum, but decreases in the left frontal <b>lobe,</b> anterior cingulate gyrus, right frontal <b>lobe</b> and posterior cingulate gyrus. Conclusions: After EA stimulation at Yintang and GV 20, which are associated with psychiatric disorder treatments, changes were localised in the frontal <b>lobe,</b> cingulate gyrus and cerebellum. Changes were higher in number and intensity at 15 min than at 5 min after needle removal, demonstrating lasting and strong after-effects of EA on cerebral functional regions.

5|$|The Lobata have {{a pair of}} <b>lobes,</b> {{which are}} muscular, cuplike {{extensions}} {{of the body that}} project beyond the mouth. Their inconspicuous tentacles originate from the corners of the mouth, running in convoluted grooves and spreading out over the inner surface of the <b>lobes</b> (rather than trailing far behind, as in the Cydippida). Between the <b>lobes</b> {{on either side of the}} mouth, many species of lobates have four auricles, gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward the mouth. This combination of structures enables lobates to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey.|$|E

5|$|Paranotal {{hypothesis}}: This hypothesis {{suggests that}} the insect's wings developed from paranotal <b>lobes,</b> a preadaptation found in insect fossils that {{is believed to have}} assisted stabilization while hopping or falling. In favor of this hypothesis is the tendency of most insects, when startled while climbing on branches, to escape by dropping to the ground. Such <b>lobes</b> would have served as parachutes and enable the insect to land more softly. The theory {{suggests that the}}se <b>lobes</b> gradually grew larger and in a later stage developed a joint with the thorax. Even later would appear the muscles to move these crude wings. This model implies a progressive increase in the effectiveness of the wings, starting with parachuting, then gliding and finally active flight. Still, lack of substantial fossil evidence of the development of the wing joints and muscles poses a major difficulty to the theory, as does the seemingly spontaneous development of articulation and venation, and it has been largely rejected by experts in the field.|$|E
