For example, Kuhl, Tsao, and Liu found that young English-learning infants who spent time in a <b>laboratory</b> <b>session</b> with a native Mandarin speaker were able to distinguish between phonemes that occur in Mandarin but not in English, unlike infants who were in a control condition. Infants in this control condition came to the lab as often as infants in the experimental condition, but were exposed only to English; when tested at a later date, they were unable to distinguish the Mandarin phonemes. In a second experiment, the authors presented infants with audio or audiovisual recordings of Mandarin speakers and tested the infants’ ability to distinguish between the Mandarin phonemes. In this condition, infants failed to distinguish the foreign language phonemes. This finding indicates that social interaction is a necessary component of language learning and that, even if infants are presented with the raw data of hearing a language, they are unable {{to take advantage of the}} statistical cues present in that data if they are not also experiencing the social interaction.|$|E

The New Economic Model for Malaysia, which was unveiled in 2 parts in 2010, has outlined a number Strategic Reform Initiatives ("SRIs") in support of the Economic Transformation Programme, as well as various policy measures forming the bedrock of these SRIs. The adoption of accrual accounting by the public sector was listed as one of these policy measures. This recommendation has immediately prompted the Performance Management and Delivery Unit ("PEMANDU") to bring on board some of the best and brightest amongst the public sector accountants and academia, as well as technical experts representing related bodies such as the Malaysian Institute of Accountants and the Malaysian Accounting Standards Board to draw up the transition roadmap through a six-week <b>laboratory</b> <b>session.</b> According to the roadmap, accrual accounting will be adopted in the financial reporting by the public sector with effect from 1 January 2015, using bases and policies which are consistent in all material respect with accrual basis IPSAS.|$|E

40|$|Background: Department of Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS) offer {{undergraduate}} {{medical students}} {{a state of}} art lab, which is well equipped with modern instruments and well trained staff. Methods: Students {{have the opportunity to}} learn basic and modern diagnostic techniques as required in the fields of anatomy, biochemistry, pharmacology and physiology. Module-wise approach has been adapted to design <b>laboratory</b> <b>sessions</b> {{in such a way that}} all the disciplines are well integrated. Since the establishment of the Medical College at Aga Khan University, biochemistry discipline has introduced latest diagnostic techniques, such as radio-assays, chromatography and protein electrophoresis in <b>laboratory</b> <b>sessions.</b> To keep pace with expanding research in basic sciences and development in molecular diagnostic techniques, new advances have continuously been introduced, replacing older techniques with more sophisticated instruments and procedures [...] For example, the electrophoresis followed by scanning on a densitometer has been replaced by scanning on a gel doc. Likewise introduction of ELISA plate reader gives students an idea of microanalysis and rapid procedures instead of the use of conventional spectrophotometer. The <b>laboratory</b> <b>sessions</b> involving polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA electrophoresis, recombinant DNA techniques have been offered as a diagnostic tool because the expansion of molecular biology techniques have made it possible to diagnose several diseases including the infectious diseases. Results: The biochemistry <b>laboratory</b> <b>sessions</b> are designed so students can correlate their results with clinical scenarios. Several reports have confirmed that undergraduate <b>laboratory</b> <b>sessions</b> and research experiences provide scientific knowledge, practical skills, understanding of the nature of science, teamwork abilities, and developing interest in science.

40|$|Abstract – Learning about Computer Engineering is {{a highly}} {{constructive}} process. At our department, computer engineering encompasses three courses and a <b>laboratory</b> <b>session.</b> In order to successfully learn the subject, the students should have hands-on experience with tools. While tools to program (compilers, interpreters, development environments) are widely available for free on the internet, the situation is different for computer engineering. To learn the foundations of digital design, a tool to design and simulate digital circuits is needed. To master microprocessors and microcontrollers, access to assemblers and simulators is needed. To master computer architecture, access to an architectural simulator is needed. The <b>laboratory</b> <b>session</b> requires either an extended on-campus phase or necessitates web access to the devices (processor test cards, oscilloscopes, etc) in the lab. We present an overview of our efforts {{in the last five}} years, through which we have provided students with web access to all the tools and devices above...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} {{a new approach}} to perform the laboratories sessions in engineering courses using remote laboratory. Our approach is that for each <b>laboratory</b> <b>session,</b> there are sets of user interfaces designed as services available for the learners. Each service allows applying some inputs (if any) to the physical equipment and returns some selected output signals from the equipment. These outputs signals can be measured and/or saved. In order to obtain the required results formulated by the teacher in his/her learning scenario, the remote learner has to select the services that match the best, and be able to perform all necessary calculations and analysis We refer to this approach as constructional, since, to achieve a given task, the user has to search and choose the appropriate user interfaces designed as services among many others available. The teacher is also able to assess whether the learner has understood the theoretical concepts previously studied in class.

40|$|Abstract: The Virtual Laboratory Practical Class (VLPC) {{computer}} {{program is a}} resource aimed at improving practical laboratory performance and understanding in a second-year pharmacology student cohort. In our evaluation of the program, half of the 233 students were provided access to the VLPC before their <b>laboratory</b> <b>session</b> and half {{after the completion of}} their experiment. Surveys were conducted to gauge student perception and understanding of the laboratory experiment. In addition, data measuring student completion times for the laboratory task were collected. Students who used the VLPC before the class reported an increase in their confidence in successfully completing the live practical experiment. They also showed a significant decrease in the mean completion time for the real <b>laboratory</b> <b>session.</b> No effect of the VLPC on assignment scores was observed, however this is likely due to the content of the program, which comprised only a very minor portion of these assessable laboratory reports.
