40|$|Thermosonic (Sonic IR) Imaging {{is a new}} {{nondestructive}} testing (NDT) technique that uses high-frequency sonic excitation together with infrared (IR) detection to image surface and subsurface defects. This Sonic IR imaging technique uses a short (usually fraction of a second) pulse of high frequency (typically 20 - 40 kHz) sound which is applied at some convenient point {{on the surface of}} the object under inspection to produce localized frictional heating at the defect. An IR camera images the heating of the surface resulting from the effects of friction or other irreversible internal surface interactions in the vicinity of defects. These effects result from the fact that the two surfaces of internal defects do not move in unison when sound propagates in the object. Conventional thermosonic imaging system employs an ultrasonic welder, which is designed of a single frequency. This single frequency ultrasonic source has been found to yield 2 ̆ 2 blind zone 2 ̆ 2 for NDT due to the formation of a standing waves inside the test piece. To overcome this limitation, a spring <b>loaded</b> ultrasonic <b>transducer</b> was used to generate the desired multi-frequency acoustic chaos in the test object [1]. This simple design turns the preciseness of the frequency of ultrasonic horns into devices of a very broad discrete spectrum of sound into the object to which they are coupled.

In this work, we present a development of a novel thermosonic imaging system, which is capable of exciting the ultrasonic transducer at different frequencies for thermosonic NDT to overcome the limitations associated with single frequency power source as well as the spring <b>loaded</b> <b>transducer</b> design.

Two FMVSS 208 dolly rollover tests with instrumented, restrained driver side Hybrid III dummies were evaluated during the first driver’s side roof rail ground strike. Kinematic targets were mounted on the driver dummy head and tracked via onboard cameras as a means of visual validation of roof rail deformation (assuming rail-to-dummy head contact). Test instrumentation included: accelerometers at the vehicle center of gravity (CG), roof rail, pillars and rocker panel, lap and shoulder belt <b>load</b> <b>transducers,</b> triaxial accelerometers at the center of gravity of the head, chest and pelvis of the dummies and six-axis force (and moment) transducers in the neck of the dummy. All data was recorded consistent with SAE J 211 - 1 recommendations Vehicle angular velocity and attitude were estimated using the data from multiple accelerometers, which correlated well with the test video. The accelerometer data indicate that the driver roof rail dynamic deformation was significantly greater than the residual deformation to which the roof rail rebounded following loss of ground contact. The dynamic deformation was of such magnitude that the rail intruded into the driver’s occupant survival space. A spike in driver dummy head acceleration was observed immediately following the acceleration pulse that caused the rail intrusion The presence of significant dynamic roof rail deformation is new and important quantitative information that should be added to the body of knowledge surrounding reconsideration of FMVSS 216 and catastrophic injury prevention in rollover crashes...|$|R
