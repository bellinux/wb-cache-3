This paper studies how the trawler delivery obligation (TDO) regime influences aspects of the harvesting pattern, focusing on the temporal and geographic distribution of landings. The analysis shows that the trawlers as a group have far less seasonal variations in their cod landings compared to the coastal fleet. While the Norwegian fleet lands about 75 % during the first half-year, the corresponding share for trawlers is about 50 %. Contrary to the initial hypothesis, the independent trawlers fished the most off-season; about 57 % of their total landings. Trawlers controlled by vertically integrated firms landed considerably less (about 45 %) and independently owned trawlers with <b>landing</b> <b>obligations</b> fell between these two strategic groups (about 50 %). Vertically integrated vessels have a higher fulfilment of their <b>landing</b> <b>obligations</b> than the independently owned.

By combining results from semi-structured interviews with small-scale fishers and a bioeconomic model, we found that the percentage of discards for small-scale fisheries is usually low, which is consistent with general empirical observations globally but can be high when quotas are exhausted. Our results also confirm that the <b>landing</b> <b>obligation</b> would generate negative impacts on fishers' activities by investing more time on-board to handle previously discarded fishes, and putting at risk the security of fishers at sea due to full use of allowable storage on-board coupled with often adverse sea conditions in Galician bays.

40|$|A <b>landing</b> <b>obligation</b> was {{formally}} {{implemented in the}} European Union (EU) for the first time, {{as part of the}} recent reform of the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). Given the reasonable success of the <b>landing</b> <b>obligation</b> in some countries such as the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Norway, this policy is seen as a viable approach to tackle the long-recognized discarding problem in EU waters. However, there has been some debate on whether there is sufficient evidence to support the feasibility of such a measure in the EU-CFP. The EU <b>landing</b> <b>obligation</b> will implicitly include all small-scale fisheries (SSF) provided the species captured are subject to catch limits or minimum sizes (in the case of the Mediterranean). SSF were included irrespective {{of the fact that the}} discarding problem in the EU has been historically associated with medium- to large-scale fleets (in particular largely mixed species trawl fisheries). Additionally, past experiences with a discard ban policy are still limited to specific countries and/or specific fisheries. This paper examined the appropriateness and feasibility of the recently implemented EU <b>landing</b> <b>obligation</b> in SSF. The effects in the long-term are unpredictable, but available evidence suggests that in the short to medium-term a <b>landing</b> <b>obligation</b> is likely to bring more negative social, economic and ecological impacts than benefits.

40|$|The <b>landing</b> <b>obligation</b> {{policy was}} one of the major {{innovations}} introduced in the last Common Fisheries Policy reform in Europe. It is foreseen that the policy will affect the use of fishing opportunities and hence the economic performance of the fleets. The problem with fishing opportunities could be solved if single-stock total allowable catches (TACs) could be achieved simultaneously for all the stocks. In this study, we evaluate the economic impact of the <b>landing</b> <b>obligation</b> policy on the Spanish demersal fleet operating in the Iberian Sea region. To generate TAC advice, we used two sets of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) reference points, the single-stock MSY reference points defined by ICES and a set of multistock reference points calculated simultaneously using a bioeconomic optimization model. We found that the impact of the <b>landing</b> <b>obligation</b> is time and fleet dependent and highly influenced by assumptions about fleet dynamics. At fishery level, multistock reference points mitigate the decrease in the net present value generated by the implementation of the <b>landing</b> <b>obligation.</b> However at fleet level, the effect depends on the fleet itself and the period. To ensure the optimum use of fishing opportunities, the <b>landing</b> <b>obligation</b> should be accompanied by a management system that guarantees consistency between single-stock TACs. In this regard, multistock reference points represent an improvement over those currently in use. However, further investigation is necessary to enhance performance both at fleet level and in the long term. Versión del edito...|$|E

40|$|The <b>landing</b> <b>obligation</b> is {{an article}} within the European Union Common Fisheries Policy (Regulation 1380 / 2013) {{that will be}} {{introduced}} in the demersal fisheries from 2016 onwards. The policy intends to end the wasteful practice of discarding fish by-catch in the European Union. The exact implementation is subject to discussion and negotiation. The discussion takes place amongst government representatives of different European Union Member States and stakeholders at the international and national level. This thesis contributes to this discussion as it gives recommendations for a successful implementation of the <b>landing</b> <b>obligation</b> in the Netherlands. These recommendations are based on in depth analysis {{of the presence of}} conditions that could lead to successful implementation of the <b>landing</b> <b>obligation.</b> The analysis is based on a step by step approach. First a review of policy implementation and fisheries management literature has led to an initial selection of beneficial conditions in the implementation of the policy in the Netherlands. Second, an investigation of a similar <b>landing</b> <b>obligation</b> in Norway has been used to verify and refine these conditions. Consequently, the presence of these conditions in the Netherlands has been studied by studying policy documents and interviewing key informants. The most important finding of this assessment is that several key conditions seem to be absent in the Netherlands: 1) The problem as identified by the European Union, to end the wasteful practice of discarding, is not shared by all stakeholders; 2) Consequently, there is no shared vision on the need for the policy; 3) There is no urgency felt to implement the policy by fishermen nor by the general public; 4) No enforcement mechanism that would enhance the compliance of fishermen is expected to be in place; 5) The decision-making process is not considered transparent by the stakeholders. Based on the literature, it is expected that if these conditions are not met, {{it is unlikely that the}} <b>landing</b> <b>obligation</b> will turn out to be a successful policy in the Netherlands.

However, combining <b>landing</b> <b>obligations</b> with changes in fishing practices to limit the capture of unwanted fish results in trophic cascades that can benefit birds, mammals and most fish stocks.

40|$|Fisheries {{provide an}} {{abundant}} and predictable food source for many pelagic seabirds through discards, but also pose {{a major threat}} to them through bycatch, threatening their populations worldwide. The reform of the European Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), which intends to ban discards through the <b>landing</b> <b>obligation</b> of all catches, may force seabirds to seek alternative food sources, such as baited hooks from longlines, increasing bycatch rates. To test this hypothesis we performed a combined analysis of seabird-fishery interactions using as a model Scopoli's shearwaters Calonectris diomedea in the Mediterranean. Tracking data showed that the probability of shearwaters attending longliners increased exponentially with a decreasing density of trawlers. On-board observations and mortality events corroborated this result: the probability of birds attending longliners increased 4 % per each trawler leaving the longliner proximity and bird mortality increased tenfold when trawlers were not operating. Therefore, the implementation of the <b>landing</b> <b>obligation</b> in EU waters will likely cause a substantial increase in bycatch rates in longliners, at least in the short-term, due to birds switching from trawlers to longliners. Thus the implementation of the <b>landing</b> <b>obligation</b> must be carefully monitored and counterbalanced with an urgent implementation of bycatch mitigation measures in the longline fleet...|$|E

40|$|The <b>landing</b> <b>obligation</b> {{recently}} {{adopted by}} the European Union's (EU) Common Fisheries Policy aims to eradicate discards in EU fisheries. The objective {{of this paper is}} to investigate the potential social and economic impacts of the discard ban in European small-scale fisheries (SSF) and the critical factors for its successful implementation. An exhaustive systematic literature review and a stakeholder consultation were carried out in order to (i) collect detailed information about current knowledge on discards in EU SSF and gauge stakeholder perceptions about potential impacts of the discard ban in European SSF, (ii) examine the capacity of the SSF industry to implement the discard ban, and (iii) explore the limits and feasibility of implementing such a measure. The results of this study show that little attention has been given by the scientific community to discards in EU SSF. Indeed, the systematic literature review shows that this problem is relatively unexplored in the EU. In addition, the effectiveness of a discard ban in industrial fisheries is still unclear, mainly because discard data are not systematically collected by fisheries authorities. Stakeholders mostly perceive that the new <b>landing</b> <b>obligation</b> was developed with industrial fisheries in mind and that compliance with the <b>landing</b> <b>obligation</b> in EU SSF will be difficult to achieve without high economic costs, such as those related to the handling and storage of unwanted fish on board...|$|E

40|$|There {{is a need}} {{to better}} {{understand}} the survivorship of discarded fishes, both for commercial stocks and species of conservation concern. Within European waters, the <b>landing</b> <b>obligations</b> that are currently being phased in as part of the European Union's reformed common fisheries policy means that an increasing number of fish stocks, with certain exceptions, should not be discarded unless it can be demonstrated that there is a high probability of survival. This study reviews the various approaches that have been used to examine the discard survival of elasmobranchs, both in terms of at-vessel mortality (AVM) and post-release mortality (PRM), with relevant findings summarized for both the main types of fishing gear used and by taxonomic group. Discard survival varies with a range of biological attributes (species, size, sex and mode of gill ventilation) as well as the range of factors associated with capture (e. g. gear type, soak time, catch mass and composition, handling practices and the degree of exposure to air and any associated change in ambient temperature). In general, demersal species with buccal-pump ventilation have a higher survival than obligate ram ventilators. Several studies have indicated that females may have a higher survival than males.

40|$|Executive Summary In {{biological}} terms, a discard ban will {{be beneficial}} if total removals are reduced. From an economic perspective {{it is important}} that this reduction in total removals is done in a cost-effective way. For a <b>landing</b> <b>obligation</b> to help to reduce or avoid discards, either a high level of surveillance or proper economic incentives to land the catch are needed. If a <b>landing</b> <b>obligation</b> is established but there are no incentives to avoid undersized fish, the exploitation pattern would remain unchanged and landings would include undersized individuals that would be otherwise discarded. In this case, the effort (or fishing mortality) that maximizes landings in weight (including undersized fish) will be higher than the effort (fishing mortality) that maximizes landings without the <b>landing</b> <b>obligation</b> (that did not include undersized fish). This happens because in the long-term higher fishing effort and fishing mortality level lead to lower average size of the individuals. If quotas are set accordingly to landing maximisation, this could lead to a lower biomass at sea and larger landings but a reduction of their average size. For some fisheries a <b>landing</b> <b>obligation</b> could provide by itself (i. e., with no need of more measures) an incentive to improve selectivity, either because the storage capacity on board is constrained or because sorting time is too large. If fish that was previously discarded could be avoided, then compared to the current situation (with the same effort or quota level), landings above Minimum Landing Size (MLS) would increase together with the average weight of landings and the biomass at sea. Hence, we identify the economic and social criteria to evaluate discard mitigation strategies. These criteria can be divided in three groups: changes in the economic performance, changes in employment, and changes in production. A series of parameters are provided, that need {{to be taken into account}} in order to measure the economic and social impacts of each Discard Mitigation Strategies (DMS) or of any other defined management scenario...|$|E
