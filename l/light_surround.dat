The savages' examples are {{dealt with in the}} next essay; the Catholic marvels in the essay on 'Comparative Psychical Research'. For Pascal, consult L'Amulette de Pascal, by M. Lelut; for Iamblichus, see essay on 'Ancient Spiritualism'. As to Welsh, the evidence for the light in which he shone is printed in Dr. Hill Burton's Scot Abroad (i. 289), from a Wodrow MS. in Glasgow University. Mr. Welsh was minister of Ayr. He was meditating in his garden late at night. One of his friends 'chanced to open a window towards the place where he walked, and saw clearly a strange <b>light</b> <b>surround</b> him, and heard him speak strange words about his spiritual joy'. Hill Burton thinks that this verges on the Popish superstition. The truth is that eminent ministers shared the privileges of Mediums and of some saints. Examples of miraculous cures by ministers, of clairvoyance on their part, of spirit-raps attendant on them, and of prophecy, are current on Presbyterian hagiology. No ministers, to our knowledge, were 'levitated,' but some nearly flew out of their pulpits. Patrick Walker, in his Biographia Presbyteriana, vol. ii. p. 21, mentions a supernatural light which floated round The Sweet Singers, Meikle John Gibb and his friends, before they burned a bible. Mr. Gibb afterwards excelled as a pow-wow, or Medicine Man, among the Red Indians.|$|E

5000|$|The Mandaeans group {{existence}} {{into two}} main categories: light and dark. They have a dualistic view of life, which encompasses {{both good and}} evil; all good {{is thought to have}} come from the World of Light (i.e. lightworld) and all evil {{is considered to be a}} product of the World of Darkness. In relation to the body-mind dualism coined by Descartes, Mandaeans consider the body, and all material, worldly things, to have come from the Dark, while the soul (sometimes referred to as the mind) is a product of the lightworld. Mandaeans believe the World of Light is ruled by a heavenly being, known by many names, such as “Life,” “Lord of Greatness,” “Great Mind,” or “King of Light” (Rudolph 1983). This being is so great, vast, and incomprehensible that there are no words to fully depict how awesome Life is. It is believed that an innumerable number of beings, manifested from the <b>light,</b> <b>surround</b> Life and perform cultic acts of worship to praise and honor this great being (1983). They inhabit worlds separate from the lightworld and are commonly referred to as emanations from First Life; their names include Second, Third, and Fourth Life (i.e. Yōšamin, Abathur, and Ptahil [...] ) (1983).|$|E

40|$|Corresponding colors {{data for}} complex images were {{obtained}} using an adjustment method. Experiments {{were carried out}} for printed images viewed at a high luminance in a <b>light</b> <b>surround</b> under CIE illuminant D 50 simulators that were matched by CRT-displayed images using both CIE illuminant D 65 and D 50 white points at a lower luminance level in a dark surround. The results show expected chromatic adaptation effects, but indicate little or no surround and luminance level effects. The data were then used to evaluate 1 various color appearance models and chromatic adaptation transforms. It was shown that a simple linear transformation of tristimulus values between viewing conditions provided a good description of the data.

30|$|Referring to Table  4, {{values for}} {{vertical}} illumination were higher for side location point than the corresponding center location point. This was mainly {{due to the}} geometric relationship between the location points {{and the source of}} light - the ambient <b>light,</b> <b>surround</b> light and reflected light off the task surface. There were two factors to consider: first, the difference in distances from the light sources; second and the more importantly, the amount of light, E(+x) seen at the point locations. The first factor favored the center location point but the second favored the side location points. This was because center location point {{was in the middle of}} the table and only half of the light that was in front of the location point contributed to its vertical illumination. As can be seen from Table  3, all the values of Vertical Illumination and Contrast Ratios for center location points were less than that of the side location points. As a consequence, all CRs for side location points were less than that of the corresponding center location point.|$|E
40|$|When a {{black and}} a white square on a grey {{surround}} exchange places, it was previously shown that on a dark surround it is the white square, and on a <b>light</b> <b>surround</b> it is the black square, that is seen in apparent motion (AM). Thus the higher-contrast square carries the AM. We now show that {{the same is true}} for second-order AM of texture-defined squares. Squares were defined by four different textures: by anisotropy (horizontal versus vertical random dashes), by alpha numeric letters, by hash marks, or by dot size. The result was that the square that differed more from the surround in texture properties carried the second-order AM. Judgments of texture salience revealed a high correlation between salience and apparent motion. In a third experiment, crossover AM between dissimilar textures was investigated, and it was found that the more salient textures carried the AM. Results cannot be explained by the concept of "texture activity', but instead indicate that the system extracts a measure of "texture contrast' prior to analysis of salience and apparent motion...|$|E

40|$|A key {{challenge}} for the visual system is to extract constant object properties from incoming sensory information. This information is ambiguous because the same sensory signal can arise from many combinations of object properties and viewing conditions and noisy because of the variability in sensory encoding. The competing accounts for perceptual constancy of surface lightness fall into two classes of model: One derives lightness estimates from border contrasts, and another explicitly infers surface reflectance. To test these accounts, we combined a novel psychophysical task with probabilistic implementations of both models. Observers compared the lightness of two stimuli under a memory demand (a delay between the stimuli), a context change (different surround luminance), or both. Memory biased perceived lightness toward {{the mean of the}} whole stimulus ensemble. Context change caused the classical simultaneous lightness contrast effect, in which a target appears lighter against a dark surround and darker against a <b>light</b> <b>surround.</b> These effects were not independent: Combined memory load and context change elicited a bias smaller than predicted assuming an independent combination of biases. Both models explain the memory bias as an effect of prior expectations on perception. Both models also produce a context effect, but only the reflectance model correctly describes the magnitude. The reflectance model, finally, captures the memory-context interaction better than the contrast model, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We conclude that (a) lightness perception is more consistent with reflectance inference than contrast coding and (b) adding a memory demand to a perceptual task both renders it more ecologically valid and helps adjudicate between competing models...|$|E
40|$|We report Hubble Space Telescope {{near-infrared}} NICMOS {{observations of}} a remarkable low-luminosity Class I (protostellar) {{source in the}} Taurus Molecular Cloud. IRAS 04325 + 2402 exhibits a complex bipolar scattered light nebula. The central continuum source is resolved and may be multiple, or may be crossed by a small dust lane. Complex arcs seen in scattered <b>light</b> <b>surround</b> the central source; the physical nature of these structures is not clear, but they may reflect perturbations from multiple stellar sources or from time-dependent mass ejection. A second, resolved continuum source is found at a projected distance of approximately 1150 AU from the central region, {{near the edge of}} a nebular lobe probably produced by outflow. The images indicate that this second source is another low-luminosity young stellar object, seen nearly edge-on through a dusty disk and envelope system with disk diameter ∼ 60 AU. We suggest that the scattered light "streaks" associated with this second source are limb-brightened outflow cavities in the dusty envelope, possibly perturbed by interaction with the outflow lobes of the main source. The nature of the companion is uncertain, since it is observed mostly in scattered light, but is most probably a very low mass star or brown dwarf, with a minimum luminosity of ∼ 10 ^- 2. Our results show that protostellar sources may have multiple centers of infall and non-aligned disks and outflows, even on relatively small scales.

40|$|We {{obtained}} (apparently) linear {{responses to}} luminance from three special displays of apparent motion, Vernier offset and stereoscopic depth. In our motion stimulus {{a dark and}} a light bar exchanged luminances repetitively on a grey surround. Motion was attributed to the bar that differed more from the surround, that is, on a dark surround the light bar appeared to jump, and on a <b>light</b> <b>surround</b> the dark bar appeared to jump. The apparent motion disappeared when the luminance of the surround lay halfway between that of the bars - on a linear, not a logarithmic scale. Similar results were obtained for special Vernier offset and stereo stimuli. These results cannot be explained if all luminances are processed within the same luminance pathway and that pathway transforms input luminance using non-linear compression. However, the apparent linearity of our results could arise from opposite and equal non-linearities cancelling out within separate ON- and OFF-spatial luminance pathways. A second set of experiments presented one bar separately into each eye on different surrounds (dichoptic presentation of competing apparent motion signals) or manipulated the display spatially so that different surrounds were associated with different bars (binocular presentation of competing Vernier targets). Results showed that apparent motion and Vernier signals of equal Weber contrast (normalisation of linear difference to surround luminance) evoked equal-motion and equal Vernier offset strengths. Given that motion and Vernier strength followed Weber's law, we infer that the ON- and OFF-pathways transform luminance non-linearly. Our third experiment presents {{an example of a}} brightness bisection task in which we were able to influence the bisection steps, to follow either a linear or non-linear series.

40|$|White {{wines are}} liable to develop haze during storage and {{transport}} due to residual protein in the finished wine. Since haze in white wines is considered unacceptable, winemakers attempt to reduce the protein content prior to bottling {{through the use of}} fining agents such as bentonite. The use of bentonite is not without economic cost with the estimated annual impact to the New Zealand wine industry in the region of NZD 35 million. The optimum quantity of bentonite to be used is normally determined using a heat test in conjunction with empirical fining trials. During these tests the winemaker is required to conduct various haze comparisons. Since these assessments are difficult to perform visually, researchers recommend the use of suitable nephelometric instrumentation to ensure consistency and precision. Despite these recommendations, most winemakers have not purchased the necessary equipment; it is thought that cost is the primary deterrent. The overall goal of this project was to explore the relationships between nephelometry, digital imaging and human perception of haze in terms of thresholds and intensity. In addition, the feasibility of using digital imaging devices to make nephelometric measurements was to be investigated. A range of achromatic and yellow turbid suspensions were prepared by suspending synthetic polymer microspheres of diameter 0. 25 μm in aqueous solutions. Base wine stocks exhibiting high turbidity were prepared by heating commercial grade Chardonnay wine at 90 ˚ for two hours. A range of wine samples of varying turbidities were then prepared by dilution with untreated wine. Polymer microsphere suspensions and wine samples of varying visual haze were used in a series of sensory and instrumentation experiments. The sensory experiments examined haze detection thresholds and intensity scaling in human subjects. All evaluations took place in purpose designed sensory booths utilising overhead light emitting diode (LED) illumination. The booth backgrounds and sides were modified to present dark or light surrounds by hanging black or white linen on the walls. Samples were presented to human subjects in standard ISO tasting glasses and the subjects were permitted to manipulate the glass freely whilst they evaluated the samples. Turbidity measurements were made with a Hach 2100 P nephelometric device. Image data was captured using a modified Canon A 2300 digital still camera using 90 ˚ viewing geometries. Haze threshold determinations were made for achromatic and yellow microsphere suspensions using the Ascending Method of Limits (AML) and 3 -Alternate Forced Choice (3 AFC) methods. The lowest thresholds were found when achromatic suspensions were presented in a dark surround where individual thresholds ranged from 0. 21 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) to 1. 07 NTU. The highest thresholds were found when yellow suspensions were presented in a <b>light</b> <b>surround</b> where individual thresholds ranged from 1. 89 NTU to 25. 16 NTU. Heat treated Chardonnay wine samples were also evaluated in a dark surround where individual thresholds ranged from 0. 52 NTU to 1. 39 NTU. Visual haze intensities in achromatic and yellow microsphere suspensions were assessed by human subjects in dark and light surrounds using modulus Magnitude Estimation (ME). Sample luminance was determined by digitally photographing the samples under the same conditions employed for the ME evaluations. The perceived haze intensity with respect to luminance was found to follow generalised power or logarithmic functions similar to psycho-physical models commonly proposed for the response of the human visual system to brightness and lightness. The data exhibited a bi-segment nature indicative of surround and/or planar contrast induction. Similar responses were found for heat treated Chardonnay wine samples using turbidity as the independent variable. Turbidity values were measured for a range achromatic and yellow microsphere suspension samples. Luminance values were derived from digital images taken of ISO tasting glasses containing the same microsphere suspensions. The turbidity and luminance values were found to be linearly related below 50 NTU (dark surround, R 2 = 0. 9978; <b>light</b> <b>surround,</b> R 2 = 0. 9813). A subsequent experiment examined turbidity values and luminance data in achromatic and yellow microsphere suspension samples over a low range (< 6 NTU) by imaging the sample surface directly rather than through the glass receptacle. Turbidity vales and luminance data were again found to be linearly related (R 2 = 0. 9628). Measurements from the Hach 2100 P device and a luminance based measurement model were found to be mean and median equivalent for the low range experimental data...|$|E
