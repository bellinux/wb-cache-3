40|$|ABSTRACT: Purpose: This study explores how the {{decision}} to disclose Childhood Sexual Abuse (CSA) to the legal setting for adult victims is perceived by key informants, specifically factors that are believed to facilitate or prevent <b>legal</b> <b>disclosure</b> from occurring. Background: Prevalence rates of CSA are high (Pereda, Guilera, Forns &# 38; Gomez-Benito, 2009) and the negative consequences caused by the abuse acknowledged (Filipas &# 38; Ullman, 2006). Disclosure of this crime is understood to be complex and delayed disclosure recognised (Arata, 1998) but {{little is known about}} disclosure to the legal system. Rates of <b>legal</b> <b>disclosure</b> of CSA remain low and the attrition rates high (London, Bruck, Ceci &# 38; Shuman, 2005), but investigation and understanding of the contributory factors is rare. Disclosure of CSA to the legal system enables prosecution of the abuser and protection of the victim and others. Method: 10 “key informants” consisting of specialised clinicians working with adult victims of CSA were interviewed. Each informant completed an indepth interview exploring their beliefs about factors that facilitated or prevented adult victims of CSA from disclosing their experience to the legal system. Interviews were transcribed and the qualitative data subjected to Thematic Analysis. Conclusions: Two super-ordinate themes (Legal Disclosures Are Rare: “Why would they do that?” and The Anomalies: Acknowledging that this is a crime) and four sub-ordinate themes emerged from the analysis and an analytical narrative constructed. Themes emphasised the rarity of <b>legal</b> <b>disclosure</b> and the significant number of barriers adult victims of CSA perceive.

40|$|Electronic {{discovery}} (e-discovery) is {{a growing}} concern for organizations from a legal, regulatory, and compliance perspective. E-discovery refers to the discovery of an organization’s electronically stored information (ESI). ESI can include such information as emails, instant messages, office application documents such as Microsoft Word and Excel. Currently as the United States Federal Rules of Civil Procedure stand the E-Discovery Rules require companies to comply with civil litigation requests for legacy data as well as implement legal hold to ensure the appropriate preservation of data going forward. At first glance, it appears that the current e-discovery rules are potentially ripe for abuse, including submitting frivolous lawsuits that can cost the defendant organizations millions of dollars in personnel resources, time, and technical support costs, to an invasion of privacy of proprietary or confidential data under the guise of <b>legal</b> <b>disclosure.</b> And yet since it’s inception in 2006 it also seems that within most cases, the e-discovery rules were appropriately applied by reasonable judgments.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{strategic}} timing of corporate disclosures in the institutional context of China. It comprises three independent but linked studies which draw on both financial and psychological theories. The {{focus is on}} the Chinese setting as the unique regulations governing corporate disclosures enables managers to strategically time their disclosures of quarterly reports. The sample comprises 18273 observations from 2006 to 2012 which covers both A and B shares from the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. Firstly, under the Chinese booking system of quarterly report disclosure, I examine whether managers delay the disclosure of bad news relative to good news. The listed firms in China are required to book disclosure dates of quarterly reports before <b>legal</b> <b>disclosure</b> periods, and they are allowed to change the dates after the bookings have been made. Through this booking system, the advance and delay of quarterly report disclosures can be observed directly. Supporting prior literature, I find that managers advance their first booking disclosure dates if quarterly reports reveal good news, but delay them if quarterly reports reveal bad news. I further demonstrate that managers' preference for modifying of first booking dates as a timing strategy appears to occur when they have strong incentives to withhold their firm news and potentially gamble that the subsequent release of relative market conditions could turn in their favor. In line with the prediction of Acharya et al. (2011), my results suggest that managers tend to advance their first booking dates, when relative market conditions are bad. Conversely, they are likely to postpone them, when relative market conditions are good. The second study utilizes the Chinese overlapping <b>legal</b> <b>disclosure</b> period between an annual report of one year and the subsequent first quarterly report to test whether the nature of firm's news in uences the release sequence of the two financial information sources. Mental accounting theory suggests that individuals tend to integrate losses and segregate gains. In line with this theory, I find that managers are willing to release their annual report and subsequent first quarterly report simultaneously if both reports reveal bad news, but separately if both reports reveal good news. When two reports reveal conflicting information, managers are likely to make separate dis-closure, if the annual report reveals good news and the subsequent first quarterly report reveals bad news. In particular, I demonstrate that managers indeed achieve simultaneous and separate disclosure through amending the first booking dates of their annual report and subsequent first quarterly report. Baker and Wurgler (2007) suggest that both high proportions of retail investors and short sale constraints enable Chinese stock markets to be a natural experiment for investor sentiment studies. Therefore, utilizing Chinese data, in the final study, I investigate whether investor sentiment affects managers' decisions of quarterly report disclosures. Since the stock prices tend to be higher during high sentiment periods than low sentiment periods, managers may choose to accelerate the disclosure dates of their quarterly report during the high sentiment periods, conversely, decelerate them during the periods of low sentiment. The results support this and are especially pronounced for firms releasing bad news, who appear to (1) release their firm news earlier than firms with good news when sentiment is high and (2) delay quarterly report disclosures more than firms with good news when sentiment is low...|$|E

40|$|Purpose of the article: In the past, {{annual reports}} only include {{financial}} measures. More recently, this shareholder value {{approach has been}} criticized of leading to a strategic short-term orientation. Consequently, the use of strategic performance measurement systems (SPMSs), namely the Balanced Scorecard (BSC), is proposed to communicate non-financial measures to investors and stakeholders. Besides the distribution of critical information, the disclosure of non-financial measures should strengthen the employee's commitment to the long-term strategy. The purpose of the article is thus to reveal whether Austrian companies disclose their strategic performance measures in their annual reports. Methodology/methods: Two observation points, 2002 and 2012, were chosen to analyse the annual reports of companies listed on the ATX. This period of time allows to observe changes {{as well as new}} trends. The annual reports have been downloaded from the company’s homepage or received via email or post. A document and content analysis, followed by a frequency analysis, has been applied to identify several non-financial measures with regard to the following BSC derived perspectives: Customer perspective, internal business perspective and innovation and learning perspective. Scientific aim: The scientific aim of the following study is to examine the extent, to which non-financial performance measures are displayed in annual reports. Findings: The analysis of the annual reports showed a tremendous increase of non-financial measures in the time period between 2002 and 2012, which solely arose from the augmented disclosure activities of the innovation and learning perspective. On the other hand, the customer and internal perspective decreased in importance. Moreover, the top ten measures in 2002 have changed and are dominated by diversity and environmental issues in the year 2012. Conclusions: Similar findings in the literature as well as the influence of <b>legal</b> <b>disclosure</b> requirements are discussed. Possible limitations are the sole use of the Balanced Scorecard as a SPMS or the chosen time period of ten years...|$|E

Implementing mandatory disclosure requirements in Indonesia [...] Chapter IV. <b>Legal</b> non-compliance <b>disclosure</b> [...] Chapter V. Conclusion [...] Bibliography. In capital markets, disclosure {{is the main}} source of information for investors. One of the most important types of information in disclosure is information about a company’s legal non-compliance. Information about a company’s legal non-compliance is not only socially significant but also financially important as it may lead to hefty penalties, loss of contract and other economic effects. However, in contrast to financial information which is quantitatively measured, the consequences of non-compliance often involve a qualitative aspect making it difficult to articulate its materiality. This study is doctrinal legal research and it sets out to evaluate whether the enforcement by the Indonesian Financial Services Authority (OJK) of its <b>disclosure</b> policy on <b>legal</b> non-compliance is sufficient to protect the investing public. The study aims to mitigate the impact of information asymmetry due to incomplete <b>disclosure</b> of corporate <b>legal</b> non-compliance as well as to enhance corporate accountability to shareholders for company illegality. It argues that factors such as materiality, regulatory capture, and the roles of securities lawyers have been creating inconsistencies in OJK’s implementation of its <b>legal</b> non-compliance <b>disclosure</b> policy. The outcome of this study would be useful to articulate lessons for other developing capital markets, particularly those with conditions of legal uncertainty similar to those in Indonesia, in advancing the goal of disclosure.

40|$|The {{economic}} analysis of trade-secret protection has traditionally {{focused on the}} interests of companies to conceal information from competitors {{in order to gain}} a competitive advantage through trade-secret law. This has neglected cases in which the interest is not in concealing information from competitors, but from trading partners. We investigate the social efficiency effects of trade-secret protection in such cases. Many results from economic theory state that asymmetric information (and therefore also its legal protection) is socially undesirable since it leads to inefficient trade. At the same time, protecting private information might create incentives for socially desirable investments. We model this trade-off in a simple buyer-seller model and find that, indeed, trade-secret protection has ambiguous welfare effects. However, a simple, informationally undemanding rule, conditioning the applicability of legal protection on a minimum investment by the informed party to conceal the information, helps to apply trade-secret protection only when it increases welfare. This rationalizes important features of current <b>legal</b> practice. <b>disclosure</b> of information, hold-up problems, trade secrets...|$|R
