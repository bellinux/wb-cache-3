A surface analysis of the land use in the area defined is {{made on the basis of}} the applicable spatial implementation acts and a type of use according to the cadastral classification on the basis of information of land cadastre is formed. Land prices, contractual and advertised land price, were analyzed for the purpose of estimating the <b>land</b> <b>market</b> <b>value</b> planned for the purchase inside and the remaining surface outside the defined corridor. The analysis represents the baseline for land classifications for the purpose of estimating the land within a framework of the pre-investment study.

In the conclusion of the Bachelor degree we found out that we lack a suitable number of specified types of data to formulate the right evaluation methodology, especially information on contractual land prices at some stage of land development. On the basis of the estimated <b>land</b> <b>market</b> <b>value</b> for the potential construction of the public railway infrastructure on two different variants we found out that the most favorable variant of the planned route is next to the existing railway line.

40|$|New Zealand {{is both an}} Annex I Party to the UNFCCC, and an Annex B {{country of}} the Kyoto Protocol. By ratifying the latter, NZ has {{committed}} to reduce greenhouse gas emission to 1990 levels. The country should take domestic actions and can also use any of the Kyoto Protocol flexible mechanisms. Afforestation and reforestation on low carbon density land has been recognised as a carbon sink and hence a possible mitigation option for climate change. The current situation for New Zealand is that at least over the first commitment period (2008 - 2012) {{the country is in}} deficit, because emissions have continued to grow over the 1990 level, there is an increase in the deforestation rate and lower rates of new planting. The objective {{of this study is to}} analyse the potential of the New Zealand forest sector as an integrated system to mitigate climate change. It also analyses the impact of different mechanisms on potential area of new land planting, management of stands, and the supply, allocation, and demand of wood, and wood products. The New Zealand forest industry carbon balance (i. e net atmospheric exchange minus emissions) is modelled for different national estate scenarios, log allocation of harvested volume and residues used for bioenergy. The net present value of these scenarios is estimated and the economic viability assessed. The level of incentives needed to increase the returns to an economically viable level is estimated in term of carbon unit value ($/tC). Moreover the land use economics at a project level (<b>land</b> <b>market</b> <b>value</b> vs land expectation value) is assessed. Incentives needed in monetary terms and carbon value are also estimated. The implications of discounting carbon benefits are discussed. It was found that the carbon balance of the whole industry should be analysed for policy development on climate change mitigation options. New planting, longer rotation ages, avoiding deforestation, and allocating additional harvested volume to sawmills showed positive impact to the atmosphere. New planting appeared to be not economically viable, thus incentives are needed. It is acknowledged that, there are emissions from the sector that were not included, and that data and models used need further research to improve the accuracy of the results. Moreover, assumptions on the economic issues and an analysis of simultaneous implementation of more than one mitigation option would also improve the results...|$|E

40|$|Urban {{containment}} {{programs may}} be evaluated {{in terms of}} a theory unifying contributions from the economic, geographic and political science disciplines. The unified theory shows that successful programs will segment the urban-rural <b>land</b> <b>market,</b> remove speculative use value of rural land, and result in the urban <b>land</b> <b>market</b> <b>valuing</b> greenbelt proximity as an amenity. A general model to test urban containment programs against the unified theory is developed and then modified for application to Salem, Oregon. Results are fourfold. First, a gap in the locus of urban and rural land values at the UGB indicates that segmentation of the urban-rural <b>land</b> <b>market</b> is associated with urban containment policies. Second, the simultaneous effect of imposing a UGB proximate to urban development and subjecting rural land to conservancy zoning is to remove the speculative value component of rural land and reveal Sinclair 2 ̆ 7 s (1967) underlying convex quadratic agricultural use land value gradient. This finding is important in two respects: (a) it confirms the possibility of Sinclair 2 ̆ 7 s gradient, which has not been supported empirically hitherto, and (b) it suggests that a program 2 ̆ 7 s success in preserving greenbelt land solely for agricultural uses can be evidenced if Sinclair 2 ̆ 7 s gradient is revealed. Third, the conditions under which a program may fail to preserve rural land from speculative behavior will be evidenced by the traditional negatively sloping land value gradient. Fourth, where urban development is proximate to a UGB delineating greenbelts, the urban <b>land</b> <b>market</b> will <b>value</b> its proximity as an amenity. This finding is important in two respects: (a) it suggests that proximity to privately owned greenbelts may be valued as an amenity in the urban <b>land</b> <b>market,</b> a finding which has not been reported empirically hitherto, and (b) if an urban <b>land</b> <b>market</b> has confidence in the ability of an urban containment program to prevent sprawl into greenbelts, then it will treat greenbelt proximity as an amenity.

40|$|Nebraska {{agricultural}} land values rose sharply {{during the year}} ending February 1 st, 2007 according to the UNL Nebraska Farm Real Estate Survey. The all-land value increase was 14. 0 %, the largest annual percentage increase in 19 years. Sharply higher crop commodity prices {{towards the end of}} 2006, the result of a rapidly-expanding ethanol industry in the state, appeared to contribute greatly to the run-up in land values. In addition, potential for further irrigation development in some areas of the state led to spirited bidding for such land; while regions experiencing water restrictions had more muted value changes for the year. In such a dynamic market, it is reasonable to expect greater risk and uncertainty. Indeed, reporters, when asked to compare the next few years with current levels, did foresee greater risk and uncertainty ahead. This was true of future land value volatility, cash rent shifts, and income returns to land. In addition to current crop prices, purchase for farm expansion was cited as a strong contributor to <b>land</b> <b>market</b> <b>value</b> advances in the current market. Non-farmer investor interest and the associated opportunities for “ 1031 ” tax exchanges also continue to create upward pressures on land values according to survey reporters, but not to the extend of influence of recent years. Related to this reporter perspective was the greater incidence of purchases by active farmer/rancher buyers in 2006. For the actual reported sales for 2006, 71 % were purchased by active farmer/ranchers as compared with 61 % in the previous year. For cropland, cash rental rates for 2007 rose sharply across the state with increases generally in the 10 to 12 % range. These higher income earnings associated with cropland tended to parallel the value advances, thus leading to estimated net rates of return being essentially unchanged from year earlier levels. For several years, these net rates of return had gradually declined. The 2007 rents for pasture were essentially similar to year-earlier levels as the cattle sector experienced some reduced profit potential in 2006. Since grazing land values climbed during the year, the net rate of return on pasture land continued to decline. A majority of reporters in the early-year 2007 survey saw the level of real estate sales activity in 2007 being similar to 2006 levels; although of reporters expecting some change in the number of sales, the number expecting some increase outnumbered those anticipating a decrease by nearly three to one. As for anticipated value changes during 2007, a very strong majority of reporters looked for continuing advances in every region of the state. Overall, nearly nine out of every ten reporters expected further appreciation in {{agricultural land}} values in 2007, averaging about 9 percent. In a special mid-year 2007 electronic survey of a smaller sample of respondents, nearly all reported that values for dryland cropland and irrigated cropland had climbed further since the first of the year. The average reported increase was more than 10 %. A slight majority saw increases in grazing land values (also more than 10 %) while nearly half saw steady values...|$|E

The article is intended to introduce the basic characteristics of Slovenian rural <b>land</b> <b>market</b> in the period 2001 – 2005. The main stress is on the location characteristics of land, as geographical location is the basic characteristic making the land different from other assets on the market. In the article, {{the impact of the}} accessibility of plots to the central places of Slovenia on rural <b>land</b> <b>market</b> has been evaluated. The hypothesis has been emphasized that the <b>market</b> <b>value</b> of rural <b>land</b> depends on the accessibility to the National Development Axes and along that axes tothe central places of a higher level in Slovenia.

These factors collectively facilitate the sub-division and conversion of working lands (i. e., ownership fragmentation). As such, ownership fragmentation can have serious implications for how landscapes are managed, given varying management objectives among landowners and the external pressures they exert on each other. While most land fragmentation studies are conducted within small spatial scales, focusing on the spatial discontinuity of land or habitat, ownership fragmentation focuses instead on the human aspect of landscapes. I used data reported by the United States Department of Agriculture?s Census of Agriculture and the United States Census Bureau to evaluate ownership fragmentation metrics and social drivers of land ownership change across a large geographic region. I used these data to quantify ownership fragmentation and explanatory variables that are hypothesized to explain variation in ownership fragmentation (e. g., total population, asset value per acre), and to analyze the systematic forces that influence ownership fragmentation of working lands across the southeastern United States. I identified important trends and relationships between ownership fragmentation, population, and land value across the southeastern United States {{that can be used}} to inform public and private decision makers, and to evaluate land use policies in light of conservation and natural resource policy efforts to maintain critical resources and ecosystem services delivered from privately owned land...|$|R

40|$|Summary Even in {{the absence}} of formal <b>land</b> <b>markets,</b> {{estimated}} <b>values</b> on agricultural frontiers of the Brazilian Amazon reflect the value-adding characteristics of the land. Understanding these characteristics provides important insights to the incentives (or dis-incentives) to protect tropical forests and reduce deforestation. A hedonic model is used to identify characteristics determining smallholder land values on the Amazon frontier. Years on the lot, area under agricultural production, and house values were found to add value; while distance from the nearest city and area under forest decreased values. Characteristics that do not appear to significantly affect land value include pasture area and the claim to hold definitive title. By not adding significantly to land values, pasture may be used to establish property rights rather than to increase land value through positive rents. Our results also confirm the underutilization of the forest resource by smallholders. Brazil Amazon smallholder land value hedonic model...|$|R

The number of random failure events for each kind of component over the entire service life of a transmission line can only be predicted on a probabilistic basis: its expected value is estimated by making use of the relevant mean failure rates from recent statistical surveys. The entire procedure is shown by carrying out a particular case study as an example; the break-even point between the OHL-UGC overall costs, corresponding to a typical rural <b>land</b> Italian <b>market</b> <b>value</b> wx= 26. 9 €/m 2, is identified. Nonetheless, the method may be widely applied to any type of OHL–UGC comparison...|$|R
