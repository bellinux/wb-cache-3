5|$|A {{sequel to}} the game, Ace Attorney Investigations 2, was {{released}} in Japan on February 3, 2011. There are currently no plans for Capcom to release it internationally, but a fan translation has been made and released on the internet. In July 2013, Eshiro {{said that he and}} Yamazaki would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a third Investigations game, and that he intended to secure the needed Capcom personnel and plan everything out in the future, but that he could not make any promises.|$|E
5|$|The episode makes {{references}} to Family Guy itself. When Bonnie, Lois and Cleveland's new girlfriend come to dance at The Drunken Clam, they state {{that they would}} <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the bar their place to hang out, after Peter grabs Joe's gun and kills himself. It turns out that this was only Peter's imagination as he snaps out of it when Joe starts talking to him; Peter answers {{that he was having}} a Scrubs fantasy moment. Quagmire responds to Peter's moment by stating that Scrubs is the best show people are not watching. Cleveland replies that he hates shows that leave the story for a gag or joke, referring to the numerous cutaways Scrubs and Family Guy contain. While in the hospital Peter realizes that Mr. Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman have a similar voice, then Mr. Pewterschmidt comes into the room and they both start talking about how their voices sound alike; this is a reference to the show's creator Seth MacFarlane as he voices both characters.|$|E

25|$|The {{islands are}} famous among birdwatchers {{for their ability}} to attract rare birds from all corners of the globe. The peak time of year for this is {{generally}} in October when {{it is not unusual for}} several of the rarest birds in Europe to share this archipelago. One reason for the success of these islands in producing rarities is the extensive coverage these islands get from birdwatchers, but archipelagos are often favoured by rare birds which <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> landfall and eat there before continuing their journeys and often arrive on far flung islands first.|$|E
25|$|Viguié's {{interest}} in the motion picture industry came about in 1901, after viewing the first silent film, an Eduardo Hervet presentation, exhibited in Teatro La Perla in Ponce. During a trip to Paris, France, he witnessed Auguste and Louis Lumière's first public motion picture exhibition at the Caf-Les Capucinos. Upon his return to Puerto Rico he found {{a job as a}} movie projectionist at the Teatro Habana in his hometown. Viguié was inspired by what he saw and decided that he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> movies himself. In 1911, he sent one of his friends to France to purchase a Pathe camera with the money that he had earned.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the prosecutor's closing argument, Judge Akubzhanov invited Chikatilo back into the courtroom, before formally asking him whether he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a final statement on his own behalf. In response, Chikatilo simply sat mute. Judge Akubzhanov then announced an initial date of 15 September for himself and the two official jurors to review the evidence and pass final sentence upon Chikatilo. (This date was later postponed until 14 October.) As court announced recess, the brother of Lyudmila Alekseyeva, a 17-year-old girl killed by Chikatilo in August 1984, threw a heavy chunk of metal at Chikatilo, hitting him in the chest. When security tried to arrest the young man, other victims' relatives shielded him.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} a {{critical}} success, though some critics wondered about the social impact of a character that they saw as sympathetic.

I find it much more challenging to make songs that are pop songs, to make happy songs, and that's why I like to do it.
