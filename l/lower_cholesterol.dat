5|$|Heterozygous FH is {{normally}} treated with statins, bile acid sequestrants, or other lipid lowering agents that <b>lower</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels. New cases are generally offered genetic counseling. Homozygous FH often {{does not respond}} to medical therapy and may require other treatments, including LDL apheresis (removal of LDL in a method similar to dialysis) and occasionally liver transplantation.|$|E
5|$|FH {{is usually}} treated with statins. Statins act by {{inhibiting}} the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-CoA-reductase) in the liver. In response, the liver produces more LDL receptors, which remove circulating LDL from the blood. Statins effectively <b>lower</b> <b>cholesterol</b> and LDL levels, although sometimes add-on therapy with other drugs is required, such as bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine or colestipol), nicotinic acid preparations or fibrates. Control of {{other risk factors}} for cardiovascular disease is required, as risk remains somewhat elevated even when cholesterol levels are controlled. Professional guidelines recommend {{that the decision to}} treat a person with FH with statins should not be based on the usual risk prediction tools (such as those derived from the Framingham Heart Study), as they are likely to underestimate the risk of cardiovascular disease; unlike the rest of the population, FH have had high levels of cholesterol since birth, probably increasing their relative risk. Prior to the introduction of the statins, clofibrate (an older fibrate that often caused gallstones), probucol (especially in large xanthomas) and thyroxine were used to reduce LDL cholesterol levels.|$|E

25|$|A diet high in {{fruits and}} {{vegetables}} decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease and death. Evidence suggests that the Mediterranean diet may improve cardiovascular results. There is also evidence that a Mediterranean diet may be better than a low-fat diet in bringing about long-term changes to cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., <b>lower</b> <b>cholesterol</b> level and blood pressure).|$|E
25|$|After {{reports of}} {{research}} finding that dietary oats can help <b>lower</b> <b>cholesterol,</b> the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a final rule that allows food companies to make health claims on food labels of foods that contain soluble fiber from whole oats (oat bran, oat flour and rolled oats), noting that 3.0grams of soluble fiber daily from these foods {{may reduce the}} risk of heart disease. To qualify for the health claim, the food that contains the oats must provide at least 0.75grams of soluble fiber per serving.|$|E

500|$|Another {{chemical}} {{extracted from}} the species was an acidic polysaccharide (made up of mostly mannose, glucose, glucuronic acid and xylose) which showed anticoagulant properties. The article concluded that [...] "the polysaccharides from these mushrooms may constitute {{a new source of}} compounds with action on coagulation, platelet aggregation and, perhaps, on thrombosis". Another study reported that the species may be effective in stopping platelet binding in vitro, with possible uses regarding hypercholesterolemia. Research has shown that A.auricula-judae can be used to <b>lower</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels generally, and, in particular, is one of two fungi shown to reduce the level of bad cholesterol.|$|E
2500|$|Breastfeeding may {{decrease}} {{the risk of}} cardiovascular disease in later life, as indicated by <b>lower</b> <b>cholesterol</b> and C-reactive protein levels in breastfed adult women.

2500|$|Prevention is {{generally}} by eating a healthy diet, exercise, not smoking, {{and maintaining a}} normal weight. Treatment of established disease may include medications to <b>lower</b> <b>cholesterol</b> such as statins, blood pressure medication, or medications that decrease clotting such as aspirin. A number of procedures may also be carried out such as percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft, or carotid endarterectomy.|$|E

2500|$|A {{class of}} drugs widely used to <b>lower</b> <b>cholesterol</b> are the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, for example atorvastatin. [...] These were {{developed}} from mevastatin, a polyketide {{produced by the}} fungus Penicillium citrinum. [...] Finally, a number natural product drugs are used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure. [...] These include the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril.

2500|$|As of 2016, {{there are}} at least 30 brands available. Many of these avoid the FDA {{restriction}} by not having any appreciable monacolin content. Their labels and websites say no more than [...] "fermented according to traditional Asian methods" [...] or [...] "similar to that used in culinary applications." [...] The labeling on these products often says nothing about cholesterol. If they do not contain lovastatin, do not claim to contain lovastatin, and do not make a claim to <b>lower</b> <b>cholesterol,</b> they are not subject to FDA action. Two reviews confirm that the monacolin content of red yeast rice dietary supplements can vary over a wide range, with some containing negligible monacolins.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{anti-infective}} medications {{have been}} derived from fungi including penicillin and the cephalosporins (antibacterial drugs from Penicillium chrysogenum and Cephalosporium acremonium, respectively) and griseofulvin (an antifungal drug from Penicillium griseofulvum). [...] Other medicinally useful fungal metabolites include lovastatin (from Pleurotus ostreatus), {{which became a}} lead {{for a series of}} drugs that <b>lower</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels, cyclosporin (from Tolypocladium inflatum), which is used to suppress the immune response after organ transplant operations, and ergometrine (from Claviceps spp.), which acts as a vasoconstrictor, and is used to prevent bleeding after childbirth. Asperlicin (from Aspergillus alliaceus) is another example. [...] Asperlicin is a novel antagonist of cholecystokinin, a neurotransmitter thought to be involved in panic attacks, and could potentially be used to treat anxiety.|$|E

2500|$|Up to 90% of {{cardiovascular}} disease may be preventable if established risk factors are avoided. Medical management of atherosclerosis first involves modification to risk factors–for example, via smoking cessation and diet restrictions. Additionally, a controlled exercise program combats atherosclerosis by improving circulation and functionality of the vessels. Exercise {{is also used to}} manage weight in patients who are obese, lower blood pressure, and decrease cholesterol. Often lifestyle modification is combined with medication therapy. For example, statins help to <b>lower</b> <b>cholesterol,</b> antiplatelet medications like aspirin help to prevent clots, and a variety of antihypertensive medications are routinely used to control blood pressure. [...] If the combined efforts of risk factor modification and medication therapy are not sufficient to control symptoms, or fight imminent threats of ischemic events, a physician may resort to interventional or surgical procedures to correct the obstruction.|$|E
2500|$|In hens, {{tamarind}} {{has been}} found to <b>lower</b> <b>cholesterol</b> in their serum, and in the yolks of the eggs they laid. Due to a lack of available human clinical trials, there is insufficient evidence to recommend tamarind for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia or diabetes. Different parts of tamarind (T. indica) are recognized for their various medicinal properties. A previous study reported that the seed, leaf, leaf veins, fruit pulp and skin extracts of tamarind possessed high phenolic content and antioxidant activities. The presence of lupanone and lupeol, [...] catechin, epicatechin, quercetin and isorhamnetin [...] in the leaf extract could have contributed towards the diverse range of the medicinal activities. On the other hand, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) analyses revealed that tamarind seeds contained catechin, procyanidin B2, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, chloramphenicol, myricetin, morin, quercetin, apigenin and kaempferol. The treatment of tamarind leaves on liver HepG2 cells significantly regulated the expression of genes and proteins involved with consequential impact on the coagulation system, cholesterol biosynthesis, xenobiotic metabolism signaling and antimicrobial response.|$|E
2500|$|One {{way to see}} {{atheroma}} is {{the very}} invasive and costly IVUS ultrasound technology; it gives us the precise volume of the inside intima plus the central media layers of about [...] of artery length. [...] Unfortunately, it gives no information about the structural strength of the artery. Angiography does not visualize atheroma; it only makes the blood flow within blood vessels visible. Alternative methods that are non or less physically invasive and less expensive per individual test have been used and are continuing to be developed, such as those using computed tomography (CT; led by the electron beam tomography form, given its greater speed) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The most promising since the early 1990s has been EBT, detecting calcification within the atheroma before most individuals start having clinically recognized symptoms and debility. Interestingly, statin therapy (to <b>lower</b> <b>cholesterol)</b> does not slow the speed of calcification as determined by CT scan. [...] MRI coronary vessel wall imaging, although currently limited to research studies, has demonstrated the ability to detect vessel wall thickening in asymptomatic high risk individuals. [...] As a non-invasive, ionising radiation free technique, MRI based techniques could have future uses in monitoring disease progression and regression. [...] Most visualization techniques are used in research, they are not widely available to most patients, have significant technical limitations, have not been widely accepted and generally {{are not covered by}} medical insurance carriers.|$|E
