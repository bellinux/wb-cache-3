50|$|This <b>latch</b> <b>circuit</b> {{is similar}} to an astable multivibrator, except {{that there is no}} charge or {{discharge}} time, due to the absence of capacitors. Hence, when the circuit is switched on, if Q1 is on, its collector is at 0 V. As a result, Q2 gets switched off. This results in more than half +V volts being applied to R4 causing current into the base of Q1, thus keeping it on. Thus, the circuit remains stable in a single state continuously. Similarly, Q2 remains on continuously, if it happens to get switched on first.|$|E
40|$|A {{gate drive}} <b>latching</b> <b>circuit</b> for an {{auxiliary}} resonant commutation circuit for a power switching inverter includes a current monitor circuit providing a current signal {{to a pair}} of analog comparators to implement latching of one of a pair of auxiliary switching devices which are used to provide commutation current for commutating switching inverters in the circuit. Each of the pair of comparators feeds a <b>latching</b> <b>circuit</b> which responds to an active one of the comparators for latching the associated gate drive circuit for one of the pair of auxiliary commutating switches. An initial firing signal is applied to each of the commutating switches to gate each into conduction and the resulting current is monitored to determine current direction and therefore the one of the switches which is carrying current. The comparator provides a latching signal to the one of the auxiliary power switches which is actually conducting current and latches that particular power switch into an on state for the duration of current through the device.

50|$|Magnetic {{core memory}} was the {{standard}} form of memory system until displaced by solid-state memory in integrated circuits, {{starting in the}} early 1970s. Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) allowed replacement of a 4 or 6-transistor <b>latch</b> <b>circuit</b> by a single transistor for each memory bit, greatly increasing memory density {{at the cost of}} volatility. Data was stored in the tiny capacitance of each transistor, and had to be periodically refreshed every few milliseconds before the charge could leak away. The Toshiba Toscal BC-1411 electronic calculator, which was introduced in 1965, used a form of DRAM built from discrete components. DRAM was then developed by Robert H. Dennard in 1968.|$|E
50|$|One might {{suppose that}} the work of {{designing}} an adder stage is now complete, but we haven't addressed the fact that all 3 of the input variables have to appear in both their direct and complement forms. There's no difficulty about the addends x and y in this respect, because they are static throughout the addition and thus are normally held in latch circuits that routinely have both direct and complement outputs. (The simplest <b>latch</b> <b>circuit</b> made of NOR gates is a pair of gates cross-coupled to make a flip-flop: the output of each is wired as one of the inputs to the other.) There is also no need to create the complement form of the sum u. However, the carry out of one bit position must be passed as the carry into the next bit position in both direct and complement forms. The most straightforward {{way to do this is}} to pass co through a 1-input NOR gate and label the output co, but that would add a gate delay in the worst possible place, slowing down the rippling of carries from right to left. An additional 4-input NOR gate building the canonical form of co (out of the opposite minterms as co) solves this problem.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Level-sensitive {{transparent}} latches {{are widely}} used in high-performance sequential circuit designs.

In this paper, we present the first algorithm to compute such probability based on block-based statistical timing analysis that, first, covers all cycles through a structural graph traversal, and second, terminates within a polynomial number of statistical “sum ” and “max ” operations.

40|$|A custom {{laboratory}} {{electronic timer}} circuit measures the durations of successive cycles of nominally highly stable input clock signals {{in as many}} as eight channels, for the purpose of statistically quantifying the small instabilities of these signals. The measurement data generated by this timer are sent to a personal computer running software that integrates the measurements to form a phase residual for each channel and uses the phase residuals to compute Allan variances for each channel. (The Allan variance is a standard statistical measure of instability of a clock signal.) Like other laboratory clock-cycle-measuring circuits, this timer utilizes an externally generated reference clock signal having a known frequency (100 MHz) much higher than the frequencies of the input clock signals (between 100 and 120 Hz). It counts the number of reference-clock cycles that occur between successive rising edges of each input clock signal of interest, thereby affording a measurement of the input clock-signal period to within the duration (10 ns) of one reference clock cycle. Unlike typical prior laboratory clock-cycle-measuring circuits, this timer does not skip some cycles of the input clock signals. The non-cycle-skipping feature is an important advantage because in applications that involve integration of measurements over long times for characterizing nominally highly stable clock signals, skipping cycles can degrade accuracy. The timer includes a field-programmable gate array that functions as a 20 -bit counter running at the reference clock rate of 100 MHz. The timer also includes eight 20 -bit <b>latching</b> <b>circuits</b> - one for each channel - at the output terminals of the counter. Each transition of an input signal from low to high causes the corresponding <b>latching</b> <b>circuit</b> to <b>latch</b> the count at that instant. Each such transition also sets a status flip-flop circuit to indicate the presence of the latched count. A microcontroller reads the values of all eight status flipflops and then reads the latched count for each channel for which the flip-flop indicates the presence of a count. Reading the count for each channel automatically causes the flipflop of that channel to be reset. The microcontroller places the counts in time order, identifies the channel number for each count, and transmits these data to the personal computer...|$|R
