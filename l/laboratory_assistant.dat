5|$|First {{to arrive}} was Otto Frisch and Ernest Titterton {{and his wife}} Peggy, who reached Los Alamos on 13 December 1943. At Los Alamos Frisch {{continued}} his work on critical mass studies, for which Titterton developed electronic circuitry for high voltage generators, X-ray generators, timers and firing circuits. Peggy Titterton, a trained physics and metallurgy <b>laboratory</b> <b>assistant,</b> {{was one of the}} few women working at Los Alamos in a technical role. Chadwick arrived on 12 January 1944, but only stayed for a few months before returning to Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|He briefly had {{jobs as a}} <b>laboratory</b> <b>assistant</b> and {{a railway}} clerk in St Helens. During this period he {{attended}} draughting classes at the YMCA and considered a career as an engineer in Sir Douglas Fox's practice. In 1891 he began working for his brother-in-law, David Frederick Green, a land surveyor and architect in Bolton. In April 1892 he was articled to Manchester architect Everard W. Leeson and, while training with him, also studied at the Manchester School of Art (1893–94) and Manchester Technical School (1894–96).|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} around 60 students, Bayliss stimulated the nerves with {{electricity}} {{for half an}} hour, {{but was unable to}} demonstrate his point. The dog was then handed to a student, Henry Dale, a future Nobel laureate, who removed the dog's pancreas, then killed him with a knife through the heart. This became a point of embarrassment during the libel trial, when Bayliss's <b>laboratory</b> <b>assistant,</b> Charles Scuttle, testified that the dog had been killed with chloroform or the ACE mixture. After Scuttle's testimony Dale told the court that he had, in fact, used a knife.|$|E
30|$|In summary, {{considering}} the laboratory practice {{standards and the}} VET program curricula, we identified procedures that are performed daily by <b>laboratory</b> <b>assistants</b> in biology {{as well as in}} medicine. These common procedures allowed us to use PROKLAS for the assessment of professional knowledge of laboratory tasks of VET students in biology and medicine (e.g., biological technicians, biological <b>laboratory</b> <b>assistants,</b> and medical <b>laboratory</b> <b>assistants,</b> respectively).|$|R
30|$|Ever since fictitious {{shows like}} Crime Scene Investigation flooded {{television}} channels, everyone {{is aware of}} scientific <b>laboratory</b> <b>assistants</b> and forensic technicians working in laboratories who apply various scientific techniques to track down criminals. The popularity of these shows has impacted our perception of the abilities of <b>laboratory</b> <b>assistants</b> (Podlas 2006). While most of these shows are fictional, the professions of the scientific <b>laboratory</b> <b>assistants</b> in medicine and biology enacted are real. In this study, {{we focus on the}} professional knowledge of <b>laboratory</b> <b>assistants</b> in biology and medicine that is required to perform their daily laboratory work. Although we focus specifically on the German education system, the laboratory duties are similar across countries, and our study would be of interest to a wider audience.|$|R
30|$|Currently, PROKLAS {{is being}} {{implemented}} in the longitudinal large-scale assessment project “Mathematics and Science Competencies in Vocational Education and Training” (ManKobE). ManKobE is conducted as a statewide effort in Germany to empirically assess the competencies in mathematics and sciences in several VET programs (e.g., electrical engineering, car mechatronics, industrial clerks, <b>laboratory</b> <b>assistants</b> in chemistry, and <b>laboratory</b> <b>assistants).</b> In this context, PROKLAS {{is being used to}} assess and compare the learning outcomes of the professional knowledge of laboratory tasks of <b>laboratory</b> <b>assistants</b> trained either in both kinds of school-based VET programs or in the dual system.|$|R
5|$|Browne {{was born}} in Melbourne to Linda and Alex Browne, the second of three brothers. His father was a printer and Browne took his {{elementary}} education at Chatham Public School, {{before moving on to}} Box Hill High School and later took his university education at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT). While he was at university, he also worked in Sunshine as a <b>laboratory</b> <b>assistant</b> at Spaldings. At the age of 20, he graduated from RMIT and took a job at the State Electricity Commission, where he worked for over 35 years continuously since then, always riding his bicycle to work, a daily journey of around 15km.|$|E
5|$|Curie and {{her husband}} {{declined}} to go to Stockholm to receive the prize in person; they were too busy with their work, and Pierre, who disliked public ceremonies, was feeling increasingly ill. As Nobel laureates were required to deliver a lecture, the Curies finally undertook the trip in 1905. The award money allowed the Curies to hire their first <b>laboratory</b> <b>assistant.</b> Following the award of the Nobel Prize, and galvanized by an offer from the University of Geneva, which offered Pierre a position, the University of Paris gave Pierre a professorship and the chair of physics, although the Curies still {{did not have a}} proper laboratory. Upon Pierre's complaint, the University of Paris relented and agreed to furnish a new laboratory, but it would not be ready until 1906.|$|E
5|$|Historian Ruth Brandon in {{an article}} for the New Scientist noted that William Huggins, Serjeant Cox, Crooke's wife and daughter, his <b>laboratory</b> <b>assistant,</b> and a Mrs Humphrey were all present during the Crookes {{experiments}} with Home. However, Barry Wiley has written that when Crookes published his report on the experiments in the Quarterly Journal of Science in 1871 {{he did not mention}} all the names of the observers present in the room. Wiley has stated that four females were present during the experiments as was Crookes' brother and the original report by Crookes did not refer to any spirits but many years later in 1889 he revealed in his Notes of séances with D. D. Home the names of the observers and claimed Home was in communication with spirits.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Laboratory</b> <b>assistants</b> {{in biology}} and {{medicine}} {{play a central}} role in the operation of laboratories in hospitals, research institutes, and industries. Their daily work routine is characterized by dealing with molecular structures/chemical substances (i. e. biochemistry) as well as cell cultures (i. e. cell biology). In both these fields of biochemistry and cell biology, <b>laboratory</b> <b>assistants</b> rely on knowledge about three laboratory tasks: responsible action, data management, and laboratory techniques. Focusing on these laboratory tasks, we developed a test instrument measuring the professional knowledge of prospective <b>laboratory</b> <b>assistants</b> (acronym: PROKLAS) about biochemistry and cell biology. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) indicates that the test developed allows us to measure the professional knowledge of <b>laboratory</b> <b>assistants</b> in biochemistry and cell biology as two empirically separable constructs among <b>laboratory</b> <b>assistants.</b> CFA with covariates widely confirms the validity of PROKLAS in its respective subscales. Firstly, VET-related covariates predicted biochemistry and cell biology scores of students considerably better compared to the covariates related to general secondary school. Secondly, general biological knowledge predicted biochemistry and cell biology scores of PROKLAS. Finally, VET students’ self-efficacy in laboratory tasks and their opportunities to learn laboratory tasks are positively correlated to achievement in PROKLAS. However, we found a similar relationship for self-efficacy in English too. (IPN/Orig. ...|$|R
5|$|In March 1801, Frederick Accum {{was offered}} a {{position}} at the Royal Institution in Ablemarle Street, a research institute founded two years earlier by Count Rumford. Accepting the position, he began as <b>laboratory</b> <b>assistant</b> to Humphry Davy, who had been hired {{at the same time}} as director of the laboratory, and would later become the president of the Royal Society. Accum’s employment at the Royal came to an end in September 1803. His biographer, R. J. Cole, speculates this change was connected with the simultaneous departure of Count Rumford for employment in Paris. Rumford had been the driving force behind securing a position for Accum.|$|E
5|$|He {{received}} the visa in August 1939 and sailed out of Norway on 19 August on the SS Stavangerfjord, the last ship {{to leave for}} the United States before the war began on 3 September. He began teaching at The New School, where he remained until May 1941, living first at 7502 Kessel Street, Forest Hills, Queens, where he conducted experiments on mice with cancer, injecting them with bions. He built a small Faraday cage to examine the vapors and lights he said the bions were producing. In October 1939 his secretary Gertrud Gaasland introduced him to Ilse Ollendorf, 29 years old at the time. Reich was still in love with Lindenberg, but Ollendorf started organizing his life for him, becoming his bookkeeper and <b>laboratory</b> <b>assistant.</b> They began living together in the Kessel Street house on Christmas Day 1939. She was eight weeks pregnant, but according to Turner he insisted that she have an abortion. Five years later, in 1944, they had a son, Peter, and were married in 1946.|$|E

40|$|A {{standard}} of practice {{is defined as}} the desired and achievable performance level against which actual performance can be judged; it provides a benchmark for evaluating acceptable performance levels. CSMLS Standards of Practice are designed to measure the accuracy and quality of individual performance and to provide the expectations associated with professionalism for medical <b>laboratory</b> <b>assistants</b> (MLAs); they represent the minimum national standards for CSMLS-certified MLAs across Canada. Employers utilize this framework to establish specific workplace responsibilities and to develop job descriptions, policies and procedures. The CSMLS Medical <b>Laboratory</b> <b>Assistants</b> Competency Profile establishes the scope of practice for CSMLS-certified MLAs; it restricts CSMLS-certified MLAs to performing only those duties specifically outlined within that competency profile.
