5|$|After the Georgia kickoff, Glennon {{was again}} intercepted by Tony Taylor, who earned his second {{interception}} {{on the day}} and created Glennon's third turnover. Taylor returned the ball 16yards to the Tech one-yard <b>line,</b> <b>setting</b> up an easy touchdown for the Bulldogs. With 6:54 remaining, Georgia took a 31–21 lead over Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Smith fumbling the {{football}} with Oakland in scoring position. New York defensive end Gerry Philbin recovered the football at the Jets' 3-yard <b>line</b> <b>setting</b> up a 97-yard drive, consisting entirely of two Namath passes to Don Maynard, who {{was covered by}} Raiders' rookie cornerback George Atkinson. The 50-yard touchdown pass followed a 47-yard throw, and gave the Jets a 26–22 lead. Turner added another field goal to the Jets' total, giving them a 29–22 lead. The Raiders promptly responded with Lamonica orchestrating an 88-yard drive that ended with a 22-yard pass to receiver Fred Biletnikoff with less than four minutes remaining in the game, tying the contest.|$|E

25|$|Midway {{through the}} first quarter, the Seahawks drove 57 yards in five plays, {{featuring}} a 28-yard reception by Seneca Wallace, and scored with quarterback Matt Hasselbeck's 17-yard touchdown pass to Jerramy Stevens. Then three plays after the ensuing kickoff, linebacker Lofa Tatupu intercepted a pass from Jake Delhomme and returned it 22 yards to the Panthers 20-yard <b>line,</b> <b>setting</b> up a field goal from Josh Brown. The next time Carolina got the ball, Delhomme was intercepted again, this time by Marquand Manuel, who returned it 32 yards to the Panthers 17-yard <b>line,</b> <b>setting</b> up Alexander's 1-yard touchdown run that increased Seattle's lead to 17–0 on the first play of the second quarter. The Panthers eventually cut the score to 17–7 on Steve Smith's 59-yard punt return for a touchdown with 9:56 {{left in the first}} half.|$|E

40|$|Over any field K, {{there is}} a {{bijection}} between regular spreads of the projective space PG(3, K) and 0 -secant lines of the Klein quadric in PG(5, K). Under this bijection, regular parallelisms of PG(3, K) correspond to hyperflock determining <b>line</b> <b>sets</b> (hfd <b>line</b> <b>sets)</b> {{with respect to the}} Klein quadric. An hfd <b>line</b> <b>set</b> is defined to be pencilled if it is composed of pencils of lines. We present a construction of pencilled hfd <b>line</b> <b>sets,</b> which is then shown to determine all such sets. Based on these results, we describe the corresponding regular parallelisms. These are also termed as being pencilled. Any Clifford parallelism is regular and pencilled. From this, we derive necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions for the existence of pencilled hfd <b>line</b> <b>sets...</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{the fourth}} quarter, Houston {{defensive}} back Terry Hoage intercepted a pass from Montana at the Chiefs 25-yard <b>line,</b> <b>setting</b> up Del Greco's 43-yard field goal {{to make the}} score 13–7. But Kansas City quickly stormed back to take their first lead of the game, scoring in just three plays: a 22-yard completion from Montana to Cash, a 38-yard pass interference penalty against Houston, and Montana's 11-yard touchdown pass to Birden. Then on the first play of Houston's ensuing drive, Thomas forced a fumble from Moon that defensive lineman Dan Saleaumua recovered on the Oilers 13-yard <b>line,</b> <b>setting</b> up Montana's 18-yard touchdown pass to Davis. Moon then led the Oilers 80 yards with eight consecutive completions, including a 23-yard catch by Jeffires, to score on wide receiver Ernest Givins' 7-yard touchdown reception, making the score 21–20 with 3:35 left. But the Chiefs responded with a critical 41-yard completion from Montana to Cash on third and 1, setting up Marcus Allen's game clinching 21-yard touchdown run.|$|E

On Carolina's next possession, {{they were forced to}} punt, but New York safety Gibril Wilson muffed the kick and Panthers defensive back Dante Wesley recovered the ball at the Giants 15-yard <b>line,</b> <b>setting</b> up a 31-yard Kasay field goal to increase the lead to 10–0.|$|E
25|$|The misery would {{continue}} for Los Angeles {{in the second}} half, as their first three drives ended with interceptions.

5000|$|Especially tall fly towers pose {{a balance}} problem for {{standard}} counterweight <b>line</b> <b>sets.</b> As a <b>line</b> <b>set</b> is lowered to the stage, {{the weight of}} the lift lines is added to the total weight of the <b>line</b> <b>set</b> that a rigger must be able to control. For example, a batten with 6 lift lines of ¼" [...] aircraft cable that travels 50 feet effectively weighs about 40 pounds more when flown in than when it is flown out. To address this issue, a compensating mechanism may be added to the counterweight system. Either chain or thick wire-rope may be used.|$|R
25|$|The Falcons {{won their}} first playoff game in team history after they overcame a 13–0 deficit by scoring 2 {{touchdowns in the}} final 5 minutes of the game.
