5|$|The {{earliest}} electrical {{application of}} SiC was in <b>lightning</b> <b>arresters</b> in electric power systems. These devices must exhibit high resistance until the voltage across them reaches a certain threshold VT {{at which point}} their resistance must drop to a lower level and maintain this level until the applied voltage drops below VT.|$|E
5|$|It was {{recognized}} {{early on that}} SiC had such a voltage-dependent resistance, and so columns of SiC pellets were connected between high-voltage power lines and the earth. When a lightning strike to the line raises the line voltage sufficiently, the SiC column will conduct, allowing strike current to pass harmlessly to the earth instead of along the power line. Such SiC columns proved to conduct significantly at normal power-line operating voltages and thus had {{to be placed in}} series with a spark gap. This spark gap is ionized and rendered conductive when lightning raises the voltage of the power line conductor, thus effectively connecting the SiC column between the power conductor and the earth. Spark gaps used in <b>lightning</b> <b>arresters</b> are unreliable, either failing to strike an arc when needed or failing to turn off afterwards, in the latter case due to material failure or contamination by dust or salt. Usage of SiC columns was originally intended to eliminate the need for the spark gap in a lightning arrester. Gapped SiC <b>lightning</b> <b>arresters</b> were used as lightning-protection tool and sold under GE and Westinghouse brand names, among others. The gapped SiC arrester has been largely displaced by no-gap varistors that use columns of zinc oxide pellets.|$|E

To protected these equipments and for stability purpose, over-voltages and over currents protection are important to consider. Lightning {{is one of the}} most serious causes of over-voltage. If the power equipments especially at outdoor substation are not protected, the over-voltage will cause burning of insulation. <b>Lightning</b> <b>arrester</b> can protect the damages of equipments. This paper describes the <b>arrester</b> type, <b>lightning</b> terminal and earthing plan of Dagon East substation in Myanmar.

Most of substation equipments are designed to match with the insulation coordination. If the insulation equipments are higher, the cost is also high. So, to relax this, the <b>lightning</b> <b>arrester</b> must be put in front of the protected equipments and protected zone.
