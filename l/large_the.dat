5|$|Bloc Party {{commissioned}} Silent Alarm Remixed to {{show that}} remixes and dance music were relevant to the band and to the rock landscape at <b>large.</b> <b>The</b> band members gave each of the original tracks {{to a number of}} musicians from different genres; Ladytron, Four Tet, and Nick Zinner were amongst those who reworked the songs. Critics often considered the record as showcasing the potential high quality of remix albums, although some reviewers treated it as disjunct and a poor marketing decision.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{it is not}} only males that are ousted from their pride to become nomads, {{although}} most females certainly do remain with their birth pride. However, when the pride becomes too <b>large,</b> <b>the</b> next generation of female cubs may be forced to leave to eke out their own territory. Furthermore, when a new male lion takes over the pride, adolescent lions, both male and female, may be evicted.|$|E

The 20 million subsidy is a transfer from the government to the firm hence it has no effect on national welfare (ignoring costs of taxation; as long as these are not too <b>large</b> <b>the</b> basic insight of the model goes through). Additionally the domestic firm gains 50 million which would have otherwise gone to the foreign firm.|$|E
5|$|In August, Admiral Sir Thomas Graves led a fleet from New York {{to attack}} de Grasse's fleet.

The 6–9 red-speckled white eggs are laid on a deep base of pine or other wood chips.|$|E
5|$|Aarhus also hosts {{recurring}} events {{dedicated to}} specific art genres. International Living theatre (ILT) is a bi-annual festival established in 2009, but with performing arts and stage art {{on a broad}} scale.

5|$|An adult {{dragonfly}} {{has three}} distinct segments, the head, thorax, and abdomen {{as in all}} insects. It has a chitinous exoskeleton of hard plates held together with flexible membranes. The head is large with very short antennae. It {{is dominated by the}} two compound eyes, which cover most of its surface. The compound eyes are made up of ommatidia, the numbers being greater in the larger species. Aeshna interrupta has 22650 ommatidia of two varying sizes, 4500 being <b>large.</b> <b>The</b> facets facing downward tend to be smaller. Petalura gigantea has 23890 ommatidia of just one size. These facets provide complete vision in the frontal hemisphere of the dragonfly. The compound eyes meet {{at the top of the}} head (except in the Petaluridae and Gomphidae, as also in the genus Epiophlebia). Also, they have three simple eyes or ocelli. The mouthparts are adapted for biting with a toothed jaw; the flap-like labrum, at the front of the mouth, can be shot rapidly forward to catch prey. The head has a system for locking it in place that consists of muscles and small hairs on the back of the head that grip structures on the front of the first thoracic segment. This arrester system is unique to the Odonata, and is activated when feeding and during tandem flight.|$|E
5|$|As {{professional}} football {{became a national}} television phenomenon, college football did as well. In the 1950s, Notre Dame, which had a large national following, formed its own network to broadcast its games, but by and <b>large</b> <b>the</b> sport still retained a mostly regional following. In 1952, the NCAA claimed all television broadcasting rights for the games of its member institutions, and it alone negotiated television rights. This situation continued until 1984, when several schools brought a suit under the Sherman Antitrust Act; the Supreme Court ruled against the NCAA and schools are now free to negotiate their own television deals. ABC Sports began broadcasting a national Game of the Week in 1966, bringing key matchups and rivalries to a national audience for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Bellaire {{currently}} has a city manager style of government. The home rule government was established on April 2, 1949, replacing the general law form of government. The city council {{is made up}} of the mayor and six city council members.

The mayor may not serve for more than four terms in that position. A council members may have no more than two terms as a city council member. Bellaire has zoning ordinances that dictate types of structures and uses throughout sections of the city. As of 2015, the mayor is Dr. Phil Nauert. The six council members are, in order of position, Roman F. Reed (1), Jim Avioli, Sr. (2), Gus Pappas (3), Pat McLaughlan (4), Andrew S. Friedberg (5), and Mandy Nathan (6).|$|E

5|$|By October 1460, Ferdinand {{was able}} to {{recapture}} his western territories from Capua to Beneventum. In his eastern frontier, however, his enemies remained at <b>large.</b> <b>The</b> most dangerous among them was Piccinino. Piccinino had undertaken the task of blocking papal and Neapolitan troops en route to Apulia. Since Roberto Orsini, the man left {{in charge of the}} east and Giovanni Orsini's brother who had remained loyal to Ferdinand, was deemed incompetent, Ferdinand invited Constantine to Naples, offering him a leading role in an operation against Piccinino. Along with Constantine's cavalry, Francesco del Balzo, the Duke of Andria who had remained loyal to Ferdinand, managed to defeat Ercole d'Este in Gargano. They then had control over the custom-duties gathered there which brought 30,000 ducats annually from which most of Piccinino's pay came. The fighting continued for three months after which Constantine and Ferdinand were able to regain some lost territory. Piccinino prepared his own counteroffensive, along with Giovanni Orsini's men, laying siege to the main castles. A fierce battle soon erupted over Venosa on 28 May 1461 where the Albanian cavalry took part. Ferdinand abandoned the city and fled back to Apulia. Near Troia, he met Skanderbeg's ambassador, Gjokë Stres Balsha, who informed him that Skanderbeg was ready to land in Italy as soon as the proper galleys were provided.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{balked at}} the plan, seeing in it {{an end to the}} United States policy of {{isolationism}} and the beginning of imperialism. Even some supporters of naval expansion were wary; Senator Eugene Hale feared that because the proposal was so <b>large,</b> <b>the</b> entire bill would be shot down and no money appropriated for any ships. However, in April 1890, the United States House of Representatives approved funding for three 8,000-long ton battleships. Tracy, trying to soothe tensions within Congress, remarked that these ships were so powerful that only twelve would be necessary instead of the 35 called for in the original plan. He also slashed the operating costs of the Navy by giving the remaining Civil War-era monitors—which were utterly obsolete by this time—to navy militias operated by the states. The appropriation was also approved by the Senate, and in total three coast-defense battleships (the Indiana class), a cruiser, and a torpedo boat were given official approval and funding on 30 June 1890.|$|E
5|$|Custer’s 7th Cavalry {{advance party}} {{attacked}} Cheyenne and Lakota tribes at their {{camp on the}} Little Big Horn River (known as the Greasy Grass River to the Lakota) on June 25, 1876. The U.S. Army did not realize how <b>large</b> <b>the</b> camp was. More than 2,000 Native American warriors had left their reservations to follow Sitting Bull. Inspired by a vision of Sitting Bull’s, in which he saw U.S. soldiers being killed {{as they entered the}} tribe’s camp, the Cheyenne and Lakota fought back. Custer's badly outnumbered troops lost ground quickly and were forced to retreat. The tribes led a counter-attack against the soldiers on a nearby ridge, ultimately annihilating them.|$|E

40|$|Homeopathy {{contends that}} higher dilutions {{of the active}} {{ingredient}} in a remedy (fewer molecules in each dose) produce stronger medical effects [1]. This idea is inconsistent with observed dose-response relationships of conventional drugs, where the effects increase with the concentration of the active ingredient in the body [2]. The conventional dose-response relationship {{has been found in}} numerous scientific studies on organisms as diverse as nematodes [3], rats [4], and humans [5]. Further it is consistent with the behavior of simple physical and chemical systems,-e. g. <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>the</b> force on a spring, <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>the</b> displacement (Hooke’s law), or <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>the</b> voltage on a resistor, <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>the</b> current (Ohm’s law), and <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>the</b> concentration difference within a solution, <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>the</b> particle flux (Fick’s law), <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>the</b> temperature difference on a solid <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>the</b> heat flow, and so on. The dose-response relationship describes the changes in an organism caused by different levels of exposure (or doses) of a stressor (typically a chemical, heat, radiation, or a force). The dose-response relationship quantifies the response of an individual (e. g. small dose has no observable effect, large dose is fatal) or the response of a population (e. g. how many patients a cured at different levels of exposure).
