The most obvious of these was its reverse-coloured keys (black naturals and white sharps) similar to a harpsichord. Then the chrome Z-shaped bolt-on <b>leg</b> <b>stand</b> assembly and bright vermilion (in some models grey) top made for a very distinctive and handsome piece of equipment. The Vox Continental used six slider-type, metered volume controls called drawbars instead of the stop-tab rocker switches seen on other combo organs. Two of the drawbars controlled the voices (flute and reed tones), {{and three of the}} other four controlled the footages (in reference to ranks of pipes on a pipe organ, but were essentially successive octave controls; the lower the footage number, the higher the octaves were pitched (8 foot being one octave higher than 16 foot etc.), the last of the four controlling a mixture of four higher pitches. There was a single-speed, single intensity vibrato, but the Continental had no other special effects or bass notes. Its simplicity was appreciated by many players.|$|E
5000|$|The {{evidence}} {{must have}} been the product of interrogation. A defendant who seeks to challenge the admissibility of a statement under Miranda must show that the statement was [...] "prompted by police conduct that constituted 'interrogation'". A volunteered statement by a person in custody does not implicate Miranda. In Rhode Island v. Innis, the Supreme Court defined interrogation as express questioning and [...] "any words or actions {{on the part of the}} police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect". Thus, a practice that the police [...] "should know is reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response from a suspect ... amounts to interrogation". For example, confronting the suspect with incriminating evidence may be sufficiently evocative to amount to interrogation because the police are implicitly communicating a question: [...] "How do you explain this?" [...] On the other hand, [...] "unforeseeable results of police words or actions" [...] do not constitute interrogation. Under this definition, routine statements made during the administration of sobriety tests would not implicate Miranda. For example, a police officer arrests a male person for impaired driving and takes him to the police station to administer an intoxilyzer test. While at the station the officer also asks the defendant to perform certain psycho-physical tests such as the walk and turn, one <b>leg</b> <b>stand</b> or finger to nose test. It is standard practice to instruct the arrestee on how to perform the test and to demonstrate the test. (Note that the police will not tell the person that they have the right to refuse to perform the test, and the refusal cannot be used in evidence against them, nor can they be in any way punished for refusing to perform it, same as the police will not tell someone that they may refuse to perform a roadside sobriety test without penalty). An incriminating statement made by an arrestee during the instruction, [...] "I couldn't do that even if I was sober", would not be the product of interrogation. Similarly, incriminating statements made in response to requests for consent to search a vehicle or other property are not considered to be the product of interrogation.|$|E

40|$|Background. Aging is {{associated}} with increases in fat mass (FM) and decreases in fat-free mass (FFM) that may affect physical capacity. However, {{it is not clear}} whether high FM or low FFM contribute more to a reduction in physical capacity. Methods. A structural equation modeling strategy was used to test an explanatory model of the association between body composition and physical capacity. The concept of physical capacity was assessed by walking speed at a normal pace and the one <b>leg</b> <b>stand</b> test. To test the model, 904 men and women between 67 and 84 years old were studied. Body composition was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Confounding factors related to body composition and physical capacities were included in the explanatory model (physical activity level, age, gender, and number of reported diseases). Results. The final model showed that physical capacity can be represented by a factorial first-order model including generic measures of walking speed and balance. Moreover, our results showed that percentage of FM was significantly associated with physical capacity (p,. 01), whereas no such association was observed with FFM. Other variables such as physical activity level, number of self-reported diseases, and age were associated with physical capacity (all p,. 01). Overall, the proposed model explained 48 % and 57 % of the variance observed in men and women when using the one <b>leg</b> <b>stand</b> and the walking speed at normal pace tests as measures of physical capacity. Conclusion. FM was significantly and inversely correlated with physical capacity, whereas FFM was not associated when controlled for other potential confounding variables.

40|$|Single leg loading {{tests are}} used {{clinically}} to examine balance and loading strategies in individuals with lower limb pain. Interpretation {{of these tests}} is through pain responses and comparisons with the asymptomatic leg. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine normal differences in trunk and pelvic movement between legs during the single <b>leg</b> <b>stand,</b> single leg squat, hip hitch and hip drop tests, and to compare observational and quantitative assessments of trunk movement during the single leg squat test. Thirty-one asymptomatic females (age = 21. 7 ± 3. 1 years) performed each test in a random sequence and quantitative analysis of coronal plane trunk lean (magnitude and direction), and femoro-pelvic angle was conducted using photographic image analysis. Within- and between-side minimal significant differences (MD) for femoro-pelvic angle were defined for each test. All tests had excellent within-side reliability (intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) = 0. 87 - 0. 97, standard error of measurement (SEM) = 0. 6 - 1. 2 °). The between-side MD for femoro-pelvic angle was 6. 3, 6. 5, 9. 7, and 6. 7 ° for the single <b>leg</b> <b>stand,</b> single leg squat, hip hitch and hip drop tests respectively. The magnitude of trunk lean was small, increased with test complexity and was not consistent in relation to the stance leg. Excellent agreement (87 - 93 %) for the direction of trunk movement between observers, and between observational and quantitative analysis (80 - 96 %) was established for the single leg squat test. The patterns of trunk motion, and thresholds for significant difference in femoro-pelvic angle established in this study, will assist the interpretation of single leg loading tests in individuals with lower limb pain disorders...|$|E

Patients and methods: Twenty fragility fracture patients and 21 healthy control subjects were evaluated using clinical assessment tools (Nintendo Wii Balance Board [WBB], a handheld dynamometer, and an application for the Apple iPod Touch, the Level Belt) that measure functional performance during activity of daily living tasks. The main outcome measurements were balance (WBB), handgrip strength (handheld dynamometer), and lumbopelvic control (iPod Touch Level Belt), which were compared between fragility fracture patients and healthy controls. Results: Fragility fracture patients had lower scores on the vertical component of the WBB Torso Twist task (P= 0. 042) and greater medial–lateral lumbopelvic sway during a 40 m walk (P= 0. 026) when compared to healthy controls. Unexpectedly, the fracture patients had significantly higher scores on the left leg (P= 0. 020) and total components (P= 0. 010) of the WBB Single <b>Leg</b> <b>Stand</b> task as well as less faults during the left Single <b>Leg</b> <b>Stand</b> task (P= 0. 003).

The {{purpose of the study was}} to measure individual performances in different motor abilities in elderly women and compare their average value of achieved performance with existing norms from different age category point of view. From the Senior Fitness Test battery (Rikli, & Jones, 2001) that consists of six performance-based tasks validate to measure functional fitness components we picked up 3 of them (back scratch test, 8 -foot up-and-go test and chair stand test). For further measurements we chose 3 additional tests like modified sit and reach test, test of lateral spine flexion and one <b>leg</b> <b>stand</b> test. 129 elderly women in age from 60 to 89 years participated in our research. We divided respondents into five age categories where we provided comparison of average value of achieved motor performance in selected tests with existing norms. Women of all examined age categories (60 - 64, 65 - 69, 70 - 74, 75 - 79 and 80 - 89 years) achieved average level of motor abilities in all measured test except in chair stand test, where three age categories of Slovak elderly women (60 - 64, 65 - 69 and 70 - 74 years) showed even above-average level of lower limbs strength. In all tested motor abilities active elderly women presented higher level of motor performance comparing sedentary elderly women. On the basis of our results we can confirm, that Slovak elderly women have an appropriate level of their motor performance, where better results were found in-group of active elderly women.

40|$|Introduction: The {{number of}} cancer {{survivors}} is increasing {{and the need}} for multidisciplinary cancer rehabilitation centers is on the rise. The Cancer Rehabilitation and Cachexia Clinic at the McGill University Health Centre, aims to provide personalized, multidisciplinary care by introducing the concept of three patient streams based on symptom progression: restorative, supportive and cachexia. Patients at this clinic are seen by five cancer care specialists whose goal is to improve quality of life while restoring or maintaining their functional abilities. The present study evaluated the functional outcomes of the patients who participated in the multidisciplinary cancer rehabilitation clinic in 2014. Objectives: To evaluate the functional improvement in the hand grip strength, six minute walk test, sit to stand test and the single <b>leg</b> <b>stand</b> test, of patients {{who took part in the}} interdisciplinary cancer rehabilitation clinic. Methods: 115 patients with cancer were referred to the Cancer Rehabilitation and Cachexia Clinic from January to December 2014. Physical functional was assessed at baseline visits, follow-up visits and at the end evaluation, by performing the had-grip strength test, 6 minute walk-test, sit-to-stand test, and single <b>leg</b> <b>stand</b> test. The data was analysed for each dependent variable to determine if any baseline differences existed among the three program streams (restorative stream, supportive stream, cachexia stream) and to measure if the patients improved their functional status pre-post rehabilitation after completing the respective assigned streams. Results: There were 48 patients assigned in the cachexia stream, 28 patients in the restorative and 39 in the supportive stream. The most predominant type of cancer was lung cancer. At baseline, the cachexia stream had significantly lower weight, BMI and higher WBC compared to the restorative stream. At baseline, patients in the supportive stream had a significant higher percentile HGS when compared to the cachexia stream (p< 0. 05). Although not statistically significant, all three streams slightly improved their hand-grip strength while being part of the program. Conclusion: Overall function of the groups did not show improvement based upon the 6 MWT and HGS. However, the supportive stream did show improvement in their percentile HGS. Thus, the interdisciplinary rehabilitation services demonstrated only mild improvements in the supportive but no measureable differences in the restorative or cachexic patient groups...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} whether rock climbing type exercise {{would be of}} value in rehabilitating ankle injuries to improve ankle stability and coordination. Methods: A group of 25 rock climbers was compared {{with a group of}} 26 soccer players. All were male, uninjured, and exercised three to four times a week. Active ankle stability was evaluated by one <b>leg</b> <b>stand</b> stabilometry (measurement of migration of the centre of gravity) and measurements of maximum strength of ankle isokinetic concentric flexion and extension (Cybex). Results: The rock climbers showed significantly better results in the stabilometry and greater absolute and relative maximum strength of flexion in the ankle. The soccer players showed greater absolute but not relative strength in extension. Conclusion: Rock climbing, because of its slow and controlled near static movements, may be of value in the treatment of functional ankle instability. However, it has still to be confirmed whether it is superior to the usual rehabilitation exercises such as use of the wobble board. A nkle sprain {{is one of the most}} common sports injuries.

Ten individuals, mean age of 51. 4 (± 6. 7 years), participated of eight 60 -minute sessions comprising kinesiotherapy (15 min), Nintendo Wii (30 min) and Learning transfer (15 min) exercises. After training, nonparametric statistical analysis showed significant improvement in total FIM (p=. 01) and BERG scores (p=. 00), and in some of their subitems: FIM - dressing lower body (p=. 01), transfer to bathtub/shower (p=. 02) and locomotion: stairs (p=. 03); BERG - reaching forward with outstretched arm (p=. 01), retrieving object from the floor (p=. 04), turning 360 º (p=. 01), placing alternate foot on step (p&# 8804;. 01), standing with one foot in front (p=. 01), and one <b>leg</b> <b>stand</b> (p=. 03). These findings suggest a positive influence of virtual reality exercises adjunct to conventional therapy on rehabilitation of balance and functionality post stroke, and indicate the feasibility of the proposed VR-based rehabilitation program...|$|E
