5|$|Close to the Peary, the Aurora {{receives}} an indistinct distress call from another ship and alters its course to help, but inquiries by Tintin expose that the distress signal is a decoy to delay them. Resuming the journey, they intercept a cable announcing that the Peary expedition {{has reached the}} meteorite but not yet claimed it. While the Peary crew rows to the meteorite, Tintin uses the Auroras seaplane to parachute onto the meteorite and plant the expedition's flag. Tintin makes camp while the Auroras engines are repaired after developing trouble. The next day he discovers that Phostlite accelerates growth, and makes things much larger: his apple core grows into a large tree while a maggot grows into a huge butterfly, and Tintin is menaced by a giant spider that escaped from his <b>lunch</b> <b>box,</b> and immense, explosive mushrooms before rescue arrives. A sudden seaquake shakes the meteorite to its core and it sinks into the sea, just as Tintin and Snowy escape to the Aurora {{with a piece of}} Phostlite. Thereafter Bohlwinkel learns that he is expected to be tried for his crimes. As the Aurora returns home, Captain Haddock steers the ship toward land to refuel not with oil, but with whiskey.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth of}} {{political}} consciousness started after {{the establishment of}} the Bombay Presidency Association on 31 January 1885. The Bombay Millowners' Association was formed in February 1875 by Dinshaw Maneckji Petit in order to lourdes central school protect interests of workers threatened by possible factory and tariff legislation by the British. The first session of the Indian National Congress was held in Bombay from 28–31 December 1885. The Bombay Municipal Act was enacted in 1888 which gave the British Government wide powers of interference in civic matters. The Victoria Terminus of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway, one of the finest stations in the world, was completed in May 1888. The concept of Dabbawalas (<b>lunch</b> <b>box</b> delivery man) originated in the 1890s when British people who came to Bombay did not like the local food. So the Dabbawala service was set up to bring lunch to these people in their workplace straight from their home. On 11 August 1893, a serious communal riot took place between the Hindus and Muslims, when a Shiva temple was attacked by Muslims in Bombay. 75 people were killed and 350 were injured. In September 1896, Bombay was hit by a bubonic plague epidemic where the death toll was estimated at 1,900 people per week. Around 850,000, amounting to half of the population, fled Bombay during this time. On 9 March 1898, there was a serious riot which started with a sudden outbreak of hostility against the measures adopted by Government for suppression of plague. The riot led to a strike of dock and railway workers which paralysed the city for a few days. The significant results of the plague was the creation of the Bombay City Improvement Trust on 9 December 1898 and the Haffkine Institute on 10 January 1899 by Waldemar Haffkine. The Dadar-Matunga-Wadala-Sion scheme, the first planned suburban scheme in Bombay, was formulated in 1899–1900 by the Bombay City Improvement Trust to relieve congestion in the centre of the town, following the plague epidemics. The cotton mill industry was adversely affected during 1900 and 1901 due to the flight of workers because of the plague.|$|E

Bautista married his second wife Angie on October 13, 1998; however, they {{divorced}} in 2006. Before the age of 40, Bautista had already become a grandfather of two grandsons: Jacob and Aiden by Keilani, his first daughter. During his marriage with Angie, Bautista became an avid collector of vintage metal lunch boxes. He admits his favorite is the 1967 Green Hornet <b>lunch</b> <b>box,</b> as it has Bruce Lee on it. This collection started when he bought Angie an ET lunchbox and {{she did not want to}} break it, so he bought a second one. Bautista revealed that he and Angie were separated in the August 2006 edition of WWE Magazine. He later revealed, in his autobiography, a relationship with WWE Diva Melina Perez after the divorce from his wife in 2006, which led to a brief angle on SmackDown! during a feud with MNM.

5000|$|Personally I liked The <b>Lunch</b> <b>Box</b> very much. But {{eventually}} the eighteen member jury supported The Good Road.

Films are after all works of fiction, {{with the right to}} cinematic liberty! Although <b>Lunch</b> <b>Box</b> was my personal favourite, but as a chairman one should not impose his or her choice on others. And as you know this became suddenly a big controversy. And I think the media was again to some extent responsible for this decision. Because every day during the deliberation or the screenings, the media projected <b>Lunch</b> <b>Box</b> as the chosen one. It's my assumption, that the members probably thought, [...] "My God! If the media has already taken the decision then why we are here?" [...] It was a Chomskian 'manufacturing consent' - <b>Lunch</b> <b>Box,</b> <b>Lunch</b> <b>Box,</b> <b>Lunch</b> <b>Box</b> every day!! So the members, who are all very important people from the industry, had an opposite impulse. I don't know, but maybe that's the way it happened.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} improve the {{nutritional}} quality of <b>box</b> <b>lunches</b> for Mr. O in his 40 s. A sur vey {{was performed on the}} nutrient contents of homemade <b>box</b> <b>lunches,</b> which were prepared to meet his life stage, and those of <b>box</b> <b>lunches</b> purchased at convenience stores or supermarkets. His total daily energy requirement was calculated from sur vey data on his life activities. The nutrient contents of the homemade <b>box</b> <b>lunches</b> were determined in light of Dietar y Reference Intakes for Japanese (2010). Close attention was paid to the PCF and nutrient intake ratios in the preparation of the homemade <b>box</b> <b>lunches</b> for 30 days, and Mr. O was asked to express his impression of them daily. After the sur vey on the <b>box</b> <b>lunches</b> for 30 days, homemade <b>box</b> <b>lunches</b> with low salt levels were prepared for 5 days, and eight different types of <b>box</b> <b>lunches</b> were purchased at convenience stores or supermarkets. All of these <b>box</b> <b>lunches</b> were sur veyed for PCF and nutrient intake ratios, similar to the homemade <b>box</b> <b>lunches.</b> The result revealed that a good PCF ratio did not necessarily mean good nutrient balance. Auxiliar y items, which contribute to the intake of vitamins, minerals, and food fiber, were found important for <b>box</b> <b>lunch</b> preparation. Regarding salt level, even homemade <b>box</b> <b>lunches</b> tended to have high salt levels unless conscious efforts were made to flavor them for low salt levels. Furthermore, meeting reference intakes of all nutrients with <b>box</b> <b>lunches</b> alone is difficult, because increasing the level of a nutrient resulted in deficiency of other nutrients. It would be necessar y to consider nutrient intake not only from <b>box</b> <b>lunch</b> but also from all meals of a day...|$|R
