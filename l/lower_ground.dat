5|$|By the 11th century, castles {{were built}} {{throughout}} the Holy Roman Empire, which then spanned central Europe. They now typically {{took the form}} of an enclosure on a hilltop, or, on <b>lower</b> <b>ground,</b> a tall, free-standing tower (German Bergfried.) The largest castles, known in German as Hohenburgen, had well-defined inner and outer courts, but no mottes. The motte-and-bailey design began to spread into Alsace and the northern Alps from France {{during the first half of}} the 11th century, spreading further into Bohemia and Austria in the subsequent years. This form of castle was closely associated with the colonisation of newly cultivated areas within the Empire, as new lords were granted lands by the emperor and built castles close to the local gród, or town. Motte-and-bailey castle building substantially enhanced the prestige of local nobles, and it has been suggested that their early adoption was because they were a cheaper way of imitating the still more prestigious hohenburgen, but this is usually regarded as unlikely. In many cases, bergfrieds were converted into motte and bailey designs by burying existing castle towers within the mounds.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lower</b> <b>ground</b> to the {{south-east}} of Bentworth and to {{the south}} of the nearby villages of Lasham and Shalden drains towards the River Wey which rises to the surface near Alton. Near Hall Place is the village duckpond, with cottages opposite it dated to 1733. Such names as Colliers Wood and Nancole Copse in the parish point to the early operations of the charcoal burners, the colliers of the Middle Ages. Other woods in the area include Gaston Wood, Childer Hill Copse, Miller's Wood, Thedden Copse, Well Copse, North Wood, Wadgett's Copse, Bylander's Copse, Nancole Copse, Widgell Copse, South Lease Copse, Stubbins Copse and Mayhew's Wood. The names of Windmill Field and Mill Piece indicate the site of one or more ancient mills.|$|E
5|$|The {{subspecies}} P.b.borbonica is resident on Mauritius and Réunion, {{although there}} are local seasonal movements on these island, but the Madagascan subspecies is migratory. The Imerina Plateau is deserted from April to September, the martins moving to <b>lower</b> <b>ground</b> or to the African mainland. It is normally uncommon and local in coastal Mozambique, Zambia, Malawi and Pemba Island, and very rare in Kenya and mainland Tanzania, although large numbers sometimes winter in Mozambique or Malawi. It has also been recorded from Comoros and other Indian Ocean locations including at least four islands in the Seychelles. As of 2012, a total of eight birds had been sighted in the Seychelles, occurring in both the spring and autumn migration periods. Some of these records {{may be due to}} vagrant birds carried by cyclones. There are unsubstantiated claims of occurrences in the Transvaal.|$|E

5|$|There was a {{large degree}} of {{variation}} in the size and exact shape of the castles built in England and Wales after the invasion. One popular form of castle was the motte and bailey, in which earth would be piled up into a mound (called a motte) to support a wooden tower, and a wider enclosed area built alongside it (called a bailey); Stafford Castle is a typical example of a post-invasion motte castle. Another widespread design was the ringwork in which earth would be built up in a circular or oval shape and topped with a wooden rampart; Folkestone Castle {{is a good example}} of a Norman ringwork, in this case built on top of a hill although most post-invasion castles were usually sited on <b>lower</b> <b>ground.</b> Around 80% of Norman castles in this period followed the motte-and-bailey pattern, but ringworks were particularly popular in certain areas, such as south-west England and south Wales. One theory put forward to explain this variation is that ringworks were easier to build in these shallow-soil areas than the larger mottes.|$|E
5|$|These are {{exclusively}} Old World species. The {{rock martin}} breeds throughout Africa {{and through the}} Middle East as far as Afghanistan and Pakistan, and is replaced by the dusky crag martin further east in India and Indochina. The Eurasian crag martin breeds from Iberia and northwesternmost Africa through southern Europe, the Persian Gulf and the Himalayas to southwestern and northeastern China. Northern populations of the Eurasian crag martin are migratory, with European birds wintering in north Africa, Senegal, Ethiopia and the Nile Valley, and Asian breeders going to southern China, the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East. Some European birds stay north of the Mediterranean, and, like populations in warmer areas such as India, Turkey and Cyprus, just move to <b>lower</b> <b>ground</b> after breeding. The dusky crag martin and rock are largely resident apart from local movements after breeding, when many birds descend to lower altitudes, although some pale northern rock martins from North African and southern Arabian may winter further south alongside the local subspecies in Ethiopia, Mali and Mauritania.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{occur in}} sub-Saharan Africa. The Mascarene martin's {{breeding}} range {{is restricted to}} Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands. The nominate subspecies breeds on Mauritius and Réunion and P. b. madagascariensis occurs in Madagascar. It may also nest on Pemba {{where it has been}} seen in the breeding season. Breeding habitat can be anywhere with suitable sites for constructing a nest, such as ledges, buildings, tunnels, caves or amongst rocks. The martin is found {{on the east side of}} Réunion between , and on the south and west coasts of Mauritius. It also occurs on inland cliffs on Mauritius. P. b. borbonica is resident on Mauritius and Réunion, although there are local seasonal movements on these island, but the Madagascan subspecies is migratory, with the martins moving to <b>lower</b> <b>ground</b> or to the African mainland outside the breeding season. It is normally uncommon and local in coastal Mozambique, Zambia, Malawi and Pemba Island, and very rare in Kenya and mainland Tanzania, although large numbers sometimes winter in Mozambique or Malawi. It has also been recorded from Comoros and other Indian Ocean locations including at least four islands in the Seychelles. Some of these records may be due to vagrant birds carried by cyclones. There are unsubstantiated claims of occurrences in the Transvaal.|$|E

There are currently three eaglets in their nest. The nest is best viewed by standing at the flag pole outside the Wellburn Building at the <b>lower</b> <b>grounds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Albion {{took part}} in the Birmingham Senior Cup for the third time. In the first round, they won 7-0 against Stourbridge Standard, then {{defeated}} Walsall Alma Athletic 6-0 in the second round. Albion drew 1-1 with Wednesbury Old Athletic in round three. George Timmins scored a hat-trick in the replay, but the match finished 3-3, meaning that a second replay would be required. Albion won 3-1 at Aston <b>Lower</b> <b>Grounds.</b> After a 1-1 draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers, Albion won the fourth round replay 2-1. In the semi-final, Albion lost 0-1 to Walsall Swifts at Aston <b>Lower</b> <b>Grounds.</b>|$|R
5|$|Exmoor is an upland area formed almost {{exclusively}} from sedimentary rocks {{dating from the}} Devonian and early Carboniferous periods. The name of the geological period and system, 'Devonian', comes from Devon, as rocks of that age were first studied and described here. With {{the exception of a}} suite of Triassic and Jurassic age rocks forming the <b>lower</b> <b>ground</b> between Porlock and Timberscombe and from Minehead to Yarde (within Exmoor National Park but peripheral to the moor itself), all of the solid rocks of Exmoor are assigned to the Exmoor Group, which comprises a mix of gritstones, sandstones, slates, shales, limestone, siltstones and mudstones. Quartz and iron mineralisation can be detected in outcrops and subsoil. The Glenthorne area demonstrates the Trentishoe Member (formerly 'Formation') of the Hangman Sandstone Formation (formerly 'Group'). The Hangman Sandstone represents the Middle Devonian sequence of North Devon and Somerset. These unusual freshwater deposits in the Hangman Grits were mainly formed in desert conditions. As this area of Britain was not subject to glaciation, the plateau remains as a remarkably old landform. The bedrock and more recent superficial deposits are covered in part by moorland which is supported by wet, acid soil.|$|E
5|$|Their morale {{boosted by}} this small victory, the Greeks moved forward, still {{remaining}} on higher ground, {{to a new}} position more suited for encampment and better watered. The Spartans and Tegeans were on a ridge {{to the right of}} the line, the Athenians on a hillock on the left and the other contingents on the slightly <b>lower</b> <b>ground</b> between. In response, Mardonius brought his men up to the Asopus and arrayed them for battle; However, neither the Persians nor the Greeks would attack; Herodotus claims this is because both sides received bad omens during sacrificial rituals. The armies thus stayed camped in their locations for eight days, during which new Greek troops arrived. Mardonius then sought to break the stalemate by sending his cavalry to attack the passes of Mount Cithaeron; this raid resulted in the capture of a convoy of provisions intended for the Greeks. Two more days passed, during which time the supply lines of the Greeks continued to be menaced. Mardonius then launched another cavalry raid on the Greek lines, which succeeded in blocking the Gargaphian Spring, which had been the only source of water for the Greek army (they could not use the Asopus due to the threat posed by Persian archers). Coupled with the lack of food, the restriction of the water supply made the Greek position untenable, so they decided to retreat to a position in front of Plataea, from where they could guard the passes and have access to fresh water. To prevent the Persian cavalry from attacking during the retreat, it was to be performed that night.|$|E

5|$|Due to a {{congested}} fixture list, Albion fielded {{a reserve}} {{side in the}} first two rounds of their fifth Birmingham Senior Cup campaign, beating Sparkhill Alliance 6–0 and Burton Swifts 4–1. Tommy Green scored a hat-trick in the third round match away at Notts Rangers, as Albion ran out 7–2 winners. Burslem Port Vale were defeated 5–0 in the semi-final, which took place at a neutral venue, Aston <b>Lower</b> <b>Grounds.</b> The team drew 1–1 with Walsall Swifts in the final, which was also at Aston <b>Lower</b> <b>Grounds.</b> The replay took place at the same venue and George Woodhall scored the only goal of the game as Albion won the trophy for the first time.|$|R

500|$|The Aston <b>Lower</b> <b>Grounds,</b> later renamed Villa Park, was not {{the first}} home of Aston Villa F.C. Their {{previous}} venue, Wellington Road, faced increasing problems including an uneven pitch, poor spectator facilities, a lack of access and exorbitant rents. As a result, in 1894 Villa's committee began negotiations with the owners of the Aston <b>Lower</b> <b>Grounds,</b> [...] "the finest sports ground in the district." [...] Situated in the former grounds of Aston Hall, a Jacobean stately home, the <b>Lower</b> <b>Grounds</b> had seen varied uses over the years. Originally the kitchen garden of Aston Hall's owner Sir Thomas Holte, after whom the Holte End stand was named, it later became a Victorian amusement park with an aquarium and a great hall. The current pitch stands {{on the site of the}} Dovehouse Pool, an ornamental pond that was drained in 1889. In place of the pool, the owners of the <b>Lower</b> <b>Grounds</b> built a cycle track and sports ground that opened on 10 June 1889 for a combined cycling and athletics event before a crowd of 15,000. Negotiations continued for two years before the Villa committee reached agreement with the site's owner, Edgar Flower, to rent the <b>Lower</b> <b>Grounds</b> for £300 per annum on a 21-year lease with an option to buy the site at any point during the term. The committee immediately engaged an architect who began preparing plans for the site, which included construction of a new [...] cement cycle track to replace the existing cinder one. The main stand was to be built to the east on the Witton Lane side, with the track and pitch fully enclosed by banking. Construction of the final phase of the stadium began in late 1896 after negotiations with contractors over the price. Several months behind schedule, the almost-complete stadium opened with a friendly against Blackburn Rovers on 17 April 1897, one week after Aston Villa had completed the League and FA Cup 'Double'. The process of fixing issues with the building work continued for several months. As built, the stadium could house 40,000 spectators, most of whom stood in the open on the banking.|$|R

25|$|In 1991 the Myer Centre {{was opened}} in Adelaide housing the largest Myer store in South Australia {{featuring}} over 80 smaller shops. It has an eight level atrium inside the shopping centre and six levels inside the Myer {{store and a}} food court underneath in the <b>lower</b> <b>ground</b> level. For the first seven years until 1998, the top two levels of the atrium housed an indoor amusement park known as Dazzeland featuring Australia's only indoor rollercoaster.|$|E
25|$|Without the {{advantage}} of good observation the protracted artillery fire-fight which developed was lost by the British gunners who had problems getting ammunition forward over the fire-swept <b>lower</b> <b>ground</b> and at critical moments the infantry lacked much needed fire support owing to great difficulties in communicating with the artillery. It was eventually decided to stop the attack and to resume it the next morning. After sunset the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade withdrew into reserve by the Ghoraniyeh bridge leaving the Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment with the 180th Brigade.|$|E
