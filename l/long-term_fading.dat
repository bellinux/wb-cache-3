40|$|According to many publications, alkali feldspars are {{characterized}} by specific athermal (anomalous) fading of their thermoluminescence and optically-stimulated luminescence. This phenomenon is manifested as spontaneous decline in luminescence intensity over relatively long (months and years) time after laboratory irradiation, possibly due to tunnelling of electrons from lattice defects and impurities acting as dosimetric traps. It can hamper reliable luminescent dating of Quaternary deposits {{on the basis of}} feldspar extractions due to possible unpredictable underestimation of the ages. In this paper we present some experimental results related to the manifestation of the phenomenon.

Each receiver is interested in one unique message that can be available at two transmitters. The considered rate criterion is the average per user degrees of freedom (puDoF) as K goes to infinity. Prior to this work, the optimal assignment of messages to transmitters were identified in the two limits as p goes to 0 and as p goes to 1. We identify new schemes that achieve average puDoF values that are higher than {{the state of the}} art for a significant part of the range 0 < p < 1. The key idea to our results is to understand that the role of cooperation shifts from increasing the probability of delivering a message to its intended destination at high values of p, to interference cancellation at low values of p. Our schemes are based on an algorithm that achieves the optimal DoF value in any network realization, when restricted to a given message assignment as well as the use of zero-forcing schemes.

30|$|The {{main goal}} of the present paper has been to {{describe}} the DBM applied to Japanese seismicity. This study has been mainly motivated by the participation to the CSEP experiment for the Japanese testing region. From a seismolog-ical point of view, the results obtained {{in the present study}} basically confirm the main finding of previous analyses (Marzocchi and Lombardi, 2008; Lombardi and Marzocchi, 2009, 2010). Large earthquakes in Japan tend to cluster in time and space at different time scales. Besides the short-term clustering described by the ETAS model, we have found also a significant time clustering longer than typical aftershock sequences. Notably, we have found that the DBM has a different forecasting performance on shallow and deep seismicity. Specifically the DBM has a poor reliability on seismicity with a depth up to 100 km, whereas it works significantly better than ETAS model for shallow seismic events (up to 30 km of depth). The scarce fitting with DBM and ETAS model is probably due to the use of epicentral distances; neglecting depth may alter significantly the real distance between earthquakes. Another possibility is that offshore and deeper earthquakes have different features compared to crustal inland earthquakes. The characteristic time of the second branching for the crustal earthquakes (t ~ 8 years) seems to be smaller than the characteristic time found in other regions (Marzocchi and Lombardi, 2008; Lombardi and Marzocchi, 2009, 2010). We explain this shorter time length as due to the high seismic background for Japanese seismicity. In fact, the time decay of the <b>long-term</b> interaction will <b>fade</b> sooner into the background seismicity when the latter is higher. In any case the value of t is in agreement with Lombardi and Marzocchi (2007), which founded a significant variation of background seismicity in Japan about every 10 years.|$|R

[...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2014 Cellular 3 G/ 4 G networks provide a wonderfully {{rich set of}} applications and social networking capabilities. From a QoS perspective, the traffic is basically divided into Real time and Non real time traffic which helps in scheduling priorities to the packets. With increase in need for QoS in the commercial networks, scheduling schemes such as MLWDF (Modified Largest Weighted Delay First) are playing {{a prominent role in}} deciding factors of packet selection. But most of these features are not available to public safety and emergency organizations where these organizations must use dedicated systems to obtain the reliability and protected performance that is needed. This research work provides a brief survey of the regulatory and commercial issues involved. The research work then provides solutions to give real-time and non-real-time traffic scheduling priorities to balance different requirements. We introduce the concept of a queue indicator that uses queue awareness to decide which traffic type to transmit. Then we introduce the concept of group scheduling that adds together scheduling metrics of different users within groups to decide which groups should transmit. These metrics are both opportunistic to take advantage of changing channel conditions and they are queue aware to adapt to traffic conditions. But the metrics are very simple so that scheduling mechanisms are practical and scalable for implementations. These are all evaluated through a detailed simulator (MATLAB-Simulator) that models <b>long-term</b> and short-term <b>fading</b> impacts. We find the best queue indicator values and then assess different cases where groups have various delay requirements. With the ever increasing number of users and the usage of data in cellular networks, meeting the expectations is a very difficult challenge. To add to the difficulties, the available resources are very limited, so proper management of these resources is very much needed.
