5000|$|In some {{gas supply}} {{connections}} to prevent dangerous misconnections. For example in gas welding the flammable gas supply line is attached with <b>left-handed</b> <b>threads,</b> {{so it will}} not be accidentally switched with the oxygen supply, which uses right-handed threads.|$|R
50|$|Henry Hindley {{designed}} and constructed a screw-cutting lathe circa 1739. It featured a plate guiding the tool and power supplied by a hand-cranked series of gears. By changing the gears, he could cut screws with different pitch. Removing a gear permitted {{him to make}} <b>left-handed</b> <b>threads.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In some {{devices that}} have threads on either end, like {{turnbuckles}} and removable pipe segments. These parts have one right-handed and one <b>left-handed</b> <b>thread,</b> so that turning the piece tightens or loosens both threads {{at the same}} time.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{situation}} where neither threaded pipe end can be rotated to tighten or loosen the joint (e.g. in traditional heating pipes running through multiple rooms in a building). In such a case, the coupling will have one right-handed and one <b>left-handed</b> <b>thread.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{instrument}} has an atypical <b>left-handed</b> screw <b>threading</b> (like {{the screw}} {{in the left}} pedal of a bicycle) so that the application of sealer or cement will flow down {{the tip of the}} spiral when the slow-speed is in forward mode.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes the {{opposite}} (left-handed, counterclockwise, reverse) sense of threading {{is used for}} a special reason. A thread might need to be left-handed to prevent operational stresses from loosening it. For example, some older cars and trucks had right-handed lug nuts on the right wheels and left-handed ones on the left wheels, so that, as the vehicle moved forward, the lug nuts tended to tighten rather than loosen. For bicycle pedals, {{the one on the}} left must be reverse-threaded to prevent it unscrewing during use. Similarly, the flyer whorl of a spinning wheel uses a left-hand thread to keep it from loosening. A turnbuckle has right-handed threads on one end and <b>left-handed</b> <b>threads</b> on the other. Some gas fittings are left-handed to prevent disastrous misconnections: oxygen fittings are right-handed, but acetylene, propane, and other flammable gases are unmistakably distinguished by left-handed fittings.|$|R
50|$|A {{coupling}} nut, {{also known}} as extension nut, is a threaded fastener for joining two male threads, most commonly a threaded rod, but also pipes. The outside of the fastener is usually a hex so a wrench can hold it. Variations include reducing coupling nuts, for joining two different size threads; sight hole coupling nuts, which have a sight hole for observing the amount of engagement; and coupling nuts with <b>left-handed</b> <b>threads.</b> These are used to make up long rod assemblies from shorter lengths of rods. The rods are threaded into the coupling nut for a certain distance. Coupling nut dimensions are described by the Industrial Fasteners Institute in standard IFI-128. It is given a plain finish. It is either cold drawn or hot rolled depending on the bar stock used. Coupling nuts threaded with two different thread sizes and profiles are called reducing coupling nuts.|$|R

Objects brought together into coarse alignment, shaft turned, causing upper object, mounting bracket, and fixed nut to travel downward on <b>left-handed</b> <b>thread</b> and traveling nut upward on right-handed thread. This allows J-hook to turn under spring load and reach under receptacle...|$|E
5000|$|By common convention, right-{{handedness}} is {{the default}} handedness for screw threads. [...] Therefore, most threaded parts and fasteners have right-handed threads. One {{explanation for why}} right-handed threads became standard is that for a right-handed person, tightening a right-handed screw with a screwdriver is easier than tightening a left-handed screw, because it uses the stronger supinator muscle of the arm rather than the weaker pronator muscle. [...] Since most people are right-handed, right-handed threads became standard on <b>threaded</b> fasteners. <b>Left-handed</b> screw <b>threads</b> are used in some machines and in these applications: ...|$|R
40|$|Linear back-drive {{differentials}} {{have been}} proposed as alternatives to conventional gear differentials for applications {{in which there is}} only limited rotational motion (e. g., oscillation). The finite nature of the rotation makes it possible to optimize a linear back-drive differential in ways that would not be possible for gear differentials or other differentials that are required to be capable of unlimited rotation. As a result, relative to gear differentials, linear back-drive differentials could be more compact and less massive, could contain fewer complex parts, and could be less sensitive to variations in the viscosities of lubricants. Linear back-drive differentials would operate according to established principles of power ball screws and linear-motion drives, but would utilize these principles in an innovative way. One major characteristic of such mechanisms that would be exploited in linear back-drive differentials is the possibility of designing them to drive or back-drive with similar efficiency and energy input: in other words, such a mechanism can be designed so that a rotating screw can drive a nut linearly or the linear motion of the nut can cause the screw to rotate. A linear back-drive differential (see figure) would include two collinear shafts connected to two parts that are intended to engage in limited opposing rotations. The linear back-drive differential would also include a nut that would be free to translate along its axis but not to rotate. The inner surface of the nut would be right-hand threaded at one end and left-hand threaded at the opposite end to engage corresponding right- and <b>left-handed</b> <b>threads</b> on the shafts. A rotation and torque introduced into the system via one shaft would drive the nut in linear motion. The nut, in turn, would back-drive the other shaft, creating a reaction torque. Balls would reduce friction, making it possible for the shaft/nut coupling on each side to operate with 90 percent efficiency...|$|R
