40|$|The studied clayey {{materials}} {{come from}} soil of Marrakech Haouz Plain. We discussed {{the influence of}} grain size, mineralogical and chemical composition of these raw materials on the lime behaviour in pottery shards. In this {{paper we propose some}} recommendations to inhibit <b>lime</b> <b>blowing</b> and the efflorescences responsible for flaws. The application of such recommendations will improve the quality of produced pottery and the income of potters in the region. Peer reviewe...|$|E
60|$|<b>Lime's</b> <b>blow</b> had dazed Steve for a moment, but at {{the same}} time it had sobered him. He came to his feet with a rising mutter that sounded like the {{swelling}} snarl of a tiger. He had been taken by surprise before, and he now came forward with his hands in position, to vindicate his terrible reputation. The two men met in a frightful struggle. Blows that meant murder were dealt by each. Each slapping thud seemed to carry the cracking of bones in it. Steve was the more agile of the two and circled rapidly around, striking like a boxer.|$|R

50|$|Weldon was a {{successful}} chemist and developed the Weldon process to produce chlorine by boiling hydrochloric acid with manganese dioxide. MnO2 was expensive, and Weldon developed a process for its recycling by treating the manganese chloride produced with milk of <b>lime</b> and <b>blowing</b> air through the mixture to form a precipitate known as Weldon mud which was used to generate more chlorine.|$|R
2500|$|Aided {{by their}} upwind position, the English archers inflicted {{considerable}} {{damage on the}} enemy sailors and soldiers before the French bowmen were able to effectively reply. The English also opened pots of <b>lime</b> which <b>blew</b> {{in the faces of}} the French. Early in the battle, the French flagship engaged Richard FitzRoy's ship. As more English ships came up, they joined the fight against the flagship, while the other French ships maintained their tight formation, but failed to assist their flagship.|$|R
50|$|The {{blistering}} {{of painted}} surfaces {{may be caused}} in several ways. If on iron, {{it may be the}} result of a particle of rust which, not having been removed in the process of cleaning, has increased in size and loosened the paint. If on plaster, a particle of unslaked <b>lime</b> may have <b>blown,</b> with a similar result. On wood, blistering is usually caused by painting upon a wet surface or upon unseasoned wood. Blisters may also be caused by the use of too much oil in paint exposed to heat, or the application of one coat upon another before the latter is properly dry. To prevent blistering a method that has been tried with good results is to apply two coats of water paint (washable distemper) and follow by two coats of oil color or varnish. Cracking is caused by the use of too much oil in the under coats and too little in the topcoats.|$|R
40|$|At SSAB EMEA in Luleå {{steel is}} {{manufactured}} mainly based on pellets from LKAB, Malmberget {{but a small}} part is from Kiruna. But in the future, {{the majority of the}} pellets will come from Kiruna instead of Malmberget. What distinguishes these two kinds of pellets from each other is that the pellet from Kiruna has higher phosphorus content. Coal and coke used in smelting the pellets will also have a higher level of phosphorus. This will contribute that the phosphorus content in pig iron will rise which will make phosphorus removal at SSAB more difficult because the company doesn’t have a practice in dealing with the new amounts of phosphorus. A common knowledge is that a good refining of impurities is to a large part due of the slag. Therefor when it comes to improving dephosphorization there is a proposal to modify the slag slag benefiting removal of phosphor. This can be done by not adding dolomitic lime at LD converter. Dolomitic lime is added today at SSAB to reduce the wear of the LD converter linings composed of MgO. MgO from the linings has a tendency to dissolve in the slag and a method to prevent this is to saturate the slag with MgO by the addition of dolomitic lime. But the adding of dolomitic lime hastens the formation of tricalciumsilikates, 3 CaO·SiO 2 which inhibits the dissolve of lime. This thesis purpose was to investigate the dolomitic lime effect on dephosphorization by excluding it in the LD process. The goal with this work was to get a clear picture of the dephosphorization without the dolomitic lime and then based from this report develop a praxis for depshosphorization on steel grade that demands low phosphor. At SSAB a computer system is used to calculate a model on how the pig iron should be treated as for example how much lime and dolomitic lime must be added to reach the demands. During this thesis two different trials were done. The first trial in which dolomitic lime was removed from the computer system and the system calculated a model where the ordered requirements were met without adding dolomitic lime. The second trail was with a controlled blowing in which certain parameters were established in advance, for example the amount lime and dolomitic lime in the reference samples and then the amount lime in the trial samples. During the trials there were a desire to see the phosphorus behaviour during the entire blow, so samples were taken during the blowing as well as after. The results showed that the removal of dolomitic lime at LD converter contributed to improved phosphorus distribution but a controlled blowing method must be developed for it to have a clear impact. It has also been shown that a high FeO content in slag, high basicity and a low steel temperature contributes to a good phosphorus removal. By the results there is a marginal improvement of the dephosphorization by removing the dolomitic <b>lime</b> in the <b>blowing</b> of the pig iron. But the improvement came with a relativity large distribution and a more designed method to blow the pig iron must be developed to see a clearer improvement. Validerat; 20120207 (anonymous...|$|R
