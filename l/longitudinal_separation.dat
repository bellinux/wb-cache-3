30|$|The {{examples}} of EPIs presented in Fig.  2 {{show that the}} plasma irregularities usually have various scale sizes in the meridional direction, and these structures sometimes are not well correlated in the zonal direction. As shown in Fig.  5, the correlation rapidly decreases between neighboring measurements over tenths of a degree in longitude. With <b>longitudinal</b> <b>separations</b> larger than 0.4 ° (about 44  km), no significant correlation was found any more. This result suggests that small-scale structures within EPIs have short correlation lengths in longitude. Numerical model studies also report typical density depletion diameters of 20 – 30  km (e.g., Huba and Joyce 2007; Retterer 2010; Yokoyama et al. 2015). Swarm observational results can help to constrain the range of EPIs sizes in simulation studies.|$|R
30|$|In summary, the Swarm {{constellation}} mission {{provides us}} {{with the opportunity to}} study the scale sizes of equatorial plasma irregularities simultaneously in the meridional and zonal directions. We found that with <b>longitudinal</b> <b>separations</b> between Swarm satellites larger than 0.4 ° no significant correlation was found any more. This result suggests that EPI structures include plasma density scale sizes less than 44  km in the zonal direction. During the earlier mission period, clearly better correlations of EPIs are obtained in the northern hemisphere, implying more fragmented irregularities in the southern hemisphere where the ambient magnetic field is low. The previously reported inverted-C shell structure of EPIs is generally confirmed by the Swarm observations in the northern hemisphere, but with various tilt angles. From the Swarm spacecraft with zonal separations of about 150  km, we conclude that larger zonal scale sizes of irregularities exist in the early evening hours (around 1900 LT) that are interpreted as larger scale lengths, initial perturbations of post-sunset ionospheric plasma irregularities.|$|R

5000|$|This {{is not the}} {{shortest}} distance between the chosen endpoints on the parallel because a parallel {{is not a great}} circle. The difference is small for short distances but increases as λ, the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>separation,</b> increases. For two points, A and B, separated by 10° of longitude on the parallel at 60° the distance along the parallel is approximately 0.5 km greater than the great circle distance. (The distance AB along the parallel is (a cos φ) λ. The length of the chord AB is 2(a cos φ) sin [...] This chord subtends an angle at the centre equal to 2arcsin(cos φ sin [...] ) and the great circle distance between A and B is 2a arcsin(cos φ sin [...] ).) In the extreme case where the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>separation</b> is 180°, the distance along the parallel is one half of the circumference of that parallel; i.e., 10,007.5 km. On the other hand, the geodesic between these points is a great circle arc through the pole subtending an angle of 60° at the center: the length of this arc is one sixth of the great circle circumference, about 6,672 km. The difference is 3,338 km so the ruler distance measured from the map is quite misleading even after correcting for the latitude variation of the scale factor.|$|E
40|$|Renovation {{techniques}} such as use of liners to extend the lifetime of pipe networks are well established in the water industry. As well as spanning gaps and bridging holes, interactive liners are capable of surviving circumferential (or ring) failure, as may be experienced by distribution mains under flexural loading; movement of the host main following failure leads to tensile and shear displacements of the liner near the fracture. Experiments were carried out on cast iron host pipes containing a simulated transverse fracture, with thin-walled (similar to 3 mm) medium density polyethylene liners having a variety of longitudinal gaps. The fracture plane was subjected to shear displacements up to similar to 50 mm and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>separations</b> up to similar to 20 mm. Pipes were held at a pressure of 10 bar for about 12 days to allow creep deformation to take place, while {{the ability of the}} liner to withstand the applied displacement and separation was determined. It was demonstrated that the liner material investigated could withstand lateral deflections of the order of 50 mm for considerable periods of time. The implications of this finding on current design guidelines need further consideration. However, if the outcomes are favourable, this could lead to increased use of interactive liners, with potential benefits to both the water industry and the customer...|$|R

5000|$|The Zentrale Hauptverwaltung (ZHvDR—central headquarters) of Deutsche Reichsbahn {{was given}} the task of {{carrying}} out preliminary planning work at the Erfurt node on 18 August 1992. Planning work was then started. The preliminary planning documents were provided to ZHvDR for confirmation in mid-1993. They proposed a new electronic signalling centre, the renewal of 44 km tracks and 143 sets of points. 11 bridges in the urban area of Erfurt would be replaced or rehabilitated. The estimated cost of these measures was DM 439 million. The station was comprehensively modernised from 2002—after the demolition of the historical island building, which gave the station its appearance until then—and was officially {{handed over to the}} traffic on 13 December 2008, although not all reconstruction work had yet been completed. The cost of the reconstruction would amount to about €260 million. The Free State of Thuringia and the City of Erfurt would contribute €44 million of this. The planning approval for the reconstruction was given in the mid-1990s. The official groundbreaking was celebrated on 22 September 2001. The newly constructed track layout comprise 21 platform tracks at 12 platforms as well as 67 sets of points. Six railway bridges were built during the construction work. Underneath the station a shopping arcade has been built on an area of around 3,000 m². Underneath this shopping arcade is an underground car park. Both facilities were reduced in size during the planning phase. An open competition was held for the design of the new station. In the autumn of 1995, an eleven-member jury selected the winning plan for the station from a total of 123 submissions. Civil protests against the demolition of the historic island building, which was supported by a building historian of the Bauhaus University, Weimar, were not considered. Planning approval was given for the reconstruction of the railway node in September 1995. The planned measures included five kilometres of track, 46 kilometres of overhead wires and the renewal of eight railway bridges. The financing agreement for the reconstruction was concluded on 26 March 1998. The planned total costs were around DM 207 million. Work would start in the autumn of 1999 and be completed in 2003. An electronic interlocking for controlling the Erfurt rail node was put into operations {{before the start of the}} large-scale construction work on 14 March 1999. This replaced the eight relay, electro-mechanical and mechanical signal boxes, which were up to 92 years old and controlled by up to three train dispatchers, 155 sets of points, 154 signals and 119 repeater signals. This early completion had become necessary, as there was a ban had been placed on refurbishing the old signalling technology. Conceptually, the plan provided for a safety-related <b>longitudinal</b> <b>separation</b> of the station, in order to be able to carry out the rebuilding in stages. The electronic interlocking is now remote-controlled from the Leipzig signalling centre. In October 2001, Vieselbach and Hopfgarten stations and three block posts were also connected to the Erfurt electronic interlocking. The renovated entrance building went into operation on 21 August 2002 after eight months of construction. The construction works, which were then estimated to cost around €250 million were expected to be completed by 2006. The extensive reconstruction of Erfurt Hauptbahnhof started in 2002. A comprehensive redesign of the track layout was carried out as well as the demolition of part of the existing entrance building and the underpass of Bahnhofstraße. As a result of the rebuilding, Erfurt Hauptbahnhof will be able to operate as a junction between the Nuremberg-Erfurt and Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle high-speed lines. A major goal of the planning was to link the ICE line between Munich and Berlin with the ICE line between Frankfurt am Main and Dresden and to reduce travel times by means of interchange. In the meantime, the construction work was suspended for two years, when it was unclear whether the two high-speed lines projects connecting with Erfurt would be realised. The new station was built in several stages, as train operations had to be fully maintained. A provisional platform for the additional track 7a was first built on the south side of the station. An island platform with nine through tracks and four bay platforms were built. The two outside located long-distance platforms 1/2 and 9/10 have a length of 420 metres. The two-aisled, 154 metre long hall roof consists of one side aisle that has a 20 metre wide span and another side aisle that has 65 metre wide span, with a maximum height of around 20 metres. The originally planned length was 190 metres. During the rebuilding of the around 2.5 kilometre-long rail junction area, soundproof walls with a total length of around 3.0 kilometres were also installed. The converted entrance hall was opened in 2005 as a first part of the new railway station. The north side of the main station was officially put into operation at the timetable change in December 2005. It consisted of a [...] "half" [...] glass hall on the upper floor, which spans the newly opened northern island platform with tracks 1 and 2 and partly the middle platform, as well as a shopping arcade on the ground floor and an underground car park. At this time, the planned total costs were €260 million. These funds were supplied by the state of Thuringia, the city of Erfurt and Deutsche Bahn. The next section was opened on 3 June 2007. Working to a 44-hour limit, the northern part of the platform with track 3 as well as the four new tracks 4 and 5 on the eastern platform and 6 and 7 on the western platform were put into operation. In the last phase of construction, the old southern part of the track area (old tracks 5, 6, 7 and 7a), including the old pedestrian overbridge, were demolished by March 2008. Then the rest of the glass roof construction and the platforms underneath were built with tracks 8, 9 and 10. Commissioning took place on 30 November 2008 after a 27-hour total blockade. In the process, the southern long-distance platform 9 was put into operation, first as a 320 metre-long bay platform without overhead wire, and platform 10 was opened with a provisional connection until two subsequent bridge structures were completed in the eastern exit. At the end of May 2012, in a 64-hour possession, additional tracks for the high-speed lines were integrated east and west of the station with a length of 12 kilometres. The platforms 9/10 were now connected in both directions and its full length of 420 metres was usable as an ICE platform. In addition, the new southern entrance to the Flutgraben was handed over and the waiting room was redesigned. A crossing structure was built east of the station in Daberstedt to allow trains on the high-speed to Leipzig to pass over the tracks of the lines from Sangerhausen and Wolkramshausen. At Pentecost 2013, the structure was put into operation during a further blockade of the node. The commissioning of five tracks in the western part of the station took place at that time. A total of nine full possessions are planned for the integration of the two new lines. A total of €336 million had been invested up to May 2012 of the total estimated cost of €480 million. Several dozen companies and more than 300 people were involved in the project (as of August 2014). The station was fully blockaded from 20 to 22 November 2015 for the commissioning of additional tracks. Two further construction stages, each requiring a full possession, are still outstanding. At the end of November 2017, a blockade is foreseen for the installation of a new software version of the ETCS. After the completion of the work, the running speed will be raised to 100 km/h. In a second stage of construction, the line from Eisenach is to be connected with the high-speed lines to Leipzig. Due to a lack of funds, this is only an option for which appropriate land has been reserved. Located in the area of the station are two of the three electronic interlocking subcentres (Erfurt and Erfurt NBS), Erfurt Knoten and Erfurt Neubaustrecke, as well as two of the five ETCS Radio Block Centres of the new high-speed lines, being built under German Unity Transport Project No. 8 (Verkehrsprojekt Deutsche Einheit Nr. 8). These facilities are housed in a modular building on the north side of the freight station.|$|E

LRO s near-polar orbit results in very high data density {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the lunar poles, which are each sampled every ~ 2 h. With more than 10, 000 orbits, high-resolution maps can be constructed [4] and studied [5]. However, this requires careful processing of the raw data, as subtle errors in the spacecraft position and pointing can lead to visible artifacts in the final map. In other locations on the Moon, ground tracks are subparallel and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>separations</b> are typically a few hundred meters. Near the poles, the track intersection angles can be large and the inter-track spacing is small (above 80 latitude, the effective resolution is better than 50 m). Precision Orbit Determination (POD) of the LRO spacecraft [6] was performed to satisfy the LOLA and LRO mission requirements, which lead to a significant improvement in the orbit position knowledge over the short-release navigation products. However, with pixel resolutions of 10 to 25 meters, artifacts due to orbit reconstruction still exist. Here, we show how the complete LOLA dataset at both poles can be adjusted geometrically to produce a high-accuracy, high-resolution maps with minimal track artifacts. We also describe how those maps can then feedback to the POD work, by providing topographic base maps with which individual LOLA altimetric measurements can be contributing to orbit changes. These direct altimetry constraints improve accuracy and can be used more simply than the altimetric crossovers [6]...|$|R

The influence of displacement on resistance has been evaluated by testing the models for three different displacements...|$|R
40|$|Phenomenal {{growth in}} air traffic {{across the world}} is leading {{industries}} to maximize the use of airspace. One of the promising approaches would be to optimize the utilization of information derived from existing data. In early period, all air traffic rules can be programmed and integrated to the system using a general-purpose language like C#, C++, or Java. To increase sustainability of the system, general-purpose languages are too complicated for the users to understand and maintain. In addition, general purpose languages have to be recompiled every time the code has been changed. This research has developed a domain specific language called Aeronautical Rules Script Language (ARSL). The language is particularly designed for collaborative environment aiming at determining separation minima required between aircrafts at planning phase. ARSL {{can be used as}} a formal language for configuring air traffic rules and information sharing. As a domain specific language, ARSL is easy to understand and maintain for aeronautical domain experts. The language has been implemented and integrated into the Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) project of Aeronautical Radio of Thailand to help integrate the major elements essential for defining safety <b>longitudinal</b> aircraft <b>separation.</b> The evaluation results show that the implemented ARSL and its services function accurately, providing the same answers as obtained from the specialist...|$|R
