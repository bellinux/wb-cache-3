The {{purpose of this study was}} twofold: to trace the history and provisions of the Illinois Tenure Teacher <b>Hearing</b> <b>Officer</b> Act and to analyze the application of that act to the dismissal of tenure teachers in the state of Illinois. The researcher treated specifically tenure dismissal cases that were concluded prior to the time dismissal proceedings reached the <b>hearing</b> <b>officer</b> level. The researcher treated the history and provisions of the Illinois Tenure Teacher <b>Hearing</b> <b>Officer</b> Act in Chapter 2, Review of Related Literature. Data were gathered concerning application of the Illinois Tenure Teacher <b>Hearing</b> <b>Officer</b> Act to the dismissal of tenure teachers in Illinois from a questionnaire developed by the researcher. A total of 799 of the 1, 012 public school superintendents in the state of Illinois responded to the researcher's questionnaire. A tabulation of the returned questionnaires revealed that 643 of the 799 respondents had had no involvement with tenure teachers dismissal cases. Since the data from these 643 respondents had no bearing otherwise on this study, they were not analyzed further. One hundred fifty-six of the 799 respondents indicated that they had had some level of involvement with tenure teacher dismissal cases. It was these 156 respondents who formed the sample group for data analysis reported in Chapter 4. The principal findings in this study are: (1) A majority of Illinois public school district superintendents have had no involvement with tenure teacher dismissal cases. (2) A majority of tenure teacher dismissal cases reported by responding Illinois public school district superintendents were settled prior to the <b>hearing</b> <b>officer</b> stage of the Illinois Tenure Teacher <b>Hearing</b> <b>Officer</b> Act. (3) Based on frequency of responses, patterns of settlement appear to be developing when these settlement patterns are compared to demographic characteristics of Illinois public school districts...|$|R

2500|$|A {{doctor was}} {{allegedly}} subject to multiple hearings {{for the same}} charges, and his rights to an expedited hearing were allegedly denied while a suspension was in place.

[...] The {{court ruled that the}} <b>hearing</b> <b>officer</b> in the case could indeed terminate the physician's peer review hearing based on grounds that the physician refused to cooperate on procedural and other matters necessary for the good conduct of the proceedings.

[...] The <b>hearing</b> <b>officer</b> in that case also terminated the proceedings, this time due to the physician's failure to turn over certain evidence for use in the hearing.
