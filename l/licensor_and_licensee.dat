40|$|Licensing {{agreements}} {{can exist}} between established companies but they increasingly also {{give rise to}} start-up companies, built around the licensed technology. Licensing-out technology can represent a risk {{as well as an}} opportunity for any licensor as there is a trade-off between additional revenues that can be gained from the licensing agreement and the costs related to the transfer itself, as well as the risks of opportunism by the licensee. When licensing to a start-up, this risk is higher, as start-ups have scarce resources, high failure rates and no past performance on which to gauge the start-up’s success. For the start-up the license could also represent a risk in the form of sunk costs and constraints on their evolution path. This paper discusses under which conditions technology licensing between a licensor and a start-up can be beneficial to both parties. Through a qualitative analysis, interviewing a number of European start-ups, we will examine in particular the role of contractual clauses, the relationship between <b>licensor</b> <b>and</b> <b>licensee,</b> the role of the licensed technology in the final product and the role of a technology push versus demand-pull scenario in a licensing deal.

Licensing is the process of leasing a legally protected entity (brand, name, logo, etc.) in conjunction with a product or product line.

Licensing is seen as a win-win strategy, in which the two partners can achieve their objectives (e. g., expanding the brand, its market reach, etc.). We show that, if the licensor, who acts as the leader, uses an incentive strategy that depends on the licensee advertising, then it can reach the jointly optimal solution in a decentralized way...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{contributes}} to the fundamental discussion of setting optimal liabilities in restitution law by analyzing the effects that the existing multitude of indemnification rules for patent infringements have on innovative and imitative activity. From a theoretical legal standpoint, the choice of patent law is particularly enlightening due to its hybrid public and private nature. From an economic perspective its relevance lies in regulating the driving forces of welfare in highly industrialized societies. Our analysis of regulations from six different jurisdictions (US, JP, DE, UK, FR, NL) reveals that from a scholarly standpoint none of the regulations sets optimal liabilities in general. Our major finding is that an expectation damage rule based on a renegotiation outcome from an ex-ante perspective (falling in between the generic legal notions of ‘lost profits’ and ‘infringer’s profits’) between <b>licensor</b> <b>and</b> <b>licensee</b> appears optimal in patent infringement cases to avoid dynamic inefficiencies. The result is intuitive, however, was not predicted by the existing literature on indemnification law.

40|$|Licensing {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} observed inter-firm contractual agreements. Drawing on the resource-based view of the firm and contract economics, e argue that the inclusion of a grant-back clause in licensing agreements emerges as a consequence of the <b>licensor</b> <b>and</b> <b>licensee</b> firms‘ requirements to balance the need to protect their technological resources with the need to learn through internal and external processes. We argue that licensing agreements are increasingly likely to contain a grant-back clause (i) the closer the licensed technology is to the core of the licensor‘s patent portfolio, and (ii) the higher the uncertainty of the licensed technology. In contrast, we conjecture decreasing likelihood of a grant-back clause, the closer the licensed technology is to the core of the licensee‘s patent portfolio. Technological uncertainty is conjectured to positively moderate the results both when the licensed technology is part of the core technology of the licensee and the licensor. We test our hypotheses using a sample of 404 licensed technologies over the period 1984 - 2004. We employ a hierarchical nested decision model to account for the inclusion of a grant-back clause in a licensing contract nested in the decision about which technologies to license out. We find broad support for our theoretical arguments...|$|E

Following an outline of the complexity of the NST concept attention is given to the licensing process. <b>Licensor</b> <b>and</b> <b>licensee</b> are key actors for conducting the licensing process. Highly competent technologists are needed for and active role in the process: this may require life experience in specific subjects. The availability of such personnel is difficult to be gathered by any individual company or institution, whatever licensor or licensee. This is true even in Countries where nuclear technology was developed soon after the second World War. The same condition to engage life-experts for each specific licensing subject is almost unreachable in Countries where the exploitation of nuclear technology started later or, anyway, in small Countries. Deep expertise is also required when an innovative nuclear installation is designed and put in operation. As a consequence of all of this, either the actual licensing processes are not performed according to the best practice available at the international level, or the cost of the process, i. e. of involving top level expertise in each licensing subject, may become prohibitive. The bases are put to constitute a Consortium of Competence in Nuclear Technology (COCONUT) where the key licensing subjects are identified and the life-experts for each subject are cooperating.

40|$|Information {{from the}} Human Genome Project is being {{integrated}} into the drug discovery and development process to permit novel drug targets to be identified, clinical trial testing to be made more efficient, and efficacious therapeutics to be approved and made widely available. Knowledge of the genome will allow for the description and quantification of disease and susceptibility to disease as informational errors or deficits. The creation and application of knowledge occur through cooperative or competitive interactions, often reflecting the perceived value of the knowledge. The public or private value of the knowledge, both for itself and for potential applications, can be determined through {{an understanding of the}} classification and characterization of this knowledge, as well as the position of the knowledge within the drug discovery and development pipeline. The transformation of knowledge from a purely public good to a quasi-private good has highlighted the need for balance between incentives for the market provision of scientific and technological knowledge by an innovator and incentives for the market provision of incremental knowledge by a follow-on developer. It has been suggested that a patent system developed for a discrete model of innovation may no longer be optimal for an information-based, cumulative model of innovation. Consequently, it is necessary to reanalyze models of intellectual property protection and strategies of knowledge sharing in biopharmaceutical discovery research. Under certain conditions, the biotech commons is an efficient institution that can preserve downstream opportunities for multiple researchers fairly and efficiently. A framework for classifying and characterizing discovery knowledge is developed in this research and the role of research consortia in preserving the biotech commons is analyzed.

40|$|This essay, which {{builds on}} my recent {{work on the}} law and {{economics}} of comparative patent remedies, presents three proposals relating to the enforcement of domestic patent rights. The first, which may be close to being adopted in the United States, is for {{the courts and the}} International Trade Commission (ITC) to adopt a general presumption, grounded in patent law and policy, that patent owners who have committed to license their standard essential patents (SEPs) on fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory terms are not entitled to permanent injunctions or exclusion orders, but rather only to a damages {{in the form of an}} ongoing royalty calculated on the basis of what a reasonable <b>licensor</b> <b>and</b> <b>licensee</b> would have agreed to prior to the adoption of the standard in question. Countries such as Germany that have addressed the issue of remedies for the infringement of SEPs within the context of competition law, while otherwise leaving in place an almost-automatic entitlement to permanent injunctive relief, have in my view taken the wrong tack. Second, I argue that Congress should amend Patent Act § 289, which permits design patent owners to recover the infringer’s profits, so as to require that such awards reflect only the profit derived from the use of the infringed design (and not the entire product of which the design is a part). Such apportionment is the norm in other countries (and in U. S. copyright and trademark law). By contrast, the archaic U. S. design patent rule threatens substantial overdeterrence and overcompensation, as reflected in the recent jury award in Apple v. Samsung. My third suggestion — really more of a thought experiment inspired by Judge Posner’s opinion in Apple v. Motorola than a serious proposal for reform — is to consider whether it would be possible to eliminate the unique U. S. practice of trial by jury in a wide swath of U. S. patent cases by statutorily recasting awards of reasonable royalties as a form of equitable restitution rather than as compensation...|$|E
