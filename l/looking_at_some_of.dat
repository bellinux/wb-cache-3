[...] Most scientific interest in supernovae—as standard candles for measuring distance, for example—require an observation of their peak luminosity. It is therefore important to discover them well before they reach their maximum. Amateur astronomers, who greatly outnumber professional astronomers, have {{played an important role}} in finding supernovae, typically by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the closer galaxies through an optical telescope and comparing them to earlier photographs.|$|E

I was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> your old likenesses the other day; and I declare that it is enough to make a man cry to look at your face now and listen to your voice.

How sorry Thomas must have been!" [...] This representation served to fill the vacant seats for some time to come.|$|E

Within the last {{fortnight}} I heard the error attributed to the players made by an English scholar who is foremost in his own field of learning. He and I were <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Dickens's MSS. They were full of erasions and corrections. I said, [...] "How unlike Scott!" [...] whose first draft of his novels exactly answered to the players' description of Will's [...] "copy." [...] My friend said, [...] "Browning scarcely made an erasion or change in writing his poems," [...] and referred to Mr. Browning's MSS. for the press, of which examples were lying near us. [...] "But Browning must have made clean copies for the press," [...] I said: which was as new an idea to my learned friend as it was undreamed of by the Players:- if what they received from him were his clean copies.|$|E

He said that after Lady Hastings went off in the car the general asked him to take coffee {{with him in the}} library and look up a point about local antiquities. He himself was beginning to look for Budge's book in one of the revolving bookstands when the general found it in one of the bookshelves on the wall. After <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the plates they went out, it would seem, rather abruptly, on to the links, and walked toward the old well; and while Boyle was looking into it he heard a thud behind him, and turned round to find the general lying as we found him. He himself dropped on his knees to examine the body, and then was paralyzed with a sort of terror and could not come nearer to it or touch it. But I think very little of that; people caught in a real shock of surprise are sometimes found in the queerest postures." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{need not}} make any comment upon the subtle {{difference}} of eight inches on twenty feet between {{the second and third}} dimensions. If the reader will be at the pains to compare the whole evidence now laid before him, with that deduced above from the apse of Murano, he cannot but confess that it amounts to an irrefragable proof of an intense perception of harmony in the relation of quantities, {{on the part of the}} Byzantine architects; a perception which we have at present lost so utterly as hardly to be able even to conceive it. And let it not be said, as it was of the late discoveries of subtle curvature in the Parthenon,[45] that what is not to be demonstrated without laborious measurement, cannot have influence on the beauty of the design. The eye is continually influenced by what it cannot detect; nay, it is not going too far to say, that it is most influenced by what it detects least. Let the painter define, if he can, the variations of lines on which depend the changes of expression in the human countenance. The greater he is, the more he will feel their subtlety, and the intense difficulty of perceiving all their relations, or answering for the consequences of a variation of a hair's breadth in a single curve. Indeed, there is nothing truly noble either in color or in form, but its power depends on circumstances infinitely too intricate to be explained, and almost too subtle to be traced. And as for these Byzantine buildings, we only do not feel them because we do not watch them; otherwise we should as much enjoy the variety of proportion in their arches, as we do at present that of the natural architecture of flowers and leaves. Any of us can feel in an instant the grace of the leaf group, b, in the annexed figure; and yet that grace is simply owing to its being proportioned like the façade of St. Mark's; each leaflet answering to an arch,--the smallest at the root, to those of the porticos. I have tried to give the proportion quite accurately in b; but as the difference between the second and third leaflets is hardly discernible on so small a scale, it is somewhat exaggerated in a.[46] Nature is often far more subtle in her proportions. In <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the nobler species of lilies, full in the front of the flower, we may fancy for a moment that they form a symmetrical six-petaled star; but on examining them more closely, we shall find that they are thrown into a group of three magnitudes by the expansion of two of the inner petals above the stamens to a breadth greater than any of the four others; while the third inner petal, on which the stamens rest, contracts itself into the narrowest of the six, and the three under petals remain of one intermediate magnitude, as seen in the annexed figure.|$|E
