A source of pressurized gas (<b>leak</b> <b>test</b> <b>gas</b> or motive gas) is selected by a valve, regulated {{to a desired}} pressure by a regulator, and routed through an ejector (venturi device). A regulated source of water vapor {{in the form of}} steam from a heated reservoir is coupled to a low pressure region of the ejector which mixes with high velocity gas flow through the ejector. This mixture is sampled by a dew point sensor to obtain dew point thereof (ratio of water vapor to gas) and the apparatus adjusted by varying gas pressure or water vapor to provide a mixture at a connector having selected humidity content...|$|E

40|$|In {{the fall}} of 2010, Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) {{contracted}} with vendors to design and build 6 CVS containment vessels {{as part of their}} effort to ship Fuel Derived Mixed Fission Product material. The 6 CVS design is based on the Savannah River National Laboratory's (SRNL) design for 9975 and 9977 six inch diameter containment vessels. The main difference between the designs is that the 6 CVS credits the inner O-ring seal as the containment boundary while the SRNL design credits the outer O-ring seal. Since the <b>leak</b> <b>test</b> must be done with the inner O-ring in place, the containment vessel does not have a pathway for getting the helium into the vessel during the <b>leak</b> <b>test.</b> The <b>leak</b> <b>testing</b> contractor was not able to get acceptable leak rates with the specified O-ring, but they were able to pass the <b>leak</b> <b>test</b> with a slightly larger O-ring. ANL asked the SRNL to duplicate the <b>leak</b> <b>test</b> vendor's method to determine the cause of the high leak rates. The SRNL testing showed that the helium leak indications were caused by residual helium left within the 6 CVS Closure Assembly by the <b>leak</b> <b>test</b> technique, and by helium permeation through the Viton O-ring seals. After SRNL completed their <b>tests,</b> the <b>leak</b> <b>testing</b> contractor was able to measure acceptable leak rates by using the slightly larger O-ring size, by purging helium from the lid threads, and by being very quick in getting the bell jar under a full vacuum. This paper describes the <b>leak</b> <b>test</b> vendor's test technique, and other techniques that could be have been used to successfully <b>leak</b> <b>test</b> the 6 CVS's...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} the Hermicity Tests in detail. Hermeticity testing is {{a technology that}} deals with the transfer of media (gasses) {{in and out of}} sealed enclosures based on vacuum science, physics, and chemistry. The chapter aims to establish an understanding of the different seal test methodologies for MEMS packages. The hermeticity classes are explained. Method for measuring package and seal Integrity using helium as the tracer gas defines and quantifies these classes differently but uses the same wording. Only three nondestructive <b>leak</b> <b>tests</b> possess high enough measurement sensitivity for modern inertial sensors. The relevant hermeticity tests for MEMs packages are membrane resonance, Kr 85 radioactive tracer <b>gas</b> <b>tests,</b> optical deformation, internal pressure measurement, helium <b>leak</b> <b>test,</b> IR transmission tests, and Q factor monitoring. The neon ultra-fine <b>leak</b> <b>test</b> is an elaborated hermeticity test environment with a dedicated vacuum prediction model (vacuum lif etime model) based on quality factor monitoring of micro resonating devices. The neon ultra-fine <b>leak</b> <b>test</b> procedure for a new device starts with measuring a calibration curve for Q factor over a relevant pressure range, using selected open devices. The calculation regarding the vacuum lifetime model can be done easily in an analytical way such as cavity with ideal getter and getter saturation. The calculation will be much easier if we can assume molecular flow in the hole leak channel...|$|R

The objective of this thesis is {{to design and fabricate}} a <b>leak</b> <b>test</b> rig. The thesis describes the approaches of designing and fabricating a <b>leak</b> <b>test</b> rig. There are numerous steps taken to design and fabricate the test rig. The structural three-dimensional solid modelling design of test rig was developed by using the Solidwork engineering drawing software. The fabrication process also undergoes many steps such as material marking, cutting, drilling, welding and grinding. In addition, it also explains the procedure of testing by the simulation of three types of common leakages which includes pinhole, pipe crack/dent and gasket <b>leak.</b> The <b>testing</b> the rig is also explained in this thesis by maintaining a pressure of 4 bars in the test rig to prove whether the test rig is functioning efficiently.

The leak detection system employs a computer controlled helium detector which allows an operator to enter key information when prompted.

Recertification Test: Every twelve months, the pressure vessel portion of the shipping container itself must undergo a rigorous recertification <b>leak</b> <b>test.</b> After an empty pressure vessel (shipping container) is assembled, it is placed into one of six stainless steel belljars for helium <b>leak</b> <b>testing.</b> The belljars are fashioned in row {{much the same as}} assembly line arrangement.

40|$|This {{document}} {{provides a}} plan and schedule for <b>leak</b> <b>testing</b> {{a portion of the}} Liquid Low-Level Waste (LLLW) system at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, Tennessee. It is a concise version of a more general <b>leak</b> <b>testing</b> plan that was prepared in response to the requirements of the Federal Facility Agreement (FFA) for the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR). This plan includes a schedule for the initial reporting of the <b>leak</b> <b>test</b> results from the various tanks that will be tested. The FFA distinguishes four categories of tank and pipeline systems: new systems (Category A), doubly contained systems (Category B), singly contained systems (Category C), and inactive systems (Category D). The FFA specifically requires <b>leak</b> <b>testing</b> of the Category C systems; there are 14 such tanks addressed in this plan, plus one tank (W- 12) that has been temporarily returned to service based on EPA and TDEC concurrence. A schedule for testing these tanks is also included. The plan and schedule also addresses an additional 15 Category B tanks have been demonstrated to meet secondary containment requirements. While these 15 tanks are addressed in this plan for the sake of completeness, they have been removed from the <b>leak</b> <b>testing</b> program based on the design demonstrations that show secondary containment. It is noted that the general plan included 42 tanks. Since that report was issued, 26 of those tanks have passed secondary containment design demonstrations and subsequently have been removed from this <b>leak</b> <b>testing</b> plan. In addition, one tank (LA- 104) has been removed from service. Accordingly, this document addresses 15 of the LLLW tanks in the system; plans for testing the pipelines will be described in a separate document...|$|R
40|$|The figure schematically {{depicts a}} {{portable}} microleak-detection {{system that has}} been built especially for use in testing hydrogen tanks made of polymer-matrix composite materials. (As used here, microleak signifies a leak that {{is too small to}} be detectable by the simple soap-bubble technique.) The system {{can also be used to}} test for microleaks in tanks that are made of other materials and that contain gases other than hydrogen. Results of calibration tests have shown that measurement errors are less than 10 percent for leak rates ranging from 0. 3 to 200 cm 3 /min. Like some other microleak-detection systems, this system includes a vacuum pump and associated plumbing for sampling the leaking gas, and a mass spectrometer for analyzing the molecular constituents of the gas. The system includes a flexible vacuum chamber that can be attached to the outer surface of a tank or other object of interest that is to be tested for leakage (hereafter denoted, simply, the <b>test</b> object). The <b>gas</b> used in a test can be the gas or vapor (e. g., hydrogen in the original application) to be contained by the test object. Alternatively, following common practice in <b>leak</b> <b>testing,</b> helium can be used as a <b>test</b> <b>gas.</b> In either case, the mass spectrometer can be used to verify that the gas measured by the system is the <b>test</b> <b>gas</b> rather than a different gas and, hence, that the leak is indeed from the test object...|$|R
