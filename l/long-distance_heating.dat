5000|$|Two {{power station}} units {{present on the}} {{location}} were beaconed up to their shut-down with oil. The power produced in the power station Scholven covers about 3% of the German current need. The units B - E, the <b>long-distance</b> <b>heating</b> power station Buer (FWK) and the steam work Scholven (DWS) supply steam to neighbouring chemistry enterprises and <b>long-distance</b> <b>heating</b> to some surrounding cities. The 302 metre high chimneys, which are the second highest in Germany, form an impressing industrial skyline together with the 7 cooling towers. The power station area and the neighbouring waste dump of the coal mine Scholven became a film scene in the Tatort [...] "The ball in the body" [...] of 1979.|$|E

The present heat pipe is a closed loop, which consists of a heated section (evaporator), a cooled section (condenser), a reservoir, valves and pipes connecting these components. The experimental results confirm that the heat pipe works periodically corresponding to the valve operation, and the heat is transported sideward continuously from the heated section to the cooled section. The vapor-pressure-driven heat pipe is effective for a large-scale thermal management...|$|R

Beside the conventional, an {{the surface of the earth}} occuring generation of process steam, a little HTR can be inserted as heat source in the frame of the nuclear <b>long-distance</b> <b>heat</b> systems. The steam generation ensues very close to the oil deposit during the exothermal methanation process. For this special application of the HTR concepts for steam injection were developed with inside-cooled methanation plants. Two reference-plants were chosen and their components were designed.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic feasibility {{of the application}} of the ammonia-water absorption system for heat or cold transportation over long distance. A model of a <b>long-distance</b> <b>heat</b> energy transportation system is built and analyzed, and it shows satisfactory and attractive results. When a steam heat source at the temperature of 120 °C is available, the user site can get hot water output at about 55 °C with the thermal COP of about 0. 6 and the electric COP of about 100 in winter, and cold water output at about 8 °C with the thermal COP of about 0. 5 and the electric COP of 50 in summer. A small-size prototype is built to verify the performance analysis. Basically the experimental data show good accordance with the analysis results. The ammonia-water absorption system is a potential prospective solution for the heat or cold transportation over long distance. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|International audienceHeat {{transport}} {{over large}} distances is classically performed with gravity or capillarity driven heat pipes. We investigate here whether the “piston effect,” a thermalization {{process that is}} very efficient in weightlessness in compressible fluids, {{could also be used}} to perform <b>long-distance</b> <b>heat</b> transfer. Experiments are performed in a modeling heat pipe 16. 5 mm long, 3 mm inner diameter closed cylinder, with nearly adiabatic polymethylmethacrylate walls and two copper base plates. The cell is filled with H 2 near its gas-liquid critical point critical temperature: 33 K. Weightlessness is achieved by submitting the fluid to a magnetic force that compensates gravity. Initially the fluid is isothermal. Then heat is sent to one of the bases with an electrical resistance. The instantaneous amount of heat transported by the fluid is measured at the other end. The data are analyzed and compared with a two-dimensional numerical simulation that allows an extrapolation to be made to other fluids e. g., CO 2, with critical temperature of 300 K. The major result is concerned with the existence of a very fast response at early times that is only limited by the thermal properties of the cell materials. The yield in terms of ratio, injected or transported heat power, does not exceed 10 – 30 % and is limited by the heat capacity of the pipe. These results are valid in a large temperature domain around the critical temperature...|$|R
5000|$|In {{his book}} Why We Run: A Natural History (originally titled [...] "Racing the Antelope"), Heinrich {{reflected}} on the sport of running as a scientist, and recounted his performance in the 100 kilometer race that ushered in his ultra-marathon career. Combining his expertise as a physiologist, comparative animal biologist specializing in exercise and temperature regulation, and runner, he posits that the unique human capacity for <b>long-distance</b> running in <b>heat</b> is a human adaptation similar to running adaptations in other animals. Another argument of the book was that humans evolved to be ultra-distance runners that could run down even the swiftest prey, {{through a combination of}} endurance, intelligence, and the desire to win (c.f. Persistence hunting).|$|R
50|$|Lünen Power Station is a {{coal-fired}} power station in Germany. It's located in Lünen in the district Unna. It has an output capacity of 500 megawatts. The first power station in Lünen was commissioned in 1938. The power station produces traction current since 1984 also. The power station has also been producing <b>long-distance</b> <b>heating</b> since late 2003. Annual coal consumption amounts to 960,000 tons. The operator of the power station is Evonik Industries.

Armstrong 2 FACSM. 1 Human Performance Laboratory, Department of Health, Human Performance, and Recreation, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR.; 2 Human Performance Laboratory, Department of Kinesiology, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT. Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that both <b>long-distance</b> running and <b>heat</b> exposure are associated with high incidence of occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. However, it is not clear wether prolonged non-impact exercise in the heat is associated with GI problems, which has been proposed as a predisposing factor for heat stroke. PURPOSE: The purpose of this research was to determine if competing in a 160 -km cycling event in the heat has any effect on gastrointestinal bleeding. METHODS: Twenty-five experienced cyclists (21 men and 4 women; 49 ± 9 y; 1. 77 ± 0. 07 m; 83. 7 ± 14. 8 kg) were recruited during a summer 160 -km cycling event (Hotter ‘n Hell Hundred). Immediately following the race, participants were given a fecal occult blood test and were instructed to retrieve their first bowel movement. One week following the race, participants were asked a series of questions regarding their GI discomforts. RESULTS: Environmental conditions for race day were 35. 3 ± 5. 0 °C and 47. 2 ± 14. 5 % RH. Average finishing time for the participants was 6. 58 ± 1. 22 h. Of the 25 cyclists participating in the study, two of them had positive results for fecal occult blood and GI distress, while two more experienced either constipation, hard stools, diarrhea or vomiting. CONCLUSION: These data showed a low incidence of gastrointestinal complaints and occult bleeding during a prolonged cycling event in the heat, indicating the low-impact exercise like cycling may attenuate some of the occult gastrointestinal bleeding previously reported in distance running in the heat...|$|R
50|$|Leopold Lummerstorfer {{is one of}} {{the younger}} {{directors}} of the new Austrian cinema. As early as 19, he made his first long film “My Country in Pink”, an adventurous feature with underground, cult character. He studied ethnology and philosophy at the University of Vienna, worked in very diverse occupations such as road construction worker, journalist, estate manager, <b>long-distance</b> <b>heating</b> supervisor and youth social worker. Parallel to this, he made a set of short features as well as documentary films, including “The Dream That Remains”, a film “that goes from a social study to a gentle, true satire without much effort. A surprise success for domestic cinema, in artistic value and in public numbers and a politically alert as well as amusing film” (Die Presse). His films usually highlight a social focus, which he brings to the screen, documentarily or fictionally, by means of accurate narrative structure. His last feature, “White Cherries” (with Martin Puntigam, Josef Hader, and Maria Hofstätter), was acclaimed as the, up to then, most successful new generation film in Austrian cinema. His work has received numerous festival invitations (among others, San Francisco, São Paulo, Saarbruecken, Istanbul, Cinéma du réel Paris) and awards. Leopold Lummerstorfer lives in Vienna, where he also now regularly directs the ORF feature, “Show without a Name”, an individual youth format with most satisfying viewer numbers, also above the 50.|$|E
40|$|The {{town called}} Weisswasser with about 31. 000 {{inhabitants}} {{is located in}} the northeast of the free state Saxon. The brown coal industry, the manufacture and process of glass and other local industry and trade estates are characteristic of this industrial site. The marginal conditions regarding the local energy demand, the provision of energy from production plants, the waste heat potentials of the industry that can be developed, the realized changeover to naturalgas and the plan of development and use of space that has been confirmed, have changed. This required an updated conception in order to inspect the data basis and suggest new developing strategies. Special conditions of Weisswasser are that 70 % of the flats are connected with the <b>long-distance</b> <b>heating</b> system and the supply of the energy-intensive glass industry. Considering these special conditions a conception for the further development of the power supply and the use and provision of the sources of energy has been developed. The following plans are already in realization: - coupling the <b>long-distance</b> <b>heating</b> out of the power station Boxberg, - exending and reconstructing the long-distance heating-, gas- and power supply works, as well as the intended power-heat coldness coupling, - gas turbines ('HKW') with use of the waste heat in the glass factory, - 'BHKW'-facility in the ice-sport complex, with these steps we will reach the goal of creating an ecologically friendly and safe power supply with a maximum saving of energy as well as a provision of energy which is cost-effective, climatic tolerated and resource economical.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{temperature}} field evolving in the limestone around the district heating tunnel in Copenhagen due to {{operation of the}} <b>long-distance</b> <b>heating</b> pipelines is investigated by means of poro-hydro-thermal numerical analyses. The presented parametric studies illustrate the coupling between the temperature and the groundwater flow. It is shown how a general horizontal groundwater flow and the hydraulic permeability of the surrounding ground influence the distribution and magnitude of the temperature. The {{results of the study}} can be generalised and indicate in which situations a pure conduction analysis without consideration of pore water flow is adequate and when a full conduction/convection analysis is necessary to obtain realistic results for the {{temperature field}} around heated tunnels. The significance of the temperature elevation for the structural design of the segmental tunnel lining is highlighted. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a case-study {{of an ongoing}} court case between the Swedish Competition Agency and Växjö Municipality about a set-up {{requirement}} to the <b>long-distance</b> <b>heating</b> system for newly built private houses on municipality owned land. This requirement was set up {{as part of the}} municipality’s long-term environmental goals; however the Competition Agency claims that the demand is damaging the free market in the municipality. The purpose of this thesis is to determine which normative assumptions the decision makers have based their actions and re-action on, and whether or not these assumptions are valid, thru theoretical ideal types. This is determined via method of textual analysis. Political theory regarding Liberalism, Utilitarianism, Ecology, Freedom and Exorcise of Power {{are all part of the}} theoretical framework.   After concluded study it is possible to say that the two plenipotentiary powers operate under different ideological assumptions and an understanding between them will be a difficult task, but none the less an important one for the possibility of future long-term environmental policies, both in the municipality of Växjö and the county of Sweden as a whole. ...|$|E
