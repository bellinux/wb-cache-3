5|$|The {{witnesses}} took {{ten hours}} to testify, {{during which time}} the court sat continuously. After a short break, the judge began his summing up, taking two hours to charge the jury. The judge urged the jury to put their prejudice at hearing that Thornton had sex with Ashford out of their heads; they were here to determine if Thornton was guilty of the offence charged. He pointed out to the jury the lack of concealment exhibited by Thornton, his admission of the sexual act and of being with Ashford until 4a.m. The judge told them {{it was not possible}} for Thornton to have committed the acts alleged by the prosecution and still have made it to the Holden farm {{by the time he was}} seen by Heydon, and stressed that Thornton did not act <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> ran. The judge concluded by reminding the jury that it was better a murderer go free than an innocent man be convicted.|$|E
500|$|Zhuangzi {{seems to}} have viewed death as a natural process or transformation, where one gives up one form of {{existence}} and assumes another. In the second chapter, he makes the point that, for all humans know, death {{may in fact be}} better than life: [...] "How do I know that loving life is not a delusion? How do I know that in hating death I am not <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who,</b> having left home in his youth, has forgotten the way back?" [...] His writings teach that [...] "the wise man or woman accepts death with equanimity and thereby achieves absolute happiness." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{remainder}} of Rome's territory--if not its nature--was defended {{for several decades}} following 410 AD largely by Flavius Aëtius, who managed to play off each of Rome's barbarian invaders against one another. In 436 AD he led a Hunnic army against the Visigoths at the Battle of Arles, and again in 436 AD at the Battle of Narbonne. In 451 AD he led a combined army, including his former enemy the Visigoths, against the Huns at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains, beating them so soundly that although they later sacked Concordia, Altinum, Mediolanum, Ticinum, and Patavium, they never again directly threatened Rome. Despite being the only clear champion of the Empire at this point Aëtius was slain by the Emperor Valentinian III's own hand, leading Sidonius Apollinaris to observe, [...] "I am ignorant, sir, of your motives or provocations; I only {{know that you have}} acted <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> has cut off his right hand with his left".|$|E

500|$|The score {{remained}} 1–0 at half-time, {{and it was}} {{the same}} story in the second half: England missed a multitude of easy chances, hit the woodwork numerous times and had one effort that appeared to cross the line not given. The England captain Billy Wright recalled that [...] "even Alf Ramsey, who used to be expressionless throughout a game, threw up his arms and looked to the sky when a perfect free-kick was somehow saved by their unorthodox keeper". No England goal came—the United States won 1–0 in what entered English football history as the national team's most embarrassing upset. Ramsey, who was fiercely patriotic, took the result as an acute personal humiliation. One journalist recalled that on hearing the match mentioned years later, [...] "his face creased and he looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had been jabbed in an unhealed wound". England could remain in the competition if they beat Spain in their last group game, but a 1–0 defeat saw them crash out.|$|E
500|$|Flynn {{is often}} {{regarded}} as one of Disney's most attractive heroes. In 2012, Vanity Fair conducted a poll for which readers were asked to vote for the sexiest Disney hero of all-time. Pairing Flynn against Prince Eric from The Little Mermaid, Flynn beat his competition by less than one percent, garnering 50.35 percent of the total votes. E! ranked the character third in its article [...] "The Definitive Ranking of Disney Princes Based on Overall Dating Eligibility". Writing for Seventeen, YouTube personality Tyler Oakley ranked Flynn the sixth most [...] "dateable" [...] Disney prince.

500|$|Carey {{recorded}} {{an official}} remix version for [...] "We Belong Together", which she produced with DJ Clue. The remix features vocals from rappers Jadakiss and Styles P, {{two-thirds of the}} hip-hop trio the LOX. The remix is fundamentally different from the original, described as having [...] "a faster, springier backbeat" [...] by Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times. Lyrically, the song {{is similar to the}} album version of the song, in which both rappers' verses contemplate on past memories. Styles P raps [...] "Past is the past, just let it be bygones / Matter of fact I know a fly song that we could vibe on", which Sanneh writes [...] "Cheerfully out of place, he sounds <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> has wandered into the wrong summertime party, but so what? He figures he might as well stick around and enjoy it." [...] In two separate reviews of The Emancipation of Mimi, Sanneh referred to the song as both [...] "great" [...] and [...] "excellent", in regards to the remix.|$|E

2500|$|Organized labor found J. J. McNamara an {{attractive}} figure to rally behind. By outward appearances, {{he did not}} look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> would dynamite his enemies. He was 34 years old, handsome, had an athletic build, always well-dressed and well-spoken. He had earned a law degree at night while working for the Iron Workers’ Union. J. J. McNamara assured Gompers that {{he had nothing to do}} with the Times bombing. Gompers believed him completely, and threw all his influence behind the McNamaras. With Gompers' endorsement, the entire US labor movement supported the McNamaras, with parades, mass rallies, publicity campaigns, and donations to the McNamaras' defense fund.|$|E

2500|$|In August 2005, after Alan Greenspan {{expressed}} concern over housing markets, Krugman criticized Greenspan's earlier reluctance {{to regulate the}} mortgage and related financial markets, arguing that [...] " [...] <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> suggests leaving the barn door ajar, and then – after the horse is gone – delivers a lecture {{on the importance of}} keeping your animals properly locked up." [...] Krugman has repeatedly expressed his view that Greenspan and Phil Gramm are the two individuals most responsible for causing the subprime crisis. Krugman points to Greenspan and Gramm for the key roles they played in keeping derivatives, financial markets, and investment banks unregulated, and to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which repealed Great Depression era safeguards that prevented commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies from merging.|$|E
2500|$|The lyrics {{focus on}} the men in Dixon's past {{relationships}} and their lazy attitudes. The chorus states her frustration with men not completing everyday housekeeping tasks; [...] "Does he wash up? Never wash up/Does he clean up? No he never cleans up/Does he brush up? He never brushed up". In the final verse the lyrics state, [...] "And if the man can't dance/He gets no second chance"; a reference to her refusal to date men if they cannot dance. In an interview Dixon explained in further detail about the lyric, saying [...] "I have to be honest, I do <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> can dance, but it's not a deal-breaker. It's nice if they can dance, but if they can't we'll just {{have to work on}} other areas!" ...|$|E

On its legal staff were Lee Pressman, Alger Hiss and John Abt (later named by Elizabeth Bentley as one of her contacts). There was Charles Krivitsky, a former physicist at New York University, then or shortly after to be known as Charles Kramer (also, later on, one of Elizabeth Bentley's contacts).

2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1915, it {{was clear}} that {{conscription}} was essential and Asquith laid the Military Service Act in the House of Commons on 5 January 1916. The Act introduced conscription of bachelors, and was extended to married men later in the year. Asquith's main opposition came from within his own party, particularly from Sir John Simon, who resigned. Asquith described Simon's stance in a letter to Sylvia Henley; [...] "I felt really <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had been struck publicly in the face by his son." [...] Some years later, Simon acknowledged his error; [...] "I have long since realised that my opposition was a mistake." [...] Asquith's achievement in bringing the bill through without breaking up the government was considerable, his wife writing; [...] "Henry's patience and skill in keeping Labour in this amazing change in England have stunned everyone," [...] but the long struggle [...] "hurt his own reputation and the unity of his party".|$|E

Let us compare the special ends, the means, the ordered relations of every kind, then let us listen to the inner voice of feeling; what healthy mind can reject its evidence? Unless the eyes are blinded by prejudices, can they fail to see that the visible order of the universe proclaims a supreme intelligence? What sophisms must be brought together before we fail to understand the harmony of existence and the wonderful co-operation of every part for the maintenance of the rest? ...|$|E
