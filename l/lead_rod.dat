500|$|Game four {{was played}} in Vancouver. Team Canada was {{surprised}} to find that the crowd booed Canada during the warm-up and cheered louder for the Soviets during the game's introduction. The game started with two consecutive penalties by Bill Goldsworthy and Boris Mikhailov scored power play goals on both penalties to give the Soviets a 2–0 lead. Goldsworthy, who had started in place of Wayne Cashman, wanted to replace Cashman's truculence, but only hurt his team and was criticized privately by Sinden. In the second, Gilbert Perreault scored on a Soviet own-goal to get Canada within one goal, but Blinov scored less than a minute later to restore the two-goal <b>lead.</b> <b>Rod</b> Gilbert scored a questionable goal that was disallowed and Canada's protests went unheeded. To Sinden, that was the turning point of the game, and the result could have been different had the goal been allowed, although Sinden admitted that it was [...] "a beating." [...] Vikulov scored to put the Soviets ahead 4–1 after two periods. In the third, Goldsworthy made partial amends to get Canada to 4–2, but Shadrin scored to put the game out of reach. Dennis Hull scored in the final minute to make it closer, but it was too late.|$|E

5000|$|A sap is a flat-profiled, leather-covered <b>lead</b> <b>rod,</b> {{fitted with}} a spring handle. It is also the name for a weapon of similar design (also called a slapper, slap jack or beavertail sap). A sap has a flat profile {{as opposed to a}} {{cylindrical}} profile of a blackjack, and spreads its impact out over a broader area, making it less likely to break bone. There is also a version called [...] "soft sap" [...] which is a stitched leather [...] "pouch" [...] filled tight with lead shot with a flat profile similar to a normal sap. The slight spring of the leather handle gives snap to the strike, but the lead shot is more forgiving than a solid piece of lead. It was primarily used for head strikes, intended to stun an opponent or render them unconscious.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Power Burst Facility Loss of Fluid Test (PBF LOFT) <b>Lead</b> <b>Rod</b> (LLR) Test program was to provide {{experimental}} data to characterize the mechanical behavior of LOFT type nuclear fuel rods under {{loss of coolant accident}} (LOCA) conditions, simulating the test conditions expected for the LOFT Power Ascension (L 2) Test series. Although the LLR tests were not explicitly designed to evaluate cladding surface thermocouple perturbation effects, comparison of the Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT) data for rods instrumented with and without cladding thermocouples provided pertinent information concerning the effects of cladding thermocouples on the time to DNB and time to quench data. Documentation and review of this data is presented in the following report. It will be shown that most of the LLR data indicate that the cladding surface thermocouples did not enhance the rewetting characteristics of the rods they are attached to, even though other evidence shows that the surface clad thermocouples did quench early. Finally, in order to accurately interpret and understand the limitations of the LVDT instrumentation, upon which thermocouple perturbation effects were evaluated, an analysis of the LVDT data as well as a review of the atypical response events that occurred during the LLR tests are presented in appendices to this document...|$|E
40|$|AmerGen Energy Company, LLC (AmerGen) {{plans to}} {{irradiate}} four M 5 clad fuel rods to end-of life rod average burnups ranging from about 63 to 69 GWd/mtU. Irradiation of these fuel rods will provide data on fuel and material performance that will support industry goals of extending the current fuel bumup limits, and will provide data to address Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) {{questions related to}} fuel performance behavior at high burnups. These fuel rods are currently in their third cycle of irradiation (TMI Unit 1 Operating Cycle 13), and will have cumulative rod average burnups ranging from approximately 42 to 48 GWd/mtU. The fuel rods will replace some of the original fuel rods in a twice-burned fuel assembly, which will then be irradiated for one additional cycle in TMI Unit 1. As detailed in Attachment 1, {{the use of these}} fuel rods will be fully evaluated as part of the TMI Unit 1 normal reload design process to ensure that all design criteria will be satisfied. Although the proposed irradiation of this limited number of fuel rods to high burnup does not require any Technical Specification changes, a specific safety evaluation will be performed for the condition consistent with the existing core reload program to ensure that no unreviewed safety question exists as defined by 10 CFR 50. 59. U 0 o 5928 - 00 - 20394 Page 2 A licensing basis commitment on rod burnup limits affects the implementation of this proposed program in that the four fuel rods will operate to burnup levels in excess of the <b>lead</b> <b>rod</b> burnup limit currently identified for Framatome Cogema Fuels (FCF) Mark-B fuel.

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{requirements and}} objectives for the reactivity initiated accident (RIA) tests {{to be conducted}} in the Power Burst Facility (PBF) are described 1 n the RIA Experiment Requirements Document (ERD) The primary objectives of the RIA research are to determine fuel failure thresholds, modes and consequences as functions of enthalpy insertion, irradiation history, and fuel design. Coolant conditions of pressure, temperature, and flow rate that are typical of hot-startup conditions in commercial BWRs {{will be used in}} the Series 1 tests. The first R!A test outlined in the ERD, RIA 1 - 1, is to be performed using four test fuel rods (two unirradiated and two irradiated) in the four rod hardware. The test fuel rods are to be exposed to a power transient in PBF which deposits an anergy of about 300 cal/g at 90 % of the fuel radius (i. e. near the fuel surface). This will be the first RIA experiment ever perfonned at hot startup conditions and three potential problems have been identified since the ERD was written. These problem areas are: identification of the fuel failure threshold energy deposition for hot-startup conditions, evaluation of calorimetry techniques for RIA transient tests, and determination of possible pressure pulses that can result from fuel failure in a water filled system. Also, recent TREAT test results have indicated that {{it may be difficult to}} obtain usable information from some of the instruments planned for use on the Ser 1 es 1 tests. To resolve the questions raised by the TREAT tests it will be necessary to expose selected instruments to a power burst and monitor their response under adiabatic, constant pressure conditions. Consideration of these potential problems made it clear that an RIA Scoping Test, the subject of this Experiment Specification Document, must be perforrned to resolve thest: potential problems prior to perfonnance of test RIA 1 - 1. The RIA Scop 1 ng Test should be comprised of five single rod experiments. The first rod will be subjected to a series of transient power bursts of ever increasing energy reIease to determine the energy deposition failure threshold. The second rod will be subjected to an energy deposition about 50 cal/g less than the energy deposition required for failure during the first test. The third rod will be tested at the failure threshold energy deposition. A calorimetric·power calibration will be performed on the second and third rods for comparison purposes. Rods four and five will be subjected to very high energy depositions (475 and 600 cal/g average energy insertion, respectively) to evaluate pressure pulse generation due to fuel fragmentation at hot-startup conditions. Calorimetric power calibrations will be performed on rods four and five. In the event of unexpectedly large pressure pulse generation for rods four and five it may be necessary to perform additional high energy deposition tests to determine the energy deposition required for fuel dispersal and subsequent pressure pulse generation. The PBF-TFBF singla rod test train or its equivalent will be used for the scoping tests. lnstrumentation for measurement of pressure pulse generation and test rod power will be necessary for the test. To evaluate the effects of radiation on the performance of the fuel rod instrumentation planned for the RlA Series 1 tests, two pressure sensors and an LVDT should be placed in a nearly adiabatic, constant pressure envirorment within the test train and monitored during the bursts. No test rod instrumentation will be required. Results of the <b>Lead</b> <b>Rod</b> Test Series will be used to make preliminary estimates of the transient burst period required...|$|E
