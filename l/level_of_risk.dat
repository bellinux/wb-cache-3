40|$|Abstract Background Coal workers' {{pneumoconiosis}} (CWP) is a preventable, but {{not fully}} curable occupational lung disease. More and more coal miners {{are likely to}} be at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> developing CWP owing to an increase in coal production and utilization, especially in developing countries. Coal miners with different occupational categories and durations of dust exposure may be at different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> for CWP. It is necessary to identify and classify different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> for CWP in coal miners with different work histories. In this way, we can recommend different intervals for medical examinations according to different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> for CWP. Our findings may provide a basis for further emending the measures of CWP prevention and control. Methods The study was performed using longitudinal retrospective data in the Tiefa Colliery in China. A three-layer artificial neural network with 6 input variables, 15 neurons in the hidden layer, and 1 output neuron was developed in conjunction with coal miners' occupational exposure data. Sensitivity and ROC analyses were adapted to explain the importance of input variables and the performance of the neural network. The occupational characteristics and the probability values predicted were used to categorize coal miners for their <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> for CWP. Results The sensitivity analysis showed that influence of the duration of dust exposure and occupational category on CWP was 65 % and 67 %, respectively. The area under the ROC in 3 sets was 0. 981, 0. 969, and 0. 992. There were 7959 coal miners with a probability value Conclusion The duration of dust exposure and occupational category were the two most important factors for CWP. Coal miners at different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> for CWP could be classified by the three-layer neural network analysis based on occupational history. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{restriction}} on portfolio size results in welfare losses for investors. To measure these welfare losses, we compare n-asset optimal portfolios with 26 -asset optimal portfolios using {{the concept of}} proportionate opportunity cost. The original historical asset returns data are used with a VAR in generating joint returns distributions for the portfolio formation period. We find that suboptimal diversification imposes substantial costs on investors with low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> relative <b>risk</b> aversion. Investors with high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> aversion incur very small or no cost at all diversifying sub-optimally. We show that investors with high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> aversion place most of their initial wealth in the safe asset and, therefore, few stocks are needed to achieve optimal diversification.
