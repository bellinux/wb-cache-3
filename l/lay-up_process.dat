40|$|ABSTRACTGlass Fiber Reinforced Plastic (GFRP) {{structures}} are primarily manufactured using hand lay-up or vacuum infusion techniques, which are cost-effective {{for the construction}} of marine vessels. This paper aims to investigate the mechanical properties and failure mechanisms of the hybrid GFRP composites, formed by applying the hand <b>lay-up</b> <b>processed</b> exterior and the vacuum infusion processed interior layups, providing benefits for structural performance and ease of manufacturing. The hybrid GFRP composites contain one, two, and three vacuum infusion processed layer sets with consistent sets of hand <b>lay-up</b> <b>processed</b> layers. Mechanical properties assessed in this study include tensile, compressive and in-plane shear properties. Hybrid composites with three sets of vacuum infusion layers showed the highest tensile mechanical properties while those with two sets had the highest mechanical properties in compression.

40|$|A {{recently}} developed peel test designed {{to simulate the}} automated tape <b>lay-up</b> (ATL) <b>process</b> {{was used to measure}} tack and dynamic stiffness of newly developed ATL prepregs. Resin was extracted from the prepreg process before impregnation of the fibres. Isothermal small amplitude frequency sweeps were carried out in shear rheology to determine time–temperature superposition parameters in the form of Williams–Landel–Ferry equation. Gel permeation chromatography and differential scanning calorimetry demonstrated that the resin was not significantly changed during the prepregging process. The WLF parameters were used to transpose isothermal tack and dynamic stiffness results with excellent agreement found. This relationship offers manufacturers using composite prepreg a method to maximise and maintain tack levels at different feed rates by appropriate changes in temperature. This is of significant importance in improving the reliability of automated composite <b>lay-up</b> <b>processes</b> such as AFP and ATL, whose feed rate must vary to accommodate lay-up operations...|$|R

IiiTRODUCTIOS OMPOSITE hZATERIALS HAVE attracted considerable attention in the marine C industry. Traditionally, the field is dominated by short-fiber systems com-posed of glass fibers in a polyester matrix. However, in applications where fuel consumption and/or high performance are important, cored continuous fiber composite materials have recently been introduced. For example, state-of-the-art power yachts employ continuous glass fiber/polyester laniinates tacuum-bagged to an end-grain balsa wood or PVC core [l]. Highly advanced racing boats employ carbodepoxy laminates in the hull skins over low-density PVC foam or Nomex honeycomb core to reduce weight [2].

Automated manufacturing technologies promise not only reduced production costs but also higher quality, repeatable parts. The introduction of existing automated manufacturing techniques and technologies from industries such as the automotive sector into aerospace can be challenging due to the unique product characteristics as well as the stringent certification and quality control requirements of the industry. The aerospace industry is a low-volume, high value production environment where "hand-made" products are produced by highly experienced and qualified trades-people. Both metallic and composite components are subjected to precise manufacturing control and documentation requirements. The introduction of automated manufacturing technologies must be done {{in such a way as}} to respect these often demanding constraints. The introduction of automation to industrialized processes impacts not only the way parts are produced, but also the way they are designed. Successful composite design and manufacturing automation in the aerospace industry requires the engineering designer and analyst to become increasingly involved in the manufacturing of the product, as machine limitations and producibility become increasingly important drivers for design. This paper presents an overview of a development project intended to evaluate the effectiveness and benefits of the automated fibre placement technology through the design, prototype build and testing of a composite tailboom. The discussion centres on the "design for manufacturing" concept and provides a perspective on the project objectives, material and process selection and trade-offs, geometric and structural considerations, and component assembly and fastening.

It is also inevitable to have considerable variations in the strength of concrete. Therefore, the behaviour of FRP bonded concrete members varies among specimens even when the same materials are used. The variation of localized FRP stiffness and concrete strength can be combined in a single parameter as variation of the localized interfacial fracture energy. In an effort to effectively model the effects of the variation of interfacial fracture energy on the load versus deflection responses of FRP bonded concrete specimens subjected to Mode I and Mode II loading, a random white noise using a one-dimensional standard Brownian motion is added to the governing equations, yielding stochastic differential equations.

High quality carbon fiber-reinforced nanocomposites were manufactured through <b>lay-up</b> plus autoclave <b>process.</b> The nanocomposites had uniform fiber volume fraction, fewer dry spots, and fewer resin-rich areas.

The interlaminar fracture toughness of carbon fiber-reinforced composites was evidently increased with the introduction of nanoclay. The fracture surface of nanoclay-filled samples exhibited relatively rougher feature, compared to the featureless fracture surface of pristine epoxy system.

40|$|The {{effect of}} epoxy-size {{and degree of}} cure on the {{interfacial}} bonding of an epoxy-amine-graphite fiber composite system is examined. The role of the fiber-resin interface in determining the overall mechanical properties of composites is poorly understood.

The incompatibility of these two processes makes it important to understand the nature and basic factors involved at the fiber-resin interface as stress is applied. The mechanical properties including interlaminar shear values for graphite fiber-resin composites are low compared to glass and boron-resin composites.

40|$|In {{the rapidly}} growing {{large-scale}} composites industry, specifically {{in the area of}} wind turbine blade manufacturing, reducing costs through reduced man-hours and materials while simultaneously increasing quality has become a major focus. One strategy is to automate the manual <b>lay-up</b> <b>process.</b> Automation techniques used in the aerospace industry are too costly for wind turbine blade manufacturing; therefore, new techniques need to be investigated. This research describes a new fabric pre-shearing process to reduce out-of-plane deformations during the <b>lay-up</b> <b>process</b> that enables automated deposition of unidirectional non-crimp fabrics (NCF) in molds. This new process controls the manipulation of broad-loom NCF fabrics such that fabric geometry is well controlled, reducing the need for naïve and inconsistent manual lay-ups.

The goal of this research was {{to determine the effects of}} shearing process parameters on NCF fabric geometry and validate the predicted characteristics generated by the previous shearing model. An empirical study of fabric shearing was conducted and the analysis of fabric samples transformed by the pre-shearing process is presented.

50|$|The {{processing}} {{steps are}} very similar to those in hand <b>lay-up.</b> In this <b>process,</b> the release agent is first applied to the mould and then a layer of gelcoat is applied. The gelcoat is left for two hours, until it hardens. Once the gelcoat hardens, a spray gun is used to deposit the fibre resin mixture onto the surface of the mould. The spray gun chops the incoming continuous rovings (one or more rovings) to a predetermined length and impels it through the resin/catalyst mixture. Resin/catalyst mixing can take place inside the gun (gun mixing) or {{just in front of the}} gun. Gun mixing provides thorough mixing of resin and catalyst inside the gun and is preferred to minimize the health hazard concerns of the operator. In the other type, the catalyst is sprayed through two side nozzles into the resin envelope. Airless spray guns are becoming popular because they provide more controlled spray patterns and reduced emission of volatiles. In an airless system, hydraulic pressure is used to dispense the resin through special nozzles that break up the resin stream into small droplets which then become saturated with the reinforcements. In an air-atomized spray gun system, pressurized air is used to dispense the resin.|$|R

Test data {{can be found in}} the SNL/MSU/DOE Fatigue of Composite Materials Database which is updated annually. This is the fifth report in this series, which summarizes progress of the overall program since its inception in 1989. The primary thrust of this program has been research and testing of a broad range of structural laminate materials of interest to blade structures. The report is focused on current types of infused and prepreg blade materials, either processed in-house or by industry partners. Trends in static and fatigue performance are analyzed for a range of materials, geometries and loading conditions. Materials include: sixteen resins of three general types, five epoxy based paste adhesives, fifteen reinforcing fabrics including three fiber types, three prepregs, many laminate <b>lay-ups</b> and <b>process</b> variations. Significant differences in static and fatigue performance and delamination resistance are quantified for particular materials and process conditions. When blades do fail, the likely cause is fatigue in the structural detail areas or at major flaws. The program is focused strongly on these issues in addition to standard laminates. Structural detail tests allow evaluation of various blade materials options in the context of more realistic representations of blade structure than do the standard test methods. Types of structural details addressed in this report include ply drops used in thickness tapering, and adhesive joints, each tested over a range of fatigue loading conditions. Ply drop studies were in two areas: (1) a combined experimental and finite element study of basic ply drop delamination parameters for glass and carbon prepreg laminates, and (2) the development of a complex structured resin-infused coupon including ply drops, for comparison studies of various resins, fabrics and pry drop thicknesses. Adhesive joint tests using typical blade adhesives included both generic testing of materials parameters using a notched-lap-shear test geometry developed in this study, and also a series of simulated blade web joint geometries fabricated by an industry partner...|$|R

Among other materials, FMLs represent a clear example of damage tolerant hybrid materials, made by bonding thin metal sheets together with fibres embedded in epoxy.

In this light, the present dissertation describes the investigation on the residual strength failure sequence in FMLs, and presents the development of an accurate analytical prediction method. The failure sequence is studied in particular for standard Glare laminates, which are relevant laminates for applications in aircraft pressurized fuselages. The developed analytical method has been implemented into two numerical models, considering both through-the-thickness crack and fatigue crack configurations. The developed models are validated against a large number of experimental data, which are also presented in this thesis. The main concept in this dissertation is that the crack growth process in the metallic layers of an FML can be described with the Crack Tip Opening Angle concept (CTOA). This approach includes the contribution of the fibre layers (e. g. fibre failure and fibre bridging) and the associated quasi-static delamination growth. An introduction to FMLs and to all various Glare grades, <b>lay-ups,</b> and manufacturing <b>processes</b> is provided in chapter 2. Some current and future applications for aircraft structures are also discussed in that chapter. A qualitative description of the principal failure mechanisms occurring during the residual strength failure sequence is presented in chapter 3. Based on experimental observations, the metal crack growth mechanisms, permanent plastic deformation, fibre failure and static delamination growth are discussed. All these mechanisms are related to each other, and all contribute to the residual strength of the laminate. The development of the prediction models aimed to be a step forward with respect to previous relevant prediction models available in literature. Therefore, both empirical and analytical prediction models available in literature are presented and discussed in chapter 4. A critical evaluation of those models has pointed out their limitations in applicability and versatility towards a “generic FML” concept. From this chapter, some guidelines have been defined to address the subsequent model development. Two types of experimental activities were carried out. The first type consisted in experiments to gain understanding of the deformation behaviour of both metallic and fibre layers. Extensive use of Digital Image Correlation technique enabled to observe and measure the deformation field of both metal and fibre layers, and their interaction. Further insight into the fibre bridging mechanism and into the metal-fibre interaction was obtained. These experimental activities are discussed in chapter 5. The second type of experimental activities aimed to generate input data for the prediction model, and to validate the CTOA approach. These are discussed in chapter 6. A large amount of experimental CTOA tests were conducted on several FML grades to evaluate the CTOA as failure criterion for FML. This included the investigation of the effect of metal sheet thickness, crack length-to-panel width ratio and the effect of bridging fibres. Static delamination growth tests were conducted to obtain the critical Strain Energy Release Rate. This parameter was subsequently used as input in the prediction model to define the critical condition for the delamination growth. Furthermore, in the same chapter, it is also discussed the complex interaction between static delamination growth and plastic deformation of the metallic layers. The core aspect of the present thesis concerns the modelling of the residual strength failure sequence, which is presented in chapter 7. Two models are described: one for the through-the-thickness crack and one for the fatigue crack. Both models are based on the same method, which uses the CTOA as crack growth driving parameter. The method is {{based on the idea that}} crack extension in the metallic layers occurs when the calculated CTOA reaches the critical value obtained from CTOA experiments on metal laminates containing the same metal layers used in the FML. The calculated CTOA is a function of the contribution due to the far-field stress in the aluminium layers, and the contribution of the fibres. The fibre can contribute either in terms of crack opening contribution (broken fibres) or crack closing contribution (bridging fibres present in the fatigue crack configuration). Plastic deformation ahead and behind the metal crack tip is accounted and implemented into the calculation. In addition, in the case of fatigue crack configurations, the bridging stress is calculated by solving the deformation compatibility equation, accounting for the plastic zone ahead of the crack tip and fibre failure in the bridging area. The bridging stress is subsequently used to calculate the quasi-static delamination growth occurring at the fibre-metal interface using the Strain Energy Release Rate approach. The model for through-the-thickness crack showed a very good agreement with the experimental data, while the model for fatigue crack configuration showed sufficient agreement with experimental data. The modelling of the fatigue crack configuration presents higher degree of complexity, which required a number of simplifications and assumptions, making the model less robust than the one for through-the-thickness crack. Chapter 8 summarises the conclusions of the investigations. It can be concluded that with the proposed models, the mechanisms related to the residual strength failure sequence are fully described and characterized. The model for through-the-thickness crack is robust and validated, and can be extended to other material and geometrical configurations. The model for fatigue crack is not robust enough, but further improvements are possible. Mechanics, Aerospace Structures & MaterialsAerospace Engineerin...|$|R
