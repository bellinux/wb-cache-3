25|$|As {{there is}} no {{chainwheel}} on a unicycle, both right and left cranks are identical, except for the pedal attachment thread in the <b>left-hand</b> <b>crank,</b> which is reverse threaded.|$|E
50|$|Bicycle pedals are left-threaded on the <b>left-hand</b> <b>crank</b> so that {{precession}} tightens {{the pedal}} rather than loosening it. This may seem counter-intuitive, but the torque exerted {{due to the}} precession is several orders of magnitude greater than that caused by a jammed pedal bearing.|$|E
5000|$|In March 1973 {{a team of}} Matra {{engineers}} led by Georges Pinardaud {{completed the}} initial design for project M560, {{which was to be}} a more powerful Bagheera. A key part of the project was the creation of a unique [...] "U engine" [...] out of two existing Simca straight-4 engines. The blocks came from two different Simca applications and rotated in opposite directions but shared the same 1294 cc displacement. One block was from the 1100Ti and was adapted to transverse mounting while the other was from the Simca 1000 Rallye II in which it had been mounted longitudinally. The two blocks were joined at an 82Â° angle using a common cast-aluminum sump that also carried a common oil supply for the engine. At the non-drive end another aluminum casting assured the alignment of the blocks while at the drive end a steel adapter fit the ends of both crankshafts. A sprocket and Morse chain from each crankshaft were connected to a 0.9 in shaft running {{down the middle of the}} sump that transmitted power from the <b>left-hand</b> <b>crank</b> to the right. Each block retained its own crankshaft, distributor, and water pump. The clutch and bell-housing of the engine from the Rallye II engine provided the transaxle mounting while a flywheel was only mounted to the 1100Ti crankshaft. The resulting [...] 8-cylinder assembly was fitted with four Weber 36 DCNF carburetors and, with a 9.8:1 compression ratio, produced [...] @ 6200 rpm and 216 Nm @ 4000 rpm.|$|E
50|$|The special pedal cranks allowed both pedals to {{be rotated}} forward so that the pedals would form motorcycle-style {{footrests}} in normal operation. To engage the pedals, the <b>left-hand</b> pedal <b>crank</b> could be rotated forward and locked and a drive gear engaged allowing the user to pedal. A short chain connected the pedal drive to the main engine-chain drive system. Pedalling was hard work for the rider: there was no freewheel and the pedal gearing was very low. The engine could be started with pedal drive engaged, causing the pedals to rotate under engine power when the bike was in gear. In practice, the cam and shaft arrangement to engage the pedals frequently seized (in normal operation, a rider would very rarely engage pedal-drive as it was less tiring to push than to pedal).|$|R
