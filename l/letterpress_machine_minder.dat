50|$|Rotary <b>letterpress</b> <b>machines</b> {{are still}} {{used on a}} wide scale for {{printing}} self-adhesive and non-self-adhesive labels, tube laminate, cup stock, etc. The printing quality achieved by a modern <b>letterpress</b> <b>machine</b> with UV curing is on par with flexo presses. It is more convenient and user friendly than a flexo press. It uses water-wash photopolymer plates, which {{are as good as}} any solvent-washed flexo plate. Today even CtP (computer-to-plate) plates are available making it a full-fledged, modern printing process. Because there is no anilox roller in the process, the make-ready time also goes down when compared to a flexo press. Inking is controlled by keys very much similar to an offset press. UV inks for letterpress are in paste form, unlike flexo. Various manufacturers produce UV rotary <b>letterpress</b> <b>machines,</b> viz. Dashen, Nickel, Taiyo Kikai, KoPack, Gallus, etc. - and offer hot/cold foil stamping, rotary die cutting, flatbed die cutting, sheeting, rotary screen printing, adhesive side printing, and inkjet numbering. Central impression presses are more popular than inline presses due to their ease of registration and simple design. Printing of up to nine colours plus varnish is possible with various online converting processes.|$|R
50|$|Letterpress is {{a method}} of {{printing}} many identical copies that requires characters being impressed upon the page. The print may be inked or blind but is typically done in a single color. Motifs or designs may be added as many <b>letterpress</b> <b>machines</b> use movable plates that must be hand-set.|$|R

50|$|Small presses became {{distinguishable}} from jobbing printers at {{some time}} {{towards the end of}} the nineteenth century. The roots lie with the Arts and Crafts Movement, particularly the Kelmscott Press. The use of small <b>letterpress</b> <b>machines</b> by amateur printers increased proportionately to the mechanization of commercial printing. Later, the advance of practical lithography made small press publication much easier.|$|R
50|$|Hans Heinrich Baumgarten (1806-1875) {{was from}} the town of Halstenbek near Pinneberg, in Schleswig-Holstein, an area of Germany that was then part of Denmark. He was apprenticed as a coffin maker by a farmer whose {{livestock}} he cared for. Later he was a carpenter before becoming a <b>machine</b> <b>minder</b> at the Danish newspaper Berlingske Tidende, whose printing office he later worked for in Berlin.|$|R
40|$|A nested {{case-control study}} {{of lung cancer}} among men exposed to ink mist in {{newspaper}} production with rotary letterpress technology is presented. It is based within a historical cohort of 9232 printing workers in Manchester (1949 - 63). Men who operated newspaper rotary <b>letterpress</b> <b>machines</b> had a lung cancer standardised mortality ratio (SMR) of 179 (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 144 - 218) when compared with rates for England and Wales for the follow up period 1950 - 83. When adjustment was made for the higher rates in the local area, the SMR was reduced to 122 (95 % CI 98 - 148). The nested case control study was based on 110 lung cancer cases (1949 - 86) and 316 matched controls. Duration of work in a rotary <b>letterpress</b> <b>machine</b> room was positively associated with risk of lung cancer (chi 2 linear trend = 3. 30, p = 0. 07); mean with 30 or more years duration of exposure had a risk of 1. 73 (95 % CI 0. 94 - 3. 17), relative to those with less than 20 years of exposure. Adjustment for period of first exposure in a machine room reduced {{the strength of the}} positive duration effect. The magnitude of the SMRs found in the cohort study could be explained by confounding with smoking. The duration effect seen in the case-control study, however, suggests {{that there may be a}} real effect of exposure to letterpress ink mists. This is biologically plausible, as benzo[a]pyrene, a known human carcinogen, has been found in appreciable concentrations in the atmosphere of rotary <b>letterpress</b> <b>machine</b> rooms...|$|R

50|$|In 1951, Thaunkanhe, {{the first}} Nepal Bhasa monthly {{magazine}} {{to be published}} from Nepal, began publication with Sagar as the deputy editor. In a bid to promote publishing in Nepal Bhasa, Sagar formed a partnership with two like-minded former Tibetan traders, Purna Kaji Tamrakar and Ratna Man Singh Tuladhar, and in 1952 established Nepal Press at his home at 11/122 Asan Tyouda Tol, Kathmandu. Their equipment consisted of second-hand Vicobold <b>letterpress</b> <b>machines</b> imported from Kolkata.|$|R

Life demands something more from us than acquiescence. And now in a roomful of <b>machine</b> <b>minders</b> he was to learn a wider lesson, to make the acquaintance of another factor in life, a factor as elemental as the loss of things dear to us, more elemental even than toil.|$|R

50|$|The first Polish stamp {{was issued}} for the Congress Kingdom on 1 January 1860 (Gregorian calendar). Because 1 January was a Sunday the stamp was not {{actually}} available {{until the following}} day. The design {{was similar to the}} contemporary Russian stamps with the arms of the Congress Kingdom in the centre. The engraving was done by the Polish Bank engraver Henryk Mejer. The drawings he used were found in the archives at St Petersburg but the name of the artist remains unknown. The stamps were printed by the government printers in Warsaw on the orders of the Congress Kingdom postal service. The <b>letterpress</b> <b>machine</b> used was invented by Izrael Abraham Staffel (1814-1884) for printing in two colours. The machine was capable of printing 1,000 sheets per hour and it had a counting device which ensured an accurate count. Apart from these facts very little more is known about the machine.|$|R
5000|$|The Autotron spurred spinoffs: the Secatron (1954) for carton {{makers to}} ensure their {{pictures}} were centred; the Webatron for bag making machines; the Trakatron (1953) for the special requirements of cellophane and paper printers, and the Inkatron (1960) for sheet-fed offset presses. At the request of Sun Printers, Crosfield developed the Idotron (1956) to control ink viscosity, later superseded by the Viscomex (1959). In 1953 the technical director of Axel Springer, Germany's largest newspaper publisher, asked Crosfield to design equipment that would allow Springer to first print coloured illustrations, including advertising, in rotogravure and then re-reel to print the text on web offset. This led to the Insetter (1958) that revolutionised newspaper printing by permitting the economical use of colour. The Synchroscope gave <b>machine</b> <b>minders</b> the capacity to visualise images as they were being printed. In the US, Gravure Research Inc. commissioned Crosfield to develop equipment to stop [...] "speckling", undesirable white flecks in shadow areas. In 1966 the Heliostat, which applied an electric charge of several thousand volts to attract ink to paper, appeared. By then Crosfield {{had the support of}} a team of talented researchers, installation engineers, a production facility and sales and administrative staff.|$|R

5|$|Gerard Anthony Francis Conroy {{was born}} in Dublin to John (Jack) and Esther Conroy, {{and was one of}} ten siblings: Alphonsus (Ollie), Laurence (Lar), John (Donny), Rita, Peter, Michael, Vincent, Paul, and Marie. Christened as Gerard, he soon became known by the name Terry as he could not {{pronounce}} 'Gerard' as a young child. His mother held two jobs: as a factory worker and an office cleaner. The family lived in the suburb of Cabra, and had very limited finances. Being one of the younger children he was indulged, and took advantage of his lack of household chores to spend the majority of his time playing football in the street. However he was arrested by a plain-clothed policeman and sentenced to probation in Children's Court for playing football in the street. He later credited his ball control skills to the many years he spent playing football with large numbers of other children in the tight streets of Cabra. His father and brothers were in the printing trade, and his brother Ollie, a talented footballer, rejected the opportunity to turn professional at Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1950 in order to remain employed in Dublin as a <b>machine</b> <b>minder</b> and play football part-time in the League of Ireland. Three more of his brothers also played in the League of Ireland, and both Ollie and Michael played in the Shelbourne team that won the FAI Cup in 1960.|$|R
50|$|On a sheet-fed <b>letterpress</b> {{printing}} <b>machine,</b> a frisket is a {{sheet of}} oiled paper that covers {{the space between the}} type or cuts (illustrations) and the edge of the paper that is to be printed. When the press operator uses a brayer to coat the surface of the type with ink, the ink brayer will often coat the furniture and slugs (wood and metal spacers) between the columns and around the type. To keep this ink from touching the target sheet, the frisket covers the area that is not desired to print. The frisket is set in a frame, often hinged to the tympan that holds the paper in place.|$|R

6000|$|There came also {{practical}} psychologists {{with some}} very interesting developments {{in the art of}} hypnotism. The names of Milne Bramwell, Fechner, Liebault, William James, Myers and Gurney, he found, bore a value now that would have astonished their contemporaries. Several practical applications of psychology were now in general use; it had largely superseded drugs, antiseptics and anesthetics in medicine; was employed by almost all who had any need of mental concentration. A real enlargement of human faculty seemed to have been effected in this direction. The feats of [...] "calculating boys," [...] the wonders, as Graham had been wont to regard them, of mesmerisers, were now within the range of anyone who could afford the services of a skilled hypnotist. Long ago the old examination methods in education had been destroyed by these expedients. Instead of years of study, candidates had substituted a few weeks of trances, and during the trances expert coaches had simply to repeat all the points necessary for adequate answering, adding a suggestion of the post-hypnotic recollection of these points. In process mathematics particularly, this aid had been of singular service, and it was now invariably invoked by such players of chess and games of manual dexterity as were still to be found. In fact, all operations conducted under finite rules, of a quasi-mechanical sort that is, were now systematically relieved from the wanderings of imagination and emotion, and brought to an unexampled pitch of accuracy. Little children of the labouring classes, so soon as they were of sufficient age to be hypnotised, were thus converted into beautifully punctual and trustworthy <b>machine</b> <b>minders,</b> and released forthwith from the long, long thoughts of youth. Aeronautical pupils, who gave way to giddiness, could be relieved from their imaginary terrors. In every street were hypnotists ready to print permanent memories upon the mind. If anyone desired to remember a name, a series of numbers, a song or a speech, it could be done by this method, and conversely memories could be effaced, habits removed, and desires eradicated--a sort of psychic surgery was, in fact, in general use. Indignities, humbling experiences, were thus forgotten, widows would obliterate their previous husbands, angry lovers release themselves from their slavery. To graft desires, however, was still impossible, and the facts of thought transference were yet unsystematised. The psychologists illustrated their expositions with some astounding experiments in mnemonics made through the agency of a troupe of pale-faced children in blue.|$|R
5000|$|Today, {{with the}} American {{newspaper}} USA Today as an inspiration, launched on Tuesday 4 March 1986, {{with the front}} page headline, [...] "Second Spy Inside GCHQ". At 18p, it was a middle-market tabloid, a rival to the long-established Daily Mail and Daily Express. It pioneered computer photo-typesetting and full-colour offset printing {{at a time when}} national newspapers were still using Linotype <b>machines,</b> <b>letterpress</b> and could only reproduce photographs in black and white. The colour was initially crude, produced on equipment which had no facility for colour proofing, so the first view of the colour was on the finished product. However, it forced the conversion of all UK national newspapers to electronic production and colour printing. The newspaper's motto, hung in the newsroom, was [...] "propa truth, not propaganda".|$|R
40|$|And per se and’, was an {{exhibition}} which explored {{the history and}} evolution of the ampersand, spanning almost 2, 000 years, exploring how well the ampersand has {{stood the test of}} time. The symbol has been pushed and pulled around artistically by typographers, calligraphers, designers and artists and is everywhere, from company logos to our computer or phone keyboards. It is also an important character in computer coding. Arguably the most expressive and versatile of symbols, the ampersand evolved from the Latin et, meaning and. The ampersand {{is one of the oldest}} alphabetic abbreviations. By its very nature, history and definition, it is inviting and inclusive. Its versatility is astonishing. Whatever the designing of a new font inflicts upon it, the ampersand holds its own. Still recognisable after flourishes are added, or elements of its anatomy pruned back. Looking at the ampersand within any font reveals so much about the character of the typeface. As well as taking the viewer through the intriguing life and times of the ampersand, the exhibition featured the work of many local and international artists and designers, who submitted pieces of artwork to celebrate the beauty and versatility of the ampersand. The work on show was wonderfully diverse, with pieces generated from a hand-built drawing <b>machine,</b> <b>letterpress</b> experimentations, calligraphic submissions, to name a few. ‘And per se and’ was open between Thursday, October 22, and November 12, 2015 at the University of Sunderland Design Centre Gallery, City Campus, Chester Road...|$|R
40|$|This {{book does}} not mention TEX on any of its two hundred pages. However, I think {{publication}} of the review {{in the pages of}} TUGboat is justified. The famous exhortation [2, p. 303] “Go forth now and create masterpieces of the publishing art ” {{is as much a part}} of The TEXbook as the explanation of or. Thus discussions about the art of the book are relevant for TUG publications, and we will continue reviewing books about publishing, typography and typesetting. This collection of essays by Jerry Kelly is a good example of them. Of course, the fact that the last chapter in the book is written about the Wizard of Fonts, permanent honorary board member of TUG, Hermann Zapf, only adds to the allure of this book for TEX users. The last century saw many quick changes in the technology of book making. At its beginning, most typographers used <b>letterpress.</b> Hot metal <b>machines,</b> phototypesetting, offset printing and other inventions came and went, to be supplanted today by digital typography. Book making was deeply influenced by these changes. The tumultuous history of society and art in 20 th century was another source of influence for the old art of typography. Thus writing about book making in this period is a very difficult — but a very interesting — task. Jerry Kelly approaches his subject with a biographical method. His book is a collection of short essays about the leading typographers of the las...|$|R
