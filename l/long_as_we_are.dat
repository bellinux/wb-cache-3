Instead of defining the threshold value, the study establishes a range, and the threshold is supposed to lie inside it. The lower end of that range {{is defined as the}} boundary. Therefore, it defines a safe space, in the sense that as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> below the boundary, we are below the threshold value. If the boundary is crossed, we enter into a danger zone.|$|E

Classical compatibilists have addressed the dilemma of free will by arguing that free will holds as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not externally constrained or coerced. Modern compatibilists {{make a distinction between}} freedom of will and freedom of action, that is, separating freedom of choice from the freedom to enact it. Given that humans all experience a sense of free will, some modern compatibilists think it is necessary to accommodate this intuition. Compatibilists often associate freedom of will with the ability to make rational decisions.|$|E
500|$|On 10 October, the IRA bombed London's Chelsea Barracks, killing 2 and {{injuring}} 40. Denouncing the attack, Livingstone informed {{members of the}} Cambridge University Tory Reform Group {{that it was a}} misunderstanding to view the IRA as [...] "criminals or lunatics" [...] because of their strong political motives and that [...] "violence will recur again and again as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> in Ireland." [...] Mainstream press criticised him for these comments, with The Sun labeling him [...] "the most odious man in Britain". In response, Livingstone proclaimed that the press coverage had been [...] "ill-founded, utterly out of context and distorted", reiterating his opposition both to IRA attacks and British rule in Northern Ireland. Anti-Livingstone pressure mounted and on 15 October he was publicly attacked in the street by members of unionist militia, The Friends of Ulster. In a second incident, Livingstone was attacked by far right skinheads shouting [...] "commie bastard" [...] at the Three Horseshoes Pub in Hampstead. Known as [...] "Green Ken" [...] among Ulster Unionists, Unionist paramilitary Michael Stone of the Ulster Defence Association [...] plotted to kill Livingstone, only abandoning the plan when he became convinced that the security services were onto him.|$|E

500|$|For {{his strong}} {{performance}} {{during the first}} half of the season, Hamels was, for the first time in his career, selected a member of the NL All Star Team. As Hamels had been the Phillies only consistent starter to that point, even to the point that one columnist said the Phillies are a joke [...] "as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> forced to look forward to someone other than Cole Hamels on the mound", the Phillies acquired Kyle Lohse to supplement the rotation soon before the trading deadline. Several weeks later, Hamels was placed on the 15-day disabled list (DL) with a mild left elbow strain. After the Phillies activated him from the DL, on September 28, he helped the Phillies take over first place in the National League East by striking out 13 Washington Nationals over 8 innings in a 6–0 win. Two days later, the team clinched a spot in the playoffs for the first time in 14 years. In the first game of the National League Division Series, he started for the Phillies, but surrendered three runs, three hits, and an [...] "uncharacteristic" [...] four walks, while striking out seven in 6 innings; he was assessed the loss. Ultimately, the Phillies lost the series. Hamels finished with a regular-season record of 15–5, a 3.39 ERA, and 177 strikeouts in 183 [...] innings. The Philadelphia chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America presented him the [...] "Steve Carlton Most Valuable Pitcher" [...] award.|$|E
500|$|In January 2016, Joss Whedon {{noted that}} this process [...] "unfortunately just means the TV show gets, you know, leftovers." [...] He stated that, for example, the series' {{creative}} team initially wanted to use Loki's scepter from The Avengers but were unable due to Whedon's plans for it in Age of Ultron. On how their ability {{to connect with the}} films changed {{over the life of the}} series, Jed Whedon said, [...] "The rule when we started was we couldn't say anything about spies, we couldn't say anything about Hydra, we couldn't have any A.I. or robots or anything like that, because all of that was coming in movies that year or the year after. Since then, they've blown those doors wide open." [...] He added, [...] "We have relatively free rein we just can't go anywhere that [...] going. They know their stories so much further out than we do, which is good for us to tee up things that we know are coming to them or avoid things that they want to be special on the big screen. As <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not covering bases that they're going to cover, we haven't been told [...] "no" [...] that much". As an example, Whedon noted the fourth season's Framework storyline as [...] "something that's pretty significant in our world, but is also a little eddy in the river that doesn't affect anything else because it's an alternate universe. So those kinds of stories help us go big without sending ripples through the whole MCU." ...|$|E

2500|$|Over {{that span}} of time, several other Jewish people sought refuge with the Macugowskis. Eventually, nine refugees, {{including}} {{a cousin of}} the Radzas, were packed inside. Much later, Burack's sister Miriam described their packed state to reporters: [...] "When one turned on his side, the others {{would have to do}} the same. We were like sardines." [...] The Macugowskis would come down at night to bring bread, water, and a bucket for waste. The Radzas, despairing their situation, sometimes begged them for poisoned food or a gun to end their misery, but the Macugowskis refused. Burack later recalled that they insisted, [...] "As <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> alive, we will save you.

2500|$|The pro-"Continental Bloc" [...] Germans in Ribbentrop's entourage {{expected}} that Stalin would eventually yield given {{the weakness of}} the Red Army.

[...] On November 14 Köstring reiterated his conviction that the Soviet Union had no aggressive designs indeed, just the contrary: [...] "Molotov's trip (to Berlin) is for me just further proof of an idea that I have long held namely, that the Soviet Union wants to have peace with us, since it cannot expect any advantage from a conflict with us [...] [...] [...] [...] The decisive factor in [...] the Soviet desire for peace is and remains the demonstrated strength of our army." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though the Round Table {{itself is}} not {{mentioned}} until Wace, the concept of Arthur having a marvelous court made up of many prominent warriors is much older. Geoffrey of Monmouth says that after establishing peace throughout Britain, Arthur [...] "increased his personal entourage by inviting very distinguished men from far-distant kingdoms to join it." [...] The code of chivalry so important in later romance figures in as well, as Geoffrey says Arthur established [...] "such a code of courtliness in his household that he inspired peoples living far away to imitate him." [...] Long before Geoffrey, Arthur's court was well known to Welsh storytellers; in the romance Culhwch and Olwen, written around 1100, the protagonist Culhwch invokes the names of 225 individuals affiliated with Arthur. In fact, the fame of Arthur's entourage became so prominent in Welsh tradition that in the later additions to the Welsh Triads, the formula tying named individuals to [...] "Arthur's Court" [...] in the triad titles began to supersede the older [...] "Island of Britain" [...] formula. Though the code of chivalry crucial to later continental romances dealing with the Round Table is mostly absent from the earlier Welsh material, some passages of Culhwch and Olwen seem to prefigure it, for instance when Arthur explains the ethos of his court, saying [...] "e are nobles as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> sought out: the greater the bounty we may give, the greater our nobility, fame and honour." ...|$|E
