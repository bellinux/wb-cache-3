30|$|A {{previous}} study at our institution looked at giant cell tumor defects in distal femurs reconstructed {{with three different}} techniques—intramedullary Steinmann pins, crossed screws, and <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> constructs [6]. The femora treated with <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> constructs had a greater stiffness and load to failure {{than the other two}} groups. The <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> group was 43 and 53  % stiffer than the intramedullary pin group and the crossed pin group, respectively. The failures noted in the <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> group were extra-articular, which as previously stated by Toy et al., is desirable compared to intra-articular failures [13]. The <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> were hypothesized to be stronger because they transferred the load from the joint surface to the intact femoral shaft more effectively than the other groups. The use of <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> has been shown by other groups to be an effective treatment in other orthopedic oncology reconstructions [14].|$|R
30|$|Our {{study showed}} a {{significant}} improvement in the stiffness and fatigue properties of proximal tibial defects treated with a <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> construct compared to three intramedullary Steinmann pins placed in an inverted tripod position. None of the <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> constructs failed during fatigue testing, while two of the other group failed with intra-articular fractures. The significant increase in fatigue properties likely translates into increased stability of the <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> construct over time. We believe that proximal tibial <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> represent a viable alternative treatment to the traditional treatment using Steinmann pin constructs.|$|R

30|$|<b>Locking</b> <b>plates</b> are {{fundamentally}} different from conventional plates [2, 3, 5]. The biomechanical properties of <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> are, more appropriately, likened to external fixators than traditional plates and screws [5, 17]. <b>Locking</b> <b>plates</b> rely on fixed angle screws to provide stability rather than the friction between the plate and bone generated by screw torque [17]. This intrinsic dissimilarity makes conventional <b>plates</b> and <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> suited for use in different clinical scenarios [3, 18]. Conventional plates are ideal for achieving union through primary bone healing, with precise reduction, interfragmentary compression and rigid fixation [5, 17, 18]. <b>Locking</b> <b>plates</b> {{on the other hand}} are better suited for providing elastic fixation that result in secondary fracture healing with callus formation [3, 5, 17, 18].|$|R
40|$|Fixation of {{fragility}} fractures with {{plates and}} screws {{often results in}} loss of fixation and need for revision surgery. <b>Locking</b> <b>plates</b> and screw were introduced to improve fixation of fragility fractures and have been in use for a decade. This review was conducted to compile evidence that <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> and screws improve fixation of fragility fractures. A search of PubMed was performed to identify biomechanical studies as well as clinical series of fragility fractures treated with <b>locking</b> <b>plates.</b> Biomechanics papers had to use models of osteoporotic bone and had to directly compare <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> with traditional plates. Clinical studies included case series in which <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> were applied to elderly patients with fractures of the proximal humerus and periprosthetic distal femur fractures. Most studies are retrospective case series. <b>Locking</b> <b>plates</b> lead to greater stability and higher loads to failure than traditional plates. When applied to proximal humerus fractures, uncomplicated healing occurs in 85 % of patients. Constant and Dash scores approach normal values. For distal femoral periprosthetic fractures, union rates of 75 % are reported with a malunion rate of 10 %. Early evidence suggests that <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> improve results of treatment of proximal humerus fractures and distal femoral periprosthetic fractures in the elderly. Loss of fixation is associated with failure to achieve stability at the fracture site.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Axial {{dynamization}} of fractures {{can promote}} healing, and overly stiff fixation can suppress healing. A novel technology, termed active plating, provides controlled axial dynamization by the elastic suspension of locking holes within the plate. This prospective, controlled animal study evaluated {{the effect of}} active plates on fracture-healing in an established ovine osteotomy model. We hypothesized that symmetric axial dynamization with active plates stimulates circumferential callus and delivers faster and stronger healing relative to standard <b>locking</b> <b>plates.</b> METHODS: Twelve sheep {{were randomly assigned to}} receive a standard <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> or an active <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> for stabilization of a 3 -mm tibial osteotomy gap. The only difference between <b>plates</b> was that <b>locking</b> holes of active plates were elastically suspended, allowing up to 1. 5 mm of axial motion at the fracture. Fracture-healing was analyzed weekly on radiographs. After sacrifice at nine weeks postoperatively, callus volume and distribution were assessed by computed tomography. Finally, to determine their strength, healed tibiae and contralateral tibiae were tested in torsion until failure. RESULTS: At each follow-up, the active <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> group had more callus (p < 0. 001) than the standard <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> group. At postoperative week 6, all active <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> group specimens had bridging callus at the three visible cortices.

50|$|The flash pan was {{at first}} {{attached}} to the gun barrel, but was later moved to the <b>lock</b> <b>plate</b> of the gun. A small amount of finely ground gunpowder {{is placed in the}} flash pan and ignited. The flash of flame travels through the touch hole igniting the main charge of propellant inside the barrel. Unlike the cannon, it was not necessary (or desirable) to place priming in the touch hole itself. The flash alone, and not particles of burning powder, was enough to ignite the main charge.|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Locked</b> bridge <b>plating</b> {{relies on}} {{secondary}} bone healing, which requires interfragmentary motion for callus formation. This study evaluated healing of fractures stabilized with a <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> construct and a far cortical locking construct, {{which is a}} modified <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> approach that promotes interfragmentary motion. The study tested whether far cortical locking constructs can improve fracture-healing compared with standard <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> constructs. Methods: In an established ovine tibial osteotomy model with a 3 -mm gap size, twelve osteotomies were randomly stabilized with <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> or far cortical locking constructs applied medially. The far cortical locking constructs were designed to provide 84 % lower stiffness than the <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> constructs and permitted nearly parallel gap motion. Fracture-healing was monitored on weekly radiographs. After the animals were killed at week 9, healed tibiae were analyzed by computed tomography, mechanical testing in torsion, and histological examination. Results: Callus on weekly radiographs was greater in the far cortical locking constructs than in the <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> constructs. At week 9, the far cortical locking group had a 36 % greater callus volume (p = 0. 03) and a 44 % higher bone mineral content (p = 0. 013) than the <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> group. Callus in the <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> specimens was asymmetric, having 49 % less bonemineral content in the medial callus than in the lateral callus (p = 0. 003). In far cortical locking specimens, medial and lateral callus had similar bone mineral content (p = 0. 91). The far cortical locking specimens healed to be 54 % stronger in torsion (p = 0. 023) and sustained 156 % greater energy to failure in torsion (p < 0. 001) than locked platin...|$|R
30|$|Prior to the {{availability}} of <b>locking</b> <b>plates</b> (that can rely on unicortical fixation), this technique was quite challenging given the need for bicortical screw purchase.

30|$|The {{emergence}} of <b>locked</b> <b>plate</b> technology for periarticular distal femur fracture fixation {{led to the}} design of a similar fixation construct for the proximal lateral tibia [17, 18]. <b>Locking</b> <b>plates</b> function as internal fixators with the locking screws creating a fixed angle construct providing angular stability. The fixed angle nature of the <b>locked</b> <b>plate</b> circumvents the need for additional medial stabilization, reducing the risk of injury to medial soft tissues [19]. Some literature has suggested that the use of <b>locked</b> <b>plate</b> technology to be biomechanically equivalent to the historical control of double plating [20 – 22], with the advantage of less soft tissue dissection. Numerous studies have reported successful outcomes with the use of single lateral <b>locking</b> <b>plate</b> fixation of complex bicondylar tibial plateau fractures [9, 20, 23 – 26]. Concerns arise when there is significant metaphyseal comminution for a long segment or with certain patterns of medial articular involvement that may not be adequately supported by the trajectory of fixation from a solely laterally based implant.|$|R

The records at the arsenal are not exact on the matter, as it appears the first 1803 prototype was produced six months after Lewis departed Maryland. The later 1803 rifles had a slightly lighter barrel than the first production run version, and had other slight differences such as a thinner <b>lock</b> <b>plate</b> and a narrower trigger guard.

Failure of a volar <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> is a rarely reported complication in the literature. Case Presentation A 40 year-old, obese female patient who {{presented with a}} displaced extraarticular distal radius fracture, underwent open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture using a volar <b>locking</b> <b>plate.</b> Radiographs taken at 10 weeks postoperatively showed failure of fixation with breakage of the four distal locking screws. A hardware removal was performed at 6 months, and the patient was then lost to follow-up. She presented again at 18 months after the first surgery, with significant pain, and radiographic signs of a radial collapse and a fracture-nonunion. A total wrist fusion was performed as the method of choice {{at that point in}} time. Conclusion Volar <b>locked</b> <b>plating</b> represents the new "gold standard" of distal radius fracture fixation. However, despite the stability provided by <b>locking</b> <b>plates,</b> hardware failure may occur and lead to a cascade of complications which will ultimately require a wrist fusion, as outlined in this case report.
