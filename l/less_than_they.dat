5|$|The labor {{situation}} in Jerome was complicated. Three separate labor unions—the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers (MMSW), the Industrial Workers of the World or IWW, and the Liga Protectora Latina, which represented about 500 Mexican miners—had members in Jerome. In 1917, two miners' strikes involving the IWW, {{which had been}} organizing strikes elsewhere in Arizona and other states, took place in Jerome. Seen as a threat by business interests {{as well as other}} labor unions, the Wobblies, as they were called, were subject nationally to sometimes violent harassment. The MMSW, which in May called a strike against United Verde, regarded the rival IWW with animosity and would not recognize it as legitimate. In response, the IWW members threatened to break the strike. Under pressure, the MMSW voted 467 to 431 to settle for <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> wanted.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of McKinley's {{election}} in 1896, African Americans were hopeful of progress towards equality. McKinley had spoken out against lynching while governor, and most African Americans who could vote supported him in 1896. McKinley's priority, however, was in ending sectionalism, and they were disappointed by his policies and appointments. Although McKinley made some appointments of African Americans to low-level government posts, and received some praise for that, the appointments were <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> had received under previous Republican administrations. Blanche K. Bruce, an African American who during Reconstruction had served as senator from Mississippi, received the post of register at the Treasury Department; this post was traditionally given to an African American by Republican presidents. McKinley appointed several black postmasters; however, when Democrats protested the appointment of Justin W. Lyons as postmaster of Augusta, Georgia, McKinley asked Lyons to withdraw (he was subsequently given the post of Treasury register after Bruce's death in 1898). The President did appoint George B. Jackson, a former slave, to the post of customs collector in Presidio, Texas. However, African Americans in northern states felt that their contributions to McKinley's victory were overlooked; few were appointed to office.|$|E

The boycott nevertheless has undoubtedly harmed Israel to some extent.

25|$|Governor Yates put Colonel Joseph H. Tucker, {{commanding}} the 60th Regiment, Illinois State Militia, {{in charge of}} building the camp. Yates also appointed Tucker as the camp's first commander. State militia troops called the Mechanics Fusiliers, who were apprentice and journeyman carpenters, built the barracks in October and November 1861. These troops mutinied on December 18, 1861 when the State of Illinois tried to press them into service as infantry upon completion of their work on Camp Douglas. The State paid them <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> believed they were promised for their work. Regular troops had to suppress the rioting construction troops and restore order to the camp.

25|$|The second {{match was}} a more even affair. It was held at Westpac Stadium, Wellington, on 24 January. New Zealand batted first and scored well in the early stages, but lost wickets at vital times, much of the damage being done by bowlers Andrew Bichel and Lance Klusener. Only Nathan Astle was able to produce a large score, {{finishing}} on 109. New Zealand were all out for 256, a respectable score, but <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> would have wanted on what was a good batting pitch. The total {{was never going to}} be enough, however, especially after Matthew Elliott and Nick Knight got the World XI off to a flying start. Elliott was particularly belligerent, his 57 runs including three sixes. Although the World XI lost several wickets, their batting continued at a fast pace, and they reached the required target in the 48th over for the loss of seven wickets.|$|E
25|$|British Intelligence did {{not predict}} {{the scale of}} Georgette, {{although}} in fairness the Germans were changing their plans frequently and only finalised their intentions {{a week or so}} beforehand. The Germans enjoyed significant artillery superiority (although <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> would have preferred after the intense fighting in the Somme sector) and some of the BEF line was held by poor-quality Portuguese divisions. Foch visited Haig at 1pm on 9 April, and again refused Haig’s demand that the French take over more BEF line so as to free up a British reserve. Haig felt that Foch’s proposal to deploy 4 French divisions west of Amiens would simply increase Rawlinson’s logistical troubles without doing much to help. On 10 April Georgette was extended northwards, as von Arnim’s Fourth Army also attacked, forcing the evacuation of Armentieres by Du Cane’s XV Corps. Haig yet again demanded that the French take over “some portion” of the British line and give French assistance “in order … to continue the battle”.|$|E

[...] Beginning in late 1959, the Mint {{failed to provide}} enough coins to satisfy demand, and the Fed, through its district banks and branches, imposed rationing. By 1963, there was often rationing of all denominations, commercial banks (and their retail customers) receiving <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> needed. There were widespread shortages of some denominations during the 1962 holiday shopping season. [...] Traditionally, the heavy demand for coinage {{late in the year}} resulted in a large amount of flowback in the winter, but in early 1963, few coins returned to the banks, or to the Fed. [...] Officials suggested responsibility might lie with coin collectors and investors, as well as uncollected coins remaining in the nation's millions of vending machines. The Mint increased production to around-the-clock shifts at Philadelphia and Denver. A new Philadelphia Mint was authorized in 1963, though the hoped-for opening date of 1966 was soon pushed back to 1967 (it eventually opened in 1969).|$|E
500|$|As the province's fiscal {{situation}} worsened in late 2008, {{the government}} adapted its health policy. In December, Liepert {{announced a new}} seniors drug plan that made drugs free for seniors making less than $21,325 but required those making more to {{pay as much as}} $7,500 for their drugs. In response to protests from seniors, he amended the plan in April 2009 to reduce both the income level at which seniors would have to start paying and the amount which those seniors would have to pay. Liepert said that the plan, $10 million more expensive than the one he had announced in December, would see 60% of seniors pay <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> did under the status quo. The same month, Stelmach's government's budget revealed changes to which medical services it would cover: those de-listed included chiropractic services, at an annual savings of $53 million, and sex change operations, at an annual savings of $700,000.
