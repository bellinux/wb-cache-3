6000|$|He was {{answered}} by a whoop of ecstasy, {{and before he}} was well out of the carriage, he was seized by the joyous Maurice, shouting {{that he had been}} for a ride with papa, without a <b>leading</b> <b>rein.</b> Happy age for both, too young to know more than that the beloved playfellow was at home again! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We will go quietly at first, anyhow. Mind, as you mount, {{put your}} left foot in the stirrup. When you are seated, carry {{yourself}} as easily as you can. The pony looks quiet enough, but if, when we get fairly off, you find that you cannot sit comfortably, you must get up before me, and Ibrahim must lead your pony. When we are fairly on the road, I will fasten a bit of rope to your bridle {{to act as a}} <b>leading</b> <b>rein,</b> and you can ride by my side, unless we see people coming along; then you must drop behind, with Ibrahim." ...|$|E
60|$|But, as this {{fair and}} modest dame noway aspired to {{the skill of}} a charioteer, the {{management}} of a horse, which seemed {{as old as the}} carriage he drew, was in the exclusive charge of an old fellow in a postilion's jacket, whose grey hairs escaped on each side of an old-fashioned velvet jockey-cap, and whose left shoulder was so considerably elevated above his head, that it seemed, as if, with little effort, his neck might have been tucked under his arm, like that of a roasted grouse-cock. This gallant equerry was mounted on a steed as old as that which toiled betwixt the shafts of the carriage, and which he guided by a <b>leading</b> <b>rein.</b> Goading one animal with his single spur, and stimulating the other with his whip, he effected a reasonable trot upon the causeway, which only terminated when the whiskey stopped at Mr. Bindloose's door--an event of importance enough to excite the curiosity of the inhabitants of that and the neighbouring houses. Wheels were laid aside, needles left sticking in the half-finished seams, and many a nose, spectacled and unspectacled, was popped out of the adjoining windows, which {{had the good fortune to}} command a view of Mr. Bindloose's front door. The faces of two or three giggling clerks were visible at the barred casements of which we have spoken, much amused at the descent of an old lady from this respectable carriage, whose dress and appearance might possibly have been fashionable at the time when her equipage was new. A satin cardinal, lined with grey squirrels' skin, and a black silk bonnet, trimmed with crape, were garments which did not now excite the respect, which in their fresher days they had doubtless commanded. But there was that in the features of the wearer, which would have commanded Mr. Bindloose's best regard, though it had appeared in far worse attire; for he beheld the face of an ancient customer, who had always paid her law expenses with the ready penny, and whose accompt with the bank was balanced by a very respectable sum at her credit. It was, indeed, no other than our respected friend, Mrs. Dods of the Cleikum Inn, St. Ronan's, Aultoun.|$|E
6000|$|... "We will go at an easy canter now, Annie. If {{you feel}} as if you could not keep on, call out, and we will stop directly; but first come up between Surajah and myself, and we will take the <b>leading</b> <b>reins,</b> so that you will have nothing to attend to but holding on." ...|$|R
60|$|James {{the coachman}} was {{more afraid of}} his {{mistress}} than the mob, probably, for he whipped on his horses as he was bidden, and the post-boy that rode with the first pair (my lady always rode with her coach-and-six,) gave a cut of his thong over the shoulders of one fellow who put his hand out towards the <b>leading</b> horse's <b>rein.</b>|$|R
60|$|Half an hour later, {{a number}} of horsemen, {{followed}} by {{a crowd of people}} on foot, poured out from the eastern gate. One of the <b>leading</b> horsemen drew <b>rein</b> for a moment as he passed the group of Arabs.|$|R

50|$|A green horse, {{that has}} never jumped, should first be {{introduced}} to a ditch on the <b>leading</b> <b>rein,</b> which should be held loose. The master should cross the obstacle first, and then pull the <b>leading</b> <b>rein</b> tight to encourage the horse to follow. If he does not, a whip should be applied smartly. Xenophon mentions that the horse will not only clear the obstacle, but will overjump it, and will thereafter not require a switch to entice him to jump but simply the sight of someone coming behind him. When the horse is comfortable jumping in this manner, he may be mounted and ridden first over small, and then over larger, trenches.|$|E
50|$|The Earl {{was born}} {{partially}} sighted and was blind {{for most of}} his life, but this did not prevent him from leading a highly active lifestyle. He travelled extensively, to Europe, Russia and Egypt. He also rode, with a <b>leading</b> <b>rein</b> held by a mounted groom though he fell and dislocated his hip in 1908.|$|E
60|$|And a very wet and {{slightly}} snowy journey they had, 'meeting in snow and parting in snow,' as Hal said, as he marched by Anne's bridle- <b>rein,</b> <b>leading</b> her pony, {{so as to}} leave her hands free to hold cloak and hood close about her.|$|R
5000|$|Carolyn Menyes from Music Times {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "With a cool {{sense of confidence}} and rhymes that boast of her own sexual and rapping prowess, Minaj is taking the <b>reins,</b> <b>leading</b> into the equally vulgar and explosive rap verses from Drake and Wayne". Brennan Carley from Spin said [...] ""Only" [...] is Nicki at her dirtiest and smartest, rapping with metaphors that'd fly over other rappers' heads while keeping the glint of a knowing wink always in her eye." [...] Miles Raymer from Entertainment Weekly praised Minaj's rap and called it {{the best part of}} the song.|$|R
50|$|To mount, {{the rider}} {{should take the}} <b>leading</b> <b>rein</b> (presumably there was a third rein for leading the horse) {{in his left hand}} and hold it slack. With his right hand he should grasp the reins, along with a small lock of mane so that he does not hit the horse in the mouth when he mounts. The rider should not hit the horse in the back when he mounts, but bring his leg {{completely}} over.|$|E
50|$|A single rein or rope may be {{attached}} to a halter to lead or guide a horse or packhorse. A long rein called a longe line {{may be used to}} allow the horse to move in a circle for training purposes, or for the purpose of a clinical lameness evaluation by a veterinarian. On certain designs of headgear, a third rein may be added to the paired reins, used for leading, longeing, or other specialized or stylistic purposes. The best-known example of a third rein used in the USA is the <b>leading</b> <b>rein</b> of the mecate of the classic bosal hackamore.|$|E
50|$|Horse {{shows in}} Australia {{are governed by}} Equestrian Australia, Show Horse Council of Australia and {{different}} breed societies. Much {{of the development of}} the show horse (also referred to as saddle horse) discipline was developed over the last 40 years by Fran Cleland through her involvement with the Equestrian Federation of Australia's (EFA) Victorian branch (now known as EV). Fran Cleland is the wife of Reg Cleland who was the longest serving Chairman of the Victorian branch of the EFA which was in turn responsible for running The Barastoc Horse of The Year Show the premier horse Show in Australia for over 40 years and under the direction of Fran Cleland introduced Newcomer, Show-hunter, <b>leading</b> <b>rein,</b> first ridden, owner rider and working Hunter classes into the Australian Show Horse scene.|$|E
5000|$|Yasmah-Adad's critiques did {{not come}} solely from his father; however, as is {{demonstrated}} in several correspondences {{between him and his}} older brother. Ishme-Dagan scolds his brother, [...] "Why are you setting up a wail about this thing? That is not great conduct," [...] and eventually advises him to communicate with their father through him as intermediary. This might have been out of a desire to help his younger brother, but it could also have been a maneuver to gain Ishme-Dagan more political standing. He indicates his desire to be the intermediary between his brother and father in letters with such phrases as, [...] "Write me what you are intending to write to the king, so that, where possible, I can advise you myself."Another example of the complicated, strained relationship between the brothers is found in a letter written by Yasmah-Adad to his brother Ishme-Dagan:"Thus (speaks) Yasmah-Addu, Your son. I listened to the Tablet which Daddy sent me, which ran as follow: 'How much longer do we have to keep you on a <b>leading</b> <b>rein?</b> You are a child, you are not a man, you have no beard on your chin! How much longer are you going to fail running your household properly? Don't you realize that your brother is commanding enormous armies? so you (jolly well) command your palace and household properly!' That is what Daddy wrote to me. Now, how can I be a child and incapable of directing affairs when daddy promoted me? How is it that, although I grew up with Daddy from when I was tiny, now some servant or other has succeeded in ousting me from Daddy's affections? So I am coming to Daddy right now, to have it out with daddy about my unhappiness!" [...] (ARM 1.108: Dalley 1984;34)Historical opinion of Yasmah-Adad revolves mainly around these letters, because they are the most abundant primary sources written about Yasmah-Adad. This criticism possibly reflects the stress that Shamshi-Adad I felt as his newly formed empire already began to crumble; considering, as pointed out by Yasmah-Adad in this letter, his father did appoint Yasmah-Adad as a chief ruler of Mari, one of the largest urban centers, as well as being one of the most disputed in his kingdom, when one of his generals could have also filled the position. Yasmah-Adad managed the region well considering the Ashur kingdom was under attack from outside and inside its borders. However, other sources may support his father's belief. Most primary sources from the era do not mention any military action on his part. When his father died, Zimri-Lim was able to chase Yasmah-Adad out of the throne in Mari seemingly without much of a fight, while his brother Ishme-Dagan lost control of all of his portion of his father's kingdom save for Ekallatum and Assur.|$|E
