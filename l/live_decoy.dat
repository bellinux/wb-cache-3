50|$|Das {{sent the}} poem to Paricay on {{the request of}} the poet Bishnu Dey, one of the editors of the magazine. Another editor, Sudhindranath Datta, deemed the poem incomprehensible and denied to publish it. Bishnu Dey, however, managed the poem get published. After its publication, the {{literary}} critic Sajanikanta Das accused Das of obscenity. Most of controversies rose from Das’ use of the expression “ghai harini” which in English means “doe in heat”. “Harini” is a Bengali word intelligible to everyone; but “ghai”, an etymologically Assamese word, is used in Bengali by professional hunters to refer to a <b>live</b> <b>decoy</b> used to lure game. Das’ brother Ashokanananda Das suggested that Das who never hunted in his life might have learned the word in his youth from professional hunters who did expeditions into the mangrove forest Sundarbans, which was in the vicinity of Barisal, the hometown of Das.|$|E

40|$|International audienceStudies of waterbirds rely to a {{large extent}} on ringing and resighting or {{recapture}} data, whilst assuming that ringed birds are broadly representative of the population as a whole. This may not be the case if the capture process may in itself have an influence on the birds. The analyses presented here showed that the body mass of ringed ducks often decreases between capture and recapture if the latter occurs within a few days or weeks. This could possibly reflect stress caused by handling, which would be problematic if it causes ringed birds to behave in a way that differs from the population as a whole. Alternatively, body mass measurements could also be biased by the general use of bait to attract birds to the trap. Initial and subsequent body mass data recorded for Eurasian Teal Anas crecca caught then recaptured within three weeks were compared between sites where the birds were attracted to traps with bait or with <b>live</b> <b>decoys.</b> When bait was used individuals had a greater body mass at ringing but were lighter at recapture at all but one site, where only a marginal difference was found. Conversely, when using <b>live</b> <b>decoys,</b> body mass remained constant at the next capture event. This suggests that mass loss commonly observed between capture and recapture is not caused by handling, but is potentially an artefact linked to duck hyperphagia in the presence of abundant food at ringing. It also implies that most available duck body mass data, which are usually obtained from birds ringed at baited traps, may be artificially inflated. The present results are based on one single unbaited site, however, and experimental manipulative studies (alternating the use of bait and <b>live</b> <b>decoys</b> to trap birds) are needed to confirm the findings...|$|R

5000|$|Crowell's father, Anthony S. Crowell, was a mariner and {{cranberry}} grower who may {{not have}} even cared much for hunting. Despite this, he bought Elmer his first gun in 1874, when the boy was 12. The land around their East Harwich, Massachusetts, home was rich in game and waterfowl, the numerous ponds and bays were a haven for sportsmen and market gunners from all over. Anthony Crowell owned property on Pleasant Lake near where the Crowells lived and Elmer built a gunning stand there in 1876. The stand stayed for many years while Elmer shot ducks, geese, and on occasion, shorebirds. Despite this early interest in hunting, Crowell long favored <b>live</b> <b>decoys</b> to the block variety, perhaps proving that his career in carving block decoys didn't start until later on. In 1947, Crowell related in his article, [...] "Cape Cod Memories," [...] that, [...] "The shooting was great. But we could not sell them in the markets, as the law cut it out. Soon the law cut out the <b>live</b> <b>decoys,</b> {{and that was the end}} of good shooting there." [...] Crowell certainly didn't begin making decoys to support himself until later in life. By the late 1920s, Crowell's decoys were being churned out at a prodigious rate, and the quality suffered. For this reason, decoys of his from this period are slightly less desirable than those made earlier.|$|R
50|$|In Europe, the 1979 Birds Directive and its {{amendments}} {{seeks to}} protect wild birds and allows hunting only within certain limits. According to the Directive use of traps, bird lime (glue), nets, <b>live</b> <b>decoys</b> and poison is forbidden {{at all times}} and birds are protected during breeding and spring migration. Malta joined the European Union in 2004 and obtained certain exemptions from the protective laws that apply to the membership states regarding wild birds. Trapping of several types of finches was allowed for five years until 2009 when the derogation was phased out. Malta had about 4,700 licensed trappers in 2007 who, by exemption from European protective laws, continue to trap quail, turtle doves, golden plovers and song thrushes. Further, illegal trapping {{continues to be a}} problem in Malta. In North America the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 and its amendments protect wild birds.|$|R
50|$|There were no {{regulations}} on waterfowl hunting from when the Paleo Indians arrived in North America {{to the early}} 20th century. In the early 20th century large shotguns and rifles were used. Traps were used. <b>Live</b> <b>decoys</b> were used in front of blinds, as well as shotguns holding many shells. Hunting was done throughout the year. In 1913 the United States Congress passed the Weeks-McLean Act regulating waterfowl hunting, however the states were successful in arguing that the constitution gave no such regulatory power to the federal government, and the statute was struck down. In response, the United States negotiated the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 with the United Kingdom (which {{at the time was}} largely responsible for Canada's foreign affairs) covering the same substance, but would be constitutional because of the Supremacy Clause.

60|$|When {{the first}} birds {{come in to}} the feeding grounds before dark, they {{do it with the}} {{greatest}} caution, examining not only the little pond or creek, but the whole neighborhood before lighting. The birds that follow trust to the inspection of these first comers, and generally fly straight in. For this reason it is well for one who attempts to see them at this time to have <b>live</b> <b>decoys</b> and, if possible, to have his blind built several days in advance, in order that the birds which may have been feeding in the place shall see no unusual object when they come in. If the blind be newly built, only the stranger birds will fly straight in to his decoys. Those that have been there before will either turn away in alarm, or else examine the blind very cautiously on all sides. If you know now how to wait and sit perfectly still, the birds will at last fly directly over the stand to look in. That is your only chance; and you must take it quickly if you expect to eat duck for dinner.|$|R

40|$|Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a small, gram-negative, motile {{bacterium}} that preys upon other gram-negative bacteria, {{including several}} known human pathogens. Its predation efficiency is usually studied in pure cultures containing solely B. bacteriovorus and a suitable prey. However, in natural environments, {{as well as}} in any possible biomedical uses as an antimicrobial, Bdellovibrio is predatory in the presence of diverse <b>decoys,</b> including <b>live</b> nonsusceptible bacteria, eukaryotic cells, and cell debris. Here we gathered and mathematically modeled data from three-member cultures containing predator, prey, and nonsusceptible bacterial decoys. Specifically, we studied the rate of predation of planktonic late-log-phase Escherichia coli S 17 - 1 prey by B. bacteriovorus HD 100, both in the presence {{and in the absence of}} Bacillus subtilis nonsporulating strain 671, which acted as a <b>live</b> bacterial <b>decoy.</b> Interestingly, we found that although addition of the <b>live</b> Bacillus <b>decoy</b> did decrease the rate of Bdellovibrio predation in liquid cultures, this addition also resulted in a partially compensatory enhancement of the availability of prey for predation. This effect resulted in a higher final yield of Bdellovibrio than would be predicted for a simple inert decoy. Our mathematical model accounts for both negative and positive effects of predator-prey-decoy interactions in the closed batch environment. In addition, it informs considerations for predator dosing in any future therapeutic applications and sheds some light on considerations for modeling the massively complex interactions of real mixed bacterial populations in nature...|$|R
40|$|For several decades, {{blackbird}} depredation of sunflower {{has been}} a continuous problem. Sunflower growers consistently place blackbirds in the top tier of problems associated with growing sunflower in the northern Great Plains. Many non-lethal tactics have been employed {{in an attempt to}} protect ripening sunflower from foraging flocks of blackbirds. Thinning cattail-choked wetlands to reduce roosting habitat, using pyrotechniques to frighten feeding birds, planting Wildlife Conservation Sunflower Plots to lure birds away from commercial plots, applying taste repellents, and adapting cultural methods such as block planting to synchronize ripening are just a few such tactics. Even so, the numbers of blackbirds migrating through the northern Great Plains can overwhelm non-lethal techniques. That is, in some circumstances there are too many blackbirds for non-lethal techniques to be effective. One avicide, DRC- 1339, is registered for use as a lethal bait in the U. S. and North Dakota. The avicide is usually mixed with brown rice at a ratio of 1 : 25 (treated rice kernel to untreated rice kernels). Normally, the rice mixture is broadcast {{on the ground in the}} ripening or sprouting crop. Non-blackbirds are plentiful in ripening sunflower fields, causing a potential risk to these species with the use of DRC- 1339. These granivorous non-blackbirds might eat treated rice, causing an unintentional loss. A number of species of songbirds and sparrows could be at risk. Also, ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) and mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) are species of high concern. One potential method of avoiding non-blackbirds is to put <b>live</b> <b>decoys</b> (blackbirds) in cages in areas devoid of habitat to attract free-living blackbirds to bait trays attached to the top of the decoy cages. The intent is to reduce large concentrations of blackbirds that cannot be otherwise dispersed by non-lethal means. The objective of this study is to identify and quantify the avian species visiting the bait trays. Our goal is to develop an effective and environmentally-safe method for managing locally abundant blackbird populations...|$|R

40|$|As {{numbers of}} wild ducks {{declined}} and hunting opportunities became more restricted in the mid- 1980 s, interest in shooting captive-reared mallards on shooting preserves increased dramatically. In 1985, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) received {{a series of}} letters regarding the interpretation of regulations in 50 CFR 21. 13 and the practice in Maryland of releasing captive-reared mallards in a freeflying condition on their State-licensed shooting preserves. Prior to this time, shooting preserves released flighted mallards from towers as a general practice to be shot immediately after release and maintained tighter control to prevent these birds from escaping to the wild. The Service responded to the State of Maryland by strictly reiterating the intent of these regulations, mainly “ [...] . that such birds may be killed by shooting, in any number, at any time, {{within the confines of}} any premises operated as a shooting preserve under State license, permit, or authorization. ” Since then, the practice of releasing captive-reared mallards on State-licensed shooting preserves has been more broadly interpreted to allow releases of freeflying birds. As a result of this de facto policy, the number of shooting preserves grew significantly in some areas. However, this practice has become more controversial as large numbers of these birds are being released into areas where they are free to intermingle with wild populations of migratory waterfowl. At the urging of the four Flyway Councils and the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (now Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, AFWA), the Service was asked to conduct a review of the potential conflicts of releasing free-flying captive-reared mallards on State-licensed shooting preserves and to assess the resulting effects upon migratory waterfowl. With assistance from States and Flyway Councils, all aspects pertaining to enforcement of various regulatory statutes, genetic introgression, disease transmission, and impacts upon waterfowl management programs of wildlife agencies (e. g., population monitoring, banding, and harvest surveys) were examined during 2001 - 02, including authority and jurisdiction under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). Based upon this review, the Service’s Division of Migratory Bird Management concludes that releasing and shooting of captive-reared mallards on shooting preserves results in greater potential for violations of regulatory statutes, in particular, Federal waterfowl hunting regulations involving <b>live</b> <b>decoys,</b> baiting, over-bagging, and take of wild ducks out of season. The inability to distinguish between captive-reared and wild mallards in flight and the potential for problems caused by these birds intermixing, both on and off shooting preserves, {{are at the heart of}} law-enforcement issues regarding releases of free-flying captive-reared mallards on shooting preserves. If a hunter happens to take a wild duck on a shooting preserve, all hunting prohibitions will apply to that “take. ...|$|R
40|$|I studied {{aspects of}} {{the ecology of the}} Murray River turtle, Emydura macquarii, to {{determine}} the impact of the introduced red fox, Vulpes vulpes. The fox is one of Australia's worst vertebrate pests through its predation on livestock and native mammals, but their impact on reptilian communities is not known. I conducted a large-scale mark-recapture study to evaluate population growth of E. macquarii in the Albury region of the upper Murray River by determining growth, reproduction and survival. The study was conducted downstream of the first, and largest, impoundment on the Murray River, Lake Hume. Emydura macquarii predominantly inhabit the lagoons in the upper Murray River, as the mainstream and Lake are possibly too cool to maintain metabolic processes. They are easily captured in hoop traps and the use of <b>live</b> <b>decoys</b> maximises trap success. Over 2000 hatchling turtles were marked and released into two lagoons between January 1997 and January 1998. Growth of these individuals is rapid over the first few years but declines towards maturity, and is indeterminate after maturity. Although growth annuli are not well defined, even on young individuals, the von Bertalanffy model describes the growth of both male and female E. macquarii. Male turtles mature at 5 - 6 years and females mature at 10 - 12 years. Female turtles may maximise reproductive potential by delaying maturity and producing one relatively large clutch (mean = 21 eggs) per year, which is positively correlated with body size (PL). Although primarily related to body size, clutch size varies annually because of environmental conditions. If winter and summer rainfalls are below average and temperatures are above average, E. macquarii may reduce clutch size to increase the chance of the eggs surviving. Nesting predominantly occurs during the first major rain-bearing depression in November. Habitat variables, including distance from water, nearest nest, and tree, and soil type were measured for each nest to determine characteristics that attract predators. Nests close to the shoreline and trees are heavily preyed on, and nests constructed in sand {{are less likely to be}} destroyed by predators. Foxes detect nests through a combination of chemical cues from eggs and slight soil disturbances, whereas birds only destroy nests observed being constructed during the day. Female turtles alter nesting behaviour and construct nests much further away from water when foxes were removed and as a result, nests are less dense and away from trees. Thus in high predation risk areas, turtles minimise emergence and search times to reduce the risk of direct predation by foxes. Predation is reduced when nests are in lower densities and away from trees, because predators increase search efforts when nests are in higher densities and birds are more likely to destroy nests close to trees. Reproductive success is further reduced in high predation risk areas because more nests are constructed in sandy substrates where clutch success is reduced compared to incubation in more dense substrates. Where predators are a significant source of mortality, prey may use indirect methods, such as chemical recognition, to avoid encounters. Nesting turtles did not avoid areas where fox odour was present, suggesting that they assess predation pressure from foxes by other mechanisms, such as visual recognition. However, an innate response occurs to the odour of a once common predator on the Murray River, the eastern quoll (Dasyurus viverrinus), whereby turtles recognise and avoid nesting in areas where quoll odour is present. Therefore nesting turtles show a similar avoidance response to two different predators, using different mechanisms of detection. Similarly, predation risk may influence hatching times and nest emergence. The rate of embryonic development of E. macquarii may increase or eggs may hatch early so that the clutch hatches synchronously, thereby reducing the risk of predation through group emergence from the nest. Emydura macquarii reach densities of over 100 turtles. ha- 1, with the majority of the population consisting of sexually mature individuals. Emydura macquarii has a Type III survival curve where mortality is extremely high in the egg stage (93 % nest predation), remaining high over the hatchling stage (minimum survival rate- 10 %), but decreasing rapidly throughout the juvenile stage (~ 70 % juvenile survival). Adult survival is extremely high, with greater than 95 % of adults surviving each year. Foxes through nest predation cause most mortality but a small proportion (~ 3 %) of nesting adult females are killed by foxes each year. A removal program evaluated the impact of foxes. In 1996, fox numbers were monitored around four lagoons by spotlighting and non-toxic bait uptake. Foxes were removed from around two of the lagoons throughout 1997 and 1998, using spotlight shooting and 1080 bait poisoning. Fox numbers were continually monitored around all four lagoons during the study. Nest predation rates remained around 90 % in all sites where foxes were present, but fell to less than 50 % when foxes were removed. At the same time, predation on nesting female turtles was eliminated where foxes were removed. Demographic models using staged based survival schedules, together with growth and fecundity values for E. macquarii show a decline of 4 % per year in these populations. Elasticity analyses shows that survival of adult female E. macquarii has the major influence on population stability and a reduction of nest predation alone is unlikely to address the population decline. Management options, such as reducing foxes prior to nesting around key lagoons, will stabilise the population decline, and eliminating foxes completely from certain areas with high dispersal potential, will promote recruitment of juvenile E. macquarii...|$|R
