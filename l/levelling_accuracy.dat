40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the design of}} a passive {{self-levelling}} device is presented. Self-levelling means that the device adjusts itself to compensate for inclinations of the floor without user intervention. This has the advantage that a single device can be used on floors with various inclinations without losing its functionality. First an analysis is presented on functions (e. g. levelling, measuring and locking) and strategies (possible orders in which these functions take place) that are useful for selflevelling devices. After this a prototype of the designed device is presented and tested on its <b>levelling</b> <b>accuracy</b> for inclinations of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees relative to the horizontal. The test results show that the system for most inclinations can level its platform within a 3 degrees deviation from the values that were expected based on a computer modelBMDBioMechanical EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E

Arbitrary assignments of sample points to certain script lines are hypothesized and described in a trellis.

40|$|In {{this work}} we further {{evaluate}} a recently published, novel vector quantization (VQ) design for discrete HMM-based on-line handwriting recognition of whiteboard notes. To decorrelate the features, a {{principal component analysis}} (PCA) is applied. The novel VQ design ensures a lossless representation of the pressure information while modeling the statistical dependencies between the pressure and the remaining features. This is necessary because standard k-Means VQ systems cannot quantize this binary feature adequately although they have been decorrelated, which is shown in this paper. Our experiments show that the new system provides a relative improvement of r = 2. 8 % in character <b>level</b> <b>accuracy</b> and a relative improvement of r = 3. 3 % in word <b>level</b> <b>accuracy</b> compared to a standard k-means VQ system. Additionally our system is compared and proven to be competitive to a stateof-the-art continuous HMM system yielding a relative improvement of r = 1. 4 %.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the influence of THRASS (Teaching Handwriting, Reading and Spelling Skills) on the word <b>level</b> <b>accuracy</b> skills of a group of grade 2 learners. Word <b>level</b> <b>accuracy</b> is one sub skill in learning to read and is an indicator of the word recognition abilities of the child. THRASS is a program that has been designed to systematically teach phonics and, thus, teaches the basic building blocks of word sounds and structure so as to improve the childâ€™s decoding ability and word recognition ability. The research took place within the positivist paradigm and the methodology is quantitative in nature. The data collection method took the form of a one group pretest-posttest design, where a standardised reading test was administered prior to exposing the participants to the THRASS Program and then readministered one year later on the same group of learners. Data analysis took the form of statistical analysis to investigate any statistical significant difference in the word <b>level</b> <b>accuracy</b> skills of those Grade 2 learners. The result showed that over the period of a year the average reading accuracy age for the target population increased by four months. However, after statistical analysis the difference was not statistically significant. The Null Hypothesis that; exposing a group of Grade 2 learners to the THRASS Program for a period of one year will have no statistically significant influence on their word <b>level</b> <b>accuracy</b> skills cannot be rejected. However, the changes both in average reading accuracy as well as error patterns have inspired recommendations for further research. CopyrightDissertation (MEd) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

40|$|ABSTRACT. In the {{analysis}} of microarray data, and in some other contemporary statistical problems, {{it is not uncommon}} to apply hypothesis tests in a highly simultaneous way. The number, N say, of tests used can be much larger than the sample sizes, n, to which the tests are applied, yet we wish to calibrate the tests so that the overall level of the simultaneous test is accurate. Often the sampling distribution is quite different for each test, so there may not be an opportunity for combining data across samples. In this setting, how large can N be, as a function of n, before <b>level</b> <b>accuracy</b> becomes poor? In the present paper we answer this question in cases where the statistic under test is of Studentâ€™s t type. We show that if either Normal or Studentâ€™s t distribution is used for calibration then the level of the simultaneous test is accurate provided log N increases at a strictly slower rate than n 1 / 3 as n diverges. On the other hand, if bootstrap methods are used for calibration then we may choose log N almost as large as n 1 / 2 and still achieve asymptotic <b>level</b> <b>accuracy.</b> The implications of these results are explored both theoretically and numerically.
