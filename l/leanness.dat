5|$|The Upanishad {{suggests}} {{breathing exercises}} {{in a variety}} of ways, such as breathing with one nostril and exhaling with another, asserting that a regular practice multiple times a day cleans up the Nadis (blood vessels), improves digestive powers, stamina, <b>leanness</b> and causes the skin to glow. The text recommends restraining oneself from salt, mustard, acidic foods, spicy astringent pungent foods. The text also states that the yoga student should avoid fasting, early morning baths, sexual intercourse, and sitting near fire. Milk and ghee (clarified butter), cooked wheat, green gram and rice are foods the text approves of, in verses 46–49. The Upanishad also recommends massage, particularly areas of body that tremor or profusely perspire during the practice of yoga.|$|E

25|$|Swine judging is {{the process}} of {{selectively}} ordering swine or domestic pigs {{in order to determine the}} best pig. For market hogs, traits are ranked in order of their importance: Degree of muscling, growth, capacity or volume, degree of <b>leanness,</b> structure and soundness.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{agriculture}} {{employs a}} number of techniques, such as progeny testing, to speed artificial selection by breeding animals to rapidly acquire the qualities desired by meat producers. For instance, {{in the wake of}} well-publicised health concerns associated with saturated fats in the 1980s, the fat content of United Kingdom beef, pork and lamb fell from 20–26 percent to 4–8 percent within a few decades, due to both selective breeding for <b>leanness</b> and changed methods of butchery. Methods of genetic engineering aimed at improving the meat production qualities of animals are now also becoming available.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{being more}} {{famous for its}} Sauvignon blanc production, Chardonnay was New Zealand's most widely planted grape variety from 1990 till 2002 when Sauvignon blanc finally surpassed it. The east coast of the North Island, in places like Hawke's Bay and Wairarapa, have seen the most success with Chardonnay wine that has {{noticeable}} acidity and <b>leanness.</b> As better clonal varieties are discovered and planted, {{the overall quality of}} New Zealand Chardonnay have increased, particularly from places like Canterbury, Marlborough and Nelson. Some producers in the Gisborne region have recently developed a cult following for their Chardonnay among New Zealand wine drinkers. While many New Zealand winemakers are still developing a characteristic style, the Chardonnay produced so far have emphasized the grape's affinity for oak.|$|E
25|$|The {{village of}} Rully {{produces}} {{about twice as}} much white Chardonnay than red Pinot noir wines. As of 2008, there was about 756 acres (306 hectares) planted in this area. The soil of the area is sandy and light, producing light bodied wines that are best consumed young. The area is {{a major source of}} sparkling Crémant de Bourgogne which benefit from cooler vintages. In warmer years the wines tend to be lively with the whites showing apple notes. More than one sixth of all the vineyards in Rully have premier cru designations. The red wines of Rully tend to have more simple fruit notes, while the higher-quality white wines can display crisp <b>leanness</b> with lemon and nutty notes. The red wines tend to drink at their peak between 5–12 years after vintage while the whites usually drink well between 3–8 years.|$|E
2500|$|While [...] "Copland's musical rhetoric {{has become}} iconic" [...] and [...] "has {{functioned as a}} mirror of America," [...] {{conductor}} Leon Botstein suggests that the composer [...] "helped define the modern consciousness of America's ideals, character and sense of place. The notion that his music played not a subsidiary but {{a central role in}} the shaping of the national consciousness makes Copland uniquely interesting, for the historian as well as the musician." [...] Composer Ned Rorem states, [...] "Aaron stressed simplicity: Remove, remove, remove what isn't needed.... Aaron brought <b>leanness</b> to America, which set the tone for our musical language throughout [...] Thanks to Aaron, American music came into its own." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Muscovy duck {{has been}} domesticated for centuries, and is widely traded as [...] "Barbary duck". Muscovy breeds are popular {{because they have}} stronger-tasting meat—sometimes {{compared}} to roasted beef—than the usual domestic ducks which are descendants of the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). The meat is lean {{when compared to the}} fatty meat of mallard-derived ducks, its <b>leanness</b> and tenderness being often compared to veal. Muscovy ducks are also less noisy, and sometimes marketed as a [...] "quackless" [...] duck; even though they are not completely silent, they don't actually quack (except in cases of extreme stress). The carcass of a Muscovy duck is also much heavier than most other domestic ducks, which makes it ideal for the dinner table.|$|E
60|$|She {{studied him}} for a moment attentively. His <b>leanness</b> was the <b>leanness</b> of muscular {{strength}} and condition, his face was full of vigour and determination.|$|E
60|$|He {{spread his}} hands, long and almost {{transparent}} in their <b>leanness,</b> {{and on his}} face a cloud of sorrow rested.|$|E
60|$|A tall, big man, whose {{proportions}} at once disappointed Harry's {{preconceived notions}} {{as to the}} smallness and <b>leanness</b> of Frenchmen, rose from the table at which he was writing.|$|E
60|$|Morgan {{stopped in}} their walk, {{looking up at}} him. He had to look up much less {{than a couple of}} years before—he had grown, in his loose <b>leanness,</b> so long and high. “Finish me?” he echoed.|$|E
60|$|Mattie's reverie was {{interrupted}} by Selena. Angular, pale-eyed Mrs. Ford was as unlike the plump, rosy Mattie as a sister could be. Perhaps her chronic curiosity, which would not let her rest, was accountable for her excessive <b>leanness.</b>|$|E
6000|$|You ask {{after my}} health; I am in {{tolerable}} <b>leanness,</b> which I promote by exercise and abstinence. I don't know that I have acquired any thing by my travels but {{a smattering of}} two languages and a habit of chewing Tobacco. [1] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Choose. You {{will find}} there is vexation, and liveliness {{and much of}} it, in {{the centre of the}} dog-killing yard when the sun cooks your sore joints till the grease of the <b>leanness</b> of you bubbles like the tender fat of a cooked sucking-pig." ...|$|E
60|$|The whole {{establishment}} at Benfield Lodge, {{were drawn}} up to receive {{them on the}} following day in the great hall, and in the centre was fixed the upright and lank figure of its master, with his companion in <b>leanness,</b> honest Peter Johnson, on his right.|$|E
6000|$|Long {{fled the}} foam-flakes around me, the winds fled {{out of the}} vast, [...] Snatching the bird in secret, nor knew I, embosomed apart, [...] When they froze the cloth on my body like armour riveted fast, [...] For Remembrance, lifting her <b>leanness,</b> keened in the gates of my [...] heart.|$|E
6000|$|Now blotches rankling, {{coloured}} gay and grim, [...] Now patches {{where some}} <b>leanness</b> of the soil's [...] Broke into moss or substances like boils; Then came some palsied oak, a cleft in him Like a distorted mouth that splits its rim [...] Gaping at death, and dies while it recoils.|$|E
60|$|Grace {{noticed the}} {{hollowness}} of his quiet {{face and the}} <b>leanness</b> of his hard, scarred hands, and her heart grew soft towards him. The sign of the strain was plain upon him, though the breaking point {{had not yet been}} reached, and it was for her that he had done so much.|$|E
6000|$|Now blotches rankling, colored gay and grim, [...] Now patches {{where some}} <b>leanness</b> of the soil's [...] Broke into moss or {{substances}} like boils; [...] Then came some palsied oak, a cleft in him [...] Like a distorted mouth that splits its rim [...] 155 [...] Gaping at death, and dies while it recoils.|$|E
60|$|He {{opened the}} door of the theatre and halted in the chilly grey light that {{struggled}} through the dusty windows. A figure was crouching before the large grate and by its <b>leanness</b> and greyness he knew that it was the dean of studies lighting the fire. Stephen closed the door quietly and approached the fireplace.|$|E
6000|$|Maria. [...] With tame and credulous faith, [...] Mad melancholy, antic merriment, [...] 300 [...] <b>Leanness,</b> disquietude, {{and secret}} pangs!

6000|$|... 'Ay,' said Henry, laughing, 'you'd like to shew {{off one of}} your sledge- hammer blows--Sir Bras de Fer! But, Master Scot, {{you shall}} not smash the English shield so easily. This one hangs too loose to be safe; I shall keep it to serve me when we have fattened up at Paris, after the <b>leanness</b> of our siege.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "About the {{precious}} little one here Mamma {{is not to}} be [...] uneasy." [...] (Here follow some more precise details about the [...] health of this little Gold Son; omitted.) [...] "Of watching and [...] nursing he has no lack; that you may believe; and he is [...] indeed, a little <b>leanness</b> excepted, very lively and has a [...] good appetite.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} less of their <b>leanness</b> than of their smell," [...] I returned. [...] "Their odour when they approach me is not flowery, but {{resembles that of}} other dogs which feed on flesh, and have offended my too sensitive nostrils even in the drawing-rooms of Caracas. It is not like the fragrance of cattle when they return from the pasture." ...|$|E
6000|$|John, {{unable to}} contain his mirth at this {{discovery}} of a likeness between the prototype of Mr. Benfield himself in <b>leanness</b> of figure, and the jolly rotundity of the merchant, was obliged to leave the room; Emily, though she could not forbear smiling at the comparison, quietly said, [...] "You will meet him to-morrow, dear uncle, and then {{you will be able}} to judge for yourself." ...|$|E
60|$|The whole {{multitude}} then, except Forese, skimmed {{away like}} cranes, swift alike through eagerness and through <b>leanness.</b> Forese lingered {{a moment to}} have a parting word with his friend, and to prophesy the violent end of the chief of his family, Corso, run away with and dragged at {{the heels of his}} horse faster and faster, till the frenzied animal smites him dead. Having given the poet this information, the prophet speeded after the others.|$|E
60|$|He {{was lying}} on a small wooden fold-up bed, the scanty {{covering}} of which was supplemented by an overcoat and an elderly but still cheerful pair of check trousers, and he was wearing pajamas of a virulent pink and green. His neck seemed longer and more stringy {{than it had been}} even in our schooldays, and his upper lip had a wiry black moustache. The rest of his ruddy, knobby countenance, his erratic hair and his general hairy <b>leanness</b> had not even--to my perceptions grown.|$|E
60|$|Naab's peon {{came from}} a little cave in the wall; and grinned the {{greeting}} he could not speak. To Hare's uneducated eye all Indians resembled each other. Yet this one stood apart from the others, not differing in blanketed <b>leanness,</b> or straggling black hair, or bronze skin, but in the bird-of-prey cast of his features and the wildness of his glittering eyes. Naab gave him a bag {{from one of the}} packs, spoke a few words in Navajo, and then slapped the burros into the trail.|$|E
60|$|The girl {{noticed the}} <b>leanness</b> {{of his hands}} and the broken nails, and then glanced covertly at his face. It was gaunt and hollow, and she was {{sensible}} that there was a suggestion of weariness in his pose, which had, so far as she could remember, not been there before. Again a little thrill of compassion ran through her, and she felt, perhaps illogically, as she had done during the sonata, that no man could be wholly bad who played the violin as he did. Still, the last thing she intended doing was admitting it.|$|E
60|$|A certain <b>leanness</b> falls upon houses not {{sufficiently}} imbued with life (as {{if they were}} nourished upon it), which was very noticeable here. The staircase, balustrades, and rails, had a spare look--an air of being denuded to the bone--which the panels of {{the walls and the}} jambs of the doors and windows also bore. The scanty moveables partook of it; save for the cleanliness of the place, the dust--into which they were all resolving would have lain thick on the floors; and those, both in colour and in grain, were worn like old faces that had kept much alone.|$|E
60|$|Jane, {{greeting}} him, {{looked up}} into a face that she trusted instinctively and which riveted her attention. It had all {{the characteristics of the}} range rider's--the <b>leanness,</b> the red burn of the sun, and the set changelessness that came from years of silence and solitude. But it was not these which held her, rather the intensity of his gaze, a strained weariness, a piercing wistfulness of keen, gray sight, as if the man was forever looking for that which he never found. Jane's subtle woman's intuition, even in that brief instant, felt a sadness, a hungering, a secret.|$|E
60|$|Some dozen Bedouin spearmen, Mikahil of a {{neighbouring}} kraal, squatted like {{a line of}} crows {{upon the}} shore to receive us as we waded from the vessel. They demanded money in too authoritative a tone before allowing us to visit the wells, which form their principal wealth. Resolved not to risk a quarrel so near Berberah, I was returning to moralise upon the fate of Burckhardt--after a successful pilgrimage refused admittance to Aaron's tomb at Sinai--when a Bedouin ran {{to tell us that}} we might wander where we pleased. He excused himself and his companions by pleading necessity, and his <b>leanness</b> lent conviction to the plea.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sometimes, {{in small}} places like Waihee, {{the path of}} his journey was marked {{afterward}} by <b>leanness</b> and famine. But a king must be fed, {{and it is not}} good to anger a king. So, like warning in advance of disaster, Waihee heard of his coming, and all food- getters of field and pond and mountain and sea were busied with getting food for the feast. And behold, everything was got, from the choicest of royal taro to sugar-cane joints for the roasting, from opihis to limu, from fowl to wild pig and poi-fed puppies-- everything save one thing. The fishermen failed to get lobsters.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the man on}} {{the plank}} above turned round, and Deringham felt {{inclined}} to gasp as he stood {{face to face with the}} new heir to Carnaby. The man was grimed with dust and ashes. His blue shirt rolled back to the shoulders left uncovered arms that were corded like a smith's, and was rent at the neck so that Deringham could see the finely-arched chest. The overalls, tight-belted round the waist, set off the solidity of his shoulders and the <b>leanness</b> of the flank, while with the first glance at his face Deringham recognized the teamster who had driven them through the bush.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ye don't say!" [...] His lordship was {{slightly}} {{moved out of}} an imperturbability that he had studiously cultivated. He {{was a young man}} of perhaps eight-and-twenty, well above the middle height in stature and appearing taller by virtue of his exceeding <b>leanness.</b> He had a thin, pale, rather pleasing hatchet-face, framed in the curls of a golden periwig, a sensitive mouth and pale blue eyes that lent his countenance a dreamy expression, a rather melancholy pensiveness. But they were alert, observant eyes notwithstanding, although they failed on this occasion to observe the slight change of colour which his question had brought to Miss Bishop's cheeks or the suspiciously excessive composure of her answer.|$|E
