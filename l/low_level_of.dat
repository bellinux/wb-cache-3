5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome depends on findings such as rapid development of muscle paralysis, absent reflexes, absence of fever, and a likely cause. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis (through a lumbar spinal puncture) and nerve conduction studies are supportive investigations commonly {{performed in the}} {{diagnosis of}} GBS. Testing for antiganglioside antibodies is often performed, but their contribution to diagnosis is usually limited. Blood tests are generally performed to exclude the possibility of another cause for weakness, such as a <b>low</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> potassium in the blood. An abnormally <b>low</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> sodium in the blood is often encountered in Guillain–Barré syndrome.

5|$|Both {{environmental}} factors and genetics {{are associated with}} alcoholism with about half the risk attributed to each. A person with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is {{three to four times}} more likely to be alcoholic themselves. Environmental factors include social, cultural, and behavioral influences.

A <b>low</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> withdrawal may last for months following stopping. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a physical and mental illness. Both questionnaires and certain blood tests may detect people with possible alcoholism. Further information is then collected to confirm the diagnosis.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the prevalence and {{factors associated with}} <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> lumbar strength in adolescents. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study involving 601 adolescents, aged 14 to 17 years, enrolled in {{public schools in the}} western region of Santa Catarina State - Southern Brazil. Lumbar strength was analyzed by the lumbar extension test developed by the Canadian Society of Exercise Physiology, which proposes different cutoffs for boys and girls. Independent variables were sex, age, socioeconomic status, dietary habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aerobic fitness. For data analysis, univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used, with significance <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 5 %. RESULTS: The prevalence <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> lumbar strength was 27. 3 %. The population subgroups most likely to present <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> lumbar strength were females (OR: 1. 54, 95 % CI : 1. 06 to 2. 23), adolescents with <b>low</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> aerobic fitness (OR: 2. 10, 95 % CI: 1. 41 to 3. 11) and the overweight (OR: 2. 28, 95 % CI: 1. 35 to 3. 81).

The tax revenue from financial services, which was conservatively estimated at 13.9% of UK tax income in 2007, fell alarmingly as the crisis affected bank profits. This contributed to a significant rise in the deficit to an estimated £175billion (12.4% of GDP) in 2009–10 and {{a rise in the}} national debt to above 80% of GDP at its peak.

Several other hormonal deficiencies may develop in the subacute phase. 50% have a deficiency in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), leading to undersecretion of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland and characteristic symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. 75% develop a deficiency to gonadotropins (LH and FSH), which control the reproductive hormone glands. This leads to a disrupted menstrual cycle, infertility and decreased libido.|$|E

Operationally, Alex was not classified as a subtropical storm until late on January13.|$|E
