60|$|Of course. There are one or {{two things}} I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about.|$|E
60|$|MINNIE (gazing at him; after a moment). Sure! I guess I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Madame de Melbain would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{for a few}} moments," [...] {{she said}} quietly. [...] "Afterwards will you come on to the terrace?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I couldn't induce him," [...] said Mrs. Miller very gently. [...] "He wants <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the waiter. He <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> that waiter." ...|$|R
30|$|I can {{understand}} why students don’t {{want to be called}} on personally, and I'm pretty uncomfortable calling students by name in a class environment. But I think it’s important because unless I am calling on everyone, the conversation usually degrades to two or three people who <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me or <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the class. So getting multiple people talking in the class is an essential goal for me and right now that's one of my best tools to accomplish that.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{you don't}} mind, Mrs Clinton, I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> your doctor alone about the case. You can {{wait in the}} next room.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It is {{certainly}} plain enough," [...] I replied, [...] "but I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> before {{you decide to}} hand {{him over to the}} authorities." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have often}} thought that I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> again," [...] she said, immediately. [...] "It seems {{strange to me}} how many things I said to you." ...|$|E
60|$|Foster <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{strangers and}} as the girl had not rebuffed him, he took her cloak, which looked very wet, from the rack.|$|R
6000|$|... "But wouldn't you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{him some}} more?" [...] I suggested; [...] "I {{can see you}} any time about this little {{business}} of ours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Drop {{in on me}} sometime," [...] he said, [...] "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you--Hodder heard a {{voice behind}} him, and turned. A servant was {{standing}} there.|$|R

6000|$|... "Telephone me," [...] said Mr. Crewe, [...] "and if I can get off, I will. I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> You {{have more}} sense than most women I know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They drink, {{and they}} don't mind as they should." [...] Captain Marshall turned to Phil. [...] "After breakfast, I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> on {{business}} in the cabin," [...] he added.|$|E
6000|$|On {{returning}} to the waiting-room, he addressed a characteristic question to the assembled visitors. [...] "More humbug?" [...] asked the gentleman who <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> a pretty woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, is that Earl Portney?" [...] {{came from}} within, and both Earl and Randy {{recognized}} Jasper Guardley's voice. [...] "If it is, I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him." ...|$|R
50|$|The pair {{look around}} Barcelona and John takes {{photographs}} of Brian. They discuss, among other things, John’s relationship with Cynthia, {{which he does}} not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Brian about.|$|R
6000|$|... "My news is bad news, sir," [...] Strong answered; [...] "it {{concerns}} {{our friends}} at Tunbridge Wells, and I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about it. Clavering {{is at his}} old tricks again, Major Pendennis." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] she said. [...] "Only I feel I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> for {{a little}} time, if you don't mind. It's nothing very much," [...] she continued, nervously {{twisting}} her handkerchief between her fingers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mind}} walking?" [...] the Prime Minister said. [...] "There {{is another matter}} I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about, and there's nowhere better than the streets for a little conversation. Besides, I need the air." ...|$|E

6000|$|He sighed {{a little}} wistfully. [...] "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you," [...] he said simply, [...] "but somehow to-night... {{you know it}} was much easier when you were a {{journalist}} from the 'Hour'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes when I hain't busy, I {{drop into}} the state library at the capital and enjoy myself. It's like goin' to another world without any folks to bother you. Er--er--there's books I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about--sometime." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you're ever in New York, Erwin," [...] said he, [...] "look me up Dallam and Spence. We're {{members of}} the Exchange, so you won't have any trouble in finding us. I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{sometime}} about the West." ...|$|E
6000|$|From {{your letter}} {{you seem to}} have taken an active feeling, to say the least, in this matter, that I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about. I could write, but do not want to do so. Why not come down here and see me? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> that man," [...] said Chet, and {{watching}} his chance, {{he called to}} the individual. The fellow called back, and when his work was ended, {{walked over to the}} boys.|$|R
6000|$|... "A little amateurish," [...] {{said the}} Curate from Iping Hanger to Mr Rathbone-Slater. [...] "A great gift, undoubtedly, but a certain lack of {{sustained}} training. There were {{one or two}} little things ... I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Kipps {{spoke of}} his respect for Miss Walshingham and her {{freckled}} friend. He contrived not to look too self-conscious. [...] "You know, I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> people <b>like</b> that, but I can't. A chap's afraid of giving himself away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It don't matter," [...] said Delano. [...] "Suppose {{you walk}} up to my hotel with me. I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Your {{footwork}} is the worst I ever saw, Madigan--but--well, I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> You may not think so, but I'm not so stuck up. I came off of the West Side myself. That overcoat cost me eight hundred dollars; but the collar ain't so high but what I can see over it. I taught myself to dance, and I put in most of nine years at it before I shook a foot in public. But I had genius. I didn't go too far wrong in teaching myself as you've done. You've got the rottenest method and style of anybody I ever saw." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some day," [...] she said, presently, [...] "I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> of Theos. I {{believe that}} before long {{there will be}} great changes here.

6000|$|The {{tears came}} to the girl's eyes. [...] "I do believe you know best, Mary," [...] she said, in a distressed voice. [...] "Oh, please don't think that I am cross. I am so glad you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|R
60|$|The bishop {{thought he}} would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> those two {{ordination}} candidates, but they prevailed upon him not to do so. He lay for {{the best part of}} one night confiding remarkable things to two imaginary ordination candidates.|$|R
5000|$|Adriano Ramos (Konstantino Atan): He {{has very}} crazy dreams, which make him sleep during class time. In his room, he <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> an old sock, named Chulé (Portuguese word for [...] "stinky feet"), and a chair name Senhor Cadeirudo ...|$|R
