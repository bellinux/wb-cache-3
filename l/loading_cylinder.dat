40|$|The {{buckling}} strength of axially loaded cylindrical shells is greatly affected by geometric imperfections. Due {{to the difference}} between test results and classical theory solution, current codes of practice require the application of knockdown factors to the classical buckling load. Another approach is to conduct a rigorous analysis incorporating geometric and material imperfections. However, the shape of imperfections that result in the minimum buckling load is questionable. In this work, the effect of random geometric imperfections on the {{buckling strength}} of axially <b>loaded</b> <b>cylinders</b> was investigated using the finite element method. Geometric imperfections were modeled by a series of cosine functions with various deterministic and random variables. The imperfection profile was fully characterized by the power spectral density function of the random process which was established by assuming a decaying cosine autocorrelation function. A large number of artificial cylinder samples was generated and grouped into five groups according to the geometric imperfection configuration. Elastic and inelastic buckling analyses results were compared to published test results and to the results obtained using the ASME Code Case N- 284. Statistical analysis of the finite element results was accomplished using the Analysis of Variance technique to determine the worst imperfection configuration. On the basis of the statistical study, axisymmetric imperfections were found to be the worst imperfections for axially <b>loaded</b> <b>cylinders.</b> These results were used to establish an equivalent axisymmetric imperfection that can be easily implemented in the analysis of axially <b>loaded</b> <b>cylinders...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Poynting effect, {{in which}} a {{cylinder}} elongates or contracts axially under torsion, is an important nonlinear phenomenon in soft materials. In this paper, analytical solutions are obtained for homogeneous and bi-layered cylinders under torsion, axial and combined loadings, employing second-order elasticity and Lagrangian equilibrium equations. Explicit parameters for judging {{the sign of the}} Poynting effect are given. It is found that the effect in a soft composite may be significantly amplified over that in homogeneous materials and that it is strongly influenced by the interface position and by the material configuration in the composite. A coupled axial force–twist effect under combined loading, i. e., the twist of a torsionally <b>loaded</b> <b>cylinder</b> can be affected by the axial loading, is also found. Comparison of the predictions with the torque-tension-twist data for cardiac papillary muscles shows reasonable agreement.

This model utilized an implantable hydraulic device incorporating five <b>loading</b> <b>cylinders</b> and platens in {{direct contact with}} an exposed plane of trabecular bone.

The trabecular remodeling response is measured using serial in vivo computed tomography, in vitro microcomputed tomography, and histologic analysis. The results of the experiment indicate that significant remodeling can be induced by the activated implant. An increase in trabecular orientation toward the loaded platens was observed, and a statistically significant decrease in connectivity was documented. The greatest effect was associated with a change in the loading rate.

40|$|Among the {{alternative}} fuels, hydrogen shows great {{potential in the}} near future. In the present study, hydrogen utilization as diesel engine fuel was investigated. Hydrogen {{can not be used}} directly in a diesel engine due to its autoignition temperature higher than that of diesel fuel. One alternative method is to use hydrogen in enrichment or induction. To investigate the combustion characteristics of this dual fuel engine, a single cylinder diesel research engine was converted to utilize hydrogen as fuel. Hydrogen was introduced to the intake manifold using a mixer before entering the combustion chamber. The engine was run at a constant speed of 2000 rpm and variable loads. At each load step the flow rate of hydrogen was varied. Fuel consumption, injector needle lift movement, and cylinder pressure were measured. Introducing hydrogen to the combustion chamber reduced the diesel fuel consumption. Indicated efficiency slightly increases with hydrogen enrichment at 15 Nm load. At lower load the efficiency decreases. Specific energy consumption increases with increase in hydrogen flow rate at 5 and 10 Nm load.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between heat and dynamic response of viscoelastic bodies with tempera-ture-dependent properties is studied. First, equations governing the small deformation thermomechanical response to sinusoidal loading are {{shown to be}} equivalent {{to a set of}} two variational principles. Viscoelastic properties of a solid propellant are characterized and then used in numerical examples dealing with sinusoidal shear loading of slabs and cylinders. As the first problem, an approximate variational method is used to calculate one-dimensional transient and steady-state temperature distributions in a massless slab. An exact steady-state solution is obtained for the thermomechanical behavior of a slab with concentrated mass and is then used to deduce the solution for a similarly <b>loaded</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Finally, the influence of distributed mass in a cylinder is studied using a variational method. It is found that without inertia a large temperature rise may occur when the applied stress amplitude is above a certain critical value which depends on thermal and mechanical properties, geometry, and frequency.
