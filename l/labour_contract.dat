40|$|Not only {{is there}} an {{increase}} in the use of contract workers in some of today’s workplaces, but a qualitative shift has also taken place in the nature of <b>labour</b> <b>contracting,</b> as the operation of labour intermediaries has expanded from peripheral services to the main production activities of companies. This new phenomenon implies the greater integration of <b>labour</b> <b>contracting</b> into the production process, together with changes in employment practices and the rights of workers. This thesis aims to better understand how the changing nature of <b>labour</b> <b>contracting</b> affects employment relationships by undertaking an empirical investigation of in-house contracting arrangements in the South Korean automobile industry. In so doing, it examines roles and relationships between workplace actors involved in labour contracting; namely, user firm management, contractors, labour organisations, user firm employees, contract workers and the state. This analysis sheds light on the process of change in <b>labour</b> <b>contracting</b> and the consequences of increased <b>labour</b> <b>contracting</b> in the workplace. The thesis argues that the coordination of workplace changes brought about by increased flexibility attained through the use of contract workers is fraught with tension, which influences the ways in which employment relationships are shaped in the context of any particular firm. The essence of such tension lies in the pursuit of organisational flexibility and quality control in the production process, both of which are considered to be necessary to ensuring the performance of firms. Contradictions arise from the attempts of user firms to avoid employment-related responsibility for the labour force, {{while at the same time}} exerting managerial control over contract workers. Such tensions and paradoxes are associated with conflicts of interest, and compromise between and within workplace actors. A case study of the Korean automobile industry is provided that explores the contradictory nature of the <b>labour</b> <b>contracting</b> system, as contract workers with fewer employment entitlements are brought into core production processes; and investigates the manner in which inherent tensions play out in shaping employment relationships and the orientation of <b>labour</b> <b>contracting</b> practices. The findings of this thesis could help in the further understanding of the implications of change in <b>labour</b> <b>contracting</b> practices, and contribute to overcoming the current limits of thinking with regard to labour flexibility and employment relationships in the context of in-house contracting...|$|R

Thus, the very foundation of capitalist wealth creation involves – as Marx says explicitly – a [...] "mask".

40|$|Purpose: To ease {{adjustments}} in the labour market, many countries have softened their legislation since the 1970 s by introducing flexible <b>labour</b> <b>contracts</b> or by making their use easier. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to document labour management of temporary contracts during the last 20 years in Belgium, compared to the situation in its neighbouring countries. The authors investigate the determinants of the use of flexible <b>labour</b> <b>contracts</b> and the consequences of their introduction on labour dynamics. Design/methodology/approach: A dynamic Probit is considered to model the use of fixed term <b>labour</b> <b>contracts</b> (FTCs) and standard dynamic labour demand equations are used to test the impact of <b>labour</b> <b>contracts</b> on the <b>labour</b> adjustment at the firm level, using a panel of around 8, 000 firms during the period 1998 - 2005. Findings: The results indicate that some firms follow labour management based on a core (indefinite term contracts - ITCs) and a peripheral component (FTCs) and manage temporary contracts on a "permanent" basis, from a long run perspective. Estimates also confirm a much faster temporary contracts employment adjustment, while ITCs adjustment does not depend on whether firms employ FTCs. ITCs short-term employment elasticity with respect to wages suggests that workers protection against redundancies is strengthened when firms manage work organisation with both types of contracts. In contrast to ITCs, FTCs are used to meet unexpected demand shocks. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the growing literature on the impact of the introduction of new flexible <b>contracts</b> on the <b>labour</b> demand at the firm level. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.
