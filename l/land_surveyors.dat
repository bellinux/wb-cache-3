25|$|The Practice Advisory Department (PAD) is a {{division}} of the ABCLS which exists to promote the professional competency of <b>land</b> <b>surveyors,</b> which in turn protects the public interest. The protection of the public interest is of the utmost importance to the ABCLS, as framed in the Association's Mission Statement (see above). The PAD strives to monitor the competence level of the ABCLS membership while considering the expectations of the public, government, and ABCLS members. The PAD aims to ensure that all land surveys completed in British Columbia meet a high quality of standards, and that the overall integrity of the province's cadastre is maintained. In order to achieve these goals, the PAD initiated the Practice Review Program, which consists of two primary activities: an Annual Plan Review and a Practice Review.|$|E

25|$|On January 7, 2010, local villagers were {{involved}} in a mass altercation during a protest against <b>land</b> <b>surveyors</b> who were surveying local farmland for development projects. The violence resulted in the death of one villager and the serious injury of another. Various city officials passed by the scene of the violence but reportedly did not intervene, and did not further address the issue. Both Li Lianyu and the mayor (second highest official) of Pizhou were removed from office {{as a result of the}} fallout from the scandal. Li, however, retained his position as Vice-Mayor of Xuzhou; his dismissal, in practice, meant that he would become a 'full-time' vice mayor working in Xuzhou. On April 11, a crowd that had earlier caught wind of Li's departure gathered at Li's office in an attempt to prevent him from leaving. The crowd consisted mainly of transient city contractors who were promised permanent positions in return for the city government's planned privatization of a formerly state-owned enterprise. They feared that if Li were to depart without bringing the matter to a close, they would soon lose their jobs and livelihoods. Li was able to get past the crowd and departed for Xuzhou shortly thereafter.|$|E
