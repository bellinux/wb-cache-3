30|$|The {{temperature}} {{difference between the}} lens and the <b>lens</b> <b>holder</b> was verified in the heating scenario by using the proto model of LIR in an air environment in the laboratory. In order to measure the actual lens temperature, thermocouples were put directly {{on the center of}} the Ge lens and the <b>lens</b> <b>holder</b> where temperature for the telemetry is measured. A sheet heater was placed in front of the lens in Fig.  8 to simulate infrared radiation from the baffle, and it was heated from 300 to 320  K. When the temperature of the heater attained a maximum of 320  K, the temperature of the Ge lens, which was initially equivalent to that of the <b>lens</b> <b>holder,</b> became ~  0.6  K higher than that of the <b>lens</b> <b>holder.</b> Temperature of the Ge lens on orbit also must become higher than that of the <b>lens</b> <b>holder</b> monitored by the thermal sensor when the baffle is temporarily heated by solar radiation.

40|$|Immersion is the {{ultimate}} goal of head-mounted displays (HMD) for Virtual Reality (VR) in order to produce a convincing user expe-rience. Two important aspects in this context are motion sickness, often due to imprecise calibration, and the integration of a reliable eye tracking. We propose an affordable hard- and software solution for drift-free eye-tracking and user-friendly lens calibration within an HMD. The use of dichroic mirrors leads to a lean design that provides the full field-of-view (FOV) while using commodity cam-eras for eye tracking.

40|$|This study {{presents}} design, digital {{implementation and}} performance validation of a lead-lag controller for a 2 -degree-of-freedom (DOF) translational optical image stabilizer (OIS) installed {{with a digital}} image sensor in mobile camera phones. Nowadays, OIS is an important feature of modern commercial mobile camera phones, which aims to mechanically reduce the image blur caused by hand shaking while shooting photos. The OIS developed {{in this study is}} able to move the imaging lens by actuating its voice coil motors (VCMs) at the required speed to the position that significantly compensates for imaging blurs by hand shaking. The compensation proposed is made possible by first establishing the exact, nonlinear equations of motion (EOMs) for the OIS, which is followed by designing a simple lead-lag controller based on established nonlinear EOMs for simple digital computation via a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) board in order to achieve fast response. Finally, experimental validation is conducted to show the favorable performance of the designed OIS; i. e., it is able to stabilize the <b>lens</b> <b>holder</b> to the desired position within 0. 02 s, which is much less than previously reported times of around 0. 1 s.

50|$|Motivated by {{a strong}} sense of {{simplicity}} in equipment and technique learned from Edward Weston, and reinforced by his readings of Robinson Jeffers' sparse poetry for which he had sincere admiration, Baer reduced his photographic equipment to a compact minimum. With time and experience, he acquired the equipment and techniques that completely suited his photographic style. Once he had settled on a particular technique he rarely changed it. Baer used the same Ansco 8x10S view camera on an apparently flimsy but really very sturdy wood tripod for virtually all his serious photography. After fifty years of usage the Ansco had become almost an extension of his mind and eye; he could adjust its settings by feel alone while under his darkcloth and concentrating on his subject in the ground glass viewer.

40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} {{the rates of}} microbial contamination of solutions and lens accessories of existing ortho-k lens wearers and the effect on contamination rates of monthly replacement and warnings. To investigate self-reported levels of compliance with care of the lenses and lens accessories and correlation of these levels with the rates of microbial contamination. Methods. Asymptomatic ortho-k lens wearers with at least 6 -month successful use were requested to bring their lenses, solutions, and accessories to their next aftercare visit. All items, except the lenses, were replaced at each data collection visit. Samples collected from the lens surface, solution, and accessories were cultured for pathogens. These procedures were repeated twice at 1 -month intervals. At the first visit, each subject and/or parent was interviewed about the care/use of the lens and accessories. Results. Thirty-eight subjects completed the study. Initial contamination rates of the lenses, lens cases, and tweezers were 29, 34, and 46 %, respectively. Rates of contamination dropped for <b>lenses,</b> suction <b>holders,</b> and tweezers during the three-visit intervention. Contact lens solutions, except lens cleaner were contaminated on all occasions with the most contaminated product being artificial tears [33 % (n = 18) ]. There was no improvement in the contamination rate of the lens cases. The most common pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus and Serratia marcescens. Compliance was lowest for care of lens cases and highest for care of lenses. However, correlation between reported compliance and presence of pathogens failed to reach significance. Conclusions. Subjects' awareness {{of the importance of}} lens cleanliness is high and can be improved by regular reinforcements. However, attitudes toward cleaning of accessories was far less satisfactory and while replacement and warnings resulted in significant improvements of contamination rates of tweezers and suction holders, more emphasis should be placed on educating patients on correct care of lens accessories.
