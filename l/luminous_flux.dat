25|$|Bicycle {{lighting}} is illumination attached to bicycles whose purpose above all is, along with reflectors, {{to improve the}} visibility of the bicycle and its rider to other road users under circumstances of poor ambient illumination. A secondary purpose is to illuminate reflective materials such as cat's eyes and traffic signs. A third purpose may be to illuminate the roadway so that the rider can see the way ahead. Serving the latter purposes require much more <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> and thus more power.|$|E
25|$|Dirt buildup on {{headlamp}} lenses increases glare {{to other}} road users, even at levels {{too low to}} reduce seeing performance significantly for the driver. Therefore, headlamp lens cleaners are required by UN Regulation 48 on vehicles equipped with low-beam headlamps using light sources that have a reference <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> of 2,000 lumens or more. This includes all HID headlamps and some high-power halogen units. Some cars have lens cleaners fitted even where the regulations do not require them.

40|$|The use of photomultipliers {{has given}} the {{possibility}} of accurate measurements of <b>luminous</b> <b>fluxes</b> of low intensity. The recommended methods for reducing light intensities in a given way are now susceptible of rigid and thorough control. Several methods have been compared in this way and the working conditions {{of the most promising}} one, the method of rotating gauzes (grillages tournants) have been investigated. Under normal conditions the grids do not show an optically neutral behaviour: diffraction phenomena causing a reduction of the light generally increasing with increasing wave-length. Working conditions to eliminate this inconvenience in using the gauzes could be found. © 1956 Pergamon Press Ltd. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

Lumens per watt is a common measure of the efficacy of a light source. [...] The <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> is of less value for bicycle lighting due to the importance of directionality.

40|$|General {{lighting}} {{by use of}} LED-Chips {{is one of the}} strongly growing markets {{today and}} also in future. One of the trends goes to LEDs with higher and higher <b>luminous</b> <b>fluxes</b> per chip area to get the best price per lumen on the market. Unfortunately, such large LEDs produce a lot of heat, which must be spread to avoid overheating and shorter lifetime of the LEDs. Another approach is the use of many small LEDs so that both light and heat source are spread into a larger area. Cost-effective established PCB-technology was applied to produce large-area light sources consisting of many small LED chips placed and electrically connected on a PCB-substrate. LEDs were ICA-bonded with their bottom pad to the PCB. The top contacts of the LEDs were established by laminating an adhesive copper sheet followed by a LDI structuring as known from PCB-via-technology. This assembly can then be completed by adding converting and light forming optical elements...|$|R
40|$|We {{conduct a}} {{thorough}} study of photometric stereo under nearby point light source illumination, from modeling to numerical solution, through calibration. In the classical formulation of photometric stereo, the <b>luminous</b> <b>fluxes</b> {{are assumed to}} be directional, which is very difficult to achieve in practice. Rather, we use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to illuminate the scene to reconstruct. Such point light sources are very convenient to use, yet they yield a more complex photometric stereo model which is arduous to solve. We first derive in a physically sound manner this model, and show how to calibrate its parameters. Then, we discuss two state-of-the-art numerical solutions. The first one alternatingly estimates the albedo and the normals, and then integrates the normals into a depth map. It is shown empirically to be independent from the initialization, but convergence of this sequential approach is not established. The second one directly recovers the depth, by formulating photometric stereo as a system of PDEs which are partially linearized using image ratios. Although the sequential approach is avoided, initialization matters a lot and convergence is not established either. Therefore, we introduce a provably convergent alternating reweighted least-squares scheme for solving the original system of PDEs, without resorting to image ratios for linearization. Finally, we extend this study to the case of RGB images...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} solar gains through {{transparent}} surfaces {{is the primary}} objective {{in order to reduce}} buildings’ cooling energy needs. Heat and <b>luminous</b> <b>fluxes</b> cannot be modulated only by single glazing; thus, the transparent surfaces are protected by an external shading element with different efficacy grades, in function of the material consistency, morphology, and handling typology. In steel and glass architectures, whose design is often experimental, there is a more and more frequent use of elements characterized by a threedimensional matrix and a multi-directional performances, as for instance expanded metal or perforated metal sheets, micro and geosynthetic fabrics. The objective of this contribution is to determine, for several typologies of materials with 3 D matrix, the optical-energetic behaviour and the correlation between geometry variation and performance, {{as a function of the}} angle of incidence of solar radiation. We selected 3 samples, and we measured their solar transmittance for angles of incidence from near normal to 60 °. Then with numerical simulation we compared their performance and shading efficacy. The analysis carried out shows that solar transmittance does not always decrease with increasing angle of incidence. For the selected samples, the relative positioning of the texture (horizontal or vertical) affects the transmittance values: for angles smaller than 30 ° the samples orientation involves a performance variation up to 18...|$|R
2500|$|Luminous {{efficacy}} {{of a light}} source may be defined in two ways. The radiant luminous efficacy (LER) is {{the ratio of the}} visible light flux emitted (the <b>luminous</b> <b>flux)</b> to the total power radiated over all wavelengths. The source luminous efficacy (LES) is the ratio of the visible light flux emitted (the <b>luminous</b> <b>flux)</b> to the total power input to the source, such as a lamp. Visible light is measured in lumens, a unit which is defined in part by the differing sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths of light. Not all wavelengths of visible electromagnetic energy are equally effective at stimulating the human eye; the luminous {{efficacy of}} radiant energy (LER) is a measure of how well the distribution of energy matches the perception of the eye. The units of luminous efficacy are [...] "lumens per watt" [...] (lpw). The maximum LER possible is 683lm/W for monochromatic green light at 555 nanometers wavelength, the peak sensitivity of the human eye.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{introduction}} in the 1990s, high-frequency ballasts {{have been}} used in general lighting fixtures with either rapid start or pre-heat lamps. These ballasts convert the incoming power to an output frequency in excess of [...] This increases lamp efficiency. These are used in several applications, including new generation tanning lamp systems, whereby a 100 watt lamp (e.g., F71T12BP) can be lit using 90 watts of actual power while obtaining the same <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> (measured in lumens) as magnetic ballasts. [...] These ballasts operate with voltages that can be almost 600 volts, requiring some consideration in housing design, and can cause a minor limitation in the length of the wire leads from the ballast to the lamp ends.|$|E
50|$|The SI unit of <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> is the lumen (lm). One lumen {{is defined}} as the <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> of light {{produced}} by a light source that emits one candela of luminous intensity over a solid angle of one steradian. In other systems of units, <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> may have units of power.|$|E
40|$|Lighting {{very long}} road tunnels implies a high {{consumption}} of electrical energy since {{it requires a}} proper illumination during the whole day. In particular, in the daytime the illuminance levels right at the entrance and exit zones must be higher than those characterizing {{the inside of the}} tunnel, in this way the eye of the driver is able to adapt and be safe while passing from a high natural illumination of the outside to the lighting conditions characterizing the inside of the tunnel; consequently this causes a high energy demand. Therefore this case study investigates whether it is possible to minimize the energy demand through the exertion of an automatic new control system regulating the <b>luminous</b> <b>fluxes</b> of artificial sources (guaranteeing the parameters set by the regulation) with respect to the variation of the natural light characterizing the outside. The innovative control systems must be characterized by high reliability levels in order to guarantee conditions which are not dangerous to the driver if an outage occurs and minimize their maintenance costs. To carry out this type of study the software DIALux was used to simulate a tunnel with a dimming system (with lamps characterized by a high luminous efficiency) regulated by a pre-programmed logic control system (with high MTBF values). The savings obtained enabled the amortization of the solution here suggested in a time interval which makes it an advantageous choice economically speaking...|$|R
40|$|Application of RADIANCE {{simulation}} tool can be {{ranged from}} typical lighting design to {{development of new}} materials. In this presentation, we will show two cases of RADIANCE application for {{the research and development}} of new, future solutions. In the first case, the model development of Virtual Natural Lighting Solutions (VNLS) is shown. A VNLS is expected to mimic the behavior of real window in spaces without actual windows. RADIANCE is employed to predict the lighting performance, i. e. gain of well-lit workplane area, uniformity, ground contribution on the ceiling, and probability of discomfort glare. Various configurations, tilt angles, beam angles, and total <b>luminous</b> <b>fluxes</b> are considered as input variables. The results show a comparison of the indicators with VNLS, relative to those with real windows under CIE overcast sky. In the second case, the measurement and simulation of irradiance distribution on a sample coated with photocatalyst are shown. A certain setting is required to assess the material’s ability to degrade pollutants, and incoming light on the material’s surface {{plays an important role in}} the process. Using the simulation model, more insight was provided into the distribution and the effects of the glass cover and reflection of the sample on the received irradiance, which initially could not be measured. Based on the simulations, the irradiance within the range of 400 - 570 nm on the catalyst sample can be mapped. The simulation results will serve as boundary conditions in further studies for predicting the degradation of pollutants in the reactor...|$|R
40|$|The {{bidirectional}} scatter {{distribution function}} (BSDF) characterizes the scattering properties of a material for any angle of illumination or viewing, and offers {{as such a}} complete description of the spatial optical characteristics of the surface. An accurate determination of the BSDF is important in many scientific domains, such as computer graphics, architectural and lighting design, and the field of material appearance characterization (e. g. the color and gloss properties). Many BSDF measuring instruments {{have been reported in}} the literature. The majority of these instruments are goniometric measurement devices, by use of which the BSDF is determined by scanning all incoming and outgoing light flux directions in sequence. For this, the sample, detector, and/or source perform relative individual movements. In result, the major restriction of this type of instruments constitutes the measurement time, which may run to the order of several hours depending on the accuracy (angular resolution) and the complexity (spectral coverage, absolute measurement capability, etc.) of the reported measurement data. This paper describes the results of a feasibility study, in which an alternative goniometric measurement system is designed, enabling to acquire the photometric BSDF in a full three-dimensional (3 D) space, with a high mechanical angular resolution (0. 1 °) in a time efficient way (about 30 minutes). A near-field goniophotometer, originally intended to measure luminance intensity distributions and <b>luminous</b> <b>fluxes</b> of light sources and luminaires, was converted for this purpose. Besides a discussion of the design and the measurement procedure, test sample measurements are presented to illustrate the versatility of the device. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abridged) We {{introduce}} a novel technique to construct spatially resolved maps of stellar mass surface density in galaxies based on optical and near IR imaging. We use optical/NIR colour(s) to infer effective stellar mass-to-light ratios (M/L) at each pixel, {{which are then}} multiplied by the surface brightness to obtain the local stellar surface mass density. We build look-up tables to express M/L {{as a function of}} colour(s) by marginalizing over a Monte Carlo library of 50, 000 stellar population synthesis (SPS) models by Charlot & Bruzual (2007), which include a revised prescription for the TP-AGB stellar evolutionary phase, {{with a wide range of}} dust exinctions. In order to extract reliable flux and colour information at any position in the galaxy, we perform a median adaptive smoothing of the images that preserves the highest possible spatial resolution. As the most practical and robust, and hence fiducial method, we express the M/L in the H band as a function of (g-i) and (i-H). Stellar mass maps computed in this way have a typical accuracy of 30 per cent or less at any given pixel, determined from the scatter in the models. We compare maps obtained with our fiducial method with those derived using other combinations of bandpasses and the old BC 03 TP-AGB prescription. Finally, we compare total stellar mass estimates obtained by integrating resolved mass maps with those obtained with unresolved photometry. In galaxies with evident dust lanes, unresolved estimates may miss up to 40 per cent of the total stellar mass because dusty regions are strongly under-represented in the <b>luminous</b> <b>fluxes.</b> Comment: Accepted for publication on MNRAS on Aug 10 th 2009. 21 pages, 14 figures (see [URL] for full resolution).

40|$|There exist {{electrostatic}} acceleration regions (accelerator gaps) above the inner {{part of a}} Keplerian accretion disc of an x-ray pulsar which can accelerate positively charged particles (protons/ions) to extreme relativistic energies (>or= 10 15 eV) towards the accretion disc. The subsequent hadronic collisions between such ultrarelativistic protons (ions) and the disc material can produce numerous secondary mesons whose decay generates a <b>luminous</b> neutrino <b>flux.</b> Although the neutrinos can directly escape from the collision regions without any energy loss, the disc magnetic field can modify the neutrino spectrum because their unstable charged parent particles can lose energy via synchrotron radiation. This can provide direct information {{on the structure of}} the accretion disc. In calculating the meson production rate, the authors have used an improved scaling violation model which has the effect of enhancing the neutrino production rate. It appears that a large fraction of the accretion power of x-ray pulsars (approximately 10 37 erg s - 1) could be carried away by the neutrino flux.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in {{light emitting diode}} (LED) technology has resulted in high power, single chip devices that provide <b>luminous</b> radiant <b>fluxes</b> exceeding several watts. Operated in pulsed current mode the instantaneous light emission of an LED can be further increased to levels {{comparable to that of}} photographic (xenon) flash units making it a suitable light source for Schlieren imaging. Compared to the commonly used xenon flash units an LED can be triggered within tens of nanoseconds at rise times on the order of 100 ns thereby enabling stroboscopic illumination at megahertz rates. In the present application the LED's driving electronics were synchronized to a high speed camera to provide time-resolved schlieren images of an underexpanded free jet impinging on a flat plate (nozzle pressure ratio 2. 0 to 5. 2). The LED was pulsed in burst mode for 102 images at currents of up to 120 A at 500 ns per pulse.

40|$|The flux {{of large}} meteoroids {{is not well}} {{determined}} due to relatively low number statistics, due mainly {{to the lack of}} collecting area available to meteor camera systems (10 (2) - 10 (5) km 2). Larger collecting areas are needed to provide reasonable statistics for flux calculations. The Moon, with millions of square kilometers of lunar surface, {{can be used as a}} detector for observing the population of large meteoroids in the tens of grams to kilogram mass range. This is accomplished by observing the flash of light produced when a meteoroid impacts the lunar surface, converting a portion of its kinetic energy to visible light detectable from Earth. A routine monitoring program at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center has recorded over 300 impact flashes since early 2006. The program utilizes multiple 0. 35 m (14 inch) Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes, outfitted with video cameras using the 1 / 2 inch Sony EXview HAD CCDTM chip, to perform simultaneous observations of the earthshine hemisphere of the Moon when the lunar phase is between 0. 1 and 0. 5. This optical arrangement permits monitoring of approximately 3. 8 x 10 (6) km 2 of lunar surface. A selection of 126 flashes recorded in 266. 88 hours of photometric skies was analyzed, creating the largest and most homogeneous dataset of lunar impact flashes to date.
