On GameSpot, a video-game news website, [...] Jason D'Aprile praised Alienation cooperative gameplay but was frustrated {{by the lack of}} a <b>local</b> <b>mode,</b> though he said that [...] "with a full troop online" [...] the game was [...] "easily one of the best all-out action multiplayer games in recent memory". In David Jenkins' review for the British news site Metro, the co-op was [...] "fun no matter what". On USgamer, Jaz Rignall was puzzled about it not being a feature when the game was released, saying that it would be the [...] "perfect game for couch co-op". Although GamesRadar Ben Tyrer enjoyed the game, he also believed that it would benefit from having a [...] "tense, pad-crushing, couch co-op" [...] feature. Game Informer Matt Miller preferred its cooperative gameplay over single-player.|$|E

The {{magnetic}} control adjustable {{characteristics of}} one-dimensional Thue-Morse quasiperiodic structure with nanoparticle magnetic fluid defect <b>local</b> <b>modes</b> are studied {{by using the}} transfer matrix method. First, the physical model of one-dimensional Thue-Morse quasiperiodic structure with nanoparticle magnetic fluid photonic crystal is built. Then, the transmission spectrum of one-dimensional Thue-Morse quasiperiodic structure with nanoparticle magnetic fluid is calculated by transfer matrix method. Finally, the transmission spectrum of magnetic control adjustable characteristics is discussed. The {{results show that the}} wavelength of the defect <b>local</b> <b>modes</b> shift to the long-wave direction with the refractive index of magnetic fluid increasing; The wavelength drift variation increases as the level of the defect <b>local</b> <b>modes</b> at the different level increase; The quality factor decreases with the increase of the refractive index for the defect <b>local</b> <b>modes</b> at the same level...|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} three-pulse, pump-probe {{experiment}} on H- and D- <b>local</b> <b>modes</b> in CaF 2, SrF 2, and BaF 2 using the Dutch free electron laser, FELIX. The 10 -K lifetimes of the H- <b>local</b> <b>modes</b> were measured as 43 +/- 5, 170 +/- 15, and 212 +/- 20 ps for CaF 2, SrF 2, and BaF 2, respectively. For D-, the corresponding 10 -K lifetimes are 3. 8 +/- 0. 5, 10. 5 +/- 0. 5, and 11. 6 +/- 0. 5 ps. Three-phonon anharmonic decay {{accounts for the}} temperature dependence of the H- lifetimes, while two-phonon anharmonic decay is expected {{to apply for the}} D- lifetimes. However, the D- in BaF 2 lifetime is anomalous in requiring the three-phonon decay occasioned by a close resonance of this D- mode with a three-phonon lattice peak.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{concerns}} the non usual case in structural dynamics {{for which a}} complex structure exhibits both the usual global elastic <b>modes</b> and numerous <b>local</b> elastic <b>modes</b> in the low-frequency range. Despite {{the presence of these}} <b>local</b> elastic <b>modes,</b> we are interested in constructing a stochastic reduced-order model using only the global modes and in taking into account the <b>local</b> elastic <b>modes</b> with a probabilistic approach. The "global elastic modes" and the "local elastic modes" are calculated separately using a new formulation solving two generalized eigenvalue problems. The union of these two families constitutes a basis of the admissible space. Then, the reduced-order model is constructed by projection of the dynamical equation on the global elastic modes. The apparent damping generated in this reduced-order model by the power flow of the mechanical energy from the global <b>modes</b> to the <b>local</b> <b>modes</b> is constructed by a statistical approach.

40|$|International audienceThis {{presentation}} {{is devoted to}} the construction of a stochastic reduced- order model for complex beamlike dynamical structures having a high modal density in the low frequency range. In some cases, in the low-frequency, a dynamical structure can exhibit both the global elastic modes (which characterize this low-frequency range) and numerous <b>local</b> elastic <b>modes.</b> This situation appears for complex heterogeneous structures presenting stiff parts and flexible parts. The presence of these flexible parts induces numerous local reasonance in the low frequency range. Furthermore, in this case, the elastic modes cannot be separated into global elastic <b>modes</b> and <b>local</b> elastic <b>modes.</b> Indeed, due to the coupling between global elastic <b>modes</b> and <b>local</b> elastic <b>modes,</b> the deformation of some global elastic <b>modes</b> have <b>local</b> contributions and the deformation of some <b>local</b> elastic <b>modes</b> have global contributions. Then there are no efficient sorting method which could be used to select the elastic modes as global elastic <b>modes</b> or as <b>local</b> elastic <b>modes...</b>|$|R
