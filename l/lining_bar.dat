5000|$|... "Each workman {{carried a}} <b>lining</b> <b>bar,</b> a {{straight}} pry {{bar with a}} sharp end. The thicker bottom end was square-shafted (to fit against the rail) and shaped to a chisel point (to dig down into the gravel underneath the rail); the lighter top end was rounded (for better gripping). When lining track, each man would face one of the rails and work the chisel end of his <b>lining</b> <b>bar</b> down at an angle into the ballast under it. Then all would take a step toward their rail and pull up and forward on their pry bars to lever the track—rails, crossties and all—over and through the ballast." ...|$|E

50|$|Originally, {{the word}} bar {{came from the}} {{vertical}} lines drawn through the staff to mark off metrical units and not the bar-like (i.e., rectangular) dimensions of a typical measure of music. In British English, these vertical <b>lines</b> are called <b>bar,</b> too, but often the term <b>bar</b> <b>line</b> is used {{in order to make}} the distinction clear. A double <b>bar</b> <b>line</b> (or double <b>bar)</b> can consist of two single <b>bar</b> <b>lines</b> drawn close together, separating two sections within a piece, or a <b>bar</b> <b>line</b> followed by a thicker <b>bar</b> <b>line,</b> indicating the end of a piece or movement. Note that double bar refers not to a type of bar (i.e., measure), but to a type of <b>bar</b> <b>line.</b> Another term for the <b>bar</b> <b>line</b> denoting the end of a piece of music is music end.|$|R

40|$|A {{method that}} {{segments}} the audio {{according to the}} position of the <b>bar</b> <b>lines</b> is presented. The method detects musical bars that frequently repeat in different parts of a musical piece by using an audio similarity matrix. The position of each <b>bar</b> <b>line</b> is predicted by using prior information about the position of previous <b>bar</b> <b>lines</b> as well as the estimated bar length. The <b>bar</b> <b>line</b> segmentation method does not depend on the presence of percussive instruments to calculate the bar length. In addition, the alignment of the bars allows moderate tempo deviations...|$|R
50|$|A graph is {{primarily}} used to show relationships among data and portrays values encoded as visual objects (e.g., <b>lines,</b> <b>bars,</b> or points). Numerical values are displayed within an area delineated {{by one or}} more axes. These axes provide scales (quantitative and categorical) used to label and assign values to the visual objects. Many graphs are also referred to as charts.|$|R
50|$|John J. Emery, {{a wealthy}} Cincinnati businessman, {{commissioned}} {{the construction of}} The Turrets, which was completed in 1895. It joined a number of elegant summer houses that <b>lined</b> <b>Bar</b> Harbor's coast, {{many of which were}} destroyed in a devastating fire in 1947. The Turrets stood vacant for many years before its acquisition by the College of the Atlantic in the 1970s.|$|R

50|$|The {{staff is}} read from bottom to {{top and the}} length of a symbol defines the {{duration}} of the movement. Drawing on western music notation, Labanotation uses <b>bar</b> <b>lines</b> to mark the measures and double <b>bar</b> <b>lines</b> at the start and end of the movement score. The starting position of the dancer can be given before the double <b>bar</b> <b>lines</b> {{at the start of the}} score.|$|R

50|$|In {{music with}} a regular meter, bars {{function}} to indicate a periodic accent in the music, regardless of its duration. In music employing mixed meters, <b>bar</b> <b>lines</b> are instead used to indicate the beginning of rhythmic note groups, but this is subject to wide variation: some composers use dashed <b>bar</b> <b>lines,</b> others (including Hugo Distler) have placed <b>bar</b> <b>lines</b> at different places in the different parts to indicate varied groupings from part to part.|$|R
50|$|William Playfair {{is usually}} {{credited}} with inventing the area charts {{as well as}} the <b>line,</b> <b>bar,</b> and pie charts. His book The Commercial and Political Atlas, published in 1786, contained a number of time-series graphs, including Interest of the National Debt from the Revolution and Chart of all the Imports and Exports to and from England from the Year 1700 to 1782 that are often described as the first area charts in history.|$|R
50|$|A {{postmark}} {{should not}} be confused with the killer which are <b>lines,</b> <b>bars,</b> etc. used to cancel a postage stamp. Neither should a postmark be confused with overprints generally, or pre-cancels (stamps that have been cancelled before the envelope or package to which they are affixed is submitted or deposited for acceptance into the mailstream, they most commonly have taken the form of a pre-printed city name on the stamp) specifically, which generally do not indicate a date.|$|R
