60|$|The Malays are now {{nominally}} in a {{state of}} freedom, and certainly are so as far as regards their personal treatment; but in most other points they are considered as slaves. From their discontented state, from the repeated removals from islet to islet, and perhaps also from a little mismanagement, things are not very prosperous. The island has no domestic quadruped excepting the pig, and the main vegetable production is the cocoa-nut. The whole prosperity of the place depends on this tree; the only exports being oil from the nut, and the nuts themselves, which are taken to Singapore and Mauritius, where they are chiefly used, when grated, in making curries. On the cocoa-nut, also, the pigs, which are loaded with fat, almost entirely subsist, as do the ducks and poultry. Even a huge <b>land-crab</b> is furnished by nature with the means to open and feed on this most useful production.|$|E
60|$|And {{so those}} four days were spent; and the men, like schoolboys on a holiday, gave {{themselves}} up to simple merriment, not forgetting, however, {{to wash the}} clothes, take in fresh water, and store up a good supply of such fruit as seemed likely to keep; until, tired with fruitless rambles after gold, which they expected to find in every bush, in spite of Yeo's warnings that none had been heard of on the island, they were fain to lounge about, full-grown babies, picking up shells and sea-fans to take home to their sweethearts, smoking agoutis out of the hollow trees, with shout and laughter, and tormenting every living thing they could come near, till not a <b>land-crab</b> dare look out of his hole, or an armadillo unroll himself, till they were safe out of the bay, and off again to the westward, unconscious pioneers of all the wealth, and commerce, and beauty, and science which has in later centuries made that lovely isle the richest gem of all the tropic seas.|$|E
6000|$|Do you see? Even {{that poor}} groping old <b>land-crab,</b> with his skull full of pulp, had pride. Isn't it wonderful? And more--he had conscience; {{he had a}} sense of right and wrong, such as it was; he was able to find remorse. It looks impossible, it looks incredible, but it is not. I believe that some day it will be found out that peasants are people. Yes, beings in a great many respects like ourselves. And I believe that some day they will find this out, too--and then! Well, then I think they will rise up and demand to be {{regarded}} as part of the race, and that by consequence there will be trouble.

But from the day that I saw old D'Arc the peasant acting and feeling just as I should have acted and felt myself, I have carried the conviction in my heart that our peasants are not merely animals, beasts of burden put here by the good God to produce food and comfort for the [...] "nation," [...] but something more and better. You look incredulous. Well, that is your training; it is the training of everybody; but as for me, I thank that incident for giving me a better light, and I have never forgotten it.|$|E
60|$|We rowed away, {{toward our}} island paradise. But {{instead of going}} {{straight}} home, we turned into a deep cove called Ance Maurice--all coves in the French islands are called Ances--where was something to be seen, {{and not to be}} forgotten again. We grated in, over a shallow bottom of pebbles interspersed with gray lumps of coral pulp, and of Botrylli, azure, crimson, and all the hues of the flower-garden; and landed on the bank of a mangrove swamp, bored everywhere with the holes of <b>land-crabs.</b> One glance showed how these swamps are formed: by that want of tide which is the curse of the West Indies.|$|R

No light pierced the forest, and the feeble beam of Kit's lantern scarcely touched the shadowy trunks that moved past until they came to an opening. Kit thought this was the spot {{he had been told}} about and turned the boat. She would not float to the bank and he and his four men got out and lifted the coffin. They sank in treacherous mud, but reached a belt of sand riddled by <b>land-crab's</b> holes. All was very quiet except for the ripple of the tide and the noise made by the scuttling crabs. The sand, however, was dry and warm and they sat down to wait for morning when the boat went away.|$|R
60|$|Extreme {{cases of}} {{terrestrial}} animals, once aquatic in habits, throw {{a flood of}} lurid light (as the newspapers say) upon the reason why this should be so. For example, frogs and toads develop from tadpoles, which in all essentials are true gill-breathing fish. It is, therefore, obvious that they cannot lay their eggs on dry land, where the tadpoles {{would be unable to}} find anything to breathe; so that even the driest and most tree-haunting toads must needs repair to the water once a year to deposit their spawn in its native surroundings. Once more, crabs pass their earlier larval stages as free-swimming crustaceans, somewhat shrimp-like in appearance, and as agile as fleas: it is only by gradual metamorphosis that they acquire their legs and claws and heavy pedestrian habits. Now there are certain kinds of crab, like the West Indian <b>land-crabs</b> (those dainty morsels whose image every epicure who has visited the Antilles still enshrines with regret in a warm corner of his heart), which have taken in adult life to walking bodily on shore, and visiting the summits of the highest mountains, like the fish of Deucalion's deluge in Horace. But once a year, as the <b>land-crabs</b> bask in the sun on St. Catherine's Peak or the Fern Walk, a strange instinctive longing comes over them automatically to return for a while to their native element; and, obedient to that inner monitor of their race, down they march in thousands, velut agmine facto, to lay their eggs at their leisure in Port Royal harbour. On the way, the negroes catch them, all full of rich coral, waiting to be spawned; and Chloe or Dinah, serves them up hot, with breadcrumbs, in their own red shells, neatly nestling between the folds of a nice white napkin. The rest run away, and deposit their eggs in the sea, where the young hatch out, and pass their larval stage once more as free and active little swimming crustaceans.|$|R
60|$|Thirdly, {{that those}} which {{they call the}} eyes of Crabs, Lobsters, Shrimps, and the like, and are really so, are Hemispher'd, almost {{in the same manner}} as these of Flies are. And that they really are so, I have very often try'd, by cutting off these little movable knobs, and putting the {{creature}} again into the water, that it would swim to and fro, and move up and down as well as before, but would often hit it self against the rocks or stones; and though I put my hand just before its head, it would not at all start or fly back till I touch'd it, whereas whil'st those were remaining, it would start back, and avoid my hand or a stick at a good distance before it touch'd it. And if in crustaceous Sea-animals, then it seems very probable also, that these knobs are the eyes in crustaceous Insects, which are also of the same kind, onely in a higher and more active Element; this the conformity or congruity of many other parts common to either of them, will strongly argue, their crustaceous armour, their number of leggs, which are six, beside the two great claws, which answer to the wings in Insects; and in all kind of Spiders, as also in many other Insects that want wings, we shall find the compleat number of them, and not onely the number, but the very shape, figure, joints, and claws of Lobsters and Crabs, as is evident in Scorpions and Spiders, as is visible in the second Figure of the 31. Scheme, and in the little Mite-worm, which I call a <b>Land-crab,</b> describ'd in the second Figure of the 33. Scheme, but in their manner of generation being oviparous, &c. And it were very worthy observation, whether there be not some kinds of transformation and metamorphosis in the several states of crustaceous water-animals, as there is in several sorts of Insects; for if such could be met with, the progress of the variations would be much more conspicuous in those larger Animals, then they can be in any kind of Insects our colder Climate affords.|$|E
6000|$|Early {{one summer}} morning I {{had left the}} shores of the Connecticut, and for the livelong day {{travelled}} up the bank of a river, which came in from the west; now looking down on the stream, foaming and rippling through the forest a mile off, from the hills over which the road led, and now sitting on its rocky brink and dipping my feet in its rapids, or bathing adventurously in mid-channel. The hills grew more and more frequent, and gradually swelled into mountains as I advanced, hemming {{in the course of the}} river, so that at last I could not see where it came from, and was at liberty to imagine the most wonderful meanderings and descents. At noon I slept on the grass in the shade of a maple, where the river had found a broader channel than usual, and was spread out shallow, with frequent sand-bars exposed. In the names of the towns I recognized some which I had long ago read on teamsters' wagons, that had come from far up country; quiet, uplandish towns, of mountainous fame. I walked along, musing and enchanted, by rows of sugar-maples, through the small and uninquisitive villages, and sometimes was pleased with the sight of a boat drawn up on a sand-bar, where there appeared no inhabitants to use it. It seemed, however, as essential to the river as a fish, and to lend a certain dignity to it. It was like the trout of mountain streams to the fishes of the sea, or like the young of the <b>land-crab</b> born far in the interior, who have never yet heard the sound of the ocean's surf. The hills approached nearer and nearer to the stream, until at last they closed behind me, and I found myself just before nightfall in a romantic and retired valley, about half a mile in length, and barely wide enough for the stream at its bottom. I thought that there could be no finer site for a cottage among mountains. You could anywhere run across the stream on the rocks, and its constant murmuring would quiet the passions of mankind forever. Suddenly the road, which seemed aiming for the mountain-side, turned short to the left, and another valley opened, concealing the former, and of the same character with it. It was the most remarkable and pleasing scenery I had ever seen. I found here a few mild and hospitable inhabitants, who, as the day was not quite spent, and I was anxious to improve the light, directed me four or five miles farther on my way to the dwelling of a man whose name was Rice, who occupied the last and highest of the valleys that lay in my path, and who, they said, was a rather rude and uncivil man.

5000|$|Born not Drake, but Ethel McGlinchy, the actress's Irish father, a caterer, was {{an actor}} manqué, whose great love was the theatre {{and who was}} given to quoting Shakespeare. She passed an {{entrance}} test to the Academy of Dramatic Art (later to become RADA), in December 1913 - a small class existed at that time for {{children between the ages}} of ten and sixteen who attended only in the afternoons but who had an identical adult curriculum with that of senior students. (It was the high-ups at the ADA who decided McGlinchy was too difficult to pronounce and too hard to remember for a stage name so she changed it, ultimately by deed-poll, to Drake which was the second of her father's Christian names and to Fabia which was the second of her baptismal names, chosen because she was born on St Fabian's Day). Founded by Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, her contemporaries at the Academy of Dramatic Art included the actress Meggie Albanesi, Eva Le Gallienne, and Miles Malleson - a senior student who wrote plays for her. She was small, was called the Shrimp, and played a very wide range of parts - Richard II, Macbeth, Cardinal Richelieu in Bulwer Lytton's play, the Shaughraun in Dion Boucicault's The Shaughraun.

60|$|Near this coast nothing grows; farther inland an {{occasional}} green castor-oil plant, {{and a few}} grasshoppers, true friends of the desert, may be met with. Some grass is scattered {{over the surface of}} the central elevated region, and the whole much resembles the worse parts of the Welsh mountains. But, scanty as the pasture appears, about six hundred sheep, many goats, a few cows and horses, all thrive well on it. Of native animals, <b>land-crabs</b> and rats swarm in numbers. Whether the rat is really indigenous may well be doubted; there are two varieties as described by Mr. Waterhouse; one is of a black colour, with fine glossy fur, and lives on the grassy summit, the other is brown-coloured and less glossy, with longer hairs, and lives near the settlement on the coast. Both these varieties are one-third smaller than the common black rat (M. rattus); and they differ from it both in the colour and character of their fur, but in no other essential respect. I can hardly doubt that these rats (like the common mouse, which has also run wild) have been imported, and, as at the Galapagos, have varied from the effect of the new conditions to which they have been exposed: hence the variety on the summit of the island differs from that on the coast. Of native birds there are none; but the guinea-fowl, imported from the Cape de Verd Islands, is abundant, and the common fowl has likewise run wild. Some cats which were originally turned out to destroy the rats and mice, have increased, so as to become a great plague. The island is entirely without trees, in which, and in every other respect, it is very far inferior to St. Helena.|$|R
5000|$|The ship left London, under Captain Swanson, on 28 August 1865 and Plymouth on 2 September 1865, with {{passengers}} and cargo for Sydney. On 7 October 1865 she was wrecked on the reef Las Roccas , {{on the coast}} of Brazil. She struck about 20:30. The Captain went in one of the boats to take soundings around her but she had gone aground at high tide. There were not enough boats to accommodate all the {{passengers and}} crew so he determined to wait until daylight {{to see if there was}} any dry land to which survivors could be taken by boat and raft. The passengers were in fear because the vessel was rolling heavily and striking violently with each roll. At daybreak on 8 October, the Captain succeeded in getting through the breakers to a landing place on one of the two sand islets which rose about 7 ft above ordinary high-water mark. Preparations were at once made to transfer the passengers and crew to the spot, the passengers being lowered in a chair over the stern because it was impossible to keep a boat alongside due to the heavy rolling. By 07:00, all were landed. The islet was covered with pig-weed but there was no water so this was ferried from the wreck. Four of the five water-puncheons were lost, being stove-in by debris or having drifted away. There were 117 persons on the reef. For the first two days they had a pint of water each in temperatures of 112 F degrees. A tent was constructed for shelter. The islet was infested with <b>land-crabs</b> and various vermin. They stayed on the islet for 10 days and during that period had recovered from the wreck sufficient water and stores to serve a hundred people for a hundred days. Captain Swanson had left, in the lifeboat, on 11 October 1865, to sail towards Pernambuco. After making 120 miles he was picked up by the American ship Hayara and dropped 15 miles from his destination. There, he procured the assistance of the Oneida, Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, which came to the island and took all hands safely to Southampton. The Captain remained in Pernambuco.|$|R
6000|$|Wilky {{had a bad}} day {{yesterday}} and kept me busy or I shouldn't have [...] delayed answering your inquiries till to-day. He is very severely [...] wounded both in the ankle and in the side--where he doesn't heal so [...] fast as the doctor wishes in consequence of the shell having made a [...] pouch which collects matter and retards nature. They cut it open [...] yesterday, and to-day he is better, or will be. The wound in the [...] ankle was made by a cannister ball {{an inch and a half}} in diameter, [...] which lodged eight days in the foot and was finally dislodged by [...] cutting down through (the foot) and taking it out at the sole. He [...] is excessively weak, unable to do anything but lie passive, even [...] to turn himself on his pillow. He will probably have a slow and [...] tedious recovery--the doctors say of a year at least; but he knows [...] nothing of this himself and speaks, so far as he does talk, but of [...] going back in the Fall. If you write please say nothing of this; he [...] is so distressed at the thought of a long sickness. He is vastly [...] attached to the negro-soldier cause; believes (I think) that the [...] world has existed for it; and is sure that enormous results to [...] civilisation are coming out of it. We heard from Bob this morning [...] at Morris Island; with his regiment, building earthworks and [...] mounting guns. Hot, he says, but breezy; also that the shells make [...] for them every few minutes--while he and his men betake themselves [...] to the trenches and holes in the earth [...] "like so many <b>land-crabs</b> in [...] distress." [...] He writes in the highest spirits. Cabot Russell, Wilky's [...] dearest friend, is, we fear, a prisoner and wounded. We hear [...] nothing decisive, but the indications point that way. Poor Wilky [...] cries aloud for his friends gone and missing, and I could hardly [...] have supposed he might be educated so suddenly up to serious [...] manhood altogether as he appears to have been. I hear from Frank [...] Shaw this morning, and they are all well--and admirable.|$|R
6000|$|... . At {{the close}} of a winter day, [...] Their anchors down, by London town, the Three Great Captains lay; [...] And one was Admiral of the North from Solway Firth to Skye, [...] And one was Lord of the Wessex coast and all the lands thereby, [...] And one was Master of the Thames from Limehouse to Blackwall, [...] And he was Captain of the Fleet -- the bravest of them all. [...] Their good guns guarded their great gray sides [...] that were thirty foot in the sheer, [...] When there came a certain trading-brig with news of a privateer. [...] Her rigging was rough with the clotted drift that drives in a Northern breeze, [...] Her sides were clogged with the lazy weed that spawns in the Eastern seas. [...] Light she rode in the rude tide-rip, to left and right she rolled, [...] And the skipper sat on the scuttle-butt and stared at an empty hold. [...] "I ha' paid Port dues for your Law," [...] quoth he, [...] "and where is the Law ye boast [...] If I sail unscathed from a heathen port to be robbed on a Christian coast? [...] Ye have smoked the hives of the Laccadives as we burn the lice in a bunk, [...] We tack not now to a Gallang prow or a {{plunging}} Pei-ho junk; [...] I had no fear but the seas were clear {{as far as a}} sail might fare [...] Till I met with a lime-washed Yankee brig that rode off Finisterre. [...] There were canvas blinds to his bow-gun ports to screen the weight he bore, [...] And the signals ran for a merchantman from Sandy Hook to the Nore. [...] He would not fly the Rovers' flag -- the bloody or the black, [...] But now he floated the Gridiron and now he flaunted the Jack. [...] He spoke of the Law as he crimped my crew -- he swore it was only a loan; [...] But when I would ask for my own again, he swore it was none of my own. [...] He has taken my little parrakeets that nest beneath the Line, [...] He has stripped my rails of the shaddock-frails and the green unripened pine; [...] He has taken my bale of dammer and spice I won beyond the seas, [...] He has taken my grinning heathen gods -- and what should he want o' these? [...] My foremast would not mend his boom, my deckhouse patch his boats; [...] He has whittled the two, this Yank Yahoo, to peddle for shoe-peg oats. [...] I could not fight for the failing light and a rough beam-sea beside, [...] But I hulled him once for a clumsy crimp and twice because he lied. [...] Had I had guns (as I had goods) to work my Christian harm, [...] I had run him up from his quarter-deck to trade with his own yard-arm; [...] I had nailed his ears to my capstan-head, and ripped them off with a saw, [...] And soused them in the bilgewater, and served them to him raw; [...] I had flung him blind in a rudderless boat to rot in the rocking dark, [...] I had towed him aft of his own craft, a bait for his brother shark; [...] I had lapped him round with cocoa husk, and drenched him with the oil, [...] And lashed him fast to his own mast to blaze above my spoil; [...] I had stripped his hide for my hammock-side, [...] and tasselled his beard i' the mesh, [...] And spitted his crew on the live bamboo [...] that grows through the gangrened flesh; [...] I had hove him down by the mangroves brown, [...] where the mud-reef sucks and draws, [...] Moored by the heel to his own keel to wait for the <b>land-crab's</b> claws! [...] He is lazar within and lime without, ye can nose him far enow, [...] For he carries the taint of a musky ship -- the reek of the slaver's dhow!" [...] The skipper looked at the tiering guns and the bulwarks tall and cold, [...] And the Captains Three full courteously peered down at the gutted hold, [...] And the Captains Three called courteously from deck to scuttle-butt: -- [...] "Good Sir, we ha' dealt with that merchantman or ever your teeth were cut. [...] Your words be words of a lawless race, and the Law it standeth thus: [...] He comes of a race that have never a Law, and he never has boarded us. [...] We ha' sold him canvas and rope and spar -- we know that his price is fair, [...] And we know that he weeps for the lack of a Law as he rides off Finisterre. [...] And since he is damned for a gallows-thief by you and better than you, [...] We hold it meet that the English fleet should know that we hold him true." [...] The skipper called to the tall taffrail: -- [...] "And what is that to me? [...] Did ever you hear of a Yankee brig that rifled a Seventy-three? [...] Do I loom so large from your quarter-deck that I lift like a ship o' the Line? [...] He has learned to run from a shotted gun and harry such craft as mine. [...] There is never a Law on the Cocos Keys to hold a white man in, [...] But we do not steal the niggers' meal, for that is a nigger's sin. [...] Must he have his Law as a quid to chaw, or laid in brass on his wheel? [...] Does he steal with tears when he buccaneers? [...] 'Fore Gad, then, why does he steal?" [...] The skipper bit on a deep-sea word, and the word it was not sweet, [...] For he could see the Captains Three had signalled to the Fleet. [...] But three and two, in white and blue, the whimpering flags began: -- [...] "We have heard a tale of a -- foreign sail, but he is a merchantman." [...] The skipper peered beneath his palm and swore by the Great Horn Spoon: -- [...] "'Fore Gad, the Chaplain of the Fleet would bless my picaroon!" [...] By two and three the flags blew free to lash the laughing air: -- [...] "We have sold our spars to the merchantman -- we know that his price is fair." [...] The skipper winked his Western eye, and swore by a China storm: -- [...] "They ha' rigged him a Joseph's jury-coat to keep his honour warm." [...] The halliards twanged against the tops, the bunting bellied broad, [...] The skipper spat in the empty hold and mourned for a wasted cord. [...] Masthead -- masthead, the signal sped by the line o' the British craft; [...] The skipper called to his Lascar crew, and put her about and laughed: -- [...] "It's mainsail haul, my bully boys all -- we'll out to the seas again -- [...] Ere they set us to paint their pirate saint, or scrub at his grapnel-chain. [...] It's fore-sheet free, with her head to the sea, [...] and the swing of the unbought brine -- [...] We'll make no sport in an English court till we come as a ship o' the Line: [...] Till we come as a ship o' the Line, my lads, of thirty foot in the sheer, [...] Lifting again from the outer main with news of a privateer; [...] Flying his pluck at our mizzen-truck for weft of Admiralty, [...] Heaving his head for our dipsey-lead in sign that we keep the sea. [...] Then fore-sheet home as she lifts to the foam -- we stand on the outward tack, [...] We are paid in the coin of the white man's trade -- [...] the bezant is hard, ay, and black. [...] The frigate-bird shall carry my word to the Kling and the Orang-Laut [...] How a man may sail from a heathen coast to be robbed in a Christian port; [...] How a man may be robbed in Christian port while Three Great Captains there [...] Shall dip their flag to a slaver's rag -- to show that his trade is fair!" ...|$|R
