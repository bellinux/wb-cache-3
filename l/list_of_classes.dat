25|$|From 1859, the GCR {{identified}} {{different classes}} using an alphanumeric system. The first <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>classes</b> {{was a simple}} list of numbers from 1 onward. Number 18 was the highest allocated. Thence, newly built classes received class numbers with a letter suffix rather than using more numbers. By 1923, the '9' series (the largest) had reached '9Q'. Of themselves the letters and numbers had no meaning; {{they appear to have}} been allocated randomly.|$|E
25|$|Gymnasiums {{have its}} courses (smerovi), {{and the most}} common ones are the Socio-Linguistics Course, Science-Mathematics Course, Information Technology Course, Bilingual Course, and the General Course. Students can only choose one course (they do it when they write their wish list for {{preferred}} schools and courses) and they usually don't change it until they graduate. Every course has the same number and <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>classes,</b> but the difference is in their schedules (for example, the Socio-Linguistic Course might have English classes five times a week, while the Science-Mathematics Course offers two English classes a week).|$|E

25|$|Pāṇini's {{systematic}} approach to analysis includes components for: (a) forming grammatical rules, (b) {{an inventory of}} sounds, (c) a list of verbal roots organized into sublists, and (d) a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>classes</b> of morphs. Bloomfield's approach to key linguistic ideas in his textbook Language reflect the influence of Pāṇini in his treatment of basic concepts such as linguistic form, free form, and others. Similarly, Pāṇini is the source for Bloomfield's use of the terms exocentric and endocentric used to describe compound words. Concepts from Pāṇini are found in Eastern Ojibwa, published posthumously in 1958, in particular {{his use of the}} concept of a morphological zero, a morpheme that has no overt realization. Pāṇini's influence is also present in Bloomfield's approach to determining parts of speech (Bloomfield uses the term 'form-classes') in both Eastern Ojibwa and in the later Menomini language, published posthumously in 1962.|$|E
