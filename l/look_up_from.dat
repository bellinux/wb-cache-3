25|$|The Landscape {{with the}} Fall of Icarus, now {{thought to be}} an early copy, {{combines}} several elements of northern Renaissance painting. It hints at the renewed interest for antiquity (the Icarus legend), but the hero Icarus is hidden away in the background. The main actors in the painting are nature itself and, most prominently, the peasant, who does not even <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> his plough when Icarus falls. Brueghel shows man as an anti-hero, comical and sometimes grotesque.|$|E

In order to analyse opponents, he would <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the scrum before the ball was fed.|$|E

2500|$|... "Every {{room has}} a {{relationship}} with something in the landscape that’s different from the room next door," [...] Heymann says. [...] "Each of the rooms feels like a slightly different place." [...] In the guest bathroom, for example, when you <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the sink, you look out on an oak tree rather than into a mirror, which is on a side wall.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} where the true {{identity}} of mikoshi-nyūdō is unclear, {{but there are}} regions where they are animals that possess the ability to transform. In the legends of Hinoemata, Minamiaizu District, Fukushima Prefecture, they are shapeshifted weasels, and {{it is said that}} if one gets lured to <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> the nyūdō's expansion, the weasel would take that opening and bit at one's throat. In the [...] "Tonoigusa," [...] they are shapeshifted tanuki, and there are also some regions where they are shapeshifted foxes (kitsune). In the Shinano Province (now Nagano Prefecture), they are said to be shapeshifted mujina. Also, in the aforementioned Hinoemata, it is said that the mikoshi-nyūdō's true form is a hand-held object like a paper lantern, bucket, or rudder, {{and that it would be}} possible to exterminate the nyūdō by striking at the object.|$|E
