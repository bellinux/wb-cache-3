5|$|In Mississippi, {{coastal areas}} {{reported}} heavy amounts of precipitation, reaching over 10inches (250mm) in Jackson County. Sustained winds reached 47mph (76km/h) at Gulfport, the strongest wind on a <b>land</b> <b>station.</b> Similar to Alabama, strong waves caused considerable beach erosion along {{portions of the}} coastline.|$|E
5|$|As {{it became}} clear the stocks were nearly depleted, the world banned right whaling in 1937. The ban was largely successful, {{although}} violations continued for several decades. Madeira took its last two right whales in 1968. Japan took 23 Pacific right whales in the 1940s and more under scientific permit in the 1960s. Illegal whaling continued {{off the coast of}} Brazil for many years and the Imbituba <b>land</b> <b>station</b> processed right whales until 1973. The Soviet Union illegally took at least 3,212 southern right whales during the 1950s and '60s, although it reported taking only four.|$|E
5|$|Gale force {{winds and}} heavy {{rainfall}} {{were reported in}} the lower Florida Keys; Key West reported 6.25inches (160mm) during a 24-hour period, with the maximum reported winds at a <b>land</b> <b>station</b> being 70mph (115km/h) in the Dry Tortugas. Moderate rainfall was reported throughout southern Florida and the eastern Florida Keys, as well, peaking at 16.47inches (418mm) at Tavernier. Alberto spawned three tornadoes and a waterspout in the Florida Keys, one of which at Stock Island which damaged several boats. One of the three tornadoes picked up a moving car and lightly injured the driver. Another knocked down two telephone poles on the Overseas Highway, which resulted in an hour traffic delay. Damage from the tornadoes totaled $275,000 (1982USD, $620,000 2010USD).|$|E

25|$|Initially, {{all nations}} hired Basque whalers, {{although}} they gradually disappeared after their knowledge was learned by their companions. The whaling method {{was based on}} landing the whale, {{where it would be}} partitioned and the blubber boiled. With a high concentration of whales close to land, the method was efficient, as the companies would split the crew between the <b>land</b> <b>station</b> and hunting. The most famous <b>land</b> <b>station</b> was the Dutch Smeerenburg on Amsterdam Island which had up to 200 people employed. Because of the high costs involved, only larger companies conducted whaling. By the late 17th century there were between 200 and 300 ships and in excess of 10,000 whalers around Spitsbergen. The first overwintering was accidentally experienced by an English group in Bellsund in 1630–31. The first planned overwintering was achieved by the Noordsche Compagnie in 1633–34.|$|E
25|$|In {{the plans}} for an attack on Norway {{presented}} on 29 February 1940 to Hitler by General von Falkenhorst, Arendal {{was one of the}} Norwegian towns and cities to be captured in the initial invasion wave. Like the port town of Egersund, which was also to be seized, Arendal had a <b>land</b> <b>station</b> for one of the two undersea telegraph cables between Norway and the United Kingdom. The Germans set out to cut the cable to the United Kingdom, as well as securing the telegraph cables to Denmark and Cuxhaven in Germany. Arendal was also important as a telegraph junction for the southern parts of Norway, with German personnel tasked to listen in on Norwegian communications. Isolating Norway from the outside world was {{an important part of the}} German effort at pacifying the Norwegian population and discouraging resistance to the occupation.|$|E
25|$|When General von Falkenhorst {{delivered}} the initial {{plans for the}} invasions of Norway and Denmark to Hitler, on 29 February 1940, Egersund had been selected {{as one of the}} Norwegian targets for the first day. Egersund was considered important to secure because of the town having the Norwegian <b>land</b> <b>station</b> for an undersea telegraph cable from Norway to Peterhead, Scotland. By severing Norway's links with the outside world, the Germans intended to inhibit Allied intelligence from gaining information on the German invasion. It would also aid the Germans in gaining control of Norway's communications, and in using those communications to pacify the population and discourage resistance. Capturing Egersund would also allow the German invasion forces to cut the important road and railway links that led through the town. Further, the German planners feared that the good harbour at Egersund, if left unoccupied, could be used by Norwegian or Allied troops to attack Stavanger Airport, Sola, an airport which featured prominently in the German invasion plans.|$|E
50|$|Faced {{with these}} barriers, American Marconi {{initially}} concentrated on establishing {{a small number}} of high-powered <b>land</b> <b>stations,</b> which provided transatlantic communication in competition with the existing undersea telegraph cables, in addition to serving passenger vessels making the Atlantic crossing. As late as early 1912, the company had only five <b>land</b> <b>stations</b> and forty marine installations.|$|R
5000|$|The {{policy that}} had been adopted for ship {{stations}} assignments was [...] "W call letters in the west, and K call letters in the east". For <b>land</b> <b>stations,</b> the reverse was now implemented, with western <b>land</b> <b>stations</b> getting K calls, and eastern stations receiving W calls. This policy is still followed for broadcasting stations assignments.|$|R

Though surpassed {{less than a year}} later during the 1935 Labor Day hurricane in the Florida Keys, it remains the lowest value ever observed in mainland Japan and the third-lowest throughout the country. It briefly emerged over the Kii Channel before striking the Kaifu District in Tokushima Prefecture. The system then crossed the Kii Channel again and traversed Awaji Island. After another brief stint over water, the storm made its next landfall directly over Kobe, Hyōgo Prefecture, just [...] west of Osaka City. A barometric pressure of [...] was observed in Osaka. Crossing mainland Japan, the storm briefly emerged over the Sea of Japan before traversing northern Honshu.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the hurricane's {{landfall}} in Mexico, {{officials in}} Mazatlán executed {{the evacuation of}} over 2,000 people in vulnerable coastal areas; such preparations prevented any deaths or injuries. Additionally, the owners of fishing vessels were advised to secure their properties by moving them to a safer area. As a result, only one yacht was sunk during the hurricane, and no major damage was reported by the fishing industry. Prior to moving ashore, Roslyn dropped light rainfall in extreme southern Baja California Sur. On the mainland, precipitation extended to the southeast and northwest of where the hurricane moved ashore; the peak total was [...] to the southeast of Mazatlán. The brunt of the storm missed Mazatlán, instead affecting a sparsely-populated area. The highest reported winds from a <b>land</b> <b>station</b> were , with gusts to [...] Roslyn produced some flooding, but no serious damage. Impact was limited to flooded homes and factories, {{as well as some}} crop damage and beach erosion.|$|E

500|$|Off {{the coast}} of Louisiana, the {{hurricane}} wrecked three boats, but all the occupants were safely rescued. While making landfall in Louisiana, Edith resulted in above normal tides of up to 9.7feet (2.9m) above normal at Cypremont Point near Morgan City. The highest winds reported by a <b>land</b> <b>station</b> were 69mph (111km/h) at Cameron, where a wind gust of 96mph (155km/h) was also reported. However, {{due to the lack}} of recording instruments near the hurricane's landing point, whether higher winds occurred there is not known, although likely. Rainfall was moderate across Louisiana, including amounts of over 8inches (200mm) in the southwestern portion of the state. A strong rainband well ahead of the hurricane, combined with the intrusion of dry air into the hurricane's circulation, produced 16 tornadoes from Louisiana to Alabama. An F3 tornado touched down in the eastern residential suburbs of Baton Rouge, causing heavy property damage totaling $2.5million (1971 dollars, $ in [...] dollars) along its intermittent 7mile (11km) path. The tornado also injured three people. An F2 tornado in Tangipahoa Parish caused $250,000 in damage (1971 dollars, $ in [...] dollars) along its 4mile (6km) path, while an F1 tornado in St. Martin Parish injured 6people on its 3mile (5km) path. The hurricane caused extensive damage to the sugar cane crop in southwestern Louisiana. About a month after Edith struck the United States, President Richard Nixon declared portions of Louisiana as a disaster area, which allocated relief funds to aid the affected citizens.|$|E
