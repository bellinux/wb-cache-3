5|$|On 18 December 2013, {{production}} of Block 2 JF-17s began at PAC's Kamra facility. These aircraft have air-to-air refuelling capability, improved avionics, enhanced <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> capacity, data link, and electronic warfare capabilities. Block 2 construction activity is planned to run until 2016, {{after which the}} manufacturing of further developed Block 3 aircraft is planned.

5|$|Amidst the {{backdrop}} of the Battle of Britain, while stationed on Salisbury Plain the battalion carried out garrison duties and undertook training to enable them to rapidly respond in the event that an invasion took place. They received a large amount of new equipment during this time to improve their mobility, including new Universal carriers, weapons and lightweight personal <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> equipment. They also experienced German air attacks for the first time, and on 8 July 1940, the battalion incurred its first casualty when one of its members was wounded in an air raid. In early October, the 2/10th undertook a large-scale exercise near Tidworth, and then {{in the middle of the}} month, as winter set in they were moved to Colchester, where they replaced the tents they had been living in with the stone buildings and Nissen huts of Hyderabad Barracks. The battalion's stay there was short-lived, though, for the following month, after the threat of invasion had passed, the order arrived for the Australians to embark for the Middle East. The 2/10th subsequently entrained at Colchester in mid-November and moved north to Scotland where, on 17 November, they boarded the Straithaird.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{trend is}} toward wood-composite aircraft. The basic <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> {{material}} is still wood, {{but it is}} combined with foam (for instance to increase buckling resistance of <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> plywood skins) and other synthetic materials like glass- and carbon fibre (to locally increase the modulus of <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> structures like spar caps, etc.).|$|E

25|$|After {{the first}} stage of {{aggradation}} and sediment transport, the Kobuk began a new phase of erosion and landform development. The river exhausted its supply of easily erodible sediment upstream, thus decreasing its sediment load and increasing its <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> capacity downstream. With more capacity downstream, the river began to incise into the alluvial fan it previously created, moving sediment stored for a long time on its original floodplains to newer floodplains even further downstream.|$|E
25|$|The Indian Navy {{operates}} {{at least two}} squadrons of Heron and Searcher Mk-II UAVs, based in Kochi (INAS 342) and Porbandar (INAS 343). There are plans {{to have at least}} two more squadrons of UAVs. UAVs are controlled from ships to increases the range of surveillance. There are plans to introduce rotary UAVs into the Indian Navy. These UAVs will have higher endurance and <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> capability resulting in better reconnaissance capabilities.|$|E

25|$|Between 2 February and 6 March 1949, the Air Proving Ground {{conducted}} {{tests in}} conjunction with Wright-Patterson AFB {{to determine if the}} Republic F-84D Thunderjet had improved shortcomings in earlier models of the fighter. These concluded that the F-84 range, acceleration, versatility, <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> ability, high altitude climb, and level flight speed exceeded that of the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star. The F-84 was inferior to the F-80, however, in shortness of takeoff roll, low altitude climb, and maneuverability.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, pipe piles {{are filled}} with {{concrete}} to provide additional moment capacity or corrosion resistance. In the United Kingdom, this is generally not done {{in order to reduce}} the cost. In these cases corrosion protection is provided by allowing for a sacrificial thickness of steel or by adopting a higher grade of steel. If a concrete filled pipe pile is corroded, most of the <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> capacity of the pile will remain intact due to the concrete, while it will be lost in an empty pipe pile.|$|E
25|$|A bodypack is a {{backpack}} fitted {{with one or}} more pockets that are suspended on the wearer's chest and loaded {{in such a way that}} the load in the front and the load in the back are close to equal. The majority of the load in a bodypack is carried by the hips. The ideal <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> system should not disturb the wearer's natural posture, balance and maneuverability. The load must be dispersed onto the skeletal structure in an even manner, and should not produce unbalanced forces on the body.|$|E

25|$|After {{the end of}} the war, {{large numbers}} of surplus DH.9s became available, having been deemed to be surplus to {{requirements}} by their original military operators; accordingly, many were resold onto civil operators, such as by early aerial transport companies. Large numbers were modified to better perform as transport aircraft, such as the cabin being suitably adapted for the carriage of passengers. In this role, the DH.9 provided a useful <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> capability and were relatively inexpensive to procure. Accordingly, in various configurations, the type saw prolific use by civil operators.|$|E
25|$|The {{shape of}} the hull is entirely {{dependent}} upon {{the needs of the}} design. Shapes range from a nearly perfect box in the case of scow barges, to a needle-sharp surface of revolution {{in the case of a}} racing multihull sailboat. The shape is chosen to strike a balance between cost, hydrostatic considerations (accommodation, <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> and stability), hydrodynamics (speed, power requirements, and motion and behavior in a seaway) and special considerations for the ship's role, such as the rounded bow of an icebreaker or the flat bottom of a landing craft.|$|E
25|$|Asset tracking: {{companies}} {{needing to}} track valuable assets for insurance or other monitoring purposes can now plot the real-time asset location {{on a map}} and closely monitor movement and operating status. For example, haulage and logistics companies often operate trucks with detachable <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> units. In this case, trailers can be tracked independently of the cabs used to drive them.

50|$|There {{are three}} main types of lubrication: full-film condition, {{boundary}} condition, and dry condition. Full-film conditions are when the bearing's <b>load</b> is <b>carried</b> solely by {{a film of}} fluid lubricant {{and there is no}} contact between the two bearing surfaces. In mix or boundary conditions, <b>load</b> is <b>carried</b> partly by direct surface contact and partly by a film forming between the two.

25|$|When , the truss {{is said to}} be statically determinate, {{because the}} (m+3) {{internal}} member forces and support reactions can then be completely determined by 2j equilibrium equations, once we know the external loads and the geometry of the truss. Given a certain number of joints, this is the minimum number of members, in the sense that if any member is taken out (or fails), then the truss as a whole fails. While the relation (a) is necessary, it is not sufficient for stability, which also depends on the truss geometry, support conditions and the <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> capacity of the members.|$|E
25|$|The Marine Corps {{requested}} greater <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> capability in {{high temperatures}} for the Cobra in the 1970s. Bell used systems from its Model 309 {{to develop the}} AH-1T. This version had a lengthened tailboom and fuselage with an upgraded transmission and engines from the 309. Bell designed the AH-1T to be more reliable and easier to maintain in the field. The version was given full TOW missile capability with targeting system and other sensors. An advanced version, known as the AH-1T+ with more powerful T700-GE-700 engines and advanced avionics was proposed to Iran in the late 1970s, but {{the overthrow of the}} Shah of Iran resulted in the sale being canceled.|$|E
25|$|The M.F.3 type had {{a larger}} gondola {{and a more}} {{powerful}} engine than the earlier types used by the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service and was considered well suited to Norwegian conditions. The powerful engine made the aircraft able to take off from ice and snow, and tests at this were carried out at the Royal Norwegian Navy's main base of Karljohansvern in Horten {{during the winter of}} 19171918. The M.F.3's <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> ability also enabled the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service to carry out its first experiments at dropping torpedoes from an aircraft. M.F.3 F.14 carried out test drops of the Royal Norwegian Navy's Type 2 and Type 3 35cm torpedoes during the autumn of 1918. The torpedo tests carried out in 1918, and further tests in 1923, led to the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service deciding to acquire dedicated torpedo bombers. In 1924 the Douglas DT-2B was ordered from the Douglas Aircraft Company in California.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most {{existing}} and proposed Large Air Tankers (LATs), the DC-10 arrives at an FTA weighing {{significantly less than}} its certified MGTOW (Maximum Gross Takeoff Weight.) This is principally due to the reduced fuel <b>load</b> <b>carried</b> on fire missions.|$|R

50|$|A bus (archaically also omnibus, multibus, motorbus, autobus) is a {{road vehicle}} {{designed}} to carry many passengers. Buses {{can have a}} capacity as high as 300 passengers. The {{most common type of}} bus is the single-decker rigid bus, with larger <b>loads</b> <b>carried</b> by double-decker and articulated buses, and smaller <b>loads</b> <b>carried</b> by midibuses and minibuses; coaches are used for longer-distance services. Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare. Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus do not charge a fare. In many jurisdictions, bus drivers require a special licence above and beyond a regular driver's licence.|$|R
25|$|In North America, Datsun marketed the 810 series Bluebird sold as the Datsun 810 from February 1977 to 1980â€”the direct {{ancestor}} {{of the long}} running Datsun/Nissan Maxima range. The Datsun 810 model line began with the six-cylinder Nissan Bluebird 2000G6 sold in Japan. With a longer nose than the regular Bluebird, to accommodate a longer inline-six engine, it was powered by {{two versions of the}} SOHC L-series I6 engine: a 2.0L displacement for the Japanese market and a 2.4L24E unit (as found in the Datsun 240Z) for the US market. The Bluebird G6 used a carburetor for the base model and fuel injection for the sporty version. The 2.0L engine was good for 122PS JIS (90kW), while the bigger American engine could reach 125hp SAE (93kW). The sport version channeled power through a four-speed manual transmission for the sedan and wagon, five-speed transmission for the coupe. These cars were rear-wheel drive and had a semi-trailing arm rear suspension. The station wagon variant, only sold in North America, had a rear live axle for <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> reasons. Some fuel-injected versions had automatic transmissions.|$|E

According to local media, PAC rolled out the 16th Block 2 aircraft in December 2015 enabling the JF-17's 4th squadron formation. The JF-17B two seat version would start testing in September 2016.|$|E
500|$|To hunt fish, {{the eagle}} swoops {{down over the}} water and snatches the fish {{out of the water}} with its talons. They eat by holding the fish in one claw and tearing the flesh with the other. Eagles have {{structures}} on their toes called spicules that allow them to grasp fish. Osprey also have this adaptation. Bald eagles have powerful talons and have been recorded flying with a [...] mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) fawn. This feat is the record for the heaviest <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> ever verified for a flying bird. It has been estimated that the gripping power (pounds by square inch) of the bald eagle is ten times greater than that of a human. Bald eagles can fly with fish at least equal to their own weight, but if the fish is too heavy to lift, the eagle may be dragged into the water. It may swim to safety, in some cases pulling the catch along to the shore as it swims, but some eagles drown or succumb to hypothermia. Many sources claim that bald eagles, like all large eagles, cannot normally take flight carrying prey more than half of their own weight unless aided by favorable wind conditions. On numerous occasions, when large prey such as mature salmon or geese are attacked, eagles have been seen to make contact and then drag the prey in a strenuously labored, low flight over the water to a bank, where they then finish off and dismember the prey. When food is abundant, an eagle can gorge itself by storing up to [...] of food in a pouch in the throat called a crop. Gorging allows the bird to fast for several days if food becomes unavailable. Occasionally, bald eagles may hunt cooperatively when confronting prey, especially relatively large prey such as jackrabbits or herons, with one bird distracting potential prey, while the other comes behind it in order to ambush it. While hunting waterfowl, bald eagles repeatedly fly at a target and cause it to dive repeatedly, hoping to exhaust the victim so it can be caught (white-tailed eagles have been recorded hunting waterfowl in the same way). When hunting concentrated prey, a successful catch which often results in the hunting eagle being pursued by other eagles and needing to find an isolated perch for consumption if it is able to carry it away successfully.|$|E
40|$|Data are {{presented}} for {{the division of}} load among the wing, fuselage and tail for several aircraft configurations at subsonic and supersonic speeds. These data were obtained on full-scale airplanes-, rocket-propelled models, and in low-speed wind-tunnel tests.

The present, assumption that the fuselage <b>carries</b> <b>load</b> proportional {{to the area of}} the wing blanketed by the fuselage is shown to be roughly correct at low speeds and at supersonic speeds for the configurations tested. In one series of wind-tunnel tests it is shown that wing incidence does snot materially affect the component of additional <b>load</b> <b>carried</b> by the wing or fuselage.
