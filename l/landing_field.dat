5|$|After {{completing}} its {{strikes on}} the Tokyo region, the Allied fleet conducted an at-sea replenishment from 21 to 23 July before attacking Kure and the Inland Sea from the 24th to the 28th of the month. On {{the night of}} 24/25 July, CruDiv17 patrolled the Kii Channel and bombarded the naval seaplane base at Kushimoto, a <b>landing</b> <b>field</b> near Cape Shionomisaki, and a radio station. This attack lasted for only four minutes and caused little damage.|$|E
5|$|Besides their guerrilla activities, {{these groups}} {{also participated in}} many pivotal battles during the liberation of the islands. In Cebu, guerrillas and irregulars under Lieutenant James M. Cushing and Basilio J. Valdes aided in the Battle for Cebu City. They were also {{successful}} in their capture of Maj. Gen. Takeo Manjom and his 2,000 soldiers and munitions. Panay guerrillas under Col. Macario Peralta helped in the seizing of the Tiring <b>Landing</b> <b>Field</b> and Mandurriao district airfield during the Battle of the Visayas. Major Ingeniero commanded the guerrilla forces in Bohol, {{in which they were}} credited in the liberation of the island from Japanese outposts at a cost of only seven men.|$|E
25|$|The grass <b>landing</b> <b>field</b> at Hapupu, at the {{northern}} end of the Island, proved a limiting factor, as few aircraft apart from the Bristol Freighter had both the range to fly to the islands and the ruggedness to land on the grass airstrip. Although other aircraft did use the <b>landing</b> <b>field</b> occasionally, they would often require repairs to fix damage resulting from the rough landing. Hapupu is also the site of the JM Barker (Hapupu) National Historic Reserve (one of only two in New Zealand) where there are momori rakau (Moriori tree carvings).|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} drops {{it can make}} in a day is only limited {{by the time it}} takes to reload the {{aircraft}} with water/fire retardant and fuel, as well as its need for a proper <b>landing</b> <b>field,</b> which may well be a considerable distance from the fire.|$|E
25|$|Elvenes {{was first}} used during an 6,000-man {{exercise}} in August 1915. The newly established Army Air Service wanted to test out its Blériot XI, a task given to Tryggve Gran. His first job {{was to find a}} suitable <b>landing</b> <b>field</b> near Setermoen, the center of the exercise. This took place at Elvevold. Their task during the exercise was to fly reconnaissance, mark the enemy by dropping smoke bombs and taking aerial photography.|$|E

25|$|But Washington Airport {{was only}} {{marginally}} safer than Hoover Field. Arlington Beach, a local amusement park with a Ferris wheel and high rollercoasters, was located {{to the northeast}} (on the downstream side of Highway Bridge), and a landfill existed on the eastern side. The trash in the landfill was also on fire. The smoke sometimes obscured the <b>landing</b> <b>field,</b> and the stench was notorious through the city of Washington. The owners also {{could not afford to}} pave the runways.|$|E
25|$|Bermuda Record On June 29, 1930, Columbia {{performed}} the first non-stop flight from New York to Bermuda and back. The flight dropped off mail, {{but there was}} not a suitable <b>landing</b> <b>field</b> on the island at the time. The flight was piloted by Erroll Boyd, Roger Q. Williams, and Harry P. Conner took 17 hours, 3 minutes. Williams relocated Columbia to Montreal just two days before a hangar fire destroyed Columbia Airlines' newest plane, the underperforming Uncle Sam.|$|E
25|$|With the {{information}} obtained from Learmonth’s radio commentary the problem plaguing the Australian-built Beauforts was {{traced to a}} component in the elevator trim tab actuating unit. All the RAAF Beauforts were grounded until they were modified to eliminate the problem. Learmonth is credited with supplying the vital information that was necessary to identify the problem and eventually solve it. A secret World War II <b>landing</b> <b>field</b> at Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia, known only by the code-name Potshot, was eventually developed into a permanent military base and named RAAF Learmonth in honour of Wing Commander Charles Learmonth.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{the minimum}} {{dimensions}} for dry, hard <b>landing</b> <b>fields</b> {{are defined by}} the FAR <b>Landing</b> And Takeoff <b>Field</b> Lengths. These include considerations for safety margins during landing and takeoff. Heavier aircraft require longer runways.|$|R
50|$|The Navy also {{operates}} {{a number of}} austere unmanned or minimally manned airfields known as Naval Auxiliary <b>Landing</b> <b>Fields</b> (NALF), Naval Outlying <b>Landing</b> <b>Fields</b> (NOLF), or more simply Outlying Fields (OLF). The vast majority of these fields conduct training operations, either within the Naval Air Training Command in Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Texas, or in support of operational units in Fleet Concentration Areas for readiness purposes, such as <b>field</b> carrier <b>landing</b> practice (FCLP).|$|R
50|$|The next {{use of the}} {{airfield}} was when the Department of Commerce refitted the facility {{as one of its}} network of Intermediate <b>Landing</b> <b>Fields,</b> which were established in the 1920s & 1930s to serve as emergency <b>landing</b> <b>fields</b> along commercial airways between major cities. It was also used by the City of Marfa as their municipal airport. However, the Marfa Municipal Airport continued to be used by the Army Air Corps on an as-needed basis until the beginning of World War II.|$|R
25|$|The 1st Bomb Squadron {{conducted}} {{its first}} combat mission on 9 February 1945, against a Japanese naval airfield {{located on the}} island of Moen at Truk atoll (now known as the Chuuk Islands). Flown by day at an altitude of , it was in actuality a further training mission, encountering no opposition. Its second mission was to Iwo Jima on 12 February, one week prior to D-Day for Operation Detachment. The capture of Iwo Jima had as its objective an emergency <b>landing</b> <b>field</b> for Twentieth Air Force bombers attacking Japan and a base for escorting P-51 and P-47 fighters.|$|E
25|$|Yokota Air Base {{was used}} in the {{aftermath}} of the earthquake as a <b>landing</b> <b>field</b> for commercial flights as Tokyo Narita Airport was closed. The Navy helicopters based at Naval Air Facility Atsugi and elsewhere were made available for search and rescue immediately after the tsunami, including searching off-shore debris fields and later assisted with food drops. P-3 Orion aircraft were used to do damage surveys. Amphibious landing craft and utility landing craft (LCUs) were used to deploy U.S and Japanese troops and supplies to areas where docks were damaged. Japan electrical company trucks were moved by U.S. LCUs from , notably to Oshima Island.|$|E
25|$|The {{airport was}} {{created as a}} simple <b>landing</b> <b>field</b> in 1933. With the {{break-out}} of World War II the airport {{was used by the}} Norwegian Army Air Service as a stop-over for flights heading to Northern Norway. After the German forces took control of the area in 1940 they immediately started construction of a wooden runway. More than a thousand people participated in the construction. This allowed them to use the airfield as a stopover for Junkers Ju 87s, especially for bombing raids during the Battles of Narvik. Throughout the war the airport saw daily landings of bombers in transit between Southern and Northern Norway.|$|E

25|$|The TBM 900 model {{features}} several ergonomic improvements within the cockpit, increasing both simplicity and automation. A new single power lever integrates the power, propeller and condition lever controls. Various switches and controls, such as some formerly present upon the overhead panel, have been eliminated. The electrical system {{is powered by}} a single main generator, which is supplemented by a belt-driven alternator. On the TBM 900, electrical load distribution changes enable the Garmin G1000 glass cockpit to power up in sync with the switch-on of the battery with little battery drain. The G1000 also has upgraded displays, including an ISA temperature deviation indication, integrated weather radar and MFD map, and automatic <b>landing</b> <b>field</b> elevation inputs to the pressurization controller.|$|E
25|$|On 1 July 1944 the {{squadron}} relocated again, {{this time to}} Sattler Airfield in the Northern Territory. Responsibility for defending Darwin had been handed over to two Royal Air Force squadrons; No. 452 Squadron was reassigned to ground-attack missions. The squadron began attacking targets in the Dutch East Indies and on 11 December 1944 it was sent to Morotai, where it {{was assigned to the}} 1st Tactical Air Force, to support the Australian operations in Kalimantan, flying mainly ground attack missions and anti-shipping strikes. The ground staff were sent to Juwata airfield on Tarakan in May 1945 but operations had to wait until the <b>landing</b> <b>field</b> was ready. The squadron undertook missions against Kelabaken and Simalumong on 2 July; further attacks occurred on Tawoa on 10 July. A detachment moved to Balikpapan on 15 July and began operations to support Australian troops there. The detachment remained {{until the end of the}} war, flying its last sortie on 10 August 1945; its final aerial victory of the war came on 24 July when a Japanese bomber was shot down in a night raid over Balikpapan.|$|E
25|$|On 12 August 1968, two Syrian {{air force}} lieutenants, Walid Adham and Radfan Rifai, {{took off in}} a pair of MiG-17Fs on a {{training}} mission. They lost their way and, believing they were over Lebanon, landed at the Beset <b>Landing</b> <b>Field</b> in northern Israel. (One version has it that they were led astray by an Arabic-speaking Israeli). Prior to the end of 1968 these MiG-17s were transferred from Israeli stocks and added to the Area 51 test fleet. The aircraft were given USAF designations and fake serial numbers so that they could be identified in DOD standard flight logs. As in the earlier program, a small group of Air Force and Navy pilots conducted mock dogfights with the MiG-17s. Selected instructors from the Navy's Top Gun school at NAS Miramar, California, were chosen to fly against the MiGs for familiarization purposes. Very soon, the MiG-17's shortcomings became clear. It had an extremely simple, even crude, control system which lacked the power-boosted controls of American aircraft. The F-4's twin engines were so powerful it could accelerate out of range of the MiG-17's guns in thirty seconds. It was important for the F-4 to keep its distance from the MiG-17. As long as the F-4 was one and a half miles from the MiG-17, it was outside the reach of the Soviet fighter's guns, but the MiG was within reach of the F-4's missiles.|$|E
5000|$|Note: Airports at Claremont, Concord, Laconia and Nashua {{were used}} by the USAAF during the war as <b>landing</b> <b>fields</b> for {{transient}} aircraft (as well by the Navy), but were not considered military airfields.|$|R

50|$|This species prefers high-altitude environments rich in nitrates, at {{elevation}} {{of up to}} 2000 to 2400 m above sea level. It {{can be found in}} arable <b>land,</b> <b>fields,</b> yards, rubbish dumps, roadsides and shores.|$|R
500|$|Twelve {{companies}} {{worked in}} Death Valley using Civilian Conservation Corps workers during the Great Depression {{and on into}} the early 1940s. They built barracks, graded [...] of roads, installed water and telephone lines, and erected a total of 76 buildings. Trails in the Panamint Range were built to points of scenic interest, and an adobe village, laundry and trading post were constructed for Shoshone Native Americans. Five campgrounds, restrooms, an airplane <b>landing</b> <b>field</b> and picnic facilities were also built.|$|E
500|$|Other Depression-era {{public works}} {{projects}} shaped the area. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) had at least two camps for World War I veterans in the Quehanna area, and built the Karthaus emergency <b>landing</b> <b>field</b> for airmail planes, {{similar to those that}} became Mid-State Regional Airport and Cherry Springs Airport. The [...] airfield was built in 1935 and 1936 along Hoover Road (the old Driftwood Pike), just north of what is now Wykoff Run Natural Area. During World War II, the landing strip was blocked to prevent enemy planes from secretly landing there.|$|E
500|$|The Navy {{replaced}} its PK, F5L, and H16 aircraft with newer models (see table below). In 1933 VP-8F {{arrived on}} station, and in 1935 the army bombers {{had become too}} large to be maintained and stored at Luke Field. Construction began on a new Army airfield, Hickam Army Airfield, named after pioneer U.S. Army Air Corps pilot Lieutenant Colonel Horace Meek Hickam. From 1936 to 1940 Pan American flew its Clipper service into Ford Island, {{using it as a}} refueling stop between the United States and Asia. The Navy built a $25,000 boathouse, spent $579,565 on a new crew barracks and built a firehouse, water-supply and lighting systems. In June 1936 the Navy lengthened the island's <b>landing</b> <b>field</b> by , to [...] In March 1937 Amelia Earhart, on her second visit to Luke Field, crashed her Lockheed Electra on takeoff.|$|E
50|$|Blocking {{of landing}} {{areas on the}} island {{occupied}} large amounts of time and manpower due to the extensive areas involved and the comparatively smooth surfaces surrounding the field, {{which could be used}} as <b>landing</b> <b>fields.</b>|$|R

50|$|Like the Navy, the Marine Corps also {{operates}} {{a number of}} austere unmanned or minimally manned airfields known as Marine Corps Auxiliary <b>Landing</b> <b>Fields</b> (MCALF), Marine Corps Outlying <b>Landing</b> <b>Fields</b> (MCOLF), or more simply Outlying Fields (OLF). Since the Marines' flight training is combined with the Navy and the Coast Guard, those fields dedicated to training of student aviators in the southeastern United States remain under Navy control. As a result, the Marine Corps' auxiliary fields support operational Fleet Marine Force (FMF) units for readiness purposes, such as <b>field</b> carrier <b>landing</b> practice (FCLP) for fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft embarking on aircraft carriers or amphibious assault ships.|$|R
