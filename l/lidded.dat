5|$|From Seattle, SR520 crosses Lake Washington on the tolled Evergreen Point Floating Bridge; at , it is {{the longest}} {{floating}} bridge in the world. Tolls are collected electronically using the state's Good to Go pass or by mail, and vary based on time of day and number of axles; the minimum Good to Go toll, , is $1.25 between midnight and 5a.m., and the maximum is $4.30 during the morning and evening peak periods. The freeway reaches {{the eastern end of}} Lake Washington at Evergreen Point in northern Medina, where it travels under a <b>lidded</b> park and next to a median-side bus station. After an interchange and lid at 84th Avenue Northeast in Hunts Point, SR520 travels eastward around the northern edge of Clyde Hill in a north-facing arc, passing through the Yarrow Point lid and bus station. The freeway enters Bellevue, intersecting I-405 and crossing over the Eastside Rail Corridor. SR520 continues along {{the north side of the}} Bel-Red industrial area and enters the Overlake area of Redmond.|$|E
5|$|Organic finds {{are rarely}} well {{documented}} with hoards, because most coin and treasure finds are removed hastily by the finder or have previously been disrupted by farm work rather than excavated. The Hoxne organic finds included bone, wood and other plant material, and leather. Small fragments from a decorated ivory pyxis (a cylindrical <b>lidded</b> box) were found, {{along with more}} than 150 tiny shaped pieces of bone inlay or veneer, probably from a wooden box or boxes that have decayed. Minuscule fragments of wood adhering to metal objects were identified as belonging to nine species of timber, all native to Britain: wood traces associated with the iron fittings of the outer chest established that {{it was made of}} oak. Silver locks and hinges were from two small wooden boxes or caskets, one made of decorative cherry wood and one made of yew. Some wheat straw survived from padding between the plain silver bowls, which also bore faint traces of linen cloth. Leather fragments were too degraded for identification.|$|E
5|$|The Greek meander pattern at {{the foot}} of the wall is unusually close to the picture plane, {{confining}} the sitter. The wall is painted in gold, adding to the sense of a monumental portrait of a modern icon. The details of Bertin's face are highly symmetrical. His eyes are heavily <b>lidded,</b> circled by oppositely positioned twists of his white collar, the winds of his hair, eyebrows and eyelids. His mouth turns downwards at the left and upwards to the right. This dual expression is intended to show his duality and complex personality: he is a hard-nosed businessman, and a patron of the arts. The reflection of a window can be seen in the rim of Bertin's chair. It is barely discernible, but adds spatial depth. The Portrait of Pope Leo X (c. 1519) by Raphael, a source for the Bertin portrait, also features a window reflection of the pommel on the pope's chair.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present investigation was to formulate solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) for improving the dermal delivery of a local anesthetic agent lidocaine (<b>LID).</b> SLN and NLC were characterized for particle size distribution, polydispersity index, entrapment efficiency, X-ray powder diffraction pattern (XRD), thermal behavior by differential scanning colorimeter (DSC) and surface morphology by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). LID-loaded SLN and NLC were formulated into hydrogels for topical application. The in vitro permeation profiles of <b>LID</b> SLN gel, <b>LID</b> NLC gel, and a marketed <b>LID</b> formulation (Xylocaine® gel) were evaluated by using guinea pig skin. The in vivo efficacy of <b>LID</b> SLN gel, <b>LID</b> NLC gel, and a marketed <b>LID</b> formulation (Xylocaine® gel) gel was evaluated on guinea pig using pinprick test. <b>LID</b> SLN showed a particle size of 78. 1  nm with a polydispersity index of 0. 556, whereas <b>LID</b> NLC showed a particle size of 72. 8  nm with a polydispersity index of 0. 463. The entrapment efficiency of <b>LID</b> in both SLN and NLC was 97 % and 95. 9 %, respectively. The TEM studies revealed the almost spherical nature of <b>LID</b> SLN and NLC formulations. The XRD and DSC studies of <b>LID</b> SLN suggested amorphization of drug in the carrier system. The SLN formulation was stable with respect to particle size, polydispersity, and entrapment efficiency for 6  months at 40 °C/ 75 % relative humidity (RH).

(3) The function and appearance of the upper <b>lid</b> need not be interfered with. (4) No external scars are produced except when a lash transplant is done.

40|$|Objectives: To {{study the}} factors and {{possible}} mechanisms associated with decreased self-awareness of levodopa-induced dyskinesias (<b>LIDs)</b> {{in patients with}} Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: We enrolled 30 PD patients with <b>LIDs.</b> Patients were video-recorded in an "on" phase while experiencing <b>LIDs.</b> <b>LIDs</b> were objectively rated {{by means of the}} Unified Dyskinesias Rating Scale (UDyRS) by two movement disorders specialists while examining the patients. Patients were asked to rate the body site and the severity of their <b>LIDs</b> according to the 5 -point UDyRS. Patients then rated their own <b>LIDs</b> while watching the video recording of themselves. Lastly, the patients rated the <b>LIDs</b> of other reference PD patients on a video recording. The same reference video recordings were shown to 15 healthy individuals matched for age, gender and education. Results: Seven of the 30 PD patients investigated were subjectively unaware of the presence of their <b>LIDs.</b> The majority of patients, however, recognized their <b>LIDs</b> when watching video recording of themselves. Patients displayed a specific poor self-awareness of trunk <b>LIDs,</b> in both the subjective evaluation and in the video recording-based subjective evaluation. By contrast PD patients correctly recognized <b>LIDs</b> in video recordings of reference PD patients. Poor self-awareness correlated with predominance of motor symptoms on the left body side. Conclusions: Poor self-awareness of <b>LIDs</b> is present in a proportion of PD patients as a form of anosognosia. The poor self-awareness of <b>LIDs</b> in the trunk is likely to be due to a complex interplay involving both anosognosic mechanisms and deficits in proprioceptive axial kinesthesia.

Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (TLL) is a well-characterised lipase, known to exhibit interfacial activation during which a <b>lid</b> region covering the active site becomes displaced upon interaction with an interface. In this study, we investigate the effect the {{amino acid sequence}} of the <b>lid</b> region on interfacial binding and <b>lid</b> dynamics of TLL. Three TLL variants were investigated, a wild-type variant, a variant containing an esterase <b>lid</b> region (Esterase), and a Hybrid variant, containing both wild-type <b>lid</b> residues and esterase <b>lid</b> residues. Multiple coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the interfacial binding orientation of TLL was significantly affected {{by the nature of}} amino acids in the <b>lid</b> region, and atomistic simulations indicated effects on the structural dynamics of the <b>lid</b> itself. The atomistic simulations, as well as steered molecular dynamics simulations, also indicated that the Esterase <b>lid</b> region was less flexible than the wild-type <b>lid</b> region, whereas the Hybrid variant displayed superior <b>lid</b> flexibility and stability in the open conformation both at the interface, and in aqueous solution.
