Doctor of Philosophy (Educational Computing), August 2007, 205 pp., 13 tables, 3 figures, references, 179 titles. Innovative educators seek technologies to facilitate or enhance the <b>learning</b> <b>experience</b> <b>while</b> taking nothing away from the message of instruction. Simulations have been shown to meet this requirement.

However, substantive research on their efficacy remains limited. What research has been conducted indicates that simulations possess great potential as aids to instruction.

The results show that the three ethnic groups significantly differ regarding their online network composition. Youth’s narratives also reveal that their online <b>learning</b> <b>experiences</b> are ethno-specific. Youth differ regarding the nature of online communities in which they search for information, make new contacts and distribute their own media creations.
