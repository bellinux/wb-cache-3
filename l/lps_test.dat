40|$|Brucellosis is {{a serious}} {{zoonosis}} that occurs worldwide, and its diagnosis is typically based on the detection of antibodies against Brucella lipopolysaccharide (LPS). However, the specificity of the LPS-based test is compromised by cross-reactivity with Esche-richia coliO 157 :H 7 and Yersinia enterocoliticaO: 9. Also, diagnosis based on the <b>LPS</b> <b>test</b> cannot differentiate between vacci-nated and infected individuals. The detection of the 26 -kDa cytosoluble protein (BP 26) antibody is considered an alternative that circumvents these drawbacks because it is exclusively expressed by infectious Brucella. A BP 26 -based enzyme-linked immu-nosorbent assay (ELISA) has been tried for the diagnosis of Brucella-infected animals and humans, but a few results showed that BP 26 couldn’t react with all Brucella-positive sera. In order to explore whether different animals could produce antibodies against BP 26 after being infected with various Brucella species, we infected sheep, goats, and beef cattle with common virulent reference Brucella species. All sera were collected from the experimental animals and tested using both LPS-based ELISAs and BP 26 -based ELISAs. The results showed that all Brucella-infected individuals could produce high levels of antibodies against LPS, but only B. melitensis 16 M- and B. melitensisM 28 -infected sheep and B. melitensis 16 M- and B. abortus 2308 -infected goats could produce antibodies against BP 26. Therefore, we concluded that the BP 26 -based indirect ELISA (i-ELISA) showed both Brucella species and host specificity, which obviously limits its reliability {{as a substitute for}} the traditional LPS-based ELISA for the detection of brucellosis.

We also raise the awareness, that the difference in typing results obtained by phenotypical methods and genotype based methods may have implications on vaccine surveillance in case a GBS vaccine is introduced. Methods A total of 616 clinical GBS isolates from 2010 to 2014 were tested with both a latex <b>test</b> and the <b>LP</b> <b>test.</b> Among these, 66 isolates were genotyped by PCR, including 41 isolates that were phenotypically NT. Results The latex test provided a serotype for 83. 8 % of the isolates (95 % CI [80. 7 – 86. 6]) compared to 87. 5 % (95 % CI [84. 6 – 90. 0]) obtained by the LP method. The two assays provided identical capsular identification for all sero-typeable isolates (excluding NT isolates). The PCR assay provided a genotype designation to the 41 isolates defined as phenotypically NT isolates. Discussion We found that the latex test showed a slightly lower identification percentage than the <b>LP</b> <b>test.</b> Our recommendation {{is to use the}} latex agglutination as the routine primary assay for GBS surveillance, and then use the more labour intensive precipitation test on the NT isolates to increase the serotyping rate. A genotype could be assigned to all the phenotypically NT isolates, however, as a consequence genotyping will overestimate the coverage from possible future capsular polysaccharide based GBS vaccines...|$|R

In the first step, the standard linear unit root test, namely the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, Phillip-Perron (PP) test and Kwiatkowski-Philllips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test identify the random walk behaviour in the indices. In order to take account the possible breaks in the index series Zivot and Adrews (1992) one break and Lumsdaine and Papell (1997) two breaks unit root test are employed to observe whether the presence of breaks in the data series will prevent the stocks from randomly pricing or vice versa.

Methods: Medical students in their neurological term were invited to participate and were randomly assigned to one of three groups. The control group was offered only the LP simulation course, while the quiz group was offered a theoretical quiz based on the technical performance of a LP directly after they had attended the LP simulation course.

When purified from the bacterial culture, met-hGH is biologically active in established assays for growth hormone. Therefore, a phase I trial of met-hGH {{was carried out in}} healthy human adults; during the first trial, however, signs, symptoms, and clinical laboratory tests characteristic of an acute-phase response to pyrogenic agents was observed. Prior testing of the met-hGH preparation used in the phase I trial did not reveal evidence of toxicity, and the U. S. Pharmacopeial Convention rabbit pyrogen test, as well as the Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) test, had not detected significant levels of exogenous pyrogens or endotoxin. In addition, standard inhibition studies with added endotoxin showed no inhibition by the LAL test. When this preparation of met-hGH was incubated with human blood mononuclear cells, leukocytic pyrogen (LP) was released into the supernatant medium, suggesting that the preparation contained pyrogenic material. Various lots of met-hGH based on different purification and formulating methods were tested by the human LP assay for contaminating pyrogens. The results of these tests aided in the identification of procedures for met-hGH preparations which did not induce LP in vitro. Thus, subsequent lots of met-hGH which had passed the <b>LP</b> <b>test</b> were used in repeat clinical studies, and no inflammatory or pyrogenic reactions were observed. When the <b>LP</b> <b>test</b> was used, experiments revealed that the original lot of met-hGH was contaminated with endotoxin which had not been detected in the LAL or rabbit pyrogen tests. Lyophilization in glycine-phosphate buffer had resulted in a 10 - to 20 -fold reduction of endotoxin reactivity in the LAL test and the U. S. Pharmacopeial Convention rabbit pyrogen test. These data provide a probable explanation for the negative result from the LAL and rabbit pyrogen test in the initial lot of met-hGH which induced acute-phase reactions. In addition, these studies demonstrate that the release of LP from human cells is a reliable indicator of the presence of materials that are pyrogenic for humans...|$|R

After accounting for the two most significant structural breaks in the data impacting on both the intercept and trend (model CC), results from the <b>LP</b> <b>test</b> indicate that the null of at least one unit root is rejected for some of the variables under investigation at the 10 % level or better.

There are limited interventions in this regard. Aim: determining the impact of supportive educational program on the anxiety of mothers whose children are undergoing lumbar puncture (LP). Method: the present study is a randomized controlled clinical trial carried out in 2015. Sixty mothers of children undergoing lumbar puncture and hospitalized 3 educational hospitals of Mashhad, Iran, were randomly divided to control group (n= 30) and intervention group (n= 30). The intervention group received supportive program during a session of 60 min. Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was selected as the research tool. Finally, data were analyzed by Chi-square test, independent t-test using SPSS v. 16 software. Results: The mean age of the mothers was 27. 3 ± 5. 3 and 26. 0 ± 3. 1, respectively. The mean pre-interventions maternal manifest anxiety was 51. 9 ± 6. 2 and 53. 4 ± 4. 3 out of 80, respectively, in the intervention and control groups. The mean post-interventions maternal manifest anxiety was 44. 9 ± 5. 1 and 52. 7 ± 4. 2, respectively, in the intervention and control groups. According to the results of independent t-test, significant difference was observed statistically for the mean maternal manifest anxiety between the two groups (p> 0. 001). Implications for Practice: Regarding the reduction of maternal anxiety in the intervention group, which is possible because of the attention to the emotional needs of mothers, in addition to proper training; this program can be considered as an effective method to reduce maternal anxiety before the <b>LP</b> <b>test...</b>|$|R
40|$|Local Tb theorems with <b>Lp</b> type <b>testing</b> conditions, {{which are}} not scale invariant, have been studied widely {{in the case of}} the Lebesgue measure. In the non-homogeneous world local Tb theorems have only been proved {{assuming}} scale invariant (L^∞ or BMO) testing conditions. In this paper, for the first time, we overcome these obstacles in the non-homogeneous world, and prove a non-homogeneous local Tb theorem with L 2 type testing conditions. This paper is in the setting of the vertical and conical square functions defined using general measures and kernels. The proof uses various recent innovations including a Whitney averaging formula and the insertion of a Calderon-Zygmund stopping data of a fixed function in to the construction of the twisted martingale difference operators.
