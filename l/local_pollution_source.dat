40|$|This {{study is}} the first to present data on local (=beach) and gamma {{diversity}} of beach nematode assemblages from the Persian Gulf. We investigated four beaches near the city of Bandar Abbas, Iran. On each beach, we sampled three stations at 50 -m intervals, with increasing distance from a <b>local</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>source,</b> mostly domestic sewage. A total of 39 genera from 17 families was recorded. This gamma diversity is low and suggests that the entire area experiences substantial stress. Five genera together comprised 75 % of nematode abundance. There were significant differences in abundance as well as genus diversity between locations, but these did not unequivocally correlate with known drivers of benthic assemblage structure like sediment granulometry and hydrodynamics. The location exposed to the strongest local pollution input had the lowest nematode diversity and a very low abundance at the station nearest the pollution source. Distance from local pollution sources also significantly impacted genus diversity, but this pattern was only pronounced in two of the four beaches. Our data demonstrate that local sources of anthropogenic disturbance are a major driver of assemblage diversity and structure in this area, despite an overarching effect of natural (salinity, temperature) and anthropogenic stressors...|$|E

40|$|Event rain {{samples were}} {{collected}} at three sites in eastern Canada {{in an attempt to}} characterize the sources of sulphate in precipitation utilizing the isotopic signatures of sulphur and oxygen. Both continental and marine sites were chosen providing an opportunity to compare these different environments. Sulphur isotopes are useful tools for source tracing because they undergo little fractionation subsequent to emission to the atmosphere. Oxygen isotopes are useful for examining processes of oxidation which occur during transport and deposition of sulphur. A unique feature of this study is the incorporation of trace metal and meteorological data along with isotopic evidence to further aid source identification. [...] Three sites were chosen for this study representing marine/urban (St. John's, NF), marine/rural (Seal Cove, NF), and continental/rural (Nepean, ON) environments. The sulphur isotopic results at both marine sites are best described by two end-member mixing between a seaspray end-member (+ 21 %o) and a low δ³⁴S end-member (≈ + 5 %o). The low δ³⁴S end-member likely represents a mixture of long-range transported continental and local anthropogenic sources. Oxygen values also reflect a seaspray end-member (+ 9. 5 %o) and a continental end-member (+ 10 to + 12 %o), however the St. John's data contain a significant ¹⁸O-enriched pollution input. Despite its proximity to a thermal generating station, the Seal Cove site is apparently free from a strong <b>local</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>source,</b> but some locally oxidized secondary sulphate is evident from the correlation between δ¹⁸Oso₄ and δ¹⁸OH₂o. The Nepean site has a very different character because of its continental nature. It exhibits a constant isotopic signature with an average δ³⁴S value of + 4. 4 %o and an average δ¹⁸Oso₄ value of + 14. 7 %o. Local oxidation is not important at this site. Since the region is relatively unpolluted, primary sulphates must have been transported from other areas. The average δ³⁴S value for Nepean {{is the same as the}} low δ³⁴S end-members of St. John's and Seal Cove, suggesting that eastern North America may be the source of the continental/anthropogenic signal seen at the coastal sites. [...] A significant contribution of this study has been the measurement of extremely high δ¹⁸Oso₄ values (+ 42 %o) at St. John's, much higher than those measured in other studies. These ¹⁸O-enriched sulphates are in samples with elevated metal concentrations (Ni, V, Mo, Co, Cu, Mn) and represent primary sulphates formed by the high temperature processes associated with combustion in the power plant located near the site. Previous researchers predicted that primary sulphates would exhibit extremely high oxygen isotopic compositions, and this work is the first to confirm this in natural rain samples. [...] This investigation has provided insight on how interaction between long-range transported continental, marine and local sulphur sources defines the character of individual sites. It has also demonstrated how isotopic and chemical data can be successfully combined to give a complete picture of the sources of sulphur affecting a particular...|$|E

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) plays a {{key role}} in tropospheric photo-chemistry. The {{photochemical}} oxidation of hydrocarbons, for example, can serve as either a source or a sink for ozone, depending on the local abundance of NO. Nitric oxide also helps govern atmospheric concentrations of the hydroxyl (OH) radical. The OH radical is the single most important player in photochemical transformations because it controls the atmospheric lifetimes of so many chemical species. Although NO serves as a very effective catalyst in many important chemical processes, its concentration is low enough to normally be expressed in units of parts per trillion by volume (pptv).

The study of river sediments, however, is complicated by changes of channel morphology and sedimentation dynamics and redeposition of old sediments, whether caused naturally (flood events) or by human impact (land use changes or building of water management structures), which leads to deposition of various sedimentary facies. Identification of sedimentary facies within floodplain fill is hence necessary - character (lithology) of deposited facies influences the spatial distribution of pollutants within floodplains.

In this work we investigate a severe SO 2 episode observed on 3 – 5 February 2002 in a coastal industrial town of Rijeka, Croatia, where very high daily mean concentrations (up to 353. 5 μg m − 3) were measured. The episode occurred under high air pressure conditions, which were accompanied with a fog and low wind speeds. Three air quality models (50 -km EMEP model, 10 -km EMEP 4 HR model and 1 -km CAMx model) were used to simulate SO 2 concentrations fields and to evaluate the relative contribution of distant and <b>local</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>sources</b> to observed concentrations.

Furthermore, using three-dimensional, higher-order turbulence closure mesoscale meteorological model (WRF), the wind regimes and thermo-dynamical structure of the lower troposphere above the greater Rijeka area (GRA) were examined in detail. Modelled atmospheric fields suggest several factors whose simultaneous acting was responsible for elevated SO 2 concentrations.

40|$|We report here an {{assessment}} of sources and inputs of organic and inorganic pollutants to the Doñana National Park (SW Spain), {{one of the finest}} wetlands in Europe. In the absence of <b>local</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>sources,</b> the occurrence and distribution of heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Pb), organochlorine compounds (DDT and PCBs) and hydrocarbons (both natural and anthropogenic) in different biotic and abiotic compartments of the park are explained in terms of transport processes related to geographical, hydrological and biological factors. In this respect, it has been recognised that drainage waters from the northern opencast-worked polymetallic sulphide deposits constitute a chronic input of heavy metals into the park. Waste waters from olive-oil manufacturing mills in the area may also contribute to the mobilisation of metals towards the park. However, the resulting relative distributions of Zn, Cu and Pb within the park differ from those of mine effluents, indicating a differential transport of these metals through the water systems. Zinc seems to be the best indicator of input from the mining area. Petroleum hydrocarbons enter the park from the SE via the main rivers and tidal sea movements, whereas PAHs, PCBs and DDTs are uniformly distributed at very low levels in surface sediments, indicating a contribution by aeolian transport. Evidence of inefficient recycling of organic matter in the shallow ponds is obtained by the identification of well preserved natural products from local plants and chemical markers of denitrifying bacteria (cyanobacterial markers). Financial support of CAICYT and CSIC is greatfully acknowledged. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Årsliste 2000 The International Cooperative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Acidification of Rivers and Lakes (ICP Waters) is {{designed}} to assess the degree and geographical extent of acidification of surface waters, evaluate dose/response relationships and long-term trends in aquatic chemistry and biota. The aim of the 12 -year report is to provide an overall synthesis and assessment of information on water chemistry and biology accumulated in the ICP Waters Programme within the last 3 years (1996 - 98) related to previous findings. The report includes {{an evaluation of the}} ICP Waters database and the representativeness of ICP Waters sites, long-term trends in water chemistry at the single ICP sites and on regional scales, characterisation of invertebrates on a regional scale and an assessment of heavy metals. The current ICP Waters database includes only active sites well suited to monitor changes in acidification in response to changes in acid deposition. In the 10 -year periode 1989 - 1998, sulphate concentrations showed significant downward trends while nitrate concentrations showed no regional patterns of change. pH and ANC and also DOC have increased in most regions during the past 10 years.

40|$|Abstract A 12 months {{study on}} urban {{atmospheric}} concentrations of {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAH) contained in the particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter {{less than or equal}} to 10 microns (PM 10) was carried out in Zaragoza (Spain) from July 12 th, 2001 to July 26 th, 2002 by using a high-volume air sampler able to collect the PAH supported on a Teflon-coated fibre glass filter. Samples were analysed by using Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). PAH of high molecular weight, indeno[1, 2, 3 -cd]pyrene (IcdP), benzo[g,h,i]perylene (BghiP) and coronene (Co) were the most abundant compounds. The concentrations of benz[a]pyrene equivalent carcinogenic power (BaP-eq) showed a mean value of 0. 7 ng/m 3 with 22. 5 % of the samples exceeding the 1. 0 ng/m 3 guide value established by the European Directive. These episodes were mainly produced during cold season. Regarding meteorological variables, a positive effect of the prevalent wind “cierzo” (NW direction) over the Zaragoza city was confirmed from the environmental point of view. The NE, E and S directions, corresponding to highway and industrial areas were the directions showing the high PAH atmospheric concentrations. Despite the proximity of a high-level traffic highway, stationary sources related to industry were the dominant source of PAH in the sampled area. Vehicular emissions and natural gas home heating also contributed to PAH concentrations. The predominance of <b>local</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>sources</b> versus long-range transport on PAH concentrations was shown. However, the contribution of long-range transport of anthropogenic origin from other European areas was reflected for specific dates on PAH concentrations and PM 10 levels. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Due to its {{geographical}} peculiarities, the Republic of Maldives {{represents a}} case study of great interest for the investigation of persistent organic pollutants, from both a socio-economic and an ecological perspective. Thus, we conducted a first survey to assess the current status of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD), polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDF) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyl (DL-PCB) concentrations in Maldivian soils. The range for PCDD/F and DL-PCB soil concentrations was 0. 01 – 49. 3 pg WHO 2005 -TEQ g− 1 and 0. 01 – 3. 69 pg WHO 2005 -TEQ g− 1 dw respectively. PCDD/F concentrations exceeding several international soil guidelines were found in samples from locations in the proximity of local waste combustion sources. DL-PCB concentrations were lower than PCDD/Fs and comparable to those in previous reports from background areas and in areas with developing industrial and agricultural activities. PCDD/F and DL-PCB levels (expressed as WHO 2005 -TEQ) in soils were strongly correlated (r = 0. 89), which suggests that, in most of the sites, they are originated from the same emission sources. Results indicate that PCDD/F soil concentrations (expressed as WHO 2005 -TEQ) tend to decrease with the distance from the <b>local</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>sources.</b> Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that PCDD/Fs in the most polluted locations are mainly generated by waste combustion. These findings highlight the need for immediate changes in waste management policies in the Archipelago, {{in order to reduce the}} release of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) in the fragile local environment.

40|$|The Region of Western Macedonia in Greece {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{polluted}} areas in Europe due to large lignite ¿ fired power plants with total installed capacity of approx. 4500 MW. The determination of emissions and emission factors for the region is an essential part of the EU-supported project SMAQ, aimed at developing methods for optimizing pollution abatement plans and for early warning of extreme pollution incidents. Using various data sources and the CORINAIR methodology, emissions and local emission factors have been estimated for the main industrial and non-industrial activities in that region. Biogenic sources such as animal husbandry and agricultural activities have been examined as well. The particular source sectors examined include power plants, lignite mining, road transport, central heating systems and agriculture. Calculated emission factors are based on data from the <b>local</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>sources,</b> while default values from CORINAIR or other sources are used to fill existing data gaps. An emissions inventory concerning major pollutants (PM, SO 2, NOx, CO, N 2 O, VOC, CH 4, NH 3) was compiled for the period 2001 ¿ 2004. As expected, the most significant pollutants are SO 2 and NOx, followed by PM and CO, emitted from power plants. However, CO emissions due to road transportation are also quite significant. The information obtained is considered fairly complete and it is currently being used in conjunction with other data, model results as well as satellite images to develop a novel integrated system for efficient monitoring, assessment and management of air pollution in the Region of Western Macedonia.

40|$|Data from {{multiple}} satellite remote sensors are integrated with ground measurements and meteorological data {{to study the}} impact of Greek forest fires in August 2007 on the air quality in Athens. Two pollution episodes were identified by ground PM In measurements between August 23 and September 4. In the first episode, Evia and Peloponnese fires contributed substantially to the air pollution levels in Athens. In the second episode, transport of industrial pollution from Italy and Western Europe as well as forest fires in Albania contributed substantially to the air pollution levels in Athens. <b>Local</b> air <b>pollution</b> <b>sources</b> {{also contributed to the}} observed particle levels during these episodes. Satellite data provide valuable insights into the spatial distribution of particle concentrations, thus they can be used identify <b>pollution</b> <b>sources.</b> In spite of a few weaknesses in current satellite data products identified in this analysis, combining satellite aerosol remote sensing data with trajectory models and ground measurements is a powerful tool to study intensive particle pollution events such as forest fires.

40|$|Integrated {{assessment}} {{of air pollution}} and its impacts typically requires pre-calculated atmospheric transfer relations on a fine spatial resolution. While such concepts have been applied successfully for Europe and other regions with high data coverage, extending calculations to world regions with low local data availability is challenging {{and needs to be}} based on globally available data sets. Here we introduce a scalable approach which has been developed to expand the calculations of health impacts from exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) in the Greenhouse Gas-Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) integrated assessment model to (almost) any desired region on the globe, depending on actual requirements for policy analysis. We use global sensitivity simulations of the EMEP atmospheric chemistry transport model to derive linear transfer coefficients at a resolution of 0. 5 degrees. A major challenge lies in the realistic representation of inner urban PM 2. 5 concentrations, which depend to a large extent on <b>local</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>sources</b> on scales below grid resolution. We derive sub-grid concentration increments from emission densities of primary PM from low-level sources, based on (almost) globally available gridded population data with approximately 100 m resolution. From ambient PM 2. 5 concentrations, increased risk of mortality is then calculated following the methodology of the Global Burden of Disease studies. We have implemented and validated the described approach for India, China, and Indonesia, with extensions to other G- 20 member countries underway. Health impact projections under different energy policy scenarios are discussed. Due to the inherent treatment of urban areas, the effects of urbanization trends are captured explicitly, which lead to higher average population exposure as people move into polluted cities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- From {{a network}} of sites, {{primarily}} in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean regions, measurements of the surface ozone concentration yield information on the seasonal, synoptic, and diurnal patterns. These sites, generally removed {{from the effects of}} <b>local</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>sources,</b> show characteristics that typify broad geographical regions. At Barrow, AK; Mauna Loa, HI; American Samoa; and South Pole, data records of 15 - 20 years show trends that in all cases are a function of season. This dependence on season is important in understanding the causes of the long-term changes. At Barrow, the summer (July, August, September) increase of 1. 7 % per year is probably indicative of photochemical production. At South Pole, on the other hand, the summer (December, January, Ftbruary) decrease is related to photochemical losses and enhanced transport from the coast of Antarctica. At all the sites there is a pronounced seasonal variation. In the Southern Hemisphere (SH), all locations which run from 14 to 900 S show a winter (July-August) maximum and summer minimum. In the Northern Hemisphere (NH) most of the sites show a spring maximum and autumn minimum. At Barrow (700 N) and Barbados (141, however, the maxima occur during the winter, but for very different reasons. At many of the sites, the transport changes associated with synoptic scale weather patterns dominate the day-to-day variability. This is particularly pronounced at Bermuda and the more tropical sites. In the tropics, there is a very regular diurnal surface ozone cycle with minimum values in the afternoon and maxima early in the morning. This appears to result from photochemical destruction during the day in regions with very lo...|$|R
