40|$|Abstract Live organisms intercepted from treated com-modities during {{phytosanitary}} inspections usually arouse {{suspicions of}} treatment failure, sub-standard treatment application, or post-treatment infestation. The additional {{possibility that some}} treatments could kill slowly, meaning commodities might be inspected before pests have suc-cumbed, is seldom considered for treatments other than irradiation. We used a novel biochemical viability assay to measure delays between methyl bromide fumigation and mortality of dipteran eggs, and evaluated the correspondence between egg viability and egg morphological features. Our experimental conditions simulated shipping of rock melons from Australia to New Zealand by sea and air. No eggs survived fumigation, but they took 3 – 20 days to die, whereas phytosanitary inspections of rock melons occur within 2 – 7 days. Delays were not influenced by methyl bromide concentration, but were significantly lengthened by cooler storage temperatures. Methyl bromide’s preservative effects delayed degradation of egg morphology, so the biochemical assay detected mortality long before morphological signs of egg death appeared. The results show that commodities subjected to effective methyl bromide treatments {{are at risk of}} being inspected before all pests have either died, or started to exhibit morphological signs of death. This could cause commodities to be unnecessarily rejected by quarantine authorities. Better methods than inspection for <b>live</b> <b>pests</b> are needed to assist authorities to gain assurance that treated commodities have been effectively disinfested. These could be developed by exploiting biochemical responses of pests and commodities to treatments...|$|E

30|$|Control methods against mosquitos’ larvae include mechanical, biological, chemical, and an {{integrated}} approach {{where all of}} the above are used (Alten and Çağlar 1998). The chemical control targeted both larvae and adults, but larvae being the important ones. These <b>pests</b> <b>live</b> in water at all stages, except the adult stage. Today, insecticides used as larvicides are of biological origin, but they are very limited in number. Because of the environmental problems caused by insecticides and the effects of non-target organisms, alternative methods of combating these pests are sought. For a sustainable environment, the importance of biological control is increasing among these applications. But unfortunately, the high price of these biological agents at the moment makes it difficult for their broader implementation in the systems of production (Laznik and Trdan 2011).|$|R

5|$|A {{potential}} {{obstacle to}} the adoption of biological pest control measures is growers sticking to the familiar use of pesticides. However, pesticides have a variety of undesired effects, including the development of resistance among pests, and the destruction of natural enemies; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests of other species than the ones originally targeted, and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides. One method of increasing grower adoption of biocontrol methods involves letting them learn by doing, for example showing them simple field experiments, enabling them to observe the <b>live</b> predation of <b>pests,</b> or demonstrations of parasitised pests. In the Philippines, early season sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice, but growers were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb' of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting; participation in this resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- On-line Analytical Processing (OLAP) {{is widely}} used in many {{business}} applications to analyze data and to help answer queries in multidimensional data to support the manager in making reasonable decision [23]. This paper describes and builds an OLAP application on database of rice pests by using data warehouse architecture, On-line Analytical Processing and web components. This application supports efficient exploitation of rice pest data warehouses in Horticulture and Plant Protection branch of Tra Vinh province in Viet Nam which is accumulated over the years. To achieve this goal, several tools are used to build successful applications such as SQL Server 2005 to build data warehouse, Analysis Services 2005 to build OLAP multidimensional databases and Microsoft Office Web Components to build the web-based reporting of data. With the results obtained, the application allows users a flexible on-line analysis of data on rice <b>pests</b> <b>live</b> on site. This suggests {{that the use of}} OLAP technology is not only effectively applied to support business applications, but also needed to be strongly applied in informatics systems to support the agricultural sector...|$|R
40|$|Concerns about {{possible}} undesired {{environmental effects of}} transgenic crops have prompted numerous evaluations of such crops. So-called Bt crops receive particular attention because they carry bacteria-derived genes coding for insecticidal proteins that might negatively affect non-target arthropods. Here we show a remarkable positive effect of Bt maize {{on the performance of}} the corn leaf aphid Rhopalosiphum maidis, which in turn enhanced the performance of parasitic wasps that feed on aphid honeydew. Within five out of six pairs that were evaluated, transgenic maize lines were significantly more susceptible to aphids than their near-isogenic equivalents, with the remaining pair being equally susceptible. The aphids feed from the phloem sieve element content and analyses of this sap in selected maize lines revealed marginally, but significantly higher amino acid levels in Bt maize, which might partially explain the observed increased aphid performance. Larger colony densities of aphids on Bt plants resulted in an increased production of honeydew that can be used as food by beneficial insects. Indeed, Cotesia marginiventris, a parasitoid of lepidopteran <b>pests,</b> <b>lived</b> longer and parasitized more pest caterpillars in the presence of aphid-infested Bt maize than in the presence of aphid-infested isogenic maize. Hence, depending on aphid pest thresholds, the observed increased susceptibility of Bt maize to aphids may be either a welcome or an undesirable side effect...|$|R
40|$|Compost {{obtained}} from variable sources {{of raw materials}} such as municipal solid waste, yard trimmings, biosolids, and other organic materials is a widely used soil amendment for agricultural, landscape, mulch and soil mitigation purposes. When this aerobically biodegraded product is appropriately composted and mixed at temperatures of 55 C for 15 days (windrow composting methods) or five days (in-vessel composting methods), it is theoretically free of pathogens including nematode plant pests and weeds. However, improper composting procedures and poor sanitation practices result in incomplete elimination of nematode plant pests and pathogens from the composting material or contamination of the finished product with raw material from the environment. Compost containing <b>live</b> nematode plant <b>pests</b> or weeds can hamper crop production. Additionally, it can spread regulated nematodes in nematode-certified citrus and ornamental nurseries resulting in loss of nematode certification or rejection of plant shipments from regulatory officials. Major factors that prevent the complete elimination of nematode plant pests in compost operations include: i) improper composting procedures such as oversized organic piles or windrows that cannot be turned properly and lack of uniform temperature distribution in the composting material and ii) poor sanitation practices which cause contamination of the compost with nematode plant pests. Proper sanitation requires careful planning to eliminate the risks from the environment due to insufficient engineering of the compost facility, unsanitized machinery or inadvertent mixing of raw material and finished product. Establishment of a well-designed composting facility that implements appropriate composting and sanitation procedures is costly and labor intensive. Typically, such facilities will require subsidization, because the up-front costs of a properly designed and operated facility cannot be recouped by the sale of finished stable product...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Although {{global trade}} is implicated in {{biological}} invasions, {{the assumption that}} trade networks explain the large-scale distributions of non-native species remains largely untested. We addressed this by analysing relationships between global trade networks and plant pest invasion. Location: Forty-eight countries in Europe and the Mediterranean. Time period: Current. Major taxa studied: Four hundred and twenty-two non-native plant pests (173 invertebrates, 166 pathogens, 83 plants). Methods: Ten types of connectivity index were developed, representing potential roles of trade networks, air transport links, geographical proximity, climatic similarity and source country wealth in facilitating invasion. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) identified the connectivity index that best explained both historical and recent invasion. Then, more complex GLMMs were developed including connectivity through trade networks for multiple commodities relevant for <b>pests</b> (<b>live</b> plants, forest products, fruit and vegetables and seeds) and species’ transport associations with those commodities. Results: Total import volumes, species’ global prevalence and connectivity measures based on air transport, geographical distance or climate did not explain invasion as well as connectivity through global trade networks. Invasion was strongly promoted by agricultural imports from countries in which the focal species was present and that were climatically similar to the importing country. However, live plant imports from nearby countries provided a better explanation {{of the most recent}} invasions. Connectivity through multiple trade networks predicted invasion better than total agricultural trade, and there was support for our hypothesis that species known to be transported with a particular network had greater sensitivity to its connectivity. Main conclusions: Our findings show that patterns of invasion are governed to a large extent by global trade networks connecting source areas for non-native species and the dispersal of those species through multiple trade networks. This enhances potential for developing a predictive framework to improve risk assessment, biosecurity and surveillance for invasions...|$|R
40|$|Preventing pest plagues Cue: Insect pests {{are one of}} the {{greatest}} dangers to a cotton crop. Preventing the spread and build up of pests is therefore {{one of the most important}} aspects of cotton production, both for the individual farmer, and for cotton producing countries as a whole. Farmers have a key role to play in fighting pests at the end of the season, after the cotton crop has been harvested. This is the time when cotton plants should be uprooted and burnt. Governments may also guard against cotton pests, for example through laws which prevent the importing of unchecked cotton seed. To find out more about the battle against cotton pests, Excello Zidana spoke to Dr Mackson Banda, Deputy Director of Agricultural Research in Malawi. He began by asking Dr Banda whether the chemical pesticides commonly used on cotton plants are safe for the environment. IN:		?These chemicals are safe? OUT:		? in the interest of the whole nation. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 12 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr Mackson Banda on some of the mechanisms being used in Malawi to control both cotton pests, and pesticide use. Transcript Banda	These chemicals are safe to the environment if they are used judiciously. By judiciously I mean they should only be used when there is need to do so. But if you just use them indiscriminately you will pollute the environment. You will kill a lot of insects or even animals in the environment because these are poisonous. We must accept it, it is a fact. Zidana	Now others talk of cultural practices trying to eradicate or eliminate or reduce pests and diseases in the cotton fields. Do you agree with that statement? Banda		Yes I do agree. Zidana		What are some of these cultural practices? Banda	Some of the cultural practices: first and foremost is crop hygiene. Where you have grown cotton this year you must make sure that all the crop residues are uprooted, burnt. Because if you don?t do that some of these pests over-winter through this crop debris. So crop hygiene is one of the very important things. Plus early cultivation of the land, because some <b>pests</b> <b>live</b> in the ground, in the soil. They will form a cocoon and survive. But when you dig the soil you expose those which have been buried in the ground to the sunshine and then you disturb their life cycle. So this is very important in cotton production. Zidana	Extension workers advise farmers to uproot the cotton stalks soon after harvesting. How good is that practice? Banda	This is very good because if you have travelled to all cotton growing areas, if you leave cotton plants in the field you find these even late pests like cotton stainers flying all over the place. Now if you cut all these or you uproot all the cotton plants, you burn them, you reduce the breeding ground for these particular things. And then as you start the new season, you start with a fresh season, and a fresh crop, so that if there are any pests coming they should be coming within that season but not coming from one season to another. That would develop a bomb for the cotton crop. Zidana	Now there are some diseases and even pests that spread from region to region, country to country. Are there special rules to maybe check the spread of diseases of cotton? Banda	Yes we have a Cotton Act in the country which prohibits imports of unauthorised cotton varieties into the country. This is done first in the interest of protecting the crop from pests from other countries, even diseases being imported through seeds. So the government here has this Act which is in force so that we don?t just receive seed from elsewhere without proper verification of the phyto-sanitary, and sanitary measures that were taken in the place of production. So the law is there, it protects the farmer, it protects the economy, it protects the cotton industry so that it continues to flourish. Zidana	How do you look at the use of chemicals as opposed to the cultural practices in cotton production? Banda	Well at the moment we can say is, we don?t have a single method of controlling pests in cotton. What we are advocating at the moment is Integrated Pest Management. By Integrated Pest Management we mean use of cultural practices, use of improved varieties, use of chemicals where necessary, plus also crop hygiene, uprooting of stalks. Combining these is what we call Integrated Pest Management, so that no single method is the superior in pest management. We have to combine these methods in an integrated manner. Then it will be friendly to the environment. But if we just advocate chemical use, we will pollute the environment. Zidana	Now lastly how do you work with the companies producing and selling chemicals in the country? Banda	There is a law, there is the Cotton Act which is a binding thing. And we work in close liaison with all stakeholders in the cotton industry. This includes chemical manufacturers or sellers, ginners, cotton ginners, those who do bailing of cotton, those who do exporting of cotton, whoever is working on cotton we work with them. But the rule of thumb is that, if let?s say a chemical company wants to introduce a pesticide in the country, they have to come to the Ministry of Agriculture and apply and we have a committee which is called Agricultural Technology Clearing Committee which looks at the pesticides. So our scientists have to analyse that particular pesticide, evaluate it in the field, generate information under our local conditions and then be satisfied that it can work under our local conditions. Then we release it, officially release it, ask them to sell it in Malawi. We don?t just allow any importation of any junk to be sold on our soils because we are cautious, we need to protect the farmer. Zidana	I have also heard about the Pesticide Control Board. How serious is this Board? Banda	The Pesticide Control Board is very serious because if there is a banned pesticide they will take an action to say this must not be used on the soils of Malawi. This protects the environment, it protects us as human beings, it protects the natural fauna, the natural environment is protected. So people must realise that this Board is working in the interest of the whole nation. End of track.
