It was released as a mini-album, containing nine tracks written during the six months Simpson and Westaway lived together. Recording sessions were often interrupted, since Simpson {{was in the midst}} of a sold-out series of Wembley shows with Busted.|$|E
5|$|Fightstar are a British post-hardcore {{band from}} London, England that formed in 2003. The band is {{composed}} of lead vocalist, guitarist and keyboardist Charlie Simpson, guitarist and co-vocalist Alex Westaway, bassist Dan Haigh and drummer Omar Abidi. Fightstar are known to incorporate metal, alternative rock, emo and other genres into their general post-hardcore sound. During the band's early days, they were viewed sceptically by critics because of Simpson's former pop career with Busted. Their live shows got a more positive reaction, and their 2005 debut EP, They <b>Liked</b> <b>You</b> Better When You Were Dead, was a critical success.|$|E

500|$|Alongside Seth's It's a Good Life, If You Don't Weaken and Joe Matt's The Poor Bastard—works by Brown's Toronto-based {{friends and}} Drawn and Quarterly stablemates—I Never <b>Liked</b> <b>You</b> {{is seen as}} a {{prominent}} example of the 1990s autobiographical comics trend.

500|$|Brown {{established}} his {{reputation in the}} early alternative comics scene of the 1980s with the surreal, taboo-breaking Ed the Happy Clown. [...] He brought that story {{to an abrupt end}} in 1989 when, excited by the autobiographical comics of Joe Matt and Julie Doucet, he turned towards personal stories. The uncomplicated artwork of his friend and fellow Toronto cartoonist Seth inspired him to simplify his own. [...] Brown intended I Never <b>Liked</b> <b>You</b> as part of a longer work with what became his previous book, The Playboy (1992), but found the larger story too complex to handle at once. I Never <b>Liked</b> <b>You</b> was the last work of Brown's early autobiographical period.|$|E
500|$|Brown's autobiographical work {{developed}} from {{a scene that}} had been developing since the 1970s and which had reached a peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s. [...] Brown's open and self-deprecating example left an impact on cartoonists such as Jeffrey Brown and Ariel Schrag, and his sparse layouts on the likes of Anders Nilsen. [...] Upon the serial's conclusion, reviewer Darcy Sullivan called it [...] "a major step forward for the artist, a leading light in adult comics". [...] American cartoonist Gilbert Hernandez hailed The Playboy and I Never <b>Liked</b> <b>You</b> as [...] "probably the best graphic novels next to Maus"; British cartoonist Eddie Campbell called them [...] "the most sensitive comics ever made"; and American comics writer Heidi MacDonald called I Never <b>Liked</b> <b>You</b> [...] "a masterpiece" [...] that is [...] "the equal of any 'coming of age' movie".|$|E
500|$|The story gained {{praise from}} fans, critics, and other cartoonists, {{and earned a}} Harvey Award {{nomination}} in 1991 for Best Single Issue or Story.

[...] Cartoonist Gilbert Hernandez asserted, [...] "The Playboy and I Never <b>Liked</b> <b>You</b> are probably the best graphic novels next to Maus". [...] Critic Frank Young called it a [...] "pivotal work" [...] in the autobiographical comics trend of the early 1990s. [...] Critic Darcy Sullivan considered it required reading {{for those who are}} serious about comics and a [...] "landmark look at an artist's growth", referring to the pace with which Brown's work matured {{over the course of the}} three issues of its serialization.|$|E

500|$|Drawn and Quarterly {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of the maturation comic books saw in the 1990s, publishing and promoting the works of adult-oriented Canadian and international artists. The publisher avoided genres like superheroes, which publisher Chris Oliveros saw as stifling comics' growth. These comics had artistic aspirations, and graphic novels became increasingly prominent, with Brown's autobiographical [...] and I Never <b>Liked</b> <b>You,</b> and Seth's faux-autobiographical It's a Good Life, If You Don't Weaken garnering considerable attention.|$|E
500|$|I Never <b>Liked</b> <b>You</b> was {{the last}} work from his autobiographical period that started in 1990 with Helder in Yummy Fur #19.

[...] In 2011 Brown returned to autobiography and his relations with women with the graphic novel Paying for It, a polemic arguing for the decriminalization of prostitution.|$|E
500|$|Charles Hatfield praised Brown's honesty, keen observation, and {{narrative}} strength, {{and called the}} [...] "hide with me" [...] page {{as one of his}} favourites.

[...] Brown challenged his own anxieties by tackling subjects such as scatological humour. [...] Imagery such as the recurring Pygmy characters and their [...] "ooga booga" [...] language, Chris Lanier asserted, reinforce [...] "old colonial imaging of 'third world natives'".|$|E
500|$|I Never <b>Liked</b> <b>You</b> {{was well}} received, and its {{influence}} {{can be found in}} the work of cartoonists such as Jeffrey Brown, Ariel Schrag and Anders Nilsen. The book appeared amid the early 1990s trend in autobiographical alternative comics, and Brown was one of a prominent trio of Toronto-based autobiographical cartoonists, with Seth and Joe Matt. Brown originally set the panels against black page backgrounds, which he replaced with white for an annotated [...] "New Definitive Edition" [...] in 2002.|$|E
500|$|The Playboy forms part of Brown's early-1990s autobiographical period, and was {{the first}} book-length work he planned as a {{complete}} story.

In addition, he married his longtime girlfriend and lost over sixty pounds through portion control and exercise. Stump blew through most of his savings putting together a large band to tour behind Soul Punk, but ticket sales were sparse and the album stalled commercially. During a particularly dark moment in February 2012, Stump poured his heart out in a 1500-word blog entry called [...] "We <b>Liked</b> <b>You</b> Better Fat: Confessions of a Pariah." [...] In the post, Stump lamented the harsh reception of the record and his status as a [...] "has-been" [...] at 27.

500|$|I Never <b>Liked</b> <b>You</b> is {{a graphic}} novel by Canadian {{cartoonist}} Chester Brown. [...] The story first ran between 1991 and 1993 {{under the title}} Fuck, in issues [...] of Brown's comic book Yummy Fur; published in book form by Drawn and Quarterly in 1994. [...] It deals with the teenage Brown's introversion and difficulty talking to others, especially members of the opposite sex—including his mother, to whom {{he is unable to}} express affection even as she lies dying in the hospital. [...] The story has minimal dialogue and is sparsely narrated. [...] The artwork is amongst the simplest in Brown's body of work—some pages consist only of a single small panel.|$|E
500|$|Brown had {{switched}} publishers to the Montreal-based Drawn and Quarterly {{by the time}} he completed his first autobiographical graphic novel, The Playboy, in 1992.

[...] The Playboy deals with Brown's guilt over his teenage obsession with masturbating over pornography. [...] The book gained praise from fans, critics, and other cartoonists, and won a Harvey Award. It received criticism from those who saw it as objectifying women and glorifying pornography; [...] Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner wrote to Brown voicing concern that Brown would feel such guilt in a post-sexual revolution world.|$|E
