60|$|All right, I'll be careful. But {{while we}} are--er--on this subject, there's {{something}} I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> you about.|$|E
6000|$|PRESS. [Cheerfully] Miss Stokes, {{would you}} kindly tell Lord William I'm {{here from the}} Press, and would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> him? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you come}} into the dining-room, Dryland?" [...] said the Vicar, with a certain solemnity. [...] "Mrs Jackson would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> you." ...|$|E
60|$|Vincent {{watched the}} list of {{advertisements}} of slaves to be sold, and {{a day or two}} later saw a notice to the effect that Dinah Moore, age twenty-two, with a male baby at her breast, would be sold on the following Saturday. He mounted his horse and rode into Richmond. He had not <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> his mother on the subject, for she had not told him of the letter she had written to Jackson; and he thought that she might disapprove of any interference in the matter, consequently he went down to Mr. Renfrew, the family solicitor.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I won't; but Margaret, I {{must tell}} you once for all {{that that is not}} the way in which I <b>like</b> you <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> me. Why you should have so much less {{confidence}} in my judgment than other people in Baslehurst, I cannot conceive; but--" ...|$|R
60|$|A man {{lay on a}} pile of new-made hay, in a great barn, {{looking up}} at the {{swallows}} who darted and twittered above him. He envied the cheerful little creatures; for he wasn't a happy man, though he had many friends, much money, and the beautiful gift of writing songs that everybody loved to sing. He had lost his wife and little child, and would not be comforted; but lived alone, and went about with such a gloomy face that no one <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> him. He took no notice of friends and neighbors; neither used his money for himself nor others; found no beauty in the world, no happiness anywhere; and wrote such sad songs it made one's heart ache to sing them.|$|R
60|$|The {{meal was}} about half {{finished}} {{when one of}} the waiters came to Dick and said the chauffeur would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] said Leonard. [...] "As Mr. Thomson is not available, {{perhaps you}} will tell Mr. Turner that a gentleman would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Arthur," [...] he said, {{addressing}} his nephew, [...] "you {{had better}} start on your round. I dare say Sir Everard would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> me privately." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have never}} <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> of it <b>to</b> {{anybody in the}} office,' said Mr Waller, 'but I, too, am heart and soul in the movement.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shirley, Shirley, I {{should have}} <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> one word <b>to</b> {{him before he}} went," [...] she murmured, while the tears {{gathered}} glittering in her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{has always}} {{seemed to me that}} a--when a woman has <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> a man she should do so as frankly as she would <b>like</b> him <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> her, and as freely. Leonard, I--I,' as she halted, a sudden idea, winged with {{possibilities}} of rescuing procrastination came to her. She went on more easily: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I shall {{return to}} the hotel. When you have {{arranged}} your financial transactions with your--friend, I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> you. You will find me in my room.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A very intelligent-looking officer, I am sure," [...] Mr. Fentolin remarked. [...] "Gerald, go {{and meet}} him, if you please. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> him out here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} have it left to me!" [...] cried Mrs. Bowen. [...] "It is hard enough, at any rate. Do you think I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> you?" ...|$|E
40|$|I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> commend {{and thank}} the conference {{organizers}} for allowing an “outsider ” <b>like</b> myself <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> you {{today about the}} National Research Council (NRC) report {{on the future of}} the land grant colleges of agriculture (LGCAs). Despite my “outsider ” credentials, I had the pleasure of serving as a member of that NR...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I say! I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> a word <b>to</b> you, Mr Gills, if you please,' said Toots at length, with {{surprising}} presence of mind. 'I say! Miss D.O.M. you know!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> learn <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> French," [...] said I, for I {{had been}} much irritated at not {{understanding}} what was said in the streets.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Derringham, don't you {{remember}} me?" [...] asked Jack Ness. [...] "I {{used to buy}} herbs and watercress from you. I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> you for a minute." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{think about}} it as you do,' she said gravely. 'But I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> my brother of what has happened. We {{will go back to}} Milan.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you do me}} {{the favor}} {{to come down to}} my room for a moment, Mr. Courage?" [...] he begged. [...] "I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> you in private." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Longdon {{turned from}} his contemplation with a visible effort. [...] "I {{feel obliged to}} you for taking it so; it mightn't--one never knows--have amused you. As I told you there, the first thing I did was to ask Fernanda about the company; and when she {{mentioned}} your name I immediately said: 'Would he <b>like</b> me <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> him?'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is he in? I'd <b>like</b> {{very much}} <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> him. I am {{sure he would}} let us have {{something}} to eat," [...] went on Jack in the smoothest tone he could command.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I am not angry, {{except with}} {{the ways of}} the world. I do <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> as if I had common-sense. I really often feel as if I could {{understand}} a little more than I ever hear even from young gentlemen who have been to college." [...] Mary had recovered, and she spoke with a suppressed rippling under-current of laughter pleasant to hear.|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way, Mr. Appleby, I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> you {{in private}} for a moment," [...] went on Dave, and leaping ashore {{he drew the}} manager to one side.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{came down}} here, and I was afeard, and I went back; but I didn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> her, {{because of the}} gentleman, and I came on here again." ...|$|E
6000|$|Rowan hesitated. [...] "Perhaps {{you will}} kindly tell her, {{when she is}} disengaged," [...] he said, [...] "that her brother is here, and would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> her for a moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{might do}} it if he thought that he were {{interfered}} with. Of course I should <b>like</b> my uncle <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> him, but not quite immediately. If he were {{to say that he}} had changed his mind, what could I do, or what could my uncle do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|My {{boy would}} have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> a fireman, {{but he never}} dared; and the foreman of the Neptune, which was the larger and feebler of the engines, was a figure of such worshipful splendor in his eyes that {{he felt as if}} he could not be just a common human being. He was a storekeeper, to begin with, and he was tall and slim, and his black {{trousers}} fitted him like a glove; he had a patent-leather helmet, and a brass speaking-trumpet, and he gave all his orders through this. It did not make any difference how close he was to the men, he shouted everything through the trumpet; and when they manned the brakes and began to pump, he roared at them, [...] "Down on her, down on her, boys!" [...] so that you would have thought the Neptune could put out the world if it was burning up. Instead of that there was usually a feeble splutter from the nozzle, and sometimes none at all, even if the hose did not break; it was fun to see the hose break.|$|R
6000|$|This {{woman had}} a way of tyrannizing over Major Dobbin (for the weakest of all people will domineer over somebody), and she ordered him about, and patted him, and made him fetch and carry just as if he was a great Newfoundland dog. He <b>liked,</b> so <b>to</b> <b>speak,</b> <b>to</b> jump into the water if she said [...] "High, Dobbin!" [...] and to trot behind her with her {{reticule}} in his mouth. This history has been written to very little purpose if the reader has not perceived that the Major was a spooney.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Aye, but Waterloo's the {{favourite}} bridge {{for making}} {{holes in the}} water from,' returned Pea. 'By the bye - avast pulling, lads! - would you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> Waterloo on the subject?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr. St. Cleeve,' {{he said in}} {{a strange}} voice, 'I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> you privately, before I leave, to-morrow morning. Can you meet me--let me see--in the churchyard, at half-past ten o'clock?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{matter is}} in the hands of my police," [...] he said, [...] "but if you could excuse me for half a moment, Lord Maltenby, I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> your head chauffeur." ...|$|E
5000|$|Slobodskaya had a rich, {{strongly}} accented speaking {{voice and}} a characterful turn of phrase, and <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> give <b>spoken</b> introductions <b>to</b> her songs. This led {{to one of her}} last, great successes, in the speaking role of Narrator in [...] "Peter and the Wolf", recording date unknown and released on Fidelio records in 1964 with the Colonne Concerts Orchestra under Isaie Disenhaus.|$|R
6000|$|I flew <b>like</b> {{lightning}} downstairs <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> her, but {{was soon}} damped with her news. [...] "Is the prince alive or dead, Amy?" [...] says I. She spoke coldly and slightly. [...] "He is alive, madam," [...] said she. [...] "But {{it is not}} much matter; I had as lieu he had been dead." [...] So we went upstairs again to my chamber, and there we began a serious discourse of the whole matter.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is the old}} system," [...] {{she pointed}} out firmly. [...] "It {{is for you to}} {{introduce}} a new one. If necessary, you must stoop to political cunning. You should make use of those very factions until you are strong enough to stand by yourself. Through their enmity amongst themselves, one of them would come to your side, anyway. But I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see you discard all old parliamentary methods. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see you <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> the heart of the man who is going to record his vote." ...|$|R
