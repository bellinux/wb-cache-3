In early 2006, however, Palocci had to resign as finance minister due to his involvement in an abuse of power scandal.

Mantega, a former Marxist who had written a PhD thesis (in Sociology) on the history of economic ideas in Brazil from a left-wing viewpoint, was known for his criticism of high interest rates, something he claimed satisfied banking interests.

500|$|Historically, Altrincham was {{a market}} {{town and the}} two main areas of {{employment}} were agriculture and market trade. Although the town went into decline in the 15th century, it recovered and the annual fairs lasted until the mid-19th century and the market still continues. During the Industrial Revolution, Altrincham grew as an industrial town, particularly the Broadheath area, which was developed into an industrial estate. In 1801 there were four cotton mills in Altrincham, part of its textile industry, although they had closed by the 1851 census. The decline of the textile industry in Altrincham mirrored {{the decline of the}} industry in the Trafford area {{as a result of a}} lack of investment and the development of more established industrial areas such as Manchester, Ashton-under-Lyne, and Oldham. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, heavier industries moved into Broadheath, providing local employment. The area steadily declined during the second half of the 20th century, with employment at Broadheath falling from 8,000 to 5,000 between 1960 and 1970. Despite the presence of retailers such as Tesco, Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer in the town, a new Asda superstore in Broadheath, and redevelopment schemes costing over £100million, Altrincham's 15.5per cent <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> in retail is below the national average of 16.9per cent. Altrincham, with its neighbours Bowdon and Hale, is said to constitute a [...] "stockbroker belt", with well-appointed dwellings in an area of [...] opulence.|$|E
40|$|A key finding {{to emerge}} from {{this study is that}} the widely studied {{suburbanization}} or decentralization <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> and population {{is only part of the}} story of postwar urban evolution. Another important part of the story is a postwar trend of relatively faster growth of jobs and people in the smaller and less-dense MSAs (deconcentration). The authors find that postwar growth in employment (and to a lesser extent population) has favored metropolitan areas with smaller <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> (population) density. These trends are shared by major regions of the country and by manufacturing and non-manufacturing employment. The fact that employment growth has favored MSAs with smaller <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> (or lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> density) indicates that economic processes favoring convergent (as opposed to parallel) metropolitan growth played an important role in the postwar era.

2500|$|While free {{movement}} of workers was central to the first European Economic Community agreement, the development of European labour law has been a gradual process. Originally, the Ohlin Report of 1956 recommended that labour standards {{did not need to}} be harmonised, although a general principle of anti-discrimination between men and women was included in the early Treaties. Increasingly, the absence of labour rights was seen as inadequate given the capacity for a [...] "race to the bottom" [...] in international trade if corporations can shift jobs and production to countries with low wages. Today, the EU is required under TFEU article 147 to contribute to a [...] "high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> by encouraging cooperation between Member States". This has not resulted in legislation, which usually requires taxation and fiscal stimulus for significant change, while the European Central Bank's monetary policy has been acutely controversial during the Eurozone crisis. Under article 153(1), the EU is able to use the ordinary legislation procedure on a list of labour law fields. This notably excludes wage regulation and collective bargaining. Generally, four main fields of EU regulation of labour rights touch (1) individual labour rights, (2) anti-discrimination regulations, (3) rights to information, consultation, and participation at work, and (4) rights to job security. In virtually all cases, the EU follows the principle that member states can always create rights more beneficial to workers. This is because the fundamental principle of labour law is that employees' unequal bargaining power justifies substitution of rules in property and contract with positive social rights so that people may earn a living to fully participate in a democratic society. The EU's competences generally follow principles codified in the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers 1989, introduced in the [...] "social chapter" [...] of the Treaty of Maastricht. Initially the UK had opted-out, because of opposition by the Conservative Party, but was acceded to when the Labour Party won the 1997 general election in the Treaty of Amsterdam.|$|E
