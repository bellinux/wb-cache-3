60|$|The burrows {{of worms}} run down perpendicularly {{or a little}} obliquely, and where the soil is at all argillaceous, there is no {{difficulty}} in believing that the walls would slowly flow or slide inwards during very wet weather. When, however, the soil is sandy or mingled with many small stones, it can hardly be viscous enough to flow inwards during even the wettest weather; but another agency may here come into play. After much rain the ground swells, and as it cannot expand laterally, the surface rises; during dry weather it sinks again. For instance, a large flat stone laid {{on the surface of}} a field sank 3.33 mm. whilst the weather was dry between May 9th and June 13th, and rose 1.91 mm, between September 7th and 19th of the same year, much rain having fallen during the latter part of this time. During frosts and thaws the movements were twice as great. These observations were made by my son Horace, who will hereafter publish an account of the movements of this stone during successive wet and dry seasons, and of the effects of its being undermined by worms. Now when the ground swells, if it be penetrated by cylindrical holes, such as worm-burrows, their walls will tend to yield and be pressed inwards; and the yielding will be greater in the deeper parts (supposing the whole to be equally moistened) from the greater weight of the superincumbent soil which has to be raised, than in the parts near the surface. When the ground dries, the walls will shrink a little and the burrows will be a little enlarged. Their enlargement, however, through the <b>lateral</b> <b>contraction</b> of the ground, will not be favoured, but rather opposed, by the weight of the superincumbent soil.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of uniaxial tension in vivo {{is a common}} test method for investigating mechanical properties of the skin. This paper reports {{an investigation of the}} strain distributions on the skin surface produced by such a test method. The strains were shown to be non-homogeneous with major concentrations being present near the area of load application. At all sites within the test area, axial, lateral and shear strains were present but their magnitude depended both on their position within the test site and the overall extension. The axial and lateral strains were largest and most uniformly distributed within the area bounded by th loading tabs. The shear strains, however, were smallest in the are bounded by the tabs. The distribution of the three strains became similar if they were referred to the principal axes. The area of skin within the strained area became larger as the overall deformation increased because additional skin was recruited from the sites lateral to the strained area. The general form of the load/strain relations and <b>lateral</b> <b>contractions</b> were site- and extension-dependent, but were similar to those found in vitro...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{determining}} the effective incremental response of nonlinearly elastic composite materials given some initial pre-stress, is of interest in numerous application areas. In particular the case when small amplitude elastic waves pass through a pre-stressed inhomogeneous structure is of great importance. Of specific interest is how the initial finite deformation affects the microstructure and thus the subsequent response of the structure. Modelling this effect is in general extremely difficult. In this article we consider the simplest problem of this type where the material is a one dimensional composite bar consisting of two distinct phases, periodically distributed. Neglecting <b>lateral</b> <b>contractions,</b> the initial deformation is thus piecewise homogeneous and we can therefore determine the incremental behaviour semi-analytically, given the constitutive behaviour (strain energy function) of the phases in question. We apply asymptotic homogenization theory in the deformed configuration {{in order to find}} the effective response of the deformed material in the low frequency limit where the wavelength of the propagating waves is much longer than the characteristic lengthscale of the microstructure. We close by considering the arbitrary frequency case and illustrate how the initial deformation affects the location of stop and pass bands of the material. Work is underway to confirm these results experimentally...|$|R

Specifically, equilibration of the film with a vapor phase of adjustable moisture content facilitated the continuous control of film composition, and this {{made it possible to}} maintain single bilayers for periods of days. Several optical features indicate effects of reduced dimensionality on ordering transitions from the Lα phase into the partially ordered, lower temperature Lβ' and Pβ' phases. These include the reversible distortion of layer steps and the formation of dendritic growth patterns {{at the onset of the}} transition. In addition, we find the ordering transitions of thin multilayers to be characterized by an increase in the optical reflectivity. On the basis of a numerical evaluation of a suitable slab model of multibilayers, we attribute this increase primarily to a <b>lateral</b> layer <b>contraction,</b> known to accompany the ordering in bulk dispersions of these materials.

The results were compared with previously published data for V-notch and fatigue-cracked Charpy tests and dynamic fracture-toughness (Kin) tests. Energy, lateral-contraction, and fracture-toughness values were compared. The results of this study showed that the full-shear upper energy shelves in the Charpy V-notch and DT speci-mens are the products of constant average plastic energy densities for each steel and the plastic volume estimates for the fracture of the different specimens. The transition from ductile to brittle fracture behavior is essentially the same in the fatigue-cracked Charpy and D T specimens since, for each steel, the same <b>lateral</b> <b>contraction</b> was measured in each specimen broken at a given temperature. This <b>lateral</b> <b>contraction</b> increased ex-ponentially with temperature until a fidl-thickness shear fracture developed. However, the maximum <b>lateral</b> <b>contraction</b> increased with increased test-specimen thickness, sug-gesting thai the K 0 values corresponding to fidl-shear fracture should also increase with thickness.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundEpithelial {{invagination}} is {{a fundamental}} morphogenetic behavior that transforms a flat cell sheet into a pit or groove. Previous studies of invagination have focused on the role of actomyosin-dependent apical contraction; other mechanisms remain largely unexplored. ResultsWe combined experimental and computational approaches to identify a two-step mechanism for endoderm invagination during ascidian gastrulation. During Step 1, which immediately precedes invagination, endoderm cells constrict their apices because of Rho/Rho-kinase-dependent apical enrichment of 1 P-myosin. Our data suggest that endoderm invagination itself occurs during Step 2, without further apical shrinkage, via a novel mechanism we call collared rounding: Rho/Rho-kinase-independent basolateral enrichment of 1 P-myosin drives apico-basal shortening, whereas Rho/Rho-kinase-dependent enrichment of 1 P and 2 P myosin in circumapical collars is required to prevent apical expansion and for deep invagination. Simulations show that boundary-specific tension values consistent with these distributions of active myosin can explain the cell shape changes observed during invagination both in normal embryos and in embryos treated with pharmacological inhibitors of either Rho-kinase or Myosin II ATPase. Indeed, {{we find that the}} balance of strong circumapical and basolateral tension is the only mechanism based on differential cortical tension that can explain ascidian endoderm invagination. Finally, simulations suggest that mesectoderm cells resist endoderm shape changes during both steps, and we confirm this prediction experimentally. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that early ascidian gastrulation is driven by the coordinated apposition of circumapical and <b>lateral</b> endoderm <b>contraction,</b> working against a resisting mesectoderm.

40|$|Abstract Despite {{increasing}} {{attention to}} management of headwater streams {{as sources of}} water, sediment, and wood to downstream rivers, the extent of headwater channels and perennial flow remain poorly known and inaccurately depicted on topographic maps and in digital hydrographic data. This study reports field mapping of channel head and perennial flow initiation locations in forested landscapes underlain by sandstone and basalt lithologies in Washing-ton State, USA. Contributing source areas were delineated for each feature using a digital elevation model (DEM) {{as well as a}} Global Positioning System device in the field. Systematic source area–slope relationships described in other landscapes were not evident for channel heads in either lithology. In addition, substantial variability in DEM-derived source area sizes relative to field-delineated source areas indicates that in this area, identification of an area–slope relationship, should one even exist, would be difficult. However, channel heads and stream heads, here defined as the start of perennial flow, appear to be co-located within both of the lithologies, which together with <b>lateral</b> expansion and <b>contraction</b> of surface water around channel heads on a seasonal cycle in the basalt lithology, suggest a controlling influence of bedrock springs for that location. While management strategies for determining locations of channel heads and perennial flow initiation in comparable areas could assign standard source area sizes based on limited field data collection within that landscape, field-mapped source areas that support perennial flow are much smaller than recognized by current Wash-ington State regulations...|$|R

40|$|SummaryIntroductionPosterior {{cruciate}} ligament (PCL) injuries are frequently associated with posterolateral corner (PLC) damages. These complex lesions {{are most often}} poorly tolerated clinically. Adherence to sound biomechanical principles treating these complex lesions entails obtaining a functional PCL and reconstructing sufficient posterolateral stability. HypothesisSurgical treatment of postero-posterolateral laxity (PPLL) re-establishes sufficient anatomical integrity to provide stability and satisfactory knee function. Material and methodsIn this retrospective, continuous, single-operator study, 21 patients were operated for chronic PPLL with combined reconstruction of the PCL and PLC and were reviewed with a minimum 1 year follow-up. The clinical and subjective outcomes were evaluated using the IKDC score. Surgical correction of posterior laxity was quantified clinically and radiologically on dynamic posterior drawer images (posterior Telos™ stress test and hamstrings <b>contraction</b> <b>lateral</b> view). ResultsThe mean subjective IKDC score was 62. 8 at the last follow-up versus a preoperative score of 54. 5 (NS). Preoperatively, all were classified in groups C and D. Postoperatively, 13 patients out of 21 were classified in groups A and B according to the overall clinical IKDC score. The radiological gain in laxity was 51 % on the hamstring contraction films and 67 % on the posterior Telos™ images (p< 0. 05). DiscussionThe objective of surgical treatment is to re-establish anatomical integrity to the greatest possible extent. The clinical and radiological laxity results are disappointing {{in terms of the}} objectives but are in agreement with the literature.

DESIGN: Observational case series. PARTICIPANTS: Ten patients (9 males and 1 female; age range, 8 - 75 years; mean age, 41. 1 years) diagnosed with a unilateral orbital blowout fracture (medial wall, floor, or both) and having a normal contralateral orbit. METHODS: Cine mode MRI {{was used to examine}} the role of the mrCPF and the lrCPF in relation to the eyelid and horizontal recti muscles during horizontal eye movements. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To assess the dynamic {{features of the}} mrCPF and the lrCPF. RESULTS: In medial gaze, the medial part of the eyelid moves posteromedially, in synchronicity with medial rectus muscle contraction, mediated by the mrCPF. The lateral part of the eyelid moves anteromedially, in synchronicity with lateral rectus muscle relaxation, mediated by the lrCPF. In lateral gaze, the lateral part of the eyelid moves posterolaterally, in synchronicity with the <b>lateral</b> rectus muscle <b>contraction,</b> mediated by the lrCPF. The medial part of the eyelid moves anterolaterally, in synchronicity with medial rectus muscle relaxation, mediated by the mrCPF. These findings were demonstrated in all 10 patients.

By applying the principle of reduced variables and shifting the isothermal creep curves along the log(time) scale, composite curves were obtained for Poisson's ratio which have the shape of sigmoid curves, thus proving the dependence of this viscoelastic function on time and temperature. It was shown that the corresponding transition regions were shifted towards the origin (t = 0) as the amount of plasticizer was increased, while the shape of the corresponding composite curves did not change and the variation of the logarithmic time factor remained essentially the same but with steeper gradients for increasing amounts of plasticizer. Comparison of the viscoelastic spectra for this function with the corresponding spectra for creep extension, shear and bulk compliances found previously indicated that the spectrum of this function is broader than the others and while it starts to appear earlier than the shear compliance spectrum it disappears after the corresponding bulk compliance spectrum.

40|$|Background—Right bundle branch {{block and}} right {{ventricular}} (RV) dysfunction are common after tetralogy of Fallot repair (rTOF). We hypothesized that right bundle branch block {{is associated with}} specific RV mechanical dyssynchrony and inefficient contraction. Methods and Results—We studied rTOF children and age-matched controls. QRS duration and morphology were assessed. RV mechanical dyssynchrony, indicated by early septal activation (right-sided septal flash), RV <b>lateral</b> wall prestretch/late <b>contraction,</b> postsystolic shortening, and intraventricular delay were analyzed using 2 -dimensional strain echocardiography. Peak oxygen consumption reflected exercise capacity. Pulmonary regurgitation and RV volumes were assessed by MRI. Forty-six rTOF patients and 46 controls were studied. Ninety-three percent of rTOF patients demonstrated a right-sided septal flash with simultaneous RV basal lateral wall prestretch/late activation. The RV basal segment was the most delayed in onset (115 [0 – 194] versus 35 [0 – 96] ms) and termination (462 [369 – 706] versus 412 [325 – 529] ms) of longitudinal shortening, with postsystolic shortening. QRS duration correlated with RV basal time to onset and peak shortening (P< 0. 05). Intra-RV delay was higher in rTOF (P< 0. 05) in association with RV dilatation (r= 0. 33; P= 0. 04). In rTOF, RV mechanics were inefficient, with prestretch and postsystolic shortening comprising 15 ± 11 % and 16 ± 9 % of total shortening, respectively. A composite parameter of electric and mechanical dyssynchrony correlated with RV end-diastolic volume (r= 0. 39; P= 0. 03). Conclusions—Typical electromechanical dyssynchrony associated with mechanical inefficiency, regional dysfunction, and RV dilatation is common in rTOF children, possibly contributing to progressive RV dysfunction.

40|$|Extreme {{rainfall}} events {{associated with}} global warming {{are likely to}} produce {{an increasing number of}} flooding scenarios. A large magnitude of hydrologic events can often result in submerged orifice flow (also called pressure flow) or embankment and bridge overtopping flow, in which the foundation of a bridge is subjected to severe scour at the sediment bed. This phenomenon can cause bridge failure during large floods. However, current laboratory studies have focused on only cases of free-surface flow conditions, and they do not take bridge submergence into account. In this study, abutment scour experiments were carried out in a compound channel to investigate the characteristics of abutment scour in free-surface flow, submerged orifice flow, and overtopping flow cases. Detailed bed contours and three components of velocities and turbulent intensities were measured by acoustic Doppler velocimeters. The results show that the contracted flow around an abutment because of <b>lateral</b> and/or vertical <b>contraction</b> and local turbulent structures at the downstream region of the bridge are the main features of the flow responsible for the maximum scour depth around an abutment. The effects of local turbulent structures on abutment scour are discussed in terms of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) profiles measured {{in a wide range of}} flow contraction ratios. The experimental results showed that maximum abutment scour can be predicted by a suggested single relationship even in different flow types (i. e., free, submerged orifice, and overtopping flow) if the turbulent kinetic energy and discharge under the bridge can be accurately measured.

The fascial lines bordering the transvs. abdominis, obliquus internus and obliquus externus were digitized and the absolute thickness, relative thickness (% of total <b>lateral</b> thickness) and <b>contraction</b> ratio (thickness during hollowing/thickness at rest), as well as the asymmetry (difference between sides expressed as a percent of the smallest value for the two sides) for each of these parameters were determined for each muscle. Both at rest and during hollowing, obliquus internus was the thickest and transvs. abdominis the thinnest muscle. There {{were no significant differences between}} left and right sides for group mean thicknesses of any muscle; however, individual asymmetries were evident, with mean values for the different muscles ranging from 11 % to 26 %; asymmetry was much less for the contraction ratios (mean % side differences, 5 - 14 % depending on muscle). Body mass was the most significant positive predictor of absolute muscle thickness, for all muscles at rest and during hollowing, accounting for 30 - 44 % variance. Body mass index explained 20 - 30 % variance in transvs. abdominis contraction ratio (negative relationship). The influence of these confounders must be considered in comparative studies of healthy controls and back pain patients, unless groups are very carefully matched. Asymmetries observed in patients should be interpreted with caution, as they are also common in healthy subjects...|$|R
40|$|Stretch most {{materials}} {{and you will}} expect to see their cross section shrink. But Alderson and Evans 1 have synthesized a microporous polymer that swells as it is stretched, and Milton 2 has designed a laminated composite that does the same. These advances in the newly developing science of materials with a negative Poisson's ratio (the Poisson's ratio is the ratio of <b>lateral</b> <b>contraction</b> to longitudinal extension in {{in the direction of}} stretching force) promise improved control of properties and open the door to a new class of applications. Virtually all common materials become narrower in cross section when they are stretched. The reason why, in the continuum view, is that most materials resist a change in volume more than they resist a change in shape. Specifically, Poisson's ratio is = (3 K- 2 G) /(6 K + 2 G) with K as the bulk modulus and G a the shear modulus. In a structural view, imagine a material made of atoms interacting by central forces (think of spring elements) between nearest and next nearest neighbors. Stretching of the material will stretch the diagonal springs, causing a <b>lateral</b> <b>contraction.</b> It is possible to have materials which become fatter when stretched, that is, which have a negative Poisson's ratio, since the theory of isotropic elasticity 3 allows Poisson's ratios in the range from- 1 to 1 / 2. Physically the reason is that for the material t...|$|E

The first topic was concerned with the finite element simulation of adhesive joints using cohesive zone models. This kind of models exhibits a high efficiency. Using parameters identified in this project, it was employed for civil engineering applications in BestKleb projects 7 and 8. A material model developed in BestKleb project 3 was transferred into a cohesive zone model considering effects of temperature, humidity, and adhesive layer thickness. Furthermore, new methods to consider the restriction of <b>lateral</b> <b>contraction</b> in cohesive zone models have been developed.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundRegional subpapillary {{myocardial}} hypokinesis may impair lateral {{reduction in}} the interpapillary muscle distance (IPMD) from diastole to systole, and adversely affect mitral valve geometry and tethering. ObjectivesThe goal {{of this study was}} to investigate the impact of impaired lateral shortening in the interpapillary muscle distance on mitral valve geometry and function in ischemic heart disease. MethodsTo quantify ventricular size/shape, regional myocardial <b>contraction,</b> <b>lateral</b> shortening of the IPMD, mitral valve geometry, and severity of mitral regurgitation, 67 patients with ischemic heart disease underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and a correlation analysis of measured parameters was performed. The impact of reduced IPMD shortening on mitral valve (dys) function was confirmed in swine and in a physiological computational mitral valve model. ResultsLateral shortening of the IPMD from diastole to systole was severely reduced in patients with moderate/severe ischemic mitral regurgitation (9. 6 ± 2. 8 mm), but preserved in mild IMR (11. 5 ± 3. 4 mm). Left ventricular size and ejection fraction did not differ between the groups. In swine with subpapillary infarction and impaired IPMD, mitral regurgitation was evident within 1 week, compared to those pigs with a nonpapillary infarction and preserved IPMD. In the controlled computational valve model, IPMD had the maximal impact on regurgitation, and was exacerbated with additional annular dilation. ConclusionsBy using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in humans, we demonstrated that it is the impairment of lateral shortening between the papillary muscles, and not passive ventricular size, that governs the severity of mitral regurgitation. Loss of lateral shortening of IPMD tethers the leaflet edges and impairs their systolic closure, resulting in mitral regurgitation, even in small ventricles. Understanding the lateral dynamics of ventricular-valve interactions could aid the development of new repair techniques for ischemic mitral regurgitation...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundAs right {{ventricular}} lead {{is positioned}} endocardialy and left ventricular lead epicardialy, {{we hypothesized that}} baseline epi-endo gradient could predict CRT response. Method and resultsWe studied 46 patients referred for CRT. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed for all patients before and one year after implantation. Offline analysis with speckle tracking imaging (STI) analysis of LV endocardial and epicardial wall was performed. Specifically, epi-endo gradient delay (GD) and gradient contraction (GC) measurements were performed on the septal and lateral LV wall before and one year after implantation. CRT response {{was defined as a}} reduction> 15 % of LV end systolic volume one year after CRT. ResultsMean age was 62 ± 11 year-old and mean EF was 26 ± 7 %. Twenty-two patients were classified as responders. Baseline characteristics of patients with or without CRT response were similar, except for QRS duration. Before implantation, septal (10 ± 31 ms vs. 20 ± 133 ms, p= 0. 67) and lateral GD (1 ± 25 ms vs. 4 ± 26 ms, p= 0. 76) were low and similar in both groups. However lateral GC was higher in CRT responders (– 4. 05 ± 2. 29 % vs. – 2. 38 ± 2. 82 %, p= 0. 009). After multivariate analysis, lateral GC was the best predictor of CRT response (p= 0. 013). One year after implantation, septal GD and GC were comparable in CRT responders or not. However lateral GC significantly decreased in CRT responders (– 4. 05 ± 2. 29 % at baseline vs. – 1. 86 ± 2. 2 %, p< 0. 01) whereas no changes were observed for non-responders. Finally lateral GD was significantly increased at one year in CRT non responders 4 ± 26 ms at baseline vs. 18 ± 43 ms, p< 0. 01). Conclusion: At baseline no significant LV epicardial-endocardial delay gradient was observed in patients with CRT response or not. However <b>lateral</b> epi-endo gradient <b>contraction</b> is highly independently associated with CRT response. Finally this gradient was homo-genezing one year after CRT for responders...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether, in patients with evidence of both electrical and mechanical left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony, extensive LV dilation would affect response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). BackgroundCardiac resynchronization therapy is effective in heart failure patients with LV dysfunction and wide QRS complex. However, many patients still fail to respond. We hypothesized that presence of extensive LV dilation might prevent response to CRT, despite LV mechanical dyssynchrony. MethodsWe studied 78 heart failure patients (68 ± 9 years of age, 77 % men) with both electrical (QRS width > 120 ms) and mechanical intraventricular dyssynchrony (by tissue Doppler imaging and/or left <b>lateral</b> wall post-systolic <b>contraction).</b> Echocardiographic evaluation was performed at baseline and 6 to 8 months after CRT. As an indication of LV remodeling, end-diastolic volume index and end-systolic volume index (ESVI) and sphericity index were measured. Long-term (40 ± 23 months) clinical follow-up (events: cardiac death and hospital admission for heart failure) was also obtained. ResultsAt follow-up after CRT, in the overall population, ejection fraction increased from 26 ± 6 % to 35 ± 11 % (p < 0. 0001), whereas end-diastolic volume index (from 144 ± 43 ml/m 2 to 119 ± 55 ml/m 2), ESVI (from 108 ± 37 ml/m 2 to 82 ± 49 ml/m 2, p < 0. 0001 for both), and sphericity index (from 0. 60 ± 0. 22 to 0. 53 ± 0. 15, p = 0. 0036) all significantly decreased. By multiple linear regression analysis, after controlling for confounding factors, change in LV ejection fraction at follow-up resulted independently and negatively associated with baseline ESVI (p = 0. 001), with much lower improvement after implant in the highest tertile of baseline ESVI. During follow-up, 31 patients (39. 7 %) had a cardiac event. By Cox regression model, baseline ESVI was the most powerful predictor of events, with event-rate/year increasing with increasing tertiles of ESVI (6. 3 %, 10. 1 %, and 23. 8 %, respectively, p < 0. 05). ConclusionsIn this nonrandomized, open-label clinical study, despite intraventricular electrical and mechanical dyssynchrony, extensive LV remodeling at baseline negatively impacted CRT results in terms of LV function improvement and incidence of cardiac events at follow-up...|$|R
