A coarse alignment of the point clouds is generally needed before applying local methods such as the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. We propose a feature-based approach to point cloud registration and evaluate the proposed method and its individual components on challenging real-world datasets. For a moderate overlap between the laser scans, the method provides a superior registration accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods including Generalized ICP, 3 D Normal-Distribution Transform, Fast Point-Feature Histograms, and 4 -Points Congruent Sets.

For example, the orientation in space of a line, line segment, or vector can be specified with only two values, for example two direction cosines. Another example is {{the position of a}} point on the earth, often described using the orientation of a line joining it with the earth's center, measured using the two angles of longitude and latitude.

Finally, we provide a state-independent entanglement witness solely in terms of random correlations and emphasise how data gathered for a single random measurement setting per party reliably detects entanglement. This is only possible due to utilised randomness and should find practical applications in experimental confirmation of multi-photon entanglement or space experiments...|$|R
