25|$|Very low {{voltages}} are inefficient {{since the}} lead wires would conduct too much heat away from the filament, so the practical lower limit for incandescent lamps is 1.5 volts. Very long filaments for high voltages are fragile, and <b>lamp</b> <b>bases</b> become more difficult to insulate, so lamps for illumination are not made with rated voltages over 300 volts. Some infrared heating elements are made for higher voltages, but these use tubular bulbs with widely separated terminals.|$|E

30|$|It {{has to be}} kept in {{mind that}} the slit <b>lamp</b> <b>based</b> {{evaluation}} allows analysis of the shape of the retinal surface contour only even though we see parallels between our slit <b>lamp</b> <b>based</b> procedure of measurement and the way an RTA (scanning retinal thickness analyzer) works (Zou et al. 2006). The RTA, however, images a green He-Ne laser slit beam (540  nm) projected obliquely onto the retina and retinal thickness is calculated from the separation between the reflections from the vitreoretinal and the chorioretinal interface.|$|R
5000|$|XeCl and [...] {{are most}} {{important}} in laser applications amongst the xenon chlorides. Although discharge <b>lamps</b> <b>based</b> on low-pressure mixtures of xenon and a chlorine donor emit incoherent light, they are reliable and easy to operate.|$|R
25|$|Very small lamps {{may have}} the {{filament}} support wires extended through {{the base of the}} lamp, and can be directly soldered to a printed circuit board for connections. Some reflector-type lamps include screw terminals for connection of wires. Most lamps have metal bases that fit in a socket to support the lamp and conduct current to the filament wires. In the late 19th century, manufacturers introduced a multitude of incompatible <b>lamp</b> <b>bases.</b> General Electric introduced standard base sizes for tungsten incandescent lamps under the Mazda trademark in 1909. This standard was soon adopted across the US, and the Mazda name was used by many manufacturers under license through 1945. Today most incandescent lamps for general lighting service use an Edison screw in candelabra, intermediate, or standard or mogul sizes, or double contact bayonet base. Technical standards for <b>lamp</b> <b>bases</b> include ANSI standard C81.67 and IEC standard 60061-1 for common commercial lamp sizes, to ensure interchangeablitity between different manufacturer's products. Bayonet base lamps are frequently used in automotive lamps to resist loosening due to vibration. A bipin base is often used for halogen or reflector lamps.|$|E
25|$|Sugar beet is an {{important}} source of sugar. Yam roots are a source of estrogen compounds used in birth control pills. The fish poison and insecticide rotenone is obtained from roots of Lonchocarpus spp. Important medicines from roots are ginseng, aconite, ipecac, gentian and reserpine. Several legumes that have nitrogen-fixing root nodules are used as green manure crops, which provide nitrogen fertilizer for other crops when plowed under. Specialized bald cypress roots, termed knees, are sold as souvenirs, <b>lamp</b> <b>bases</b> and carved into folk art. Native Americans used the flexible roots of white spruce for basketry.|$|E

It is distinguished by decoration in cobalt blue, based on traditional designs. In {{the community of}} Santa María Canchesda of this municipality, eight artisans, including two Mazahua, work to make high fire ceramics such as tea sets, shot glasses for tequila, bowls, flowerpots, napkin holders, fruit bowls, decorative figures, <b>lamp</b> <b>bases</b> and more.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the lead}} {{set by the}} lamp {{manufacturers}} in standardising <b>lamp</b> <b>bases,</b> a conference of the plug and receptacle manufacturers, including Hubbell, was arranged {{with a view to}} agreeing a standard configuration. It was a time of great expansion in the use of electrical appliances such as fans, heaters, and cookers, as well as portable devices such as hair curlers and irons, and the public wanted interchangeability. Hubbell's parallel pin configuration was preferred, but Hubbell [...] "rebelled against standardization", and refused to agree, asserting that it had common law rights in the dimensions of its line. The other conference members pressed on regardless, and agreed to standardize on Hubbell's parallel flat pin configuration and dimensions. Hubbell's court action only served to confirm the legality of their activities, to the great benefit of the US public.|$|E
2500|$|In 1955, Gladding, McBean & Co. {{introduced}} a new art ware line. [...] The company had ceased manufacturing all their earthenware art ware lines under the trademarks of Franciscan and Catalina in 1942. [...] However, the Company continued until 1955 to manufacture fine china blanks for the Max Shoenfeld Company and earthenware <b>lamp</b> <b>bases</b> for outside companies to assemble and sell under their trade names. [...] This new Franciscan line was named Contours by George T. James. [...] The Contours art ware line was sold in one color or duotone glazes, with or without decoration. [...] The Contours art ware line was the only art ware or dinnerware line the company allowed the designer to use their name on the promotion and marketing. Three Franciscan Contours bud vases were chosen for the Pasadena Art Museum’s second California Design Exhibition in 1956. [...] Franciscan Contours did not appeal to the buying public, and was discontinued shortly after its introduction.|$|E
2500|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{traditional}} low temperature and higher temperature firing techniques {{are used in the}} Guadalajara area, to produce ware from cheap objects to artistic productions. The two main pottery producing municipalities are Tonalá and Tlaquepaque. These two municipalities produce several different types of pottery and ceramics, principally [...] "bruñido", [...] "bandera", [...] "canelo", [...] "petate", [...] "betus" [...] and high-fire/stoneware. The best known of these styles is bruñido, which translates to burnished. It probably descends from polychrome produced in this area en the 19th century. The name {{comes from the fact that}} these pieces are not glazed, but rather they are given a slip and then polished with a stone or pyrite. Many of these pieces are slender necked jugs or <b>lamp</b> <b>bases,</b> often decorated with animals, such as rabbits, with distorted characteristics, giving them a surreal look. The pieces are usually painted with delicate tones of rose, gray-blue and white on a background of a light coffee color, light gray and sometimes green or blue. Each piece is individually created. The attraction of this pottery is its appearance, as it is too porous to hold any liquid or food. One exception to this are thick large tubs mainly to store water or for bathing. Water stored in this kind of vessel takes on a flavor from the pottery, which is desired by some people. Another exception is a water container with a fat body and long neck, with a ceramic cup placed upside down over the neck. These are called botellones, and are similar to carafes. One town that specializes in these is El Rosario, near Tonalá.|$|E
50|$|The lamp {{was invented}} by the French watchmaker Bernard Guillaume Carcel (1750-1818) to {{overcome}} the disadvantages of the Argand-type lamps then in use. The vegetable - mostly colza - oils then available were thick and would not travel far up a wick. The Argand lamps used a gravity feed which meant that the oil reservoir was located above the burner, casting a shadow and making the lamp top heavy. Carcel designed a lamp with the oil reservoir under the burner, {{in the body of}} the lamp. To keep the oil moving up to the burner, Carcel housed a clockwork mechanism in the <b>lamp</b> <b>base</b> that drove a small pump submerged in the oil tank. The winding key was located at the bottom of the <b>lamp</b> <b>base.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1930, Hungarian Imre Bródy filled lamps with krypton gas {{rather than}} argon, and {{designed}} {{a process to}} obtain krypton from air. Production of krypton filled <b>lamps</b> <b>based</b> on his invention started at Ajka in 1937, in a factory co-designed by Polányi and Hungarian-born physicist Egon Orowan.|$|R

25|$|The compact {{fluorescent}} lamp (CFL) replaces regular incandescent bulbs.
