500|$|The {{development}} of the ZX81 got under way even before the ZX80 had been launched. Sinclair's chief engineer, Jim Westwood, was given the task of improving the ZX80's hardware {{to reduce the number}} of components and thus bring down the cost. He also sought to fix some of the more annoying problems with the ZX80. Westwood and his colleagues found that the component count could be reduced greatly by combining eighteen of the ZX80's chips into a single uncommitted logic array (ULA), a type of general-purpose chip full of logic gates that were connected up as the customer required during chip manufacture. This short-lived technology of the day was cheaper and quicker than the design of a customised <b>logic</b> <b>chip,</b> which typically required very high volumes to recoup its development cost. Ferranti produced the new chip for Sinclair, who hailed Westwood's design as a triumph of innovation: [...] "The ZX81 had four chips when our nearest competitor in this respect, the TRS-80, had 44." [...] Only 70% of the logic gates on the ULA were supposed to be used, but Sinclair decided to obtain maximum benefit by using them all. This resulted in the machine becoming uncomfortably warm during usage. Computing folklore held that the ZX81 had to be refrigerated by balancing a carton of cold milk on top of the case.|$|E

5000|$|The 8 kB hi-res {{frame buffer}} (like all 8-bit Apple II video modes), due to another <b>logic</b> <b>chip</b> conserving idiosyncrasy, was interleaved, and in blocks of 128 bytes, with 8 byte non-displayed [...] "holes" [...] in between. Under Apple DOS all binary files had a header of 4 bytes (2 {{integers}} representing the address {{and length of}} the save). However, since one of the holes was {{at the very end}} of the buffer, it could safely be omitted from the save, keeping the entire package inside of 8 kB (with 4 bytes to spare), which avoided the file taking another 256 byte block just for those 4 bytes of metadata.

50|$|Federico Faggin (born December 1, 1941), is an Italian physicist, {{inventor}} and entrepreneur, {{widely known}} for designing {{the first commercial}} microprocessor. He led the 4004 (MCS-4) project and the design group during {{the first five years}} of Intel's microprocessor effort. Most importantly, Faggin created in 1968, while working at Fairchild Semiconductor, the self-aligned MOS silicon gate technology (SGT) that made possible dynamic memories, non-volatile memories, CCD image sensors, and the microprocessor. In addition, he further developed at Intel his original SGT into a new methodology for random <b>logic</b> <b>chip</b> design that was essential to the creation of the world’s first single chip microprocessor and all other early Intel microprocessors. He was co-founder, with Ralph Ungermann, and CEO of Zilog, the first company solely dedicated to microprocessors. He was also co-founder and CEO of Cygnet Technologies and of Synaptics.|$|E
5000|$|Breakout, a {{discrete}} logic (non-microprocessor) game, {{was designed by}} Nolan Bushnell, Steve Wozniak, and Steve Bristow, all three of whom were involved with Atari and its Kee Games subsidiary. Atari produced innovative video games using the Pong hardware {{as a means of}} competition against companies making [...] "Pong clones". Bushnell wanted to turn Pong into a single player game, where the player would use a paddle to maintain a ball that depletes a wall of bricks. Bushnell was certain the game would be popular, and he and Bristow partnered to produce a concept. Al Alcorn was assigned as the Breakout project manager, and began development with Cyan Engineering in 1975. Bushnell assigned Steve Jobs to design a prototype. Jobs was offered $750, with an award for every TTL (transistor-transistor <b>logic)</b> <b>chip</b> fewer than 50. Jobs promised to complete a prototype within four days.|$|E
5000|$|At the time, Microsoft {{was working}} with several vendors {{in order to develop}} a {{reference}} implementation known as Escalante. Samsung and 3DO were working together to design a single-chip DSP-like [...] "Media Signal Processor" [...] (MSP), combining Talisman functionality with additional media functionality. Cirrus Logic would provide a VLSI chip that would retrieve data placed in memory by the MSP, apply effects, and send it off for display. Known as the [...] "Polygon Object Processor" [...] (POP), this chip was periodically polled by another Cirrus <b>Logic</b> <b>chip,</b> the [...] "Image Layer Compositor" [...] (ILC), which was tied to the video circuitry. Additionally, Escalante intended to feature 4 MB of RDRAM on two 600 MHz 8-bit channels, offering 1.2 GB/s throughput. Later Philips entered the fray with a planned new version of their TriMedia processor, which implemented most of Talisman in a single CPU, and Trident Microsystems, with similar plans.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Apple IIc motherboard (manufactured between April and November 1984) derived {{the timing}} for its two serial ports through a 74LS161 TTL <b>logic</b> <b>chip.</b> It was later {{found that this}} method’s timing was 3% slower than the minimum requirement specified and caused some third-party (i.e. non-Apple) modems and printers, which operated at 1200 bits per second (baud) or faster, to function improperly. Slower serial devices operating at 300 baud or less were unaffected, {{as well as some}} faster devices which could tolerate the deviation. The solution to ensure all devices were compatible was to replace the TTL chip with an oscillator during manufacture. Apple would swap affected motherboards for users who could prove they had an incompatible serial device (e.g. a third-party 1200-baud modem which presented problems; not all did). It is important to note the problem did not affect all owners; it was more or less a hit-or-miss issue depending on the specific device connected.|$|E

50|$|In 1984, Banatao and his {{business}} partner Francis Siu, founded a high-technology company, Mostron, starting with a capital of half a million US dollars. Mostron was launched as a manufacturer of motherboards. They also hired Ron Yara of Intel as a company executive. After he developed a five-chip set, he co-founded Chips and Technologies in 1985. The company developed system <b>logic</b> <b>chip</b> set for IBM's PC-XT and the PC-AT. The company earned $12 million in its first four months. After 22 months, the company went public. In 1989, Banatao launched his third start-up company, S3 Graphics, with Yara in Santa Clara, California. S3 focused on enhancing the graphic capabilities in personal computers by using a graphic accelerator chip. The key to this was, Banatao's invention of a local bus. The company had {{an initial public offering}} of $30 million. In 1996, the company became the leader of the graphic-chips market, beating a strong competitor, Cirrus Logic, Inc.. In the same year, Chips & Technologies was sold to Intel for about $300 million. In 2000, he decided to start-up his own venture capital firm named Tallwood Venture Capital with a capital of US$300 million, all of which came from his own pocket. He later sold another company for more than $1 billion, where it had less than 20 employees. Dado was also part of SiRF, where it started the consumerization of GPS after it had been declassified by the US Government.|$|E

50|$|Federico Faggin joined Intel from Fairchild In 1970 as {{the project}} leader and {{designer}} of the MCS-4 family which included the 4004, the world's first single-chip microprocessor. The 4004 (1971) {{was made possible by}} the advanced capabilities of the silicon gate technology (SGT) being enhanced through the novel random <b>logic</b> <b>chip</b> design methodology that Faggin created at Intel. It was this new methodology, together with his several design innovations, that allowed him to fit the microprocessor in one small chip. A single-chip microprocessor — an idea that was expected to occur many years in the future — became possible in 1971 by using SGT with two additional innovations: (1)“buried contacts” that doubled the circuit density, and (2) the use of bootstrap loads with 2-phase clocks—previously considered impossible with SGT— that improved the speed 5 times, while reducing the number of transistors. The design methodology created by Faggin was utilized for the implementation of all Intel’s early microprocessors and later also for Zilog's Z80.The Intel 4004 — a 4-bit CPU (central processing unit) on a single chip — {{was a member of a}} family of 4 custom chips designed for Busicom, a Japanese calculator manufacturer. The other members of the family (constituting the MCS-4 family) were: the 4001, a 2k-bit metal-mask programmable ROM with programmable input-output lines; the 4002, a 320-bit dynamic RAM with a 4-bit output port; and the 4003, a 10-bit serial input and serial/parallel output, static shift register to be used as I/O expander. Faggin promoted the idea of broadly marketing the MCS-4 to customers other than Busicom by showing to Intel management how customers could design a control systems using the 4004. He designed and built a 4004 tester using the 4004 as the controller of the tester, thus convincing Bob Noyce to renegotiate the exclusivity clause with Busicom that didn’t allow Intel to sell 4004’s to other customers.|$|E
40|$|Control Loop Feedback Mechanism for Generic Array <b>Logic</b> <b>Chip</b> Multiprocessor is presented. The {{approach}} {{is based on}} control-loop feedback mechanism to maximize the efficiency on exploiting available resources such as CPU time, operating frequency, etc. Each Processing Element (PE) in the architecture {{is equipped with a}} frequency scaling module responsible for tuning the frequency of processors at run-time according to the application requirements.
