40|$|Trade in {{primates}} {{is seen as}} {{a significant}} impediment to their conservation. Primates are traded both domestically and internationally, in order to supply, amongst others, biomedical industries and pharmaceutical markets, the entertainment business, or pet markets. Primate meat is consumed globally, whereas body parts are used as ingredients in traditional medicine or sold as curios. All international trade in primates is regulated through the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), to which all but 2 primate range countries are signatory. The last 15 years has seen a linear increase in the export of <b>live</b> <b>primates</b> (each year 3500 more individuals are exported), with China being, numerically, the largest exporter. While the trade in <b>live</b> <b>primates</b> worldwide involves tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of individuals a year, the trade in dead primates involves millions of animals a year. We introduce here a series of studies dealing with various aspects of the primate trade. We hope that these studies will urge others to quantify the extent of trade in primates alive and dead in both domestic and international contexts, allowing us to find ways to mitigate the consequences of this trade to the conservation of primates...|$|E

40|$|Progress in gerontological {{research}} has been promoted {{through the use of}} numerous animal models, which have helped identify possible mechanisms of aging and age-related chronic diseases and evaluate possible interventions with potential relevance to human aging and disease. Further development of nonhuman primate models, particularly rhesus monkeys, could accelerate this progress, because their closer genetic relationship to humans produces a highly similar aging phenotype. Because the relatively long <b>lives</b> of <b>primates</b> increase the administrative and economic demands on research involving them, new emphasis has emerged on increasing the efficient use of these valuable resources through cooperative, interdisciplinary research.

50|$|In mammals, {{interaction}} between the sexes is usually limited to the female estrous or copulation. However, in non-human primates, these male-female bonds persist past the estrous.

40|$|Background: Use of <b>live</b> {{non-human}} <b>primates</b> (NHPs) in {{biomedical research}} is a controversial issue {{in many parts}} of the world. Recent use of NHPs in research in Asian countries was surveyed. Aim: To elucidate the use of NHPs in research in Asian countries. Settings and design: The peer-reviewed literature was sampled according to the species used, area of research, research class and geographic location. Articles derived from database searches were scrutinised. Methods and Material: Studies were identified from the PrimateLit database. Results and Conclusion: Results suggested that NHP research was conducted in 16 countries, of which Japan accounted for two-thirds. About 55 &#x 0025; of studies involved use of live animals, whereas the remaining 45 &#x 0025; used some lower level of biological material.

40|$|Abstract. Wild {{populations of}} nonhuman <b>primates</b> <b>live</b> in regions of sylvatic {{arbovirus}} transmission. To assess {{the status of}} arbovirus transmission in Bornean forests and the susceptibility of wild orangutans to arboviral infection, blood samples of wild orangutans, semi-captive orangutans, and humans were examined. Samples were tested by plaque reduction neutralization test for antibodies to viruses representing three families (Flaviviridae, Alphaviridae, and Bunyaviridae), including dengue- 2, Japanese encephalitis, Zika, Langat, Tembusu, Sindbis, Chikungunya, and Batai viruses. Both wild and semi-captive orangutan {{groups as well as}} local human populations showed serologic evidence of arbovirus infection. The presence of neutralizing antibodies among wild orangutans strongly suggests the existence of sylvatic cycles for dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and sindbis viruses in North Borneo. The present study demonstrates that orangutans are susceptible to arboviral infections in the wild, although the impact of arboviral infections on this endangered ape remain unknown...|$|R
40|$|Small-brained rodents {{have been}} the {{principle}} focus for pheromonal research and have provided comprehensive insights into the chemosensory mechanisms that underpin pheromonal communication and the hugely important roles that pheromones play in behavioural regulation. However, pheromonal communication does not start or end with the mouse and the rat, and work in amphibians reveals much about the likely evolutionary origins of the chemosensory systems that mediate pheromonal effects. The dual olfactory organs (the main olfactory epithelium and the vomeronasal organ), their receptors and their separate projection pathways appear to have ancient evolutionary origins, appearing in the aquatic ancestors of all tetrapods during the Devonian period and so pre-dating the transition to land. While the vomeronasal organ has long been considered an exclusively pheromonal organ, accumulating evidence indicates {{that it is not}} the sole channel for the transduction of pheromonal information and that both olfactory systems have been co-opted for the detection of different pheromone signals over the course of evolution. This has also led to great diversity in the vomeronasal and olfactory receptor families, with enormous levels of gene diversity and inactivation of genes in different species. Finally, the evolution of trichromacy as well as huge increases in social complexity have minimised the role of pheromones in the <b>lives</b> of <b>primates,</b> leading to the total inactivation of the vomeronasal system in catarrhine primates while the brain increased in size and behaviour became emancipated from hormonal regulation. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|Most <b>primates</b> <b>live</b> {{in social}} groups which {{survival}} and stability depend on individuals' abilities to create strong social {{relationships with other}} group members. The existence of those groups requires to identify individuals and to assign {{to each of them}} a social status. Individual recognition can be achieved through vocalizations but also through faces. In humans, an efficient system for the processing of own species faces exists. This specialization is achieved through experience with faces of conspecifics during development and leads to the loss of ability to process faces from other primate species. We hypothesize that a similar mechanism exists in social primates. We investigated face processing in one Old World species (genus Macaca) and in one New World species (genus Cebus). Our results show the same advantage for own species face recognition for all tested subjects. This work suggests in all species tested the existence of a common trait inherited from the primate ancestor: an efficient system to identify individual faces of own species only...|$|R
40|$|Many social animals live in {{relatively}} stable groups, and often these groups occupy partially overlapping home ranges. This non-exclusivity raises fundamental {{questions about how}} groups temporally partition the landscape, defined as shared yet non-synchronous use of the same resources. The most proffered theoretical explanation is that social dominance hierarchies mediate temporal landscape partitioning by influencing where and when individuals travel within regions of home range overlap. However, few studies to date have assessed how competition between groups affects their spatiotemporal interactions. My main objective was to address this topic by quantifying the factors influencing temporal landscape partitioning among conspecific groups in a well-characterized population of wild baboons (Papio cynocephalus). These empirical results were used to develop a theoretical framework against which fitness benefits of social dominance {{as they relate to}} spatiotemporal organization can be tested in other species, including non-primates.

40|$|Most <b>primates</b> <b>live</b> {{in social}} groups in which affiliative bonds exist between individuals. Because these bonds {{need to be}} {{maintained}} through social interactions (grooming in most primates), sociality will be limited by time constraints. It has previously been shown that the time primates invest in grooming increases with group size. However, when groups become too large, individuals will not have enough time available to service all possible social relationships and group cohesion is expected to decrease. In this study, we use data from previously published studies to determine how large groups compromise on their grooming time and how ecological, phylogenetic and lifehistory variables affect time invested in grooming (across species as well as within taxa). We use path analysis to analyse direct and indirect (via group size) effects on grooming. We show {{that not only is}} grooming time determined by group size, but it is also affected by dispersal patterns and sex ratio. Furthermore, we found that grooming time is asymptotic when group size exceeds 40 individuals, indicating that time constraints resulting from ecological pressure force individuals t...|$|R
40|$|Individuals value {{information}} that improves decision making. When social interactions complicate the decision process, acquiring information about others should be particularly valuable [1]. In primate societies, kinship, dominance, and reproductive status regulate social interactions [2, 3] and should therefore systematically influence {{the value of}} social information, but this has never been demonstrated. Here, we show that monkeys differentially value the opportunity to acquire visual information about particular classes of social images. Male rhesus macaques sacrificed fluid {{for the opportunity to}} view female perinea and the faces of highstatus monkeys but required fluid overpayment to view the faces of low-status monkeys. Social value was highly consistent across subjects, independent of particular images displayed, and only partially predictive of how long subjects chose to view each image. These data demonstrate that visual orienting decisions reflect the specific social content of visual information and provide the first experimental evidence that monkeys spontaneously discriminate images of others based on social status.

Dian’s tarsier Tarsius dianae, {{one of the smallest}} <b>primates,</b> <b>lives</b> in forests of central Sulawesi, Indonesia that are experiencing a dramatic increase in degradation by humans. To evaluate the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on tarsiers we used a comprehensive approach to estimate habitat suitability for these nocturnal insecthunters. On four study plots along a gradient of human land-use we determined population densities, home range sizes, nightly path lengths and group sizes of T. dianae. In total we captured 71 individuals and radio-tracked 30 of these. In more undisturbed sites, population densities were high and travel distances small. We found the smallest home ranges in slightly disturbed forest. In a heavily disturbed plantation densities were low, and ranges and nightly path lengths were large. These results show that undisturbed and slightly degraded forests are the most suitable tarsier habitats, and that focusing on different population parameters could lead to differing conclusions about the suitability of particular habitats...|$|R
