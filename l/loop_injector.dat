30|$|Materials and methods: Commercial GE Tracerlab FXC-Pro {{synthesizer}} {{was modified}} to enable 11 C-methylation with both [11 C]methyl iodide and [11 C]methyl triflate {{as well as}} direct 11 C-carboxylation with [11 C]CO 2. Additional magnetic valves were installed to bypass the [11 C]methyl iodide recycling system for direct use of [11 C]CO 2 and to bypass the [11 C]methyl triflate oven when using [11 C]methyl iodide as such. The valves are operated by Tracerlab software. The HPLC operations were modified by installing pneumatic column selector and a syringe operated <b>loop</b> <b>injector.</b> A sterile filtration unit (SFU) was coupled with synthesizer to allow online filter integrity test. For monitoring purposes more GM tubes were also installed. [11 C]PK 11195 was labeled with [11 C]methyl iodide while [11 C]methionine and [11 C]metomidate were labeled with [11 C]methyl triflate. [11 C]Acetate was synthesized using direct carboxylation with [11 C]CO 2. Semi-preparative HPLC {{was used for the}} purification of [11 C]PK 11195 and [11 C]methionine. Solid phase extraction cartridges were used for the purification of [11 C]metomidate and [11 C]acetate.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- A simple flow {{injection}} technique for measuring DOC on few nanoliter of marine pore waters {{has been developed}} to complement existing high temperature oxidation techniques. Samples of 60 - 500 nanoliter of interstitial water are introduced with a <b>loop</b> <b>injector</b> directly into a capillary tube connected to a scanning UV-VIS detector. A nano flow cell detection device (35 nL) allowed for the acquisition of a complete UV-VIS spectrum or an absorbance measurement at a specific wavelength. Results obtained in this study with the UV method correlate significantly with those obtained using the high-temperature catalytic oxidation (HTCO) method. The UV method described addresses the HTCO limits and offers the possibility of near real-time DOC measurements onboard ship with a throughput of 30 samples per hour. The method has been used successfully to study the distribution of DOC in Saguenay fjord (Quebec, Canada) sediments following a major flood event in July 1996. Results comparable to HTCO method were obtained more rapidly and {{with only a few}} nanoliter sample of marine pore waters...|$|E

The {{volume of the}} <b>injector</b> <b>loop</b> was 20  μl. Chromatographic separation was achieved by using C 18, Thermo Hypersil-Keystone column, and mobile phase of acetonitrile and distilled water containing 10 % glacial acetic acid (75 : 25).

30|$|Results: The average {{synthesis}} {{times were}} 30 minutes for [11 C]methionine, 38 minutes for [11 C]PK 11195, 20 minutes for [11 C]metomidate and [11 C]acetate including purification, formulation and online sterile filter integrity test. [11 C]Radiopharmaceuticals were obtained in good radiochemical yields, sufficiently for several simultaneous clinical doses. The radiochemical purity exceeded 95 % in all syntheses. The use of column selector enables easy change of HPLC columns between syntheses. The filling of the <b>injector</b> <b>loop</b> with pneumatic syringe decreases losses of the injection solutions {{compared to the}} inbuilt fluid detector. Due to {{the limited number of}} electrical connections in Tracerlab FXC-Pro the column selector, loop syringe and SFU are remote controlled from external touch screen. Readings from additional GM tubes are also shown on the touch screen.|$|R
40|$|In the {{interest}} of developing in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) probes for neuroimaging of calcium channels, we have prepared a carbon- 11 isotopologue of a dihydropyridine Ca 2 +-channel antagonist, isradipine. Desmethyl isradipine (4 -(benzo[c][1, 2, 5]oxadiazol- 4 -yl) - 5 -(isopropoxycarbonyl) - 2, 6 -dimethyl- 1, 4 -dihydropyridine - 3 -carboxylic acid) was reacted with [11 C]CH 3 I {{in the presence of}} tetrabutylammonium hydroxide in DMF in an HPLC <b>injector</b> <b>loop</b> to produce the radiotracer in a good yield (6 ± 3 % uncorrected radiochemical yield) and high specific activity (143 ± 90 GBq·µmol− 1 at end-of-synthesis). PET imaging of normal rats revealed rapid brain uptake at baseline (0. 37 ± 0. 08 % ID/cc (percent of injected dose per cubic centimeter) at peak, 15 – 60 s), which was followed by fast washout. After pretreatment with isradipine (2 mg·kg− 1, i. p.), whole brain radioactivity uptake was diminished by 25 %– 40 %. This preliminary study confirms that [11 C]isradipine can be synthesized routinely for research studies and is brain penetrating. Further work on Ca 2 +-channel radiotracer development is planned...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} was aimed to explore {{phytochemical}} constituents present in Amphiroa anceps (Lamarck) Decaisne. The extracts of A. anceps were scanned in the wavelength ranging from 200 to 1100 nm by using Shimadzu Spectrophotometer. HPLC method was performed on a Shimadzu LC- 10 AT VP HPLC system, which was equipped with a model LC- 10 AT pump, UV–VIS detector SPD- 10 AT, Rheodyne injector fitted with a 20 μl <b>loop</b> and auto <b>injector</b> SIL- 10 AT. Out of 156 (2 × 6 × 13 = 156) tests for {{the presence or absence}} of the above compounds, 42 tests gave positive results and the remaining 114 showed negative results. The 42 positive results showed the presence of alkaloids, steroids, phenolic groups, saponins, tannin, flavonoids, terpenoids, glycosides, proteins and sugars. The results of the ash analysis discovered the existence of sulphur, calcium, magnesium, iron, phosphorous and chlorine in all the extracts of A. anceps. The UV–VIS profile of A. anceps benzene extracts showed peaks at 670, 612, 536, 504, and 412 nm with the absorption 2. 004, 0. 333, 0. 417, 0. 608 and 3. 311. The UV–VIS profile of A. anceps chloroform extracts showed the peaks at 666, 608, 538, 502 and 416 nm with the absorption 1. 029, 0. 39, 0. 458, 0. 552 and 2. 648. The qualitative UV–VIS spectrum profile of A. anceps methanolic extracts showed peaks at 656 and 330 nm with the absorption 0. 295 and 3. 656.

40|$|Phosphatidylinositol {{phosphates}} (PIPs) are phospholipids (PLs) {{that play}} fundamental roles as signaling molecules in numerous cellular processes. However, PIPs have shown to be {{perhaps some of the}} most challenging compounds to analyze in bioanalytical samples, as PIPs are strongly adsorbed to surfaces containing glass and metal, and can easily stick to column walls, injectors and tubings, and build up a nonionized layer on the MS ion source. In this study, the suitability of reversed phase (RP) LC and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) for identification and separation of the PIPs, with respect to the phosphate groups and fatty acid chains, using electrospray ionization (ESI) MS was investigated. In preliminary studies, HILIC chromatography of a phosphate-containing compound was performed with a ZIC-HILIC (0. 3 x 150 mm, 3. 5 μm) column, using a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile (ACN) / 20 mM ammonium acetate (NH 4 Ac) (79 / 21, v/v). It was discovered that HILIC separations of a phosphate-containing standard could result in a large peak splitting and was dependent on sample solvent. The best peak shape was obtained when the sample was dissolved in more than 60 % ACN and 20 mM NH 4 Ac. <b>Injectors,</b> <b>loops,</b> tubings, nuts, ferrules, columns and a syringe of PEEK were applied to decrease adsorption and increase the detection of PIPs. MS detection of PIPs is challenging, but by including appropriate additives to the mobile phase, detection improved largely. Additives that provided high pH in the mobile phase were found to be the most appropriate. PIPs containing various fatty acid chains could be separated on a C 4 (1. 0 x 5. 0 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å) column using a mobile phase consisting of MeOH/ 20 mM TEA at pH 10. 0 (80 / 20, v/v). PIPs containing the same fatty acid chains, but different number of phosphate groups, could not be separated using the same C 4 column. However, separation according to number of phosphate groups was possible using a ZIC-pHILIC (2. 1 x 150 mm, 5 μm) column with a mobile phase consisting of ACN/ 10 mM (NH 4) 2 CO 3 / 0. 2 % NH 4 OH at pH 10. 0 (55 / 45, v/v). However, the retention window was small, and optimizing parameters such as temperature, water and the ion concentration in the mobile phase did not increase the retention of the PIPs. Hence, separation of PIPs on a ZIC-pHILIC column using ESI-MS is possible, but with several limitations. Nonetheless, a combination of a ZIC-pHILIC column and a RP column in a two-dimensional (2 D) system using ESI-MS may be suitable to determine the different PIP isomers...|$|R
