Using Lavinia's books on witchcraft, she and K-9 deduce it must occur at midnight on the winter solstice, now just a few short hours away. The where of it is more elusive, however, causing the duo to drive around the shire <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> churches. As the last few minutes before midnight tick away, they finally realise that there's an abandoned chapel on Lavinia's property. Rushing home, K-9 and Sarah are briefly upset at missing something that was right under their noses all along.|$|E

500|$|Peirce {{wanted to}} tell the story from Brandon's perspective. She was {{familiar}} with Brandon's desire to wear men's clothing: [...] "I started <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other coverage {{and a great deal of}} it was sensational. People were focusing on the spectacle of a girl who had passed as a boy because that is so unfamiliar to so many people. Where to me, I knew girls who had passed as boys, so Brandon was not some weird person to me. Brandon was a very familiar person." [...] Peirce was influenced by the public perception of the case, believing the American public were generally misinformed: she said, [...] "People were also focusing on the crime without giving it much emotional understanding and I think that's really dangerous, especially with this culture of violence that we live in". Peirce began working on a concept for the film and gave it the working title Take It Like a Man.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles were {{performing}} at Liverpool's Cavern Club in November 1961 {{when they were}} introduced to Brian Epstein after a midday concert. Epstein was a homosexual, and according to biographer Philip Norman, one of Brian's reasons for wanting to manage the group {{was that he was}} physically attracted to Lennon. Almost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, leading to speculation about their relationship. When he was later questioned about it, Lennon said, [...] "Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We used to sit in a café in Torremolinos <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> boys and I'd say, 'Do you like that one? Do you like this one?' I was rather enjoying the experience, thinking like a writer all the time: I am experiencing this." [...] Soon after their return from Spain—at McCartney's twenty-first birthday party in June 1963—Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club Master of ceremonies Bob Wooler for saying [...] "How was your honeymoon, John?" [...] The MC, known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks, was making a joke, but ten months had passed since Lennon's marriage, and the deferred honeymoon was still two months in the future. To Lennon, who was drunk at the time, the matter was simple: [...] "He called me a queer so I battered his bloody ribs in".|$|E
500|$|An {{aspect of}} Chrissie's {{personality}} is her wardrobe and style, with EastEnders costume designer Di Humphreys noting that [...] "Chrissie's clothes reflect her strong, upfront character." [...] According to Oberman the production team was keen to emphasise {{this in the}} manner of her dress: [...] "For Chrissie's wardrobe, we decided she is dressy and over co-ordinated", explaining how the character's fashion sense was informed by her own observations of British expatriates: [...] "When I heard I had the part of Chrissie I was on holiday in Spain, where she had been living, and I remember <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> ex-pat women, and thinking how co-ordinated they are. Their hair is always perfect, their bags match their gloves and shoes and scarves." [...] The show's make-up artist, Elizabeth Armistead, has also spoken of the way Chrissie's [...] "glamorous, polished look" [...] informs her characterisation and personality: [...] "Chrissie's a confident person who rarely leaves anything to chance. Even in moments of despair, though her facial expression reflects her turmoil, she never has a hair out of place." [...] The look was part of a desire to represent the character as a [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "forceful" [...] figure, with one interviewer describing Chrissie as [...] "quite flashy" [...] and [...] "glam". According to Humprehys this is manifested in [...] "Chrissie’s outfits, [...] are a mixture of designer and High Street... Chrissie's got a great sense of style. She makes High Street clothes look made to measure." [...] Oberman felt Chrissie's fashion sensibilities to be a critical element of the character: [...] "she's like Angie with 15 more years of Sex and The City thrown in", referring to an American televisied serial notable for fashion. Even before stepping foot on set Oberman spent eight hours with Humphreys shopping for Chrissie's clothes at Selfridges where they [...] "spent a fortune!" [...] The character's highly stylised representation on-screen earned Oberman the award for best-dressed soap star in 2005, and reflected Chrissie's new-found role as the [...] "voluptuous landlady" [...] of The Queen Vic. In the media the character was widely regarded as the show's ultimate femme fatale and resident [...] "sex symbol", being described by John Dingwall of the Daily Record as Walford's [...] "black widow".|$|E

To this end, the courts must find a sufficient relationship to this effect, where issues of vicarious liability are raised.
