40|$|One {{method of}} {{measuring}} {{the prices of}} deposit and <b>loan</b> <b>services</b> is to view the differentials between actual loan and deposit interest rates and appropriate “reference rates ” as the “indirectly measured prices of deposit and <b>loan</b> <b>services.</b> ” In fact, the ONS in the UK and the BLS in the US are considering the adoption {{of this type of}} estimation method for their measurements of deposit and <b>loan</b> <b>services</b> prices. This paper reviews the prior research at the ONS and BLS, identifies the problem points, and examines the feasibility of using published interest rate data “of a constant quality ” to indirectly measure deposit and <b>loan</b> <b>services</b> prices in Japan. The conclusions show: (1) published interest rate data that is indicative and “of a constant quality ” is not available for certain lending rates; and (2) there are logical inconsistencies between the published-interest-rate-data-based method for measuring deposit and <b>loan</b> <b>service</b> prices which is examined in this paper and the input-output tables, which are presently utilized to determine the weights of individual service prices in the Corporate Service Price Index (CSPI). Consequently, the paper concludes that {{it would be difficult to}} incorporate indirectly measured deposit and <b>loan</b> <b>service</b> prices in the CSPI. * The author would like to thank Professor Takanobu Nakajima of Keio University for his useful comments during th...|$|R
