500|$|The {{memory of}} her father {{apparently}} motivated Maria Amélia's dedication to her education. The late Duke of Braganza cast a large shadow in her life, and was always remembered by his daughter, who would often ask the people around her: [...] "and my father, who <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> from heaven, shall he be pleased with his daughter?" [...] She was never quite {{able to cope with}} her father's death and it deeply touched her. Maria Amélia remarked after she saw a garden where Pedro planted a sycamore: [...] "A profound sadness invaded me when contemplating these trees, which had survived my father and probably shall survive all of us. It is an image of human fragility. Man is the most frail of all beings; he dies, while the objects which were seemingly created for his use, endure the centuries!... But I am digressing in my melancholic reflections".|$|E
500|$|Egan {{joked that}} {{although}} [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] was [...] "fun" [...] to perform, she felt much more [...] "white" [...] than usual recording alongside the five singers {{cast as the}} Muses, who provide the song's back up vocals. Familiar with singers Cheryl Freeman, Lillias White, Vaneese Y. Thomas, LaChanze and Roz Ryan's Broadway work, Egan felt intimated by their powerful voices and riffing abilities. Egan recalled, [...] "Alan would say, 'Okay Lillias (White), just do a riff over there and LaChanze, you do a little something over here and Susan, just at the end, get from this note to this note and just do a riff.' I raise my hand and I'm like, 'Umm, can you plunk {{it out on the}} piano?' He <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like, 'Are you kidding?'" [...] While it took Egan half an hour to solidify only one of her riffs, the other singers recorded multiple takes of theirs within that same time; Egan was greatly humbled by the experience. On the film's soundtrack, only Egan and Freeman are credited as vocalists on the track. Menken also produced the song. Danny Troob arranged the song while Michael Kosarin conducted the orchestration.|$|E
500|$|By May 1999, {{the group}} was nearing {{platinum}} status for Dude Ranch and sales targets were higher for Enema of the State. The Los Angeles Times ran a Sunday feature on the band two days prior to release, noting that [...] "The musicians are sanguine about chances to repeat or exceed the sales of Dude Ranch, noting the always-shifting sands of pop culture and that they've already done better than they'd ever anticipated." [...] Momentum began to build when US radio stations received advance copies of Enema of the State. MCA issued Enema of the State on June 1, and the release peaked at number nine on the U.S. Billboard 200. The album chart was gripped by the Backstreet Boys' Millennium, but Enema of the State still managed to move 109,000 units that week. The band was supporting Lagwagon in Europe when MCA executives phoned the trio about rising record sales. Joey Cape, frontman of Lagwagon, remarked that [...] "They were selling, like, 90,000 records a day [...] I was saying things like, 'What are you doing here? Go home! Why {{do you want to}} be on tour with Lagwagon right now?" [...] At a show shortly following the release of the album, DeLonge was approached by Noodles from The Offspring to congratulate him. [...] "He <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> right in the eyes and he goes, 'You're next,'" [...] remembered DeLonge, who blushed and shook off the compliment.|$|E

2500|$|Problematic point(s): phonologically speaking, verbal prefixes {{are always}} {{attached}} to the following verb, {{even if it is}} an auxiliary verb wedged inbetween, which loses its own stress. For example: megfog means ’catch’ and megnéz means ’see, have a look.’ Thus, megfogom a lepkét ’I’ll catch the butterfly’ but meg fogom nézni ’I’m going to see it.’ In the first example, meg belongs to fogom; in the second, meg belongs to nézni. The pronunciation is [...] in both cases. These cases can be distinguished, though, by considering the word elements. On the other hand, verbal prefixes with personal suffixes can never be written together with the main verb, even though they are stressed the same way as unsuffixed prefixes, e.g. rám néz, rád néz but ránéz ’s/he <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> you, him/her.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{foreign-born}} {{woman and}} usurper of the Russian throne, Catherine the Great held no legitimate {{claim to the}} crown. Her sole connection with the house of Romanov derived from her marriage to the late Emperor, Peter III, whose murder she was widely known to have orchestrated. The royals who held genealogical claims to the throne overtly devised plots to replace the new Tsarina. Both Ivan VI and Paul I, armed with supporters, threatened Catherine's rule, {{as well as the}} guards who possessed the military might to overthrow the Empress. In a letter to Voltaire on September 21, 1762, Catherine acknowledged the conspirators and potential traitors all around her: [...] "Every guardsman when he <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> can say: 'I made that woman.'" [...] A shrewd politician, Catherina also knew she needed the support of the Court, the public, and other powerful regimes in order to maintain power, suppress rebellion, and emerge as a leading world power.|$|E
2500|$|According to Washburn, he and Cimino {{spent three}} days {{together}} in Los Angeles at the Sunset Marquis, hammering out the plot. The script eventually went through several drafts, evolving into a story with three distinct acts. Washburn did not interview any veterans to write The Deer Hunter nor do any research. [...] "I had a month, that was it," [...] he explains. [...] "The clock was ticking. Write the fucking script! But all I {{had to do was}} watch TV. Those combat cameramen in Vietnam were out there in the field with the guys. I mean, they had stuff that you wouldn't dream of seeing about Iraq." [...] When Washburn was finished, he says, Cimino and Joann Carelli, an associate producer on The Deer Hunter who went on to produce two more of Cimino's later films, took him to dinner at a cheap restaurant off the Sunset Strip. He recalls, [...] "We finished, and Joann <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> across the table, and she says, 'Well, Deric, it's fuck-off time.' I was fired. It was a classic case: you get a dummy, get him to write the goddamn thing, tell him to go fuck himself, put your name on the thing, and he'll go away. I was so tired, I didn't care. I'd been working 20 hours a day for a month. I got on the plane the next day, and I went back to Manhattan and my carpenter job." ...|$|E
