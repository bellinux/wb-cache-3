5|$|Yellowstone {{forests are}} {{dominated}} by the <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pine</b> and are eventually replaced by other tree species after 80 to 100years as a forest matures. In Yellowstone, a very short growing season due to high altitude and relatively poor soils allows the <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pine</b> to reach ages approaching three hundred years before other trees such as Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir become established. The lodgepole pines found throughout the Yellowstone Plateau high country grow in uninterrupted dense stands averaging similar ages in various groupings. Though trees normally found in more mature forests do occur, they are not found in large stands as in other forests in the Rocky Mountains. By the 1980s much of the <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pine</b> forests in Yellowstone were between 200 and 250years old and approaching {{the end of their}} lifecycle.|$|E
5|$|The {{predominant}} tree in Yellowstone, the <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pine,</b> fared poorly from the fires, except {{in areas where}} the heat and flames were very mild. The <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pine</b> is serotinous and often produces pine cones that remain closed and will not disperse seeds unless subjected to fire. Research of test plots established after the fires indicated that the best seed dispersal occurred in areas which had experienced severe ground fires, and that seed dispersal was lowest in areas which had only minor surface burns. Regions with crown fires sometimes had the highest rates of regeneration of <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pine</b> after 5years. However, the rate of lodgepole regeneration was not uniform, with some areas seeing extremely high densities of new growth while other areas had less. Stands of dead lodgepole killed by the fires may persist for decades, rising above new growth and providing habitat for birds and other wildlife.|$|E
5|$|Other pest {{include the}} coconut hispine beetle, Brontispa longissima, which feeds on young leaves, {{seedlings}} and mature coconut trees, causing serious economic {{damage in the}} Philippines. The mountain pine beetle is a destructive pest of mature or weakened <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pine,</b> sometimes affecting large areas of Canada.|$|E

5|$|Banff National Park spans three ecoregions, {{including}} montane, subalpine, and alpine. The subalpine ecoregion, {{which consists}} mainly of dense forest, comprises 53percent of Banff's area. 27percent {{of the park}} is located above the tree line, in the alpine ecoregion. The tree line in Banff lies approximately at , with open meadows at alpine regions and some areas covered by glaciers. A small portion (3percent) of the park, located at lower elevations, is in the montane ecoregion. <b>Lodgepole</b> <b>pine</b> forests dominate the montane region of Banff, with Engelmann spruce, willow, aspen, occasional Douglas-fir and a few Douglas maple interspersed. Engelmann spruce are {{more common in the}} subalpine regions of Banff, with some areas of <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pine,</b> and subalpine fir. The montane areas in the Bow Valley, which tend to be the preferred habitat for wildlife, have been subjected to significant human development over the years.|$|E
5|$|The alpine biome of {{the pass}} extends below it {{on either side}} to an {{elevation}} of approximately , or about the altitude of the Linkins Lake trailhead on the western side, Highway 82's uppermost crossing of the Roaring Fork. Below it is a subalpine zone where <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pine,</b> Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir and aspen dominate the forest. A few patches of those trees persist above that elevation, but they are mostly stunted krummholz.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountain}} pine beetle {{is a native}} insect species that is known to experience large outbreaks that infest forest groves, and is particularly common in areas with numerous lodgepole pines and fir trees. A large infestation occurred from 1995 through 2003, and the beetle wiped out areas of <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pine</b> in the SNRA, an area historically too cold for outbreaks to occur.|$|E
50|$|The squirrelpox {{virus is}} {{predicted}} to spread by the grey squirrels as they act as a vector for the virus. Further, a separate model examining {{the effects of the}} spread of the grey squirrel on the health of Scots and <b>Lodgepole</b> <b>pines</b> showed that grey squirrels will spread Red Band Needle Blight (RBNB), decreasing the population of <b>Lodgepole</b> <b>pines</b> exponentially, and that Scot pine populations will decrease slower due to fungal growth resulting from the bark-stripping behavior of the grey squirrel.|$|R
50|$|The {{area was}} created out of <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pines,</b> bristlecone pines, and Douglas firs. The {{base of the}} {{mountain}} is located at 10050 ft and the summit is at about 10650 ft.|$|R
500|$|Mountain pine beetles {{have caused}} a number of {{large-scale}} infestations in Banff National Park, feeding on the phloem of mature <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pines.</b> Alberta's first known outbreak occurred in 1940, infecting [...] of forest in Banff. A second major outbreak occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Banff and the surrounding Rocky Mountains region.|$|R
5|$|The {{summit of}} Mount Elbert is an alpine environment, {{featuring}} {{plants such as}} Phacelia sericea (sky-pilot), Hymenoxys grandiflora (old-man-of-the-mountain), and Geum rossii (alpine avens). Also noted are Carex atrata var. pullata, Salix desertorum, Platanthera hyperborea, Thalictrum fendleri, Aquilegia canadensis, Chenopodium album, Gentiana detonsa var. hallii, and Bigelovia parryi. Below treeline the mountain is heavily forested, with the lower slopes covered {{with a mixture of}} <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pine,</b> spruce, aspen and fir.|$|E
5|$|Going {{higher in}} elevation, the {{coniferous}} forests become purer stands of red fir, western white pine, Jeffrey pine, <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pine,</b> {{and the occasional}} foxtail pine. Fewer wildlife species tend {{to be found in}} these habitats, because of their higher elevation and lower complexity. Species likely to be found include golden-mantled ground squirrel, chickaree, fisher, Steller's jay, hermit thrush, and northern goshawk. Reptiles are not common, but include rubber boa, western fence lizard, and northern alligator lizard.|$|E
5|$|The Cascade Range is {{dramatically}} different in climate from west to east. The west side is heavily forested and features trees such as Douglas firs, western hemlock, Pacific silver firs, and Alaska yellow cedars. East of the Cascades, where Yamsay lies, the climate becomes much drier, even arid. Precipitation significantly declines and vegetation becomes more sparse, with <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pine,</b> white fir, ponderosa pine, and juniper. To the south, chaparral {{plants such as}} beargrass and bitterbrush prevail.|$|E
50|$|The John Muir Wilderness {{contains}} the largest contiguous area above 10000 ft {{in the continental}} United States. It contains large areas of subalpine meadows and fellfields above 10800 ft, containing stands of whitebark and foxtail pine. From 9000 ft to 10800 ft, the wilderness is dominated by <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pines.</b> Below the <b>lodgepole</b> forest is forest dominated by Jeffrey pine.|$|R
50|$|Mountain pine beetles {{have caused}} a number of {{large-scale}} infestations in Banff National Park, feeding on the phloem of mature <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pines.</b> Alberta's first known outbreak occurred in 1940, infecting 43 km2 of forest in Banff. A second major outbreak occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Banff and the surrounding Rocky Mountains region.|$|R
50|$|There are {{different}} views regarding beetle kill in Colorado. Some {{view it as}} a natural cycle while others believe it should be prevented. Unfortunately, such prevention measures are very expensive and not practical. Chemical treatments applied to <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pines</b> in the spring is effective, but the costs are $50 per tree in addition to annual treatments as needed.|$|R
5|$|As the {{landscape}} rises, trees become {{smaller and more}} sparse, with stands broken by areas of exposed granite. These include <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pine,</b> whitebark pine, and mountain hemlock that, at highest elevations, give way to vast expanses of granite as treeline is reached. The climate in these habitats is harsh and the growing season is short, but species such as pika, yellow-bellied marmot, white-tailed jackrabbit, Clark's nutcracker, and black rosy finch are adapted to these conditions. Also, the treeless alpine habitats are the areas favored by Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep. This species, however, is now found in the Yosemite area only around Tioga Pass, where a small, reintroduced population exists.|$|E
5|$|Suillus luteus is {{a pioneer}} species that {{typically}} establishes {{itself in the}} early stages of forest succession. The fungus forms mycorrhizal associations with various species of pine, including Scots pine (P.sylvestris), black pine (P.nigra), and Macedonian pine (P.peuce) in Europe, and red pine (P.resinosa) and white pine (P.strobus) in North America. An in vitro experiment demonstrated that the species could form an ectomycorrhizal association with Aleppo pine (P.halepensis), a key species used in reforestation in the Mediterranean. A study of the ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with a <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pine</b> (P.contorta) invasion front near Coyhaique, Chile, showed that many invasive trees were supported by S.luteus as the sole mycorrhizal partner.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Adams {{gives it a}} large amount of {{diversity}} within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, grand fir and Douglas fir dominate the forest with Western hemlock and Western red cedar as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and ponderosa pine are dominant with some patches of dense <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pine.</b> Western hemlock and Western red cedar also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by Pacific silver fir and noble fir; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pine</b> also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases further, the forest changes again with subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and mountain hemlock becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant whitebark pine and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the dominant species are Western white pine, Sitka spruce, Western larch, Pacific yew, Alaska cedar, and mountain juniper. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species big leaf maple, Oregon white oak, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and red alder. Large shrubs/small trees include the dwarf birch, Suksdorf’s hawthorn, California hazelnut, bitter cherry, vine maple, Douglas maple, and blue elderberry and contribute to a vibrant fall display.|$|E
5000|$|The Beetle Kill Trade Association {{has been}} {{established}} to “to unite and align the self interests of business invested in or interested in the removal and recycling of standing beetle killed <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pines</b> in order to remove obstacles {{to the creation of}} a viable, vibrant and sustainable market for products utilizing beetle kill pines as raw material.” ...|$|R
5|$|Due to {{a higher}} {{elevation}} and level of precipitation, the Black Hills ecology differs significantly from the plains. The mountains are thickly blanketed by various types of pines, including ponderosa and <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pines,</b> as well as spruces. Black Hills mammals include deer, elk (wapiti), bighorn sheep, mountain goats, pine marten, and mountain lions, while the streams and lakes contain several species of trout.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} {{commonly}} found in the Rocky Mountains of Idaho and the Pacific Northwest. It is less common in the lake states. The species fruits in the summer in the Rocky Mountains. Also, the species fruits in autumn along the Pacific coast and in the lake states. The species is by itself or scattered in mixed forests. The species can commonly be found under <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pines</b> or other two-needle pines. It is rarely found under jack pines.|$|R
5|$|The role of {{wildfire}} is {{an important}} one for plant and animal species diversity. Many tree species have evolved to mainly germinate after a wildfire. Regions of the park that have experienced wildfire in historical times have greater species diversity after reestablishment than those regions that have not been influenced by fire. Though the Yellowstone fires of 1988 had minimal impact on Grand Teton National Park, studies conducted before and reaffirmed after that event concluded than the suppression of natural wildfires during the middle part of the 20th century decreased plant species diversity and natural regeneration of plant communities. One study conducted 15 years before the 1988 Yellowstone National Park fires concluded that human suppression of wildfire had adversely impacted Aspen tree groves and other forest types. The majority of conifer species in Grand Teton National Park are heavily dependent on wildfire and this is particularly true of the <b>Lodgepole</b> <b>Pine.</b> Though extremely hot canopy or crown fires tend to kill <b>Lodgepole</b> <b>Pine</b> seeds, lower severity surface fires usually result in a higher post wildfire regeneration of this species. In accordance with {{a better understanding of the}} role wildfire plays in the environment, the National Park Service and other land management agencies have developed Fire Management Plans which provide a strategy for wildfire management and are expected to best enhance the natural ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|Amanita gemmata is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, {{meaning it}} forms a mutually beneficial relationship with the roots of compatible host plants. Through the association, the plant provides the fungus with a carbon source, and the fungus provides the plant with several benefits such as nutrients and protection from pathogens. Largent and collaborators (1980) document mycorrhizal associations of A.gemmata with Manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.) and <b>Lodgepole</b> <b>Pine</b> (Pinus contorta), and Nieto and Carbone with Maritime Pine (Pinus pinaster) in Spain. The fungus favours sandy and slightly acidic soils, and is often found in association with Norway Spruce (Picea abies). The mushroom grows either singly, scattered, or in groups in coniferous and mixed forests, especially along paths and roads.|$|E
5|$|The Red {{fire started}} near Lewis Lake on July 1 {{and like the}} Shoshone fire, {{advanced}} little for several weeks. The fire then moved northeast on July 19 and combined with the Shoshone fire in August. As these two fires advanced towards the Grant Village area, evacuations were ordered so fire fighting crews could concentrate on structure protection. In {{the midst of a}} large <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pine</b> forest, the Grant Village complex was the first major tourist area impacted that season. A number of small structures and some of the campground complex were destroyed. After the Red and Shoshone fires combined, they were referred to as the Shoshone fire, since it was much larger.|$|E
5000|$|The botanical {{diversity}} of the Trinity Alps is quite unique. The region has intrigued botanists for many years because of the predominance of the Sierran flora only 60 mi from the Pacific Ocean. Conifers common in the Sierra Nevada such as foxtail <b>pines,</b> <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pines,</b> western white pines, whitebark pines, ponderosa pines, red firs, and white firs are also common in the Alps alongside the endemic Brewer spruce. [...] Large wildfires swept through the western forests in recent years.|$|R
5|$|As {{wildfire}} is {{a natural}} part of most ecosystems, plants that are indigenous to Yellowstone have adapted in a variety of ways. Douglas-fir have a thick bark which protects the inner section of the tree from most fires. <b>Lodgepole</b> <b>Pines</b> —the most common tree species in the park— generally have cones that are only opened by the heat of fire. Their seeds are held in place by a tough resin, and fire assists in melting the resin, allowing the seeds to disperse. Fire clears out dead and downed wood, providing fewer obstacles for <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pines</b> to flourish. Subalpine Fir, Engelmann Spruce, Whitebark Pine, and other species tend to grow in colder and moister areas, where fire is less likely to occur. Aspen trees sprout new growth from their roots, and even if a severe fire kills the tree above ground, the roots often survive unharmed because they are insulated from the heat by soil. The National Park Service estimates that in natural conditions, grasslands in Yellowstone burned an average of every 20 to 25 years, while forests in the park would experience fire about every 300 years.|$|R
50|$|The {{damage caused}} by the Meadow Fire was severe. The high-intensity {{wildfire}} burned very hot and, in some areas, the large fir and <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pines</b> were reduced to charcoal stalagmites. The forest floor was slow to recover {{because of the lack}} of moisture during the California drought. During the summer of 2015, greenery was scarce and the forest floor was still covered in a thick layer of ash. However, scientists predict that the coniferous forest will regenerate after a few years despite the drought.|$|R
5|$|The {{headwaters}} of the Snake River and the high mountains elsewhere in the watershed were historically heavily forested. These include aspen, Douglas fir, and spruce fir, comprising about 20% of the historic watershed. At the base of mountains and in the Lost River basin, sagebrush was and is the predominant vegetation cover. Because of deforestation, up to {{one quarter of the}} forests have been taken over by sagebrush, leaving the remaining forests to cover about 15% of the watershed. However, the <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pine</b> has increased in number, taking over historic stands of other conifers. There are also up to 118 species of rare or endemic plants that occur in the Snake River watershed.|$|E
5|$|The same {{applies to}} herbivores, animals that eat plants, {{and the plants}} that they eat. In the Rocky Mountains, red {{squirrels}} and crossbills (seed-eating birds) compete for seeds of the <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pine.</b> The squirrels get at pine seeds by gnawing through the cone scales, whereas the crossbills get at the seeds by extracting them with their unusual crossed mandibles. In areas where there are squirrels, the lodgepole's cones are heavier, and have fewer seeds and thinner scales, {{making it more difficult}} for squirrels to get at the seeds. Conversely, where there are crossbills but no squirrels, the cones are lighter in construction, but have thicker scales, making it more difficult for crossbills to get at the seeds. The lodgepole's cones are in an evolutionary arms race with the two kinds of herbivore.|$|E
5|$|Banff National Park has a subarctic climate {{with three}} ecoregions, {{including}} montane, subalpine, and alpine. The forests {{are dominated by}} <b>Lodgepole</b> <b>pine</b> at lower elevations and Engelmann spruce in higher ones below the treeline, above which is primarily rocks and ice. Mammal species such as the grizzly, cougar, wolverine, elk, bighorn sheep and moose are found, along with hundreds of bird species. Reptiles and amphibians are also found but {{only a limited number}} of species have been recorded. The mountains are formed from sedimentary rocks which were pushed east over newer rock strata, between 80 and 55million years ago. Over the past few million years, glaciers have at times covered most of the park, but today are found only on the mountain slopes though they include the Columbia Icefield, the largest uninterrupted glacial mass in the Rockies. Erosion from water and ice have carved the mountains into their current shapes.|$|E
50|$|Bear Lake is a high-elevation lake in a {{spruce and}} fir forest {{at the base}} of Hallett Peak and Flattop Mountain. Bierstadt Lake sits atop a lateral moraine named Bierstadt Moraine, and drains into Mill Creek. There are several trails that lead to Bierstadt Lake through groves of aspens and <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pines.</b> North of Bierstadt Moraine is Hollowell Park, a large and marshy meadow along Mill Creek. The Hollowell Park trail runs along Steep Mountain's south side. Ranches, lumber and sawmill {{enterprises}} operated in Hollowell Park into the early 1900s.|$|R
50|$|In the subalpine zone, <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pines</b> and {{huckleberry}} {{have established}} themselves in previous burn areas. Crystal clear lakes and fields of wildflowers are hidden among the trees. Mammals of the subalpine zone include bobcats, cougars, coyotes, elk, mule deer, chipmunks, shrews, porcupines and yellow-bellied marmots. Black bears are {{attracted by the}} berries and seeds of subalpine forests. Clark's nutcracker, Steller's jay, mountain chickadee and yellow-rumped warbler {{are some of the}} many birds found in the subalpine zone. Sprague Lake and Odessa Lake are two of the park's subalpine lakes.|$|R
50|$|The sparse {{woodlands}} of widely scattered western junipers and <b>lodgepole</b> <b>pines</b> are {{interrupted by}} patches of montane chaparral {{species such as}} pinemat manzanita, huckleberry oak, and mountain pride penstemon clinging to the expanses of barren rock. There are many wet meadows throughout the wilderness, each unique due to the differences in elevation, exposure, soil composition and soil depth, resulting in a wide diversity of annual and perennial plant life. A variety of wildflower species, sedges, and grasses inhabit these fragile wet areas. Aspen and willow are common to these wetland areas.|$|R
