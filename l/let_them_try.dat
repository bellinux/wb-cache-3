25|$|Assigning jobs in occupations {{that women}} had never held before was a {{daunting}} task. By social custom, working {{women did not}} work in the trades and rarely supervised men. Women worked mainly in offices, classrooms, hospitals, retail stores, libraries, and beauty shops. In 1943, Marine Corps manpower was in short supply, but members of the WR were available {{to pick up the}} slack. However, the corps had to select, train, classify, and assign the women to jobs where they could contribute and do so in the shortest amount of time. After completing their Marine Corps indoctrination training, selected women received advanced schooling in a variety of specialties. By {{the end of the war}} 9,641 members of the WR had attended more than 30 specialist schools run by higher educational institutions, the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. Colonel Streeter's philosophy was to <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>try</b> anything, except heavy lifting and combat. The WR strength on 1June 1945 was 17,672. Of this number 1,342 were engaged in occupations classified as professional or semi-professional; 10,279 in clerical; 741 in sales; 587 in services; 344 in skilled trades; 1,305 as semi-skilled; 14 as unskilled; 35 as students; and 6 as unaccounted for. Marine Corps recruiting literature indicated there were over 200 types of jobs available in the WR. While this may have been correct, the fact was that well over half the women were assigned to and worked in clerical fields. The first duty posts and stations for the WR included places such as Washington, D.C.; New York; Philadelphia; Chicago; San Diego; and Quantico, Virginia. Marine aviation was the fastest-growing unit of the Corps. Both officers and enlisted women served at Marine Corps Air Stations including Cherry Point and Edenton, North Carolina; Paris Island, South Carolina; El Centro, El Toro, Mojave, and Santa Barbara, California.|$|E
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to deflect the pressure, Carney and PRTEU {{contacted}} [...] Virginia congressman Howard W. Smith, {{who at the time}} was the Chair of the House Committee to Investigate Executive Agencies. Smith, known for his segregationist views and eager to embarrass and possibly destroy the FEPC, quickly scheduled a hearing. In the meantime, the union informed the PTC that it refused to comply with the FEPC order, and the PTC management told Ross that, given the union's position, the PTC would not comply with the FEPC directive either. [...] The hearing in front of Smith's committee took place on January 11, 1944. The hearing was inconclusive, with Ross reiterating the FEPC position, and the union representatives falling back on the [...] "customs clause" [...] and their claims about seniority issues. Several white workers testifying at the hearing predicted that there would be trouble and unrest if promotions of black employees at the PTC were allowed: [...] "We are not going to accept them [...] as fellow workers. ... We are not going to work with them. If anybody believe it, <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>try</b> it". A petition, signed by 1776 workers, presented at the hearing, read: [...] "Gentlemen: We, the white employees of the Philadelphia Transportation Co., refuse to work with Negroes as motormen, conductors, operators and station trainmen".|$|E
2500|$|A {{few days}} later Bakiyev commented from his {{hometown}} of Osh {{that he would not}} resign and called for the UN to send troops to the country to restore order. A rally in his hometown was followed by another bigger rally giving him support in his quest to return to the seat of government. In response the interim Interior Minister said an arrest warrant would be issued for him while his immunity was removed. On 13 April, Bakiyev said he would resign should his security and that of his family and entourage be guaranteed. He said [...] "In what case would I resign? First of all, they should guarantee that in Kyrgyzstan there are no more people walking around with weapons, and no seizures or redistribution of property. Also, I need to know that my own security and the security of members of my family and those close to me will be assured." [...] The interim government said it could only guarantee his security should he resign and leave the country. Tension mounted in the country when the interim government threatened to hunt down Bakiyev while simultaneously offering an olive branch should he go to into exile. In response Bakiyev said [...] "Let them try to seize me. <b>Let</b> <b>them</b> <b>try</b> to kill me. I believe this will lead to such a great deal of bloodshed which no one will be able to justify." [...] During a nuclear summit in Washington the Russian President Dmitry Medvedev suggested Kyrgyzstan was {{in the throes of a}} civil war and that it could turn into a [...] "second Afghanistan" [...] if the political deadlock was not resolved. He said that [...] "The risk of Kyrgyzstan breaking apart – into the south and the north – really exist." [...] On 14 April 2010, interim leader Roza Otunbayeva announced that President Bakiyev, his defense minister, as well as relatives in government and political allies would face trial over the deaths of protesters. A Kyrgyz court issued an arrest warrant for Bakiyev's brother Janybek Bakiyev, eldest son Marat Bakiyev and former Prime Minister Daniar Usenov.|$|E
