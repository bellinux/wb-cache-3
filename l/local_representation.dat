5|$|The Maryland House of Delegates is {{the lower}} house of the Maryland General Assembly, the state {{legislature}} of the U.S. State of Maryland. Three delegates are elected from each district, though some districts are divided into sub-districts. In the original state constitution, four delegates were elected from each county to one-year terms, and two were elected {{from each of the}} major early cities of Baltimore and Annapolis. Reforms in the 1830s, however, led to the apportionment of delegates by population rather than geography, and by 1922, delegates served four year terms. The modern system of apportionment of seats began in 1972, when 47 districts of roughly equal population were identified, although sub-districts were created to ensure <b>local</b> <b>representation</b> for areas with too little population to warrant an entire district.|$|E

40|$|In image labeling, <b>local</b> <b>representations</b> for image {{units are}} usually {{generated}} from their surrounding image patches, thus long-range contextual {{information is not}} effectively encoded. In this paper, we introduce recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to address this issue. Specifically, directed acyclic graph RNNs (DAG-RNNs) are proposed to process DAG-structured images, which enables the network to model long-range semantic dependencies among image units. Our DAG-RNNs are capable of tremendously enhancing the discriminative power of <b>local</b> <b>representations,</b> which significantly benefits the local classification. Meanwhile, we propose a novel class weighting function that attends to rare classes, which phenomenally boosts the recognition accuracy for non-frequent classes. Integrating with convolution and deconvolution layers, our DAG-RNNs achieve new state-of-the-art results on the challenging SiftFlow, CamVid and Barcelona benchmarks...|$|R

During federal and provincial elections, Windsorites have maintained its <b>local</b> <b>representation</b> in the respective legislatures. The Liberal Party of Canada also has a strong electoral history in the city. Canada's 21st Prime Minister Paul Martin was born in Windsor. His father Paul Martin (Sr.), a federal cabinet minister in several portfolios through the Liberal governments of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, was first elected to the House of Commons from a Windsor riding in the 1930s. Martin (Sr.) practiced law {{in the city and}} the federal building on Ouellette Avenue is named after him. Eugene Whelan was a Liberal cabinet minister and one-time Liberal party leadership candidate elected from Essex County from the 1960s to the early 1980s, as well as Mark MacGuigan of Windsor-Walkerville riding, who also served as External Affairs, and later Justice minister in the early 1980s. Deputy Prime Minister Herb Gray represented Windsor as an MP from 1962 through 2003, winning thirteen consecutive elections making him the longest serving MP in Canadian history. A bust of Herb Gray is located at the foot of Ouellette Avenue near Dieppe Park in downtown Windsor. Plans are to name the Windsor-Essex Parkway after him.|$|E

500|$|From Saxon times Widnes {{was part}} of the hundred of West Derby in Lancashire. Modern local {{government}} in the town of Widnes commenced with the creation of the Widnes Local Board in 1865, prior to which the town {{had been part of the}} administrative district of Prescot. [...] In 1892 the town received a Charter of Incorporation giving it borough status. In 1974, as part of the Local Government Act 1972, Widnes Borough Council was abolished and its territory amalgamated with Runcorn to form the borough of Halton. This became a district of Cheshire, the outcome of <b>local</b> <b>representation</b> to avoid becoming part of the proposed metropolitan county of Merseyside. In 1998 the borough of Halton became a unitary authority. However, in 2009 the council entered into an agreement with the five metropolitan district councils of Merseyside to form the Liverpool City Region, in effect reversing its opposition to integration in the 1970s; its unitary status is similar to that of the metropolitan boroughs.|$|E
500|$|The Whiskey Rebellion (also {{known as}} the Whiskey Insurrection) was a tax protest in the United States {{beginning}} in 1791 during the presidency of George Washington. The so-called [...] "whiskey tax" [...] was the first tax imposed on a domestic product by the newly formed federal government. It became law in 1791, and was intended to generate revenue for the war debt incurred during the Revolutionary War. [...] The tax applied to all distilled spirits, but American whiskey {{was by far the}} country's most popular distilled beverage in the 18th century, so the excise became widely known as a [...] "whiskey tax". Farmers of the western frontier were accustomed to distilling their surplus rye, barley, wheat, corn, or fermented grain mixtures into whiskey. These farmers resisted the tax. In these regions, whiskey often served as a medium of exchange. Many of the resisters were war veterans who believed that they were fighting for the principles of the American Revolution, in particular against taxation without <b>local</b> <b>representation,</b> while the federal government maintained that the taxes were the legal expression of Congressional taxation powers.|$|E

The proposed control laws exhibit highly oscillatory components both for tracking and feedback stabilization of <b>local</b> <b>representations</b> of nonholonomic systems on Lie groups. Applications to the control and analysis of the kinematics of mechanical systems are discussed and numerical simulations are presented...|$|R

60|$|In {{regard to}} the proper {{circumscription}} of the constituencies which elect the local representative bodies, the principle which, when applied as an exclusive and unbending rule to Parliamentary representation, is inappropriate, namely community of local interests, is here the only just and applicable one. The very object of having a <b>local</b> <b>representation</b> is in order {{that those who have}} any interest in common which they do not share with the general body of their countrymen may manage that joint interest by themselves, and the purpose is contradicted if the distribution of the <b>local</b> <b>representation</b> follows any other rule than the grouping of those joint interests. There are local interests peculiar to every town, whether great or small, and common to all its inhabitants; every town, therefore, without distinction of size, ought to have its municipal council. It is equally obvious that every town ought to have but one. The different quarters of the same town have seldom or never any material diversities of local interest; they all require to have the same things done, the same expenses incurred; and, except as to their churches, which it is probably desirable to leave under simply parochial management, the same arrangements may be made to serve for all. Paving, lighting, water supply, drainage, port and market regulations, can not, without great waste and inconvenience, be different for different quarters of the same town. The subdivision of London into six or seven independent districts, each with its separate arrangements for local business (several of them without unity of administration even within themselves), prevents the possibility of consecutive or well-regulated co-operation for common objects, precludes any uniform principle for the discharge of local duties, compels the general government to take things upon itself which would be best left to local authorities if there were any whose authority extended to the entire metropolis, and answers no purpose but to keep up the fantastical trappings of that union of modern jobbing and antiquated foppery, the Corporation of the City of London.|$|E

One of the main results [Theorem 20, arXiv: 0707. 2151] was the possibility to select one distinguished operator (up to scalar multiplication) for every choice of a surface S, ideal triangulations λ, λ' and isomorphic <b>local</b> <b>representations</b> ρ, ρ', requiring that the whole family of operators verifies certain Fusion and Composition properties. By analyzing the constructions of arXiv: 0707. 2151, we found a difficulty that we eventually fix by a slightly weaker (but actually optimal) selection procedure. In fact, for every choice of a surface S, ideal triangulations λ, λ' and isomorphic <b>local</b> <b>representations</b> ρ, ρ', we select a finite set of intertwining operators, naturally endowed with a structure of affine space over H_ 1 (S;Z_N) (Z_N is the cyclic group of order N), {{in such a way}} that the whole family of operators verifies augmented Fusion and Composition properties, which incorporate the explicit behavior of the Z_N-actions with respect to such properties. Moreover, this family is minimal among the collections of operators verifying the "weak" Fusion and Composition rules (in practice the ones considered in arXiv: 0707. 2151). In addition, we adapt the derivation of the invariants for pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphisms and their hyperbolic mapping tori made in arXiv: 0707. 2151 and arXiv:math/ 0407086 by using our distinguished family of intertwining operators.
